       "   'content': 'Just how worried should we all be about 42-year-old billionaire Jack Dorsey ? A new podcast interview with fitness guru Ben Greenfield highlights the Twitter founder’s Stoic lifestyle and makes him sound like a member of a cult. Stoicism, writes Harley Monk in a piece in Medium, is primarily about “practicing mindfulness.” The principles are weird. For instance, Principle 3: “Picture life without the people and possessions you have to truly appreciate them.” There are normal things he does, like meditating twice a day and even walking five miles to and from work. But then there is a kookier side. For example, during a 10-day retreat in Pyin Oo Lwin (Burma) in late 2018, he was banned from using gadgets, doing physical exercise, talking and even making eye contact with other humans. At one point his mother noticed he had turned orange, which was the result of too much Beto Kerotine. So he temporarily switched to a more paleo diet. These days it’s lots and lots of Vitamin C. And eating like an anorexic. In the podcast interview, he describes his current daily routines, which involve fasting, intermittent sauna and ice baths and bizarre eating habits. Each morning he basically goes for a polar bear swim by taking a bath in ice cold water. He says it “unlocks his mind.” During the week, he eats only one meal each day — dinner. On the weekend, he fasts. (RELATED: Dorsey Draws Link Between Physical Danger And Twitter Activity) CNBC’s Cat Clifford writes that each evening he engages in ritualistic sauna and ice baths: “First he sits in his barrel sauna (set at 220 degrees) for 15 minutes, then hops into an ice bath (37 degrees) for three minutes. He repeats the process three times, finishing with one minute in the ice bath.” “This guy is the platonic ideal of a rich white person who spends a year at an ashram,” a journo cracked to The Mirror. Ben Dreyfuss, an avid SoulCyclist and the editorial director at Mother Jones, remarked, “Every day Jack Dorsey spends 1 hour mediating in the morning, 1 hour 15 minutes walking to work, 1 hour 15 minutes walking home from work, 1 hour meditating in the evening, 54 minutes jumping between a sauna and ice bath. No wonder Tweetdeck doesn’t work.” But some were more worried about Dorsey than Tweetdeck. “It sounds like Jack Dorsey might have a serious eating disorder,” wrote Manhattan author and writer Caroline Moss. “Walking 5 miles a day while only consuming one meal per weekday and no meals ion weekends is not a wellness hack…it’s a disease.” Amanda Mull, a staff writer at The Atlantic who has written about billionaires with strange dietary habits, says Dorsey’s daily behavior should not be emulated. “I wrote this last time Jack Dorsey talked about his fasting practice, but: I think it’s genuinely very dangerous for someone as influential as he is to preach the virtues of not eating until you hallucinate!” she wrote. Mike Monteiro, co-founder of Mule, an interactive design studio in San Francisco, didn’t sugarcoat his views about how Dorsey is living his life. “Way to promote eating disorders, @jack,” he wrote. “You stupid stupid stupid man.”'},\n",

Not that this matters to most business journalists who are covering and loving Dalio’s weird roadshow because they aren’t very capitalist themselves. Telling most business reporters that “the American Dream is lost,” or “capitalism needs to be reformed” and we must make the “rich” pay their fair share is like offering President Trump three scoops of ice cream for dessert instead of two; you will never hear a word of protest. MORE FROM FOXBUSINESS.COM... This is a shame because Dalio is a particularly odd guy to be calling balls and strikes on capitalism. Yes, Wall Street guys like Dalio know a lot about markets, but they are particularly tone deaf on economics. They know how to make a quick buck on a trade but they know a lot less on how to make something work for the long haul. Dalio fits this profile neatly. He’s a billionaire many times over, not from inventing anything special, but as a market speculator. Now some of my best friends and sources are really good at market speculating, but that doesn’t mean they’re incredibly deep thinkers, and those who say they are, like Dalio, should be judged with a degree of skepticism. First, see Dalio’s book, “ Principles: Life and Work ”, a weird personal manifesto of what he believes are ways to be successful in business and life. Some of his principles are cringe-worthy obvious (PAIN + REFLECTION = PROGRESS), others just cringe worthy pedantic as in the one that advises: “Great planners who don’t execute their plans go nowhere.” Full disclosure: I haven’t read “Principles” but I bet I can probably get more practical self-help advice from a Tony Robbins video. Then listen to the problems he says he’s worried about and how he plans to fix them. Education, or the lack of it in poor communities, is high on his list. He wants to raise to taxes to make sure kids in poor school districts get a better education. Sounds good until you dig a bit deeper and realize that the money he’s raising goes right into the pockets of the teachers unions and education establishment which has spent the past two decades opposing school choice and other reforms that have been proven to benefit poor kids. Dalio has been talking a lot about the gap between the rich and poor, which he says remains disturbingly high and will sow the seeds of violent conflict. Ok, but lots of anecdotal evidence is pointing to the fact that a combination of the Trump tax cuts and a decline in immigration has increased wages on the low end of the scale. Meanwhile, a lot of other quantitative evidence shows the wealth gap grew alarmingly wide during the Obama years, and well after the ravages of the Great Recession, when the Fed printed money making stock speculators like Dalio rich, and expanded social programs that did little for the working class. Finally do a little research on the hedge fund he runs, Bridgewater Associates. Yes it\\'s big ($160 billion in assets) and successful most of the time, but it’s also run like a police-state version of a hedge fund. All meetings are taped and recorded. Secrecy is paramount and the firm is notorious for its strictly enforced non-disclosure agreements. All of which makes sense because we’re dealing with a lot of money here, but also because the place is so damn weird to work at, as I am told by my Wall Street sources who have a first-hand knowledge of the weirdness. In an almost cult like fashion, employees must read and nearly memorize a short version of Dalio’s mind-numbing “Principles” book. But that’s just the beginning. Dalio preaches something called “radical transparency,” where employees gather around and grade investment ideas in one of the investment world’s most hostile work environments, something along the lines of that famous Mexican standoff scene in “Reservoir Dogs” only without guns. People who stumble over one of Dalio’s “Principles” are subjected to what is known as a “public hanging” of ridicule. No wonder the turnover rate at Bridgewater is around 25 percent over approximately a year. All of which wouldn’t be so bad if Dalio and his crew were doing something special in the world. They’re not. They’re charging big bucks for investing money. In fact, they’re not doing anything special as far as investing goes. Since its inception, Bridgewater’s flagship “Pure Alpha Strategy” funds has had an annualized total return of around 12 percent, which makes it just a little better than the S&amp;P 500 index which I can buy from Vanguard. OK, Dalio must be doing something right or he wouldn’t be worth nearly $17 billion, right? Yes, it\\'s true that Dalio built his firm from scratch, and is smart at convincing people to give him their money, but that doesn’t mean his critiques of capitalism and his solutions are all that smart. Dalio is credited with predicting the 2008 financial crisis (he was far from alone on this one). But he also recently gave Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont $100 million to improve public education and fund a bunch of other great stuff like making poor communities a better place to live. Dalio is supposed to be good at numbers, which is why it’s odd that he thinks his $100 million filtered through one of the most wasteful state governments in the country will do much of anything. It’s also odd that Dalio thinks higher taxes are the solution to capitalism’s ills. Dalio told \"60 Minutes\" that people like him (i.e. the rich) should pay more to make the economy more equitable as long as the money is going to something “productive” like education. “Am I saying something that\\'s controversial?,\" he asked correspondent Bill Whitaker, who replied: “It\\'s just strange to hear it come from the mouth of a billionaire.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP It’s also absurd. Government is one of the least productive organizations on the face of the earth. We have a pension crisis, we had a housing crisis, and we have a student-loan debt crisis, not to mention a looming Social Security crisis, lots of debt and a fiscal deficit, because government is big and wasteful and inefficient. And who exactly are the people like Dalio who will be paying even more taxes? Does he mean we need to raise taxes on dudes who have $17 billion in the bank? Or people with just a few million? Try funding the utopia Dalio envisions by taxing billionaires and most will leave the country. Even if they stayed there wouldn’t be enough money to pay for all the education and poverty eradication in Dalio’s utopia. That’s why people who earn around $250,000 a year, not $250 million, get hammered so hard by the tax man: there’s more of them. My guess is that Dalio’s little capitalism bashing media tour is a manifestation of rich, white man’s guilt, and a need for a big liberal media hug as he approaches 70 years on this earth. Now that he got his hug, maybe he can just go away.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'One of the top use cases for Amazon Alexa is its ability to quickly summarize the day’s headlines via its customizable “Flash Briefing” skill. Now, Amazon is rolling out a new feature that will allow Alexa device owners to get more in-depth news from their preferred news provider, with this week’s launch of “long-form news.” Currently, the new feature works with news from Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN, Fox News, Newsy and NPR, Amazon says. Getting the news is already a top voice activity among smart speakers owners. According to a 2018 Adobe survey, 46 percent of voice assistant users ask their smart speaker for news. And today’s Alexa Skill Store lists over 5,000 voice apps in its News category, which indicates some level of consumer demand for this sort of content. But sometimes users want more than just a set of quick headlines. That’s where Alexa’s in-depth news feature aims to help. Amazon says that voice commands like “Alexa, tell me the news,” “Alexa play news,” or “Alexa play news from…” followed by the source’s name, will now launch in-depth news sessions featuring stories curated by the news provider. This can include stories from NPR’s most popular radio shows, CNN’s top headlines, Newsy’s video news, and others. Both Newsy and CNBC will offer video news stories on Alexa devices with a screen, like the Echo Show and Echo Spot. The rest will be audio-only. Customers can listen or watch all the news stories or move through the different stories with verbal commands like “Alexa, next” or “Alexa, skip” to jump ahead. When you ask Alexa for the news for the first time, the assistant will ask for your preferred provider. You’ll also be able to change this later in the same Settings screen where you currently configure your Flash Briefing preferences. This is a little confusing because the section is still labeled Flash Briefing, instead of something more appropriate, like “News” or “News settings,” for example. In addition, the process of using the new feature is a bit different for those customers who have already been using Flash Briefing, which is also confusing. If a Flash Briefing user asks Alexa for the news, the assistant will continue to play the Flash Briefing you’ve already configured and are used to accessing by saying things like “Alexa what’s the news?” or “Alexa, tell me the news,” among other things. If you want to instead now hear the long-form version of the news, you’ll need to specify a source by saying the specific command: “Alexa, play the news from CNN” (or whichever news provider you prefer.) Amazon seems to understand this process is a little clunky, telling us it’s still “early days” for the feature and it will “continue to listen to customer feedback and evolve the experience over time.” The launch is a big bet that smart speaker owners want to do more than stream music, control their smart home, or perform other minor tasks, like setting alarms, timers, or using lists, for instance. Instead, it sees Amazon Alexa, to some extent, taking the place of watching a nightly news telecast. That’s an option that many of today’s cord cutters don’t have, as they’ve given up pay TV for just Netflix or some other mix for streaming apps. Longer-form content could also give Amazon a place to put ad units in the future, if it wanted to go that route. The long-form news feature began rolling out to customers in the U.S. on Monday.'},\n",

Kennedy Airport along with \"viewing parties\" at some of its main hubs around the U.S. on Wednesday afternoon, according to a company invitation obtained by CNBC. A save-the-date email announcing the April 10 event featured a background pattern similar to upholstery on London\\'s subway. Buttons featuring JetBlue\\'s logo and iconic London sights of Big Ben and the London Eye were sent to JetBlue offices, according to one employee. The company\\'s shares jumped by about 4% in after-hours trading on the news. JetBlue may add service to London but its plans could include other routes to European cities from its New York and Boston hubs. JetBlue declined to confirm whether it would make an announcement Wednesday but said in a statement, \"Potential routes to Europe could provide us an opportunity to grow our focus cities of Boston and New York as we consider the best use of our aircraft from a margin perspective in those cities.\" The move would pit the low-cost carrier against large international airlines like Delta, American, United and their European partners who dominate trans-Atlantic travel. A key part of JetBlue\\'s strategy in serving Europe would be its popular Mint business class, which features lie-flat seats and some suites with sliding doors as well as premium meals. \"When we think about trans-Atlantic, we do think we can disrupt largely around a Mint-like product because we\\'ve been so successful on flying to the West Coast with Mint,\" Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue\\'s president and COO said last September. The trans-Atlantic market, \"especially in the premium category, suffers from the same lack of competition and high fares that [transcontinental] routes in the U.S. saw before JetBlue introduced Mint,\" JetBlue\\'s statement said Tuesday. A long-range variant of the Airbus A321 plane would likely be used to help JetBlue fly across the Atlantic and the airline said it would make a decision on that plane this year.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'NEW YORK Bank of America plans to raise its starting pay to $20 an hour over a two-year period, the bank said Tuesday, starting with a hike next month. The company, with more than 200,000 workers, said it is raising its minimum hourly wage to $17 on May 1 and will continue to increase pay until it hits $20 an hour in 2021. Bank of America raised its hourly minimum wage to $15 in 2017. \"If you get a job at Bank of America, you\\'ll make $41,000 per year,\" Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan said during a television interview on MSNBC. The timing of Bank of America\\'s announcement is no coincidence. Moynihan and the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and three other banks will appear in front of a House finance committee Wednesday in the most significant hearing on the banking industry since Democrats took control of the House earlier this year. Banks have been trying to polish up their images ahead of the hearing, well aware they had a record year in profits in 2018 thanks the tax cuts passed by Republicans in 2017. All the meanwhile the banking industry\\'s lobbyists have been pushing Congress to further unwind the rules and regulations put into place after the 2008 financial crisis. Wells Fargo announced last week that CEO Tim Sloan would step down from his position effective immediately. In a call with analysts, Sloan mentioned the political pressure over his leadership of the scandal-plagued bank had become too much. At JPMorgan Chase, CEO Jamie Dimon used his annual letter to shareholders, which is read by people both inside and outside the banking industry, to sell shareholders on the wages and benefit increases JPMorgan had made to employees last year. JPMorgan now pays its workers $15 to $18 an hour, and recently cut the deductible low-wage workers need to pay to access health care as well. \"This is the right thing to do, and we now offer well above the average hourly wage for most markets,\" Dimon said in his letter.'},\n",

Equipment for the factory will come in later, taking several months to be installed, be calibrated, and get up and running. The bottom tweet is a bonus tweet added after the article was published. The tweet confirms the breakneck pace that Tesla’s team in China continues to work at as it speeds along to get its newest factory building cars by the end of this year. Construction of the shell of the new building has been kept the world in a trance, with floods of daily updates from an army of impromptu social media hawks. Truth be told, the shell of the building is one of the least exciting parts of the construction, but it unfortunately, one of the only parts of the construction that we will be able to see. Once the walls go up and the roof is on, we’ll be back in the dark as to progress Tesla is actually making on its new Gigafactory in Shanghai. Presumably, semi truck loads of equipment coming in and out will be the only clues we will have as to the progress towards establishing the new Model 3 production lines. Tesla previously shared that its new Shanghai Gigafactory, which is also known as Gigafactory 3 (behind Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York), will initially produce the Tesla Model 3 at the end of this year. Production of the recently announced Tesla Model Y will follow next year as Tesla works to ramp up production of the launch of the new vehicle, slated for late next year. The Gigafactory 3 update from Musk came in response to a tweet from Tesla hawk and friend of CleanTechnica Vincent, who continues to leverage his Chinese network to keep the world informed about Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 progress and Chinese Tesla sales.

       "   'content': 'Investing.com - The S&amp;P 500 snapped an eight-day winning streak as global growth jitters and concerns about escalating U.S. and EU trade tensions soured sentiment on U.S. stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.72%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.61%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.56%. The EU warned it stands ready to retaliate should the U.S. move ahead with tariffs on $11.2 billion worth of EU goods, raising fears that both nations are on a collision course. Both sides accuse the other of illegally subsidizing their respective aircraft makers, Boeing in the U.S. and Airbus in the EU. The dispute has been tied up in litigation since 2004, but came to the fore last May when the World Trade Organization ruled that Airbus had received illegal government funding for its A380 and A350 models, adversely affecting Boeing\\'s sales. Trade aside, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) came under fire after the aircraft maker said total orders, a measure of future demand, plunged to 95 aircraft in the first quarter from 180 a year earlier. The aircraft maker\\'s much maligned 737 MAX jets saw orders plunge to zero following a worldwide grounding in March. Elsewhere, fears over global growth resurfaced, prompting investors to hold off of risky bets after the IMF cut its global growth outlook, citing Brexit-related uncertainties and U.S.-China trade tensions. The IMF sees global economic growth of 3.3% this year, down from the 3.5% it forecast in January. The broader market was also pegged back by falling energy stocks on the back of slump in oil prices as oversupply fears returned. The EIA lifted its forecast for 2019 and 2020 average U.S. oil production, while Russian President Vladimir Putin poured cold water on expectations for prolonged oil-production cuts, saying current oil prices were suitable for Moscow. In tech, semis stumbled amid fears the rally in the sector so far this year has led frothy valuations in chips stocks. “We downgrade semis to benchmark,” Morgan Stanley wrote in note Monday. \"The sector is now discounting above-trend growth in the U.S. We worry about a lengthening smartphone cycle.\" Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT ) ended the day nursing losses. With just a three days to go until JPMorgan and Wells Fargo kick off the first-quarter earnings season on Friday, investors are seemingly reining in bets on a bullish quarter, with many expecting a tough road ahead. First-quarter earnings are now expected to decline 4.2% year over year for S&amp;P 500 companies, according to FactSet, compared to a 3.9% decline forecast just one week ago. On the economic front, weaker-than-expected U.S. job openings added to the day\\'s gloom. Top S&amp;P 500 Gainers and Losers Today: Cerner (NASDAQ: CERN ), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST ) and Campbell Soup (NYSE: CPB ) were among the top S&amp;P 500 gainers for the session. Pentair (NYSE: PNR ), Under Armour (NYSE: UAA ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) were among the worst S&amp;P 500 performers of the session.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Levi Strauss ( LEVI ) posted a profit for the first quarter after, reporting for the first time since going public last month. X Levi earnings per share came in at 37 cents, swinging from a year-ago loss of 5 cents a share, which saw a transitional impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted net income jumped 81% to $151 million. Wall Streets analysts had not posted estimates for Levi\\'s earnings. Revenue rose 7% to $1.435 billion. In the Americas, net revenue grew 9%, or 10% on a constant-currency basis. In Europe, revenue rose 3%, or 10% on a constant-currency basis. In Asia, revenues climbed 8%, or 14% on a constant-currency basis. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 10%, due to a larger retail network and e-commerce growth. The company sees fiscal-year constant-currency net revenues growth in the mid-single digits. Management also sees full-year capital expenditures of $190 million-$200 million and nearly 100 new company-operated store openings. \"We delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit constant-currency revenue growth,\" said CEO Chip Bergh. \"Growth was broad-based across all three regions and all channels, demonstrating that our strategies are working and our investments are paying off.\" Since 2011, Levi earnings have grown at a compound annual rate of 11.3%, and net income reached $285 million in fiscal 2018. Revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 2.3% and hit $5.6 billion in 2018. The Americas made up 55% of sales, Europe made up 29%; and Asia, including the Mideast and Africa, contributed 16%. Meanwhile, industrywide jeans sales grew 2.2% to $16.7 billion last year after four consecutive years of declines, according to Euromonitor data. Denim also powered strong gains in apparel sales this past holiday season, while market tracker NPD Group has noted signs of slowing in athleisure as jeans and boots rebound. Levi Stock Shares rose 1.7% late after closing up 2.7% at 21.88 in the stock market today. Levi stock hit a high of 24.19 on April 1, but has been struggling to maintain its momentum. It has yet to form an IPO base. Levi stock performed above expectations when it went public, with shares jumping 32% on its first day of trading. Another indication of the demand was the IPO itself was oversubscribed and ended up pricing at $17 a share, above expectations. The Stock Checkup Tool shows Levi stock has mediocre fundamentals, which is why it has an IBD Composite Rating of 46. Levi earnings have been improving, with EPS growing by an average 133% over the past three quarters. However the three-year EPS growth rate is just 4%. In addition to jeans, Levi makes casual and dress pants, tops, shorts, skirts, jackets, footwear and related accessories. Its brands include Dockers, Denizen and Signature. VF Corp. ( VFC ), which plans to spin off its jeans brands, slipped 1.3%. Jeans retailer American Eagle Outfitters ( AEO ) lost 2.5%. IPO Stock On Trend Baird analyst Matt Tingler said denim could be coming back into fashion at an opportune time for Levi stock. \"Levi\\'s IPO shows that the denim category is in favor with investors and not dead as many believe. Denim has been under attack by athleisure clothing as consumers, particularly women, have transitioned their clothing away from denim,\" he said last month. \"There are signs, however, that denim is beginning to experience a resurgence, coincidentally, at the cost of athleisure clothing.\" Tingler also said there are good opportunities for the IPO stock if it can harness its brand in the lucrative Asian market. A strong presence there would boost Levi earnings. He also pointed out that strong performance for Levi could bode well for other established names that have fallen out of favor. \"A resurgence in Levi\\'s will also be an indication of consumers interest in heritage brands. Levi\\'s, much like Champion, which has seen exceptionally strong growth, had fallen out of favor for newer, more modern brands like Paige, Citizens for Humanity, Fidelity and other denim brands over recent years,\" he said.

       "   'content': 'China is home to the vast majority of cryptocurrency miners, as the country is privy to extremely low energy costs compared to the rest of the world. But as Bitcoin pric e finds new life, lawmakers in the country are considering banning crypto mining among 450 other activities that are deemed to be unsafe, wasteful of natural resources, or pollute the environment. The news is largely viewed as FUD in the crypto community, who have become accustomed to China threatening crypto in the past. Others believe that the news is actually bullish for Bitcoin, and could help the first every cryptocurrency become more decentralized. Crypto Community Sounds Off On China Bitcoin Mining Ban South China Morning Post reports that the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has revealed a draft list of industrial activities the government is interested in restricting or outright banning, which include cryptocurrency mining. Related Reading | Crypto Analyst: Higher High In Bitcoin Price Confirms Bear Market Bottom Is In Due to China dominating the Bitcoin mining industry, both in terms of the actual mining of BTC, as well as manufacturing the rigs that support the activity elsewhere, the entire crypto industry was up in arms this morning following the breaking news. Of course, China fears bring out the trolls. Let\\'s be clear: China banning PoW mining doesn\\'t mean they are banning rig manufacture. It doesn\\'t mean the end of Bitcoin. You\\'d think that maximalist trolls would have higher confidence and thicker skin. — Emin Gün Sirer (@el33th4xor) April 9, 2019 Cornell University professor and founder of Ava Labs Emin Gun Sirer took to Twitter to dispel the FUD, and clear up any confusion over what it means for Bitcoin. As he points out, manufacturing mining rigs wont end, and the news certainly doesnt mean the end of Bitcoin. Other crypto analysts and investors, simply shrugged off the news. \"China says it wants to eliminate bitcoin mining\" #Bitcoin Fud pic.twitter.com/t11kNWD695 — WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) April 9, 2019 China has repeatedly flip-flopped its position on cryptocurrencies, but overall hasnt been welcoming to the new financial technology and emerging asset class. What Does the China Mining Ban Mean for Bitcoin Price? Sirer suggests that previous China FUD has resulted in bullish price action in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but calls the effects of the recent news pretty weak. Historically, news of this kind (aka \"China FUD\") has been correlated with price upticks. Though as far as consumer-affecting FUD goes, this is pretty weak. The impact is on miners, not regular users. — Emin Gün Sirer (@el33th4xor) April 9, 2019 BTC has continued to range below resistance at $5,300 after a nearly $1,000 rally early last week, that began once Bitcoin broke $4,200. The price has remained mostly stable despite the largest source of BTC mining potentially being barred from the activity. Related Reading | Bitcoin Price Surged More In 1 Hour Than Last Two Months Combined Regardless of the lack of price action in response to the news, there are still many positive implications for Bitcoin that could stem from such a ban. Bullish for 2 reasons: 1- higher costs elsewhere 2- more decentralization — Der_Kil (@ilk_erd) April 9, 2019 With China no longer able to dominate Bitcoin mining, the network will become more decentralized and therefore safer in general. In the past, China was said to have the means and potentially the motive, to destroy Bitcoin. The motive may remain, but the means will be greatly diminished should the NDRC proceed with their proposed amendments.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'JPMorgan Chase ( JPM -0.9% ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC -1.5% ) will start off Q1 earnings season on Friday, giving an early view of how the year is shaping up. To be sure, Q1 will be a bit complicated for banks--the government shutdown depressed IPO activity in January, the stock market rebounded from December\\'s drop, and the Fed\\'s last rate hike in December likely marks a peak in interest rates. Analysts and investors will watch trading revenue carefully after a brutal Q4. For Q1, market volatility and the government shutdown led to a \" sluggish environment for trading and investment banking,\" Buckingham Group analyst James Mitchell wrote in a note. Trading revenue at the biggest banks is expected to drop 14%, says RBC Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy. Commercial and industrial lending growth will help larger banks, according to Raymond James analyst David Long. Consumer banking was strong in Q4 for most banks, and may continue as well for this quarter. Analysts expect JPMorgan\\'s Q1 EPS to rise 4.0% Y/Y while Wells Fargo\\'s is expected to fall 1.3%, according to consensus estimates. As earnings season approaches, the outlook becomes more muted. In the past month, the consensus estimate for JPMorgan\\'s Q1 EPS slipped 1.1%. The consensus for Wells Fargo declined only 0.2% over the same period, but it already started out with a dimmer view.

       "   'content': 'Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to publicly endorse Herman Cain for the Federal Reserve Board after signaling last week that the former pizza chain executive and 2012 Republican presidential candidate would struggle to get through the GOP-led Senate. President Trump has said he wants to nominate Cain to the nations central bank, as well as conservative economist Stephen Moore, which would give him two allies on the Feds board to stake out the presidents interests. McConnell (R-Ky.) punted Tuesday when asked by reporters whether he would support the nominations of Cain and Moore. Well, were going to look at whoever he sends up, and once he does, well take a look at it, McConnell told reporters. McConnells noncommittal stance on Trumps preferred picks, neither of whom have been officially nominated yet, suggests at minimum serious trepidation among Senate leadership that these men are worthy of consideration for such crucial financial roles. Republicans have privately expressed concern that selecting ideological partisans to the board risks politicizing the Fed, which is designed to be an independent governing body. Also, neither man is particularly well-versed in monetary policy. Additionally, Cain is tarred by sexual misconduct allegations that all but ended his presidential campaign in 2012. If Cain is nominated by Trump, that history would be a focal point of his confirmation hearings. Cain has denied the accusations, but it is a very different political climate than the one he ran in seven years ago. In a post-Me Too era, Republicans will not be eager to bring up a Trump-backed nominee who will face scrutiny over his treatment of women. Top Senate Republicans, including McConnell and Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), have privately encouraged GOP senators to proactively relay their concerns to the White House if they hear about a potential nominee who would run into confirmation troubles in the Senate. I think itd be really good if they consult ahead of time and find out. There are some names out there that arent confirmable. And we would tell them that, if asked, Thune said Tuesday. It certainly isnt to their advantage to send somebody up here thats not gonna be able to be confirmed. Erica Werner contributed to this report.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Evenity (romosozumab-aqqg) to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of breaking a bone (fracture). These are women with a history of osteoporotic fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture, or those who have failed or are intolerant to other osteoporosis therapies. More than 10 million people in the U.S. have osteoporosis, which is most common in women who have gone through menopause. People with osteoporosis have weakened bones that are more likely to fracture. “Today’s approval provides women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture with a new treatment that will reduce this risk,” said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D, M.M.Sc., director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products. “But Evenity may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death so it’s important to carefully select patients for this therapy, which includes avoiding use in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year.” Evenity is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the protein sclerostin and works mainly by increasing new bone formation. One dose of Evenity consists of two injections, one immediately following the other, given once a month by a health care professional. The bone forming effect of Evenity wanes after 12 doses so more than 12 doses should not be used. If osteoporosis therapy is needed after the 12 doses, patients should begin an osteoporosis treatment that reduces bone breakdown. The safety and efficacy of Evenity were demonstrated in two clinical trials involving a total of more than 11,000 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. In the first trial, one year of treatment with Evenity lowered the risk of a new fracture in the spine (vertebral fracture) by 73% compared to placebo. This benefit was maintained over the second year of the trial when Evenity was followed by one year of denosumab (another osteoporosis therapy) compared to placebo followed by denosumab. In the second trial, one year of treatment with Evenity followed by one year of alendronate (another osteoporosis therapy) reduced the risk of a new vertebral fracture by 50% compared to two years of alendronate alone. Evenity followed by alendronate also reduced the risk of fractures in other bones (nonvertebral fractures) compared to alendronate alone. Evenity increased the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in the alendronate trial, but not in the placebo trial. Therefore, Evenity contains a boxed warning on its labeling stating that it may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death and should not be used in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year. Health care professionals should also consider whether the benefits of Evenity outweigh its risks in those with other risk factors for heart disease and should discontinue Evenity in any patient who experiences a heart attack or stroke during treatment. Common side effects of Evenity included joint pain and headache. Injection site reactions were also observed. The FDA granted the approval of Evenity to Amgen. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency is also responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. ###'},\n",

In a bid to save on labor costs, its betting on robots to clean floors, sort inventory, and replenish out-of-stock items in its stores, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Walmart has several jobs in mind for the new robots. Robot floor cleaners are coming to 1,500 stores. (The company says that floor scrubbing was previously a task that could take a human worker two to three hours each day to complete.) Walmart is also adding 600 conveyor belts that can sort inventory automatically, and at least 300 bots that can check if shelves are running out of stock after Walmart initially began to test this technology in 2017. All of this is coming at the cost of human labor. The more robots Walmart hires, the fewer people it needs for each task, and the more money it saves across its 4,600 stores in the US. Walmart says that although its cutting down on labor for tasks like flooring cleaning, it is hiring employees to focus on growing its online grocery business. The move also comes after retail companies like Target and Walmart announced slight wage increases for store workers. Walmart appears to be trying to make its online grocery service competitive to AmazonFresh and Amazon Prime Nows Whole Foods delivery, both of which are still expanding. Its part of a long feud between the two retail giants. While the brick-and-mortar Walmart has been pushed to acquire Jet.com and establish more of an online presence, Amazon has added physical stores to its e-commerce offerings and began to follow the playbooks of more traditional brands. Just last week, Amazon announced a new round of price cuts at Whole Foods stores around greens and tropical fruits. The company also reportedly has plans to expand grocery stores in major US cities later this year.'},\n",

WHY IT MATTERS Starboard owns 1.2 percent of Cerner stock, putting it in the top 20 among shareholders, according to Blooomberg. The firm nominated two of the four new Cerner board members: Melinda Mount and George Riedel. Mount, previously president of wearables company Jawbone, has worked at Microsoft, Time Warner, AOL and Morgan Stanley while Reidel served as CEO of CloudMark and has a background in telecommunications at Nortel and Juniper.

Now there are only three. Last year, there were 60 kinds of K\\x92Nex construction sets on the market. This year there are 20. DENNIS ODA / SEPT. 28, 2010 Shoppers arrive at the Toys R Us store in Aiea in 2010. A slew of retailers like Walmart, Target and Party City rushed to expand their toy aisles to capitalize on the demise of the Toys R Us chain. NEW YORK &gt;&gt; Just last year, a kid in the market for an Uncle Milton ant farm could choose from a half dozen versions, including glow-in-the-dark or an ant village. Now there are only three. Last year, there were 60 kinds of K’Nex construction sets on the market. This year there are 20. A year after Toys R Us imploded, toy makers are still readjusting to the big loss of shelf space. That means slashing the number of styles they carry, re-evaluating how they sell large toys like playhouses and cars, and changing their packaging to squeeze into smaller retail spaces. It’s a jolt for toy companies. They had already been trying to reinvent themselves amid an onslaught of changes, including kids’ evolving tastes toward gadgets, as well as the rise of Amazon and online shopping. They never expected the iconic chain to liquidate its 800 U.S. stores six months after it filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 2017. Some companies depended on the chain for as much as 40 percent of overall sales. A slew of retailers like Walmart, Target and Party City rushed to expand their toy aisles to capitalize on Toys R Us’s demise, but toy companies say they aren’t able to fill the void. The stores devoted big sections to toys year round and served as incubators of new trends. They also say that Toys R Us’ massive orders of tens of thousands of units offset the cost of production. All this has led to fewer options for kids. “Maybe the world only needs one kind of ant farm, but in the day, you had a choice,” said Jay Foreman, president and CEO of Basic Fun. The Boca Raton, Florida-based company purchased the assets of Uncle Milton, which makes ant farms, along with K’Nex and Playhut, over the past year. He is now evaluating his overall lineup. Many parents have taken note of the more limited options. Stephen Desch of Keyport, N.J., said when his now 3-year-old daughter wanted a crab-shaped sandbox, he found it at Toys R Us. But he can’t find certain items now, like a plush toy inspired by the Jay character from the Netflix show “Beat Bugs.” “It’s definitely annoying,” Desch said. Vanessa Myers of Bristol, Virginia, cites too many choices in some categories, like light up toys for the tub. But she does worry about the dwindling selection of dolls and bikes. “I really want dolls that are diverse,” in hair color and ethnicity, she said. Toys R Us collapsed after racking up nearly $3 billion in revenue last year, or 12 percent of the U.S. toy market, according to market research group NPD Group Inc. Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of TTPM, an online toy review site, estimates that 40 percent of Toys R Us business wasn’t scooped up. Even as the former investors of Toys R Us try to resurrect the business in the U.S. in time for the holidays, many expect it to be a shell of what it was. The effort follows a 2 percent drop to $21.6 billion in toy sales for last year, with demand weakening during the second half of the year with the loss of Toys R Us. That reversed four straight years of sales growth, NPD says. Mattel’s annual sales last year fell 8 percent, reflecting a negative 6 percent impact from the toy retailer’s liquidation. At Hasbro, annual sales dropped 12 percent, dragged down by the loss of Toys R Us. Mattel had been struggling for several years, but it had been starting to see a turnaround. Toy makers have been expanding online, but that isn’t the panacea, says Marc Rosenberg, the strategic marketing adviser who was behind the success of Hasbro’s furry hit Furby. Physical stores still drive the toy business and profitability since companies don’t incur shipping costs, Rosenberg says. Foreman agrees, saying his new line of Cutetitos — beanie babies wrapped up in a burrito blanket and launched for the holidays — would have fared even better if Toys R Us was around. Typically, Toys R Us would have devoted a 3-feet-by-16-inch display in a highly visible spot to a hot item. Instead, stores gave Cutetitos an area that measured 18 inches wide by 5 inches deep. Isaac Larian, CEO of privately held MGA Entertainment, has seen overall sales triple last year because of its popular LOL toys. But its Little Tikes division, which makes toy cars and playhouses that need big areas for display, suffered a 12 percent sales drop because of the loss of Toys R Us even as his business with Amazon rose 50 percent. Overall, 27 percent of its overall business stemmed from Toys R Us, but at Little Tikes, that figure was 40 percent. Larian’s Little Tikes toy factory — the largest U.S. toy factory — based in Hudson, Ohio, is running at 25 percent capacity. Larian says he’s cutting the number of Little Tikes toys it produces mainly because of the loss of Toys R Us. He’s now expanding into housewares to keep the factory busier. “Every day we are reinventing ourselves,” he said.'},\n",

The company sees this as a way to enhance its artificial intelligence and machine learning expertise in general, while giving it a much stronger market placement in France in particular and the EU in general. As the company stated, there are some hurdles before the deal becomes official. “The acquisition requires prior consultation with the relevant works councils and would be subject to customary closing conditions,” Accenture indicated in a statement. Should all that come to pass, then Cirruseo will become part of Accenture.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'It\\'s been two years since Dr. David Dao, a pulmonologist from Vietnam, was the subject of an internationally infamous viral video. United Airlines eventually settled with Dao for an undisclosed sum after the incident sparked outcry from consumers around the world and even reached as high as the federal government. Daniel Elwell, the Federal Aviation Administration\\'s acting administrator, also poked fun at the settlement. On Tuesday, the second anniversary of the doctor\\'s forced removal from United Flight 3411 by Chicago air-safety officers, Dao gave his first interview about what happened that spring day with ABC\\'s \"Good Morning America.\" He doesn\\'t remember much of the incident after he hit his head on the plane\\'s bulkhead and suffered a concussion, he told the morning show. But after watching the video of the incident, he said, \"I just cried.\" \"I had to hide,\" Dao said of his unwanted fame. \"I stayed for months and months in the house.\" The two officers who dragged Dao by his limbs down the plane\\'s aisle as alarmed passengers looked on were eventually fired from the Chicago Department of Aviation, but Dao said he isn\\'t angry with them. \"They have a job to do,\" Dao said. \"If they don\\'t do it they might lose their job, so I\\'m not angry with them.\" No United Airlines employees were fired because of the incident, though the company did eventually change its policies for crew booking and compensated all passengers on the flight. In a statement to ABC, the airline said, \"Flight 3411 was a defining moment for United Airlines and it is our responsibility to make sure we as a company continue to learn from that experience.\" Dao, for his part, is glad the situation eventually led to change at United. \"The most important thing is that accident turned out in a positive way,\" he said.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"LOS ANGELESWhat are you doing with the kids for summer? Sure, it's only April and Spring Break hasn't even sprung for some, but that's the question most parents I know are buzzing about. Some even start the summer talk back as far as the end of winter break. As for what I do, I usually start planning from the summer before. Sound a little crazy? Well, with two kids, summer camp out here can cost no kidding up to about $10,000. That figure causes me to start to hyperventilate just a little if I think about it too much. Frankly, my family doesn't have that kind of money sitting around waiting to be spent. For my family, even thinking of spending that kind of money takes planning. And even then, so many of us can't, no matter how much planning, spend that kind of money. Many parents work hard to figure out fun and fulfilling summer activities that beat summer slide but also don't break the bank. Children in a summer class in Kennett Square, Pa., on July 21, 2014. (Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) So it becomes a game of finding early bird discounts here, coupons there, free and low-fee camps and incentives for spreading the word. Maybe bidding on school auction camp discounts can help or planning at Open Enrollment in the fall how much money we can afford to squirrel away in Dependent Care accounts to get reimbursed for summer dollars spent. The whole summer scramble to figure out camp and how to afford it is the topic of many conversations, texts and social media exchanges. So we want to create a conversation here.

Since it first launched, the micromobility company has charged $1 to unlock an electric scooter, plus 15 cents per minute of riding. Now, Bird is effectively doubling that per-minute fee in some cities, while lowering it in others. Similar to ride-hailing, big macs, and cups of coffee, our pricing now varies by city Bird wouldnt provide a full list of which markets would experience price fluctuations, but local media outlets and scooter watchers on Twitter have some of the details. Per-minute fees increased to 25 cents in cities like Austin, Texas and Los Angeles, to 29 cents in Baltimore, and to 33 cents in Detroit and Charlotte, NC. Some cities are getting price decreases to 10 cents / minute, like Bloomington, IL, Charlottesville, NC, and Columbia, MO. Similar to ride-hailing, big macs, and cups of coffee, our pricing now varies by city, the spokesperson said in an email. The price for our environmentally friendly scooters has been updated to range from 10 cents to 33 cents per minute. Bird doubled its per minute rates for scooter rides around the country from $0.15 per minute to $0.25-0.35 33 in Detroit, 29 in Baltimore, 25 in Austin &amp; LA So the service either loses money or costs a ton ($3.90 a mile, for an 11.3 minute, 1 mile trip Austin average). Or both pic.twitter.com/Qsj3l7uoVp Asher (@AsherDeMontreal) April 9, 2019 Some cities are requiring the scooter companies to pay large upfront fees to account for the costs of enforcement. Baltimore charged Bird and Lime each a $15,000 fee up front and a $1 per scooter fee per day. In Raleigh, North Carolina, Bird added a $2 transportation fee on top of its $1 unlock fee after the City Council implemented a $300 per scooter fee. Bird says it is making the price changes transparent to riders prior to them initiating a ride. When riders open the app, theyll see a message about updated pricing information and will be asked to acknowledge the change to unlock a scooter. The price updates come as scooters begin to return to some cities in force after disappearing for the winter. And the scooter sharing companies are beginning to roll out more durable, longer-lasting versions of their scooters that are supposed to improve their ability to stay in service longer. Those scooters are more expensive to manufacture and operate, though, which necessitates some price adjustment for consumers. The unit economics of the scooter-sharing business is overall pretty terrible. Quartz crunched the numbers from Louisville, Kentucky, and found the average lifespan of a scooter was only 28.8 days, doing an average of three and a half rides per day. At these rates, Bird only recoups $67 on the cost of the average scooter in other words, it loses a whopping $293 per scooter. And thats not even factoring a host of other costs, like taxes and fees. Bird disputes these numbers. Other scooter companies are likely to raise their prices in response to Bird, though the major ride-hailing companies that also operate scooters, like Uber and Lyft, can probably afford to delay those changes in order to poach riders from Bird and Lime.'},\n",

This comes one day after the image-sharing social network set a price range of $15 to $17 per share for its initial public offering of 75 million shares.

Pinterest\\'s price range is seen as a discount from the company\\'s most recent valuation on the private markets, which was $12 billion in its last fundraising round in 2017. The upper end of the target range will put Pinterest at just $11.3 billion. The social network\\'s public offering follows ride-hailing start-up Lyft \\'s debut less than two weeks ago. It was not smooth sailing for Lyft as its shares went downhill after the initial pop and are still trading below the IPO price.

       "   'content': 'PG&amp;E Corp. stocks downward slide has continued this year, and while the dust may be beginning to clear on where the utility stands in terms of recent wildfires, Morgan Stanley warns that potential liabilities for future outbreaks are the next worry for shareholders. The back story. PG&amp;E is down 20% this year and has tumbled nearly 58% in the past 12 months. Claims against the utility in connection with Californias 2017-2018 seriesof deadly wildfires have forced it to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The outlook for the stock isnt as dire as it once was, and the shares got a boost on the appointment of a new CEO last week (as activists clamored for leadership changes ). Yet the company had to suspend its dividend, critics remain, and Barrons has warned of the risks of trading PG&amp;E. One of the biggest reason not to own the stock is uncertainty about what future wildfires may bring. While a wet winter may help to prevent a repeat of last years disaster, wildfires are unlikely to disappear from the California landscape, and lawmakers may not be eager to help utilities pass on the costs of future incidents beyond current legislation. In addition, the state has an inverse condemnation law, which means that companies can be on the hook for fires started by their equipment, even if they arent found to be negligent. That is less of a concern for PG&amp;E at the moment because it has been established that its equipment didnt cause the 2017 Tubbs Fire, but it could be a problem in the future. Whats new. On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley s Stephen Byrd took a look at how the liability question could affect both PG&amp;E and Edison International (EIX). He examined options that California could take in regard to future fireseverything from stress tests to an insurance fund, built up via surcharges utilities could charge customers, that could cover fire-related costs in cases where a utility isnt found to be negligent. Late last week, the California Public Utilities Commission proposed a version of a stress test that would examine utilitiess ability to weather a heavy financial blow. Byrd notes that the investor response has been largely positive. The plan seeks to make sure utilities can help pay for fire damage without having their debt downgraded to junk, making it harder for them to raise funds. Looking Ahead. Byrd believes that a stress test could soothe some investors nerves. If the test made clear the amount of new debt a utility could have to take out in the event of a fire, shareholders could just deduct that risk from the utilities earnings, arriving at a discounted multiple for the shares. Yet all this is conjecture at the moment. A legislative blueprint is due out from the governors office later this week Byrd says he thinks the plan will include a very large statewide insurance fund, which investors would probably like. With a fund potentially large enough to cover wildfire damages of up to $75 billion the market may be somewhat comforted by such a large amount of protection from future damages, he wrote. The analyst reiterated an Equal Weight rating and $17.50 price target on PG&amp;E, writing that even a large insurance fund would, on its own, be insufficient to incentivize institutional investors to provide badly needed capital to PG&amp;E in the future. PG&amp;E was down 3.5% to $18.99 near midday. Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com'},\n",

On the political side, the bond sale shows that investors will not be detracted by the Khashoggi killing, he said. Just six months ago, the conventional wisdom was that the incident left Saudi Arabia with little political capital and the kingdom would have to keep oil prices low to appease the Trump administration, Bradley noted. Instead, Saudi Arabia has slashed its output this year, helping to boost benchmark oil prices by 30-40% this year and reassuring investors of its influence over the market. The public disclosures in the bond prospectus have also put to bed some \"nagging questions,\" removing an element of uncertainty. \"I personally think the public disclosures make the IPO much easier to float because a lot of info has been revealed which will help in the range of pricing when the deal is floated,\" Bradley said in an email. \"Bottom-line, the massively oversubscribed Aramco bond deal (way exceeded the most wild expectations) bodes well for the success of an eventual Aramco equity IPO.\"'},\n",

Known for its ice cream and family-friendly restaurants, Massachusetts -based Friendly’s decided to close 23 more locations in the Northeast in an effort to recover from bankruptcy and reposition the brand in today’s competitive market, The Boston Globe and Mass Live reported. Fourteen restaurant locations in upstate New York, three in Massachusetts, three in Connecticut, two in New Hampshire and one in Maine will be shut down. Friendly’s will hold 77 corporate-owned locations and 97 franchised-owned restaurants following these closures. HÄAGEN-DAZS DEBUTING 'SPIRIT-INFUSED' ICE CREAMS DESIGNED TO PAIR WITH YOUR FAVORITE BOOZE “After a months-long evaluation and careful consideration, we have decided to close 23 corporate-owned restaurants, effective immediately,’’ CEO George Michel said in a letter to franchisees Monday, according to WNBF-TV. “While this was a tough decision, we are confident it will best position the brand for a bright future.’’ Friendly’s filed for bankruptcy in 2011. When it emerged from bankruptcy the following year, the company held 254 locations around the country and has been steadily closing up shop since then. Friendly’s has been working to revamp its menu and has been rolling out new services, including catering options and delivery service through DoorDash and Uber Eats. “While there’s much work ahead, we are encouraged by the momentum we’re generating,” Michel reportedly wrote. “The energy and enthusiasm for the plans we unveiled at our February meeting was both gratifying and inspiring, as we seek to re-energize our marketing efforts with the addition of a new agency roster, refresh our menu, focus on delivery and catering options, and improve the overall restaurant experience for our customers.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In 2016, the owner of Friendly’s, Sun Capital, sold the ice cream manufacturing and supermarket sales sides of the business to Dean Foods Co. for $155 million.

Prestley and Curtis Blake, who operated a single storefront in Springfield, Massachusetts. When Hershey Foods sold the chain in 1988, Friendly’s had 850 locations in 15 states.\"},\n",

All of this and more in The Morning Shift for Tuesday, April 9, 2019. 1st Gear: Carlos Ghosn Says Hes the Victim Here Former Renault CEO and Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was originally arrested over allegations of financial misconduct from Nissan in November and has been arrested multiple times since, released a video statement on Tuesday in regards to the allegations against him. The claims against Ghosn have built since the original arrest, and include allegations of underreporting $90 million in compensation and putting personal financial losses on Nissan. He might have even had Renault pay $57,000 toward his wedding, according to reports from earlier this year. The Tuesday statement was on video and not in person, Ghosn said, because he couldnt make the press conference he scheduled. Ghosn was arrested for the fourth time last week, the BBC reports. If you are listening to me through this video today, it means that I was not able to make the press conference that I planned for April 11, Ghosn starts the video with, in an opening clip very reminiscent of the typical If youre reading this, theyve got me movie scene. Ghosn went on to say hes innocent of all charges and all accusations around the charges, and that theyre biased, taken out of context and twisted. He then goes through some of the charges, and says he still has an untainted love for both Japan and Nissan. The third point I want to tell you is that this is a conspiracy, Ghosn said. This is not about specific events. This is not about, again, greed, this is not about dictatorship. This is about a plot. This is about conspiracy. This is about backstabbing. Ghosn said the reasons for this were fear over the next steps in the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, and how further integrating with Renault could threaten certain peopleexecutives, he clarifiedand the autonomy of Nissan as a company. His biggest wish, he said, is to have a fair trial. The full YouTube video wont embed, but can be seen here. 2nd Gear: Carlos Ghosn Voted Out as Nissan Director Reuters reports that Carlos Ghosns last tie with Nissan is now cut, after Nissan shareholders voted him out as a director on Monday. Ghosn was voted out a few days after his most recent arrest in Tokyo, according to Reuters. The allegations of financial misconduct against Ghosn and the aftermath they could cause led to an interesting first shareholder meeting since his first arrest, according to Reuters descriptionsincluding a near record 4,100 shareholders in attendance and the occasional interruption from hecklers. In the meeting, the shareholders voted to remove both Ghosn and Greg Kelly, who was also accused of reporting compensation numbers that were less than the actual amount, from Nissans board of directors. Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard was voted in. From the story: [S]hareholders gathered for an extraordinary meeting, expressing bafflement and disquiet about growing allegations of financial misconduct laid out before them - while seeking more clarity on how Nissan plans to recover from the scandal. Meeting shareholders for the first time since Ghosns initial arrest in November, Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa and Jean-Dominique Senard, the chairman of its alliance partner Renault, said they needed to focus on collaboration and improving governance at the Japanese company. But they offered few concrete details about the way forward. Reuters reports that both Kelly and Ghosn have denied the accusations, and that Ghosn said hes the victim of a boardroom coupas you might already know. 3rd Gear: Tesla Cuts Dozens of Sales Staff Tesla might not be fully going online, laying people off and closing its stores, but Bloomberg reports that a few dozen sales staff did get cut on Thursday. The story said the company cut staff in Chicago, New York and Florida, citing people familiar with the matter. The cuts from Thursday were on people known as inside sales, Bloomberg reports, which is the job of reaching out to potential customers and inviting them on test drives. From the story: After the retail strategy revamp, these employees were reassigned to tasks such as taking inbound calls, helping with deliveries and even washing and detailing vehicles, the people said. Tesla still has operations at the three locations, including employees who can field customer questions and support car owners, according to the company. It still has inside sales teams in Fremont, California, and Las Vegas, the people said. One impacted employee in Tampa, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that 20 inside sales advisers and two managers were informed around noon Thursday that their positions there were being eliminated. Another employee who worked in Brooklyn said the team there was also informed Thursday. Both said the teams were informed of the terminations via conference call and that it was effective immediately. Bloomberg reports that Tesla confirmed the cuts but declined to talk about specifics, including the number of people involved. 4th Gear: Fiat Chrysler Pays $110 Million in Investor Lawsuit Over Emissions Fiat Chrysler will pay $110 million to settle a lawsuit from investors claiming the company misled them over all of those cheating diesel emissions, Reuters reports, citing court records. Investors sued in 2015, according to Reuters. In a statement on Monday, the company said it continues to vigorously deny the allegations of wrongdoing made in this lawsuit and said the settlement is covered by the companys insurance. In 2015, Fiat Chrysler settled allegations with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it failed to properly complete 23 recalls affecting more than 11 million vehicles. It paid a $105 million U.S. penalty, conducted additional recalls and agreed to buy back hundreds of thousands of vehicles. The securities suit also raised claims Fiat Chrysler misled investors over the Justice Departments allegations it used defeat devices to allow diesel-powered vehicles to emit excess emissions. In January, Fiat Chrysler agreed to an $800 million settlement to resolve claims by the U.S. Justice Department and the state of California that it used illegal software to produce false results on diesel-emissions tests. The lawsuit covers investors who bought Fiat Chrysler stock on a U.S. exchange between Oct. 13, 2014 and May 23, 2017. Lawyers for the investors estimated in a court filing that the settlement is equal to 13.8 percent of maximum damages, calling it an objectively excellent result when compared to historical statistics in class action settlements. The settlement still has to be approved by a federal judge in New York, Reuters reports. 5th Gear: Elons Tweets Elon Musk just kind of, well, tweets, even when he shouldnt or when hes not really supposed to. And if you ever wanted to think more about Musks tweets than you already dowhich, honestly, is not recommended Bloomberg analyzed his Twitter habits. Heres the main idea, via Bloomberg: When Elon Musk was accused earlier this year of violating a months-old agreement that he clear material tweets about Tesla Inc. with a company lawyer, the billionaire told a federal judge he took his accord with the Securities and Exchange Commission seriously, and that he had dramatically reduced his postings about the electric-car maker. Then, he went back on a binge. Musk sent more Tesla-related tweets in March than any month since June, according to a Bloomberg News analysis of his activity on the social network. He began the month trying to placate customers irritated by price changes for Autopilot, Teslas driver-assistance system, and ended it with posts about the Semi truck hes eager for Tesla to start producing. The full story, and its analysis of Musks tweets, is here, should you dare. Reverse: Mark Twain Gets His Steamboat Pilots License Samuel Langhorne Clemens got his steamboat pilots license on April 9, 1859, according to History. Here was the deal: Clemens had signed on as a pilots apprentice in 1857 while on his way to Mississippi. He had been commissioned to write a series of comic travel letters for the Keokuk Daily Post, but after writing five, decided hed rather be a pilot than a writer. He piloted his own boats for two years, until the Civil War halted steamboat traffic. According to History, he picked up the term Mark Twain while a pilot, and when he returned to writing, began writing under that name. Neutral: Did Carlos Ghosn Convince You?

       "   'content': 'Monday, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analyst Stephen Tusa downgraded his future picture of the performance of the stock of General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE ). GE stock closed Monday at $9.49, down 5.2 percent from Friday. The low for the day, $9.15, down 8.6 percent. It should be noted that four months earlier Mr. Tusa had upgraded the stock, even though he had promoted a bearish view of the stock for a long time. Lot a lot of people, Mr. Tusa was modestly supportive of Larry Culp, the new GE chief executive officer, soon after he ascended into the top position at the company. Mt. Tusa\\'s comment on the change: \"We believe many investors are underestimating the severity of the challenges and underlying risks at GE, while overestimating the value of small positives.\" This comment represents the unease I have felt about Mr. Culp\\'s accession and the treatment of the task that was facing him. Mr. Culp has an outstanding resume. He seems to be a very intelligent and cohesive as a CEO. And, yet, something has been missing. Mr. Culp\\'s comments and presentations, in my mind, have been less than adequate for the period in which he must establish himself as the firm and confident leader one would want in this position at this time. His view of the future, to me, has been tepid and incomplete. It does not make one want to jump at the chance to be a part of the turnaround. At the top of Mr. Tusa\\'s list of concerns are the cash flow projections that analysts have been working with. Mr. Tusa \"sees Wall Street over-projecting GE\\'s cash flow in coming years with GE Capital needing more cash to cover ongoing problems in that financial-services division.\" Note that GE has warned the market that cash flow will be negative for 2019. However, Mr. Tusa appears to be adamant that cash flow levels are still being over estimated for the near future. Furthermore, GE has more than $100 billion in debt is a large exposure that will have to be faced, even if the economy does not \"sour.\" If these \"liquidity issues\" become a real issue to the company, especially if there is some kind of a recession, GE may be faced into \"a potentially dilutive sale of the rest of Healthcare.\" Putting forth these views had an important impact on the market, as I reported earlier in this post, and there is good reason for this according to Thomas Gryta of the Wall Street Journal, in the article cited above. Mr. Gryta writes, \"The analyst, Stephen Tusa, has been one of GE\\'s biggest skeptics and his investment calls have had outsize influence on GE\\'s shares.\" \"In December, Mr. Tusa upgraded GE but he kept much of his negative tone and his $6 price target even as the stock has rallied to above $10 under new Chief Executive Larry Culp.\" \"On Monday, Mr. Tusa lowered his rating to \"underweight\" and reduced his price target to $5 a share.\" Mr. Tusa has been negative on GE for quite some time now. He initially downgraded the company in May 2016, even before it was obvious that GE was facing some major financial problems. He was the first from a major firm to take this stance. Since then his concerns with the GE situation have been seen to be \"spot on.\" The title of this post is \"General Electric Can\\'t Catch A Break.\" Although not everything that has happened in recent months is GE\\'s fault, or Mr. Culp\\'s fault. General Electric is a large complex company. However, I cannot absent them from a substantial part of the string of unfortunate events that keep happening to them. This is where openness and full disclosure come into play. Part of the reason for the decline in General Electric was the failure of the company to be completely open and transparent to investors. Added to this is the fact that the Board of Directors allowed this hiddenness and opaqueness to go on far too long. They did little to uncover the situation or fulfill their responsibility for oversight of the CEO and senior management. The board must now become much more active and show that it is now willing and able to perform its function more completely. I have written another post on a very similar issue: \" Wells Fargo: A Case for Reconstructing the Role of Boards of Directors.\" Furthermore, the CEO, Mr. Culp, has a responsibility for presenting as full and as clear a picture of what he is doing and what he sees coming at GE in the future. In the three turnarounds that I (successfully) completed, I felt, if anything, that it was my responsibility to provide shareholdersand the marketmore information than they wanted. The reason for this is that, given the difficulty that goes with a turnaround, it is imperative for the owners and the investment community, to have every bit of information they might ever want. I wanted to err on the side of providing too much information, rather than too little. The problem now is that we are in the sixth month of Mr. Culp\\'s reign and it is my feeling that the questions and concerns that are being raised are not the ones that should be being raised. Something is missing and I am afraid that its absence is hurting Mr. Culp and will continue to hurt him in the near future. General Electric can\\'t seem to catch a break, but, they only seem to have themselves to blame.

       "   'content': 'Bitcoin (BTC) has run its course trading within an ascending triangle and will now have to break out. Needless to say, the majority of the crypto community expects the price to break above this ascending triangle. A lot of people seem to be completely unconcerned about the manner in which the price is growing. If it keeps moving sideways and then keeps pumping, most of them will not mind as long as it doesn’t begin to do the same thing in the other direction. However, that is the thing about pumps and dumps. There is a pump which is followed by a dump and the price reverts to its mean. The way in which BTC/USD has pumped the past few days is not sustainable in any way. The price is due for a sharp decline which is an eventuality that we are going to see sooner or later. There is no other way around it. That being said, we could see the price rise towards $5,500 or even $6,000 short term although that is very unlikely. It would also be very obvious as the majority of traders and investors are already expecting that. If something is this obvious, it rarely happens and markets have a way of surprising both bulls and bears at the same time. If Bitcoin (BTC) falls from current levels and breaks below the ascending triangle, it will have to settle atop the previous trend line support. This level could be easily broken and the price might plunge further into the red to trade in the $3,000s. A lot of traders assume that we are near the end of the bear market even though that would make the current cycle a lot shorter than the previous one. The price has closed below the 50 Week EMA, it is below the 21 Month EMA but it is hard to understand why traders are so eager to jump to conclusions. If anything, traders ought to be more bearish than bullish considering how overbought BTC/USD is on both the daily and weekly time frames. If we look at the RSI on the daily chart, it has come back to test the trend line support every time it has shot up. This means that no matter how high the price goes, it will still have to fall back to this very trend line support. This is why it is important note to chase the price but to let it come to you. The Stochastic RSI on the daily time frame is also extremely overbought and every time it has been this high, we have seen a reversion to mean. This time that reversion could mean a sharp decline below the 200 Day EMA which is going to unnerve a lot of traders and the panic selling we might see would be extraordinary. The reason I say it will be extraordinary is because very few people are prepared for that. Everybody is thinking this is the end and the price is going to shoot up in the next few weeks to begin a new cycle. When that hope bubble pops, it is not going to be a good day for a lot of retail traders.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Uber unveiled a new product Tuesday called Uber Vouchers thats designed to help businesses sponsor free or discounted ride-hail trips for their customers. Its the companys latest service aimed at growing the B2B (business-to-business) market, and the announcement comes right before Uber is expected to officially announce its public offering. Companies that already offer customers transportation such as shuttle services or rental cars, be it in the hospitality sector or in the insurance space, can now use Vouchers to offer Uber rides instead. Bars and restaurants can offer discounted designated driver rides to customers who have been drinking. Sports teams can bundle rides with other loyalty perks in an effort to encourage fans to make the trip to see the next game live. The new service is available in the majority of cities where Uber is present. Businesses can sign up for Vouchers by visiting uber.com/vouchers. Heres how it works, according to Uber: Companies can create customized Voucher campaigns and programs within a specified budget, set pick-up and drop-off locations, and an established time for an offer. All details can be tailored to an event, promotion or service. Businesses can send vouchers to their customers through email, social media and mobile messaging. Companies offering vouchers only pay for the rides redeemed under a campaign, plus any applicable administrative fees. When a rider redeems a Voucher, it is added automatically into the Payment section of the riders Uber app until it expires. Customers who receive a Voucher can apply it directly to their existing Uber account or will be prompted to download the app to redeem the discounted trip. A dedicated dashboard shows businesses how many Vouchers are redeemed and allows them to export anonymized trip information streamline reporting and billing. Ubers B2B team began beta testing Vouchers late last year across a diverse group of retailers, restaurants, and services, with over 100 global partners including TGI Fridays, Live Nation, the Golden State Warriors, MGM Resorts, Sprint, Freshworks, and European real estate developers Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield. Uber is now adding new partners, including Allstate, to broaden the program. While its core business remains focused on car service trips, Uber has rapidly expanded the number of B2B products it offers over the years. Uber Freight, the newly spun-out business unit that helps truck drivers connect with shipping companies, recently announced it was expanding into Europe. Uber Health is a digital tool to help health care providers book rides for patients who need assistance getting to and from their doctor appointments. And Uber Eats is a huge source of revenue for the money-losing ride-hail company, and recent data suggests its the fastest-growing meal-delivery service in the US.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'NEAR WEST SIDE A new brewery offering a cashless pour-as-you-drink tap system is joining Chicago’s growing “brewery district.” District Brew Yards will open Friday at 417 N. Ashland Ave. on the Near West Side near West Town’s border. The new spot, based on a collective business model, will be permanent production home to Burnt City Brewing, Around the Bend Beer Co. and Bold Dog Beer Co., with additional taps for guest brewers. District Brew Yards will also feature a beer hall with a cashless pour-your-own tap system and a retail area selling merchandise and freshly packaged beer. The Brew Yards idea is a “creative partnership” that embraces the “pioneering spirit upon which the craft beer industry was founded,” spokesperson Lacey Irby said in a press release. John Saller, head brewer of Burnt City Brewing, said The Brew Yards will help him get his beers into the hands of more people. This comes from our mixed-fermentation room and designated bottle filler, our ability to brew a huge range of batch sizesand then to put them all into cans and sell them in our package shopand the self-serve taps in the beer hall that allow our guests to sample a little bit of everything,” Saller said. The collective is opening in an area of Chicago that has become well-known for craft beer. A smattering of breweries can be found near this stretch of Ashland Avenue, including Goose Island Beer Co., Finch Beer Co., Great Central Brewing Co., All Rise Brewing Co. and On Tour Brewing Co.

       "   'content': 'Editor\\'s note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money\\'s newsletter. You can sign up here. It was only about 40 years ago that plastic bags became standard at U.S. grocery stores. This also made them standard in sewers, landfills, rivers and the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. They clog drains and cause floods, litter landscapes and kill wildlife. The national movement to get rid of them is gaining steam with more than 240 cities and counties passing laws that ban or tax them since 2007. New York recently became the second U.S. state to ban them. But these bans may be hurting the environment more than helping it. University of Sydney economist Rebecca Taylor started studying bag regulations because it seemed as though every time she moved for a new job from Washington, D.C., to California, to Australia bag restrictions were implemented shortly after. \"Yeah, these policies might be following me,\" she jokes. Taylor recently published a study of bag regulations in California. It\\'s a classic tale of unintended consequences. Paper or plastic? Before California banned plastic shopping bags statewide in late 2016, a wave of 139 Californian cities and counties implemented the policy themselves. Taylor and colleagues compared bag use in cities with bans to those without them. For six months, they spent weekends in grocery stores tallying the types of bags people carried out (she admits these weren\\'t her wildest weekends). She also analyzed these stores\\' sales data. Taylor found these bag bans did what they were supposed to do. People in the cities with the bans used fewer plastic bags, which led to about 40 million fewer pounds of plastic trash per year. But people who used to reuse their shopping bags for other purposes, like picking up dog poop or lining trash bins, still needed bags. \"What I found was that sales of garbage bags actually skyrocketed after plastic grocery bags were banned,\" she says. This was particularly the case for small, 4-gallon bags, which saw a 120 percent increase in sales after bans went into effect. Loading... Don\\'t see the graphic above? Click here. Trash bags are thick and use more plastic than typical shopping bags. \"So about 30 percent of the plastic that was eliminated by the ban comes back in the form of thicker garbage bags,\" Taylor says. On top of that, cities that banned plastic bags saw a surge in the use of paper bags, which she estimates resulted in about 80 million pounds of extra paper trash per year. Plastic haters, it\\'s time to brace yourselves. A bunch of studies find that paper bags are actually worse for the environment. They require cutting down and processing trees, which involves lots of water, toxic chemicals, fuel and heavy machinery. While paper is biodegradable and avoids some of the problems of plastic, Taylor says, the huge increase of paper, together with the uptick in plastic trash bags, means banning plastic shopping bags increases greenhouse gas emissions. That said, these bans do reduce nonbiodegradable litter. Are tote bags killing us? What about reusable cloth bags? We know die-hard public radio fans love them! They\\'ve got to be great, right? Nope. They can be even worse. A 2011 study by the U.K. government found a person would have to reuse their cotton tote bag 131 times before it was better for climate change than using a plastic grocery bag once. The Danish government recently did a study that took into account environmental impacts beyond simply greenhouse gas emissions, including water use, damage to ecosystems and air pollution. These factors make cloth bags even worse. They estimate you would have to use an organic cotton bag 20,000 times more than a plastic grocery bag to make using it better for the environment. That said, the Danish government\\'s estimate doesn\\'t take into account the effects of bags littering land and sea, where plastic is clearly the worst offender. Stop depressing me. What should we do? The most environment-friendly way to carry groceries is to use the same bag over and over again. According to the Danish study, the best reusable ones are made from polyester or plastics like polypropylene. Those still have to be used dozens and dozens of times to be greener than plastic grocery bags, which have the smallest carbon footprint for a single use. As for bag policies, Taylor says a fee is smarter than a ban. She has a second paper showing a small fee for bags is just as effective as a ban when it comes to encouraging use of reusable bags. But a fee offers flexibility for people who reuse plastic bags for garbage disposal or dog walking. Taylor believes the recent legislation passed in New York is a bad version of the policy. It bans only plastic bags and gives free rein to using paper ones ( counties have the option to impose a 5-cent fee on them). Taylor is concerned this will drive up paper use. The best policy, Taylor says, imposes a fee on both paper and plastic bags and encourages reuse. This bag research makes public radio\\'s love for tote bags awkward, doesn\\'t it? It might be weird though if we started giving out plastic grocery bags. Did you enjoy this newsletter? Well, it looks even better in your inbox! You can sign up here.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dow Jones futures fell slightly early Tuesday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. After the close, the FDA rejected a Zogenix ( ZGNX ) drug for a rare form of epilepsy, good news for GW Pharma ( GWPH ). Meanwhile, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to a PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals ( PHAS ) compound. The FDA also OK'd a Bio-Rad Laboratories ( BIO ) blood typing and screening system. Zogenix stock plunged after hours, while GW Pharma stock and PhaseBio stock rallied. Bio-Rad stock was quiet overnight. X Dow Jones Futures Today Dow Jones futures fell 0.1% vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.1% below fair value. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session. Current Stock Market Rally The Dow Jones fell 0.3% on Monday, dragged down by Boeing ( BA ), even as Apple ( AAPL ) broke out. The Nasdaq composite rallied for a 0.2% gain and the S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.1%. All three major indexes are about 2% from their all-time highs as the current rally is on the cusp of a l ong bull market phase. Apple's low-volume breakout wasn't especially inspiring but shares rose slightly in the premarket, providing some support for the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq. Zogenix Stock Pained, GW Pharma Gains The FDA late Monday refused to review Zogenix's Fintepla for treating Dravet, a rare form of epilepsy. Zogenix stock plunged 29% early Tuesday. Zogenix stock had tried to break out past a 55.10 cup-with-handle buy point on March 29 and April 1, but never closed above the entry. Meanwhile, GW Pharma stock climbed 4.4% before the open. Shares are working on a 182.33 buy point from a short flat base after breaking out from a wild, very deep cup with handle following earnings in late February. GW Pharma sells Epidiolex, a cannabinoid-based drug, to treat Dravet and other types of childhood epilepsy. The FDA approved it last June. PhaseBio Stock Jumps The FDA declared PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals' PB2452 a Breakthrough Therapy, giving the compound a better path for approval. The PhaseBio compound is a reversal agent for AstraZeneca 's ( AZN ) anti-clotting medicine, Brilinta. PhaseBio stock surged 33% early. Shares shot up 17% to 12.57 in Monday's stock market, hitting a new closing high. PhaseBio stock came public at 5 a share in October, fell to 2.55 in November but has been on a tear since March 12. Bio-Rad Stock Near Buy Point The FDA OK'd a Bio-Rad Laboratories system for blood typing and screening for small to midsize labs. Bio-Rad stock was not trading overnight. Shares rose 0.4% Monday to 309.84. Bio-Rad stock is working on a 324.04 cup-with-handle buy point. How To Play Biotech Sector Individual biotech stocks are subject to sudden spikes on news. One way to minimize stock-specific risk is via ETFs. Among the best ETFs for biotechs, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF ( IBB ) is near a buy point. The SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF ( XBI ) is just above an entry. Please follow Ed Carson on Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.

       "   'content': 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state officials told food growers and processors in mid-December that they had the state’s blessing to produce and sell tea and chocolates laced with CBD, the cannabis derivative reputed to ease anxiety and other ills without marijuana’s high. But since then, New York City health inspectors have seized thousands of dollars worth of CBD-infused food and drinks at the Fat Cat Kitchen and other local cafes and restaurants, and warned owners to stop selling them or face penalties. The crackdown came just weeks after federal law explicitly made CBD legal across the country. The New York City crackdown highlights the inconsistencies that have emerged in federal, state and local rules governing CBD, bewildering the small but growing number of businesses selling edibles in New York and other states. “I’m trying to be compliant with the law, but no one seems to be fully aware of what the law is and isn’t,” said C.J. Holm, the owner of the Fat Cat Kitchen, which touts CBD coffee and cookies on a sidewalk chalkboard. Consumer interest in CBD tinctures, topical creams and edibles has grown in recent years in step with the piecemeal legalization of marijuana, which is now permitted as either a medical or recreational drug in 33 states while still banned by the federal government. In 2018, U.S. consumers spent an estimated $300 million on CBD food and drinks, according to a report by Cowen Washington Research Group. The Coca-Cola Company and other food giants have expressed interest in the sector. The 2018 Farm Bill, enacted in December, was intended in part to clear up the legal status of CBD by legalizing cannabis extracts derived from strains of the plant, known as hemp, that contain very low concentrations of THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana. But the law also created new confusion for businesses wanting to sell CBD food or drink. For some, it is impossible to follow one set of regulations without being in breach of another. In New York, for example, officials at the state Department of Agriculture issued guidance in December saying it was legal to sell “CBD tea,” “chocolates with CBD drizzle” and other CBD edibles, so long as the products are made and marketed as dietary supplements, which are governed by more stringent standards than ordinary food. But the department also warns that doing this will run afoul of rules issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which said it was unlawful to add CBD to food or to market it as a dietary supplement. That is because the agency, for the first time last year, had approved a drug that contained CBD as the active ingredient. New York City health inspectors have taken the FDA rule seriously. At the Fat Cat Kitchen, Holm was startled when a health inspector impounded her CBD powder, honey, snacks and raw cookie dough in February. Similar scenes played out at four other eateries in the city. Soon afterward, Holm and other restaurateurs received a letter from the department saying inspectors would resume the seizures after July 1. It is unclear whether the city’s Health Department will allow cafes and restaurants to sell CBD edibles even as a dietary supplement, despite New York state officials saying such products are legal. When asked, Michael Lanza, a Health Department spokesman, repeated the department’s position that it is following the FDA ban on CBD food and drink in any form. An FDA spokesman declined to comment on New York’s regulations. Colorado, Maine and other states have attempted to clarify the status of CBD-laced edibles by passing laws allowing the addition of CBD to food. The FDA has said it may make an exception for CBD, allowing it as a food additive or dietary supplement even though it is now a listed drug. It will hold a public forum on the issue in Maryland on May 31. With the conflicting rules and at best haphazard enforcement, Holm and other CBD vendors say they are pressing ahead, devising their own strategies that they feel are at least a gesture toward compliance. Igor Yakovlev, who stirs CBD into honey on New York’s Staten Island, prints a disclaimer on each Beezy Beez Honey jar stating that the FDA has not “evaluated or approved” his product. Holm, in consultation with a lawyer, noted that the FDA bans CBD being added to food for “interstate commerce,” and reasons she is fine to sell CBD coffee so long as the extract is produced and processed in New York. “It is so confusing because you can ask three different attorneys and get three different answers,” said Allan Gandelman, a farmer in Cortland who founded the New York Cannabis Growers and Processors Association earlier this year. “So you decide you’re going to blaze a path forward, and produce a product that customers really want, and go for it until the government gets its act together.” Reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; Editing by Frank McGurty and Dan Grebler'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Washing machines, dryers and other appliances are seen for sale at a Lowe\\'s home improvement store in Washington, D.C., Sept. 27, 2018. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images It was a daunting task. Amid a major renovation, Jani Mussetter needed a lot of appliances: a washer, dryer, refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher and stove. As she visited showrooms in January, a stressful thing kept coming up: warnings of a price increase on Feb. 1. For Mussetter, shopping for higher end appliances, that potentially meant paying hundreds of dollars more. And why? \"They said, because of all the tariffs,\" the San Francisco resident says. Tariffs and the trade war have been in the news for more than a year, since President Trump began imposing higher taxes on various imported products and materials. For regular American shoppers, major household appliances perfectly illustrate the complicated reality of the trade dispute. One tariff was a boon to some domestic manufacturers. But other tariffs hiked costs for the entire industry worldwide. Prices on appliances are now slowly recovering from their biggest increase in about five years. Whirlpool\\'s gamble Whirlpool, a leading American appliance maker, is at the heart of the issue. Its prices had barely changed for many years, says G.research housing analyst Alvaro Lacayo. Then, in 2018, he says, \"you saw a big tick upward.\" At first, higher prices were welcome news for Whirlpool. They reflected the company\\'s victory over its two main foreign competitors, South Korea\\'s LG and Samsung. Whirlpool which also own Maytag, Jenn-Air and other brands had spent years arguing that LG and Samsung had been \"dumping appliances into the U.S. market at below cost, rendering competition irrational,\" as Lacayo put it. In January 2018, President Trump agreed with Whirlpool. He set a new tariff, or tax, on imported washing machines, starting at 20 percent. So, selling washers to Americans became more expensive for foreign companies. And domestic manufacturers like Whirlpool could finally raise prices. But then, Trump imposed more tariffs, on metals including aluminum and steel. Steel, in particular, is critical to building almost any appliance. Suddenly, appliance makers everywhere, including Whirlpool, began complaining about the rising cost of raw materials. They had little choice but to start raising their own prices. \"Global steel costs have risen substantially and, particularly in the U.S., they have reached unexplainable levels,\" Whirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer said during an analyst call in July 2018. What happens next Steve Sheinkopf owns Yale Appliance &amp; Lighting in the Boston area, and he\\'s a third-generation owner. \"We have been here for almost 100 years now, it\\'s hard to believe,\" he says. Many brands Sheinkopf works with like Wisconsin-based Sub-Zero and Wolf or Germany\\'s Thermador regularly inch up their prices, he says, but the increases in the past year have been bigger than most. Sheinkopf predicts that appliance prices are probably stabilized at this point, at least for a while. But for shoppers who chase sales and specials, he says, promotions haven\\'t been as good as they used to be three to four years ago. Overall, prices of major appliances tracked by the consumer price index are starting to tick down month-to-month. But they are still higher than they were last year. \"On certain products, you could be looking at a 14- to 16-percent increase from last year to this year,\" Sheinkopf says. \"When you talk about [washing] machines that people want to buy, front-loaders, I think you\\'re looking at $200 to $400 difference versus last year.\" Many companies stretched some of the price increases into early 2019, still citing high costs of raw materials as well as changes in the currency market and labor costs. That\\'s what Mussetter experienced as she rushed to buy appliances for her remodel before Feb. 1. \"I\\'d be really bummed if I was walking in today,\" she says with a laugh. Mussetter did manage to buy all her appliances ahead of the price jump. Later, she learned this saved her $1,250. And one other thing happened last year, Whirlpool\\'s Korean competitors, LG and Samsung, fast-tracked new manufacturing plants in America. It\\'s great news for American jobs. But for Whirlpool? \"I think this is the biggest challenge they\\'ll ever have,\" Sheinkopf says.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Pinterest set the terms of its IPO on Monday, revealing a price range that could see the company debut on the public markets with an initial market cap below its last private valuation. The social content company has set a price range of $15 to $17 per share, which at the midpoint of the range would raise about $1.2 billion and give Pinterest an initial market cap of $8.5 billion—a sizable plunge from the $12.3 billion valuation it reached in 2017 with its most recent funding round and setting it apart from the rumors of skyrocketing valuations that have marked the wave of public offerings sweeping the tech industry. It is rare for a VC-backed unicorn to go public while slashing its worth. Since the start of 2010, the median valuation step-up for billion-dollar-plus VC exits over their last private valuation has remained above 1.8x, with only five of these unicorn exits during that period being down valuations, according to a recent PitchBook analyst note. If Pinterest were to go public with a share price around its projected range, it will join companies such as content management business Box and payment platform Square in the list of unicorns that were marked by a down valuation at the time of their exit. Investors have been grappling with Lyft 's dwindling stock price since it went public last month. The ridehailing unicorn's rocky IPO reception combined with Pinterest's discouraging initial pricing has raised questions around whether lofty private market valuations will be validated by investors in the public markets.

       "   'content': 'It’s not just OPEC production cuts, Venezuelan chaos, and sanctions that are pushing up oil prices this year--U.S. shale production is slowing, too. And the result is a phenomenal 30-percent rally in WTI Crude prices in the first quarter, with the U.S. benchmark jumping from as low as $45 a barrel in early January to as high as $60 at the end of March. These improving supply fundamentals, including waning concerns over global economic and oil demand growth, have led to oil’s best quarterly performance in a decade. But the key driver has been slowing growth in the U.S. shale patch in response to the 40-percent slump in prices in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to a note from John LaForge, Head of Real Asset Strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. While Saudi Arabia is the “swing” producer, managing the market by deliberately withholding or increasing production regardless of price, the U.S. is the world’s marginal oil producer—the country pumping what the industry refers to as the extra barrel of oil—so shale breakeven prices are key to determining global oil prices, LaForge says. But U.S. oil production growth is now slowing, with average daily U.S. crude oil production slipping in January from the previous month for the first time in nearly six months, according to the EIA’s report from end-March. And it’s in the margins that we should be looking. “Commodity prices are often set on the margin, which means that they are set by the country that is producing that extra barrel of oil, ounce of gold, or pound of copper. In the case of oil, the U.S. is producing that extra barrel of oil for the world to consume,” LaForge notes. Related: Shale Is In A Deep State Of Flux “The 2019 oil-price rally is a direct reaction to the potential for future U.S. production growth to slow,” according to Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which has a $65 a barrel year-end 2019 price target for WTI. Referring to the breakeven prices at the world’s marginal oil producer, LaForge said: “The mid-$40s is the point at which the average U.S. shale producer starts seriously questioning (curtailing) its future drilling plans—and this is precisely what happened at the end of 2018.” Shale producers tend to agree with that view. According to the Q1 Dallas Fed Energy Survey, with executives from 82 E&amp;P firms chiming in, average breakeven prices to profitably drill a new well range from $48 to $54 per barrel, depending on the region. Drillers need $50 a barrel on average to profitably drill a new well, down from $52 per barrel when the same question was asked last year. Average breakeven prices in Midland in the Permian were $48, the lowest-cost in the U.S., and the lowest-cost region in the past three years. “With the recent recovery in oil prices, the majority of firms in the survey can profitably drill a new well at current prices; 78 percent of responses were at or below the March 22 WTI spot price ($59 per barrel),” the survey showed. Related: Aramco’s Mega Debt Deal Is A Raging Success However, the Q1 rally from $45 to $60 has been significant, so looking forward, the higher WTI prices will likely result in extra U.S. oil production in the coming months, setting the stage for more supply on the global market, Wells Fargo Investment Institute’s LaForge said. “The next short-term oil move may be down, probably into the low-to-mid $50s. Later in the year, though, we suspect that WTI will make a run at $65 as geopolitical tensions heat up among oil-related countries,” he noted. Later this year, oil prices will be driven by a combination of many factors, including, but not limited to, the pace of U.S. production growth. The tightening U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, the upcoming U.S. waivers decision for Iranian oil buyers, OPEC’s next production policy move, and geopolitical flare-ups such as those in Algeria and Libya will influence the supply side of the oil market. Global economy and trade issues will determine how resilient (or not) oil demand growth will be this year. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:'},\n",

       "   'content': 'THE FORMER FBI AGENT who headed up Wynn Resorts security operation no longer has a job at the international casino business four days after telling regulators he spied on employees and the ex-wife of the companys founder. The casino company, which plans to open an Everett resort in June, has been under scrutiny since a January 2018 Wall Street Journal story reported on multiple allegations of sexual harassment and worse against founder Steve Wynn, who resigned soon after the story was published. As the Massachusetts Gaming Commission attempted to determine whether Wynn Resorts should keep its casino license, the companys security chief, James Stern, acknowledged that he covertly surveilled Elaine Wynn and also spied on others, including one of the sources for the newspaper story. According to a legal brief filed with the Gaming Commission on Monday, Matt Maddox, the CEO of Wynn Resorts, contacted Stern on Saturday and told him his services were no longer needed. The filing also said “no surveillance will be conducted of employees or third parties without the permission of the chief global compliance officer and the general counsel or other in-house counsel to whom she delegates responsibility.” Stern told the commission that he only surveilled Elaine Wynn when she was in the company of Kazuo Okada, a Wynn Resorts investor who Stern claimed had organized crime connections, but a spokeswoman for Elaine Wynn later said she has never met with Okada.The 49-page legal brief, which described the dismissal of Stern as a “remedial measure,” argued that Wynn Resorts should retain its casino license in Massachusetts and that no action be taken against Maddox, who faced hard grilling from several commissioners during a three-day hearing last week. The hard questions focused on Maddox’s lackluster initial response to the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Steve Wynn, “Mr. Maddoxs initial response was based on his utter disbelief that Mr. Wynn engaged in such egregious conduct. Mr. Maddoxs immediate actions reflected that belief, but his subsequent actions are clear and convincing evidence that his suitability determination should not be disturbed,” the legal brief says. “To be clear, there is absolutely no evidence that Mr. Maddox was aware of any of the allegations of sexual misconduct at the time that they were made to other executives. No one has testified (or even suggested) that Mr. Maddox was aware of those allegationsnot one email or other piece of evidence exists to show that he was advised of those allegations, and he has twice testified under oath that he was not aware of them. That other executives knew and failed to advise Mr. Maddox is their failure, not his.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The former Gawker Media properties now known as Gizmodo Media Group have another new owner. Univision acquired those properties (including Gizmodo, Jalopnik, Jezebel, Deadspin, Lifehacker, and Kotaku) for $135 million in the Gawker bankruptcy auction (following the Hulk Hogan lawsuit) back in August 2016, but indicated last summer that they were exploring selling those sites, as well as The Onion, The A.V. Club, The Root, and others. And now, as Benjamin Mullen of The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, those properties have been acquired by private equity firm Great Hill Partners for “much less” than Univision paid. As Todd Spangler writes at Variety, this signals a change in approach for Univision: With the sale, Great Hill will form a new company called G/O Media Inc., headed by digital content industry vet Jim Spanfeller, who also will be a significant investor in the company. The sale puts an end to Univisions bid under then-CEO Randy Falco to diversify beyond its Hispanic broadcasting core business into what it had hoped would be a fast-growing, young-skewing mass digital play. …Univision had said last summer that it was looking to offload the digital-media assets. With the exit by Falco and appointment of TV veteran Vince Sadusky as Univisions CEO, the company decided to full return to its focus on Hispanic media and marketing. Our aim from the outset of this process was to sell these assets as one, Sadusky said in a statement. We are pleased to have found a terrific buyer in Great Hill Partners that is committed to growing these properties. What will that mean for these sites? Well, Spangler writes that Univision said the Gizmodo Media Group and Onion sites will continue to operate as “independent assets within the Great Hill Partners portfolio,” and that “all employees of GMG and The Onion will be joining G/O Media.” That doesn’t mean there won’t be layoffs following the acquisition, though. And it will be interesting to see what Spanfeller does with these sites. His previous work includes time as president of Ziff Davis Enterprises consumer magazine group, publisher of Inc. Magazine, and associate publisher of Playboy Enterprises Publishing Group, a stint as the editor in chief of Forbes.com, work at PC Magazine and RealClearPolitics, and the creation of his own Spanfeller Media Group (including The Daily Meal and The Active Times), which he sold to the then-Tronc in 2017. And an email he sent to Gizmodo Media Group staff this morning had a lot of buzzwords in it, as Madison Malone Kircher writes at NY Mag : Spanfeller sent an email to his notoriously independent new staff this morning, saying he looks forward to meeting everyone soon and answering their (likely many) questions. Including ones about editorial independence: While editorial independence is critically important, there needs to be a healthy and productive partnership with the business side for the company to be truly successful, Spanfeller wrote. Without an audience we have nothing to offer advertisers, eCommerce partners or subscription efforts. And without the revenue from those sources we have no way to fund the content and those who create it that attracts that audience in the first place. He also explained he wants to establish a new set of company values and laid out a rough draft of his ideas. Feel free to help make these better and perhaps more attuned to G/O Media. From Spanfellers email: · We are action oriented. When faced with an option of action vs. in-action, we always choose to DO SOMETHING. · We believe in our people. We respect our teammates. We know that if they do something they will, much more often than not, DO THE RIGHT THING. · We are ambitious. Both as a company and as individuals. We want our people to always be looking to take the next step up in everything they and we do. To BE GOAL ORIENTED. · We respect and value our customers. Without visitors, we would have no marketing partners, without marketing partners we could not serve our users. To protect both of these very important groups we do business WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF INTEGRITY. In how we deliver content and in how we conduct our day to day business activities. · We want our work environment to be one where people can BE PASSIONATE AND HAVE FUN. At any rate, it’s certainly notable to see the Gizmodo titles exit Univision for a new owner. The combined Gizmodo/Onion sites have 100 million unique visitors per month as per the company’s release, so they remain a significant player on the web. But the “much less” price than the $135 million Univision paid for the Gawker assets (not counting what they paid for their stake in the Onion sites) after almost a year of searching for a buyer illustrates the wider challenges out there in the digital publishing world. We’ll see what’s next for the Gizmodo titles. [ The Wall Street Journal ]'},\n",

       "   'content': \"CEC Entertainment Inc., parent to the Chuck E. Cheese's and Peter Piper Pizza brands, has agreed to merge with Leo Holdings Corp., a special purpose acquisition shell company founded by executives of British private-equity firm Lion Capital, with the intent of going public again later this year, the firms announced Monday. The deal is expected to be completed in the second quarter, and CEC owner Apollo Capital Management LLC, which took Chuck E. Cheeses private and bought Peter Piper Pizza in separate 2014 deals, will retain 51% ownership in Leo Holdings, which plans to change its name to Chuck E. Cheese Brands Inc. and offer shares on New York Stock Exchange. The companies said the merger of CEC parent Queso Holdings and Leo Holdings has an enterprise value of $1.4 billion. The 750-unit CEC, which includes reported sales of $896 million in fiscal 2018. The boards of both Queso and Leo has approved the proposed deal, and Leo shareholders will vote on the plan. CEC has proven resiliency, said Lea Lyndon, chair and CEO of Leo Holdings and a founder of Lion Capital, in a webcast Monday. Its been around for 42 years. This is a very defensive play with very attractive cash characteristics. Lion Capital, which in February 2018 raised $200 million for the Leo Holdings SPAC, has invested in such foodservice brands as Round Table Pizza, Marble Slab Creamery, Great American Cookies, Gordon Ramsay restaurants and Wagamama. Apollos investment holdings include such foodservice brands as Qdoba, CKE Restaurants and Sprouts Farmers Market. Upon completion of the merger, Lyndon said he and Andy Jhawar, a senior partner at Apollo and head of its consumer and retail group, would serve as co-chairs of Chuck E. Cheese, and Tom Leverton, CEO of CEC for the past five years. Leverton, on Mondays call, said the company plans to increase the number of visits per year and boost spending through the All You Can Play platform. He said the company also is working to expand unit average unit volumes beyond the current $1.6 million with a 12% sales lift (to about $1.8 million) by extending the ongoing remodel program, which began in 2017 and added 25 more restaurants in 2018. CEC plans to reimage about 60 more locations this year. CEC also plans to expand its international development, which has 109 units abroad. Our first India location will open in 2019 or early 2020, Leverton said, providing us with a great gateway to Asia. CEC reported preliminary same-store sales increases of 7.7% in the first quarter, following a 3.3% increase in the fourth quarter and a 2.2% increase in the third quarter of 2018. CEC has 606 Chuck E. Cheeses units in 47 states and 14 countries. The company has 144 Peter Piper Pizza units in six states and Mexico.

They also removed Mr. Kelly, who is free on bail in Tokyo, from his seat on the board. Mr. Ghosns sudden fall plunged the auto-making alliance of Nissan and Renault into chaos. Mr. Ghosn led both companies and the alliance itself, and his arrest added tension to a relationship that already had begun to fray as Nissan struggled to assert independence from Renault. But in recent weeks, the group, which includes the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi, has pledged to redouble its efforts to work together. Renault is eager to move on and focus on the future business of the alliance. Tensions had blown up between it and Nissan after Mr. Ghosns arrest, as Nissan leaked allegations of his wrongdoing into the media. Renault and the French government, its biggest shareholder, responded bitterly and maintained a presumption of innocence toward Mr. Ghosn. But in recent months, Renaults own internal investigations began to turn up questionable use of company funds by Mr. Ghosn. These included a lavish Marie Antoinette-themed wedding party at Versailles, and payments to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman that are suspected of being used to help finance Mr. Ghosns yacht. Renault referred both findings to French prosecutors. In March, the companies announced the formation of a new operating board for the alliance, after discussions at Nissans headquarters in Yokohama aimed at creating a new path forward for the three automakers, with a greater voice for the junior Japanese partners. The board includes two representatives from Renault and one each from Nissan and Mitsubishi. Still, questions surrounding the imbalance in the alliances ownership structure remain. While Renault has argued that closer ties would help the companies work better together and share costs, some Nissan executives remain concerned that Renault, which holds a 43 percent stake in the Japanese automaker, would still wield greater power. Nissan owns a 15 percent nonvoting stake in the French automaker.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"The growing appetite for plant-based meat is prompting a Chicago-area company to build a $310 million production facility in central Indiana that eventually will employ 460 people. Elmhurst -based Greenleaf Foods said Monday the plant would be built on a 57-acre site in Shelbyville, about 20 miles southeast of Indianapolis. Production at the 230,000-square-foot facility is expected to begin in late 2020. Greenleafs two plant-based brands Lightlife burgers, hotdogs and deli meat and Field Roast sausages and roasts are currently manufactured at opposite ends of the country in Seattle and Turners Falls, Mass. The expansion comes at a time when the plant-based meat substitute industry is growing like gangbusters. U.S. retail sales of plant-based foods that directly replace animal products have grown 17 percent in the past year to over $3.7 billion, according to data from the Good Food Institute. Greenleafs business is booming too, said President Dan Curtin. We are seeing a whole movement as people are looking for options for protein, Curtin said. The category is up 40 percent over last year and the first quarter this year we saw double-digit growth. We expect to see that in the future. The companys Elmhurst corporate offices have grown from three people to 40 people in the past year, Curtin said, and hes continuing to hire locally. The company said it considered Illinois during the early stages of the selection process before choosing Shelbyville. We had a whole matrix of different nuances we were looking at logistics, infrastructure, among other things, Curtin said. Based on all these things, Shelbyville made the most sense for us. Indiana provided roughly $50 million in government and utility grants and incentives, including $9.6 million toward capital and one-time start-up costs and roughly $40 million in 10-year operational support, according to Greenleaf. The incentives however, werent the main factor at all, Curtin said. Greenleafs newest product, the Lightlife Burger, will join a handful of plant-based burgers aimed at whetting the palates of not only vegans and vegetarians, but carnivores who crave the flavor and texture of real meat. Curtin said the product, derived from pea-based proteins, will launch locally in Jewel-Osco grocery stores later this month. Greenleaf says the plant will be North America's largest plant-based protein facility, annually producing 60 million pounds of refrigerated alternative protein products. An earlier version of this story described Greenleafs brands as vegetable-based. They are plant-based. The Associated Press contributed. crshropshire@chicagotribune.com Twitter @corilyns\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'Ever since Dec. 3, 2018, when the yield curve inverted (with the yield of 2.83% on the five-year Treasury note 1 basis point lower than the yield of 2.84% on the three-year Treasury note ), I have been receiving calls and emails from worried investors about the impact of an inverted yield curve. The reason they worry is the much-publicized relationship between inversions and recessionsinverted curves have predicted all nine U.S. recessions since 1955. You can observe the relationship in the following chart from WealthManagement.com, which shows the yield spread between two-year Treasury notes and 10-year Treasury notes during the most recent recessions (shaded in gray). Recent history shows that a recession follows yield curve inversion in an average of 16 months, and the setback lasts, peak to trough, for an average of 12 months. The question is, should you be worried about the inversion? Before tackling that issue, its worth noting that, on Dec. 3, 2018, the S&amp;P 500 Index closed at 2,790. On April 3, 2019 it closed at 2,873, a gain, not including dividends, of about 3%. Its also worth noting that, given concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth, on March 20, 2019, the Fed announced it does not expect to raise rates further this year. That said, should you be concerned, or acting, based on the recent inversion? Should You Care? To begin, it is important to understand that what matters is not just the relative level of interest rates, but whether the Feds policy is accommodative or contractionary. The reason we have experienced recessions after inversions is that Fed policy was contractionary as it tried to fight inflationary pressures. By raising real interest rates to levels sufficient to slow demand and fight inflation, the Fed can cause a recession. With this understanding, we should ask whether Fed policy is currently in a contractionary or accommodative regime. When it comes to monetary policy, it is the level of real interest rates, or the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate, that matters. On average, the real federal funds rate is positive. Over the last seven decades, it averaged about 1.3%. We fell well below that level in January 2008, when the Fed slashed rates to try to prevent a depression. The Fed has kept policy accommodative since then. The latest forecast from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphias Survey of Professional Forecasters is for inflation to be 2.0% in 2019. With the current three-month Treasury bill rate at 2.42%, we have a real three-month Treasury bill rate of just 0.42%, well below the historical average of 1.3%. Clearly, monetary policy is still accommodative and supportive of economic growth. As long as the real federal funds rate remains at relatively low levels and the nominal federal funds rate is basically flat relative to the five-year and 10-year Treasury notes, investors should temper any concern they have about an inversion in the yield curve. In addition to relatively loose monetary policy, we also have massively stimulative fiscal policy, with the budget deficit at about $1 trillion. That doesnt mean a recession isnt possible, as one can be caused by exogenous events, but it isnt going to be caused by monetary or fiscal policy that is too tight. Its also worth noting that while the curve inverted in December, the new claims for unemployment, at 202,000, just hit the lowest level since December 1969 (almost 50 years ago); employment rose 196,000 in March (producing a three-month average of 180,000); and average hourly wages for private-sector workers grew 3.2% from a year earlier ! Another reason you shouldnt focus on the slight inversion we have experienced relates to the fact that the flattening of the yield curve has mostly occurred at the longer end. While U.S. interest rates are well below historical levels, they are now well above those of most other developed countries. For example, the yield on 10-year U.K. gilts is just 1.08%. The yield on 10-year German bunds is slightly negative, at -0.01%. The yield on Japanese 10-year government bonds is also slightly negative, at -0.05%. Those low yields have led to the U.S. Treasury bond market attracting capital, suppressing our longer-term yields and flattening the curve. Normally, a flattening of the yield curve might signal the market is expecting weaker economic growth. However, today that flattening could just as likely be a result of safe-haven demand (capital flows to the U.S., as our economy is less likely to be negatively impacted by a trade war) and the global search for higher yields. Theres one other important point to remember: If the yield curve inverted further due to a weakening of the economy, it is likely that Fed policy would become even more accommodative, reducing the risks of a recession and a bear market. As the advice I offer is always based on the evidence, lets now turn to the evidence on stock returns following inversions. Stock Returns Following Yield Curve Inversions In an August 2018 article, What Does a Yield Curve Inversion Mean for Investors?, Dimensional Fund Advisors examined the returns to stocks following inversions for five major developed nations, including the U.S., since 1985. The article states: Equity returns (as measured by MSCI local currency indices) were a mixed bag in the three years following an inversion, with US index returns higher 66% of the time at the 12-month mark and only 33% of the time 36 months later. When all countries are included, returns of the indices were higher 86% of the time 12 months later and 71% of the time 36 months later. Dimensional concluded: It is difficult to predict the timing and direction of equity market moves following a yield curve inversion. My colleague, Jared Kizer, also took a look at returns following yield curve inversions. He examined inversions, defined as the spread between two- and five-year Treasuries, and found that the three years following one produced a total market beta premium of just under 3%, and the five years following one produced a total market beta premium of almost 11%. Jared also noted a very wide range of outcomes for the market beta premium over both horizons, but particularly for the five-year period. Among five-year periods, four results had negative total returns (although two of these overlap), with two of them being negative total returns in excess of 30% (the largest negative total premium was -42%). However, in some five-year periods, the total market beta premium was substantially positive, with a few results in excess of 50% (the largest was 69%). In other words, U.S. stock market returns have tended to be lower than their historical average, but still positive, following periods of yield curve inversion. The bottom line is that, while an inverted curve may be a reliable indicator that a recession is likely to begin, on average, within 16 months, it is not an indicator reliable enough to allow you to profitably time stock markets. That should not come as a surprise, as there is no evidence that active managers have been able to exploit any signal provided by well-publicized information on the predictive nature of yield curve inversions. If there were any evidence, we would see it in the annual S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices versus Active (SPIVA) scorecards. But none exists, in either the stock or bond market. Remember, if information is well known, any predictive value it contains is already built into current prices. Thus, its unlikely you can use it to generate outperformance. Investors fail to differentiate between information and value-relevant information, trading on what is nothing more than information that has no value. Certainly, if you hear it on TV or read it in the newspaper, it is far too late to act on it. Summary There will always be something for investors to worry about, which is why Warren Buffett warned that once you have ordinary intelligence, success in investing is determined far more by temperamentthe ability to ignore the noise of the markets and adhere to your well-thought-out plan that incorporates the risks of negative events. Hopefully, your plan reflects the certainty that negative events, including nonforecastable Black Swan events, will occur with a high degree of regularity and ensures you are not taking more risk than you have the ability, willingness and need to take. Getting that right increases your ability to ignore the noise of the market and raises the odds that your head, not your stomach, will be making investment decisions. Ive yet to meet a stomach that makes good decisions. Lastly, ask yourself this question: Is Warren Buffett spending even one minute worrying about a yield curve inversion? The answer almost certainly is no, because he has said he hasnt even looked at, or listened to, an economic or market forecast in more than 25 years. One of the great anomalies in finance, which I point out in my book Think, Act, and Invest Like Warren Buffett, is that while investors idolize Buffett, they not only fail to follow his advice but often do the exact opposite, to their great detriment. Summarizing, the strategy most likely to allow you to achieve your financial goals is to develop and adhere to a long-term plan in line with your ability, willingness and need to take risk. By doing so, you will be better able to look past the noise of the market and focus on investing in a systematic way that will help you meet long-term goals.

       "   'content': 'SEOUL -- Activist investor Korea Corporate Governance Improvement announced on Monday it has raised its stake in Hanjin-KAL to 13.47%, setting the stage for an ownership battle over the country\\'s largest transportation conglomerate following the death of its Chairman Cho Yang-ho on Sunday. KCGI said it bought a further 0.79% stake in Hanjin-KAL on the stock market over the last three weeks. The fund has been pressuring Hanjin-KAL, the holding company of Korean Air Lines, to improve its corporate governance since buying a 9% stake in the company in November. In late March, Hanjin-KAL fought off an attempt by the fund to unseat a director close to the late chairman. KCGI declined to comment on its recent stock purchase. Shares of Hanjin-KAL jumped 20.63% to 30,400 won on Monday following news of the chairman\\'s death on expectations of improved corporate governance at the company. The benchmark Kospi was up 0.04% to 2,210.60. Analysts say a battle for ownership of the conglomerate is now likely. Including the late chairman\\'s stake, the Cho family owns 28.95% of Hanjin-KAL, followed by KCGI with 13.47%. The National Pension Service is the third-largest shareholder with a 6.64% stake. \"I don\\'t think that Cho family has a big enough stake because it needs at least a 33% stake to defend its managerial rights under commercial law,\" said Park Ju-keun, president of CEO Score, a corporate analysis company. \"KCGI will demand many things [of Hanjin-KAL] to maximize its investment value.\" Park said the Cho family is expected to inherit the entire 17.84% stake owned by Chairman Cho in order to retain their influence, but he did not rule out the possibility of a family feud, which could threaten the family\\'s continued ownership. \"If the three siblings fight over managerial rights of the company, it would provide KCGI a chance to flex its muscles,\" he said. Cho has three children. His son, Won-tae, is president of Korean Air, while daughter Hyun-ah, a former vice president of the airline, was forced out of management following her involvement in the \"nut rage\" scandal of 2014. The other daughter, Hyun-min, resigned from her position as vice president of the airline last year after she allegedly physically abused an employee of an advertisement agency. Kang Seong-jin, an analyst at KB Securities, agreed with Park on the importance of the inheritance process. Cho\\'s wife and children will have to pay inheritance taxes estimated at 162.5 billion won, which may lead them to sell some of the shares, he said. \"How to inherit Cho\\'s stake in Hanjin-KAL will be the key factor in the group\\'s corporate governance and the stock prices of its main affiliates,\" Kang said. \"If the inheritance process does not go smoothly, it is expected that KCGI will strengthen its influence fast.\"'}]}"

       "  'content': 'Just how worried should we all be about 42-year-old billionaire Jack Dorsey ? A new podcast interview with fitness guru Ben Greenfield highlights the Twitter founder’s Stoic lifestyle and makes him sound like a member of a cult. Stoicism, writes Harley Monk in a piece in Medium, is primarily about “practicing mindfulness.” The principles are weird. For instance, Principle 3: “Picture life without the people and possessions you have to truly appreciate them.” There are normal things he does, like meditating twice a day and even walking five miles to and from work. But then there is a kookier side. For example, during a 10-day retreat in Pyin Oo Lwin (Burma) in late 2018, he was banned from using gadgets, doing physical exercise, talking and even making eye contact with other humans. At one point his mother noticed he had turned orange, which was the result of too much Beto Kerotine. So he temporarily switched to a more paleo diet. These days it’s lots and lots of Vitamin C. And eating like an anorexic. In the podcast interview, he describes his current daily routines, which involve fasting, intermittent sauna and ice baths and bizarre eating habits. Each morning he basically goes for a polar bear swim by taking a bath in ice cold water. He says it “unlocks his mind.” During the week, he eats only one meal each day — dinner. On the weekend, he fasts. (RELATED: Dorsey Draws Link Between Physical Danger And Twitter Activity) CNBC’s Cat Clifford writes that each evening he engages in ritualistic sauna and ice baths: “First he sits in his barrel sauna (set at 220 degrees) for 15 minutes, then hops into an ice bath (37 degrees) for three minutes. He repeats the process three times, finishing with one minute in the ice bath.” “This guy is the platonic ideal of a rich white person who spends a year at an ashram,” a journo cracked to The Mirror. Ben Dreyfuss, an avid SoulCyclist and the editorial director at Mother Jones, remarked, “Every day Jack Dorsey spends 1 hour mediating in the morning, 1 hour 15 minutes walking to work, 1 hour 15 minutes walking home from work, 1 hour meditating in the evening, 54 minutes jumping between a sauna and ice bath. No wonder Tweetdeck doesn’t work.” But some were more worried about Dorsey than Tweetdeck. “It sounds like Jack Dorsey might have a serious eating disorder,” wrote Manhattan author and writer Caroline Moss. “Walking 5 miles a day while only consuming one meal per weekday and no meals ion weekends is not a wellness hack…it’s a disease.” Amanda Mull, a staff writer at The Atlantic who has written about billionaires with strange dietary habits, says Dorsey’s daily behavior should not be emulated. “I wrote this last time Jack Dorsey talked about his fasting practice, but: I think it’s genuinely very dangerous for someone as influential as he is to preach the virtues of not eating until you hallucinate!” she wrote. Mike Monteiro, co-founder of Mule, an interactive design studio in San Francisco, didn’t sugarcoat his views about how Dorsey is living his life. “Way to promote eating disorders, @jack,” he wrote. “You stupid stupid stupid man.”'},\n",

       "  'content': 'In a LinkedIn post, Bridgewater Associates CEO Ray Dalio discussed why capitalism needs to be reformed. Ray Dalio, a billionaire market speculator and founder of the oddest investment company that I have ever come across, Bridgewater Associates, has been making the rounds on cable news and even \"60 Minutes\" feeding the liberal media what it loves most: A big, piping hot helping of bull---t about the various evils of capitalism and his solution to fix things by, of course, raising taxes on the rich. Not that this matters to most business journalists who are covering and loving Dalio’s weird roadshow because they aren’t very capitalist themselves. Telling most business reporters that “the American Dream is lost,” or “capitalism needs to be reformed” and we must make the “rich” pay their fair share is like offering President Trump three scoops of ice cream for dessert instead of two; you will never hear a word of protest. MORE FROM FOXBUSINESS.COM... This is a shame because Dalio is a particularly odd guy to be calling balls and strikes on capitalism. Yes, Wall Street guys like Dalio know a lot about markets, but they are particularly tone deaf on economics. They know how to make a quick buck on a trade but they know a lot less on how to make something work for the long haul. Dalio fits this profile neatly. He’s a billionaire many times over, not from inventing anything special, but as a market speculator. Now some of my best friends and sources are really good at market speculating, but that doesn’t mean they’re incredibly deep thinkers, and those who say they are, like Dalio, should be judged with a degree of skepticism. First, see Dalio’s book, “ Principles: Life and Work ”, a weird personal manifesto of what he believes are ways to be successful in business and life. Some of his principles are cringe-worthy obvious (PAIN + REFLECTION = PROGRESS), others just cringe worthy pedantic as in the one that advises: “Great planners who don’t execute their plans go nowhere.” Full disclosure: I haven’t read “Principles” but I bet I can probably get more practical self-help advice from a Tony Robbins video. Then listen to the problems he says he’s worried about and how he plans to fix them. Education, or the lack of it in poor communities, is high on his list. He wants to raise to taxes to make sure kids in poor school districts get a better education. Sounds good until you dig a bit deeper and realize that the money he’s raising goes right into the pockets of the teachers unions and education establishment which has spent the past two decades opposing school choice and other reforms that have been proven to benefit poor kids. Dalio has been talking a lot about the gap between the rich and poor, which he says remains disturbingly high and will sow the seeds of violent conflict. Ok, but lots of anecdotal evidence is pointing to the fact that a combination of the Trump tax cuts and a decline in immigration has increased wages on the low end of the scale. Meanwhile, a lot of other quantitative evidence shows the wealth gap grew alarmingly wide during the Obama years, and well after the ravages of the Great Recession, when the Fed printed money making stock speculators like Dalio rich, and expanded social programs that did little for the working class. Finally do a little research on the hedge fund he runs, Bridgewater Associates. Yes it\\'s big ($160 billion in assets) and successful most of the time, but it’s also run like a police-state version of a hedge fund. All meetings are taped and recorded. Secrecy is paramount and the firm is notorious for its strictly enforced non-disclosure agreements. All of which makes sense because we’re dealing with a lot of money here, but also because the place is so damn weird to work at, as I am told by my Wall Street sources who have a first-hand knowledge of the weirdness. In an almost cult like fashion, employees must read and nearly memorize a short version of Dalio’s mind-numbing “Principles” book. But that’s just the beginning. Dalio preaches something called “radical transparency,” where employees gather around and grade investment ideas in one of the investment world’s most hostile work environments, something along the lines of that famous Mexican standoff scene in “Reservoir Dogs” only without guns. People who stumble over one of Dalio’s “Principles” are subjected to what is known as a “public hanging” of ridicule. No wonder the turnover rate at Bridgewater is around 25 percent over approximately a year. All of which wouldn’t be so bad if Dalio and his crew were doing something special in the world. They’re not. They’re charging big bucks for investing money. In fact, they’re not doing anything special as far as investing goes. Since its inception, Bridgewater’s flagship “Pure Alpha Strategy” funds has had an annualized total return of around 12 percent, which makes it just a little better than the S&amp;P 500 index which I can buy from Vanguard. OK, Dalio must be doing something right or he wouldn’t be worth nearly $17 billion, right? Yes, it\\'s true that Dalio built his firm from scratch, and is smart at convincing people to give him their money, but that doesn’t mean his critiques of capitalism and his solutions are all that smart. Dalio is credited with predicting the 2008 financial crisis (he was far from alone on this one). But he also recently gave Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont $100 million to improve public education and fund a bunch of other great stuff like making poor communities a better place to live. Dalio is supposed to be good at numbers, which is why it’s odd that he thinks his $100 million filtered through one of the most wasteful state governments in the country will do much of anything. It’s also odd that Dalio thinks higher taxes are the solution to capitalism’s ills. Dalio told \"60 Minutes\" that people like him (i.e. the rich) should pay more to make the economy more equitable as long as the money is going to something “productive” like education. “Am I saying something that\\'s controversial?,\" he asked correspondent Bill Whitaker, who replied: “It\\'s just strange to hear it come from the mouth of a billionaire.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP It’s also absurd. Government is one of the least productive organizations on the face of the earth. We have a pension crisis, we had a housing crisis, and we have a student-loan debt crisis, not to mention a looming Social Security crisis, lots of debt and a fiscal deficit, because government is big and wasteful and inefficient. And who exactly are the people like Dalio who will be paying even more taxes? Does he mean we need to raise taxes on dudes who have $17 billion in the bank? Or people with just a few million? Try funding the utopia Dalio envisions by taxing billionaires and most will leave the country. Even if they stayed there wouldn’t be enough money to pay for all the education and poverty eradication in Dalio’s utopia. That’s why people who earn around $250,000 a year, not $250 million, get hammered so hard by the tax man: there’s more of them. My guess is that Dalio’s little capitalism bashing media tour is a manifestation of rich, white man’s guilt, and a need for a big liberal media hug as he approaches 70 years on this earth. Now that he got his hug, maybe he can just go away.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'One of the top use cases for Amazon Alexa is its ability to quickly summarize the day’s headlines via its customizable “Flash Briefing” skill. Now, Amazon is rolling out a new feature that will allow Alexa device owners to get more in-depth news from their preferred news provider, with this week’s launch of “long-form news.” Currently, the new feature works with news from Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN, Fox News, Newsy and NPR, Amazon says. Getting the news is already a top voice activity among smart speakers owners. According to a 2018 Adobe survey, 46 percent of voice assistant users ask their smart speaker for news. And today’s Alexa Skill Store lists over 5,000 voice apps in its News category, which indicates some level of consumer demand for this sort of content. But sometimes users want more than just a set of quick headlines. That’s where Alexa’s in-depth news feature aims to help. Amazon says that voice commands like “Alexa, tell me the news,” “Alexa play news,” or “Alexa play news from…” followed by the source’s name, will now launch in-depth news sessions featuring stories curated by the news provider. This can include stories from NPR’s most popular radio shows, CNN’s top headlines, Newsy’s video news, and others. Both Newsy and CNBC will offer video news stories on Alexa devices with a screen, like the Echo Show and Echo Spot. The rest will be audio-only. Customers can listen or watch all the news stories or move through the different stories with verbal commands like “Alexa, next” or “Alexa, skip” to jump ahead. When you ask Alexa for the news for the first time, the assistant will ask for your preferred provider. You’ll also be able to change this later in the same Settings screen where you currently configure your Flash Briefing preferences. This is a little confusing because the section is still labeled Flash Briefing, instead of something more appropriate, like “News” or “News settings,” for example. In addition, the process of using the new feature is a bit different for those customers who have already been using Flash Briefing, which is also confusing. If a Flash Briefing user asks Alexa for the news, the assistant will continue to play the Flash Briefing you’ve already configured and are used to accessing by saying things like “Alexa what’s the news?” or “Alexa, tell me the news,” among other things. If you want to instead now hear the long-form version of the news, you’ll need to specify a source by saying the specific command: “Alexa, play the news from CNN” (or whichever news provider you prefer.) Amazon seems to understand this process is a little clunky, telling us it’s still “early days” for the feature and it will “continue to listen to customer feedback and evolve the experience over time.” The launch is a big bet that smart speaker owners want to do more than stream music, control their smart home, or perform other minor tasks, like setting alarms, timers, or using lists, for instance. Instead, it sees Amazon Alexa, to some extent, taking the place of watching a nightly news telecast. That’s an option that many of today’s cord cutters don’t have, as they’ve given up pay TV for just Netflix or some other mix for streaming apps. Longer-form content could also give Amazon a place to put ad units in the future, if it wanted to go that route. The long-form news feature began rolling out to customers in the U.S. on Monday.'},\n",

Kennedy Airport along with \"viewing parties\" at some of its main hubs around the U.S. on Wednesday afternoon, according to a company invitation obtained by CNBC.

The company\\'s shares jumped by about 4% in after-hours trading on the news. JetBlue may add service to London but its plans could include other routes to European cities from its New York and Boston hubs. JetBlue declined to confirm whether it would make an announcement Wednesday but said in a statement, \"Potential routes to Europe could provide us an opportunity to grow our focus cities of Boston and New York as we consider the best use of our aircraft from a margin perspective in those cities.\" The move would pit the low-cost carrier against large international airlines like Delta, American, United and their European partners who dominate trans-Atlantic travel. A key part of JetBlue\\'s strategy in serving Europe would be its popular Mint business class, which features lie-flat seats and some suites with sliding doors as well as premium meals. \"When we think about trans-Atlantic, we do think we can disrupt largely around a Mint-like product because we\\'ve been so successful on flying to the West Coast with Mint,\" Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue\\'s president and COO said last September. The trans-Atlantic market, \"especially in the premium category, suffers from the same lack of competition and high fares that [transcontinental] routes in the U.S. saw before JetBlue introduced Mint,\" JetBlue\\'s statement said Tuesday.

       "  'content': 'NEW YORK Bank of America plans to raise its starting pay to $20 an hour over a two-year period, the bank said Tuesday, starting with a hike next month. The company, with more than 200,000 workers, said it is raising its minimum hourly wage to $17 on May 1 and will continue to increase pay until it hits $20 an hour in 2021. Bank of America raised its hourly minimum wage to $15 in 2017. \"If you get a job at Bank of America, you\\'ll make $41,000 per year,\" Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan said during a television interview on MSNBC. The timing of Bank of America\\'s announcement is no coincidence. Moynihan and the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and three other banks will appear in front of a House finance committee Wednesday in the most significant hearing on the banking industry since Democrats took control of the House earlier this year. Banks have been trying to polish up their images ahead of the hearing, well aware they had a record year in profits in 2018 thanks the tax cuts passed by Republicans in 2017. All the meanwhile the banking industry\\'s lobbyists have been pushing Congress to further unwind the rules and regulations put into place after the 2008 financial crisis. Wells Fargo announced last week that CEO Tim Sloan would step down from his position effective immediately. In a call with analysts, Sloan mentioned the political pressure over his leadership of the scandal-plagued bank had become too much. At JPMorgan Chase, CEO Jamie Dimon used his annual letter to shareholders, which is read by people both inside and outside the banking industry, to sell shareholders on the wages and benefit increases JPMorgan had made to employees last year. JPMorgan now pays its workers $15 to $18 an hour, and recently cut the deductible low-wage workers need to pay to access health care as well. \"This is the right thing to do, and we now offer well above the average hourly wage for most markets,\" Dimon said in his letter.'},\n",

Equipment for the factory will come in later, taking several months to be installed, be calibrated, and get up and running. The bottom tweet is a bonus tweet added after the article was published. The tweet confirms the breakneck pace that Tesla’s team in China continues to work at as it speeds along to get its newest factory building cars by the end of this year. Construction of the shell of the new building has been kept the world in a trance, with floods of daily updates from an army of impromptu social media hawks. Truth be told, the shell of the building is one of the least exciting parts of the construction, but it unfortunately, one of the only parts of the construction that we will be able to see. Once the walls go up and the roof is on, we’ll be back in the dark as to progress Tesla is actually making on its new Gigafactory in Shanghai. Presumably, semi truck loads of equipment coming in and out will be the only clues we will have as to the progress towards establishing the new Model 3 production lines. Tesla previously shared that its new Shanghai Gigafactory, which is also known as Gigafactory 3 (behind Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York), will initially produce the Tesla Model 3 at the end of this year. Production of the recently announced Tesla Model Y will follow next year as Tesla works to ramp up production of the launch of the new vehicle, slated for late next year. The Gigafactory 3 update from Musk came in response to a tweet from Tesla hawk and friend of CleanTechnica Vincent, who continues to leverage his Chinese network to keep the world informed about Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 progress and Chinese Tesla sales.

       "  'content': 'Investing.com - The S&amp;P 500 snapped an eight-day winning streak as global growth jitters and concerns about escalating U.S. and EU trade tensions soured sentiment on U.S. stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.72%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.61%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.56%. The EU warned it stands ready to retaliate should the U.S. move ahead with tariffs on $11.2 billion worth of EU goods, raising fears that both nations are on a collision course. Both sides accuse the other of illegally subsidizing their respective aircraft makers, Boeing in the U.S. and Airbus in the EU. The dispute has been tied up in litigation since 2004, but came to the fore last May when the World Trade Organization ruled that Airbus had received illegal government funding for its A380 and A350 models, adversely affecting Boeing\\'s sales. Trade aside, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) came under fire after the aircraft maker said total orders, a measure of future demand, plunged to 95 aircraft in the first quarter from 180 a year earlier. The aircraft maker\\'s much maligned 737 MAX jets saw orders plunge to zero following a worldwide grounding in March. Elsewhere, fears over global growth resurfaced, prompting investors to hold off of risky bets after the IMF cut its global growth outlook, citing Brexit-related uncertainties and U.S.-China trade tensions. The IMF sees global economic growth of 3.3% this year, down from the 3.5% it forecast in January. The broader market was also pegged back by falling energy stocks on the back of slump in oil prices as oversupply fears returned. The EIA lifted its forecast for 2019 and 2020 average U.S. oil production, while Russian President Vladimir Putin poured cold water on expectations for prolonged oil-production cuts, saying current oil prices were suitable for Moscow. In tech, semis stumbled amid fears the rally in the sector so far this year has led frothy valuations in chips stocks. “We downgrade semis to benchmark,” Morgan Stanley wrote in note Monday. \"The sector is now discounting above-trend growth in the U.S. We worry about a lengthening smartphone cycle.\" Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT ) ended the day nursing losses. With just a three days to go until JPMorgan and Wells Fargo kick off the first-quarter earnings season on Friday, investors are seemingly reining in bets on a bullish quarter, with many expecting a tough road ahead. First-quarter earnings are now expected to decline 4.2% year over year for S&amp;P 500 companies, according to FactSet, compared to a 3.9% decline forecast just one week ago. On the economic front, weaker-than-expected U.S. job openings added to the day\\'s gloom. Top S&amp;P 500 Gainers and Losers Today: Cerner (NASDAQ: CERN ), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST ) and Campbell Soup (NYSE: CPB ) were among the top S&amp;P 500 gainers for the session. Pentair (NYSE: PNR ), Under Armour (NYSE: UAA ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) were among the worst S&amp;P 500 performers of the session.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Levi Strauss ( LEVI ) posted a profit for the first quarter after, reporting for the first time since going public last month. X Levi earnings per share came in at 37 cents, swinging from a year-ago loss of 5 cents a share, which saw a transitional impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted net income jumped 81% to $151 million. Wall Streets analysts had not posted estimates for Levi\\'s earnings. Revenue rose 7% to $1.435 billion. In the Americas, net revenue grew 9%, or 10% on a constant-currency basis. In Europe, revenue rose 3%, or 10% on a constant-currency basis. In Asia, revenues climbed 8%, or 14% on a constant-currency basis. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 10%, due to a larger retail network and e-commerce growth. The company sees fiscal-year constant-currency net revenues growth in the mid-single digits. Management also sees full-year capital expenditures of $190 million-$200 million and nearly 100 new company-operated store openings. \"We delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit constant-currency revenue growth,\" said CEO Chip Bergh. \"Growth was broad-based across all three regions and all channels, demonstrating that our strategies are working and our investments are paying off.\" Since 2011, Levi earnings have grown at a compound annual rate of 11.3%, and net income reached $285 million in fiscal 2018. Revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 2.3% and hit $5.6 billion in 2018. The Americas made up 55% of sales, Europe made up 29%; and Asia, including the Mideast and Africa, contributed 16%. Meanwhile, industrywide jeans sales grew 2.2% to $16.7 billion last year after four consecutive years of declines, according to Euromonitor data. Denim also powered strong gains in apparel sales this past holiday season, while market tracker NPD Group has noted signs of slowing in athleisure as jeans and boots rebound. Levi Stock Shares rose 1.7% late after closing up 2.7% at 21.88 in the stock market today. Levi stock hit a high of 24.19 on April 1, but has been struggling to maintain its momentum. It has yet to form an IPO base. Levi stock performed above expectations when it went public, with shares jumping 32% on its first day of trading. Another indication of the demand was the IPO itself was oversubscribed and ended up pricing at $17 a share, above expectations. The Stock Checkup Tool shows Levi stock has mediocre fundamentals, which is why it has an IBD Composite Rating of 46. Levi earnings have been improving, with EPS growing by an average 133% over the past three quarters. However the three-year EPS growth rate is just 4%. In addition to jeans, Levi makes casual and dress pants, tops, shorts, skirts, jackets, footwear and related accessories. Its brands include Dockers, Denizen and Signature. VF Corp. ( VFC ), which plans to spin off its jeans brands, slipped 1.3%. Jeans retailer American Eagle Outfitters ( AEO ) lost 2.5%. IPO Stock On Trend Baird analyst Matt Tingler said denim could be coming back into fashion at an opportune time for Levi stock. \"Levi\\'s IPO shows that the denim category is in favor with investors and not dead as many believe. Denim has been under attack by athleisure clothing as consumers, particularly women, have transitioned their clothing away from denim,\" he said last month. \"There are signs, however, that denim is beginning to experience a resurgence, coincidentally, at the cost of athleisure clothing.\" Tingler also said there are good opportunities for the IPO stock if it can harness its brand in the lucrative Asian market. A strong presence there would boost Levi earnings. He also pointed out that strong performance for Levi could bode well for other established names that have fallen out of favor. \"A resurgence in Levi\\'s will also be an indication of consumers interest in heritage brands. Levi\\'s, much like Champion, which has seen exceptionally strong growth, had fallen out of favor for newer, more modern brands like Paige, Citizens for Humanity, Fidelity and other denim brands over recent years,\" he said.

       "  'content': 'China is home to the vast majority of cryptocurrency miners, as the country is privy to extremely low energy costs compared to the rest of the world. But as Bitcoin pric e finds new life, lawmakers in the country are considering banning crypto mining among 450 other activities that are deemed to be unsafe, wasteful of natural resources, or pollute the environment. The news is largely viewed as FUD in the crypto community, who have become accustomed to China threatening crypto in the past. Others believe that the news is actually bullish for Bitcoin, and could help the first every cryptocurrency become more decentralized. Crypto Community Sounds Off On China Bitcoin Mining Ban South China Morning Post reports that the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has revealed a draft list of industrial activities the government is interested in restricting or outright banning, which include cryptocurrency mining. Related Reading | Crypto Analyst: Higher High In Bitcoin Price Confirms Bear Market Bottom Is In Due to China dominating the Bitcoin mining industry, both in terms of the actual mining of BTC, as well as manufacturing the rigs that support the activity elsewhere, the entire crypto industry was up in arms this morning following the breaking news. Of course, China fears bring out the trolls. Let\\'s be clear: China banning PoW mining doesn\\'t mean they are banning rig manufacture. It doesn\\'t mean the end of Bitcoin. You\\'d think that maximalist trolls would have higher confidence and thicker skin. — Emin Gün Sirer (@el33th4xor) April 9, 2019 Cornell University professor and founder of Ava Labs Emin Gun Sirer took to Twitter to dispel the FUD, and clear up any confusion over what it means for Bitcoin. As he points out, manufacturing mining rigs wont end, and the news certainly doesnt mean the end of Bitcoin. Other crypto analysts and investors, simply shrugged off the news. \"China says it wants to eliminate bitcoin mining\" #Bitcoin Fud pic.twitter.com/t11kNWD695 — WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) April 9, 2019 China has repeatedly flip-flopped its position on cryptocurrencies, but overall hasnt been welcoming to the new financial technology and emerging asset class. What Does the China Mining Ban Mean for Bitcoin Price? Sirer suggests that previous China FUD has resulted in bullish price action in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but calls the effects of the recent news pretty weak. Historically, news of this kind (aka \"China FUD\") has been correlated with price upticks. Though as far as consumer-affecting FUD goes, this is pretty weak. The impact is on miners, not regular users. — Emin Gün Sirer (@el33th4xor) April 9, 2019 BTC has continued to range below resistance at $5,300 after a nearly $1,000 rally early last week, that began once Bitcoin broke $4,200. The price has remained mostly stable despite the largest source of BTC mining potentially being barred from the activity. Related Reading | Bitcoin Price Surged More In 1 Hour Than Last Two Months Combined Regardless of the lack of price action in response to the news, there are still many positive implications for Bitcoin that could stem from such a ban. Bullish for 2 reasons: 1- higher costs elsewhere 2- more decentralization — Der_Kil (@ilk_erd) April 9, 2019 With China no longer able to dominate Bitcoin mining, the network will become more decentralized and therefore safer in general. In the past, China was said to have the means and potentially the motive, to destroy Bitcoin. The motive may remain, but the means will be greatly diminished should the NDRC proceed with their proposed amendments.'},\n",

To be sure, Q1 will be a bit complicated for banks--the government shutdown depressed IPO activity in January, the stock market rebounded from December\\'s drop, and the Fed\\'s last rate hike in December likely marks a peak in interest rates. Analysts and investors will watch trading revenue carefully after a brutal Q4. For Q1, market volatility and the government shutdown led to a \" sluggish environment for trading and investment banking,\" Buckingham Group analyst James Mitchell wrote in a note. Trading revenue at the biggest banks is expected to drop 14%, says RBC Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy. Commercial and industrial lending growth will help larger banks, according to Raymond James analyst David Long. Consumer banking was strong in Q4 for most banks, and may continue as well for this quarter. Analysts expect JPMorgan\\'s Q1 EPS to rise 4.0% Y/Y while Wells Fargo\\'s is expected to fall 1.3%, according to consensus estimates. As earnings season approaches, the outlook becomes more muted. In the past month, the consensus estimate for JPMorgan\\'s Q1 EPS slipped 1.1%. The consensus for Wells Fargo declined only 0.2% over the same period, but it already started out with a dimmer view.

       "  'content': 'Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to publicly endorse Herman Cain for the Federal Reserve Board after signaling last week that the former pizza chain executive and 2012 Republican presidential candidate would struggle to get through the GOP-led Senate. President Trump has said he wants to nominate Cain to the nations central bank, as well as conservative economist Stephen Moore, which would give him two allies on the Feds board to stake out the presidents interests. McConnell (R-Ky.) punted Tuesday when asked by reporters whether he would support the nominations of Cain and Moore. Well, were going to look at whoever he sends up, and once he does, well take a look at it, McConnell told reporters. McConnells noncommittal stance on Trumps preferred picks, neither of whom have been officially nominated yet, suggests at minimum serious trepidation among Senate leadership that these men are worthy of consideration for such crucial financial roles. Republicans have privately expressed concern that selecting ideological partisans to the board risks politicizing the Fed, which is designed to be an independent governing body. Also, neither man is particularly well-versed in monetary policy. Additionally, Cain is tarred by sexual misconduct allegations that all but ended his presidential campaign in 2012. If Cain is nominated by Trump, that history would be a focal point of his confirmation hearings. Cain has denied the accusations, but it is a very different political climate than the one he ran in seven years ago. In a post-Me Too era, Republicans will not be eager to bring up a Trump-backed nominee who will face scrutiny over his treatment of women. Top Senate Republicans, including McConnell and Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), have privately encouraged GOP senators to proactively relay their concerns to the White House if they hear about a potential nominee who would run into confirmation troubles in the Senate. I think itd be really good if they consult ahead of time and find out. There are some names out there that arent confirmable. And we would tell them that, if asked, Thune said Tuesday. It certainly isnt to their advantage to send somebody up here thats not gonna be able to be confirmed. Erica Werner contributed to this report.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Evenity (romosozumab-aqqg) to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of breaking a bone (fracture). These are women with a history of osteoporotic fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture, or those who have failed or are intolerant to other osteoporosis therapies. More than 10 million people in the U.S. have osteoporosis, which is most common in women who have gone through menopause. People with osteoporosis have weakened bones that are more likely to fracture. “Today’s approval provides women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture with a new treatment that will reduce this risk,” said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D, M.M.Sc., director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products. “But Evenity may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death so it’s important to carefully select patients for this therapy, which includes avoiding use in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year.” Evenity is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the protein sclerostin and works mainly by increasing new bone formation. One dose of Evenity consists of two injections, one immediately following the other, given once a month by a health care professional. The bone forming effect of Evenity wanes after 12 doses so more than 12 doses should not be used. If osteoporosis therapy is needed after the 12 doses, patients should begin an osteoporosis treatment that reduces bone breakdown. The safety and efficacy of Evenity were demonstrated in two clinical trials involving a total of more than 11,000 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. In the first trial, one year of treatment with Evenity lowered the risk of a new fracture in the spine (vertebral fracture) by 73% compared to placebo. This benefit was maintained over the second year of the trial when Evenity was followed by one year of denosumab (another osteoporosis therapy) compared to placebo followed by denosumab. In the second trial, one year of treatment with Evenity followed by one year of alendronate (another osteoporosis therapy) reduced the risk of a new vertebral fracture by 50% compared to two years of alendronate alone. Evenity followed by alendronate also reduced the risk of fractures in other bones (nonvertebral fractures) compared to alendronate alone. Evenity increased the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in the alendronate trial, but not in the placebo trial. Therefore, Evenity contains a boxed warning on its labeling stating that it may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death and should not be used in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year. Health care professionals should also consider whether the benefits of Evenity outweigh its risks in those with other risk factors for heart disease and should discontinue Evenity in any patient who experiences a heart attack or stroke during treatment. Common side effects of Evenity included joint pain and headache. Injection site reactions were also observed. The FDA granted the approval of Evenity to Amgen. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency is also responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. ###'},\n",

In a bid to save on labor costs, its betting on robots to clean floors, sort inventory, and replenish out-of-stock items in its stores, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Walmart has several jobs in mind for the new robots. Robot floor cleaners are coming to 1,500 stores. (The company says that floor scrubbing was previously a task that could take a human worker two to three hours each day to complete.) Walmart is also adding 600 conveyor belts that can sort inventory automatically, and at least 300 bots that can check if shelves are running out of stock after Walmart initially began to test this technology in 2017. All of this is coming at the cost of human labor. The more robots Walmart hires, the fewer people it needs for each task, and the more money it saves across its 4,600 stores in the US. Walmart says that although its cutting down on labor for tasks like flooring cleaning, it is hiring employees to focus on growing its online grocery business. The move also comes after retail companies like Target and Walmart announced slight wage increases for store workers. Walmart appears to be trying to make its online grocery service competitive to AmazonFresh and Amazon Prime Nows Whole Foods delivery, both of which are still expanding. Its part of a long feud between the two retail giants. While the brick-and-mortar Walmart has been pushed to acquire Jet.com and establish more of an online presence, Amazon has added physical stores to its e-commerce offerings and began to follow the playbooks of more traditional brands. Just last week, Amazon announced a new round of price cuts at Whole Foods stores around greens and tropical fruits. The company also reportedly has plans to expand grocery stores in major US cities later this year.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'NEW YORK &gt;&gt; Just last year, a kid in the market for an Uncle Milton ant farm could choose from a half dozen versions, including glow-in-the-dark or an ant village. Now there are only three. Last year, there were 60 kinds of K\\x92Nex construction sets on the market. This year there are 20. DENNIS ODA / SEPT. 28, 2010 Shoppers arrive at the Toys R Us store in Aiea in 2010. A slew of retailers like Walmart, Target and Party City rushed to expand their toy aisles to capitalize on the demise of the Toys R Us chain. NEW YORK &gt;&gt; Just last year, a kid in the market for an Uncle Milton ant farm could choose from a half dozen versions, including glow-in-the-dark or an ant village. Now there are only three. Last year, there were 60 kinds of K’Nex construction sets on the market. This year there are 20. A year after Toys R Us imploded, toy makers are still readjusting to the big loss of shelf space. That means slashing the number of styles they carry, re-evaluating how they sell large toys like playhouses and cars, and changing their packaging to squeeze into smaller retail spaces. It’s a jolt for toy companies. They had already been trying to reinvent themselves amid an onslaught of changes, including kids’ evolving tastes toward gadgets, as well as the rise of Amazon and online shopping. They never expected the iconic chain to liquidate its 800 U.S. stores six months after it filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 2017. Some companies depended on the chain for as much as 40 percent of overall sales. A slew of retailers like Walmart, Target and Party City rushed to expand their toy aisles to capitalize on Toys R Us’s demise, but toy companies say they aren’t able to fill the void. The stores devoted big sections to toys year round and served as incubators of new trends. They also say that Toys R Us’ massive orders of tens of thousands of units offset the cost of production. All this has led to fewer options for kids. “Maybe the world only needs one kind of ant farm, but in the day, you had a choice,” said Jay Foreman, president and CEO of Basic Fun. The Boca Raton, Florida-based company purchased the assets of Uncle Milton, which makes ant farms, along with K’Nex and Playhut, over the past year. He is now evaluating his overall lineup. Many parents have taken note of the more limited options. Stephen Desch of Keyport, N.J., said when his now 3-year-old daughter wanted a crab-shaped sandbox, he found it at Toys R Us. But he can’t find certain items now, like a plush toy inspired by the Jay character from the Netflix show “Beat Bugs.” “It’s definitely annoying,” Desch said. Vanessa Myers of Bristol, Virginia, cites too many choices in some categories, like light up toys for the tub. But she does worry about the dwindling selection of dolls and bikes. “I really want dolls that are diverse,” in hair color and ethnicity, she said. Toys R Us collapsed after racking up nearly $3 billion in revenue last year, or 12 percent of the U.S. toy market, according to market research group NPD Group Inc. Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of TTPM, an online toy review site, estimates that 40 percent of Toys R Us business wasn’t scooped up. Even as the former investors of Toys R Us try to resurrect the business in the U.S. in time for the holidays, many expect it to be a shell of what it was. The effort follows a 2 percent drop to $21.6 billion in toy sales for last year, with demand weakening during the second half of the year with the loss of Toys R Us. That reversed four straight years of sales growth, NPD says. Mattel’s annual sales last year fell 8 percent, reflecting a negative 6 percent impact from the toy retailer’s liquidation. At Hasbro, annual sales dropped 12 percent, dragged down by the loss of Toys R Us. Mattel had been struggling for several years, but it had been starting to see a turnaround. Toy makers have been expanding online, but that isn’t the panacea, says Marc Rosenberg, the strategic marketing adviser who was behind the success of Hasbro’s furry hit Furby. Physical stores still drive the toy business and profitability since companies don’t incur shipping costs, Rosenberg says. Foreman agrees, saying his new line of Cutetitos — beanie babies wrapped up in a burrito blanket and launched for the holidays — would have fared even better if Toys R Us was around. Typically, Toys R Us would have devoted a 3-feet-by-16-inch display in a highly visible spot to a hot item. Instead, stores gave Cutetitos an area that measured 18 inches wide by 5 inches deep. Isaac Larian, CEO of privately held MGA Entertainment, has seen overall sales triple last year because of its popular LOL toys. But its Little Tikes division, which makes toy cars and playhouses that need big areas for display, suffered a 12 percent sales drop because of the loss of Toys R Us even as his business with Amazon rose 50 percent. Overall, 27 percent of its overall business stemmed from Toys R Us, but at Little Tikes, that figure was 40 percent. Larian’s Little Tikes toy factory — the largest U.S. toy factory — based in Hudson, Ohio, is running at 25 percent capacity. Larian says he’s cutting the number of Little Tikes toys it produces mainly because of the loss of Toys R Us. He’s now expanding into housewares to keep the factory busier. “Every day we are reinventing ourselves,” he said.'},\n",

The companies did not share the terms of the deal. Accenture says that Cirruseos strength and deep experience in Google’s cloud-based artificial intelligence solutions should help as Accenture expands its own AI practice. Google TensorFlow and other intelligence solutions are a popular approach to AI and machine learning, and the purchase should help give Accenture a leg up in this area, especially in the French market. The addition of Cirruseo would be a significant step forward in our growth strategy in France, bringing a strong team of Google Cloud specialists to Accenture, Olivier Girard, Accentures geographic unit managing director for France and Benelux said in a statement. With the acquisition, should it pass French regulatory muster, the company would add a team of 100 specialists trained in Google Cloud and G Suite to the an existing team of 2,600 Google specialists worldwide. The company sees this as a way to enhance its artificial intelligence and machine learning expertise in general, while giving it a much stronger market placement in France in particular and the EU in general. As the company stated, there are some hurdles before the deal becomes official. “The acquisition requires prior consultation with the relevant works councils and would be subject to customary closing conditions,” Accenture indicated in a statement. Should all that come to pass, then Cirruseo will become part of Accenture.'},\n",

Sure, it's only April and Spring Break hasn't even sprung for some, but that's the question most parents I know are buzzing about. Some even start the summer talk back as far as the end of winter break. As for what I do, I usually start planning from the summer before. Sound a little crazy? Well, with two kids, summer camp out here can cost no kidding up to about $10,000. That figure causes me to start to hyperventilate just a little if I think about it too much. Frankly, my family doesn't have that kind of money sitting around waiting to be spent. For my family, even thinking of spending that kind of money takes planning. And even then, so many of us can't, no matter how much planning, spend that kind of money. Many parents work hard to figure out fun and fulfilling summer activities that beat summer slide but also don't break the bank. Children in a summer class in Kennett Square, Pa., on July 21, 2014. (Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) So it becomes a game of finding early bird discounts here, coupons there, free and low-fee camps and incentives for spreading the word. Maybe bidding on school auction camp discounts can help or planning at Open Enrollment in the fall how much money we can afford to squirrel away in Dependent Care accounts to get reimbursed for summer dollars spent. The whole summer scramble to figure out camp and how to afford it is the topic of many conversations, texts and social media exchanges. So we want to create a conversation here.

Since it first launched, the micromobility company has charged $1 to unlock an electric scooter, plus 15 cents per minute of riding. Now, Bird is effectively doubling that per-minute fee in some cities, while lowering it in others. Similar to ride-hailing, big macs, and cups of coffee, our pricing now varies by city Bird wouldnt provide a full list of which markets would experience price fluctuations, but local media outlets and scooter watchers on Twitter have some of the details. Per-minute fees increased to 25 cents in cities like Austin, Texas and Los Angeles, to 29 cents in Baltimore, and to 33 cents in Detroit and Charlotte, NC. Some cities are getting price decreases to 10 cents / minute, like Bloomington, IL, Charlottesville, NC, and Columbia, MO. Similar to ride-hailing, big macs, and cups of coffee, our pricing now varies by city, the spokesperson said in an email. The price for our environmentally friendly scooters has been updated to range from 10 cents to 33 cents per minute. Bird doubled its per minute rates for scooter rides around the country from $0.15 per minute to $0.25-0.35 33 in Detroit, 29 in Baltimore, 25 in Austin &amp; LA So the service either loses money or costs a ton ($3.90 a mile, for an 11.3 minute, 1 mile trip Austin average). Or both pic.twitter.com/Qsj3l7uoVp Asher (@AsherDeMontreal) April 9, 2019 Some cities are requiring the scooter companies to pay large upfront fees to account for the costs of enforcement. Baltimore charged Bird and Lime each a $15,000 fee up front and a $1 per scooter fee per day. In Raleigh, North Carolina, Bird added a $2 transportation fee on top of its $1 unlock fee after the City Council implemented a $300 per scooter fee. Bird says it is making the price changes transparent to riders prior to them initiating a ride. When riders open the app, theyll see a message about updated pricing information and will be asked to acknowledge the change to unlock a scooter. The price updates come as scooters begin to return to some cities in force after disappearing for the winter. And the scooter sharing companies are beginning to roll out more durable, longer-lasting versions of their scooters that are supposed to improve their ability to stay in service longer. Those scooters are more expensive to manufacture and operate, though, which necessitates some price adjustment for consumers. The unit economics of the scooter-sharing business is overall pretty terrible. Quartz crunched the numbers from Louisville, Kentucky, and found the average lifespan of a scooter was only 28.8 days, doing an average of three and a half rides per day. At these rates, Bird only recoups $67 on the cost of the average scooter in other words, it loses a whopping $293 per scooter. And thats not even factoring a host of other costs, like taxes and fees. Bird disputes these numbers. Other scooter companies are likely to raise their prices in response to Bird, though the major ride-hailing companies that also operate scooters, like Uber and Lyft, can probably afford to delay those changes in order to poach riders from Bird and Lime.'},\n",

The upper end of the target range will put Pinterest at just $11.3 billion. The social network\\'s public offering follows ride-hailing start-up Lyft \\'s debut less than two weeks ago. It was not smooth sailing for Lyft as its shares went downhill after the initial pop and are still trading below the IPO price. More of the so-called unicorns, privately financed companies valued at more than $1 billion, are slated to go public this year, including Uber, Airbnb, Slack and Postmates.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'PG&amp;E Corp. stocks downward slide has continued this year, and while the dust may be beginning to clear on where the utility stands in terms of recent wildfires, Morgan Stanley warns that potential liabilities for future outbreaks are the next worry for shareholders. The back story. PG&amp;E is down 20% this year and has tumbled nearly 58% in the past 12 months. Claims against the utility in connection with Californias 2017-2018 seriesof deadly wildfires have forced it to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The outlook for the stock isnt as dire as it once was, and the shares got a boost on the appointment of a new CEO last week (as activists clamored for leadership changes ). Yet the company had to suspend its dividend, critics remain, and Barrons has warned of the risks of trading PG&amp;E. One of the biggest reason not to own the stock is uncertainty about what future wildfires may bring. While a wet winter may help to prevent a repeat of last years disaster, wildfires are unlikely to disappear from the California landscape, and lawmakers may not be eager to help utilities pass on the costs of future incidents beyond current legislation. In addition, the state has an inverse condemnation law, which means that companies can be on the hook for fires started by their equipment, even if they arent found to be negligent. That is less of a concern for PG&amp;E at the moment because it has been established that its equipment didnt cause the 2017 Tubbs Fire, but it could be a problem in the future. Whats new. On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley s Stephen Byrd took a look at how the liability question could affect both PG&amp;E and Edison International (EIX). He examined options that California could take in regard to future fireseverything from stress tests to an insurance fund, built up via surcharges utilities could charge customers, that could cover fire-related costs in cases where a utility isnt found to be negligent. Late last week, the California Public Utilities Commission proposed a version of a stress test that would examine utilitiess ability to weather a heavy financial blow. Byrd notes that the investor response has been largely positive. The plan seeks to make sure utilities can help pay for fire damage without having their debt downgraded to junk, making it harder for them to raise funds. Looking Ahead. Byrd believes that a stress test could soothe some investors nerves. If the test made clear the amount of new debt a utility could have to take out in the event of a fire, shareholders could just deduct that risk from the utilities earnings, arriving at a discounted multiple for the shares. Yet all this is conjecture at the moment. A legislative blueprint is due out from the governors office later this week Byrd says he thinks the plan will include a very large statewide insurance fund, which investors would probably like. With a fund potentially large enough to cover wildfire damages of up to $75 billion the market may be somewhat comforted by such a large amount of protection from future damages, he wrote. The analyst reiterated an Equal Weight rating and $17.50 price target on PG&amp;E, writing that even a large insurance fund would, on its own, be insufficient to incentivize institutional investors to provide badly needed capital to PG&amp;E in the future. PG&amp;E was down 3.5% to $18.99 near midday. Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com'},\n",

However, he believes it ultimately creates a much smoother path to the stock market debut. On the political side, the bond sale shows that investors will not be detracted by the Khashoggi killing, he said. Just six months ago, the conventional wisdom was that the incident left Saudi Arabia with little political capital and the kingdom would have to keep oil prices low to appease the Trump administration, Bradley noted. Instead, Saudi Arabia has slashed its output this year, helping to boost benchmark oil prices by 30-40% this year and reassuring investors of its influence over the market. The public disclosures in the bond prospectus have also put to bed some \"nagging questions,\" removing an element of uncertainty. \"I personally think the public disclosures make the IPO much easier to float because a lot of info has been revealed which will help in the range of pricing when the deal is floated,\" Bradley said in an email. \"Bottom-line, the massively oversubscribed Aramco bond deal (way exceeded the most wild expectations) bodes well for the success of an eventual Aramco equity IPO.\"'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Carlos Ghosn loses his place on Nissans board of directors and claims hes the victim of a conspiracy, Tesla cuts sales staff, Fiat Chrysler pays $110 million to settle investor lawsuit over emissions, and Elon Musks tweets. All of this and more in The Morning Shift for Tuesday, April 9, 2019. 1st Gear: Carlos Ghosn Says Hes the Victim Here Former Renault CEO and Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was originally arrested over allegations of financial misconduct from Nissan in November and has been arrested multiple times since, released a video statement on Tuesday in regards to the allegations against him. The claims against Ghosn have built since the original arrest, and include allegations of underreporting $90 million in compensation and putting personal financial losses on Nissan. He might have even had Renault pay $57,000 toward his wedding, according to reports from earlier this year. The Tuesday statement was on video and not in person, Ghosn said, because he couldnt make the press conference he scheduled. Ghosn was arrested for the fourth time last week, the BBC reports. If you are listening to me through this video today, it means that I was not able to make the press conference that I planned for April 11, Ghosn starts the video with, in an opening clip very reminiscent of the typical If youre reading this, theyve got me movie scene. Ghosn went on to say hes innocent of all charges and all accusations around the charges, and that theyre biased, taken out of context and twisted. He then goes through some of the charges, and says he still has an untainted love for both Japan and Nissan. The third point I want to tell you is that this is a conspiracy, Ghosn said. This is not about specific events. This is not about, again, greed, this is not about dictatorship. This is about a plot. This is about conspiracy. This is about backstabbing. Ghosn said the reasons for this were fear over the next steps in the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, and how further integrating with Renault could threaten certain peopleexecutives, he clarifiedand the autonomy of Nissan as a company. His biggest wish, he said, is to have a fair trial. The full YouTube video wont embed, but can be seen here. 2nd Gear: Carlos Ghosn Voted Out as Nissan Director Reuters reports that Carlos Ghosns last tie with Nissan is now cut, after Nissan shareholders voted him out as a director on Monday. Ghosn was voted out a few days after his most recent arrest in Tokyo, according to Reuters. The allegations of financial misconduct against Ghosn and the aftermath they could cause led to an interesting first shareholder meeting since his first arrest, according to Reuters descriptionsincluding a near record 4,100 shareholders in attendance and the occasional interruption from hecklers. In the meeting, the shareholders voted to remove both Ghosn and Greg Kelly, who was also accused of reporting compensation numbers that were less than the actual amount, from Nissans board of directors. Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard was voted in. From the story: [S]hareholders gathered for an extraordinary meeting, expressing bafflement and disquiet about growing allegations of financial misconduct laid out before them - while seeking more clarity on how Nissan plans to recover from the scandal. Meeting shareholders for the first time since Ghosns initial arrest in November, Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa and Jean-Dominique Senard, the chairman of its alliance partner Renault, said they needed to focus on collaboration and improving governance at the Japanese company. But they offered few concrete details about the way forward. Reuters reports that both Kelly and Ghosn have denied the accusations, and that Ghosn said hes the victim of a boardroom coupas you might already know. 3rd Gear: Tesla Cuts Dozens of Sales Staff Tesla might not be fully going online, laying people off and closing its stores, but Bloomberg reports that a few dozen sales staff did get cut on Thursday. The story said the company cut staff in Chicago, New York and Florida, citing people familiar with the matter. The cuts from Thursday were on people known as inside sales, Bloomberg reports, which is the job of reaching out to potential customers and inviting them on test drives. From the story: After the retail strategy revamp, these employees were reassigned to tasks such as taking inbound calls, helping with deliveries and even washing and detailing vehicles, the people said. Tesla still has operations at the three locations, including employees who can field customer questions and support car owners, according to the company. It still has inside sales teams in Fremont, California, and Las Vegas, the people said. One impacted employee in Tampa, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that 20 inside sales advisers and two managers were informed around noon Thursday that their positions there were being eliminated. Another employee who worked in Brooklyn said the team there was also informed Thursday. Both said the teams were informed of the terminations via conference call and that it was effective immediately. Bloomberg reports that Tesla confirmed the cuts but declined to talk about specifics, including the number of people involved. 4th Gear: Fiat Chrysler Pays $110 Million in Investor Lawsuit Over Emissions Fiat Chrysler will pay $110 million to settle a lawsuit from investors claiming the company misled them over all of those cheating diesel emissions, Reuters reports, citing court records. Investors sued in 2015, according to Reuters. In a statement on Monday, the company said it continues to vigorously deny the allegations of wrongdoing made in this lawsuit and said the settlement is covered by the companys insurance. In 2015, Fiat Chrysler settled allegations with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it failed to properly complete 23 recalls affecting more than 11 million vehicles. It paid a $105 million U.S. penalty, conducted additional recalls and agreed to buy back hundreds of thousands of vehicles. The securities suit also raised claims Fiat Chrysler misled investors over the Justice Departments allegations it used defeat devices to allow diesel-powered vehicles to emit excess emissions. In January, Fiat Chrysler agreed to an $800 million settlement to resolve claims by the U.S. Justice Department and the state of California that it used illegal software to produce false results on diesel-emissions tests. The lawsuit covers investors who bought Fiat Chrysler stock on a U.S. exchange between Oct. 13, 2014 and May 23, 2017. Lawyers for the investors estimated in a court filing that the settlement is equal to 13.8 percent of maximum damages, calling it an objectively excellent result when compared to historical statistics in class action settlements. The settlement still has to be approved by a federal judge in New York, Reuters reports. 5th Gear: Elons Tweets Elon Musk just kind of, well, tweets, even when he shouldnt or when hes not really supposed to. And if you ever wanted to think more about Musks tweets than you already dowhich, honestly, is not recommended Bloomberg analyzed his Twitter habits. Heres the main idea, via Bloomberg: When Elon Musk was accused earlier this year of violating a months-old agreement that he clear material tweets about Tesla Inc. with a company lawyer, the billionaire told a federal judge he took his accord with the Securities and Exchange Commission seriously, and that he had dramatically reduced his postings about the electric-car maker. Then, he went back on a binge. Musk sent more Tesla-related tweets in March than any month since June, according to a Bloomberg News analysis of his activity on the social network. He began the month trying to placate customers irritated by price changes for Autopilot, Teslas driver-assistance system, and ended it with posts about the Semi truck hes eager for Tesla to start producing. The full story, and its analysis of Musks tweets, is here, should you dare. Reverse: Mark Twain Gets His Steamboat Pilots License Samuel Langhorne Clemens got his steamboat pilots license on April 9, 1859, according to History. Here was the deal: Clemens had signed on as a pilots apprentice in 1857 while on his way to Mississippi. He had been commissioned to write a series of comic travel letters for the Keokuk Daily Post, but after writing five, decided hed rather be a pilot than a writer. He piloted his own boats for two years, until the Civil War halted steamboat traffic. According to History, he picked up the term Mark Twain while a pilot, and when he returned to writing, began writing under that name. Neutral: Did Carlos Ghosn Convince You?

       "  'content': 'Monday, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analyst Stephen Tusa downgraded his future picture of the performance of the stock of General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE ). GE stock closed Monday at $9.49, down 5.2 percent from Friday. The low for the day, $9.15, down 8.6 percent. It should be noted that four months earlier Mr. Tusa had upgraded the stock, even though he had promoted a bearish view of the stock for a long time. Lot a lot of people, Mr. Tusa was modestly supportive of Larry Culp, the new GE chief executive officer, soon after he ascended into the top position at the company. Mt. Tusa\\'s comment on the change: \"We believe many investors are underestimating the severity of the challenges and underlying risks at GE, while overestimating the value of small positives.\" This comment represents the unease I have felt about Mr. Culp\\'s accession and the treatment of the task that was facing him. Mr. Culp has an outstanding resume. He seems to be a very intelligent and cohesive as a CEO. And, yet, something has been missing. Mr. Culp\\'s comments and presentations, in my mind, have been less than adequate for the period in which he must establish himself as the firm and confident leader one would want in this position at this time. His view of the future, to me, has been tepid and incomplete. It does not make one want to jump at the chance to be a part of the turnaround. At the top of Mr. Tusa\\'s list of concerns are the cash flow projections that analysts have been working with. Mr. Tusa \"sees Wall Street over-projecting GE\\'s cash flow in coming years with GE Capital needing more cash to cover ongoing problems in that financial-services division.\" Note that GE has warned the market that cash flow will be negative for 2019. However, Mr. Tusa appears to be adamant that cash flow levels are still being over estimated for the near future. Furthermore, GE has more than $100 billion in debt is a large exposure that will have to be faced, even if the economy does not \"sour.\" If these \"liquidity issues\" become a real issue to the company, especially if there is some kind of a recession, GE may be faced into \"a potentially dilutive sale of the rest of Healthcare.\" Putting forth these views had an important impact on the market, as I reported earlier in this post, and there is good reason for this according to Thomas Gryta of the Wall Street Journal, in the article cited above. Mr. Gryta writes, \"The analyst, Stephen Tusa, has been one of GE\\'s biggest skeptics and his investment calls have had outsize influence on GE\\'s shares.\" \"In December, Mr. Tusa upgraded GE but he kept much of his negative tone and his $6 price target even as the stock has rallied to above $10 under new Chief Executive Larry Culp.\" \"On Monday, Mr. Tusa lowered his rating to \"underweight\" and reduced his price target to $5 a share.\" Mr. Tusa has been negative on GE for quite some time now. He initially downgraded the company in May 2016, even before it was obvious that GE was facing some major financial problems. He was the first from a major firm to take this stance. Since then his concerns with the GE situation have been seen to be \"spot on.\" The title of this post is \"General Electric Can\\'t Catch A Break.\" Although not everything that has happened in recent months is GE\\'s fault, or Mr. Culp\\'s fault. General Electric is a large complex company. However, I cannot absent them from a substantial part of the string of unfortunate events that keep happening to them. This is where openness and full disclosure come into play. Part of the reason for the decline in General Electric was the failure of the company to be completely open and transparent to investors. Added to this is the fact that the Board of Directors allowed this hiddenness and opaqueness to go on far too long. They did little to uncover the situation or fulfill their responsibility for oversight of the CEO and senior management. The board must now become much more active and show that it is now willing and able to perform its function more completely. I have written another post on a very similar issue: \" Wells Fargo: A Case for Reconstructing the Role of Boards of Directors.\" Furthermore, the CEO, Mr. Culp, has a responsibility for presenting as full and as clear a picture of what he is doing and what he sees coming at GE in the future. In the three turnarounds that I (successfully) completed, I felt, if anything, that it was my responsibility to provide shareholdersand the marketmore information than they wanted. The reason for this is that, given the difficulty that goes with a turnaround, it is imperative for the owners and the investment community, to have every bit of information they might ever want. I wanted to err on the side of providing too much information, rather than too little. The problem now is that we are in the sixth month of Mr. Culp\\'s reign and it is my feeling that the questions and concerns that are being raised are not the ones that should be being raised. Something is missing and I am afraid that its absence is hurting Mr. Culp and will continue to hurt him in the near future. General Electric can\\'t seem to catch a break, but, they only seem to have themselves to blame.

       "  'content': 'Bitcoin (BTC) has run its course trading within an ascending triangle and will now have to break out. Needless to say, the majority of the crypto community expects the price to break above this ascending triangle. A lot of people seem to be completely unconcerned about the manner in which the price is growing. If it keeps moving sideways and then keeps pumping, most of them will not mind as long as it doesn’t begin to do the same thing in the other direction. However, that is the thing about pumps and dumps. There is a pump which is followed by a dump and the price reverts to its mean. The way in which BTC/USD has pumped the past few days is not sustainable in any way. The price is due for a sharp decline which is an eventuality that we are going to see sooner or later. There is no other way around it. That being said, we could see the price rise towards $5,500 or even $6,000 short term although that is very unlikely. It would also be very obvious as the majority of traders and investors are already expecting that. If something is this obvious, it rarely happens and markets have a way of surprising both bulls and bears at the same time. If Bitcoin (BTC) falls from current levels and breaks below the ascending triangle, it will have to settle atop the previous trend line support. This level could be easily broken and the price might plunge further into the red to trade in the $3,000s. A lot of traders assume that we are near the end of the bear market even though that would make the current cycle a lot shorter than the previous one. The price has closed below the 50 Week EMA, it is below the 21 Month EMA but it is hard to understand why traders are so eager to jump to conclusions. If anything, traders ought to be more bearish than bullish considering how overbought BTC/USD is on both the daily and weekly time frames. If we look at the RSI on the daily chart, it has come back to test the trend line support every time it has shot up. This means that no matter how high the price goes, it will still have to fall back to this very trend line support. This is why it is important note to chase the price but to let it come to you. The Stochastic RSI on the daily time frame is also extremely overbought and every time it has been this high, we have seen a reversion to mean. This time that reversion could mean a sharp decline below the 200 Day EMA which is going to unnerve a lot of traders and the panic selling we might see would be extraordinary. The reason I say it will be extraordinary is because very few people are prepared for that. Everybody is thinking this is the end and the price is going to shoot up in the next few weeks to begin a new cycle. When that hope bubble pops, it is not going to be a good day for a lot of retail traders.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Uber unveiled a new product Tuesday called Uber Vouchers thats designed to help businesses sponsor free or discounted ride-hail trips for their customers. Its the companys latest service aimed at growing the B2B (business-to-business) market, and the announcement comes right before Uber is expected to officially announce its public offering. Companies that already offer customers transportation such as shuttle services or rental cars, be it in the hospitality sector or in the insurance space, can now use Vouchers to offer Uber rides instead. Bars and restaurants can offer discounted designated driver rides to customers who have been drinking. Sports teams can bundle rides with other loyalty perks in an effort to encourage fans to make the trip to see the next game live. The new service is available in the majority of cities where Uber is present. Businesses can sign up for Vouchers by visiting uber.com/vouchers. Heres how it works, according to Uber: Companies can create customized Voucher campaigns and programs within a specified budget, set pick-up and drop-off locations, and an established time for an offer. All details can be tailored to an event, promotion or service. Businesses can send vouchers to their customers through email, social media and mobile messaging. Companies offering vouchers only pay for the rides redeemed under a campaign, plus any applicable administrative fees. When a rider redeems a Voucher, it is added automatically into the Payment section of the riders Uber app until it expires. Customers who receive a Voucher can apply it directly to their existing Uber account or will be prompted to download the app to redeem the discounted trip. A dedicated dashboard shows businesses how many Vouchers are redeemed and allows them to export anonymized trip information streamline reporting and billing. Ubers B2B team began beta testing Vouchers late last year across a diverse group of retailers, restaurants, and services, with over 100 global partners including TGI Fridays, Live Nation, the Golden State Warriors, MGM Resorts, Sprint, Freshworks, and European real estate developers Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield. Uber is now adding new partners, including Allstate, to broaden the program. While its core business remains focused on car service trips, Uber has rapidly expanded the number of B2B products it offers over the years. Uber Freight, the newly spun-out business unit that helps truck drivers connect with shipping companies, recently announced it was expanding into Europe. Uber Health is a digital tool to help health care providers book rides for patients who need assistance getting to and from their doctor appointments. And Uber Eats is a huge source of revenue for the money-losing ride-hail company, and recent data suggests its the fastest-growing meal-delivery service in the US.'},\n",

Ashland Ave. on the Near West Side near West Town’s border. The new spot, based on a collective business model, will be permanent production home to Burnt City Brewing, Around the Bend Beer Co. and Bold Dog Beer Co., with additional taps for guest brewers. District Brew Yards will also feature a beer hall with a cashless pour-your-own tap system and a retail area selling merchandise and freshly packaged beer. The Brew Yards idea is a “creative partnership” that embraces the “pioneering spirit upon which the craft beer industry was founded,” spokesperson Lacey Irby said in a press release. John Saller, head brewer of Burnt City Brewing, said The Brew Yards will help him get his beers into the hands of more people. This comes from our mixed-fermentation room and designated bottle filler, our ability to brew a huge range of batch sizesand then to put them all into cans and sell them in our package shopand the self-serve taps in the beer hall that allow our guests to sample a little bit of everything,” Saller said. The collective is opening in an area of Chicago that has become well-known for craft beer. A smattering of breweries can be found near this stretch of Ashland Avenue, including Goose Island Beer Co., Finch Beer Co., Great Central Brewing Co., All Rise Brewing Co. and On Tour Brewing Co.

       "  'content': 'Editor\\'s note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money\\'s newsletter. You can sign up here. It was only about 40 years ago that plastic bags became standard at U.S. grocery stores. This also made them standard in sewers, landfills, rivers and the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. They clog drains and cause floods, litter landscapes and kill wildlife. The national movement to get rid of them is gaining steam with more than 240 cities and counties passing laws that ban or tax them since 2007. New York recently became the second U.S. state to ban them. But these bans may be hurting the environment more than helping it. University of Sydney economist Rebecca Taylor started studying bag regulations because it seemed as though every time she moved for a new job from Washington, D.C., to California, to Australia bag restrictions were implemented shortly after. \"Yeah, these policies might be following me,\" she jokes. Taylor recently published a study of bag regulations in California. It\\'s a classic tale of unintended consequences. Paper or plastic? Before California banned plastic shopping bags statewide in late 2016, a wave of 139 Californian cities and counties implemented the policy themselves. Taylor and colleagues compared bag use in cities with bans to those without them. For six months, they spent weekends in grocery stores tallying the types of bags people carried out (she admits these weren\\'t her wildest weekends). She also analyzed these stores\\' sales data. Taylor found these bag bans did what they were supposed to do. People in the cities with the bans used fewer plastic bags, which led to about 40 million fewer pounds of plastic trash per year. But people who used to reuse their shopping bags for other purposes, like picking up dog poop or lining trash bins, still needed bags. \"What I found was that sales of garbage bags actually skyrocketed after plastic grocery bags were banned,\" she says. This was particularly the case for small, 4-gallon bags, which saw a 120 percent increase in sales after bans went into effect. Loading... Don\\'t see the graphic above? Click here. Trash bags are thick and use more plastic than typical shopping bags. \"So about 30 percent of the plastic that was eliminated by the ban comes back in the form of thicker garbage bags,\" Taylor says. On top of that, cities that banned plastic bags saw a surge in the use of paper bags, which she estimates resulted in about 80 million pounds of extra paper trash per year. Plastic haters, it\\'s time to brace yourselves. A bunch of studies find that paper bags are actually worse for the environment. They require cutting down and processing trees, which involves lots of water, toxic chemicals, fuel and heavy machinery. While paper is biodegradable and avoids some of the problems of plastic, Taylor says, the huge increase of paper, together with the uptick in plastic trash bags, means banning plastic shopping bags increases greenhouse gas emissions. That said, these bans do reduce nonbiodegradable litter. Are tote bags killing us? What about reusable cloth bags? We know die-hard public radio fans love them! They\\'ve got to be great, right? Nope. They can be even worse. A 2011 study by the U.K. government found a person would have to reuse their cotton tote bag 131 times before it was better for climate change than using a plastic grocery bag once. The Danish government recently did a study that took into account environmental impacts beyond simply greenhouse gas emissions, including water use, damage to ecosystems and air pollution. These factors make cloth bags even worse. They estimate you would have to use an organic cotton bag 20,000 times more than a plastic grocery bag to make using it better for the environment. That said, the Danish government\\'s estimate doesn\\'t take into account the effects of bags littering land and sea, where plastic is clearly the worst offender. Stop depressing me. What should we do? The most environment-friendly way to carry groceries is to use the same bag over and over again. According to the Danish study, the best reusable ones are made from polyester or plastics like polypropylene. Those still have to be used dozens and dozens of times to be greener than plastic grocery bags, which have the smallest carbon footprint for a single use. As for bag policies, Taylor says a fee is smarter than a ban. She has a second paper showing a small fee for bags is just as effective as a ban when it comes to encouraging use of reusable bags. But a fee offers flexibility for people who reuse plastic bags for garbage disposal or dog walking. Taylor believes the recent legislation passed in New York is a bad version of the policy. It bans only plastic bags and gives free rein to using paper ones ( counties have the option to impose a 5-cent fee on them). Taylor is concerned this will drive up paper use. The best policy, Taylor says, imposes a fee on both paper and plastic bags and encourages reuse. This bag research makes public radio\\'s love for tote bags awkward, doesn\\'t it? It might be weird though if we started giving out plastic grocery bags. Did you enjoy this newsletter? Well, it looks even better in your inbox! You can sign up here.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Dow Jones futures fell slightly early Tuesday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. After the close, the FDA rejected a Zogenix ( ZGNX ) drug for a rare form of epilepsy, good news for GW Pharma ( GWPH ). Meanwhile, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to a PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals ( PHAS ) compound. The FDA also OK'd a Bio-Rad Laboratories ( BIO ) blood typing and screening system. Zogenix stock plunged after hours, while GW Pharma stock and PhaseBio stock rallied. Bio-Rad stock was quiet overnight. X Dow Jones Futures Today Dow Jones futures fell 0.1% vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.1% below fair value. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session. Current Stock Market Rally The Dow Jones fell 0.3% on Monday, dragged down by Boeing ( BA ), even as Apple ( AAPL ) broke out. The Nasdaq composite rallied for a 0.2% gain and the S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.1%. All three major indexes are about 2% from their all-time highs as the current rally is on the cusp of a l ong bull market phase. Apple's low-volume breakout wasn't especially inspiring but shares rose slightly in the premarket, providing some support for the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq. Zogenix Stock Pained, GW Pharma Gains The FDA late Monday refused to review Zogenix's Fintepla for treating Dravet, a rare form of epilepsy. Zogenix stock plunged 29% early Tuesday. Zogenix stock had tried to break out past a 55.10 cup-with-handle buy point on March 29 and April 1, but never closed above the entry. Meanwhile, GW Pharma stock climbed 4.4% before the open. Shares are working on a 182.33 buy point from a short flat base after breaking out from a wild, very deep cup with handle following earnings in late February. GW Pharma sells Epidiolex, a cannabinoid-based drug, to treat Dravet and other types of childhood epilepsy. The FDA approved it last June. PhaseBio Stock Jumps The FDA declared PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals' PB2452 a Breakthrough Therapy, giving the compound a better path for approval. The PhaseBio compound is a reversal agent for AstraZeneca 's ( AZN ) anti-clotting medicine, Brilinta. PhaseBio stock surged 33% early. Shares shot up 17% to 12.57 in Monday's stock market, hitting a new closing high. PhaseBio stock came public at 5 a share in October, fell to 2.55 in November but has been on a tear since March 12. Bio-Rad Stock Near Buy Point The FDA OK'd a Bio-Rad Laboratories system for blood typing and screening for small to midsize labs. Bio-Rad stock was not trading overnight. Shares rose 0.4% Monday to 309.84. Bio-Rad stock is working on a 324.04 cup-with-handle buy point. How To Play Biotech Sector Individual biotech stocks are subject to sudden spikes on news. One way to minimize stock-specific risk is via ETFs. Among the best ETFs for biotechs, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF ( IBB ) is near a buy point. The SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF ( XBI ) is just above an entry. Please follow Ed Carson on Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.

       "  'content': 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state officials told food growers and processors in mid-December that they had the state’s blessing to produce and sell tea and chocolates laced with CBD, the cannabis derivative reputed to ease anxiety and other ills without marijuana’s high. But since then, New York City health inspectors have seized thousands of dollars worth of CBD-infused food and drinks at the Fat Cat Kitchen and other local cafes and restaurants, and warned owners to stop selling them or face penalties. The crackdown came just weeks after federal law explicitly made CBD legal across the country. The New York City crackdown highlights the inconsistencies that have emerged in federal, state and local rules governing CBD, bewildering the small but growing number of businesses selling edibles in New York and other states. “I’m trying to be compliant with the law, but no one seems to be fully aware of what the law is and isn’t,” said C.J. Holm, the owner of the Fat Cat Kitchen, which touts CBD coffee and cookies on a sidewalk chalkboard. Consumer interest in CBD tinctures, topical creams and edibles has grown in recent years in step with the piecemeal legalization of marijuana, which is now permitted as either a medical or recreational drug in 33 states while still banned by the federal government. In 2018, U.S. consumers spent an estimated $300 million on CBD food and drinks, according to a report by Cowen Washington Research Group. The Coca-Cola Company and other food giants have expressed interest in the sector. The 2018 Farm Bill, enacted in December, was intended in part to clear up the legal status of CBD by legalizing cannabis extracts derived from strains of the plant, known as hemp, that contain very low concentrations of THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana. But the law also created new confusion for businesses wanting to sell CBD food or drink. For some, it is impossible to follow one set of regulations without being in breach of another. In New York, for example, officials at the state Department of Agriculture issued guidance in December saying it was legal to sell “CBD tea,” “chocolates with CBD drizzle” and other CBD edibles, so long as the products are made and marketed as dietary supplements, which are governed by more stringent standards than ordinary food. But the department also warns that doing this will run afoul of rules issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which said it was unlawful to add CBD to food or to market it as a dietary supplement. That is because the agency, for the first time last year, had approved a drug that contained CBD as the active ingredient. New York City health inspectors have taken the FDA rule seriously. At the Fat Cat Kitchen, Holm was startled when a health inspector impounded her CBD powder, honey, snacks and raw cookie dough in February. Similar scenes played out at four other eateries in the city. Soon afterward, Holm and other restaurateurs received a letter from the department saying inspectors would resume the seizures after July 1. It is unclear whether the city’s Health Department will allow cafes and restaurants to sell CBD edibles even as a dietary supplement, despite New York state officials saying such products are legal. When asked, Michael Lanza, a Health Department spokesman, repeated the department’s position that it is following the FDA ban on CBD food and drink in any form. An FDA spokesman declined to comment on New York’s regulations. Colorado, Maine and other states have attempted to clarify the status of CBD-laced edibles by passing laws allowing the addition of CBD to food. The FDA has said it may make an exception for CBD, allowing it as a food additive or dietary supplement even though it is now a listed drug. It will hold a public forum on the issue in Maryland on May 31. With the conflicting rules and at best haphazard enforcement, Holm and other CBD vendors say they are pressing ahead, devising their own strategies that they feel are at least a gesture toward compliance. Igor Yakovlev, who stirs CBD into honey on New York’s Staten Island, prints a disclaimer on each Beezy Beez Honey jar stating that the FDA has not “evaluated or approved” his product. Holm, in consultation with a lawyer, noted that the FDA bans CBD being added to food for “interstate commerce,” and reasons she is fine to sell CBD coffee so long as the extract is produced and processed in New York. “It is so confusing because you can ask three different attorneys and get three different answers,” said Allan Gandelman, a farmer in Cortland who founded the New York Cannabis Growers and Processors Association earlier this year. “So you decide you’re going to blaze a path forward, and produce a product that customers really want, and go for it until the government gets its act together.” Reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; Editing by Frank McGurty and Dan Grebler'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Washing machines, dryers and other appliances are seen for sale at a Lowe\\'s home improvement store in Washington, D.C., Sept. 27, 2018. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images It was a daunting task. Amid a major renovation, Jani Mussetter needed a lot of appliances: a washer, dryer, refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher and stove. As she visited showrooms in January, a stressful thing kept coming up: warnings of a price increase on Feb. 1. For Mussetter, shopping for higher end appliances, that potentially meant paying hundreds of dollars more. And why? \"They said, because of all the tariffs,\" the San Francisco resident says. Tariffs and the trade war have been in the news for more than a year, since President Trump began imposing higher taxes on various imported products and materials. For regular American shoppers, major household appliances perfectly illustrate the complicated reality of the trade dispute. One tariff was a boon to some domestic manufacturers. But other tariffs hiked costs for the entire industry worldwide. Prices on appliances are now slowly recovering from their biggest increase in about five years. Whirlpool\\'s gamble Whirlpool, a leading American appliance maker, is at the heart of the issue. Its prices had barely changed for many years, says G.research housing analyst Alvaro Lacayo. Then, in 2018, he says, \"you saw a big tick upward.\" At first, higher prices were welcome news for Whirlpool. They reflected the company\\'s victory over its two main foreign competitors, South Korea\\'s LG and Samsung. Whirlpool which also own Maytag, Jenn-Air and other brands had spent years arguing that LG and Samsung had been \"dumping appliances into the U.S. market at below cost, rendering competition irrational,\" as Lacayo put it. In January 2018, President Trump agreed with Whirlpool. He set a new tariff, or tax, on imported washing machines, starting at 20 percent. So, selling washers to Americans became more expensive for foreign companies. And domestic manufacturers like Whirlpool could finally raise prices. But then, Trump imposed more tariffs, on metals including aluminum and steel. Steel, in particular, is critical to building almost any appliance. Suddenly, appliance makers everywhere, including Whirlpool, began complaining about the rising cost of raw materials. They had little choice but to start raising their own prices. \"Global steel costs have risen substantially and, particularly in the U.S., they have reached unexplainable levels,\" Whirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer said during an analyst call in July 2018. What happens next Steve Sheinkopf owns Yale Appliance &amp; Lighting in the Boston area, and he\\'s a third-generation owner. \"We have been here for almost 100 years now, it\\'s hard to believe,\" he says. Many brands Sheinkopf works with like Wisconsin-based Sub-Zero and Wolf or Germany\\'s Thermador regularly inch up their prices, he says, but the increases in the past year have been bigger than most. Sheinkopf predicts that appliance prices are probably stabilized at this point, at least for a while. But for shoppers who chase sales and specials, he says, promotions haven\\'t been as good as they used to be three to four years ago. Overall, prices of major appliances tracked by the consumer price index are starting to tick down month-to-month. But they are still higher than they were last year. \"On certain products, you could be looking at a 14- to 16-percent increase from last year to this year,\" Sheinkopf says. \"When you talk about [washing] machines that people want to buy, front-loaders, I think you\\'re looking at $200 to $400 difference versus last year.\" Many companies stretched some of the price increases into early 2019, still citing high costs of raw materials as well as changes in the currency market and labor costs. That\\'s what Mussetter experienced as she rushed to buy appliances for her remodel before Feb. 1. \"I\\'d be really bummed if I was walking in today,\" she says with a laugh. Mussetter did manage to buy all her appliances ahead of the price jump. Later, she learned this saved her $1,250. And one other thing happened last year, Whirlpool\\'s Korean competitors, LG and Samsung, fast-tracked new manufacturing plants in America. It\\'s great news for American jobs. But for Whirlpool? \"I think this is the biggest challenge they\\'ll ever have,\" Sheinkopf says.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Pinterest set the terms of its IPO on Monday, revealing a price range that could see the company debut on the public markets with an initial market cap below its last private valuation. The social content company has set a price range of $15 to $17 per share, which at the midpoint of the range would raise about $1.2 billion and give Pinterest an initial market cap of $8.5 billion—a sizable plunge from the $12.3 billion valuation it reached in 2017 with its most recent funding round and setting it apart from the rumors of skyrocketing valuations that have marked the wave of public offerings sweeping the tech industry. It is rare for a VC-backed unicorn to go public while slashing its worth. Since the start of 2010, the median valuation step-up for billion-dollar-plus VC exits over their last private valuation has remained above 1.8x, with only five of these unicorn exits during that period being down valuations, according to a recent PitchBook analyst note. If Pinterest were to go public with a share price around its projected range, it will join companies such as content management business Box and payment platform Square in the list of unicorns that were marked by a down valuation at the time of their exit. Investors have been grappling with Lyft 's dwindling stock price since it went public last month. The ridehailing unicorn's rocky IPO reception combined with Pinterest's discouraging initial pricing has raised questions around whether lofty private market valuations will be validated by investors in the public markets. As Pinterest prepares to go public in what could be a historic down exit, we've put together an interactive datagraphic to visualize the numbers surrounding the high-profile IPO.

Spokesman for the authority, Peter Gibson, said there are many areas in Canberra where drones are unable to be flown. \"This infringement should remind people not to fly drones within 5.5 kilometres from airports,\" Mr Gibson said. \"It\\'s dangerous and there can be serious consequences.\" The 5.5 kilometre limit means drone users aren\\'t able to fly near many of Canberra landmarks, including the War Memorial, Parliament House or the National Gallery. Drones are also restricted from flying more than 120 metres in the air or within 30 metres of people unless the person is essential to controlling the drone. AFP airport police commander for Canberra, Simon Henry, said the Mount Ainslie incident should serve as a warning for other drone users to know where they are flying. \"Flying drones in controlled airspace puts the safety of both Canberrans and our visitors at risk, and can lead to significant delays for travellers,\" Mr Henry said. \"It is your responsibility to know where you can and can\\'t fly, so please become familiar with the information and tools available to you.\" The NSW man was charged with flying a drone in restricted airspace in Canberra.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Bruce Deifik, who personally lost over $70 million on the Ocean Resort Casino in Atlantic City, NJ, died in a car crash in Denver on Sunday. He was 64. Deifik was driving home from a Colorado Rockies game when he was killed in the single-car crash, his lawyer told the Associated Press. He was also facing a hearing Wednesday in Atlantic City concerning whether he would lose his casino license over allegations of sexual harassment by female employees. The property is cursed, and Bruce was the latest victim, one insider told me. First he lost all his [investment]. Then he lost his life. The original owners went bankrupt after spending $2.4 billion developing the casino. Deifik, who had never been to Atlantic City, thought it was a bargain at about $200 million. But when Deifik renamed and reopened it in 2018, Ocean Resort Casino ranked dead last in gambling revenue among the nine casinos in town. Even after he sold it in January to Luxor Capital, Deifik was still being sued for $10 million by nightclub operator Joey Morrissey, who was forced out last year. As I reported in November, the presidential suite on the 44th floor, where Deifik and his wife, Nancy, often stayed, was hit by cat burglars who allegedly made off with nearly $1 million in jewelry. A spokesperson for the property said, The Ocean family is grateful for Bruce having the vision to reopen this beautiful oceanfront property and employing over 3,000 members of our community. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'It’s not just OPEC production cuts, Venezuelan chaos, and sanctions that are pushing up oil prices this year--U.S. shale production is slowing, too. And the result is a phenomenal 30-percent rally in WTI Crude prices in the first quarter, with the U.S. benchmark jumping from as low as $45 a barrel in early January to as high as $60 at the end of March. These improving supply fundamentals, including waning concerns over global economic and oil demand growth, have led to oil’s best quarterly performance in a decade. But the key driver has been slowing growth in the U.S. shale patch in response to the 40-percent slump in prices in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to a note from John LaForge, Head of Real Asset Strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. While Saudi Arabia is the “swing” producer, managing the market by deliberately withholding or increasing production regardless of price, the U.S. is the world’s marginal oil producer—the country pumping what the industry refers to as the extra barrel of oil—so shale breakeven prices are key to determining global oil prices, LaForge says. But U.S. oil production growth is now slowing, with average daily U.S. crude oil production slipping in January from the previous month for the first time in nearly six months, according to the EIA’s report from end-March. And it’s in the margins that we should be looking. “Commodity prices are often set on the margin, which means that they are set by the country that is producing that extra barrel of oil, ounce of gold, or pound of copper. In the case of oil, the U.S. is producing that extra barrel of oil for the world to consume,” LaForge notes. Related: Shale Is In A Deep State Of Flux “The 2019 oil-price rally is a direct reaction to the potential for future U.S. production growth to slow,” according to Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which has a $65 a barrel year-end 2019 price target for WTI. Referring to the breakeven prices at the world’s marginal oil producer, LaForge said: “The mid-$40s is the point at which the average U.S. shale producer starts seriously questioning (curtailing) its future drilling plans—and this is precisely what happened at the end of 2018.” Shale producers tend to agree with that view. According to the Q1 Dallas Fed Energy Survey, with executives from 82 E&amp;P firms chiming in, average breakeven prices to profitably drill a new well range from $48 to $54 per barrel, depending on the region. Drillers need $50 a barrel on average to profitably drill a new well, down from $52 per barrel when the same question was asked last year. Average breakeven prices in Midland in the Permian were $48, the lowest-cost in the U.S., and the lowest-cost region in the past three years. “With the recent recovery in oil prices, the majority of firms in the survey can profitably drill a new well at current prices; 78 percent of responses were at or below the March 22 WTI spot price ($59 per barrel),” the survey showed. Related: Aramco’s Mega Debt Deal Is A Raging Success However, the Q1 rally from $45 to $60 has been significant, so looking forward, the higher WTI prices will likely result in extra U.S. oil production in the coming months, setting the stage for more supply on the global market, Wells Fargo Investment Institute’s LaForge said. “The next short-term oil move may be down, probably into the low-to-mid $50s. Later in the year, though, we suspect that WTI will make a run at $65 as geopolitical tensions heat up among oil-related countries,” he noted. Later this year, oil prices will be driven by a combination of many factors, including, but not limited to, the pace of U.S. production growth. The tightening U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, the upcoming U.S. waivers decision for Iranian oil buyers, OPEC’s next production policy move, and geopolitical flare-ups such as those in Algeria and Libya will influence the supply side of the oil market. Global economy and trade issues will determine how resilient (or not) oil demand growth will be this year. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:'},\n",

       "  'content': 'THE FORMER FBI AGENT who headed up Wynn Resorts security operation no longer has a job at the international casino business four days after telling regulators he spied on employees and the ex-wife of the companys founder. The casino company, which plans to open an Everett resort in June, has been under scrutiny since a January 2018 Wall Street Journal story reported on multiple allegations of sexual harassment and worse against founder Steve Wynn, who resigned soon after the story was published. As the Massachusetts Gaming Commission attempted to determine whether Wynn Resorts should keep its casino license, the companys security chief, James Stern, acknowledged that he covertly surveilled Elaine Wynn and also spied on others, including one of the sources for the newspaper story. According to a legal brief filed with the Gaming Commission on Monday, Matt Maddox, the CEO of Wynn Resorts, contacted Stern on Saturday and told him his services were no longer needed. The filing also said “no surveillance will be conducted of employees or third parties without the permission of the chief global compliance officer and the general counsel or other in-house counsel to whom she delegates responsibility.” Stern told the commission that he only surveilled Elaine Wynn when she was in the company of Kazuo Okada, a Wynn Resorts investor who Stern claimed had organized crime connections, but a spokeswoman for Elaine Wynn later said she has never met with Okada.The 49-page legal brief, which described the dismissal of Stern as a “remedial measure,” argued that Wynn Resorts should retain its casino license in Massachusetts and that no action be taken against Maddox, who faced hard grilling from several commissioners during a three-day hearing last week. The hard questions focused on Maddox’s lackluster initial response to the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Steve Wynn, “Mr. Maddoxs initial response was based on his utter disbelief that Mr. Wynn engaged in such egregious conduct. Mr. Maddoxs immediate actions reflected that belief, but his subsequent actions are clear and convincing evidence that his suitability determination should not be disturbed,” the legal brief says. “To be clear, there is absolutely no evidence that Mr. Maddox was aware of any of the allegations of sexual misconduct at the time that they were made to other executives. No one has testified (or even suggested) that Mr. Maddox was aware of those allegationsnot one email or other piece of evidence exists to show that he was advised of those allegations, and he has twice testified under oath that he was not aware of them. That other executives knew and failed to advise Mr. Maddox is their failure, not his.”'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The former Gawker Media properties now known as Gizmodo Media Group have another new owner. Univision acquired those properties (including Gizmodo, Jalopnik, Jezebel, Deadspin, Lifehacker, and Kotaku) for $135 million in the Gawker bankruptcy auction (following the Hulk Hogan lawsuit) back in August 2016, but indicated last summer that they were exploring selling those sites, as well as The Onion, The A.V. Club, The Root, and others. And now, as Benjamin Mullen of The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, those properties have been acquired by private equity firm Great Hill Partners for “much less” than Univision paid. As Todd Spangler writes at Variety, this signals a change in approach for Univision: With the sale, Great Hill will form a new company called G/O Media Inc., headed by digital content industry vet Jim Spanfeller, who also will be a significant investor in the company. The sale puts an end to Univisions bid under then-CEO Randy Falco to diversify beyond its Hispanic broadcasting core business into what it had hoped would be a fast-growing, young-skewing mass digital play. …Univision had said last summer that it was looking to offload the digital-media assets. With the exit by Falco and appointment of TV veteran Vince Sadusky as Univisions CEO, the company decided to full return to its focus on Hispanic media and marketing. Our aim from the outset of this process was to sell these assets as one, Sadusky said in a statement. We are pleased to have found a terrific buyer in Great Hill Partners that is committed to growing these properties. What will that mean for these sites? Well, Spangler writes that Univision said the Gizmodo Media Group and Onion sites will continue to operate as “independent assets within the Great Hill Partners portfolio,” and that “all employees of GMG and The Onion will be joining G/O Media.” That doesn’t mean there won’t be layoffs following the acquisition, though. And it will be interesting to see what Spanfeller does with these sites. His previous work includes time as president of Ziff Davis Enterprises consumer magazine group, publisher of Inc. Magazine, and associate publisher of Playboy Enterprises Publishing Group, a stint as the editor in chief of Forbes.com, work at PC Magazine and RealClearPolitics, and the creation of his own Spanfeller Media Group (including The Daily Meal and The Active Times), which he sold to the then-Tronc in 2017. And an email he sent to Gizmodo Media Group staff this morning had a lot of buzzwords in it, as Madison Malone Kircher writes at NY Mag : Spanfeller sent an email to his notoriously independent new staff this morning, saying he looks forward to meeting everyone soon and answering their (likely many) questions. Including ones about editorial independence: While editorial independence is critically important, there needs to be a healthy and productive partnership with the business side for the company to be truly successful, Spanfeller wrote. Without an audience we have nothing to offer advertisers, eCommerce partners or subscription efforts. And without the revenue from those sources we have no way to fund the content and those who create it that attracts that audience in the first place. He also explained he wants to establish a new set of company values and laid out a rough draft of his ideas. Feel free to help make these better and perhaps more attuned to G/O Media. From Spanfellers email: · We are action oriented. When faced with an option of action vs. in-action, we always choose to DO SOMETHING. · We believe in our people. We respect our teammates. We know that if they do something they will, much more often than not, DO THE RIGHT THING. · We are ambitious. Both as a company and as individuals. We want our people to always be looking to take the next step up in everything they and we do. To BE GOAL ORIENTED. · We respect and value our customers. Without visitors, we would have no marketing partners, without marketing partners we could not serve our users. To protect both of these very important groups we do business WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF INTEGRITY. In how we deliver content and in how we conduct our day to day business activities. · We want our work environment to be one where people can BE PASSIONATE AND HAVE FUN. At any rate, it’s certainly notable to see the Gizmodo titles exit Univision for a new owner. The combined Gizmodo/Onion sites have 100 million unique visitors per month as per the company’s release, so they remain a significant player on the web. But the “much less” price than the $135 million Univision paid for the Gawker assets (not counting what they paid for their stake in the Onion sites) after almost a year of searching for a buyer illustrates the wider challenges out there in the digital publishing world. We’ll see what’s next for the Gizmodo titles. [ The Wall Street Journal ]'},\n",

The deal is expected to be completed in the second quarter, and CEC owner Apollo Capital Management LLC, which took Chuck E. Cheeses private and bought Peter Piper Pizza in separate 2014 deals, will retain 51% ownership in Leo Holdings, which plans to change its name to Chuck E.

The 750-unit CEC, which includes reported sales of $896 million in fiscal 2018. The boards of both Queso and Leo has approved the proposed deal, and Leo shareholders will vote on the plan. CEC has proven resiliency, said Lea Lyndon, chair and CEO of Leo Holdings and a founder of Lion Capital, in a webcast Monday. Its been around for 42 years. This is a very defensive play with very attractive cash characteristics. Lion Capital, which in February 2018 raised $200 million for the Leo Holdings SPAC, has invested in such foodservice brands as Round Table Pizza, Marble Slab Creamery, Great American Cookies, Gordon Ramsay restaurants and Wagamama. Apollos investment holdings include such foodservice brands as Qdoba, CKE Restaurants and Sprouts Farmers Market. Upon completion of the merger, Lyndon said he and Andy Jhawar, a senior partner at Apollo and head of its consumer and retail group, would serve as co-chairs of Chuck E. Cheese, and Tom Leverton, CEO of CEC for the past five years. Leverton, on Mondays call, said the company plans to increase the number of visits per year and boost spending through the All You Can Play platform. He said the company also is working to expand unit average unit volumes beyond the current $1.6 million with a 12% sales lift (to about $1.8 million) by extending the ongoing remodel program, which began in 2017 and added 25 more restaurants in 2018. CEC plans to reimage about 60 more locations this year. CEC also plans to expand its international development, which has 109 units abroad. Our first India location will open in 2019 or early 2020, Leverton said, providing us with a great gateway to Asia. CEC reported preliminary same-store sales increases of 7.7% in the first quarter, following a 3.3% increase in the fourth quarter and a 2.2% increase in the third quarter of 2018. CEC has 606 Chuck E. Cheeses units in 47 states and 14 countries. The company has 144 Peter Piper Pizza units in six states and Mexico.

They also removed Mr. Kelly, who is free on bail in Tokyo, from his seat on the board. Mr. Ghosns sudden fall plunged the auto-making alliance of Nissan and Renault into chaos. Mr. Ghosn led both companies and the alliance itself, and his arrest added tension to a relationship that already had begun to fray as Nissan struggled to assert independence from Renault. But in recent weeks, the group, which includes the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi, has pledged to redouble its efforts to work together. Renault is eager to move on and focus on the future business of the alliance. Tensions had blown up between it and Nissan after Mr. Ghosns arrest, as Nissan leaked allegations of his wrongdoing into the media. Renault and the French government, its biggest shareholder, responded bitterly and maintained a presumption of innocence toward Mr. Ghosn. But in recent months, Renaults own internal investigations began to turn up questionable use of company funds by Mr. Ghosn. These included a lavish Marie Antoinette-themed wedding party at Versailles, and payments to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman that are suspected of being used to help finance Mr. Ghosns yacht. Renault referred both findings to French prosecutors. In March, the companies announced the formation of a new operating board for the alliance, after discussions at Nissans headquarters in Yokohama aimed at creating a new path forward for the three automakers, with a greater voice for the junior Japanese partners. The board includes two representatives from Renault and one each from Nissan and Mitsubishi. Still, questions surrounding the imbalance in the alliances ownership structure remain. While Renault has argued that closer ties would help the companies work better together and share costs, some Nissan executives remain concerned that Renault, which holds a 43 percent stake in the Japanese automaker, would still wield greater power. Nissan owns a 15 percent nonvoting stake in the French automaker.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The growing appetite for plant-based meat is prompting a Chicago-area company to build a $310 million production facility in central Indiana that eventually will employ 460 people. Elmhurst -based Greenleaf Foods said Monday the plant would be built on a 57-acre site in Shelbyville, about 20 miles southeast of Indianapolis. Production at the 230,000-square-foot facility is expected to begin in late 2020. Greenleafs two plant-based brands Lightlife burgers, hotdogs and deli meat and Field Roast sausages and roasts are currently manufactured at opposite ends of the country in Seattle and Turners Falls, Mass. The expansion comes at a time when the plant-based meat substitute industry is growing like gangbusters. U.S. retail sales of plant-based foods that directly replace animal products have grown 17 percent in the past year to over $3.7 billion, according to data from the Good Food Institute. Greenleafs business is booming too, said President Dan Curtin. We are seeing a whole movement as people are looking for options for protein, Curtin said. The category is up 40 percent over last year and the first quarter this year we saw double-digit growth. We expect to see that in the future. The companys Elmhurst corporate offices have grown from three people to 40 people in the past year, Curtin said, and hes continuing to hire locally. The company said it considered Illinois during the early stages of the selection process before choosing Shelbyville. We had a whole matrix of different nuances we were looking at logistics, infrastructure, among other things, Curtin said. Based on all these things, Shelbyville made the most sense for us. Indiana provided roughly $50 million in government and utility grants and incentives, including $9.6 million toward capital and one-time start-up costs and roughly $40 million in 10-year operational support, according to Greenleaf. The incentives however, werent the main factor at all, Curtin said. Greenleafs newest product, the Lightlife Burger, will join a handful of plant-based burgers aimed at whetting the palates of not only vegans and vegetarians, but carnivores who crave the flavor and texture of real meat. Curtin said the product, derived from pea-based proteins, will launch locally in Jewel-Osco grocery stores later this month. Greenleaf says the plant will be North America's largest plant-based protein facility, annually producing 60 million pounds of refrigerated alternative protein products. An earlier version of this story described Greenleafs brands as vegetable-based. They are plant-based. The Associated Press contributed. crshropshire@chicagotribune.com Twitter @corilyns\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'Ever since Dec. 3, 2018, when the yield curve inverted (with the yield of 2.83% on the five-year Treasury note 1 basis point lower than the yield of 2.84% on the three-year Treasury note ), I have been receiving calls and emails from worried investors about the impact of an inverted yield curve. The reason they worry is the much-publicized relationship between inversions and recessionsinverted curves have predicted all nine U.S. recessions since 1955. You can observe the relationship in the following chart from WealthManagement.com, which shows the yield spread between two-year Treasury notes and 10-year Treasury notes during the most recent recessions (shaded in gray). Recent history shows that a recession follows yield curve inversion in an average of 16 months, and the setback lasts, peak to trough, for an average of 12 months. The question is, should you be worried about the inversion? Before tackling that issue, its worth noting that, on Dec. 3, 2018, the S&amp;P 500 Index closed at 2,790. On April 3, 2019 it closed at 2,873, a gain, not including dividends, of about 3%. Its also worth noting that, given concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth, on March 20, 2019, the Fed announced it does not expect to raise rates further this year. That said, should you be concerned, or acting, based on the recent inversion? Should You Care? To begin, it is important to understand that what matters is not just the relative level of interest rates, but whether the Feds policy is accommodative or contractionary. The reason we have experienced recessions after inversions is that Fed policy was contractionary as it tried to fight inflationary pressures. By raising real interest rates to levels sufficient to slow demand and fight inflation, the Fed can cause a recession. With this understanding, we should ask whether Fed policy is currently in a contractionary or accommodative regime. When it comes to monetary policy, it is the level of real interest rates, or the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate, that matters. On average, the real federal funds rate is positive. Over the last seven decades, it averaged about 1.3%. We fell well below that level in January 2008, when the Fed slashed rates to try to prevent a depression. The Fed has kept policy accommodative since then. The latest forecast from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphias Survey of Professional Forecasters is for inflation to be 2.0% in 2019. With the current three-month Treasury bill rate at 2.42%, we have a real three-month Treasury bill rate of just 0.42%, well below the historical average of 1.3%. Clearly, monetary policy is still accommodative and supportive of economic growth. As long as the real federal funds rate remains at relatively low levels and the nominal federal funds rate is basically flat relative to the five-year and 10-year Treasury notes, investors should temper any concern they have about an inversion in the yield curve. In addition to relatively loose monetary policy, we also have massively stimulative fiscal policy, with the budget deficit at about $1 trillion. That doesnt mean a recession isnt possible, as one can be caused by exogenous events, but it isnt going to be caused by monetary or fiscal policy that is too tight. Its also worth noting that while the curve inverted in December, the new claims for unemployment, at 202,000, just hit the lowest level since December 1969 (almost 50 years ago); employment rose 196,000 in March (producing a three-month average of 180,000); and average hourly wages for private-sector workers grew 3.2% from a year earlier ! Another reason you shouldnt focus on the slight inversion we have experienced relates to the fact that the flattening of the yield curve has mostly occurred at the longer end. While U.S. interest rates are well below historical levels, they are now well above those of most other developed countries. For example, the yield on 10-year U.K. gilts is just 1.08%. The yield on 10-year German bunds is slightly negative, at -0.01%. The yield on Japanese 10-year government bonds is also slightly negative, at -0.05%. Those low yields have led to the U.S. Treasury bond market attracting capital, suppressing our longer-term yields and flattening the curve. Normally, a flattening of the yield curve might signal the market is expecting weaker economic growth. However, today that flattening could just as likely be a result of safe-haven demand (capital flows to the U.S., as our economy is less likely to be negatively impacted by a trade war) and the global search for higher yields. Theres one other important point to remember: If the yield curve inverted further due to a weakening of the economy, it is likely that Fed policy would become even more accommodative, reducing the risks of a recession and a bear market. As the advice I offer is always based on the evidence, lets now turn to the evidence on stock returns following inversions. Stock Returns Following Yield Curve Inversions In an August 2018 article, What Does a Yield Curve Inversion Mean for Investors?, Dimensional Fund Advisors examined the returns to stocks following inversions for five major developed nations, including the U.S., since 1985. The article states: Equity returns (as measured by MSCI local currency indices) were a mixed bag in the three years following an inversion, with US index returns higher 66% of the time at the 12-month mark and only 33% of the time 36 months later. When all countries are included, returns of the indices were higher 86% of the time 12 months later and 71% of the time 36 months later. Dimensional concluded: It is difficult to predict the timing and direction of equity market moves following a yield curve inversion. My colleague, Jared Kizer, also took a look at returns following yield curve inversions. He examined inversions, defined as the spread between two- and five-year Treasuries, and found that the three years following one produced a total market beta premium of just under 3%, and the five years following one produced a total market beta premium of almost 11%. Jared also noted a very wide range of outcomes for the market beta premium over both horizons, but particularly for the five-year period. Among five-year periods, four results had negative total returns (although two of these overlap), with two of them being negative total returns in excess of 30% (the largest negative total premium was -42%). However, in some five-year periods, the total market beta premium was substantially positive, with a few results in excess of 50% (the largest was 69%). In other words, U.S. stock market returns have tended to be lower than their historical average, but still positive, following periods of yield curve inversion. The bottom line is that, while an inverted curve may be a reliable indicator that a recession is likely to begin, on average, within 16 months, it is not an indicator reliable enough to allow you to profitably time stock markets. That should not come as a surprise, as there is no evidence that active managers have been able to exploit any signal provided by well-publicized information on the predictive nature of yield curve inversions. If there were any evidence, we would see it in the annual S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices versus Active (SPIVA) scorecards. But none exists, in either the stock or bond market. Remember, if information is well known, any predictive value it contains is already built into current prices. Thus, its unlikely you can use it to generate outperformance. Investors fail to differentiate between information and value-relevant information, trading on what is nothing more than information that has no value. Certainly, if you hear it on TV or read it in the newspaper, it is far too late to act on it. Summary There will always be something for investors to worry about, which is why Warren Buffett warned that once you have ordinary intelligence, success in investing is determined far more by temperamentthe ability to ignore the noise of the markets and adhere to your well-thought-out plan that incorporates the risks of negative events. Hopefully, your plan reflects the certainty that negative events, including nonforecastable Black Swan events, will occur with a high degree of regularity and ensures you are not taking more risk than you have the ability, willingness and need to take. Getting that right increases your ability to ignore the noise of the market and raises the odds that your head, not your stomach, will be making investment decisions. Ive yet to meet a stomach that makes good decisions. Lastly, ask yourself this question: Is Warren Buffett spending even one minute worrying about a yield curve inversion? The answer almost certainly is no, because he has said he hasnt even looked at, or listened to, an economic or market forecast in more than 25 years. One of the great anomalies in finance, which I point out in my book Think, Act, and Invest Like Warren Buffett, is that while investors idolize Buffett, they not only fail to follow his advice but often do the exact opposite, to their great detriment. Summarizing, the strategy most likely to allow you to achieve your financial goals is to develop and adhere to a long-term plan in line with your ability, willingness and need to take risk. By doing so, you will be better able to look past the noise of the market and focus on investing in a systematic way that will help you meet long-term goals.

       "  'content': 'SEOUL -- Activist investor Korea Corporate Governance Improvement announced on Monday it has raised its stake in Hanjin-KAL to 13.47%, setting the stage for an ownership battle over the country\\'s largest transportation conglomerate following the death of its Chairman Cho Yang-ho on Sunday. KCGI said it bought a further 0.79% stake in Hanjin-KAL on the stock market over the last three weeks. The fund has been pressuring Hanjin-KAL, the holding company of Korean Air Lines, to improve its corporate governance since buying a 9% stake in the company in November. In late March, Hanjin-KAL fought off an attempt by the fund to unseat a director close to the late chairman. KCGI declined to comment on its recent stock purchase. Shares of Hanjin-KAL jumped 20.63% to 30,400 won on Monday following news of the chairman\\'s death on expectations of improved corporate governance at the company. The benchmark Kospi was up 0.04% to 2,210.60. Analysts say a battle for ownership of the conglomerate is now likely. Including the late chairman\\'s stake, the Cho family owns 28.95% of Hanjin-KAL, followed by KCGI with 13.47%. The National Pension Service is the third-largest shareholder with a 6.64% stake. \"I don\\'t think that Cho family has a big enough stake because it needs at least a 33% stake to defend its managerial rights under commercial law,\" said Park Ju-keun, president of CEO Score, a corporate analysis company. \"KCGI will demand many things [of Hanjin-KAL] to maximize its investment value.\" Park said the Cho family is expected to inherit the entire 17.84% stake owned by Chairman Cho in order to retain their influence, but he did not rule out the possibility of a family feud, which could threaten the family\\'s continued ownership. \"If the three siblings fight over managerial rights of the company, it would provide KCGI a chance to flex its muscles,\" he said. Cho has three children. His son, Won-tae, is president of Korean Air, while daughter Hyun-ah, a former vice president of the airline, was forced out of management following her involvement in the \"nut rage\" scandal of 2014. The other daughter, Hyun-min, resigned from her position as vice president of the airline last year after she allegedly physically abused an employee of an advertisement agency. Kang Seong-jin, an analyst at KB Securities, agreed with Park on the importance of the inheritance process. Cho\\'s wife and children will have to pay inheritance taxes estimated at 162.5 billion won, which may lead them to sell some of the shares, he said. \"How to inherit Cho\\'s stake in Hanjin-KAL will be the key factor in the group\\'s corporate governance and the stock prices of its main affiliates,\" Kang said. \"If the inheritance process does not go smoothly, it is expected that KCGI will strengthen its influence fast.\"'}]"
