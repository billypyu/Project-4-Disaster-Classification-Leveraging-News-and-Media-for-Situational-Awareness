Ellen Airhart,"The red imported fire ant is one of the worlds most invasive species. Its sting delivers a burning poison that kills living tissue. Together groups of ants devour deer fawns, baby birds, reptiles, and almost any other source of protein they can get their mandibles on. They form acres of crisscrossing tunnels with thousands of cooperative workers. And their territory has steadily been spreading.
The fire ants story is in some ways the opposite of what the insect world as a whole is experiencing. Measuring bug populations is an imperfect sciencetheyre small, mobile, and hidden. But they are undoubtedly shrinking, due to habitat destruction, climate change, and other human-driven trends. A German study found a 75 percent decline in insect biomass between 1989 and 2017. Another German study found that the butterfly population decreased from 117 species in 1840 to 71 species in 2013. And a 2014 Science review found that of the invertebrate species that are actively being monitored, the majority have decreased by almost half.
But for the fire ant, this mass die-off is a blessing. They are experts at filling in the ecological gaps where other organisms have disappeared. That can mean colonizing areas where other insects have slowly died away, or blossoming in the aftermath of a big disaster, like a flood, or expanding their turf after a smaller upset, like a lot of typical human landscaping. Humans are a fire ants best friend, says Walter Tschinkel, a biology professor at Florida State University and author of The Fire Ants. In the south, if you have a lawn, you have created a lovely habitat for fire ants.
Fans of warm temperatures, the ants build their homes around sprinklers and irrigation channels that allow them to set up outposts in dry climates. With human-driven climate change not only heating up the world but exacerbating hurricanes and wildfires, fire ants are primed to reap their rewards. They are steadily expanding their territory northward and, in the US, westward.
Fire ants are a symptom of a global problem, says Craig Allen, leader of the US Geological Survey in Nebraska. He refers to it as biotic homogenization. Its a term for what happens when an invasive species outperforms locals and takes over their resources. In the long run, the outcome is less genetic diversity, and fewer evolutionary strategies for species to succeed. Which leads, over time, to weaker ecosystems and more extinctions.
The red imported fire ant evolved on the floodplains of central South America, but people have hauled the ants all over the world on wooden shipping pallets. Once they arrived in the USin Alabama, sometime in the 1930s or early 40sthey developed another superpower. Prior to their spread in the US, they were known to organize in colonies with a single queen. If another mound arose in their vicinity, they attacked these rival ants. As a result, colonies were spaced relatively far apart, with about 40 mounds per acre. But sometime around 1973, something shifted.
A group of USDA scientists came across an area near Gulfport, Mississippi with an unusual number of fire ant mounds in close vicinity, with many more fertile queens than the usual single mama ant. Over time, scientists began to realized the significance of these findings, that the red imported fire ant was fundamentally different from other ants. Though some ant species have multiple queens per colony and others have just one, no other species uses both reproductive strategies. Fire ant colonies with multiple queens are denser400 to 500 mounds an acre, instead of 40and take more of a toll on the species around them. Theyre also much harder to kill with an insecticide, since the poison has to lop off the heads of several queens instead of just one.
Fire ants are perhaps most notorious for forming floating balls of horror that can coast through hurricanes. After Hurricane Harvey, the ants formed rafts of workers that link together using hooks on their limbs. If flood victims accidentally run into these mobile colonies, the ants attack, turning a dangerous situation into a potentially deadly one. One person wrote on Twitter that he Had a golf ball size group wash up on my foot during flooding near Austin.
An estimated 14 million people are stung every year, with some of those incidents leading to hospitalizations. About half of people are at least somewhat allergic to fire ant stings, and roughly one percent of people are at risk of having a dangerous full-body reaction. The cost of a world where Solenopsis invicta thrives doesnt end with the medical bills. They cause at least $6.7 billion in annual damages to not only people but houses, electrical and telephone lines, and agriculture.
That figure only captures the costs we can easily estimate. The ants are also adept at taking down baby birds and reptiles, including quail, alligators, lizards, and turtlesin particular, the threatened gopher tortoise, which digs burrows that more than 360 other species use for shelter. Once one of these baby animals pokes a hole in its shell to begin hatching, the ants can swarm inside their shells.
As this ant continues its plunder, the outlook for these other species (and our own ability to walk fearlessly across a lawn) is bleak. But some species seem to be defying the odds and evolving fire-ant resistance. The fence lizard, common in the Eastern US, is known to freeze in response to a threat. Thats terrible if your enemy is the fire ant, which can swarm, bite, and ultimately kill such a target. In areas where fire ants thrive, however, fence lizards appeared to have learned to bolt instead, according to a recent study in the journal Global Change Biology.
Yet fire ants continue to conquer new territory, confounding scientists estimates of their likely spread time and again. If you look back over time, it's a lesson in humility, says Allen. With warming temperatures, nothings stopping the red imported fire ant any time soon.

Matt Simon,"For the Inuit of Labrador in Canada, climate disaster has already arrived. These indigenous people form an intense bond with their land, hunting for food and fur. “People like to go out on the land to feel good,” says Noah Nochasak in the documentary Lament for the Land. “If they can’t go out on the land, travel a long ways to feel good, they don’t feel like people.” The Inuit’s lands, though, are warming twice as fast as the global average, imperiling the ice they rely on to travel. In the fall, hunters tend to get stuck in the community, because ice hasn’t fully formed up—and again, in the spring, when things are melting. Climate change is making these ice transition periods even longer. “During those times historically, there has been some increases in suicide or suicide attempts or ideation in the communities,” says Ashlee Cunsolo, a health geographer who has studied the region. “There is a lot of concern among the mental health practitioners. What does that mean if this time is lengthened from two weeks to eight weeks?” It’s known as ecological grief—the mourning of ecosystems and species and ways of life that are disappearing as the planet warms. But it isn’t just hitting the Inuit. As our planet plays host to rising seas, more intense storms, and higher temperatures, those conditions will support a growing international mental health crisis. “Things like depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, domestic abuse, all these things tend to go up in the aftermath of a natural disasters,” says psychologist Susan Clayton of the College of Wooster, co-author of an extensive report on climate change and mental health. “As we have more natural disasters, one would expect to also have increases in those kinds of mental health consequences.” Take Hurricane Katrina. In its aftermath, a sample of survivors found one in six met the criteria for PTSD. Rates of suicide and suicidal thoughts doubled. And especially in refugee situations, those mental health challenges can be intimately tied to physical health, compounding the harm. “When people are moving to places they bring diseases with them that the home population might not be immune to, and on the flip side these people are moving into places where they might not have immunity to the diseases in the new place,” says Jonathan Patz, director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin. Even those whose homes aren’t directly threatened by sea level rise or fiercer hurricanes aren’t immune. By the end of the century, the average American will have to endure four to eight times the number of 95+ degree days. Arizonans will get it particularly bad: Their number of 95+ degree days a year will leap from an average of 116 to over 200. And several studies have made a link between higher temperatures and higher rates of suicide. One particularly data-intensive survey recently published in Nature Climate Change compiled temperatures and suicide statistics on the county level for the US, and municipality level for Mexico. They compared these granular regions not with each other, but with themselves—so the average monthly temperature in Palo Alto in July 2009 versus July 2010. This controlled for differences between locations in factors like poverty rates or gun ownership rates, both of which have been tied to suicide rates. The uptick in suicide rates the researchers found may be small—a rise of 2 percent in Mexico and.7 percent in the US for every additional degree Celsius in average monthly temperature—and the relationship is far from simple. Rates of suicide fluctuate around the world, and where those suicide rates are highest, the temperature isn’t necessarily the highest. But extrapolated forward, the impact on public health could be devastating. “The fact that our results are so consistent across different socioeconomic strata, across different populations, suggests a common biological response,” says Stanford economist Marshall Burke, lead author of the study. It's unclear if scientists will unearth shared mechanisms behind the mental health effects of climate-related trauma. But the experience itself is obviously, intuitively human. When Cunsolo and a colleague published an essay in Nature Climate Change earlier this year on ecological grief, the email response they got was huge, and it was cosmopolitan. “It wasn't drought-affected farmers, it wasn't low-lying island states, it wasn't people who had been forced to relocate, it was people often living in urban settings would describe this overall sense of despair and anxiety,” says Cunsolo. The root of our shared problem may be the same, but the manifestations of climate change can be wildly different. “Each region, each place, each culture, is going to experience something very, very different,” says Cunsolo. For the Inuit, it’s about ice. For the Southern US, it’s supercharged hurricanes. As with all health care, prevention is the best medicine. But in the case of climate change, we may be too late.

Adam Rogers,"This past year, 2017, was the worst fire season in American history. Over 9.5 million acres burned across North America. Firefighting efforts cost $2 billion. This past year, 2017, was the seventh-worst Atlantic hurricane season on record and the worst since 2005. There were six major storms. Early estimates put the costs at more than $180 billion. As the preventable disease hepatitis A spread through homeless populations in California cities in 2017, 1 million Yemenis contracted cholera amid a famine. Diphtheria killed 21 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, on the run from a genocide. Disaster, Pestilence, War, and Famine are riding as horsemen of a particular apocalypse. In 2016, the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere reached 403 parts per million, higher than it has been since at least the last ice age. By the end of 2017, the United States was on track to have the most billion-dollar weather- and climate-related disasters since the government started counting in 1980. We did that. Transnational corporations and the most powerful militaries on Earth are already building to prepare for higher sea levels and more extreme weather. The FIRE complex—finance, insurance, and real estate—knows exactly what 2017 cost them ( natural and human-made disasters : $306 billion and 11,000 lives), and can calculate more of the same in 2018. They know that the radical alteration of Earth’s climate isn’t just something that’s going to happen in 100 years if we’re not careful, or in 50 years if we don’t change our economy and moonshot the crap out of science and technology. It’s here. Now. It happened. Look behind you. Let me rephrase: Absent any changes, by 2050 Earth will be a couple degrees hotter overall. Sea levels will be a foot higher. Now, 2050 seems as impossibly far away to me as 2017 did when I was 12 years old. I live in the future! And I like a lot of it. I like the magic glass slab in my pocket and the gene therapy and the robots. I mention this because in 2050, my oldest child will be the same age I am today, and I have given him a broken world. I don’t want that. So 2017 taught a lesson, at last, that scientists and futurists have been screaming about. Humanity has to reduce the amount of carbon it’s pumping into the air. Radically. Or every year will be worse from here on out. But 2017 also made plain the shape of the overall disaster. All those fires and floods and outbreaks are symptoms of the same problem, and it’s time to start dealing with that in a clear-eyed way. It’s also time to start building differently—to start making policies that understand that the American coastline is going to be redrawn by the sea, and that people can’t keep building single-family homes anywhere they can grade a flat pad. The wildland-urban interface can’t keep spreading at will. People can’t keep pumping fresh water out of aquifers without restoring them. Infrastructure for water and power has to be hardened against more frequent, more intense storms, backed up and reinforced so hundreds of thousands of people don’t go without electricity as they are in post-hurricane Puerto Rico. In short: Change, but also adapt. Fire season in the West is now a permanent condition; don’t build buildings that burn so easily in places that burn every year. Hurricanes and storm surges are going to continue to walk up the Caribbean and onto the Gulf Coast, or maybe along the seaboard. Don’t put houses on top of the wetlands that absorb those storms. Don’t insure the people who do. Build ways for people to get around without cars. Create a power grid that pulls everything it can from renewable sources like wind and solar. Keep funding public health research, surveillance, and ways to deal with mosquito-borne diseases that thrive in a hotter world. And the next time someone in a city planning meeting says that new housing shouldn’t get built in a residential area because it’s not in keeping with the sense of the community and might disrupt parking, tell them what that means: that they want young people to have lesser lives, that they don’t want poor people and people of color to have the same opportunities they did, and that they’d rather the planet’s environment get crushed by letting bad buildings spread to inhospitable places than increasing density in cities. This apocalypse doesn't hurt everyone. Some people benefit. It’s not a coincidence that the FIRE industries also donate the most money to federal political campaigns. Rich people living behind walls they think can’t be breached by any rising tide, literal or metaphoric, made this disaster. And then they gaslighted the vulnerable into distrusting anyone raising the alarm. The people who benefit have made it seem as if this dark timeline was all perfectly fine. It isn’t. And that’s why it’ll change. In 1957 Charles Fritz and Harry Williams, the research associate and technical director, respectively, of the National Academy of Sciences’ Disaster Studies Committee, wrote a paper that sparked the field of disaster sociology. Their findings were counterintuitive then, and somehow remain so. People in disasters, they said, don’t loot and riot. They help each other. “The net result of most disasters is a dramatic increase in social solidarity among the affected populace during the emergency and immediate post-emergency periods,” they wrote. “The sharing of a common threat to survival and the common suffering produced by the disaster tend to produce a breakdown of pre-existing social distinctions and a great outpouring of love, generosity, and altruism.” In a disaster, we help each other. The trick is recognizing the disaster. Through that lens, fixing the problem and protecting one another against its consequences isn’t merely inarguable. It’s human nature. We’re all in this together.","The past year was one of the worst on record for natural disasters.

Jason Kehe,"Look at all the pretty drones. Hovering above sports stadiums from Houston to Pyeongchang, many hundreds of them have lately sparkled in artful murmuration. On a recent Time magazine cover, 958 drones pixelated the sky. The world record, 1,374 LED-bedazzled microbots, was set by Chinese company EHang UAV in May. So-called drone swarms—the phrase people have taken up with gusto—are having their biggest, buzziest year ever. It’s an evocative word, swarms, and innocuous enough when applied to one of Intel’s drone light shows. But it’s tinged with alarm—if drones can dance at twilight, they can also attack. Sure enough, a gang outside Denver sent a small fleet to harass FBI agents on a raid earlier this year. In Syria, rebels reportedly sicced a squadron of quadrotors on a Russian base. To the media, both events were swarms. Take comfort, then, in this buzzkill: “The swarm is really an illusion,” says Mac Schwager, an assistant professor at Stanford who studies multi­robot systems. Schwager, along with many of his colleagues, resists the word. Too entomological, conjuring as it does frillions of bugs surging as a single superorganism through the air. ( Flocking birds, in fact, were the field’s original inspiration—though the occasional roboticist does try studying insects.) When drones “swarm,” on the other hand, they’ve been choreographed in advance, or else are being controlled by human minders with joysticks. Even the DOD’s recent military demos have required teleoperators. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Drones Not that researchers at MIT, ETH Zurich, and elsewhere aren’t trying to imbue drones with hive-mindedness. In Schwager’s lab, small groups of five or 10 really can sync their movements, powered by so-called decentralized algorithms that tell each bot where its buddies are in space and time. But fully autonomous systems, Schwager says, are “sort of in the R&amp;D phase.” More removed still are drones that can actively learn from one another and derive unprogrammed behaviors from their esoteric robo-chatter. The 2017 web film Slaughterbots perpetuates such unrealities. In it, an intelligent drone fleet tears through a college campus, murdering students. Never mind that quadrotors aren’t capable of navigating indoors, where GPS signals can’t propagate. The point of the short, which was screened late last year at a UN weapons convention in Geneva and has been viewed on YouTube more than 2.5 million times, is to scarify the notion of robots working together. Linked up, they’ll inevitably become a locust plague on humankind. Except that’s how teams of drones will one day be able to survey natural disasters, rescue survivors, clean up oceans, farm fields, explore other planets, and deliver your burritos. Networking isn’t inherently evil. Nora Ayanian, a roboticist at USC, imagines a scenario in which every bot is programmed slightly differently, so that when they’re deployed en masse, the smartest among them teaches the pack how to act. Ayanian calls it “leveraging diversity in the control policy,” an engineer’s way of saying that more perspectives means better results. Diversity matters, even in machines.

Rachel Becker,"The worst disaster in California’s history wasn’t an earthquake, or a fire, or a drought — it was a flood that killed thousands, wiped out mines and ranches, and submerged the state capital, Sacramento. For 43 days, starting in December 1861, California was inundated. Today, hardly anyone thinks about the floodwaters that turned California’s Central Valley into a vast lake — but it will happen again. “It’s not a question of if, but when,” writes seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones in her new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters H ave Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them). That’s why it’s key for us to know about the disasters in our history, so that we’re not doomed to repeat them on what will certainly be a much larger scale. After all, more than 100 times as many people now live in California as did during that deluge, Jones writes. “What’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities.” While natural hazards are inevitable, the destruction they wreak is not, Jones says in an interview with The Verge. “We can make choices about how we handle that — but we have to think ahead,” she says. Working at the US Geological Survey, Jones led a team of scientists who investigated the potential catastrophes in California’s future. One of them was a flood, and the team discovered that our existing flood control strategies would be no match for a deluge nearly the size of the one that started in 1861: The disaster would cause more devastation than an earthquake on the infamous San Andreas fault. After 33 years at the USGS, Jones retired and opened the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, which aims to boost community resilience using science. In her book, she lays out catastrophic disasters in human history from the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii to Hurricane Katrina to the Tohoku quake in Japan in 2011. She tells both the scientific story of how disasters unfolded, and the human story of the communities they struck. “We have to think ahead.” Her goal is to teach readers about disasters by drawing them in with narratives, and to address the ways human nature can make it harder to prepare for the future. Most of us assume a big disaster is going to be similar to smaller ones we’ve experienced, which can make us overconfident in our ability to deal with catastrophes — something experts call “normalization bias.” Our tendency to focus on more immediate threats can also come at the expense of preparing for more distant ones — which makes sense, Jones says: “If you worry about the 100-year flood and not about the wolf that’s about to eat your children, your DNA does not get passed down.” She draws on her experience as a scientist, and as a communicator who helped the public make sense of the destruction in the aftermath of earthquakes. The Verge spoke with Jones about natural hazards, risk assessment, and the disaster that haunts her. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. I grew up in California, and only learned about the 1861-1862 flood last year. How do you keep the memory of such a major disaster fresh, and make sure that people don’t forget that this could happen again? Photo by Helen Berger Dr. Lucy Jones It’s very difficult to do. In a natural world, if we hadn’t built all of our flood control systems, we would have smaller floods much more often. When you have the smaller ones, at least you know that flooding is a risk. But you do tend to believe that the risk is what you’ve already dealt with. So, paradoxically, the flood managers who were fully aware of the 1861 flood seemed more willing to say, ‘We’ve got it covered. That isn’t really going to happen again.” And, like with earthquakes, I find that the people were actually part of a response to Northridge, [ a quake that hit part of the Los Angeles area in 1994 ], are much more overconfident about their abilities to handle the really big one, because they feel like they dealt with the really big one. And that that wasn’t the really big one doesn’t get through. Hundreds of years ago, we didn’t have the information to be able to think ahead. Now we have more information, and yet we still struggle with the emotional aspect of it, because it doesn’t seem real to us. And that, right there, is the challenge of natural disasters. We know what they’re going to do, we know how to build to avoid the damage, but everything about human nature keeps us from looking forward [for] that really long-term planning. So it requires much more rational, logical thought, and reasoned discourse. So how do we now wrestle with the human inability to think ahead and also to remember the past? “Around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before.” Because of globalization and improved telecommunications, we now have a situation where a flood or a big disaster somewhere else in the world is something we can experience in real time. One of the most striking examples of that was the Tohoku earthquake in northern Japan [in 2011]. I’m sitting in my living room in California, and I can turn on the TV and watch in real time the tsunami wave. And we see the people fleeing from it, from the air. We don’t have enough to save them at this point, but we watch them in real time suffer through this. Now, around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before, I would say. Fifteen years ago, it was rare to find a person who knew what a tsunami was. But between the Indian Ocean event [in 2004], and Japan [in 2011], and the really direct, emotional experience with the power of telecommunications, we have a really different understanding and experience of it. And that is allowing us to overcome that normalization bias, and it’s part of the reason that we’ve been able to [make progress] here in Southern California [with] getting people to take the risk seriously and doing something about it. For us, it isn’t about tsunamis, it’s mostly about earthquakes. The book is divided by chapter into case studies of different disasters through history — which one kept you up at night? Which one haunted you? The 1927 Mississippi flood — the greatest flood disaster in American history. Mississippi is a huge river system that drains the majority of American states. A huge rainfall starting in the fall of 1926 through winter and spring led to failures of the levees protecting the land around the Mississippi river. And 27,000 square miles were flooded and over 1 million people were flooded out of their homes. Over 600,000 people were living in refugee camps. “What really haunted me... was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens.” But what really haunted me about it — and made it by far the most difficult chapter to research and write — was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens. What happened to African American victims of the flood was appalling, and just the inhumanity of how they were treated. The Kanto earthquake, which was only four years before that was also — in Japan — an equally horrible turning on neighbors. And it was recognizing that part of the human experience is the need to find a reason why it was the victim’s fault, to blame the victim: “Because if it was the victim’s fault, then I can protect myself by not making those same mistakes.” It’s a subconscious response to fear: “I don’t want that to be able to happen to me.” So you find reasons that it’s the victim’s fault. And at the worst level, you then punish the victim of the situation. So when you ask what haunted me, I’m an Earth scientist. So the physical part of it was all what I understood and expected going in. What haunted me, and inspired, was sometimes the horribleness of human response, and sometimes the real inspiration of human response. And you see both in those stories. The book talks about the disconnect between the language scientists use and the language the public use s to talk about disasters. Scientists have their wind speeds for hurricanes, magnitude for earthquake, probability for flood — then the public asks, “Was it The Big One?” How do we bridge that gap — and do we need to? “I just see people talking past each other so much.” The stuff I put in this book — none of it is really hard to understand. A high schooler could easily read the book and understand it, maybe even somebody younger. And yet we don’t teach it. And therefore, the public doesn’t have a context within which to be getting the information or having the discussion. So we need better education in science, which does not mean learning a bunch of facts — the other part is to understand how to think about science, the fundamentals of science as a process for learning what’s really true. We don’t teach that. But then we also need to help the scientists understand that people are looking for a mix: they want the science, but they also want the human side of it. And we need to help the scientists do a better job of being to answer the human questions. I just see people talking past each other so much. You write about how being a seismologist gives you an unusual perspective on time and that a forecast that a disaster will happen “‘sometime in the next millennium’ sounds not like an evasion, but like a threat.” How has this perspective shaped your own relationship with risk? Are you resigned to it, or have you bought every kind of disaster insurance there is? “The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but chances of it in my lifetime?” The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but the chances of it in my lifetime? Well, the San Andreas is probably going to have [an earthquake] in my lifetime, but the fault I live near probably isn’t. So yes, it’s a possibility, but I just have to keep it balanced because it’s a relatively low possibility compared to other things. People assume that where I live must be a place that’s really safe from earthquakes, but we moved to a community with really good schools sitting right on top of a significant fault. We were basically gambling that an earthquake wouldn’t happen before the kids got out of high school, and it worked. Climate change is going to make meteorological disasters more frequent and more devastating, right? What do we need to do to make sure that we’re prepared? It’s going to be very difficult. People do not sufficiently understand what we are doing to ourselves with this. We need to do everything we can to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere and reduce what’s already there if it’s at all possible. Because more heat in the atmosphere doesn’t just mean it’s warmer and ‘oh I guess I can handle that.’ That means more energy to drive storms, and they are going to be getting worse. “That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger.” So first off, we’ve got to admit it. We can’t talk about nuisance flooding, because high tide is bringing it into your house, without thinking about what that means when the hurricane comes through. One of the big issues in America is that we have a pretty strong tradition of individual land rights: nobody gets to tell you what to do with your own land. We are really struggling as a society to be able to make those big scale decisions. We need to be changing our attitudes about community, how much we share, to accept that we’re dependent on the decisions of others. We don’t like to do that as Americans either, we so prize our independence. So we philosophically oppose that, but that doesn’t change what’s going to happen.

That hazards are inevitable and the disaster is not. We as a society have choices, both what we do individually, but also a choice to work together.

KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"The remains of a house in Perryville, Mo., after a tornado. Credit Jon Durr/Getty Images Extreme weather events caused a total of $306 billion in damage in the United States last year, making 2017 the most expensive year on record for natural disasters in the country, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. A trio of major hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, contributed hundreds of billions to the total. But the year was seemingly mired in disaster, from a freeze in the Southeast that damaged fruit crops in March, to hail storms that whipped across Colorado, Oklahoma and other central states in May, to the tornadoes that struck the Midwest in June. Unusual consequences of extreme weather could be found all over the map. Thirteen cows died in a field in Pennington County, S.D., after ingesting anthrax spores from the soil; they had changed their grazing patterns during a drought that lasted much of the year in South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana. The cows’ demise was a small part of the $2.5 billion of damage that struck the three states. In all, there were 16 natural disasters that caused more than $1 billion of damage in 2017. In 1980, when NOAA first started tallying records, there were three, adjusted for inflation. Scientists cannot always say with certainty that a given natural disaster was influenced by climate change. But some may be related to warming, and the contiguous United States experienced its third-warmest year on record in 2017. The temperature average was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, said Jake Crouch, a climate scientist from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center. Here are the 16 billion-dollar disasters from 2017: Some made headlines for weeks, and some were simply overtaken in the public’s consciousness by the next one.

Aimée Lutkin,"Traveling is a wild adventure, and part of what makes it an adventure is the possibility of complete disaster. Here are some tips for how to prepare for the worst so you can relax and enjoy the best of what your trip has to offer, while minimizing your risk for the worst. When you leave the U.S. as an American citizen traveling abroad, you have a few safety nets, and Reddit user u/baccgirl pointed ou t on LifeProTips that you should know what they are before the flight takes off. A huge one is your country’s embassy; before you arrive, make sure you know where that embassy is located in your destination, and what their hours of operation are. Commenter u/ doublestitch added that you might be better off getting that information for your country’s consulate, as embassies general attend to diplomatic matters. But hey, why not both? And that’s just the beginning: Save your information An embassy can help you get an emergency passport if yours is lost or stolen, but the process is sped up considerably if you have certain details on hand. U/Baccgirl writes: Have a secure email that you can access while overseas, with scans of important papers. Birth certificate, passport scan, emergency contacts. Once your international travel has finalised, delete the email address. This is pretty good advice for any details you might need access to while abroad that you don’t want just floating around forever in your gmail account. If you're like us, the keys to your life are kept within Gmail's walls. Make sure… Read more Read But you don’t just have to be digital. After all, if you’ve lost everything, that might include email access. U/ madi154 wrote of their own harrowing experience saved by a paper and pen: Also write down important phone numbers of your family members and the number of the hotel or people you’re staying with and the address. Have multiple papers with this and put this everywhere! Put it in every luggage, wallet and bag you will travel with. You never know when you will need it. For example, my luggage was lost and thankfully I had a paper with the phone number and address of the people I was staying with so that the luggage could get delivered there. Check your passport expiration date You need a valid passport to leave the US, but u/baccgirl writes that many countries “require you to have a minimum of 6 months of validity remaining on your passport AFTER your departure date from that country.” Even if your vacation is only a few weeks long, you need that passport to be valid for much, much longer. Just check the numbers in advance so you don’t get sent home from the airport extremely disappointed. Register your trip in case of emergency There was also a recommendation from u/swild89, who commented, “I’ll add to that—register your travel itinerary with the government. You can plan everything you want, but if an emergency strikes, you are prepared.” In the US, this is called the STEP program, and it make the embassy in the country you’re visiting aware you’re there in case of emergency. If there is danger in the area you’ll be notified, and in the event of a natural disaster, you’ll be accounted for. Be ready to roll with the punches Some commenters complained that all these tips were actually just advising people to go overboard and ruin their vacation with worry. As u/ RunninADorito wrote: Being fully and completely prepared is both impossible and stupid. The idea that traveling to a different country requires a crazy amount of preparation is the wrong mindset. If you’re going to France you might want to do X. If you’re going to Cambodia do Y. Understand the circumstances and deal with likely issues. Don’t be scared of life and the world. An ounce of preparation is worth a pound of trouble, but it’s also important to keep things in perspective, and not let fear stop you from seeing the world.","Traveling is a wild adventure, and part of what makes it an adventure is the possibility of complete disaster.

CAITLIN DICKERSON,"Mr. McKinney’s employees were using social media to spread information about the storm that had been translated into Spanish, but worried that it was not reaching everyone who might need it. Ms. Garduño Garcia, the organizer, said that people living in trailer parks in North Carolina had received evacuation notices in English demanding that they leave their homes by midweek. But she said that many people stayed put, confused by conflicting information and the language barrier. From her trailer home in Elgin, S.C., in the north-central part of the state, an immigrant woman named Maria said on Friday, before the worst of the storm, that she, her husband and their 15-year-old daughter were stocking up on canned food and water, but were still unclear about whether they were safe or needed to flee. “We still haven’t received information about how much rain to expect,” she said. She was concerned that the trailer could be overcome by floodwaters or crushed by a fallen tree. “We don’t know how much it can handle. We’re trying to see where we can go, or if we should stay to see if things get more intense.” Maria, who asked that her last name not be published because of her immigration status, said that her daughter’s high school had opened up a shelter and was giving out free meals, but that she did not feel comfortable going there. For one thing, she said, it would have meant leaving behind their two cats. The family would go to a friend’s house if they had to, she said, though she was not certain that they would be any safer there. Over the weekend, many immigrants turned to informal networks of support to avoid interacting with the authorities. Leticia Zavala, a farm labor organizer in Dudley, N.C., said that 40 farm workers slept at her organization’s headquarters instead of going to shelters. North Carolina is a major producer of sweet potatoes and tobacco. Some of the farm workers are undocumented; others have guest worker visas. But Ms. Zavala said that many were mindful of a handful of cases in the last year in which growers turned over migrant workers to the authorities for using false Social Security numbers. Ms. Zavala said that most of these farm workers live in migrant housing, which is provided by growers and can vary from mobile homes that house six to eight people to barracks that accommodate hundreds.","Rising waters blocked a road in Fayetteville, N.C., on Tuesday.

Alessandra Potenza,"As the world’s temperatures go up, the Arctic keeps losing its ice. This winter, the area covered by sea ice was the second smallest on record — after last year. And many experts believe that this summer, the Arctic ice cap will shrink to record lows. Why should I care, you ask? “The Arctic is a natural freezer,” says Michael Mann, a climatologist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, in an email to The Verge. “Just like you’d be concerned if all of the ice in your freezer melted, so should you be concerned about the loss of Arctic sea ice.” “The Arctic is a natural freezer.” The changes that are happening in the Arctic don’t just affect the Arctic. Our planet is an interconnected system, and the vanishing ice is already having ripple effects down south. Among them: faster global warming, rising sea levels, and possibly more extreme natural disasters. ( Plus, the polar bears will suffer.) Scientists are still trying to figure many things out, but pretty much everyone agrees that a melting Arctic isn’t a good thing. “This whole climate change is a big can of worms,” says Ignatius Rigor, coordinator of the International Arctic Buoy Program at the University of Washington. “It’s pretty scary because we’re starting to realize more and more how big of an impact we’re having on the planet.” So here are some ways that the vanishing Arctic ice is affecting the rest of the world — you included. The albedo effect The albedo effect is just a fancy expression for a very simple concept: white surfaces like ice and snow reflect about 80 percent of the Sun’s energy back into space. That allows us to keep cool. But if those white spots disappear, the darker ocean and land will absorb 90 percent of that heat, accelerating global warming. “If you have a black car, it gets hotter in the summer than if you have a white car,” says Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge. The albedo effect due to vanishing sea ice is already responsible for about 25 percent of global warming, according to Jennifer Francis, a research professor at Rutgers University’s School of Environment and Biological Sciences. So we’re all getting hotter because sea ice is shrinking, and the Arctic is warming up twice as fast as the rest of the world. That, in and of itself, can lead to even more problems. Sea level rise Sea ice floats, so when it melts, it does not raise sea levels. But warmer temperatures in the Arctic are causing another type of ice to disappear as well: land-based ice in Greenland. If that ice melts, it causes sea levels to go up. Scientists estimate that if the entire Greenland ice sheet — which is roughly three times the size of Texas — melted, sea levels would soar 20 feet. “Certain cities will have to be abandoned.” The seas are already rising, and so far, Greenland has contributed to only 4 to 5 percent of that rise, says Francis. But melt rates are accelerating, and that poses a serious threat to anyone living on the coast. In the US, that’s about 40 percent of the population. Residents in Florida, New Jersey, and Maryland are already experiencing more flooding. And the situation isn’t going to get better. “Certain cities will have to be abandoned,” Wadhams says. Rigor agrees: “Our coastal towns aren’t really built for this.” In Alaska, there’s also another problem tied to vanishing sea ice. The ice protects coastal towns from big waves, Rigor says. Just this winter, as ice in the Bering Sea shrunk to record levels, huge waves pummeled the town of Diomede, engulfing homes. Erosion is also forcing the 400-plus residents of Newtok, Alaska, to relocate. More extreme weather There’s another way that a warming Arctic might hit close to home: many scientists believe that it might affect extreme weather events in North America and Europe. Earlier this year, for instance, research showed that when the Arctic is unusually warm, extreme winter weather is two to four times more likely in the eastern US. That may be happening because a warming Arctic disrupts the jet stream, “a river of fast-moving wind high over our heads” that “basically controls and creates all the weather that we experience,” Francis says. The difference in temperature between the Arctic and the mid latitudes, where we live and it’s warmer, is one of the driving forces of the jet stream. But as the vanishing ice is causing the Arctic to warm twice as fast as the rest of the world, that temperature difference is diminishing. And that’s weakening the winds in the jet stream, Francis says. A weaker jet stream also has more waves, and that means more extreme weather that lingers for longer. “a river of fast-moving wind high over our heads” Francis says we’ve already seen this jet stream disruption in action this winter, as the eastern US experienced record-breaking freezing temperatures, a “bomb cyclone,” and three nor’easters in just 11 days. But others say there’s still “a lot of debate in the scientific community” on whether or not a warming Arctic is to blame, according to Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London. More research is looking into this. And it’s not just about the US or Europe. A study in 2017 showed that there’s a link between shrinking Arctic ice and a build-up of smog in China. Thawing permafrost Rising temperatures in the Arctic are also causing frozen ground, called permafrost, to thaw in Alaska, Canada, and Siberia. That’s concerning because permafrost traps huge amounts of carbon — at least as much carbon as it’s in the atmosphere right now, Francis says. If the permafrost warms up, it can start releasing this carbon in the form of two powerful heat-trapping greenhouse gases, methane and carbon dioxide, making global warming worse. One study published in Nature Geoscience in 2012 estimated that thawed permafrost could contribute up to 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 degrees Celsius) of warming by 2300. That may not seem like much, but most scientists believe that we need to keep warming well below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) if we want to stave off the worst effects of climate change. And the greenhouse gas leak from the permafrost is independent from all the carbon dioxide we keep pumping into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuel. Those CO2 concentrations aren’t going down. Wadhams says that offshore permafrost also poses a danger: the frozen, underwater sediments in the Arctic are rich in methane, and if those layers start melting, we could see “a very sudden, big burst of warming that would be disastrous,” he says. But Francis says that offshore permafrost is much less of a concern right now since the ocean waters deep down are still very cold. “We got other things that are much bigger to worry about right now,” she says. the ice is also becoming thinner What’s next? Since the 1980s, the area covered by Arctic sea ice in the summer has shrunk by about 40 percent, according to NASA. The ice is also becoming thinner. It’s really hard to predict when we could see ice-free summers in the Arctic, but it could be as soon as in 20 to 40 years, Francis says. (In the winter, the North Pole has six months of darkness, so it’s likely that the ice will stay during that time of the year for a long time.) It all depends on how warm our planet gets — and to limit that, we need to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that enter the atmosphere. The likely solution, according to Wadhams, is the development of “carbon capture” technology that can remove CO2 from the air. Some projects are doing this already, but they’re not large scale enough to really make a difference. But if we devote enough research dollars to the problem, Wadhams is confident that we will find a solution. Francis agrees: once emitted, CO2 stays in the air for 100 to 200 years, so “all of the emissions that have occurred are going to affect us for a long time, unless we can figure out a way to remove them from the atmosphere.” Wadhams adds: “In the end, that’s the only thing that will save us from global warming.”","As the world’s temperatures go up, the Arctic keeps losing its ice.

EMILY S. RUEB,"Since the day 13 people were killed at Columbine High School in 1999, a carpenter from Illinois has hopped in his pickup truck to deliver 26,274 handmade wooden memorials mostly crosses, and sometimes Stars of David or crescent moons across the country, unifying grieving communities after mass shootings, natural disasters and other tragedies.
But this week the carpenter, Greg Zanis, did not have to drive far. After a former employee at an industrial warehouse fatally shot five workers and injured five police officers in suburban Chicago, he ministered to his neighbors by setting up five more crosses.
On Friday afternoon, Mr. Zanis, whom some refer to as the Cross Man, watched dozens of police cars drive past the house where he lives with his wife and three of his children in Aurora, Ill. His daughter informed him they were responding to an active shooter.

Megan Rose Dickey,"Lyft is committing $1.5 million to its Relief Rides program. The idea has historically been to better support people during times of crisis, such as natural disasters or other emergency situations. Now, Lyft is expanding its reach to help people who many need rides to job interviews or medical appointments. One of the partners Lyft is looking to continue working with is Caritas of Austin, an organization that seeks to prevent and end homelessness. Already, Lyft has partnered with New Orleans-based Youth Empowerment Project to help people get to appointments and job interviews. Lyft has been riding the do-good train as of late. Last month, Lyft announced a multi-million dollar investment in carbon offsets. The hope with that initiative is to offset the impact of the numerous Lyft cars on the road. But Lyft is not perfect. While it aims to increase access to transportation through this $1.5 million commitment, the ride-hailing company has a lackluster approach to serving the needs of people with disabilities. In March, Disability Rights Advocates filed a class-action lawsuit against Lyft, alleging the company discriminates against people who use wheelchairs by not making wheelchair-accessible cars available in the San Francisco Bay Area. At the time, a Lyft spokesperson said it currently has “partnerships and programs in place to provide enhanced WAV access in various parts of the country, and are actively exploring ways to expand them nationwide.” Hopefully, some of this money will go toward ensuring Lyft’s core product is genuinely accessible to everyone. In a blog post today, Lyft said it’s working “with strong local and national partners” and will “expand these partnerships to support a diverse array of people, depending on the needs of each local community.”","Lyft is committing $1.5 million to its Relief Rides program.

Humanitarian groups are grappling with a double crisis: the brunt of the cyclone itself, and the severe flooding left in its wake.
Nearly a week after the storm hit, heavy rains were still endangering communities isolated by flooding, and complicating efforts by rescue workers to reach them. Rising floodwaters were threatening to partially submerge Buzi, a town of 200,000, not far from Beira, the United Nations warned.
Beira has become a place of refuge for people fleeing flooded areas, but on Wednesday, the whole town still lacked electricity. Cellphone service was extremely limited, and people thronged the few areas with connectivity along the main road.
Fallen trees had yet to be cleared from central Beira, an area with modern buildings and colonial Portuguese homes. Stores and other businesses were closed. There was no activity at the port, the sector that defines the city. Large stores owned by Indians and Chinese, more recent arrivals, were shuttered.
Roofs had been torn off many buildings, but the physical damage was limited.
The greatest destruction was found in the poor rural neighborhoods outside the city center. There, many poorly built houses had collapsed instantly when the storm hit.","Nearly a week after southern Africa was hit by one the worst natural disasters in decades, it was all rescue workers could do to try to reach the victims.",2019-03-20T23:15:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Rescuers Battle Flooding in Desperate Bid to Save Cyclone Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/africa/cyclone-idai-rescue.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/world/20mozambique3/merlin_152347080_0a52cd69-308d-4aab-8299-e8666d2d11c5-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1

Jonathan Shieber,"Whether it’s by flood, fire, or the fury of a storm, climate-related catastrophes are now impacting most cities and towns across the country. As these natural disasters increase in frequency and severity, cities and the businesses that reside in them are mobilizing to understand how best to prepare for the climatological challenges they’re going to face — and increasingly they’re turning to companies like Jupiter Intelligence for information.
From offices in San Mateo, Calif., Boulder, Colo., and New York Jupiter Intelligence has made a business selling data from satellite imagery and advanced computer models to cities like New York and Miami, along with the Federal government and big insurance and real estate customers.
With its new financing, Jupiter plans to take its show on the global road, and is bringing its services to clients in Rotterdam, London, and Singapore.
It’s a story that has its roots in over two decades of work from founders Rich Sorkin, Eric Wun, Josh Hacker, and Alan Blumberg.
Wun and Sorkin met in 1996 in the early days of the development of mapping and weather prediction technologies. And got their start in the business co-founding Zeus, a weather prediction technology developer that was pitching its services to commodities traders.
“Zeus was way too early from a technology platform perspective,” says Hacker. “We put Zeus on the shelf eight years ago. Then when we came up with the idea for Jupiter most of the early ideas were already there.”
In the interim, Hacker served as the president of Kaggle, a company Google acquired back in 2017. By that point, Hacker had already left to launch Jupiter, which he started in 2016.
While Zeus predicted the thirty day weather for commodities traders, Jupiter is a more powerful toolkit that predicts the possibility of damage from severe weather and climate change for a much broader set of customers, Hacker says.
Wun and Sorkin were on board immediately, and the next person to join the fledgling team, was Hacker — who had run satellite operations for Skybox — another Google acquisition. Following the merger of Skybox with Planet Labs, Hacker took a job at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration within the Department of Commerce (one of the pre-eminent organizations focused on climate change).
The final recruit was Blumberg who was approached because of his role in developing the Princeton Ocean Model, which is used by over 5700 research and operational groups in 70 countries and his leadership position in developing 2-hour and 4-day flood predictions for Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

After its launch the company was able to land three big insurance companies, QBE, Mistui, and Nephila, which all agreed to throw cash into the company’s new $35 million round.
Jupiter’s predictive and analytics technologies have applications far beyond insurance. Airports, ports, power plants, water facilities, hospitals, municipal and even the federal government are turning to the company for information, according to Sorkin.
Jupiter raised $1 million in its seed round from DCVC (Data Collective) and then closed on $10 million more from Ignition Partners . The latest $23 million was led by Energize Ventures, a fund focused on infrastructure and climate-related investments.
SYSTEMIQ, which was co-founded by McKinsey veteran Jeremy Oppenheim, also invested in Jupiters Series B. The architect of McKinseys Sustainability and Resource Practice said in a statement, “For a decade the planet has needed the kind of repeatable, globally consistent, insurance grade analytics Jupiter now delivers.”

The toolkit that the company pitches does purport to offer new levels of granularity and insight into the kinds of threats climate and weather-related disasters post to government and private assets.
“We predict probabilistically at the asset level… at the loading dock of a warehouse or a transmission box or a hotel on the beach, we determine the actual expected risk in a form that the insurance industry or the risk manager at an organization can use and integrate into their plans,” says Sorkin. 
The company’s process begins with global climate models and then drills down into a specific region which is used as the basis of predicting peril-like events, according to Sorkin.
That goes into a statistical model which translate the predictions into a form that quantifies the uncertainty and in a way that’s tailored to decision makers, he said.
Using APIs from Mapbox, the company can also provide a mapping interface that gives customers visualizations along with a product that lets users see what damage can look like inside of a building through virtual reality and a collaboration with Oculus.
“The strategy was to start with one peril in one place in one market so we started with flooding in Carolinas for the real estate,” says Sorkin. “We have expanded into much broader perils and geographies and market segments.”
For all of the time that Sorkin spends modeling out how cities will meet their doom in one form of cataclysm or another, Jupiter’s chief executive is fairly positive about the prospects for society to withstand the climate threat it currently faces.
“Even with all the bad things that could happen, we dont think the apocalypse is inevitable,” Sorkin says. “The extent of damage is a function of how much people invest in avoiding it over the next decade.”","Whether it’s by flood, fire, or the fury of a storm, climate-related catastrophes are now impacting most cities and towns across the country.

NORIMITSU ONISHI,"At the house, his daughter confirmed that the man, Francisco Madjai Mussengere, had been killed by a collapsing roof, and had died waiting for an ambulance blocked by debris. He was 71, she said, adding, He was able to ride the public bus for free.
His oldest son, Elias Francisco, 39, was busy preparing a simple eulogy. In an old, worn notebook, he had recorded the important dates of his fathers life: 1981, arrived in Beira; 1988, joins the Zion Church; 1991-1999, serves as a church elder; 2016, elected pastor.
He had one wife, the son read, and left behind five children and 28 grandchildren.
The family lived not far from a brick factory where Mr. Mussengere had long worked as a supervisor, said the daughter, Graca Francisco. He had left the capital, Maputo, in 1981 to come to Beira to work at the factory.
But after he retired, the factory owner reneged on a promise to build Mr. Mussengere a proper home, she and her brothers said. Instead, he lived in a tiny cinder-block structure.
The unfulfilled dream of a cozy retirement home gnawed at Mr. Mussengere in recent years so much so that he had instructed his children to keep fighting for a new house in the event of his death.
Now, that house has killed him, Ms. Francisco said.","Nearly a week after southern Africa was hit by one the worst natural disasters in decades, it was all rescue workers could do to try to reach the victims.",2019-03-20T23:15:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Rescuers Battle Flooding in Desperate Bid to Save Cyclone Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/africa/mozambique-cyclone.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/world/20mozambique3/merlin_152347080_0a52cd69-308d-4aab-8299-e8666d2d11c5-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1
"AJ Willingham, CNN","(CNN) It's a sad reality: After natural disasters, there will always be those who want to prey on the displaced, the down-and-out and the desperate. These scams can come in the form of financial investment offers, loan schemes, charitable crowdfunding pages or countless other predatory tactics hidden beneath a veneer of altruism. State and federal officials are warning Hurricane Florence survivors, and those who want to help them, about scams. Here's their advice. Be wary of cold calls and unsolicited messages ""We know from experience that financial predators often take advantage of disasters to peddle their schemes and profit from the misfortune of others,"" Ronald W. Thomas, the director of the Virginia State Corporation Commission's Division of Securities and Retail Franchising said in an SCC release. ""Red flags of hurricane-related scams include unsolicited email, social media messages, crowdfunding pitches or telephone calls promoting investment pools or bonds to help storm victims, water-removal or purification technologies, electricity-generating devices and distressed real estate remediation programs,"" the release reads. The SCC also recommends that people: Delete unsolicited emails or messages Watch out for calls or solicitations that promise quick payouts or results Double check contractors, and get it in writing North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey cautioned survivors against not only falling for scams, but for participating in fraudulent or questionable insurance schemes in hopes of a quick fix. That could land someone in even greater trouble. ""Don't be tempted to conspire in a fraudulent insurance claim,"" Causey said in a release. ""A fraudulent claim could result in your claim not getting paid. And since insurance fraud is a crime, you could end up with serious legal problems."" Causey also provided the following tips: Run all contracts and repairs by your insurance company first Demand references, identification and licenses from any contractors Most importantly, ""get everything in writing."" Watch where and how you donate Even if you're hundreds of miles from where Florence hit, your desire to help could land you in the center of a scam. The Federal Trade Commission has advice on how to avoid sinking your money into illegitimate crowdfunding or charity schemes. Here are some of them: Get detailed information about a charity before donating Watch out for organizations that aren't clear about their mission or where the money is going Avoid cash donations if possible Be wary of ""pop-up"" charity websites or organizations that seem to appear out of nowhere directly after a disaster. The best way to ensure you're not getting scammed? Use common sense, and contact an expert. For givers, the FTC suggests sites like the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance, Charity Navigator and Charity Watch. For survivors and those rebuilding, experts suggest checking with your insurance company or your state's regulator from the North American Securities Administrators Association.","It's a sad reality: After natural disasters, there will always be those who want to prey on the displaced and the desperate.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","When Hurricane Michael flattened entire communities in the Florida Panhandle last fall, most Americans and media outlets responded with an appropriate level of horror and empathy. A few, however, engaged in a pretty ugly form of victim-blaming; observing that the conservative districts that suffered damage voted for politicians who deny climate sciencethe implication being these Americans got what was coming.
At the time, Earther called out this sort of victim shaming as wrong and counterproductive. But we didnt have much evidence for how widespread such attitudes are. Now, a social scientist to whom we posed that question last October has gone and taken a first stab at answering it, and the result is both alarming and unsurprising: A lot of people think this way.
As scientists warnings about climate change become increasingly dire, our conversations about
Read more Read
In fact, roughly a third of Americans who understand that climate change is real and driven by human activities agree with the idea that climate deniers get what they deserve when disasters strike their communities, according to the new research, which hasnt yet been peer-reviewed.
 We were not too surprised though we are a bit disappointed, Matthew Motta, a postdoctoral researcher studying science communication at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author on the study, told Earther.
Motta and his colleagues from Washington University in St. Louis and Emory University used an online survey tool to poll 4,056 individuals. Respondents were first asked to identify their political leanings on a 7-point scale. The poll then asked whether they think climate change is real and human-driven. Those who answered yes were asked whether they agree with the sentiment that people who dont believe in climate change get what they deserve when natural disasters strike.
Of the 54 percent of respondents who were on board with the scientific consensusa fraction that tracks other national surveys but is a bit lower than one published last weekthe authors found that more than a third think climate deniers are getting their due when a hurricane flattens their town or a wildfire engulfs their city. Nearly 70 percent of these victim-blamers identified as Democrats, with more ideologically liberal respondents tending to dish the blame more. 
 While previous research has shown that people who hold strongly partisan views tend to dislike the other side more, this finding takes things a disturbing step further. As the authors put it, a substantial number of Americans are wishing, or at least accepting, physical harm as a sort of political retribution. And lest any right-of-center readers see this as vindication that the libs are a bunch of assholes, Motta pointed out that this sort of victim blaming likely isnt limited to Democrats. 
I think it would go the other way as well, he told Earther, citing violent crime as a potential issue that might engender ill will from conservatives if, for instance, the victim was opposed to carrying weapons. Thats a hypothesis he and his colleagues are planning to explore in future work, but one need look no further than Trumps awful tweets on Californias wildfires for evidence that partisan victim blaming is bi-directional.
While the findings should be taken with a grain of salt until the study is published in a peer-reviewed journal, if the truth is anywhere close to these survey results, its bad news. Not only is it deeply shitty to spit on others suffering, blaming people for their misery is, in Mottas extremely evenhanded assessment, not a solid science communication strategy. Communications experts often cite discussing shared values and common ground as effective strategies when talking about climate change with a skeptical audience. Shaming people for their beliefs is kind of the opposite.
Theres also the reality that those who suffer most from natural disasters generally have the least power to effect change in our global fossil fuel-driven energy system. With only a handful of years left to rein in the worst consequences of a warming climate, the only people we should be shaming are the oneswho got usinto this mess in the first place.","When Hurricane Michael flattened entire communities in the Florida Panhandle last fall, most Americans and media outlets responded with an appropriate level of horror and empathy.

Jonathan Shieber,"Weather and climate-related disasters cost the U.S. economy $80 billion last year — and have hit the nation’s bottom line to the tune of roughly $100 billion per year over the last five years, according to a new survey from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
That tally comes as NASA reported that 2018 was also the fourth warmest year ever recorded — continuing a trend of record-breaking global temperatures.
It looks like the anthropogenic causes of climate change are becoming harder to ignore.
Indeed, the NOAA’s Climate.gov report was very blunt about the causes of the increasing frequency with which natural disasters are occurring across the country:
The past three years (2016-2018) have been historic, with the annual average number of billion-dollar disasters being more than double the long-term average. The number and cost of disasters are increasing over time due to a combination of increased exposure, vulnerability, and the fact the climate change is increasing the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters.
In total, the U.S. was hit by 14 separate disaster events whose costs were more than $1 billion: the litany of climatological horrors included two tropical cyclones, eight severe storms, two winter storms, prolonged drought and wildfires (that probably burned all the partridges out of their pear trees).
As the NOAA report notes, this tally is the fourth highest number of total events ever recorded — behind 2017 and 2011 (tied at 16 natural disasters) and 2015, which saw 15 natural disasters worth more than $1 billion slam the U.S.
Last year was also one of the costliest for the American economy in terms of the impact from natural disasters. The $80 billion price tag is only topped by 2017, when storms, fires, floods and drought cost the economy $312.7 billion (a record); 2005, when the number hit $220.8 billion and 2012 when $128.6 billion was lost due to climate-related disasters.
Of the events that are the most damaging and costliest to the U.S. economy, hurricanes rank the highest. And from 2016-2018 the U.S. was impacted by six separate hurricanes that cost the economy more than $1 billion. In all, those disasters wrought some $329.9 billion in economic damage and killed 3,138 people.
While there’s a tragic, historic precedence for the damage caused by hurricanes, the Western wildfire seasons of the past two years are unprecedented in size and scope in modern history. With costs running over $40 billion, the wildfire costs in the U.S. for the last two years are equal to the cost from fires for the previous 37 years combined.
Meanwhile, NASA scientists have said that the past five years have been, collectively, the warmest years in the modern record.
2018 is yet again an extremely warm year on top of a long-term global warming trend, said GISS Director Gavin Schmidt, in a statement.
Since the 1880s, the average global surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit — and this warming is caused in large part by increased emissions into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, Schmidt said.
The impacts of long-term global warming are already being felt  in coastal flooding, heat waves, intense precipitation and ecosystem change, said Schmidt, in a statement.
It’s important to note that overall global warming contributes to drastic shifts in climate patterns and climate change. It doesn’t mean that there won’t be conditions of extreme cold as (ahem) some people seem to think.
In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People cant last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2019
In fact, global warming hasn’t gone anywhere… yet.
There is a plan being proposed by Democrats in the House of Representatives that aims to push the U.S. to rapidly decarbonize its economy in a bid to offset some of the worst effects that are expected should global temperatures continue to rise (and if anyone wants to send that to me, I’d be obliged).
Given that most reports put a 12-year time frame around reversing the worst impacts of climate change, and U.S. reports put the potential economic damage of unchecked warming at somewhere close to $500 billion, getting a move on toward possible solutions seems like a good idea. Let’s hope Congress can follow through.","Weather and climate-related disasters cost the U.S. economy $80 billion last year — and have hit the nation’s bottom line to the tune of roughly $100 billion per year over the last five years, according to a new survey from the National Oceanic and Atmospheri…",2019-02-06T21:50:12Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","Weather and climate-related disasters cost the US $80 billion in 2018, but go ahead and say climate change isn’t real",http://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/weather-and-climate-related-disasters-cost-the-us-80-billion-in-2018-but-go-ahead-and-say-climate-change-isnt-real/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-28-at-8.53.34-AM.png?w=764,techcrunch,TechCrunch,Natural disasters,1
Annalee Newitz,"Enlarge / This Nilometer at Cairo is an ancient device that Egyptians used to measure Nile flooding, to predict the harvest and set tax levels. Scientists used historical data from Nileometers to see how volcanic eruptions affected Nile floods (and by extension, the health of the harvest). reader comments 1 From 305-30 BCE, ancient Egypt was ruled by the Ptolemaic Dynasty, a Greek family put in place after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt. Though Egypt's wealth and importance were legendary during this time, it was also a period of great civil unrest. Perhaps because they were being ruled by foreigners, the Egyptian people revolted against their leadership several times during the 200s, sparking civil wars. But now scientists believe these revolts may have broken out in part because of a chain reaction started by volcanoes halfway across the world. There's no doubt that the Egyptians were chafing under the yoke of their foreign monarchs. The days of the great pharaohs were over, and leaders from the north were replacing Egyptian culture with Greek gods and architecture. But why did the Egyptians' resentment boil over into open revolt sometimes and remain at a steady simmer otherwise? Historian Francis Ludlow of Trinity College, Ireland, and his colleagues believe that ash, dust, and other particles released by volcanoes during the 200s BCE caused temperatures to cool around the globe. Cooling resulted in less water evaporation, which meant less rain for northern Africa and, therefore, less flooding of the life-giving Nile River. Because the ancient Egyptians were a farming culture that lived and died by the harvest, the annual Nile flood was key to survival. Floods meant nutrient-rich waters fed the fields and everyone could eat. Nile levels were so important to the Egyptian economy that the government based tax amounts on readings from ""Nilometers,"" stone wells fed by the river where they could measure its height in cubits. If the levels were trending too high (destructive flooding) or too low (drought), taxes were scaled back to account for people's diminished fortunes. Years with low rainfall inevitably meant people wanted for more and had less to lose. Gripes with the government became full-scale rebellions, like the 20-year ""Theban revolt"" that started in 207 BCE and the ""Egyptian revolt"" against Ptolemy III between 245-238 BCE. Both came after periods of increased volcanic activity. Though many other factors were in play, there is an undeniable correlation between eruptions and rebellion against the Ptolemaic regime. The volcanic house of cards Ludlow and his colleagues gathered data for their hypothesis from a range of sources. They consulted the historical record to figure out when rebellions and unrest took place in Egypt. In addition, they measured social unrest by looking at when the Ptolemaic government issued new edicts, such as the famous Rosetta Stone (erected during the Great Revolt of 206-186 BCE), affirming the king's power over a restless population. The researchers did this under the assumption that the king would only need to issue such edicts if he felt his regime was threatened. Having established a chronology of uprisings, the researchers went volcano hunting. Volcanoes large enough to affect the climate also leave behind a telltale debris signature of volcanic sulfates in the ice of Greenland and Antarctica. By drilling out cores of ice from these areas, scientists can reconstruct when an eruption took place in the geological record. But could they be certain that these eruptions affected Nile flooding? To answer this question, the researchers returned again to the historical record, observing that eruptions in the 20th century had reduced Nile floods. Another treasure trove of data came from careful records of flood levels measured by keepers of the Islamic Nilometer between 622–1902 CE. By analyzing this data, Ludlow and his colleagues were able to model how much a given eruption would affect the Nile's annual flood cycle. The researchers found a clear connection between volcanic aerosol levels in the atmosphere and weak Nile flooding. University of Hawaii classicist Robert Littman, who was not involved in the study, urged caution when looking at flood levels. He's studied Nilometers extensively and noted that fluctuations in the level of the Nile would have varied greatly from region to region. ""We have texts that say 16 cubits is the ideal level in Luxor. But in the north, in the delta, it's seven cubits."" So there's no guarantee that an eruption would have affected all areas in Egypt the same way. Littman added that we also can't discount political pressures, such as ongoing wars in Syria, as catalysts for revolt. Ludlow agreed with Littman that poor flood seasons were just one part cause for social unrest. He acknowledged the revolts were ""the result of many conditions that happened to coalesce at the right time—these include ethnic tensions, with some resentment bubbling away among the native Egyptian populace against the new Greek elites ruling Egypt after Alexander the Great's conquest, combined with... economic policies enacted by the Ptolemies, such as the decision to move to a great focus on free-threshing wheat—as opposed to other grains that were less vulnerable to drought—because this was the favorite bread grain in the Greek world and could be exported for greater profit."" But, he added, the low flood levels could be a tipping point. ""We frame the volcanic eruptions and the associated failures of the Nile summer floodwaters as triggers because their impact occurs suddenly without warning. There may be decades without a major volcanic eruption, but then one or more suddenly occurs,"" he explained via email. ""Another way of putting it is that you could consider ethic tensions and economic stress as a chronic contribution or cause, while the sudden and short-term shock from a volcanic eruption is an acute contribution of cause."" In other words, the already-troubled Egyptian polity was teetering on the brink. The abrupt reversal of fortunes caused by bad flood seasons pushed them over into armed rebellion. Climate and future social problems There are interesting exceptions. During the 40s and 30s BCE, Egypt suffered greatly from reduced flooding and its attendant perils like mass starvation, plague, and inflation. But Queen Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, managed to quell revolt. She did it, Ludlow said, by ""offering grain relief from state granaries and banning exports of grain."" Volcano-induced revolts were not inevitable. Good public policies could make up for environmental disasters. Ludlow and his colleagues say the climate history of the Nile offers a lesson to cities coping with disaster today. Yale environmental scientist and study co-author Jennifer Marlon noted that ""it is very rare in science and history to have such strong and detailed evidence documenting how societies responded to climatic shocks in the past."" UC Berkeley public policy professor Solomon Hsiang, who was not involved in the study, has spent most of his career showing correlations between natural disasters and long-term socio-economic problems. Over the past several years, he's worked with the Global Policy Lab to show that disasters caused by climate change, such as typhoons and wildfires, can lead to economic downturns from which nations may never recover. Still, speaking at a recent conference, Hsiang said these studies should make us hopeful. ""This is the first time in human history when we have the technology to look ahead at what might come down the road,"" he mused. ""In past societies, leaders relied on fortune tellers to make decisions. We have data and science and analytics that allow us to see what's coming more clearly. So we can make informed decisions.""

Dan Ackerman,"Maybe it's a sign of the current social and political zeitgeist, maybe it's just people trying to cash in on the success of TV shows like The Walking Dead or films like Mad Max: Thunder Road. Whatever the reason, an awful lot of games at E3 2018 deal with the end of the world (or other worlds). Sometimes it's zombies, other times hordes of people infected with some horrible disease that makes them suspiciously zombie-like. If not the undead, then rioting mutants or roving gangs of wasteland toughs. In almost every case, the aesthetic style is filled with the muted browns and greys of collapsed buildings, or the green of creeping vines and vegetation taking back our ruined cities. Whatever the style, it's all part of the current craze for apocalyptic chic, where the only foregone conclusion game developers (and many TV and film producers) seem to be able to agree on is that humankind is toast.

CNN Opinion,"(CNN)In a year dominated by the Trump presidency and the run-up to the midterm elections, readers came to CNN Opinion looking for insight into the ongoing battles raging in Washington and across America. But politicians and policy divides weren't the only headline makers. Stories of gun violence, celebrity deaths, a royal wedding and a series of horrific natural disasters attracted your attention, too.
Here are excerpts from a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2018.
Julian Zelizer: Obama's stern warning for Trump
To say that Donald Trump is not acting presidential is not to romanticize what we have seen from previous inhabitants of the office. But it is to hold him accountable for going far beyond the proper limits on presidential behavior.
The biggest danger is that by tolerating Trump's behavior in office, the public will make what he is doing and saying part of our conception of what it means to be presidential.
It is vital that members of both parties admit what they see when these moments happen and avoid normalizing these kinds of reckless departures from presidential history. For if the political class, and the public, starts to brush these moments off as ""Trump being Trump"" or ""nothing worse than what we have seen"" we will lower the bar so far it will be impossible to ever repair the presidency.
Lucia Brawley: Let's be honest about Aziz Ansari
As a society, we must take this incident -- appearing in the public consciousness during our #MeToo moment -- as an opportunity to have some painful, nuanced conversations.
For example: Sexual assault and rape are never the victim's fault. But we cannot indiscriminately start destroying careers over consensual sexual activity, which based on her account is what this case appears to be.
When we do that, we trivialize the brave victims who are coming forward about actual sex crimes.
Simone Biles: I went from foster care to the Olympics
Although I was young when my foster care ordeal began, I remember how it felt to be passed off and overlooked. Like nobody knew me or wanted to know me. Like my talents didn't count, and my voice didn't matter.
Finding a family made me feel like I mattered. Finding a passion, something I loved and was really good at, made me feel like I mattered. Representing my country and being part of such an amazing Olympic team matters, as does being a role model for those looking to fulfill their own dreams.
Cameron Kasky, Parkland student: My generation won't stand for this
We can't ignore the issues of gun control that this tragedy raises. And so, I'm asking -- no, demanding -- we take action now.
Why? Because at the end of the day, the students at my school felt one shared experience -- our politicians abandoned us by failing to keep guns out of schools.
But this time, my classmates and I are going to hold them to account. This time we are going to pressure them to take action. This time we are going to force them to spend more energy protecting human lives than unborn fetuses.
Peggy Drexler: Why does Melania stay?
But perhaps most important, although divorcing Trump would surely please the ""Free Melania"" crowd, the first lady hasn't really shown that she cares much what other people think of her -- or needs to be saved.
She has not tried particularly hard to win public approval: Besides her scant appearances and botched RNC address, she's become known for wearing the wrong things at the wrong time, like when she donned a pair of Manolos to visit victims of Hurricane Harvey. Which is also why it's perhaps too hopeful to expect that the pressure of these new revelations (which, let's be honest, are likely not new to her) will cause her to leave the life she seems comfortable in -- one that's very clearly sponsored by, if not warmly inclusive of, the President.
Gloria Borger: The great unraveling: Trump's allies are really worried about him
Not since Richard Nixon started talking to the portraits on the walls of the West Wing has a president seemed so alone against the world.
One source -- who is a presidential ally -- is worried, really worried. ...
Even by Trumpian standards, the chaos and the unraveling at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue are a stunning -- and recurring -- problem.
But there's an up-against-the-wall quality to the past couple of weeks that is striking, and the crescendo is loud, clear, unhealthy, even dangerous.
Paul Callan: The lawyer Trump wants to represent him has been dead for 32 years
It's becoming increasingly clear who President Donald Trump really wants to represent him in the Robert Mueller investigation -- and there's a good reason he can't have him.
When John Dowd quit this week as lead counsel on Trump's legal team and the President made an effort to recruit ""deep state"" conspiracy theorist and conservative legal commentator Joseph diGenova to the team, the conclusion could only be that Trump wants to go to war against Mueller, using the tactics favored by his onetime mentor Roy Cohn.
In effect, the President wants to wage an aggressive, and probably dirty war, on the special counsel. Cohn, having died in 1986, isn't available. But there may be other lawyers who can fill that role
Jonathan Wackrow, former Secret Service agent: Barbara Bush's code name was absolutely perfect
As a special agent with the United States Secret Service, I had the opportunity to work on many protective assignments with Mrs. Bush. While I was never permanently assigned to her detail, I am thankful for two specific moments with Mrs. Bush, ones I will cherish as defining experiences in my career and testaments to her legacy, her candor and grace.
The first occurred when I was a new agent, assigned to work a midnight shift at the Bush family's summer residence in Kennebunkport, Maine. I was walking in the front yard at daybreak, preparing to end my shift, when Mrs. Bush suddenly appeared.
In my world, it was better to be unseen, but in this instant, I was in the former first lady's full view with nowhere to hide. Mrs. Bush gave me the warmest smile and said, ""Well, it is good morning for me, but it looks like you have been up all night, so I will wish you a good night's sleep."" Stunned, I thanked her.
Paul Begala: Sean Hannity is a welfare queen
Sean Hannity is a lot of things. Needy isn't one of them. Greedy, in President Reagan's framing, seems more like it. Perhaps the program that guarantees Hannity's investments is a wise one. Perhaps, on the other hand, it is a wasteful welfare program. That's not the point. It's the hypocrisy, stupid.
Hannity is a very wealthy man. So is Donald Trump. It appears that part of the way they became rich was by decrying welfare for poor folks, then grabbing it for themselves. They view their voters, their viewers, as saps. Stooges. Suckers. As another great huckster said, there's one born every minute. And Hannity is laughing all the way to the bank.
Einat Lev: Why Hawaii's volcano is in danger of going ballistic
Everyone has been looking at the Kilauea Volcano's lava flows. Sure, a wall of molten rock consuming a car is quite the sight. But as we all focus on the damage at Leilani Estates, we shouldn't forget that volcanoes are complex systems, where everything is connected. New warnings about flying ballistic blocks and sinking lava lakes help us remember!
This event -- beautiful, destructive, frightening -- also presents a moment for all of us to appreciate the immense power of the forces that never cease shaping our planet. We are reminded by Kilauea to stay humble in the face of nature. And for volcanologists, the eruption is an opportunity to share with the public what we know about how these massive, intricate systems work.
Michael D'Antonio: What Ivanka's smile can't hide
Ivanka's smile was undoubtedly offered to calm concerns about him and, perhaps, to distract from the mayhem and death that any thoughtful person could have anticipated as the embassy opened and Trump abandoned America's claim to honest broker status in the Middle East.
It was the biggest test yet of Ivanka's ability to cast a benign light on a man who regularly creates a shadow too dark for her to dispel.
Ford Vox: What the $%#@ is wrong with you? Of course it's Yanny! (or Laurel)
But if you're shocked by the Yanny and Laurel differences in your own household and social networks, by all means use this as a moment to reflect on what else you might perceive differently, in the political messaging swirling around us.
Illusions like this fascinate us because they reveal there is a gap between what we perceive to be true and what actually exists. It's baked into our biology; we're equipped with brains that spend far more of their energy and devote far more network activity to processing and changing what we sense. Nothing gets in that isn't dramatically altered before it reaches our conscious awareness.
All knowledge is a feat of human interpretation. These periodic revelations that we see things differently are one of the all-too-fleeting healthy forces of social media, reminding us that we have to work together if we're going to get things right.
Isha Sesay: Biracial, American and now a duchess: Meghan leaves mark on monarchy
In a short period, Meghan Markle has ushered in a new sensibility and made the world recalibrate how it thinks about this family we thought we already knew so well.
The Duchess of Sussex chose to make her wedding day a moment where the world tuned in and were made to think about racial equality and gender equality. She made a decision to send the world a message.
It was a decision she made with her husband and with the blessing of the members of her new family. And it was powerful.
Hilary George-Parkin: What Kate Spade modeled for young women -- and their moms
There's a reason Kate Spade's work appealed just as much to a generation of 12-year-old girls as it did to their moms. At its core, it made the case that femininity, creativity and a sense of playfulness weren't qualities you needed to give up or hide away in order to be taken seriously in the world -- that, in fact, they should be celebrated. It was an idealistic notion, but the woman at the helm, who built what would become a multibillion-dollar brand on boxy handbags and polka-dot prints, was all the proof we needed.
The idea that whimsy should have a place in the workplace, that ""sophisticated"" doesn't need to mean ""staid,"" that prints should be mixed and colors can be clashed, were, in many ways, ahead of their time. In an industry of dark sunglasses and status handbags, she embraced an unapologetically pretty, preppy, East Coast aesthetic, turning it on its head in the process.
S. Nathan Park: US-North Korea friendship would be the perfect bulwark against China
In short, North Korea is in serious need of a military and economic counterweight against China -- and the United States can serve in that capacity. True, it is distasteful to be friends with a regime responsible for massive human rights violations. Yet pragmatism is a longstanding tradition in US foreign relations. Just consider that Mao Zedong was on the short list of history's greatest monsters, but Richard Nixon shook his hand.
Pragmatists would look beyond the present conditions and examine how a friendly relationship with North Korea would serve the long-term US national interest. With the rise of China, East Asia is far and away the most important region in the world for the United States. If the United States could count North Korea as a friend, it would be adding a friendly state located at the doorstep of China.
Dean Obeidallah: Why Sarah Sanders was asked to leave a restaurant
Those shocked by these types of protests simply don't grasp the level of emotion that many who oppose Trump feel. I hear it nightly on my SiriusXM radio show and see it firsthand on social media. Even Trump, in a rare moment of honesty, told his supporters a few weeks ago that those who oppose him are not just angry, but ""really, really angry."" Many view Trump as a true threat to America.
So, it should come as no surprise that some would also look to hold members of Team Trump responsible as well. After all, Trump administration officials who defend Trump's bigoted policies, his demonization of minority groups and his lies, are complicit. They freely choose to do the work for him and they shouldn't be shocked if some -- not all --Trump opponents lash out at them.
David Axelrod: Annapolis victims worked hard and honorably to serve their community
No, the shooter apparently wasn't motivated by politics. But the victims died because the newspaper faithfully discharged its obligation to cover the news. So this slaughter should give us pause to reflect on the essential role of the journalist in our society.
They work hard to get the straight and unvarnished facts to us, to shine a light in dark corners and make sure we know what is going on in our communities, our country and the world.
It is a mission to which they commit themselves, often for little money and sometimes at great risk -- even, as we now know, in the newsrooms of local papers.
LZ Granderson: I forgave my father for walking out on me. I hope he forgave me, too
I've been poor and rich. I've been another face in the crowd and a face on television. Inside a crack house and a guest at the White House. And at each junction of my life, the demons regarding my father followed. They had an open invitation courtesy of the anger I kept in my heart. It wasn't until my son asked why hasn't he ever met his grandfather that I realized how foolish I had been.
I wasn't trying to protect my kid. I was trying to punish an absentee father, losing sight of the fact that forgiveness isn't for the offender, but for the offended. 
I went to the nursing home hoping to jog his memory, like a scene from ""The Notebook."" I took my phone out to Facetime, so my son could see and talk to his grandfather for the first time. And I went to the nursing home to say, ""I forgive you.""
Peniel Joseph: France's World Cup win is a victory for immigrants everywhere
In short, the World Cup champions remind us all that, in an era of globalization, racial and ethnic diversity represent an enduring strength at all levels of society, ones that build cultural and political bridges within and between countries. 
For millions of soccer fans around the world, Africa, in effect, just won the World Cup! This is more than just wishful thinking. The makeup of the French team represents a powerful response against building walls and detention centers to detain and dehumanize immigrant populations.
The global debate over immigration is the human rights issue of our time. How are we to treat the women, men, children and families who risk their lives for opportunities that thrive in Western society?
Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Trump and Putin: the pictures tell the story
The meeting in Helsinki, Finland, between two men expert in the art of spectacle intended to intimidate the world, proclaiming that Trump's reorientation of America away from liberal democracy is in line with the intentions of his counterpart, Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The images tell another story: one that gives credence to the belief that Trump's allegiance to Putin goes way beyond ideology. We still don't know the actual reason the summit was held, nor do we know -- yet -- the nature of the hold Putin has over Trump. Yet photographs suggest this was no meeting of equals but an encounter between a supplicant (Trump) and a master (Putin), starting with Putin arriving late to their public encounter, setting it about 45 minutes back.
Manisha Sinha: What happened the last time a President chose America's enemies over its friends
Donald Trump likes to compare himself to Andrew Jackson, but the Andrew he really resembles is Andrew Johnson. What they have in common are delusions of personal grandeur and a tainted ascent to the presidency. Trump was elected by a minority of the American electorate, with help from the vagaries of the Electoral College system and from considerable Russian interference.
Johnson became president thanks to an assassin's bullet. While Johnson immodestly compared himself to Jesus and Moses, Trump claims he is the best at everything, even boasting recently on Twitter that his popularity among Republicans exceeds that of Abraham Lincoln. ...
But the resemblance between the two men goes deeper. Johnson's white supremacist views were blatant and his policies precipitated a constitutional crisis that put the President at loggerheads with Congress and his own party, the Republicans.
SE Cupp: What Laura Ingraham said was awful. And unsurprising.
To many, that sounded racist. That's because it is. She isn't complaining that the country's getting older or younger, richer or poorer, that we're having more or fewer children or moving to the suburbs. She's complaining that people who come to America from other countries -- even legally -- are making this country unrecognizable to her. Indeed, to ""us.""
Who ""us"" means is also clear: Fox News viewers, who are predominantly 65 and older and white. I know many of those viewers, and I'm sad to say that message probably resonated with a lot of them.
Timothy Stanley: What it tells us that John McCain drank vodka with Hillary Clinton
John McCain once took on Hillary Clinton in a drinking contest. It was at a restaurant in Estonia in 2004, during a congressional tour. Both politicians managed four shots of vodka; the rules were unclear, but Clinton -- McCain's one-time political rival -- was declared the winner, according to the restaurant proprietor (though in her own account, Clinton said they ""agreed to withdraw in honorable fashion,"" rather than name a winner).
That image sums up the humanity and character of the late Sen. McCain, who will be mourned deeply on both sides of the political aisle. He embodied a more moderate brand of conservatism -- one that could separate politics and friendship -- that now feels distant and very much missed.
He should have been elected President in 2000, when he ran for the Republican nomination and lost, and if he had made it to the White House, America might have forged a new consensus around a smaller state and a cleaner politics.
Today the country is divided in ways that McCain despaired of. But it should be united in grief for a genuine American hero.
Joshua Geltzer: How to prepare for ex-President Trump
No one knows how Trump will leave the Oval Office. Maybe he'll resign. Maybe he'll be impeached. Maybe he'll be voted out in November 2020 -- or maybe he'll leave at the end of two terms in January 2025.
But however he becomes an ex-president, it's impossible to imagine Trump following in Richard Nixon's post-presidency footsteps -- ones that literally traversed empty beaches in a solitary existence. Whether Trump leaves of his own accord after eight years or is abruptly cast out by a vote of the Senate or Electoral College, he is not one to go quietly into the night.
Remember: This is the only presidential candidate in recent memory who refused, even when he appeared to be on the brink of losing the election, to commit to accepting the outcome of the vote. In a career that's careened from real estate to reality TV to politics, there's been one constant: a thirst for more attention.
Danielle Campoamor: Ariana Grande reminds us women have no safe place in America
After Grande's performance, the Rev. Charles H. Ellis III wrapped his right arm around Grande, pulled her close to him and touched her breast. He did this on stage, in a church, during a funeral -- in front of thousands of attendees. Visibly uncomfortable and tense, Grande forced her way through awkward laughs as to not make a scene at the Queen of Soul's eight-hour funeral. ...
The majority of us have felt what Grande undoubtedly felt on that stage: the undeniable fear that accompanies a violation; the need to keep everyone around you happy while you're internally screaming; the cultural expectation to keep smiling while your bodily autonomy is wholly dismissed.
To watch it play out at a funeral is not to be shocked by what you've witnessed, but to be reminded that women -- no matter how powerful or famous -- are not granted the same public safety as men.
Marianna Spicer Joslyn: I was Anthony Bourdain's 'censor' at CNN
Like his viewers, I fell in love with Tony. He was a brilliant writer and storyteller, and you saw his toughness and sensed his vulnerability. His team at ZPZ are the most gifted filmmakers I have seen in a long, long time. His shows were brilliantly shot, directed and edited, always. His writing was poetry, although his friends say he denied being a poet.
I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate and will miss my small part in this program. And my small connection with one of the most brilliant storytellers of our generation. I will miss his voice. I already miss his voice.
I have no claim to being more distraught over Tony's passing than any of his fans, and not in the same league as those who knew and worked with him. But like those who did know him well, I am really angry at his loss, and deeply sad. His kind won't come our way again.
Rebecca Wanzo: These images of women around Kavanaugh evoke a familiar alibi
This choice is an extension of a strategy we have seen even before the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh emerged late in the confirmation process. Kavanaugh stands poised to be the justice who will cement an anti-abortion rights court. With images of him with his wife, daughters, law clerks, and young female basketball players, he is framed as a man who supports women and their futures. (Kavanaugh has vigorously denied the allegations.)
They were front and center in the hearings -- a visual counterargument to the idea that women's lives and bodies are not safe in his hands. Now that some women have accused him of assaulting them, the images are even more important. The happy, shining faces of these teenage girls are meant to inspire trust.
Images sell the idea that these girls have been safe in his hands. How could anyone imagine that this man, trusted and loved, would hurt them? And if he has not hurt them, how could he have hurt any other young woman?
Jennifer Taub: Brett Kavanaugh and I have a lot in common
We both were raised with conservative politics and attended elite prep schools. We both are religious, with deep faith and a belief in God. We both attended Yale in the mid-1980s. We both, aside from occasional binge drinking, worked hard in school and wrote for the student newspaper. We both studied at Cross Campus Library. We both managed to get into top-tier law schools. He Yale, me Harvard. Although we shared similarities, I do not recall ever meeting him at Yale.
But there is one place where our similarities end, and that has made all the difference in our lives. While Brett Kavanaugh appears to have moved fluidly from his beer-drinking prep school days into his beer-drinking college years, I was not as fortunate.
In early fall of my freshman year at Yale, I was raped by an upperclassman. Until that moment, I had expected to maintain my virginity until I was married, or at least until I fell deeply in love. Some of the details are forever seared into my memory, like they were in Christine Blasey Ford's.
Nic Robertson: The world's leaders may regret laughing at Donald Trump
It was also a laugh that the world -- or at least its leaders -- had at the expense of President Trump.
Beginning his speech at the United Nations General Assembly this week, Trump didn't appear to expect the humorous interlude as he launched into a recital of his achievements in office to date.
There was no serious stumble, but a short pause, perhaps taking in what was happening. ...
The lesson for UN delegates who may have laughed is this: Hope you don't get found out.
President Trump likes respect. He won't forget. And he may get the last laugh.
Kelley Paul: My husband, Rand Paul, and our family have suffered intimidation and threats 
Earlier this week, Rand was besieged in the airport by activists ""getting up in his face,"" as you, Sen. Booker, encouraged them to do a few months ago. Preventing someone from moving forward, thrusting your middle finger in their face, screaming vitriol -- is this the way to express concern or enact change? Or does it only incite unstable people to violence, making them feel that assaulting a person is somehow politically justifiable?
Sen. Booker, Rand has worked with you to co-sponsor criminal justice reform bills. He respects you, and so do I. I would call on you to retract your statement. I would call on you to condemn violence, the leaking of elected officials' personal addresses (our address was leaked from a Senate directory given only to senators), and the intimidation and threats that are being hurled at them and their families.
In response to Paul's op-ed, Jeff Giertz, Sen. Cory Booker's communication director, wrote a piece explaining the context of Booker's words. 
Jeffrey Sachs: Trump's failure to fight climate change is a crime against humanity 
President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and others who oppose action to address human-induced climate change should be held accountable for climate crimes against humanity. They are the authors and agents of systematic policies that deny basic human rights to their own citizens and people around the world, including the rights to life, health and property. These politicians have blood on their hands, and the death toll continues to rise.
Trump remains in willful denial of the thousands of deaths caused by his government's inept, under-funded, and under-motivated response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year. The image that will remain in history is of the President gleefully throwing paper towels for a photo op as the people of Puerto Rico around him suffered and died of neglect. In September, Hurricane Florence claimed at least 48 lives, with more likely to come in its aftermath. Last month, Hurricane Michael claimed at least 32 lives, with more than a thousand people reportedly still missing. The final death toll will likely soar in the months ahead as the residual consequences of the storm become more clear.
Kate Maltby: Pray that you don't win the billion-dollar lottery
This week, the winners of two high-rolling lottery jackpots may get to live out their own big-spending fantasies. Tuesday's MegaMillions drawing stands at $1.6 billion and Wednesday's lesser Powerball is still no snip at $620 million. There isn't even a promise of alien invasion to cut short the spending window.
But in life, as in fiction, there's always still a catch. Is an overnight windfall of this magnitude really worth the hassle? Earlier this year, a New Hampshire woman sued for the right to retain anonymity while claiming her Powerball prize of $560 million. Most states still consider the identity of lottery winners a matter of public record.
If that sounds like a price worth paying for a half a billion-life change, bear in mind the number of lottery winners who've met grisly ends after the news of their winnings spread.
Tim Naftali: The midterms put our system against the Agitator in Chief
Historically, the balancing against power in Washington has happened despite the fact that too many of us view elections -- especially midterms -- as spectator sports or don't care about them at all. How this can be in a country that prides itself on the blessings of liberty is a question for another time. But what if this healthy cycle of rebalancing is broken in 2018 despite two years of Trumpian chaos, disrespect for large swathes of our society and daily contempt for dissent?
With only a matter of days to go, the outcome of the struggle in the current three-person race among center-left anger, Trumpist rage and widespread apathy remains remarkably TBD. If our Agitator in Chief's 2018 Provocation Tour falls short, Donald J. Trump will be the clear loser and our constitutional system the winner. But if he manages to cheat history, our political system will face its strongest stress test in the modern era.
Van Jones: 16 reasons to be excited about the midterm Rainbow Wave
In this election, we witnessed the end of two years of one-party rule and the beginning of a new Democratic Party: younger, browner, cooler; with more women, more veterans and the ability to contest and win races from the deep South to the Midwest. ... I call this torrent of inclusive populism ""The Rainbow Wave."" Here is why I am excited about this peek into the future of our nation and the Democratic Party:
1. Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, both Democrats, will be the first Muslim women in the House of Representatives.
2. Sharice Davids of Kansas and Deb Haaland of New Mexico, also Democrats, will be the first Native American women in the House of Representatives.
3. Colorado Democrat Jared Polis will be the nation's first openly gay governor. Sharice Davids, mentioned above, is also part of the LGBT community. Democrat Kyrsten Sinema still stands a chance of being the first openly bisexual senator.
Don Lincoln: A dark matter hurricane is headed our way
According to a recent paper, the Earth is caught directly in the crosshairs of a cosmic hurricane. A swarm of nearly 100 stars, accompanied by an even greater amount of dark matter, is aimed directly at our stellar neighborhood and there's nothing we can do to stop it; in fact, the vanguard is already upon us. This sounds like a perfect summer blockbuster movie, starring The Rock and Chris Pratt, or maybe Scarlett Johansson and Charlize Theron.
Except this is for real. But is it a danger? Well, actually, no. Not at all. But it's potentially incredibly fascinating, with lots of interesting scientific interconnections.
Marcus Mabry: America faces a crossroads after George H.W. Bush's death
Agree or disagree with Bush's politics, it is his profound decency that is his legacy. Just one example: Read his letter to Bill Clinton after he lost the 1992 election. That dignity and decorum is, perhaps, the greatest difference between Trump and his predecessors.
That decency deficit is what has led a handful of Republicans to repudiate Trump's politics and tone -- and many more did so before he was the party's nominee.
But today's Republican Party is the party of Trump, not the party of Bush.
And America is at a crossroads. The suburban vote in the midterm elections suggested that many swing voters reject Trump's divisiveness. But do they accept the burdens of global leadership that George H.W. Bush embraced?""
Elie Honig: Mueller is about to have his say -- in a big way
Throughout his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, special counsel Robert Mueller has imposed on his team an ironclad rule: Nobody leaks and nobody speaks -- out of court, that is. But when it comes to official court filings -- indictments, plea agreements, sentencing memos -- Mueller has been loquacious and at times downright chatty, disclosing in compelling narrative fashion crucial details about his investigation and giving tantalizing clues about what might happen next.","In a year dominated by the Trump presidency and the run-up to the midterm elections, readers came to CNN Opinion looking for insight into the ongoing battles raging in Washington and across America.

LEAH C. STOKES,"We say the extreme rain caused this disaster. We say it was the fire. And we say that multiple years of drought didn’t help. But what caused the rain, the fire and the drought? There is a clear climate signature in the disaster in Santa Barbara. We know that climate change is making California’s extreme rainfall events more frequent. We know it’s worsening our fires. We know that it contributed substantially to the latest drought. There are simpler stories we could tell. Stories with more proximate causes: Those people bought in dangerous places. Those people should have left their homes. Those people are somehow to blame. These events are normal. These things just happen there. But these simple stories mask a larger truth. How many times do we need to hear adjectives in their superlative form before we spot a pattern: largest, rainiest, driest, deadliest? Records, by their nature, are not meant to be set annually. And yet that’s what is happening. The costliest year for natural disasters in the United States was 2017. One of the longest and most severe droughts in California history concluded for most parts of the state in 2017. The five warmest years on record have all occurred since 2006, with 2017 expected to be one of the warmest yet again. I have researched climate change policy for over a decade now. For a long time, we assumed that climate policy was stalled because it was a problem for the future. Or it would affect other people. Poorer people. Animals. Ecosystems. We assumed those parts of the world were separate from us. That we were somehow insulated. I didn’t expect to see it in my own backyard so soon. Climate change devastated ecosystems, species and neighborhoods in Houston and much of struggling Puerto Rico last year. Now climate change has ravaged one of the wealthiest ZIP codes in the country. We know now that even the richest among us is not insulated. These extreme events are getting worse. But when I read the news after each fresh disaster, I rarely see a mention of climate change. Whether it’s coverage of a fire in my backyard or a powerful hurricane in the Caribbean, this bigger story is usually missing. To say that it is too soon to talk about the causes of a crisis is wrongheaded. We must connect the dots. Climate change helped cost my friends’ businesses’ revenue. Climate change helped put my community in chaos for weeks. Climate change paved the way for lost lives next door. If climate victims here and across the globe understood that carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels played a role in their losses, perhaps they would rise up to demand policy changes. We know this could happen because research from the political scientist Regina Bateson, now a congressional candidate in California, shows that being a crime victim can spur people into activism. Perhaps some of the people affected by the fires in California, the hurricanes in Puerto Rico and Texas, and the drought in the Dakotas will be similarly motivated. Maybe some of these climate change victims will become the climate policy champions we sorely need. It is never too soon after one of these disasters to speak truth about climate change’s role. If anything, it is too late. If we do not name the problem, we cannot hope to solve it. For my community, as much as yours, I hope we will.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Last week, federal scientists released their damning new National Climate Assessment, which warned that if action is not taken to stop global climate change, the U.S. will suffer greatly from consequences including dwindling water supplies, sea-level rise, epidemics, natural disasters, and billions of dollars in damages. It also noted that storms, wildfires, floods, hurricanes and other extreme events are already being worsened by warming average temperatures. Donald Trumps administration has tried to undercut its own scientists with tactics like burying the report on Black Friday and dispatching spokespeople to spread blatant lies about its methodology and conclusions. But if you want to hear what the big man himself has to say, a Tuesday interview with the president in the Washington Post is, really, incredibly painful to read. The Posts Josh Dawsey asked Trump, You said yesterday when you were leaving that you were skeptical of a climate change report that the government had done. Can you just explain why youre skeptical of that report? The presidents response was less an answer than an unedited stream of consciousness, with Trump touching on everything from from his very high levels of intelligence and the incredibly dirty air invading the U.S. from China, Russia, and South America to how oceans are very small compared to the atmosphere. Trump also doubled down on his comments that the president of Finland, Sauli Niinisto, told him that wildfires could be prevented by rakingsomething Niinisto said never happened as well as brought up the possibility that maybe the Earth is actually about to enter a new Ice Age. Trump began by explaining his theory that U.S. water and air is record clean, but other countries are incredibly dirty. And when youre talking about an atmosphere, oceans are very small... It blows over and it sails over: One of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence, but were not necessarily such believers. You look at our air and our water and its right now at a record clean. But when you look at China and you look at parts of Asia and when you look at South America, and when you look at many other places in this world, including Russia, including just many other places the air is incredibly dirty. And when youre talking about an atmosphere, oceans are very small. And it blows over and it sails over. I mean, we take thousands of tons of garbage off our beaches all the time that comes over from Asia. It just flows right down the Pacific, it flows, and we say where does this come from. And it takes many people to start off with. Pollution is bad. Smog and garbage are bad. But shifting the focus to particulate exposure, water contamination, and literal garbage that supposedly comes over from Asia is a deliberate distraction from greenhouse gases, which are the drivers of rising average global temperatures. This attempted sleight of hand relies not only on redefining industrial greenhouse gas emissions as somehow not pollutants themselves but ignoring that Trumps administration has launched massive attacks on regulations and agencies responsible for safeguarding the environment. Also, hes full of it on how clean the U.S. air and water is. Barely missing a beat, Trump then suggested that since hed heard of articles talking about global freezing beforedoubtlessly referring to some brain poison hed ingested via Fox News scientists couldnt be trusted beyond rare points of agreement like that there is movement in the atmosphere. He then turned the subject back to bad forest management, which virtually all experts have said is not the cause of the devastating California wildfires: Number two, if you go back and if you look at articles, they talked about global freezing, they talked about at some point the planets could have freeze to death, then its going to die of heat exhaustion. There is movement in the atmosphere. Theres no question. As to whether or not its man-made and whether or not the effects that youre talking about are there, I dont see itnot nearly like it is. Do we want clean water? Absolutely. Do we want clean air to breathe? Absolutely. The fire in California, where I was, if you looked at the floor, the floor of the fire they have trees that were fallen, they did no forest management, no forest maintenance, and you can lightyou can take a match like this and light a tree trunk when that thing is laying there for more than 14 or 15 months. And its a massive problem in California. In any case, forest management is just the presidents euphemism for environmentally destructive logging. Finally, Trump reaffirmed that he still likes the way raking rolls off the tongue in a conclusion so rambling it isnt worth addressing. But here it is anyhow, if you wanted to have a spontaneous aneurysm: Josh, you go to other places where they have denser trees its more dense, where the trees are more flammable they dont have forest fires like this, because they maintain. And it was very interesting, I was watching the firemen and theyre raking brush you know the tumbleweed and brush and all this stuff thats growing underneath. Its on fire and theyre raking it working so hard, and theyre raking all this stuff. If that was raked in the beginning, thered be nothing to catch on fire. Its very interesting to see. A lot of the trees, they took tremendous burn at the bottom, but they didnt catch on fire. The bottom is all burned but they didnt catch on fire because they sucked the water, theyre wet. You need forest management, and they dont have it. This kind of stuff is nothing new coming from Trump, who lives so far in his own reality that he is still insisting the existence of winter proves the planet isnt heating up. But that shouldnt make it any less alarming, or frankly offensive to the countless people the National Climate Assessment projects have faced or will face severe consequences from a warming climate. At a time when wildfires linked to climate change-worsened droughts are wiping swathes of California off the map and extensive damage to U.S. ecosystems is already occurring, the president cant be bothered to understand the issue. He really cant even be bothered to learn what the climate is, exactly, beyond some kind of thing that has to do with air. Facts arent something we need to believe to make them truewe treat them as optional at our peril, Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe told the Post. And if were the president of the United States, we do so at the peril of not just ourselves but the hundreds of millions of people were responsible for. Texas A&amp;M University atmospheric sciences expert Andrew Dessler was more blunt, telling the paper How can one possibly respond to this? He added that Trumps remarks were idiotic.

Jacquelline Fuller,"In September last year, a large earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Within hours, a tsunami hit Palu, the provincial capital. Over two thousand lives were lost, making it the deadliest earthquake in 2018. Google.org and Googlers around the world responded by donating $1 million to support relief efforts led by Save the Children and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. We also rolled out our crisis response alerts and tools to provide emergency info those impacted. 
This earthquake was only one of more than 2,000 disasters to strike Indonesia last year. Altogether, the government has estimated that these disasters affected some three million people, causing billions of dollars in damages and a tragic loss of life. Unfortunately, 2018 was not an anomaly and we know that Indonesia will continue to be challenged by natural disasters. At Google.org, we look to help nonprofits on the frontlines of global crisis through funding and volunteers. But we also believe in supporting solutions that could help mitigate the impact of future crises.

Through this grant, theyll implement a national awareness campaign using online and offline platforms to ensure that schools are safe and children are better prepared for emergencies.

Haley Samsel,"It's no secret that we've had a rough fall and winter with natural disasters. Even as we write this, fires burn in Southern California, adding to the previous wildfires in the northern part of the state that burned over 245,000 acres in October. Hurricanes Irma and Harvey devastated communities across Florida and Texas, while touching communities in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, the Carolinas and Louisiana. The U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were devastated by back-to-back hurricanes Irma and Maria. Amidst the trauma and destruction, school districts across the U.S. have shouldered a heavy burden: trying to help their students catch up after missing days, weeks and even months of class time. Across nine states, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, at least 9 million students missed some amount of school this fall due to a natural disaster, according to an NPR Ed analysis. The analysis compiled missed days from individual public school districts affected by natural disasters as well as estimates given by state education departments. In Florida, 2.6 million kids missed at least one full week of school, according to our analysis. Overall, the state's students missed an average of 5.78 days. About 2 million students in Texas also missed at least one school day. The hardest hit? School districts near Corpus Christi, a coastal city on the Gulf of Mexico. Some students there were out for several weeks. Elsewhere: Aransas Pass, a Texas district serving about 1,800 students, didn't re-open until Oct. 16; that's 34 days after schools were originally closed. Compare that with Houston, where schools reopened 10 days after Harvey. In Southern California, many schools near Santa Barbara have been closed for the last two weeks, with plans to reopen after the new year. And those numbers pale in comparison to Puerto Rico. An estimated 345,000 students on the island were affected by the disaster, missing several weeks of school. Many students have left to live with relatives and attend school in the states, particularly Florida and New York. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, where roughly 13,000 students missed weeks of classes, most schools are now open, with the exception of a few that have been ""condemned"" by the islands' education department. All this lost time, of course, is likely to have an impact on student achievement. A fairly new metric in education, chronic absence, is defined as missing more than 10 percent of the school year — just two days a month. Lots of research has shown that such students are way more likely to fall behind and, eventually, drop out. Especially for those in early grades, where the emphasis in school is placed on learning to read. After third grade, students are expected to read to learn, but if the foundations aren't there, they can struggle. Under the new federal education law, 36 states plan to use some measure of chronic absence to measure school success. And while missing school from a disaster is not the same as chronic absence — after all, all the students are absent from school, the hit on learning time is vast. In the aftermath of these disruptions, some districts are taking creative measures to make up for missed class time. The Manatee County schools in Florida, with almost 49,000 students, added 10 minutes to every school day from Oct. 2 to Dec. 20, along with a shortened Thanksgiving break. Many districts say they have enough class time built into their calendar that the missed days won't keep them from meeting requirements. In other places, though, the time lost is just too much to make up. In Texas and Florida, state education commissioners have waived several required days due to the extreme nature of the disasters. In Texas, those lost days — or weeks — have worried educators in several districts, who are asking the state to delay testing dates or suspend testing requirements altogether. As it stands, Texas' fifth- and eighth-graders, as well as high school students, must pass state tests to advance to the next grade or graduate. Most superintendents of districts affected by Harvey say they do not want to delay state tests in the spring, but they're worried that the state will evaluate their districts harshly due to low test scores. ""We don't mind taking the exams, but we don't want to be... publicly humiliated over something we had no control over,"" Joseph Patek III, superintendent of the hard-hit Aransas County school district, said during a state legislature meeting on Nov. 14. Districts across the country could be grappling with this same spring testing issue, when missed class time catches up with students and teachers still dealing with the trauma wrought by natural disasters. For now, in Texas, the state education agency says it will take into account how many students and staff were displaced and how classrooms were disrupted when deciding on accountability.","Wildfires, hurricanes, flooding — this fall has brought a wave of natural disasters to the U.S. With that comes many days where schools are closed — and those absences add up.",2017-12-15T10:49:06Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Natural Disasters And The Implications Of Missing So Much School,https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/12/15/564058043/natural-disasters-and-the-implications-of-missing-so-much-school,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/12/01/disasters_wide-cdff79d31e52349d887e4b3c8e8ccd21be949179.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,Natural disasters,1
Leigh Anderson,"Last week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report a klaxon, reallywarning of the catastrophic consequences of climate change if global political leaders dont take action right now. For people whove been sounding the alarm for decades now, this report is depressing but not surprising; for those of us whove not paid as much attention to the science as we should have, the report is a blaring wake-up call. No matter which group youre in, though, the path forward is clear: We need to pressure our elected leaders, corporations, and even our friends and neighbors to change our ways or we will be witnessing rising sea levels, natural disasters, war, famine and a refugee crisis the likes of which the world has never seen. As the New York Times writes, the world must utterly transform its energy systems in the next decade or risk ecological and social disaster. The first thing that someone can do, says Michael Brune, the executive director for the Sierra Club, is to remember that you have power. In the face of enormous, apparently intractable social problems, individual action can seem puny and inconsequential. (And indeed, just 100 companies are responsible for 71 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which can make your rinsing out your tuna cans seem like an absurd bit of private theater.) But collectively we actually can slow climate change: The first thing that someone can do, says Michael Brune, the executive director for the Sierra Club, is to remember that you have power. As a citizen, a consumer, an investor, as a human being, you have the power to effect really great change. Heres how to get started. By 2030, we as a collective 7 billion humans will know our fate, or at the very least, the fate of Read more Read Know Where Your Elected Officials Stand If you think that everyones pretty much on board with the fact of climate change, youre in for a rude awakening: More than half of Congress are climate-change deniers (and are largely, but not exclusively, Republicans). Want to see how enlightened your rep is on the issue? Check out this handy list of all the climate-change deniers in Congress. You know the drill: Call, write, email, protest, and above all, vote. Communicating with the people that are supposed to represent you in government can sound like a Read more Read Focus on State and Local Government Municipalities, collectively, might be able to do more than Washington. After President Trump decided to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, a coalition of mayors pledged to meet the targets anyway. As Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City who coordinated the effort, writes in the Times, More than 130 American cities have joined the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, and all are determined to see that we meet our Paris goal. Start going to your city council meetings, or at least follow the reporters or environmental advocates who are covering those meetings. Does your city have a sustainability office or a committee on the environment? Does your local university have a sustainability office you can communicate with about local efforts? If you truly turn up nothing, check out the Climate Resilience Toolkit for step-by-step instructions on addressing climate change in your community. Who you vote for for mayor, or whos on your city council, is really important, says Brune. If you want your community to be powered by clean energy, you need to vote and agitate at the local level. The world is warming. Theres no longer any doubt of that. With a new report breaking down exactly Read more Read Brune also points out that governors who believe in and are addressing climate change have made more economic opportunity for their constituents: see New Jersey, Illinois, California, Massachusetts. So hold your governors feet to the fire and volunteer for the candidates you think have the best handle on the climate change/economic-opportunity intersection. For a quick way to check out how a federal candidate leans, go to the Sierra Clubs endorsement page. For state and local races, contact your local chapter of the Sierra Club some states offer legislative scorecards. Take Action Yourself The very first thing you have to do is take action yourself, says David Miller, the North American regional director for the C40 cities climate leadership group. When you talk to your elected officials and they ask, well, what are you doing? you want to have a ready answer. Do you take transit? Can you make choices in your own personal transportation? If you drive, can you take transit even one day a week? If you take transit, can you walk more, can you bike more?...Can you choose an electric vehicle over a gas-powered vehicle? Miller acknowledges that your personal action will depend on your personal circumstances, but that collectively these decisions can have a huge impact. A new report from the United Nations offers a terrifying and stark forecast of the immediate Read more Read You can ask yourself the same questions about dozens of relatively small lifestyle choices: Can you eat a more climate-friendly diet? Can you cut down on meat and animal products? (This doesnt have to mean going fully vegetarian or veganyou can just go reducetarian. Really, if you can just limit or eliminate beef and pork youd be doing a lot. ) Can you waste less food and compost the scraps? Food waste is a huge contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Is there a compost program [in your community? says Miller. Can you organize with others to push your municipal representatives to do something? Can you stop with all the disposables? I love a ziplock bag and a big cup of coffee as much as the next parent, but I try really hard to use reusable containers for lunches and to bring a to-go cup for coffee. If you want to get fanatical about never buying something, make it bottled water, a scourge upon the planet. Can you, in general, just buy less stuff? Especially plastic toys, for kids, which arent usually recyclable and arent in play for very long, anyway. The holidays are comingwhat if you gave and asked for experiences instead of things? Youd probably be happier. Can you make your home more energy-efficient ? Can you find out if your workplace is energy-efficient? If youre thinking about buying a new car, can you test drive a Bolt or a Prius ? Do you really need a car at all? Can you lobby for better transit and cycling lanes in your town or arrange a car pool with fellow commuters or parents? Who are you doing business with? Dont support banks that arent investing in solutions, says Brune, specifically calling out Bank of Americas support for fracking. Switch to a socially responsible bank. If you have investments, consider impact investing. Want more ideas, from the very easy dont put stuff on your car roof? to the even easier replace your lightbulbs? Check out these suggestions from the Natural Resources Defense Council. These efforts might seem inconsequential, like rinsing out the tuna cans, above, but if youre also leaning on your friends and neighbors, and your employer, and your local government, small actions will start to snowball. And regarding those 100 companies that are the big villains in climate change, Miller points out that changing your behavior to not support environmentally-damaging sectors of the economyby, for example, choosing public transit over carsyou are effecting change. Youre making choices with your pocketbook. A million small choices add up. For the one thousandth time, an authoritative new report tells us with great certainty thatif we Read more Read Influence Your Friends and Neighbors Speaking up actually matters, says Miller. Building a political movement requires knowledgeable, engaged people who work together on an issue. If fighting climate change is your new passion, or even your old passion, dont keep it to yourself. And you dont have to take a finger-wagging tackstart with the positive: So many things are happening that are inspiring, says Miller. This is a movement that is based on making lives better. You can talk about how great electric cars are now, or how much youre enjoying the health benefits of cycling and dont want to be hit by a car (this is my personal strategy) or how cities around the world are buying fleets of electric buses. There are about a million reasons why we should eat less meat, considering its effects on our own Read more Read Its important to influence our elected officials, of course, but as the saying goes, there go the people. I must follow them, for I am their leader. Changing representatives minds means changing their constituents minds. The most important thing to influence elected officials is a general understanding amongst people that something is the right thing to do, says Miller. This is also where Facebook activism comes ineven if youre just posting about what changes individuals can make, you might influence someone to re-think what kind of car they need, or even if they need a car at all. This doesnt have to mean scare-mongering or guilt-trippingkeeping a positive and helpful tone is critical. The posts from friends that make me listen usually involve events, like fundraising bike rides or postcard-writing partiesfun things that make activism social. Were doomed is not going to inspire anyone to do anything. The earth is getting warmer. Thats a fact. And as the earth gets warmer, we expect to see larger Read more Read Start With Your Personal Interests and Your Own Community I confess that while I have always been aware of climate change and vaguely hoping that politicians would do something, it hasnt been my number-one issue. But lately Ive gotten into cycling, and so follow a lot of transportation-alternatives types on social mediawhich has changed how I think about cars, transit, and cities...which in turn has changed what I talk about with friends. A lot of people come to this topic through their own personal perspective, says Brune: grandparents who want their children to have a future that isnt impoverished because of climate change, parents and teachers who organize to have a strong science-based curriculum in schools. Brune says, A lot of people may be more conservative politically, but they run a company or theyre active in the private sector, and want to make an economic argument in favor of taking action on climate change....We have seen people who organize through their church, to make a moral argument for why we should take stronger action in favor of clean energy. Weve seen all these things be effective in their own right, but when they are coordinated together, you have a cacophony of voices all calling for stronger leadership. So are you into education? Check out Climate Parents, follow the National Science Teachers Association, and attend your local school board meetings to find out what the science curriculum is in your kids school. Are you into gardening? Research how to get started with composting. Catholic? Read what the Pope has to say on climate change. (Jewish? Covered. Episcopalian? Covered.) Are you an engineer or architect ? Are you an African-American person who wants to get into camping, or a Latino person who wants to connect with nature ? Are you queer and interested in backpacking ? I am going to guess that no matter your identity, hobbies, interests, or passions, you can hook up with some group that is enjoying nature and fighting climate change. My personal next steps? Start going to my local meetings about transportation alternatives, and re-considering my banking. If youre stumped, look for your local chapter of the Sierra Club, or just find your greenest friend on Facebook and ask what to do. Weve got a decade to turn things around, so pour yourself a coffee in a reusable mug, make yourself a vegetarian snack, and start planning.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Pyongyang has seen record temperatures North Korea says a heatwave is threatening a ""natural disaster"" and has called on its citizens to help protect crops from drought. The Korean peninsula is experiencing record temperatures and South Korea has reported 28 deaths from the heat. In the North, which has previously suffered bouts of famine, state media warned that key crops such rice and corn were under threat. It called on citizens to ""join the struggle"" to safeguard harvests. ""This year's high temperature is an unprecedented natural disaster but it is not an insurmountable difficulty,"" it said. ""Officials and working people in all fields and units... should turn out as one and devotedly work out of patriotism in the campaign to prevent damage by high temperature and drought,"" an editorial in the state-run newspaper Rodong said. ""All people should fully display their patriotic zeal in the ongoing campaign."" State news agency KCNA said irrigation equipment was being urgently repaired and new wells and reservoirs created. ""Myriads of water carriers, tractors, trucks and other vehicles have been involved in irrigating croplands together with all the available watering equipment and devices,"" it said.

The South's capital, Seoul, also recently recorded its hottest ever temperature at 39C. Earlier this year, the head of the UN's World Food Programme made a rare visit to North Korea and said the country was working hard to meet nutritional standards. David Beasley spent two days in the capital, Pyongyang, and two outside it, accompanied by government minders. He said levels of hunger were not as high as in the 1990s. Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have died in a widespread famine in the North between 1994 and 1998. ""I didn't see starvation like you had in the famine back in the 1990s, that's the good news. But is there a hunger issue, is there under-nutrition? There's no question about it,"" he told the BBC.

BeauHD,"Over the last few years, dozens of studies have investigated the influence of climate change on events ranging from the Russian heat wave of 2010 to the California drought, evaluating the extent to which global warming has made them more severe or more likely to occur. The Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society now issues a special report each year assessing the impact of climate change on the previous year's extreme events. Interest in the field has grown so much that the National Academy of Sciences released an in-depth report last year evaluating the current state of the science and providing recommendations for its improvement. And as the science continues to mature, it may have ramifications for society. Legal experts suggest that attribution studies could play a major role in lawsuits brought by citizens against companies, industries or even governments. They could help reshape climate adaptation policies throughout a country or even the world. And perhaps more immediately, the young field of research could be capturing the public's attention in ways that long-term projections for the future cannot. In 2004, Allen and Oxford colleague Daithi Stone and Peter Stott of the Met Office co-authored a report that is widely regarded as the world's first extreme event attribution study. The paper, which examined the contribution of climate change to a severe European heat wave in 2003 -- an event which may have caused tens of thousands of deaths across the continent -- concluded that ""it is very likely that human influence has at least doubled the risk of a heat wave exceeding this threshold magnitude."" Before this point, climate change attribution science had existed in other forms for several decades, according to Noah Diffenbaugh, a Stanford University climate scientist and attribution expert. Until 2004, much of the work had focused on investigating the relationship between human activity and long-term changes in climate elements like temperature and precipitation. More recently, scientists had been attempting to understand how these changes in long-term averages might affect weather patterns in general.","In 2003, the predominant view in the scientific community was that there was no way to determine the exact influence of climate change on any individual event.

John Timmer,"Enlarge / For a prepper, this is badly undergoing it. reader comments 7 ""Prepping,"" or getting ready to live without societal support, is apparently a largely American activity, and a recent one. Companies that cater to people who want to be self-reliant for food, water, and power have grown their revenue by about 700 percent over the last decade, and prepper products are now offered in places like Costco, Kmart, and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. But it's not at all clear what's driving this growth—why are more people getting ready for society's collapse? Some explanations focus on a tendency toward paranoia in American society or fears of terrorism or natural disaster. But actual evidence that directly supports any of these ideas as the main reason is pretty sparse. So Michael Mills at the UK's University of Kent decided to correct this gap in our knowledge. Mills went on an American road trip, spending time talking to (and butchering animals with) 39 preppers in 18 different US states. Rather than rampant paranoia, Mills suggests, preppers are motivated by non stop media coverage of natural disasters, as well as a government that encourages them to prepare for the worst. The sum of all fears To the extent that one exists, the public image of a prepper is of someone who's getting ready for the collapse of society, at which point money and electric grids, along with all the things that depend on them, will become unavailable. Preppers are ready to purify water to drink, hunt and butcher for meals, and scare off anyone who tries to get a piece of their post-apocalyptic bliss, possibly via gunfire. There may be bunkers involved. But that image is fostered in part by the public's biggest route to being made aware of preppers: Doomsday Preppers, which aired on the National Geographic channel. (The show has also infiltrated the academic literature, as Mills cites a study that analyzed the psychology of people who appeared on the show.) Although Mills doesn't explicitly say it, it's reasonable to wonder whether one can get an accurate cross-section of the prepper community purely from watching people who were chosen to appear on the show based on whether they make for good television. To find out, Mills placed ads on some popular prepper websites, recruited his cohort, and started his road trip. His goal wasn't a quantitative study; it was ethnography, which is largely talking to people, spending time with them, and seeing whether there are commonalities in how they think. It's important to note that regardless of how popular these prepper sites are, they probably won't produce a full cross-section of the prepper community, either, nor will selecting people based on willingness to talk to a researcher. That said, you'll still probably get more depth than you would by selecting for great TV. In fact, one of the subjects specifically told Mills that ""it’s not like on [National Geographic’s] Doomsday Preppers."" They weren't preparing for the total collapse of society. They were getting ready to deal with a local collapse of services that might last a few months. It's less Armageddon and more Hurricane Irma—which hadn't hit yet while Mills was doing his interviews but has since suggested that preparing for a couple of months without key services may be badly underestimating needs. Prepper supplies would typically be enough to only hold out that long, and Mills said they often referred to these caches as ""more than they'd ever need."" Another key difference is that the researchers didn't have any specific expectations for a particular disaster that's likely to happen. Some of them lived in flood-prone areas but would invariably mention additional fears like terrorism or outbreaks of new diseases. And for many of them, those risks didn't produce a sense that disaster was inevitable. Preparing was more a just-in-case activity. As Mills concluded, ""Their concerns tend to emerge in response to numerous disaster risks that are widely reported and recognized in wider American culture."" Media and government Tornadoes, hurricanes, fire, earthquakes—there are few areas of the country with no natural disaster risks, and terrorism and disease outbreaks could happen nearly anywhere. So what factors drive some people to respond to those risks by being ready to do without both private and government services or any sort of emergency support? One factor, Mills argues, is that the organizations responsible for coordinating that emergency support tell them they should be ready to deal without it. ""Federal agencies have recently encouraged American citizens to contemplate surviving disasters without their assistance,"" Mills writes, citing a previous study. And the government also warns people to be ready for risks that have never materialized. Since 2003, a group within the Department of Homeland Security has advocated that people ""have a ‘safe room’, duct tape, and plastic sheets on-hand to secure their home against (unprecedented) chemical terrorist attacks."" A second motivation comes from the media, which tends to provide nonstop coverage of natural disasters and their aftermath. Mills said nearly every subject mentioned Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy, or both. Mills' road trip took place in 2004, and Ebola and ISIS both made frequent appearances in the risks mentioned by the preppers (as they might again today). His conclusion, then, is that preppers are responding to what they're hearing: ""prepping is a phenomenon with clear, previously unacknowledged links to broader risk communications and concerns in the twenty-first century United States."" In other words, prepping might be an unusual response to the challenges everyone faces when trying to communicate risks to the public, but it's on a spectrum of responses, rather than being a distinct phenomenon. That, as Mills notes, still leaves a couple of key questions, like why the response is so prevalent in the US, and why plenty of US citizens face the same risks but can't even be bothered to store some jugs of water or pack a go-bag.",Motivations include lots of government warnings and media coverage of disasters.,2018-05-25T14:10:48Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",What exactly are “preppers” prepping for?,https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/05/what-exactly-are-preppers-prepping-for/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emergency_supply_kit-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,Natural disasters,1
"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Crowdfunding campaigns are effective ways for people to help others in need. But news that a couple conspired with a homeless man to create a heartwarming Good Samaritan story to scam people out of money highlights the importance of vetting viral feel-good stories before donating. Mark DAmico, Kate McClure and Johnny Bobbitt Jr. are being charged with second-degree theft by deception and second-degree conspiracy after reportedly creating a fake story about a good deed and raising over $400,000 on the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe. McClure and DAmico claimed that Bobbitt Jr., who is homeless, gave McClure his last $20 when her vehicle ran out of gas. The story picked up tremendous press attention before it began to unravel. GoFundMe said it would refund donors. Pretty much anyone can set up their own campaign, though instances of fraud to this magnitude are rare, according to Consumer Reports. Still, youll want to be careful anytime youre giving money away, particularly around the holidays, when scams proliferate as thieves try to take advantage of peoples good will. Crowdfunding campaigns offer some oversight (and may refund you if you are scammed; read the fine print), but not to the degree that nonprofits and charities do, which means you should be a bit more discerning in the campaigns you support. How to Spot a Scam So, what should you look for when donating money on the crowdfunding platforms? CR recommends donating to people you already know and trust. If you dont know the person, you shouldnt be the first or one of the first to donate. Wait until a few others have donated, and read the comments that are left to see if anything suspicious pops up. If a campaign has reached its stated goal, consider donating elsewhere, as theres no guarantee of where the extra funds will go. In times of distresslike natural disasters or mass shootingsplatforms like GoFundMe will create verified pages with campaigns that the company has vetted itself. This is an extra layer of security. For example, heres a page for the California wildfires. Pets and livestock got separated from their people in Californias wildfires, and rescuers have Read more Read Another tip that weve covered before : Reverse search the campaigns image on Google: If youre using Chrome, just right click the main photo on the GoFundMe page and select Search Google for image. If you see a ton of results, scammers probably stole that photo to use for their fake campaign. Also, check the campaign administrators social media presence, and Google the name of the recipient and complaint, review, rating, or scam, suggests Marketwatch. Avoid pages with little to no information or specifics. Obviously, its not a fool-proof system. People you dont know will continue to need donations for health care, natural disasters, etc., and you should give if you can. Just be a bit more vigilant on sites like GoFundMe so you know that your money is going to a good cause.",Crowdfunding campaigns are effective ways for people to help others in need.

Saqib Shah,"Although, it's difficult to chalk 2017 up as anything other than a lousy year, we can find some solace in the well-meaning ""how"" queries sent Google's way. Aside from an increase in political mobilization (as evidenced in the popularity of ""how to make a protest sign?""), we were asking ""how to help?"" more than ever. Spurred by natural disasters (like the California wildfires), people also looked for ways to help out within local communities by asking how to become firefighters, paramedics, social workers, and activists. ""In these moments and others, our collective humanity shined,"" remarked Google. The company itself marked the year by fully embracing hardware, but (judging by its trends) the Pixel 2 wasn't the handset search users were anticipating the most. That honor went to Apple's iPhone 8 and iPhone X, which came in at second and third place respectively on global search results. Staying on the tech side of things, Bitcoin was also in the mix, as people kept pace with its volatile price surges (while hopefully refraining from splashing their savings on the digital currency). When it came to celebs, the news cycle had us furiously looking up Matt Lauer and other men on the end of sexual misconduct allegations. Harvey Weinstein, on the other hand, whose outing at the hands of a New York Times expose opened the sexual harassment floodgates, wound up at number three. Kevin Spacey and Bill O' Reilly also made the cut. Meanwhile, soon-to-be princess Meghan Markle landed in second place and Gal Gadot just cracked the top ten.

Natt Garun,"As part of Giving Tuesday, Google has added a new Donate button to its knowledge graph when you search for recognized nonprofit organizations. The Donate button allows you to directly contribute money to nonprofits when searching for them on the web, though the organization also has to enroll with Google for the button to appear. (I checked through large organizations like the American Red Cross, UNICEF, Planned Parenthood, and Feed The Children, but did not find the buttons available yet.) Unlike Facebook’s Charitable Givings feature that has gotten popular with users who “donate” their birthdays to fundraising, Google does not charge a fee when donations are made through its button. (Facebook charges 5 percent for donations made within the US.) However, for Giving Tuesday, Facebook says it is working with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to match up to $2 million in donations, and it will waive the usual 5 percent fee for contributions made this on its platform today. Facebook is also expected to hold a Social Good Forum in New York City on Wednesday, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be in attendance. According to Google, about 30 percent of charitable donations occur during the holiday season. Its hopes are that the new donate button makes it easier for online shoppers to consider giving, though it is currently live for US-based charities at this time.

NICOLE STEPHENS,"During survey interviews, survivors who stayed focused on interdependence, emphasizing themes of sticking together, religious faith and communal and family ties. In fact, over two-thirds of those who stayed explicitly discussed the importance of connections to others. “We had a good community” one Katrina survivor in the New Orleans area said. “All the people here help one another.” Another said, “I was worried and not only for myself, but for a lot of the people.” As critics of storm holdouts may suspect, nearly half of those who stayed also discussed the importance of being tough or strong in the face of hardship, but this was never the sole factor. The silver lining of residents weathering a dangerous storm with one another is visible in the ways communities come together in a chaotic aftermath to share boats, food, and emergency supplies. Such acts of neighborly bravery have been caught on camera, or retold on social media, during ad hoc rescue operations for multiple hurricanes. These benefits may especially resonate with working-class Americans, who are more likely to think of themselves as part of a broader social network, with responsibilities to vulnerable neighbors; in contrast, members of the middle- and upper-class, who tend to evacuate, are more likely to think of themselves as independent families, free to come and go as they please. Considering the government’s slow and inept response to recent natural disasters, it is not surprising that people — especially those in working-class and minority communities — frequently do not trust the government’s disaster preparation. When the sentiment that the government doesn’t care about “people like us” is widespread, the likelihood of those people complying with mandatory evacuation orders drops. Like Hurricane Katrina before it, the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, in 2017, was a tragic reminder that our government desperately needs to improve its ability to respond effectively to the immediate and long-term needs of citizens who endure natural disasters.","Jay Allen swam in the pool at his residence in Garden Beach, S.C., on Thursday, having decided to ignore an order to evacuate the day before Hurricane Florence makes landfall.",2018-09-14T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why Do People Stay When a Hurricane Comes?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/opinion/hurricane-maria-staying-home.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/opinion/14nicolestephens/14nicolestephens-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1
Natasha Lomas,"Move over Twitter, President Trump now has the power to send every phone in the land a simultaneous message — thanks to the new “presidential alert”, tested by FEMA yesterday. What’s it for? The idea is to enable the president of the United States to warn the nation of major threats — such as a natural disaster or terrorist attack. FEMA did already have the power to mass text US phones, via the National Wireless Emergency Alert System devised by the Bush administration in 2006, which has been used for sending alerts about national emergencies like weather events or missing children at a local level. But now the system has been expanded to allow for the White House to compose and send its own ‘presidential alert’ to all phones in a national emergency situation. There is no opt-out. Repeat: No opt-out. Fortunately Congress did limit the substance of these alerts — to “natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters or threats to public safety”, further stipulating that: Except to the extent necessary for testing the public alert and warning system, the public alert and warning system shall not be used to transmit a message that does not relate to a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster or threat to public safety. But bearing in mind the ‘rip it up’ record of the current holder of office of the president of the US, there are no copper-bottomed guarantees about how ‘threat to public safety’ might be interpreted by president Trump. So it remains a slightly mind-bending concept that the president could, say after a 3am binge-watch of his favorite TV show, fire out an alert entirely of his framing to EVERY US PHONE. Technology is indeed a double-edged sword. Here are a few ideas of presidential alerts we really hope Trump won’t be sending… an accidental photo of a body part after he couldn’t figure out how to use the system and hit send accidentally a text message intended for his son-in-law “Donald Trump” covfefe an even worse spelling mistake, e.g. mangling the name of another world leader — like French president “Manuel Macaroon” actual insults directed at other world leaders, e.g. suggesting Emmanuel Macron has a dandruff problem threats of thermonuclear war an unfortunate spoonerism, e.g. ‘the rockets are cot numbing’ a love sonnet to president Kim Jong-Un encouragement to Russia to hack political opponents’ emails a recipe for a “beautiful” chocolate cake his golf handicap an affiliate link to a brochure of Trump Tower US stock market numbers investment advice an affiliate link to buy The Art of The Deal any other book recommendations at all a love sonnet to Ivanka Trump a claim that the hurricane isn’t actually as bad as FEMA’s alert says it is #MAGA “Lock her up” “His testimony was very credible, very credible” “You also had some very fine people on both sides” any claim about the size of the crowds at his inauguration any claim about historical precedence and what his administration has achieved all forms of self congratulation his thoughts on the UN his thoughts on NATO his thoughts on the EU his thoughts on China his thoughts on the Queen anything at all about women “Melanie” all insults about “the failing New York Times” a heart emoji + the words “Tucker Carlson” any text that includes the words “Fox &amp; Friends” any text that includes the phrase “America first” a photo of Melania reclining on gilt furniture, in a gilt room, with some gilt statues a selfie with anyone, especially Nigel Farage any text written in ALL CAPS any text ending with the word “Sad!” his travel itinerary for his next trip to the Winter White House a love sonnet to president Putin ‘exciting’ real estate opportunities credit for Brexit a threat to Twitter not to shadowban conservative voices “You’re fired!” “Build the wall!” “Mission accomplished!” anything at all about president Obama all sports commentary anything containing the word “winning” his thoughts on climate change his thoughts on environmental protection his thoughts on the safety of radioactive substances a list of reasons why the Iran deal was a mistake his thoughts on anything at all to do with the rest of the world a photoshopped picture of Justin Trudeau to make him look ugly diet advice travel advice fashion advice complaints that Google is biased anything about tax — unless it’s his own tax returns a message to Peter Thiel asking him to come back a message asking where the nearest KFC is a message asking where he left his last bucket of KFC a really boring and slightly blurred photo of the inside of Air Force One any message about anything at all he saw on TV last night “Ha-ha you can’t opt out!” “Genius” his thoughts","Move over Twitter, President Trump now has the power to send every phone in the land a simultaneous message — thanks to the new “presidential alert”, tested by FEMA yesterday.

AJ Dellinger,"The old adage about a lie traveling halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on has been made true thanks to Twitter. According to a new study, the vast majority of people using the platform during disasters and breaking news events spread false information without ever getting it a second thought. Researchers at the University at Buffalo examined more than 20,000 tweets sent during Hurricane Sandy and the Boston Marathon bombing. In their findings published in the journal Natural Hazards, they revealed between 86 to 91 percent of the users spread misinformation by retweeting or liking tweets, and less than one in five people tried to correct the falsehoods. The researchers honed in on four specific widespread, false rumors that made the rounds during the two major events. It found that Twitter users often expressed little to no skepticism when presented with those bits of fake news—most just clicked like or retweet and moved on. Just five to nine percent of people sought to confirm the information by asking if it was correct, while as little as one percent of users expressed doubt or said the original tweet was inaccurate. Even once the tweets were debunked by trustworthy sources, users made little effort to make sure their followers were properly informed. Less than 20 percent of users clarified the false information with a new tweet, and less than 10 percent bothered to delete the tweet. “These findings are important because they show how easily people are deceived during times when they are most vulnerable and the role social media platforms play in these deceptions,” Jun Zhuang, the study’s lead author, said in a statement. The findings of the University at Buffalo seem to jibe with an MIT study earlier this year that found false news stories were 70 percent more likely to be retweeted than true stories. MIT researchers also looked at tweets from the Boston Marathon bombing and found that facts took six times as long to reach 1,500 people as it does for falsehoods. Much has been made of fake news since the 2016 presidential election, and companies like Twitter and Facebook have been urged to take action to prevent malicious actors from hijacking the platforms and using them for misinformation campaigns and propaganda. The problem is, it’s often regular, everyday people spreading fake news with no real regard for whether it’s real or not. Social media platforms make it easier to spread that information, but people are inherently drawn to headlines that are sensational and cause an emotional rise. Often times, those stories just aren’t true. Facebook has gone through a number of iterations in its attempts to limit the spread of fake news on its platform, occasionally to disastrous results. At one point the company placed red warning labels on debunked articles to discourage people from spreading them. That upset users who believed the stories to be true and resulted in the articles being shared even more. Social media companies like Twitter and Facebook play a weird role here. They enable the spread of information, both real and fake. It just so happens users are much better at spreading the fake stuff, and now the companies are being pressed to serve as fact-checkers and gatekeepers when that was never their express intent. Social networks need to do better, sure. But so do the people who use those platforms.

RON NIXON,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security transferred nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a budget document released by a Democratic senator late Wednesday night, diverting funds from the relief agency just as a major hurricane barrels toward the East Coast. The document, which was released by the office of Senator Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, shows that the money would come from FEMA’s operations and support budget and was transferred into accounts at ICE to pay for detention and removal operations. The document also shows that the Department of Homeland Security transferred money from accounts at Customs and Border Protection that pays for border fencing and technology. Mr. Merkley, appearing Tuesday night on “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC, said the Trump administration was taking money from FEMA’S “response and recovery” and “working hard to find funds for additional detention camps.” Mr. Merkley has been a vocal critic of the administration’s immigration policies. The Department of Homeland Security denies that any money transferred came from FEMA’s disasters relief accounts, which pay for work related to hurricanes and other natural disasters.",The Department of Homeland Security denies that the money came from disaster relief accounts and says it is prepared for a hurricane that will hit this week.,2018-09-12T11:57:32Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","$10 Million From FEMA Diverted to Pay for Immigration Detention Centers, Document Shows",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/us/politics/fema-ice-immigration-detention.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/13/world/13dc-fema/13dc-fema-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1

"Meghan Moravcik Walbert on Offspring, shared by Meghan Moravcik Walbert to Lifehacker","Although federal workers whove gone all month without a paycheck during the government shutdown are expected to be paid this week, diaper banks are still working tirelessly to distribute diapers to their families.
Officials at the Diaper Bank of North Carolina expect to distribute an extra 200,000 diapers to families during the months of January and February, largely because of the government shutdown that left many federal employees scrambling to pay for basic living expenses. 
We know that many of our states workers are already living paycheck to paycheck, says Michelle Old, Executive Director of DBNC, which operates three regional branches and also distributes feminine hygiene supplies and other personal care items. Going without pay, even for a short period, places these families in a vulnerable position.
Diaper banks typically stay stocked in part through corporate partnerships, in part through local diaper drives and in part through monetary donations. Right now, those monetary donations are as important as ever for diaper banks to be able to stay stocked to help families already in need, in case of natural disasters and in preparation for another potential government shutdown.
Every day we hear from federal workers who are having to choose between paying for housing and heating or having enough diapers for their children. Old says. The need for support is at a critical level and will continue for some time as families try to regroup and get back on their feet.

"Emily Lipstein on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Last year, Gizmodo launched Earther, a new website dedicated to the environment, the people and entities working to save or destroy it, and those who will be most impacted by its destruction. Weve survived a lot in the past 12 months, from Scott Pruitts EPA to rising CO2 levels and natural disasters changing the lives of thousands. Its been difficult, but weve also seen resilience, recovery, and people who are doing everything in their power to stand up for their communities and for the planet. On Earthers first anniversary, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on some of our favorite stories from the past year, covering everything from hot sauce to open skies, and everything in between. We hope you stick around for our next year, and beyond, as we continue to bring you coverage of the fight for the planet, through the midterms and beyond. After years of painstaking acoustic measurements, Gordon Hempton identified this spot on Washingtons Olympic Peninsula as the quietest place in the U.S.the spot most free of our man-made noise pollution. He has nurtured this square inch, guided people to it, and protected it from encroaching cacophony of our modern world. But now it faces its biggest threat yet. As I stood listening to bird calls, leftover rain dropping from higher parts of the canopy, and creatures scattering in the underbrush, a plane flew overhead like static in the middle of a sonata. Later David Youngberg, one of my fellow hikers and a former Navy mechanic, will tell me it was likely a Growler, one of the Navys loudest jets. Flights of these planes are ramping up over Americas quietest place, turning a secluded spot on the Olympic Peninsula into a playground for wargames. Americans devote 70 hours, annually, to pushing petrol-powered spinning death blades over aggressively pointless green carpets to meet an embarrassingly destructive beauty standard based on specious homogeneity. We marvel at how verdant we manage to make our overwatered, chemical-soaked, ecologically-sterile backyards. Thats just biblically, nay, God-of-War-ishly violent. To understand the sheer inanity of devoting 40 million acres, nearly half as much land as we set aside for our biggest crops, to an inedible carpet, we need to back upbeyond the modern lawns origins with a real estate family peddling the American Dream as Whites-only cookie-cutter suburbsto the evolution of grass. But I cant talk about any of these things without first addressing how lazy and short-sighted it is for Americans to allow the Pacific Northwest to be logged routinely for disposable paper products. You know what I mean: the paper cups many of us dont even reuse over the course of a single barbecue, the quilted napkins we rest our phones on because were afraid of café tables, and yes, the toilet paper upon which we wipe our butts. Lastly, I want to tell you to save up and buy a bidet. Two and a half miles east of Aileen Román Rodríguezs home in Arecibo, Puerto Rico lies the Battery Recycling Company Superfund Site, a 16-acre former lead-smelting facility that shut down in 2014, after the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed its 20 years of operations had resulted in toxic levels of heavy metals at and around the site. It flooded during Hurricane Maria, too. Whats clear is that the Battery Recycling Company Superfundand other industrial sites like it around Arecibocontinue to threaten Rodríguez and her community, in ways that natural disasters will only exacerbate. Even though its only 152 feet above sea level at its peak, Avery Island is one the highest points in the Gulf Coast. A two hour drive west of New Orleans, it sits atop an enormous salt dome that bulges from the earth, elevating the land above the swamps and bayous that surround it. A generation ago, it was unthinkable that this natural fortress could be overcome by water. But Hurricane Ritas threatening surges were a symptom of an immense shift in the Gulf Coast, the result of decades of harsh land use practices and climate change. Now, the McIlhenny are fighting to save the island to which their family history and business are inextricably linked. Back in Torrey, Utah, Bendingfield-Smith, who fought for her town to become a designated Dark Sky community, looks at the stars above her home every single night. As night falls on a cloudless night, the sky is revealed to be brimming with stars, she says. The stars are so bright here, like you can reach your hand out and touch time, she told me, referring to the eons-old light of distant stars and galaxies, which is clearly visible in the very dark sky. It just reminds us where we are, who we are, and that were just a small part of something a lot bigger than us. From academia to activism, more and more people are recognizing that gang violence is an environmental health issue and should be treated like one. Were finally at a place where the science is catching up with the anecdotal information that weve had for years, Mustafa Santiago Ali, the senior vice president of climate justice at the Hip Hop Caucus, told me. If the big players in the environmental movement took on the issue of gang violence, environmentalism could accomplish far more in terms of cleaning up communities. The idea that some lives are worth protecting and others are not is kind of the core issue of environmental justice, Julie Sze, an American Studies professor at the University of California at Davis, said. The new AMNH exhibit may choose to focus on the science, but we dont have the luxury of abstaining from getting political about climate changeits always been a political issue, even before Scott Pruitt graced the EPA with his presence. Although theres an argument to be made that a permanent exhibit in a museum shouldnt feature newsy information that could quickly change (such as the beliefs and behavior of our elected officials), above all else, a museums role is to educate the public. Discussing the realities of our worldmessy human politics and alldoesnt reduce a museums credibility. It shows the institution is dedicated to spreading truth, no matter where that truth comes from. Today, the Legendary Sirens take to the water at Floridas Weeki Wachee springs once a month to remind visitors that once a mermaid, always a mermaid. But 71-year-old Rita Kingss performance serves another purpose, as well. She becomes a mermaid to teach visitors about the threats the spring is facing from pollution and development. As a Native womanpart-Hopi and ZuniKings relationship to Mother Earth, as she describes it, is rooted in her culture and in a sense of self-preservation. Weeki Wachee took 40 million years to form, but in just 40 years, its flow has decreased by more than 10 million gallons of water a day. If the flow were to stop, the spring would cease to exist. It would dry, and, ultimately, it would die. Like other so-called geoengineering schemes, Direct Air Capture, where scientists capture human-emitted CO2 and stop it from escaping back into the atmosphere, makes big promises that will require major investments before it can be realized. And whether or not the technology can be scaled up, its no panacea for climate change. At its core, though, the idea is alluring for its simplicity. Its a waste management problem, Klaus Lackner, the Director of the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions at Arizona State University, told Earther. Its about picking up the litter we have left in the street. Earther traveled to Sanibel Island, Florida to check out the biggest shell show in America. Exhibitors showed off their collections, competed for prizes and swapped shelling stories and knowledge at the 81st edition of the Sanibel Shell Show. Thousands of locals and tourists, some of whom came just for the show, shuffled through the rows of exhibits. You cant do what we do if you dont love shells, Mary Burton, the co-chair of the Sanibel Shell Shows artistic division, told Earther. Verdict: true. Virtually every type of locomotion has spawned a hobbyist community, from tinkerers who build their own cars to moonlighting aerospace engineers who fly their own ultra-light aircraft. But somehow, the idea of a homemade sub feels even more unusual and dangerous than taking to the skies in a DIY-plane. There are endless numbers of hazards at the bottom of the ocean, John Wiltshire, the director of Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory at the University of Hawaii at Manoa told Earther. He named just a few, including getting stuck under a ledge, trapped in a cave, or simply becoming so mesmerized with your surroundings you forget to keep an eye out for danger. Those hazards havent deterred a niche community of DIY-ers from trying to explore the ocean on their own, without insurance or the aid of an expensive, certified vehicle. In this context, its easy to understand why the those at the America First Energy conference have fear in their hearts. This is final death rattle, and Donald Trump is the only thing standing between them and a new age of progress. And they know it. The Donald J. Trump administration is perhaps our last political chance at freedom, Tim Huelskamp, Heartlands director, said in his closing remarks. Since 2017, Native Hawaiians have been restoring taro patches, also known as loi kalo, as part of a federally-designated estuarine research reserve with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Through this partnership between government, community groups, and academia, participants hope to revive an ancient sustainable land management system to improve the regions water quality. But if the project proves successful, it would do more than that. It would demonstrate that traditional knowledge can help tackle some of Hawaiis most pressing environmental challenges, from collapsing coral reefs to invasive species.","Last year, Gizmodo launched Earther, a new website dedicated to the environment, the people and entities working to save or destroy it, and those who will be most impacted by its destruction.

You might remember founders Andrea Sreshta and Anna Stork from season six of ABC's Shark Tank back in 2015. Though their idea was simple enough — an easy, efficient way to provide light during emergencies — their product was anything but ordinary. LuminAID's inflatable lanterns use solar panels to convert natural sun rays into bright light, plus they can float, so they're the perfect tool for first responders after natural disasters. Check out the video: But while LuminAID's lanterns could be great for lengthy camping trips and fun pool parties, Sreshta and Stork have always put philanthropy at the forefront of their business. When disaster struck Nepal in 2015, LumindAID provided over 3,000 lanterns as part of its Give Light Nepal campaign. Then, when a string of hurricanes hit Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and more two years late, leaving many without food, shelter, water, or power, LuminAID was once again ready to rise to the occasion. Sreshta and Stork traveled to Puerto Rico with Convoy of Hope to provide relief to those impacted. Convoy of Hope served over 2.5 million meals and 215,000 families, while LuminAID pledged an unprecedented 50,000 solar lights and chargers for those in need.

Andrew Freedman,"President Trump's first official State of the Union speech began with a reminder of the disasters that have befallen Americans during the past year, from wildfires in California to three of the top 5 most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history. ""We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined,"" Trump said. ""We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine."" During 2017, the U.S. was struck with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage, which set a new record. It was enough devastation to get attention of the global business and political elite, who in Davos, Switzerland, ranked climate change and extreme weather events as the greatest threat to global security and prosperity. SEE ALSO: Weather and climate disasters cost the U.S. a record $306 billion in 2017 It wasn't enough carnage, though, to get a climate denying president to make basic connections between the disasters befalling his nation, and human-caused climate change. Trump rightfully cited examples of courageous rescuers from Hurricane Harvey in Texas, and the deadly California wildfire season. But he did so totally divorced from the broader context that is raising the risks of more and bigger disasters in the years to come. Instead, he portrayed it almost as just a string of bad luck. Hurricane Harvey rainfall annual exceedance probabilities. Image: noaa. ""We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane,"" Trump said. He also pledged continued assistance to hard hit areas, from California to Florida to Puerto Rico. ""To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands — everywhere — we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always,"" Trump said. His words likely rang hollow in some areas, like Puerto Rico, where FEMA's food and water deliveries stopped on Wednesday, as the agency officially shifts from a crisis to a recovery phase of the ongoing disaster. Nearly half a million people still lack power more than four months after the storm. scientists have made clear, in studies both before and soon after these extreme weather events, that climate change is ushering in a new era of extreme weather But scientists have made clear, in studies both before and soon after these extreme weather events, that climate change is ushering in a new era of extreme weather that requires policies to be put in place that make the country's infrastructure more resilient, and head off the worst consequences of climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, the Trump administration is mounting an all-out assault on not only environmental regulations, from the planned pullout of the Paris Climate Agreement to an executive order rescinding Obama-era protections mandating that infrastructure plans take sea level rise into account. The administration's new infrastructure plan would also gut the environmental review process for approving new roads, bridges, tunnels, and more, including reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, not to mention the changing risks of so-called ""100-year"" floods. Simply put, climate scientists nearly unanimously say that the climate of our grandparents is gone, and what was a 100-year flood is now occurring far more frequently as the climate warms. The fact that Trump is causing us to lag behind the shifting climate risks more damage from floods, wildfires, and hurricanes. Take Hurricane Harvey, for example, a storm so full of superlatives that meteorologists are still trying to wrap their heads around it. According to a recent assessment from the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Harvey which made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 storm in late August, was the most extreme rainstorm ever recorded in the U.S. The maximum rainfall total was a staggering 60.58 inches near Nederland, Texas, with 18 locations seeing more than 4 feet of rain during the course of a few days. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a large portion of the Houston area saw a 1,000-year or greater flood, meaning that it had a chance of less than 0.1 percent of occurring in any given year. But those odds are deceiving, because the probability of precipitation and heat extremes is rising in many locations as human activities belch more planet-warming greenhouse gases into the air. there was nothing purely natural about the disasters that befell this country in 2017 According to research by Adrian Borsa of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which was discussed at a scientific conference in December, ground-based GPS sensors even detected an overall sinking of southeastern Texas by up to 1.5 centimeters under the sheer weight of the rainfall. The GPS network provided an estimated total size of the rainfall of about 24 to 34 trillion gallons of water, Borsa said during the Annual Meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Studies published since Harvey have shown that the storm's rainfall totals were made more likely due to global warming, since warming air and ocean temperatures have resulted in greater amounts of water vapor available for storm systems to tap into. One study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that climate change likely increased Harvey's total rainfall in the Houston area by about 38 percent, and boosted the chances of observed rainfall by a factor of about 10. Other studies published since the storm, which have also focused on the changing odds of such an extreme flood event, have also found sizable increases in the risk due in large part to global warming. The aftermath of a firestorm that struck Santa Rosa, Calif., seen on Nov. 5, 2017. Image: george rose/Getty Images This year was also a terrifying preview of what may be to come for Californians, as a warmer, drier climate brings the ingredients together for fast-moving, large wildfires. This year's wildfire season was California's worst on record, with communities like Santa Rosa and Montecito now synonymous with disaster. Wildfire dangers, like flooding damage, are also intertwined with myriad development decisions that are putting more Americans in harms' way. For example, Houston is now wrestling with their longtime lack of zoning regulations, and how that worsened the flooding from Harvey. If Trump truly wants to be ""with"" us, as he said in his speech on Tuesday night, he could start by admitting the obvious — there was nothing purely natural about the disasters that befell this country in 2017, and his policies are only putting us in more danger for many years to come.","President Trump's first official State of the Union speech began with a reminder of the disasters that have befallen Americans during the past year, from wildfires in California to three of the top 5 most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history.

"Robin George Andrews on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Indonesia is reeling from a series of geologically-triggered disasters. While it was still assessing the fallout from Augusts deadly Lombok earthquake, a major earthquake on September 28 triggered a tsunami that slammed into Central Sulawesi. According to the latest UN reports, this disaster robbed at least 2,010 people of their lives, with 700 still reported missing. The tragedy in Sulawesi may be falling out of the news cycle, but the recovery efforts there are now in full swing. For emergency responders, the hard work of getting supplies, shelter, healthcare and education to those in need is just beginning. It hasnt been easy. The population is in shock, to be quite frank, Susan Mangicaro, the Indonesia response management team leader at International Medical Corps, told Earther. The quake, tsunami and associated landslides in late September destroyed or severely damaged 67,000 homes, leaving 330,000 people without proper shelters. Marc Vergara, chief of communications for UNICEF, said that entire neighborhoods in Central Sulawesi have simply vanished, literally erased from the map. Tens of thousands of displaced people are being packed into temporary emergency shelters where limited aid can be administered. State officials with Indonesias national disaster management authority (BNPB) and the military are leading the recovery efforts. Right now, those officials are still working out what type of aid needs prioritizing and who might be best placed to help hand it out. Meanwhile, international NGOs and local partners that have received permission to work alongside the BNPB are working round the clock to fill in the gaps and do what they can. Maya Kroitoru, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee s director of operations for disaster relief and development, told Earther that upon arrival in Sulawesi in the days following the tsunami, the scene was desperate and grim. The population is in shock. She described how people lacking food and water plundered aid trucks, how the bodies of the dead were still scattered along the road, and how her team of aid workers waited in line for seven hours to enter the city of Palu where the full force of the tsunami struck. She described the city as paralyzed. Several weeks later, getting help to the afflicted sites is still proving immensely difficult. The airport at Palu was extensively damaged, and roads leading to the city are covered in mudslides. Journeys that should take 8-10 hours are taking 20-25 instead, according to Mangicaro. The dire situation has been exacerbated by heavy disruption to the regions already sub-standard infrastructure. Water and sewerage systems have been knocked out completely in tsunami-hit Palu and Donggala. In plenty of regions, electricity is down and cell phone communications are been extremely limited. The main priorities for all actors on the ground is to prevent further emergencies from happening, Daniel von Rège, the Doctors Without Borders country director for Indonesia, told Earther. Here were talking about mainly reducing the spread of diseases linked to lack of clean water for drinking, washing and cooking. Electrical generators, water purification kits, health servicesboth mental and physicaland the management of vector-borne diseases are at the top of the list. Vergara said that food is now somewhat less of a problem that it was in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, although various aid agencies have said that there are still reports of communities being cut off from basic supplies. UNICEF is working with the Ministry of Education to get kids back to school as quickly as possibleno easy feat after 2,700 schools were damaged. The plan is to set up temporary tent classrooms while training teachers to cater to the children who need their education to continue. Education is a tool for recovery, Vergara said, adding that restoring a sense of normalcy is important. This is difficult for many reasons, including the fact that many residents are now afraid of being so close to the sea. The ocean isnt all they have to fear. During disasters like these, crime rates also rise, exacerbated by the willful spread of hoaxes and misinformation. According to a study by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, gender-based violence can rise following natural disasters, too. And a high number of children have been separated from their families, placing them at risk of sexual exploitation, violence and trafficking. So far, working alongside the Ministry of Social Affairs, UNICEF has helped to identify 61 such children, and three have been reunited with their parents. Sadly, many are feared to have been orphaned. As is always the case, these disasters didnt affect everyone equally. It is the very vulnerable and poor who are most in danger when these disasters strike, Kroitoru said. People fear being forgotten once the cameras are gone. Plenty of NGOs hire local staff, as they know the affected population, language, customs and culture best. Sadly, some of those local aid workers have been swept up in the disaster too. Mangicaro of International Medical Corps said that one of their in-country aid workers homes was destroyed by the tsunami, but that he and his family were physically unharmed. Immediately after the disaster struck, he began an on-site assessment, even though he had to sleep outside. Its not clear how long recovery will take. Lessons can be drawn from the past disasterslike the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed 230,000 people across 14 countriesbut only to a certain extent. No two disasters are exactly alike. Despite the unknowns, first responders do know that certain things must always be done after a disaster strikes. Building resilience is vital. Training, education and assisting the local population is the best way you can help out, Mangicaro explained. Indeed, although theres a debate as to what extent Indonesias current early warning system may have failed and contributed to the crisis, seismologists have stressed that plays second fiddle to public awareness of natural hazards. Effective safety advice, tailored to the regions specific geology and society, needs to be properly disseminated through community-driven initiatives. Long term, infrastructural reconstruction and restoration will also be vital. In an ideal world, earthquake-proof building codes would be applied and reinforced, and tsunami barriers would be set up in vulnerable areas. This, however, depends entirely on resource availability and the governments willingness to act, both of which are lacking at present in Indonesia. Kroitoru explained that its critical for everyone to understand that the emergency does not end when the headlines recede. People fear being forgotten once the cameras are gone, Vergara said.

RON NIXON,"That left the agency to assume more responsibility, like delivering supplies, a job typically left to the states. Having the agency take on a larger role than what is mandated by the law is never a good situation, Brock Long, the agencys administrator, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee in October 2017. When FEMA is the first and primary responder, and the only responder for many weeks, we are never going to move as fast as anybody would like. Since its founding in 1979, FEMA has been the subject of intense criticism, particularly after its delayed response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The hurricane killed 1,800 and destroyed more than 800,000 housing units, leaving many homeless. The federal government, particularly FEMA, was blamed for many of those issues because the agency underestimated the impact of the storm and did not stock supplies beforehand at designated shelters like the Superdome. In addition, Michael D. Brown, the director of the agency at the time, had relatively little experience dealing with disasters and emergency response. Before joining the Bush administration, he was the commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association and landed his job at FEMA through his friendship with a longtime Bush adviser. That spurred a number of changes at the agency, like mandating that the FEMA chief have experience managing emergencies. The agency also began positioning supplies before natural disasters so that it could get them to those affected faster.","Volunteers inside a Sears store in Chico, Calif., this month helping victims of the Camp Fire receive FEMA aid and other government services.",2018-11-22T17:21:22Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","What FEMA Is Doing, and Not Doing, in Response to California’s Fires",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/us/politics/fema-california-wildfires.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/22/us/politics/22dc-fema1/22dc-fema1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1
Annie Lowrey,"Natural disasters are equalizing forces. Fires torch the homes of the rich and the poor alike. Hurricanes destroy cruise ships as well as decade-old cars. Earthquakes level cities, affecting everyone within. But natural disasters are also polarizing forces. Income and wealth shape who gets hit; how much individuals, insurers, nonprofits, and governments are willing and able to help; and who recovers, as well as to what extent. That dynamic is now evident in Paradise, California, after the Camp Fire, much as it was in Houston after Harvey, Puerto Rico after Maria, New Jersey and New York after Sandy, New Orleans after Katrina, and so many places after so many other disasters, small and large. Across the country, two of the most potent forces in American life—climate change, which portends more frequent and more violent natural disasters, and social stratification—are colliding. And the former stands to make the latter far, far worse. The Camp Fire was all-consuming, incinerating much of the town of Paradise in mere hours. After breaking out in early November, it burned for more than two weeks, killing at least 86 people, destroying some 14,000 homes, and causing roughly $17 billion in insured losses. It was the most destructive wildfire in California history, and one of the worst natural calamities to hit the United States. [ Read: The American South will bear the worst of climate change’s costs ] Chelsea West, a registered nurse, was working a shift at the Feather River Hospital when the fire hit. “I was looking outside the window, seeing the smoke and thinking how strange it was that there was a fire in November,” she told me. “Within 15 minutes things changed—the wind was really strong and we were seeing pieces of charred leaves falling on our campus, not just pieces of ash but things that were still burning.” She helped evacuate the hospital, then got pinned down in flames as she tried to flee with some of her colleagues. “It was pitch black at eight in the morning,” she said. “You’re just in hell. It’s like the fire is eating everything around you. Every moment I thought it could not get worse, and it kept getting worse, like a bad dream. I was trying not to run to conserve my oxygen.” She and the small group she was with barely escaped. Although disasters like the Camp Fire seem to strike indiscriminately, in the aggregate that is not quite the case. Cheaper homes built without strong foundations or storm windows tend to be less safe during tornadoes and hurricanes. Floods hit low-lying neighborhoods the hardest, and low-lying neighborhoods are often low-income neighborhoods. In California, the extremely high cost of housing has encouraged building in and migration to certain fire-prone areas. This is to say: The country’s built landscape means that lower-income families are often the most vulnerable to disasters. When a disaster strikes, the evacuation often stratifies on class lines, too. People with very low incomes, the disabled, and the elderly are less likely to have technologies that might alert them of a fire speeding their way or a hurricane about to bear down. In part for this reason, the average age of those who died in the Camp Fire was estimated at 71. [ Read: Trump’s EPA concludes environmental racism is real ] Leaving itself sometimes imposes a significant cost—gas, missed work, hotel rooms—that the wealthier can bear but the poor might not be able to. Hurricane Katrina hit in late August, when many lower-income families were waiting on first-of-the-month checks to pay their bills. Many could not afford to get out. In later surveys, respondents explained that, “The hurricane came at the wrong time, we were waiting for our payday” and that “money was hard to come by.” After the disaster, during the recovery, communities tend to pull together, with the trauma of loss shared across social divisions. That is certainly true in Paradise and the nearby town of Chico, which has absorbed many of the families whose homes burned down. “Everybody knows somebody who was devastated, and everybody is helping,” said Alexa Benson-Valavanis, the chief executive officer of the North Valley Community Foundation. “The despair is so immense, but the other side of that is how people are helping.” Yet the recovery is also when a disaster’s polarizing effect becomes acute: Private and public aid in many cases accrues to the haves more so than the have-nots. “Disasters are increasing the disparity in terms of people’s homes, their income, their access to services,” said Brad Kieserman, the vice president for operations and logistics at the American Red Cross, which remains on the ground after the Camp Fire. “Disasters, for most communities, exacerbate already existing issues, which is why we often see in shelters what what we sometimes refer to as ‘the least, the last, and the lost.’ The people who had the least, who were the last to get services, who were already at the end, who were lost beforehand, especially financially.” Chaos and uncertainty fuels this stratification. The Camp Fire interrupted town services and caused a mass internal displacement, with families crowding into makeshift shelters, setting up tents in church parking lots, doubling up with friends, and occupying any empty hotel rooms, motel rooms, and housing units. For many evacuees, it was unclear who was offering what to whom, or what was guaranteed or even tentatively provided by the government. Making matters worse, the people trying to coordinate resources had often lost their homes or cell phones or computers or cars in the fire. “There was no real clarity on what options were available,” said Tom Tenorio, the executive director of the Community Action Agency of Butte County. A person he works with had become homeless, he said. “She was advised to get a Small Business Administration loan. And she was wondering: ‘Why on earth would I want to get an SBA loan?’” [ Read: For some poor countries, environmental science comes too late ] Income determined who stayed and who left, in part. “People who were able to leave, many of them are gone,” said Audrey Denney, an expert on agriculture and education and recent Congressional candidate now helping with the recovery effort. Research from prior disasters has shown that, as a general point, this is what happens: After a disaster the rich leave and the poor remain. Poverty rates climb by “one percentage point in areas hit by super-severe disasters,” one recent study found. “That suggests that people who aren’t poor are migrating out or that people who are poor are migrating in.” For those staying, life often gets harder, with fewer jobs and increased expenses. For renters and the unstably housed in Paradise and Chico, the fire has given way to a dire housing crisis, with spiked rents, no vacancies, and surging demand. “I’ve lived in the same rental house for years,” said Denney. “My 90-year-old landlord who lives in Sacramento called me yesterday and said, ‘I’m getting the house appraised to sell.’” She said that she might have to try to live with friends, or potentially move away from the area. The poor have been the hardest hit. Two months after the disaster, there are still hundreds living in shelters. “We have people who are trickling down into the ranks of the homeless,” said Laura Cootsona, the executive director of the Jesus Center, a homeless shelter in Chico. “We’re already a relatively low-cost area in California terms, and there’s nowhere for them to go. Most of the surrounding areas also have housing challenges and inadequate housing for the poor.” At a national level, research shows that government aid might widen wealth inequality in the wake of disasters, by helping the well-off more than the poor. “The more FEMA aid a county receives, the more unequal wealth becomes between more and less advantaged residents, holding all else constant, including local hazard damages,” researchers Junia Howell and James Elliott recently found. Disasters also in some ways increase the inequality between communities, not just within them. Richer communities have more philanthropic dollars at the ready, for instance, and stronger tax bases to finance rebuilding. “The community itself—this rural community, this lower-income community, with a lot of retired folks—is going to have to pick up a lot of the slack,” said Benson-Valavanis, talking about Paradise and Chico. “A lot of the need is going to be met by our local nonprofits and philanthropy. That’s a daunting realization when, of course, none of us were prepared for a disaster of this magnitude.” At an international level, the effect is perhaps strongest and clearest. Lower-income countries are more vulnerable to climate-change linked natural disasters, less capable of mitigating the fatal effects of such disasters, and more likely to have their growth paths damaged by such disasters. It need not be so—particularly not in the United States. Legislators could rework federal disaster aid to ensure that more assistance goes to low-income families and communities. They could help make communities more resilient to climate change, which would act as a powerful kind of stimulus, and might make the poor less vulnerable to begin with. And they could exert themselves to reduce income inequality to prevent yet more extreme stratification as climate change takes hold. For now, though, disasters remain a potent force of polarization, sorting the haves from the have-nots.","Two months after the Camp Fire, the recovery in Paradise, California, is harder for some than for others.",2019-01-21T11:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Natural Disasters Worsen Inequality,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/why-natural-disasters-are-worse-poor/580846/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/01/RTS26CCR/facebook.jpg?1547849269,,Theatlantic.com,Natural disasters,1

A staircase to nowhere and some charred I beams are all that’s left of a house that once commanded million-dollar views of California’s Bell Canyon. A burned-out Mercedes sits beside them, waiting to be hauled away. Stapled to the home’s mailbox is a county demolition order that reads unsafe; the front yard is littered with debris.
The house in this affluent neighborhood has looked like this since November, when the Woolsey Fire left it -- along with 100 other homes around the bowl-shaped canyon north of Malibu -- in various states of destruction. Inside the ruins, refrigerator doors tilt open, exposing rotted food. Drawers hang ajar from slouching kitchen cabinets. A couch is visible through one broken window, a candy dish still sitting on the nearby coffee table.
The massive blaze was one of three fires that touched off on the same day and tore through Southern California for weeks, the deadliest and most devastating natural disaster in state history, and the costliest on the planet in 2018. In this tony gated subdivision, the fire was particularly cruel, thanks to the Santa Ana winds. Embers circled the ridge above the valley and picked off houses randomly, while leaving others seemingly untouched.
That was when Kyle Waters’ phone began to ring. And ring. And ring.

“All day long,” he says. “It literally would not stop.”
Waters is a franchisee with the Paul Davis company, part of a fast-expanding industry that cleans up mold and smoke damage from emergencies ranging from mundane water-heater leaks to multibillion-dollar fires, floods, and hurricanes. In Bell Canyon, where he’s checking on his crew this day in January, his team has been scrubbing out the houses that survived, some with scorched exterior walls, others with ash-filled interiors. “Every single home here smelled like smoke,” he says.
These days, natural catastrophes -- “cats,” in industry lingo -- are driving growth in this business. In the United States, the annual number of floods, mudslides, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and other disasters is up from 60 in 1980 to more than 100 in 2017, according to the Insurance Information Institute; the value of the damage inflicted by hurricanes alone has grown from $25 billion a year to $170 billion when adjusted for inflation.
With their vast networks of partners, employees, and shared resources, franchises are particularly well-positioned to respond to these fast-moving natural events. Plus, nationally known brand names give franchise players an advantage over independent contractors who swoop into a disaster area; local franchisees have already earned the trust of their communities. And when the worst happens, customers want someone they trust.
“We’re not hurting for work,” Waters says wryly. Standing on a windswept hill outside a client’s house as it begins to rain, he is careful with his words. There’s money to be made in this industry, but no one loves the idea of profiting from other people’s hardship. He’s also pragmatic about how and when he can help, and knows his services will always be needed: “We’re not going to stop the fires and the hurricanes from coming.”
Recovery efforts require cleanup, repair, and total reconstruction.

Waters, who spent 10 years as an insurance adjuster, first considered breaking into the franchise world at the recommendation of his uncle, a franchise consultant. As he dug into his research, the opportunity in the cleanup space was undeniable.
Along with the rise in “cats,” related insurance claims ballooned to $102 billion in 2017. That’s three times as much as a decade ago, even after being adjusted for inflation. And thanks to climate change -- the U.S. Geological Survey acknowledges that warming temperatures will bring more droughts and fires and powerful storms, while rising sea levels expose ever-larger areas to flooding -- this destructive trend shows no signs of abating.
“If you’re in a private equity firm right now, you could make a case to go invest in the reconstruction sector partly based on the recent intensification of weather,” says Rich Wilson, president of Paul Davis, which has 325 franchisees across North America. He signed one prescient 40-something former Wall Street guy as a franchisee in Houston just before Hurricane Harvey turned that city into one giant, soggy market for water-damage cleanup. Says Wilson: “He did his homework, and he was right.”
That reality is attracting plenty of competition. Amazon is muscling in with its Home &amp; Business Services division, and in 2017 HomeAdvisor spent $500 million on Angie’s List to increase its reach. “Everybody’s nibbling at the edges of this industry,” says Sheldon Yellen, CEO of Belfor Property Restoration, which owns Ductz, Hoodz, and 1-800 Water Damage. 
Related: To Make 1-800-Got-Junk A Success, Its Founder Had To Rethink Everything (Including Himself)
In response, franchises have gone on a consolidation spree, bulking up into one-stop shops big enough to fight back when nature comes calling: Belfor bought Bamcor, which rebuilds and repairs factories after floods or fires; Home Franchise Concepts bought the mold-removal, duct-cleaning, and water-damage company AdvantaClean in January; and Paul Davis is now a subsidiary of FirstService Brands, which also includes CertaPro Painters.
Those consolidation efforts have helped franchises maintain a big chunk of the disaster-­cleanup business. A strong brand name gives credibility in a vocation infamous for fly-by-night storm chasers who take advantage of vulnerable home and business owners. “When we roll into a city, people recognize our name,” says Russell Benes, a Florida-based franchisee with restoration brand PuroClean. “It gives people peace of mind to know that a national company is coming in.” Plus, in the eyes of insurers -- who cover most of the high cost of cleanup from catastrophes -- franchises are easier to deal with.
As a result, franchisors are fielding increased interest from prospective franchisees. Some, like Waters, come from the insurance side. Others are military veterans or former first responders, like Benes, who spent 25 years as a firefighter before becoming one of PuroClean’s 270 franchisees. “Those are the people who love working with us,” says Wilson. “People who want to help.”
They’re also people who see value in joining a system that can navigate red tape, licenses, and permits that can vary state by state, not to mention offer structured training programs. AdvantaClean even has a continuing-­education center with a cleanup-simulation lab on a five-acre campus in Huntersville, N.C.
The franchise model “hockey-sticks your growth,” says Jonathan Porter, a New Orleans–based franchisee with AdvantaClean, which has grown from 83 territories in 2011 to more than 230. “It’s a great balance between the larger corporate players and an independent operator. It gives you a base of knowledge, and it helps you look professional. The likelihood of our getting into [this business] at all without franchising was almost nil.”
And though the bulk of this industry’s work is based on smaller, more frequent jobs like mopping up after broken pipes, franchisees are still coming in droves -- and when disaster does strike, there’s more than enough work to go around.
Waters, the Paul Davis franchisee doing wildfire cleanup in California, estimates that he was able to handle only a quarter of the requests that poured in after the fires hit. “We had to turn away almost everybody, to be honest,” he says, adding that he was unwilling to hire temporary employees who were unskilled in the space. “The important thing is not to overpromise.”
Therein lies another massive advantage franchisees have when a catastrophe strikes a community: a network of other franchisees and a corporate office that can help them all spring to action -- together.
Franchise cleanup crews bring support and hope to devastated residents.

Typically, a franchisee gets one new business lead every day or so. “But when a storm hits, you get 100 or 200 calls every two hours,” says Jeff Stone, a Dallas-based Servpro franchisee who doubles as the company’s state director in Texas and Louisiana. When Hurricane Harvey pounded Houston in 2017, the area’s 17 franchise owners got 17,000 new referrals in the first week and a half. “The local franchise gets inundated,” Stone says. “They don’t know which way is up.”
So when a hurricane is forecast -- or a spell of Arctic cold threatens to freeze pipes, or when wildfires spread toward subdivisions -- Servpro activates one of four regional “storm sites,” located in Alabama, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Texas.
“We’ve really started to dial this thing in,” says Brian Petraitis, disaster recovery manager in Servpro’s commercial large loss division. “When we see a major event [coming], we’re able to activate a site and get crews mobilized. Our franchisees have a finite capacity; we’re here to augment that and provide as many resources as we have.”
At AdvantaClean, when call volume spikes, a central office helps to triage referrals and bring in other franchisees, says Matt Phillips, the company’s president. “Unlike companies that may be based out of one city, we already have a presence in multiple communities,” he says. “So we’re helping that local owner with forward operating support from headquarters, and other franchisees are coming into town to support them with equipment and labor.”

The work is taxing, dirty, and at times, dangerous. After Hurricane Katrina, Stone says he was pulling insulation from the ceiling of a flooded house when a live snake “at least 10 feet long” fell on top of him. He laughs about it now, but he admits that the work is not for the faint of heart. “It takes a lot of wear and tear on people,” Stone says. “They’re working 14-hour days, seven days a week, living in hotels, washing their clothes in the sink at night.”
And the physical toll is nothing compared with the emotional weight of this work. “People are calling us on one of the worst days of their lives,” Phillips says. “They’re standing in a couple feet of water in their kitchen and they’ve lost everything, or they’ve even lost a loved one. We’re a shoulder to cry on.”
Stone remembers sitting in his company pickup truck in a Taco Bell parking lot while responding to flooding in Boulder, Colo., in 2013, trying to catch up on messages from potential customers. “I look out the window, and I must have had 20 people lined up outside my truck [waiting to talk to me],” he says. “They were saying, ‘I haven’t been in my house for days’ or ‘My mother-in-law is dying of cancer, and we can’t get back into our home.’ You get an idea of how this affects people.”
Most franchisees told me they take a few days off to reset following a cleanup job. “There can be a lot of burnout,” Petraitis says. When the next storm hits, they’re ready to mobilize once again, both out of responsibility to their clients and community and because each disaster can translate to months of job security: AdvantaClean experienced an increase of more than $3.5 million in work in the first two weeks after Hurricane Harvey -- and those jobs are still ongoing. “We’re in a highly recession-­resistant business,” Phillips says.
Back in Bell Canyon, Waters’ crew has finished with the still-intact house beside the scorched Mercedes. It took six days for six workers to clean the inside of this 2,200-square-foot home. They used high-efficiency particulate air filter vacuums throughout the entire place. Alkaline solution was used to counteract the acid in the ash. Air purifiers with carbon filters ran for days. “If you leave one square inch [untouched], it’s still going to smell,” says Waters. They’ll come back to power wash the exterior walls when the weather improves. Waters has another crew doing the same thing for a client on the other side of Malibu.
Laura Deneri, whose nearby house was damaged but ultimately spared by the fire, wanders outside into the drizzle to pick up the mail for a neighbor. After the fire, she hired another cleanup company to scour her house in time for her to host Thanksgiving dinner. “We had soot inside, ash, the smell,” she says. “A week in, we found out our roof had been on fire and needed to be patched.”
Deneri looks around her at the piles of rubble on one side of the street and the intact houses on the other. “The hardest part is seeing your house still there,” she says. “It’s survivors’ guilt. Especially when you see your dear, sweet neighbors’ houses.”
She goes inside, and Waters climbs into his pickup truck and drives past a number of other cleanup companies’ vans, still parked along the quiet streets. He’s done here for now, leaving as the rain intensifies and voices from the radio warn of mud-slides in the blackened hills. As if on cue, Waters’ phone rings. An insurance company is calling. “Before you know it,” Waters says, “there’s another disaster coming.”","The increase of hurricanes, floods and fires worldwide has created increased demand and opportunity for brands and franchises in the restoration space.",2019-04-10T13:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",Natural Disasters Are On The Rise.

The project, aimed at bringing AI to commercial drone flyers, is “challenging teams to develop artificial intelligence (AI) technology that will enable an autonomous drone to race a pilot-operated drone – and win.” The racers can win up to $2 million in prizes. Lockheed Martin Chief Technology Officer Keoki Jackson announced the challenge at TechCrunch’s Disrupt event in San Francisco today. “At Lockheed Martin, we are working to pioneer state-of-the-art, AI-enabled technologies that can help solve some of the world’s most complex challenges – from fighting wildfires and saving lives during natural disasters to exploring the farthest reaches of deep space,” said Jackson. “Now, we are inviting the next generation of AI innovators to join us with our AlphaPilot Innovation Challenge. Competitors will have an opportunity to define the future of autonomy and AI and help our world leverage these promising technologies to build a brighter future.” Contestants will use NVIDIA’s Jetson platform to fly drones “without any pre-programming or human intervention” through a multi-dimensional race course. The contestants can win an extra $250,000 for creating an AI that outperforms a DRL human-piloted drone, a sort drone Turing test that could mean smarter drones for both amateur flyers and Lockheed’s own extensive drone programs. Lockheed Martin is working with the Drone Racing League to bring the competitors in human-controlled drone racing into the AI future. The goal is to create a drone that flies as well – or better – than a human.

Rachel Premack,"The vast majority of Americans are unprepared or underprepared for a natural disaster. At least that's what they said in a recent poll from Business Insider partner MSN found. MSN surveyed Americans on their emergency preparedness. It then used machine learning and big data, such as the census, to model how a representative sample of the US would have responded. It's as accurate as a traditional scientific survey, MSN said. According to the poll, only three in ten Americans say they have an emergency preparedness kit, 42% of Americans say they're not at all prepared for a disaster, and 46% say they're only prepared a little. What's perhaps more troubling, some parts of America are even less prepared than this. In 16 states, 25% or fewer residents said they have an emergency preparedness kit. In those same states, almost half of the population said they're not at all prepared for disaster, while more than 40% said they're a little prepared. States prone to disasters tend to be more concerned about disasters. The majority of South Carolinians, for example, say they understand the need to prepare for hurricanes. Unsurprisingly, South Carolina is also one of the most prepared states. But this isn't always the case. Families in Washington, DC — which is considered a high-risk area for natural disasters — are the least likely to have an emergency kit or to report being prepared for a disaster. While flooding, hurricanes, and other disasters are less likely in certain areas, scientists say that climate change will destabilize the weather patterns we've come to expect. A climate change report by scientists from 13 federal agencies concluded that the hurricanes will increase in the Atlantic, Pacific, and eastern North Pacific. A hotter, drier climate is also starting to exacerbate wildfires, like the destructive ones in California last year. The costliest year on record for natural disasters was 2017, with $306 billion spent nationwide to provide aid and relief and recuperate weather-related damage And rising sea levels could flood Facebook's headquarters, Harvard Business School, New Orleans, and other major US cities and institutions.

Lena Requist,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. Disasters can strike businesses at any time and take almost any shape: A flood takes out a startup’s servers. A founder is imprisoned. A tornado destroys the office building. Whether it’s a natural disaster, a PR scandal or something else altogether, not being ready can add another level of devastation to an entrepreneur’s life. I know this firsthand. My company, ONTRAPORT, endured the Santa Barbara fires and aftermath that started in late 2017 and ravaged into this year. We also had shifts on our accounting team that resulted in me trying my hand at accounting (not my forte). Needless to say, 2018 has been a year of unexpected change and destruction -- both of my team’s physical surroundings and our “usual” way of doing things. Alongside our CEO, Landon Ray, I debated: “What do we do as leaders of this company and leaders in our community?” It all boiled down to a question that wasn’t so simple to answer: What kind of emergency preparedness should you have in place so when stuff hits the fan, you’re ready to execute? Stuff hits the fan The fires and mudslide in Santa Barbara were crazy acts of nature that resulted in evacuations as people’s health was put at risk with the toxic air. Twenty-three people died in what’s been called “the worst disaster in Santa Barbara history.” It was a scary and traumatic experience as people were spread out, unsure of the status of people they cared about. Before we knew how bad things were going to get, we still knew that the only way to keep our company up and running was by being proactive. We’d created an emergency plan years ago, so when the fires started, I immediately pulled the plan out at 6 a.m. because I had already lost power at my house and knew we were going to lose power in the office. We weren’t in the evacuation area yet, but we needed a generator before they sold out. We made sure to buy the right masks for everyone after we researched how to stay safe with declining air quality. Unlike most homes in Santa Barbara, our office had air conditioning, so we ordered HEPA filters. And when we realized that wasn’t going to be enough because the air quality had become hazardous, we rented a ranch in Los Osos, two hours away. At that point, we evacuated and couldn’t return to the office. We told people to work where they could -- about half came to the ranch, while the rest went to other areas with their families and loved ones. Related: 5 Steps for Managing Disaster Recovery for Your Business When safe places no longer feel safe. We heard stories from others in the area that their employers wouldn’t pay them because they couldn’t work. I get that this was an emergency, and business owners have to make business decisions. We also had some employees who couldn’t work: Our coffee and meal program employee couldn’t take care of people’s food because they weren’t in the office. In the same vein, our childcare center wasn’t taking care of people’s kids, but we knew that, just like our meal program provider, we had to pay them so they could in turn pay rent. Those are the decisions you have to make as an employer; they go a long way toward building trust with people. Treating people well isn’t just a short-term investment but a long-term one, too. We wanted people to feel really taken care of. And that applied to the employees who could still work as well. We set the ranch up with Wi-Fi, VPN, laptops and docking stations. We tried to close every loophole that could prevent us from offering customer support, prevent our marketing team from implementing campaigns or stop our engineers from fixing bugs or working on the development of new features on schedule. How to prevent a disaster from getting bigger Not every employer can move things around the way we did -- but a lot of entrepreneurs can do better than they’re currently planned for. It’s all about remaining thoughtful in how you handle the disaster facing you, and there are some smart ways to do that. 1. Make your priorities known. The only thing more demoralizing for employees who are going through a situation of disastrous proportions is feeling as if they’re means to an end. Servers, process documents and computers can all be replaced; people can’t be. Make it clear that their safety is the most important thing. We sent daily morning and evening emails or messages through our ONTRApeeps social media community to keep everyone connected and make sure people were safe. Every day, we also sent updates on the fire situation based on the information we were receiving so our team knew we were staying informed on a situation that directly impacted their lives and livelihood. Related: First Things First: The 5 Secrets to Prioritization 2. Plan ahead to stay open. While some businesses are built to be hands-on entities -- say, massage therapy or tutoring services -- most entrepreneurs can make plans to keep working when disaster strikes. We proactively placed our servers for customer work in different locations so customers wouldn’t see disruptions, and we created redundancy with Amazon and Google Web Services. Creating tech stopgaps can save your business. 3. Look at what your state provides. Our state had disaster recovery funds, and employees who didn’t get paid could apply for unemployment during that time. Knowing what state benefits are available can be life-saving for both your business and your employees. Go the extra step to prepare the paperwork for affected employees so they can simply submit it if they’d like to access the benefits. Be informed ahead of time. 4. Always have three people who know how to do a job. Not every entrepreneur has three employees. However, every entrepreneur can ensure processes are documented so anyone can follow them. When we ran into issues on the accounting side, many employees asked if they could help, but because some processes weren’t documented, we couldn’t take them up on their offers. Enforce documentation updates -- if you don’t, you’ll be the one cleaning up the debris. 5. Do what you can to help. Our company did Valentine’s Day candy grams as a fundraiser for affected families, raising several hundred dollars through people buying handmade cards from our HR team. We went together to dig out houses and hosted a bucket brigade of 300 people at our office to show our support. We couldn’t afford to provide housing or write huge checks, but we did what we could. Related: Volunteer to Help Those in Need – and Become a Better Entrepreneur No one is immune from disaster, but everyone can prepare for disasters so their impact is limited. Entrepreneurs have a lot to lose when disaster strikes, and not being ready ensures that the devastation takes on new proportions.

ELISA GABBERT,"The phrase “I do,” in the context of a marriage ceremony, is what linguists call a “performative utterance” — words that don’t simply mean or imply but actually enact a change. There are some words powerful enough that, when a president utters them, we might think they amount to a performative utterance, too: For the chief executive to call something a “disaster” in public, for instance, might suggest that a formal disaster declaration will follow. Except lately. During the Oct. 9, 2016, presidential debate, the candidate Donald Trump said “disaster” 17 times. The 17 things that Trump characterized as disasters were, in order: inner cities, Obamacare, single-payer health care plans, Obamacare, Obamacare, Iraq, taxes, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton again, Libya, Hillary Clinton’s foreign-policy record, Aleppo, Nafta, Nafta, education, Hillary Clinton’s political performance in upstate New York and jobs. Since that night, he has used the word “disaster” on Twitter with slightly less frequency — just 31 times. Last year there was a record-breaking pileup of multibillion-dollar “megadisasters,” including wildfires, tornadoes and flooding, but only three of the president’s tweets referred to such events. “Am leaving now for Florida to see our GREAT first responders and to thank the U.S. Coast Guard, FEMA etc.,” he wrote in one, after Hurricane Irma. “A real disaster, much work to do!” The oddly cheerful tone of this tweet aside, the word “real” was an interesting addition, a seeming acknowledgment of the distance between a true disaster and Trump’s preferred, mostly rhetorical usage, which designates its recipient as a laughable mess, a high-profile embarrassment. Merriam-Webster does offer two contemporary definitions for disaster. One is “a sudden calamitous event bringing great damage, loss, or destruction,” as in “natural disasters.” The other is more hyperbolic, in the Trumpian sense: “a sudden or great misfortune or failure,” as in (the dictionary’s example) “The party was a disaster.” This second flavor leaves plenty of room for subjective evaluation of the failure in question. It puts disaster in the eye of the beholder.",It has little to do with lives lost or damage done — and everything to do with the stories we want to tell about ourselves.,2018-04-10T09:00:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",First Words: What Separates Ordinary Bad News From True ‘Disaster’?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/magazine/what-separates-ordinary-bad-news-from-true-disaster.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/15/magazine/15mag-firstwords/15mag-15firstwords-t_CA0-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1

CHARLES McDERMID,"Mr. Witwer was referring to what many are calling the “new normal,” a term now commonly applied to the state’s drastically worsening fire seasons as a result of cyclical drought, climate change and the ceaseless drive to populate fire-prone areas. Last year was the most destructive fire season in California history: more than $10 billion in damage and 44 dead. The ominous question is what comes next. “There is a new normal in California,” Toni Atkins, the State Senate president pro tem, said by email. “Massive wildland fires are now a part of our life — and one of biggest challenges facing the Legislature and governor this year. These fires are every bit the same kind of disaster as earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters that confront states across the country.” Fear has translated into policy: California will spend as much as $1 billion in the coming year to prevent and prepare for wildfires. Mr. McLean said that through Sunday, Cal Fire had this year responded to 1,200 fires that had burned 8,000 acres. Last year at this time, they’d responded to 1,049 fires that burned 2,200 acres. For some, “new normal” is already passé. Scott McLean, the deputy chief of Cal Fire, drives from Chico to Sacramento every day. He’s already watched fire conditions change this year, the grass turning from green to brown.","Wednesday: A battle for second place in the governor’s race, a death in Yosemite and Golden State comes up short.",2018-05-23T13:02:40Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: Experts on Fire Season 2018: Dealing With the ‘New Normal’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/us/california-today-fire-season-2018.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/world/12CALtoday-1/12CALtoday-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1

Cressida Leyshon,"This week’s story, “ Under the Wave,” opens in the middle of the night, as water floods into a house. A family of three was vacationing there—a mother, father, and their son. Only the mother survives. When did you first start thinking of this scenario? I was transfixed by the tsunami in Japan in 2011, and have spent far too much time late at night watching videos of the horror of the rising waters. I know it’s not rational, but I have had a hard time relaxing near beaches since then. In 2013, as soon as “ Wave,” Sonali Deraniyagala’s brilliant and painful memoir of the 2004 tsunami in Sri Lanka came out, I read it, and it lived in the back of my mind until I read last year’s absolutely stunning “ Ghosts of the Tsunami,” by Richard Lloyd Parry, about the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Together, these narratives put pressure on my near-constant thoughts of the refugees now trying to find a place of security and peace throughout the world, and how we owe an absolute moral debt to the most vulnerable among us. The wave is mentioned only once in the story—“The child soon learned that the woman would not look more than once at a drawing with water in it or at anything that hinted of a life lived before the wave”—and the word “tsunami” is never used. Why did you want to hold back on this kind of detail? There wasn’t a conscious decision to hold back; I just didn’t think the character would immediately understand what was happening in all the rush and confusion. Calling it a tsunami felt too analytical until she was a little distant from the emergency, when she could piece together what happened. The woman crosses paths with a young girl at a shelter, and the two leave together. Gradually, the girl starts to take the place of the woman’s son, denying her original identity to someone who recognizes her. Did you know from the outset that the relationship between the woman and the child would play out as it does ? I saw from the outset the allegiance of the child to the woman when faced with someone from the child’s pre-wave past—I knew there was heat and ice cream in the scene. But the rest of it came gradually. Do you think we should see the woman’s desire to look after this child as something that springs from altruism or from selfishness? Is altruism ever completely devoid of selfishness? Shouldn’t we be working for a world without poverty or hunger, providing all humans with excellent, free education and medical care, because it would bring all of us—our very own families and loved ones—far greater security and happiness? If we are surrounded by masses of secure, fed, well-educated people who don’t fear dying by gun violence or because they can’t afford an E.R. visit, our own quality of life and general happiness would skyrocket. You live in Florida, a state that’s no stranger to natural emergencies. You don’t give any place names in the piece, but were you thinking of Florida when you were writing this? There’s a very specific rental house near a beach in Florida that I put the woman and her little family into, and a very specific apartment in a northern city where she goes to live with the child in the aftermath. I have a hard time writing scenes unless I fully envision them. You just published a collection of stories called “ Florida.” Does “Under the Wave” feel like a continuation of the themes you explore in the collection? When I’m working, I never think of my work in thematic terms, which is the terminology of literary analysis, not of creation: it’s a retrospective stance, not an active one. I can hardly see my own work at all, honestly. I write what feels urgent to me, and only in editing does my analytical brain kicks in, but even after a piece has been published I can still only see my own private vision of the piece. And it’s impossible for me to talk about my work as a whole, unless I’m parroting something someone else has told me about it. My face is pressed up against the rug, and from there I can see individual fibres, but readers are the ones who can see the over-all pattern. So I guess it’s a continuation of themes, sure, because it comes from me, but you’d be far better suited to tell me about it than I could ever be. You’ve been travelling around the country on a book tour—does your view of Florida ever change the farther you are from it? Do you find yourself thinking of different kinds of natural calamities ? There is no place that isn’t vulnerable to calamity, particularly in the Anthropocene. The anxious brain finds the built-in flaws everywhere I go—earthquakes and mudslides and desertification galore. The truth is, where my children are at every moment feels like the most vulnerable place of all, particularly if I’m not there. And my vision of Florida is just that—my own idiosyncratic vision probably unshared by anyone else who knows the place—and it doesn’t change with distance.","Cressida Leyshon talks to Lauren Groff about “Under the Wave,” her short story from the July 9 & 16, 2018, issue of The New Yorker.",2018-07-02T09:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Newyorker.com'}",Lauren Groff on Florida and Natural Disasters,https://www.newyorker.com/books/this-week-in-fiction/fiction-this-week-lauren-groff-2018-07-09,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b33dfc59cdd030aa71dde9f/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/Groff-Fiction-QA.jpg",,Newyorker.com,Natural disasters,1
Prashanth Gangu,"Jose A. Bernat Bacete/Getty Images The risks posed by intelligent devices will soon surpass the magnitude of those associated with natural disasters. Tens of billions of connected sensors are being embedded in everything ranging from industrial robots and safety systems to self-driving cars and refrigerators. At the same time, the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are evolving rapidly. Our growing reliance on so many intelligent, connected devices is opening up the possibility of global-scale shutdowns. The good news is that natural disasters themselves, which Munich Re says caused $330 billion in economic losses globally in 2017, provide a template for how to mitigate the growing and catastrophic risk posed by AI. Like they have for extreme weather and natural disasters, companies can begin to establish international protocols and standards to govern AI not just within their own walls, but also to put in place processes to work with other companies, insurers, and policymakers. Intelligent Device Recovery Plans Today, many companies are exposed to intelligent device risks that could harm both their own operations as well as their customers. Yet few have formally quantified the size of their revenue at risk and potential liability. Nor have they set up safety and security protocols for potential Black Swan AI events. Insight Center The Risks and Rewards of AI Sponsored by SAS Assessing the opportunities and the potential pitfalls. They should. Like the risks associated with natural disasters, companies cannot completely protect against smart-device risks by buying insurance; they must have worst-case scenario recovery plans. Managers have to figure out their higher and lower risk intelligent device vulnerabilities, add in redundant systems, and potentially set up the AI equivalent of tsunami early-warning systems. In addition, they need the ability to switch to manually controlled environments in case artificially intelligent systems have to be shut down and to recall faulty smart products. Contingency plans must go beyond a natural disaster playbook. Given the many potential points of connectivity, it will be much more difficult to predict, identify, and correct the cause of large-scale smart-device failures. De-bugging and re-programming a faulty intelligent device is even more complicated than creating a patch to fight against a malevolent cyberattack because it can be unclear what rules the machines are following. As a result, no company will be able to recover on its own. To rebound from the potential impact of a cascading set of global AI-related shocks, managers will have to consider the vulnerabilities that exist everywhere from their suppliers to their customers. Addressing those vulnerabilities will require coordination across a large number of technology service providers and other companies that could catch or spread an AI infection to others, regardless of who is at fault. AI Insurance Products and Services Insurers should quantify their exposure to a global intelligent device meltdown, offer new products, and advise companies and governments. Even with about $700 billion in capital available in the United States and hundreds of billions of dollars more around the globe, property and casualty insurers’ balance sheets are too small to cover all the potential losses from a global intelligent device disaster. But insurers can use data collected on losses across industries to advise companies and governments on how best to quantify their potential exposure to a worst-case scenario. As they have for natural catastrophes, insurers can also encourage public sector safeguards. Since insurers cannot completely mitigate the outsized risks posed by extreme weather events, governments of many developed countries and international organizations provide natural catastrophe relief through government agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and public flood insurance programs. Insurers need to help mobilize similar public sector resources to help the potential victims of an AI-enabled smart device disaster. In addition, they can start to advise clients on how they can enhance their safety and security protocols to head off the dangerous repercussions of an intelligent device meltdown. Today, some leading insurers are suggesting security procedures that companies could follow to attend to information breaches and interruptions in the event of a global failure of interconnected systems. But they should also begin to explore steps to deal with when smart devices become even more sophisticated and potentially set and follow their own objectives. AI International Protocols Finally, policymakers should establish international trust and ethics guidelines to govern the development and implementation of ever more advanced AI products and systems. To reduce the future impact from natural disasters, governments and international organizations like the Red Cross and the World Bank collect and share data concerning the destructive ramifications and the support required to help victims. Similar intelligence will be critical to curb the impact of potential smart device shocks as artificial intelligence evolves and the number of connected IoT (Internet of Things) devices, sensors and actuators reaches over 46 billion in 2021, according to Juniper Research. About a dozen governments, technology companies and international organizations such as the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the World Economic Forum are starting to explore global AI trust and ethics protocols for retaining control of interconnected AI-driven systems and products. These forums are beginning to deepen understanding of the potential harm that intelligent devices could cause and the need for best practices. But much more has to be done. Establishing the resources required to reduce the risks that will come with the world’s transition to more intelligent and interconnected networks will be difficult and costly. But we can’t afford not to do it and our experience responding to some of the world’s worst “100-year storms” offer a valuable starting point for figuring out how to get ahead of potentially even more severe disasters. We just need companies, insurers, and policymakers to recognize that such efforts are an essential investment in our future.","Companies, insurers, and policy makers all play a role.",2018-02-07T14:00:52Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hbr.org'}",We Need to Approach AI Risks Like We Do Natural Disasters,https://hbr.org/2018/02/we-need-to-approach-ai-risks-like-we-do-natural-disasters,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-07-858263346-Jose-A.-Bernat-Bacete.jpg,,Hbr.org,Natural disasters,1
Sandro Galea,"afp/Getty Images Nearly one year after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the official death toll for the disaster stands at 64. However, a new study, published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, estimates that at least 4,645 people have died as a consequence of the storm. That is more than 70 times the official estimate. Perhaps most worrisome, it is not at all clear that we are taking steps to mitigate the consequences of future hurricanes. This observation, as a new hurricane season is about to begin, should give us all pause. With this in mind, what lessons can we learn from Hurricane Maria to better prepare us for future disasters? Here are three. 1. Communities should be ready to handle the full range of health consequences of these disasters. While the new data on the deaths due to Hurricane Maria are sobering, the health effects of disasters such as the hurricane undoubtedly extend well beyond these deaths. They include worsened mental health, lack of access to essential care, and a general deterioration in the health of vulnerable populations. The physical and mental health consequences of disasters are lasting, shaping health for weeks, months, even years after the trauma of the event. When Hurricane Harvey struck Texas and Louisiana, for example, affected populations had to contend with the lacerations, broken bones, flood risk, and sudden death they faced not only on the day of the storm but also in the weeks and months that followed, with mold in their homes, contaminated flood waters, and disruptions in medical care due to flooded hospitals and waterlogged medications. This accumulated hazard continued to undermine health long after the storm had passed. Reviews of the mental health consequences of disasters have found that as many as half of those directly in the path of a hurricane risk developing post-traumatic stress disorder, and 10% of those who live in the general area of the storm run a similar risk. Disasters can also fuel depression and substance use disorders. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, for example, rates of alcohol, cigarette, and drug use increased in New York City. Assessments of those affected by storms should look not only at deaths but entire populations exposed to storms and their aftermath. Health systems need to be prepared to deal with the full range of consequences of these events. 2. Efforts to shore up basic infrastructure must happen well before hurricanes hit. The primary reason for the heavy damage to Puerto Rico was that the stability — or lack — of basic infrastructure in Puerto Rico made the island less able to endure the high-force winds, heavy rains, and physical damage from the storm. Puerto Rico has shown us the fragility of power systems, water systems, and roadways. On September 26, six days after Hurricane Maria made landfall, 58 of Puerto Rico’s 69 hospitals had neither power nor fuel. Weeks later, the situation did not improve. Households went an average of 84 days without electricity, 68 days without water, and 41 days without cellular service. Citizens lacked access not only to health care but also to basic resources. Low-lying coastal regions, like Puerto Rico, are particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters. There is simply no substitute for shoring up basic infrastructure and creating disaster plans to bring damaged systems back online ahead of a hurricane to allow these areas to withstand high-force winds and to mitigate loss of life after hurricanes hit. 3. We must invest in human capital well in advance of disasters. The social, economic, and environmental conditions that shape health before disaster strikes are core to deciding how much damage the event is able to inflict, and how quickly communities can recover. While our narratives of recovery often focus on individual resilience, it is the strength of a society as a whole that most determines its capacity to bounce back after the worst happens. We saw this in Puerto Rico, where generations of economic and political marginalization, combined with a shoddy physical infrastructure, set the stage for the misery that continues to unfold. These issues were known about for years. Had they been properly handled, Puerto Rico might have been far more resilient in the face of Maria. Unfortunately, what happened after Hurricane Maria was eminently predictable. We had decades to invest in the island, to fix its roads and power grid, and to reject the economic colonialism that has done so much to undermine Puerto Rico’s fiscal health. In the age of climate change, with extreme weather events becoming more powerful and frequent, we can ill afford to ignore areas that are likely to suffer the devastating consequences of natural disasters. That we will have more Marias is certain, and how we can prepare for them should be clear if we are paying attention.",We aren’t taking enough steps to prepare for future disasters.,2018-05-30T20:02:46Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hbr.org'}",3 Lessons from Puerto Rico: Mitigating the Health Effects of Future Hurricanes,https://hbr.org/2018/05/3-lessons-from-puerto-rico-mitigating-the-health-effects-of-future-hurricanes,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/05/may18-30-850860206-afp.jpg,,Hbr.org,Natural disasters,1

Claire Zulkey,"This story appears in the January 2018 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe » Sonic ’s signature drive-in model seemed to be a liability in 2017, when Hurricane Harvey damaged or closed many of its 950-plus restaurants in Texas and pushed same-store sales down 3.3 percent in the final fiscal quarter. But the company was more than prepared to handle the challenge. “One of the beautiful things about our system is that we have a disaster-­relief fund that our franchises contribute to,” says senior VP of franchise relations Eddie Saroch. “So the recovery effort is faster and better than most. The fact that we work together as a team to get stores back up and running means that the business regains momentum fast.” Related: Steps to Getting Your Company Ready for a Natural Disaster Sonic’s sales prove that out: Despite the natural disasters, its per-share net income increased for the entire fiscal year from $1.29 in 2016 to $1.45 in 2017. And Saroch’s 2018 forecast calls for more optimism. The chain recently cracked its all-time high of more than 3,200 franchises, and is planning big growth around Washington, D.C.; New York; the Ohio River Valley; Alabama; Virginia; and Washington state. (Sonic intends to focus on domestic growth before going global.) To win new consumers, Sonic is sticking to what works. It continues to use its distinctive “two guys” ad campaign, which features two improv comedians in a car yammering about fast food. And the brand’s message is summarized by a handy acronym: BLADE, meaning the best time to eat at Sonic is breakfast, lunch, afternoon, dinner and evening. (In other words, any time.) Sonic is enhancing its time-tested strategy, though. It recently appointed new marketing leadership to increase media reach and work on technological enhancements like a mobile pay app and a preorder feature to speed up service. Related: Is Your Business Ready for the Next Devastating Natural Disaster? But above all else, Saroch says, Sonic’s strength is its partners -- particularly longtime franchisees who embrace innovation, balanced by old-fashioned experience. The winner of its 2017 outstanding franchisee award typifies this, he says. It was a second-generation Sonic owner who started working as a cook for his father in 1969, when he was 14 years old. “Building a family business, staying in the brand for a long time,” Saroch says, is what Sonic is all about.

Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced another major departure from its senior ranks on Tuesday, with the resignation of Thomas P. Bossert as President Trump’s chief adviser on homeland security. Mr. Bossert’s resignation coincided with the arrival of John R. Bolton as the president’s national security adviser, and was an unmistakable sign that Mr. Bolton is intent on naming his own people. In a statement, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the president thanked Mr. Bossert, 43, for “for his patriotic service and wishes him well.” “The president is grateful for Tom’s commitment to the safety and security of our great country,” Ms. Sanders said. “Tom led the White House’s efforts to protect the homeland from terrorist threats, strengthen our cyber defenses, and respond to an unprecedented series of natural disasters.” Mr. Bossert, who served in the George W. Bush administration, made a name for himself in the current White House as the public face of the administration’s response to hurricanes that tore through Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. But administration officials said he chafed at that part of his job, preferring to get involved in policy issues on counterterrorism and cyberwarfare.

Peter Kotecki,"David J. Phillip/AP From rainfall to wildfires, 2017 was a record-breaking year for natural disasters. In August and September, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria left behind a high death toll, drowned homes, and destroyed power lines. Hundreds of people died in earthquakes around the world, from Mexico to the Iran-Iraq border, and nearly 1,400 people were killed during monsoon rains in South Asia. Fires devastated locations around the world, perhaps most notably in California, where the government spends over 10 times as much money on fighting wildfires as it did 20 years ago.

Associated Press,"(SAN FRANCISCO) — A judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from ending protections that let immigrants from four countries live and work legally in the United States, saying the move would cause “irreparable harm and great hardship.” U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco granted a request for a preliminary injunction against the administration’s decision to discontinue temporary protected status for people from Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti and El Salvador. The status is granted to countries ravaged by natural disasters or war and lets citizens of those countries remain in the U.S. until the situation improves back home. About 300,000 people have received those protections. The ruling said the government failed to show the harm of continuing the 20-year-old program and the plaintiffs established that uprooting those immigrants could hurt the local and national economy. “Beneficiaries who have lived, worked, and raised families in the United States (many for more than a decade), will be subject to removal,” Chen wrote. Many have children who were born in the U.S. and may be faced with the choice of “bringing their children with them (and tearing them away from the only country and community they have known) or splitting their families apart,” the ruling said. Homeland Security officials said they could not comment on ongoing litigation. A lawsuit alleges the administration’s decision was motivated by racism and cites Trump’s vulgar reference to African countries during a meeting about immigration at the White House in January. Chen questioned the administration’s motives at a hearing last month. He cited a memo that he said suggested the decision was driven by the administration’s America First policy. He asked an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department to respond to plaintiffs’ allegations that America First meant excluding immigrants who are not white. Adam Kirschner, a government attorney, said the memo showed then-Homeland Security Acting Secretary Elaine Duke grappling with what to do about temporary protected status. Kirschner said input from the White House was expected on an issue like this, but the final decision was Duke’s. Chen repeated Trump’s vulgar comment about African countries while responding that any influence the White House had on Duke could be relevant to the claims that the administration’s moves were discriminatory. El Salvador was designated for the program in 2001 after an earthquake, and the country’s status was repeatedly renewed. The Trump administration announced in January that the program would expire for El Salvador in September 2019. The administration concluded that El Salvador had received significant international aid to recover from the earthquake, and homes, schools and hospitals there had been rebuilt. The Trump administration ended the program for the other three countries as well. More than 200,000 immigrants could face deportation because of the change, and they have more than 200,000 American children who risk being uprooted from their communities and schools, according to plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",A judge blocked the Trump administration from ending protections for immigrants from four countries ravaged by natural disasters or war,2018-10-04T01:43:34Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",A Judge Blocked the Trump Administration From Ending Protections for Some Immigrants,http://time.com/5414861/judge-trump-immigration-temporary-protected-status/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/gettyimages-1035799868.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Natural disasters,1
SYDNEY EMBER,"Photo After decades of corporate control, The Los Angeles Times will once again come under local ownership. Credit Mario Anzuoni/Reuters The Los Angeles Times, one of the country’s most prominent newspapers whose reporting has exposed municipal corruption, felled local figures and chronicled California’s relentless natural disasters, is being sold to Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire Los Angeles doctor, for $500 million. Tronc, the newspaper’s parent company, announced the agreement, which includes the paper’s sister publication, The San Diego Union-Tribune, on Wednesday morning. The deal includes the assumption of $90 million in pension liabilities. It is expected to be completed within three months. With the sale, The Times would once again come under local ownership, ending nearly two decades of corporate control. It would also represent a significant retreat for Tronc, which entertained national and international ambitions after Michael W. Ferro Jr. became the company’s chairman and biggest shareholder two years ago. Its decision to sell The Times, its crown jewel, comes after months of turmoil and management turnover at the paper, during which journalists increasingly clashed with Tronc executives and the leaders they had sent to run the paper’s newsroom. “We are pleased to transition leadership of The Los Angeles Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune to local ownership,” Justin Dearborn, the Tronc chief executive, said in a statement. “We are certain that the journalistic excellence in Southern California will continue long into the future.” Continue reading the main story","The $500 million deal means the newspaper will once again come under local ownership, ending nearly two decades of corporate control.",2018-02-07T14:00:42Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Tronc Agrees to Sell Los Angeles Times to Billionaire Doctor,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/business/media/los-angeles-times-sale.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/08/business/08latimes/08latimes-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1
JAMES ESTRIN,"Haiti, beset by natural disasters, a lack of infrastructure and poor sanitation, has had a more difficult path. When Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti, Ms. Bruce covered it as spot news for the National Geographic’s website, including documenting its effect on sanitation and the availability of indoor toilets for her project. She also photographed the people she sees as the “unsung heroes of sanitation in Haiti,” the “bayakou” who often strip down and climb into pit latrines to clean them out.

MEKELA PANDITHARATNE,"The wind and rain began lashing New Orleans in the early hours of Aug. 29, 2005, while President George W. Bush was on vacation at his ranch in Texas. As the levees buckled and water poured into the city, the federal government tarried. Later, Hurricane Katrina’s long pall — the more than 1,800 related deaths, the devastation and the slow federal response — would come to haunt Mr. Bush’s presidency, cratering his approval rating. President Trump, who has overseen his own hurricane crisis after last year’s storms in Texas and Puerto Rico, has largely escaped the presidency-defining censure that dogged Mr. Bush after Hurricane Katrina. Last week,Puerto Rico’s government increased the island’s official death toll, estimating that 2,975 people died as a result of the hurricane and its effects — up from the tally of just 64 that had been the official count until then. Nearly one year after the storm hit, we now know that Hurricane Maria may be among the deadliest natural disasters to occur in the United States in a century. So why the pass for President Trump? Mr. Trump’s scandal-plagued presidency has benefited from a deliberate pattern of diversion and the deep executive dysfunction he has created in the federal government. Under his tenure, the president has given the impression it is not the White House’s job to coordinate with federal agencies and that by extension, he does not own his agencies’ failures.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","For the first time in more than eight years, members of the House Committee on Natural Resources came together to formally discuss the impacts of climate change on Wednesday.
Though the House Committee on Natural Resources was clearly divided down party lines on topics like energy production, most members could agree on the need to better prepare their communities to handle extreme weather events and natural disasters. The representatives mentioned hurricane after hurricane, wildfire after wildfire, all to note the increasing urgency of climate change. And, more importantly, the impact its having on people already.
Panelists included Governors Roy Cooper and Charlie Baker, of North Carolina and Massachusetts, respectively, as well as non-government officials like Elizabeth Yeampierre, the executive director of Brooklyn-based climate justice group UPROSE, and Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr., the president of civil rights group Hip Hop Caucus. A couple odd climate skeptics and industry sweethearts sat alongside them at the invitation of Republican members.
Most witnesses were clear thatclimate change isnt something for leadersto waste time debating anymore, but a problem that requires immediate actionespecially to protect the low-income communities and communities of color hardest hit. Congress didnt ask 16-year-old Nadia Nazar, who co-founded Zero Hour Movement, a youth-led organization raising the alarm on climate change through protest and activism, any direct questions, but she perhaps said it the best during her testimony.
Humanity has pushed this planet to the edge, and from my view, it seems that few in the policy and political world are paying attention to the consequences of our actions over the generations, said Nazar during her testimony, her only opportunity to speak.
Now that morefolks in Congress are finally paying attention, one might expect policy solutions to come up, but nothing concrete was recommended during this first meeting.
There was, however, ample criticism to the not-yet-proposed Green New Deal. The idea, which is supposed to help transition the U.S. to a green energy economy with equity in mind, is still nascent, but the Republican committee members used this first meeting as an opportunity to attempt to delegitimize potential policy proposals, which Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Senator Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts) are set to unveil in the near future. A draft version of the proposal, which Bloomberg has obtained, reportedly includes mention of achieving 100 percent clean powerbut doesnt explicitly call for a ban on fossil fuels.
When Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Arizona) asked who would be most negatively impacted by a Green New Deal, Derrick Hollie of Reaching America, which focuses on energy poverty among black communities, responded with, Minorities because we cant afford rising costs associated with policies.
(Its worth noting that Hollie supports fossil fuel development and has collaborated with the American Petroleum Institute through Explore Offshore, an offshore drilling coalition by the institute.)
Other speakers, like Yeampierre and Yearwood, made clear they believe radical change like a Green New Deal is necessary if we are going to keep the impacts of climate change at bay. These witnesses emphasized that the specific policies will look different for different places. Every states energy portfolio varies, and every communitys need varies.
The needs are different everywhere in the country, Yeampierre of UPROSE said following a question by Rep. Donald McEachin (D-Virginia) on ensuring such a transition toward clean energy is done properly. [The solution] isnt cookie cutter, but it is a commitment.
Yeampierre was arguably the most outspoken during the discussions. She broke protocol time after time to ensure that her voice, as one of the two women of color on the panel (including Nazar, who was barely acknowledged), was being heard. Shed speak out of term, unapologetically.
We cant talk about these ecosystems devoid of talking about the impact on human rights and on the people affected, she said, after a question was posed to climate scientist Kim Cobb related to climate changes impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. More than 5,000 Puerto Ricans died. That is not nothing. That is not just an ecosystem. That was an entire island that was affected.
This was one of two hearings on climate change Wednesday; the other held by the House Committee on Energy on Commerce was the first in six years. This new beginning of climate change acceptance and discussion is a refreshing change from the days of the GOP-controlled House. The climate change meetings back then were not based on science or factbut on lies and denial.
At least thats mostly changed. Lets see how the rest of these meetings go.","For the first time in more than eight years, members of the House Committee on Natural Resources came together to formally discuss the impacts of climate change on Wednesday.

BRIAN TALLERICO,"For the past three decades, there has been one constant in Americas comedy landscape: The Simpsons. With that animated sitcom now approaching the start of its 30th season, on Sept. 30, its a good time to reflect on how The Simpsons has evolved during its unparalleled run, and how each era in that evolution has reflected or failed to reflect the state of comedy, and of the culture, as a whole. Neither The Simpsons nor history has stood still since the show debuted in 1989. The first family of Springfield has witnessed five American presidents, the dawn of the internet age, the end of the Cold War, at least two prolonged conflicts in the Middle East, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and more. And while Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie have stayed the same age, what the world finds funny has changed in no small part because of those characters influence. Almost thirty years after its premiere, The Simpsons still matters. Below, weve broken down the history of The Simpsons into six distinct eras, based on the ways its humor has changed over the years.

Cory Doctorow,"Until 2017, the biggest bill Americans ever paid for a year's worth of ""natural disasters"" was $214.8B, back in 2005: in 2017, it was at least $300B, not counting much of the damage to Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria. Those Chinese hoaxes are fantastically detailed. Every now and again, you hear people talk about how unrealistically expensive it will be to decarbonize our industry and energy sectors. Those people (who often complain about paying for social programs because ""we are saddling our children with debt"") are fucking idiots and they owe the rest of us at least $300,000,000 for 2017. The estimates include insured and uninsured losses, and the data used were compiled from several sources, such as the Insurance Services Office, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Interagency Fire Center, Energy Information Administration, U.S. Army Corps and various state agencies. In calculating its records, NOAA compares years since 1980, when the agency began looking at the costs of disasters. Data on some disasters could also still be forthcoming, especially on the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, said Adam Smith, an economist at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. This is not that unusual. Data from damage due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was still pouring in several months after the storm.

Lucas Matney,"Indiana Jones’ exclamation of, “It belongs in a museum!” is taking a trip into the digital age with a Google initiative that will save archaeological sites to the cloud. Google’s non-profit Arts and Culture arm is partnering with another non-profit, Oakland-based CyArk, which flies drones and sets up cameras around historical sites using photogrammetry and LiDAR scanning tech to create dense models composed of thousands of photos and data points. These scans had previously not been available publicly but with the help of Google, CyArk now has opened access to a number of their scans and will be adding more. CyArk’s mission has largely been focused on preservation of these sites. In a talk I attended earlier today, the non-profit detailed that as these historic structures they scan are threatened by natural disasters or human conflict, the data they have offers the potential for these sites to be restored with laser accuracy or at least preserved as they were for future generations to enjoy in a digital sense. Google’s Art and Culture team has already done a lot of intensely cool work when it comes to preserving artwork across the globe in high-resolution glory. With the advent of so many methods for capturing large-scale 3D models over the past few years, it makes sense that Google would eye preservation of physical structures next. The fact that this 3D digitization arrives in the early stages of consumer VR also gives it a quality platform to be viewed on which will only get better. As opposed to 360 photos, viewers will actually be able to walk around these sites, look into crevices and peek behind objects captured spatially. It’s actually pretty exciting and the ability to preserve culture as scaled physical locations that you could physically walk through in the future is a deeply intimate view of history that modern technology has converged on. That Google is working with non-profits is largely positive to carry this out is admirable and one can hope that they direct more resources to aid these efforts on a global scale so that more people can experience immersive history. Today, you can check out 25 of these historic sites in 18 countries. You can view the models and environments in desktop mode as well as on PC and mobile VR headsets.","Indiana Jones’ exclamation of, “It belongs in a museum!” is taking a trip into the digital age with a Google initiative that will save archaeological sites to the cloud.

Brian Heater,"CyPhy Works announced this morning that it is shifting focus and rebranding as Aria Insights. The new company is focused on utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning to help analyze data collected by drones. Aria will build upon CyPhys tethered drone data collection, to help pull information in dangerous situations from oil tankers and pipelines to natural disasters.
The new platform is designed to detect relevant information, alert the user and collect it on a 3D map, while keeping humans out of harms way. As it notes in a press release tied to the announcement, the Aria takes its name from flocks of canaries used to keep coal miners safe. 
A number of our partners were collecting and housing massive amounts of information with our drones, but there was no service in the industry to quickly and efficiently turn that data into actionable insights, Lance Vanden Brook, former CyPhy and current Aria CEO said in a statement. “Moving beyond just a hardware provider, Aria is now a full-service solution that not only meets customers aerial needs, but also processes analytics that enable insightful decision making.
CyPhy was founded in 2008 by iRobot co-founder Helen Greiner. After serving as CEO, then CTO, Greiner left the company last year, as it raised a $4.5 million Series D. That brought the drone companys total funding up to $39 million, by Crunchbases estimation. At the time, it was noted that the founder had left work at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology.

Catie Keck,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency may have put the personally identifying information of millions of disaster survivors at risk of fraud and identity theft, according to a recent report from the Department of Homeland Securitys Office of Inspector General.
The March 15 report said that during an audit of FEMAs Transitional Sheltering Assistance program, it found that the agency shared and subsequently exposed the personal data of 2.3 million survivors of a number of natural disasters that included the 2017 California wildfires as well as hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.
Survivors of these incidents provided their private information to FEMA in order to obtain assistance such as temporary housing. The audit found that FEMA jeopardized private information that the agency collected about applicants when it unnecessarily released some of that information to an undisclosed contractor handling its TSA program.
FEMA, the report stated, shared with the contractor more than 20 unnecessary data fields for survivors participating in the TSA program, including bank names, account numbers, and home addresses.
FEMA Press Secretary Lizzie Litzow told Gizmodo in a statement by email on Friday that since becoming aware of the issue, the agency has has taken aggressive measures to correct this error, including by conducting its own audit of the contractors information system. Litzow also said FEMA is no longer sharing what the OIG identified as unnecessary information with the contractor.
To date, FEMA has found no indicators to suggest survivor data has been compromised, Litzow said. FEMA has also worked with the contractor to remove the unnecessary data from the system and updated its contract to ensure compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cybersecurity and information-sharing standards. As an added measure, FEMA instructed contracted staff to complete additional DHS privacy training.
A DHS official who spoke with the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity said that it did not have information that any data had been compromised. He did, however, tell the Post that the banking information of 1.8 million individuals had been exposed in the breach, with roughly three-quarters of a million addresses also exposed.
The agency said Friday its goal remains protecting and strengthening the integrity, effectiveness, and security of our disaster programs that help people before, during, and after disasters.

Lauren DeLisa Coleman,"Devastating floods in Houston, raging fires in California. It seems like the number of natural disasters is increasing in our country. Of course, preventing loss of life is job number one. However, you, your loved ones, and employees are safe, many entrepreneurs are faced with the very challenging task of dealing with property damage to one's office space or, in cases of larger businesses, the entire office building. How can you be best prepared to navigate the system? In fact, according to a recent report, real estate that is at fire risk in Southern California alone is valued at $5 billion. This area of the country is under high-watch given the massive fires that are spreading across areas, but no matter where you may be based, it's important now more than ever to be informed and prepared so that your office property and assets can be protected. Real estate investor, advisor, author, Andy Dane Carter has a variety of insight into this area. He suggests doing these three main things: 1. Ensure Replacement Cost or Actual Cash Value. It is important to ensure any properties for at least 80 percent of its replacement value. ""Actual cash value is the amount it would take to repair or replace damage to your property after depreciation. For example, I had a development project burn down in Los Angeles county. The insurance company wanted to only pay us the minimum but because we had an additional policy we were able to rebuild more quickly,"" Carter told me.. 2. Read Your Policy Carefully Naturally, a property insurance policy is a legal contract. It is written so that your rights and responsibilities, as well as those of the insurance company, are clearly stated. ""I can't stress this enough! If you don't understand what is written, ask questions make sure you have an attorney review it so that you are well-protected in the future,"" Carter adds. 3. Review Your Home Insurance Needs Every Year. Of course, many entrepreneurs have home offices, both large and small. So Carter suggests checking with your insurance agent at least once a year to make sure your policy provides adequate coverage. Carter adds, ""The addition of a room, new insulation or remodeling add value to your property and, therefore, may increase replacement cost. Many people forget to do this, and it's very very important."" It's important to take care of your assets as you work to build a legacy for your family. Make sure that you are well-armed with the right information and expertise.",Several tips for entrepreneurs on how to protect their office buildings during what is a rising trend of natural disasters.,2017-12-12T13:17:08Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",How to Protect Your Business in the Face of a Natural Disaster,https://www.inc.com/lauren-delisa-coleman/how-to-protect-your-business-in-face-of-a-natural-disaster.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_537795378_335488.jpg,,Inc.com,Natural disasters,1
Rayne Ellis,"Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria one year ago next month. Since the island's long recovery began, the government and independent institutions have worked to figure out exactly how many lives were taken by the effects of the extreme storm. SEE ALSO: We may never see a hurricane season worse than the one that brought us Katrina Today, we have a new, better estimate — and it’s more than 46 times the old one. According to a new study released by George Washington University (GW), 2,975 people died as a result of the hurricane. The government of Puerto Rico now accepts that number as an accurate death toll, updating their previous official estimate of 64. A group of workers repair a gravestone damaged by Hurricane Maria in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images The GW group teamed up with the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health to analyze death certificates and other mortality data collected from September 2017 to February 2018. They found that the number of deaths during that time were uncharacteristically high, when compared to that same time period from other years. “The results of our epidemiological study suggest that, tragically, Hurricane Maria led to a large number of excess deaths throughout the island. Certain groups – those in lower income areas and the elderly – faced the highest risk,” lead investigator Carlos Santos-Burgoa said in statement on Tuesday. In fact, the study found that in the poorest communities, the risk of dying increased 60 percent in the wake of Hurricane Maria. And the risk of dying increased 35 percent for older Puerto Rican males. This means that though the exact causes of death may be varied or unclear, in the six months after Hurricane Maria, more people died than usual. This kind of statistical analysis allows researchers to say that the hurricane left groups of people extremely vulnerable after the storm, even if the flooding rains and wind didn't explicitly kill these individuals. Broken headstones pile up in a cemetery in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images Researchers and journalists alike have long speculated that Puerto Rico’s official death toll of 64 was suspiciously low. Back in 2017, a New York Times investigation estimated that the death toll was around 1,052 — nearly 1,000 more than the original calculation. This led the governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Roselló, to commission an independent study looking into the death toll in February 2018. “It is of great interest to the State to identify how many lives were lost due to the passage of Maria through the Island,"" Roselló said in a statement announcing the effort. ""It is our interest that experts can identify as accurately as possible the deaths directly and indirectly associated with the hurricane to improve protocols for future natural disasters.” In early July, researchers at Harvard released a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine which estimated that an excess of 4,500 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria by surveying more than 3,000 houses. Then in late July, the Puerto Rican government quietly acknowledged that the death toll was likely much higher than 64, after releasing a 400-page document that put the toll at more than 1,400 people. The government waited for the GW study to officially update the death toll. Broken tree branches pile up as workers push to clear out cemeteries in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images The newest count puts Hurricane Maria in second place as the deadliest hurricane to ever hit the United States, behind the Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900 which reportedly took 6,000 lives or more. Aside from the official death toll, the study also provided recommendations to Puerto Rico’s local government and the U.S. federal government to better prepare for the next deadly storm. The study suggests a more efficient way to tally deaths after disasters, a fully staffed Department of Health, better intra-department communication, and other recommendations. “The lessons learned from this report and subsequent studies will help not just Puerto Rico, but other regions in the U.S. and around the world that face the ongoing threat of hurricanes and other natural disasters,” co-author Lynn R. Goldman said. “If enacted, the recommendations of this report could help save lives in Puerto Rico and beyond.”","Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria one year ago next month.

Aria Bendix,"San Diego may be exposed to rising sea levels, but its coastal location gives it a host of advantages. According to research from Sarah Kapnick, a climate scientist at Princeton University, San Diego may have the most ideal weather of any US city. After studying the number of ""mild weather"" days — those suited for outdoor activities, with low precipitation, low humidity, and temperatures between 64 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit — Kapnick found that US summers are becoming hotter and more humid. By the end of the century, she discovered, cities in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico could lose weeks of mild weather due to climate change. This wasn't the case in San Diego, which currently boasts 180 days of mild weather per year compared to 157 in Los Angeles, 83 in New York, and just 76 in Boston. In the future, the city could see even more pristine weather conditions. Kapnick's study predicts that San Diego will gain three mild days per year by the end of the century. Perhaps the main concern for San Diego is a loss of precipitation, which can contribute to wildfires. That's a major worry, but one that nearly all California cities will have to face.","2017 was a record year for natural disasters in the US, with 16 severe weather events causing at least $306 billion in damages.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","As Hurricane Michael whirled toward Florida over a week ago, Meg Baldwin went into overdrive. As executive director of Refuge House, which works to end domestic violence in the Big Bend, she had to ensure her organization was ready for what she knew was coming: increased calls to their hotline, and a spike in urgent need for shelter from survivors and victims. Baldwins expectation didnt come out of nowhere. When disaster strikes, domestic violence followsnot just in Florida but around the world, according to the World Health Organization. The violence can take many forms, from child abuse to sexual violence to intimate partner violence. People like Baldwin have seen it all firsthand before. And with residents of the Panhandle still reeling from Michaels destruction, there are already signs that the cycle of violence could repeat itself. Weather events like these and disasters, in general, are opportunities for abusersboth domestic violence attackers and sexual assault perpetratorsto take advantage of the restrictive access survivors have to resources and to also take advantage of the isolation in the aftermath survivors experience, Baldwin told Earther. That isolation becomes even more intense and is even more of an opportunity for attackers to harm others. A considerable number of hotline calls came in before the storm in the eight northern Florida counties Refuge House serves, including hard-hit Wakulla and Gadsden counties, said Baldwin. People, largely women, were seeking immediate shelter (both from the storm and their abuser), and the Houses two emergency shelter locations were overcapacity by the time Hurricane Michael made landfall October 10 as a Category 4 storm. The shelters held more than 60 women between the two, compared with the usual 35 to 40, said Baldwin. A 20-person addition might not sound like a lot, but it is for this rural region. With the storm hitting those communities, it means that already-isolated victims are even more isolated. It means the resources of law enforcement intended for their protection has been sent to other needs. Escaping abusers is key during disasters because studies show that violence grows more severe in relationships that already experience it and its prevalence increases across the board, said Jennifer First, a mental health program manager at the Disaster and Community Crisis Center at the University of Missouri whos done extensive research in this area. And one doesnt need to look far back in the history books for proof. Take Hurricane Harvey, which struck Houston in August 2017. The number of domestic violence victims who sought help between January and August from the Crisis Center at the Katy Christian Ministries, which serves the West Houston area, more than doubled from 417 in 2017 to 1,025 this year. Reports of sexual abuse the center received nearly tripled, according to a report the center released earlier this week. For Hurricane Maria, the deadliest storm in modern U.S. history, the situation didnt look much better. Lack of power threatened the elderly and sick who needed machines for their medicine, but this darkness also left abuse survivors and victims on the island vulnerable, as Refinery 29 reported. After the storm, local nonprofit ESCAPE saw requests for survivor-related services increase by 62 percent. A similar spike in domestic violence has been documented after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. For some, this abuse can be deadly: Nearly half of all female homicide victims are killed by a current or former intimate partner, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly one in five women and about one in seven men report having experienced severe physical violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime, per the CDC. Women of color are especially at risk. Why? A lot of the data points to stress. She may have fewer housing choices, First said. She may have less social support. These are all risks that are often associated with domestic violence. After disasters like hurricanes strike, communities are more likely to experience employment loss, displacement, loss of housing, and financial issues. All this is especially true for communities of color and low-income neighborhoods already experiencing these inequalities. (Michael struck the states poorest region.) Even without a natural disaster, economic and housing challenges can increase the risk of domestic violence, First said. Throw a hurricane into the mix, and chaos can ensue. These communities and these families and these survivors were already very stressed before the storm arrived, said Baldwin from Refuge House to Earther. People are really living day to day, on the edge of being able to meet their basic needs, and thats a normal day. So with the storm hitting those communities, it means that already-isolated victims are even more isolated. It means the resources of law enforcement intended for their protection has been sent to other needs. States like New Jersey and Missouri have begun addressing the spike in domestic violence that accompanies natural disasters through training to emergency response teams and increased funding to domestic violence victims, but more needs to happenespecially in coastal communities in the South that deal with these hurricanes the most, said First. At least in the part of Florida Baldwin serves, her team at Refuge House goes door to door with relief agencies. The state brings the food and water, and Refuge House brings the counseling and comfort victims may seek during this tumultuous time. Theyve been doing this for the last 10 years and remain on the ground in wake of Hurricane Michael. While victims and survivors needed immediate shelter at first, in the weeks and months to come they may need help finding permanent housing or protection from an abuser. As the data shows us, the danger can last long after a storm passes. These coming weeks are just the beginning.","As Hurricane Michael whirled toward Florida over a week ago, Meg Baldwin went into overdrive.

Marguerite Reardon,"FCC commissioners (L to R) Brendan Carr, Mignon Clyburn, Ajit Pai, Michael O'Rielly, Jessica Rosenworcel. FCC The Federal Communications Commission will require emergency alerts sent to cell phones in a crisis to be more geographically precise. The agency voted at its meeting Tuesday on an item that ensures wireless providers send alerts that are more targeted to individuals affected by a natural disaster or other crises when sending alerts through the Wireless Emergency Alert system. The goal of updating the standard is to ensure that only people who are affected get messages, thus ensuring that people getting alerts will take the information seriously. Authorities have been reluctant in some cases to send out alerts because the messages would be broadcast over a much wider area than was necessary. These officials have said they didn't want to unnecessarily panic people or inundate them with warnings that did not pertain to them. ""Overbroad alerting can cause public confusion, lead some to opt out of receiving alerts altogether, and, in many instances, complicate rescue efforts by unnecessarily causing traffic congestion and overloading call centers,"" FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said. The update to the system comes as the nation's emergency alert system comes under increased scrutiny. Earlier this month, an official in Hawaii mistakenly alerted millions of people of an incoming ballistic missile, causing widespread panic. The false alert was not corrected for 38 minutes. FCC officials also presented preliminary results of an investigation at Tuesday's meeting that points to a mix of human error and poorly designed interfaces that resulted in the incident. The person responsible for the alert misinterpreted instructions and thought the alert was real. The FCC investigation is still ongoing. The FCC's effort to update the standard to make the WEAs more geographically precise started was before the incident in Hawaii took place. The FCC considered the item at the urging of the two California Senators, Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, who told the FCC that some local authorities in their state were reluctant to send out alerts during the deadly wildfires that burned through California last year. The FCC also adopted updates to the system in 2016 that require carriers to allow messages to be sent in multiple languages. It also increased the character limit for messages from 90 to 360. And messages will be able to support hyperlinks and multimedia. Those changes won't take effect until May of next year. CNET Magazine : Check out a sample of the stories in CNET's newsstand edition.

Peter Kotecki,"Communication networks are often the first to fail when natural disasters strike. More than 30 millions people in the United States already do not have quality internet connectivity, and this number rises by millions during a disaster. In an effort to make the internet more resilient, Mozilla runs the Off-The-Grid Internet Challenge, which rewards new ideas for deploying wireless communication to areas where internet access is unavailable. A company called Rhizomatica took home the $400,000 prize this year for HERMES, or the High­-frequency Emergency and Rural Multimedia Exchange System. HERMES does not rely on cables or satellites. Instead, it uses short-wave radio and Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) technology, which makes it reliable in rural areas and disaster scenarios, according to Rhizomatica. The system, contained in two suitcases, allows people to make local calls and send text messages, and it allows people who are not at disaster sites to relay information to those affected. ""In an emergency, you want to be able to tell people you're okay,"" Rhizomatica said in a statement. ""HERMES allows you to tell anyone, anywhere with a phone number that you're okay. And that person can respond to you over text or with a voice message."" Rhizomatica's main user-facing technology is 2G GSM, the most common digital communication technology worldwide. It also lets people connect to the network for a longer period of time, as it drains the battery minimally. ""By investing in affordable, scalable solutions like these, we can unlock opportunity for millions of Americans,"" Jim Kurose, head of the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation, which sponsors the competition, said in a statement. The version of HERMES presented at the Off-The-Grid Internet Challenge cost about $7,000, Peter Bloom, general coordinator at Rhizomatica, told Business Insider. Bloom said the company believes it can lower the cost significantly by using different hardware, and it hopes to offer HERMES for $1,000 one day. Rhizomatica has not yet decided whether it will sell HERMES as a standalone product for the public, Bloom said. It's more likely that the company will deploy the suitcases to organizations.","Internet connectivity can fail when natural disasters strike, and it is not available in some rural areas to begin with.

ELIZABETH WILLIAMSON and RON NIXON,"The Department of Homeland Security, which has a budget of more than $40 billion and a staff of more than 240,000, is a sprawling amalgam created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that cobbled together 22 government agencies. The department is responsible for everything from protecting the nation from cyberattacks to responding to natural disasters. But as the president rails about illegal immigration, Ms. Nielsen’s attention has been increasingly drawn to the department’s border security role. “Your priority, once you accept the job, is to echo the president’s priorities. She has done that,” said Tom Ridge, the first homeland security secretary, who said Ms. Nielsen has often sought out his advice. “But this president, with some of the things he sometimes does and says, has made her job harder.” At 46, Ms. Nielsen is the youngest person to lead the sprawling agency, and an unlikely choice for the job. She was a staff member at the agency before leading it, helping to set up the Transportation Security Administration, now an agency within homeland security, after the Sept. 11 attacks. She was later tapped to be a special assistant to President George W. Bush, working on the White House Homeland Security Council. After Mr. Trump’s surprise election victory, Ms. Nielsen volunteered for his transition team and helped prepare John F. Kelly, then the president-elect’s nominee for homeland security secretary, for his confirmation hearings. Mr. Kelly named Ms. Nielsen his chief of staff, and the two have moved in tandem through the Trump administration, becoming personal friends in the process.","John F.

TIM ARANGO and INYOUNG KANG,"Mr. Spangle put his military training to use during the fires, staking out a position that allowed him to spot brush fires at the start and mobilize others to quickly put them out before they spread. Many of the veterans said that with wildfires, as in wars, a special camaraderie bound those who were going through it together. The camaraderie, I would say, is the most familiar thing, said Travis Wilkerson, a former Marine who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and now serves on a helicopter crew with the Forest Service. That sense of brotherhood you have. Natural disasters, of course, are something different from wars, with their human combatants and causes. In conflicts, every person encountered is eyed suspiciously as a possible threat. With the fires, it is usually the opposite: neighbors coming together to help one another. What we are doing is helping our friends, said Candace Bowen, a Malibu resident who defied the evacuation order and stayed behind to help others.",A member of a search-and-rescue team checked inside a pile of debris while searching for victims of the Camp Fire in Paradise on Tuesday.,2018-11-14T13:59:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","California Today: California Today: In the Wake of the Fires, Memories of a War Zone",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/california-today-fires.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/14/us/14californiatoday-fire/14californiatoday-fire-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1
Shannon Connellan,"A magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the Indonesian island region of Sulawesi on Friday. The natural disasters claimed at least 1,234 lives, according to the death toll reported on Tuesday. Officials fear the toll will continue to rise. Most of these deaths have occurred in the coastal city of Palu, with many victims still to be located within the ruins. Mass burials have begun in the area, and thousands are now homeless across the region, sheltering in some 200 displacement sites. SEE ALSO: An Indonesian tsunami's devastation captured in new, horrifying video We don't know the full breadth of the impact of the disaster just yet. As Reuters reports, more remote areas have been out of contact for over three days, though rescuers are finally reaching those locations. Thousands of homes have collapsed in the Sulawesi region, along with hospitals, hotels, and shopping centers. Image: Carl Court/Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo has requested ""urgent"" international aid, and the global community is identifying different ways to assist Indonesia during the disaster. The hardest hit cities, Palu and the coastal city Donggala, are the most in need. According to Charity Navigator, officials are reporting that supplies like food, water, and medicine are running low, shelter is scarce for thousands of displaced people, and some of the affected areas are proving hard to reach. Clearing a path to reach victims and deliver aid is a priority. BBC reports that aid agencies have been struggling to access affected areas due to damage at Palu's main airport, roads cut off by landslides, and power is out across much of the region. So, how can you personally help? Here's our list of ways you can support survivors, which will be updated to reflect the ultimate scale of the earthquake and tsunami's devastation: 1. Donate to reputable nonprofits and charities. Charity Navigator has published a list of highly-rated organisations that are focused on delivering general aid and relief, medical services and hygiene kits, as well as food, water, toilets, and basic shelter. Here are the organisations listed as working on tsunami recovery for Indonesia: Heart to Heart International, World Vision, Direct Relief, Project HOPE, Water Mission, GlobalGiving, Save the Children, International Medical Corps, Helping Hand for Relief and Development, and World Help. Though not featured on Charity Navigator's list, Indonesian Red Cross Society (or Palang Merah Indonesia), Red Cross Australia, UNICEF, Oxfam, and CARE Australia, are organisations already on the ground or preparing to help victims. Indonesian Red Cross (or PMI) rescue workers use a tracked vehicle to move through an area destroyed by the tsunami in Palu. Image: Carl Court/Getty Images Doctors Without Borders has also deployed a local team to Central Sulawesi. The team includes medical, logistics, and water and sanitation specialists. 2. Consider ways to help the most vulnerable communities. Natural disasters affect people in different ways, but the most vulnerable communities are often overlooked in the aftermath. Humanity and Inclusion, a U.S.-based not-for-profit that promotes disability rights, is taking donations for basic aid and rehabilitation care for tsunami survivors with serious injuries and disabilities. Thousands of people have been left homeless from the tsunami, in addition to locals who were already experiencing homelessness. Consider donating to local, national, or international organisations that are trying to address the immediate crisis of homelessness. Oxfam, for example, is working with local Indonesian partners to deliver essential aid like emergency shelters, soap and sanitary items, water containers, tarps, and toilets. Some of the most vulnerable survivors of a natural disaster are the youngest among us. Consider supporting nonprofit groups that serve children. Save the Children is on the ground in Sulawesi, providing medical care, emotional support, and child-friendly spaces in shelters with diapers and cribs. 3. Keep checking in after the headlines have faded The fallout after a natural disaster is immense, but it eventually stops making headlines. Once the media coverage has ebbed, those affected by the disaster still have to piece together their lives. Keep checking in with your chosen charity to see how things are progressing, and check situation updates from the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance (AHA Center). Finally, if you need guidance on deciding which cause to support amongst so many worthy aid and recovery efforts, consult Charity Navigator's tips for how to give in a crisis. Strategies include giving money instead of material items and making long-term donations.","A magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the Indonesian island region of Sulawesi on Friday.

Cory Doctorow,"Though firms may worry about profits now that Trump's decision to let the world boil in its own juices rather than offend the hydrocarbon lobby (Coke may run out of water, Disney may run out of themepark-goers), the latest report from UK nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project shows that companies are also privately exulting in the new possibilities opened up by climate catastrophes and the ensuing hidden misery.

Wells Fargo looks forward to continuing its criminal and predatory financial practices by extending credit to people whose homes are damaged or demolished by floods, fires, etc: ""Preparation for and response to climate-change induced natural disasters result in greater construction, conservation and other business activities. [Our company]has the opportunity to provide financing to support these efforts.""
Home Depot predicts soaring demand for construction supplies in the wake of disasters and more air conditioners and fans as temperatures rise: ""[We will see] higher demand should temperatures increase over time.""
Google thinks that Google Earth will grow along with curiosity about disasters around the world: ""If customers value Google Earth Engine as a tool to examine the physical changes to the Earths natural resources and climate, this could result in increased customer loyalty or brand value. This opportunity driver could have a positive impact on our brands.""

KAREN ZRAICK,"Giving to the Cajun Navy Numerous volunteer rescue groups go by some variation of Cajun Navy. One registered nonprofit, Cajun Navy Relief, said that its volunteers, who include boaters, EMTs and firefighters, have extensive training and have conducted rescues in previous storms, like Hurricane Harvey last year. As Hurricane Florence approached the Carolinas, the Cajun Navy Relief deployed to an area near Lumberton, N.C., with bass boats, airboats and other vessels, said Josh Richard, a spokesman for the organization. The group has a PayPal account for monetary donations, which are needed to fill fuel containers and buy meals for boat teams and evacuees, among other costs. Go here to donate supplies. Animal shelters Before the storm hit, many local animal shelters scrambled to transport their charges to safe locations, or to get them adopted. The Atlanta Humane Society was caring for dozens of cats and dogs from Beaufort, S.C., and rushed to get other animals in shelters on the Carolina coast out of harm’s way. After Irma last year, the organization put up 1,000 animals in an emergency shelter, and if needed, it could reopen such a facility, said Christina Hill, a spokeswoman for the group. That protects animals in case shelters are damaged, and also frees up space for lost or displaced animals that come in after the storm. (Shelters that reach capacity are sometimes forced to euthanize animals after natural disasters.)","Avair Vereen, 39, left, her fiancé and one of her children at a Hurricane Florence evacuation shelter at Conway High School in South Carolina on Thursday.",2018-09-15T15:43:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Hurricane Florence: How to Help,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/reader-center/how-to-help-hurricane-florence-victims.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/15/us/15xp-shelters/15xp-shelters-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1
Michael Hardy,"After years of playing with fire, Kevin Cooley finally got burned. Inspired by the smoke signals used at the Vatican to signal the election of a new pope, the multimedia artist began setting controlled fires in and around his studio and photographing their multicolored plumes of smoke. In a way, it was the logical next step for an artist whose previous projects have examined earth, water, and wind, the other three classical elements.
But in 2017, Cooleys personal and professional lives unexpectedly intersected when the La Tuna fire nearly destroyed his Los Angeles home, which sits on a two-acre lot in the Tujunga neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley, between the Verdugo and San Gabriel Mountains. The fire broke out on September 1, and quickly began racing through the hills of the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank.
Cooley happened to be helping his son assemble an emergency preparedness kit for a school assignment when he first noticed smoke rising from behind a nearby hill. ""It was hard to tell how far away it was, because there was just this giant smoke column,"" he recalls. He and his family had just moved into the house after a six-month renovation; now they had to pack their most valuable belongings in a car in case they needed to evacuate. (At the top of Cooley's list: hard drives containing his digital photographs, and some old negatives.)
The night passed uneventfully, Cooley and his wife sleeping in shifts, but in the morning the fire crested a nearby hill, with only an empty expanse of dry chaparral between it and them. After helping his family evacuate, Cooley returned with his camera to document the possible immolation of his home. ""The only way I could process the fire was to photograph it,"" he says. ""I took a lot of the photographs from my driveway, essentially.""
The hard work of local firefighters saved the house, and Cooley continued photographing the aftermath of the fire, which eventually consumed over 7,000 acres, becoming one of the largest in Los Angeles history. Over the following weeks, Cooley was amazed to see the charred landscape showing early signs of recovery. ""The chaparral ecosystem only regenerates through fire,"" he says. ""It was amazing how fast it came back.""
After the close call with destruction, Cooley briefly considered leaving LA. ""But where do you go that's safe from natural disasters?"" he says. ""New York has flooding from hurricanes, the Midwest has tornadoes, anywhere in California has earthquakes. I really don't know where safe is."" Besides, he points out, unloading his house might prove a challenge for the immediate future.
""There's a charred landscape right behind methat's not exactly a great selling point.""

Mark Kaufman,"The warring inhabitants of Westeros — one of the four known continents in the Game of Thrones world — dread the planet's long, unforgiving winters. But a global warming event there, stoked by an influx of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, would likely be even more dire. Earlier this week, University of Bristol climate scientist Dan Lunt published a study that modeled the doubling of carbon dioxide on the Game of Thrones fantasy world. His results show that if these levels doubled over the course of a century, the average temperature on the planet would warm by over 2 degrees Celsius, or about 3.5 Fahrenheit. This climatic shift would make some areas nearly uninhabitable and unleash devastating natural disasters. SEE ALSO: Antarctica's ice walls are no match for The Wall in 'Game of Thrones' ""When you kick the climate, every single part of it changes,"" said Lunt in an interview. When not modeling the future climate of fantasy worlds, Lunt researches the mechanisms that influenced past climate change on Earth to better learn how future atmospheric changes will affect our planet. Lunt notes his work is ""relevant for Earth's policy makers as we burn more fossil fuels."" The position of the continents in the 'Game of Thrones' planetary model. Image: Dan Lunt / University of Bristol Lunt said it's ""not a giant leap to simulate climate change in a fantasy world."" The two degrees of simulated warming here — as carbon dioxide gases trap a nearby sun's reflected heat inside the world — would bring about extreme events like heavy rain, flooding, storm surges, and drought in different regions around the medieval-themed planet. ""Normally when you double the amount of CO2 then you tend to increase extreme events,"" explained Lunt. ""The system is so interconnected that every thing changes."" An important consequence of this warming for the peoples of the Seven Kingdoms would be thawed polar regions, which in the north is home to the murderous White Walkers — malevolent, supernatural humanoids that can only survive in frigid climes. ""It's a big change, especially the effects it would have on the White Walkers,"" said Lunt. ""It would push them back further north."" For people of Westeros, this is outwardly a good thing. The White Walkers — whose primary motivation seems to be annihilating people — would be sequestered far away in near the north pole. But, notes Lund, ""There are winners and losers in climate change."" For instance, the southern land of Dawn ""would probably become uninhabitably hot,"" he said. The climate models illustrate that the tilt of the planet must be ""relatively small,"" according to the study. Image: DAN LUNT / UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL The ornate castles and infrastructure of King's Landing — home to spiteful Cersei Lannister — also wouldn't be spared. ""King's Landing would be struggling in terms of sea level rise,"" Lunt said. Modeling a planet with only four known continents is no easy task. Fortunately, there are at least good maps of the known fantasy world, and the Game of Thrones books reveal what areas lie near the center, or equator. From here, Lunt was forced to make up other continents as he lacked any better options. Lunt also only had time to run the models for a century — so the warming effects could certainly have increased had more time passed, bringing more natural terror to the Seven Kingdoms. After the models were finished, there seemed to be few places that were desirable to live. When asked where he might reside in such a climate-ravaged world, Lunt replied The Neck on the Westeros continent, where nearly the entire Stark family was murdered in a surprise bloodbath. ""It looks nice there,"" he said.","The warring inhabitants of Westeros — one of the four known continents in the Game of Thrones world — dread the planet's long, unforgiving winters.

Mark Kaufman,"The Svalbard Global Seed Vault — purposely isolated on a remote island some 800 miles from the North Pole — will be upgraded to make the concrete structure more resilient to the whims of weather and climate. The vault is now 10 years old, and the Norway government, which funds and manages the vault, announced that it's time for nearly $13 million in upgrades. Specifically, Norway plans to build a new concrete tunnel and a building to protect emergency power and refrigerating units. SEE ALSO: Doomsday-proof vault in the Arctic receives a major deposit of seeds Norway says the vault is ""built to stand the test of time."" It's a long-term storage facility for the globe's stock of crop seeds, should the world's agriculture become threatened or imperiled by ""war, terrorism and natural disasters."" Seeds stored and organized in boxes in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Image: Landbruks- og matdepartementet Over 5,000 species of crop plants — like beans, potatoes, and rice — are currently stored in the vault, although the vault is designed to contain far more. It's designed to hold 2.25 billion seeds, encompassing 4.5 million crop varieties. The rationale is to maintain a rich genetic diversity of seeds for each crop, increasing the plant's resiliency to different environmental conditions — should the seeds have to be planted. In 2015, for example, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas took seeds from the vault and planted them in Syria for research purposes. The organization then returned the seeds to Svalbard after harvest. A tunnel inside the seed vault. Image: Matthias Heyde The seed bank had already been planning to do some retrofitting to keep some ""water intrusion"" from getting into the tunnel.

Jason Schreier,"One of Final Fantasy XIV ’s most memorable bosses is Good King Moggle Mog, a giant demonic moogle whose Tim Burton-inspired theme song has been haunting players since the game’s earliest days. As it turns out, the king of the Moogles has an unlikely origin: one of Japan’s biggest natural disasters. At E3 in Los Angeles earlier this month, I asked Final Fantasy XIV composer Masayoshi Soken where that ridiculous chanting song had come from, and he told me the whole origin story of Good King Moggle Mog, a Primal enemy who launched during Final Fantasy XIV 1.0, before the developers at Square Enix took down the game and re-launched it as A Realm Reborn in 2013. “We were working on two Primals at the time, Leviathan and Titan,” said Soken, speaking through a translator. “But of course March 11 happened with the tsunami and the earthquake.” That’d be March 11, 2011, the day a massive earthquake hit Japan, triggering a tsunami and killing thousands upon thousands of people. Given that Final Fantasy ’s Leviathan and Titan, beasts of water and earth, use “Tsunami” and “Earthquake” as their respective main spells, the team suddenly had to pivot. “Leviathan and Titan being ‘Tsunami’ and ‘Earthquake,’ there was no way we could release this content,” Soken said. “We were scrambling wondering: ‘What could we have the players fight?’ The only thing we had the models for was Moogles. There was a Moogle theme that Mr. Uematsu had previously composed, so I took that and made it have more of a devil feel to it. Moogles as you know are floating around, being cheerful. Imagine that gigantified and trying to beat up the players. In my mind I was thinking, ‘How do you take that song, cute cheerful song, and make it more devil-like?’” The final product, which Soken admits was very inspired by Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas, doesn’t sound devil-like at all. In fact, it’s one of the silliest things in the game: “But I mean, listening to the finished product it still sounds very comical,” said Soken. “With the original source music being so comical, I guess no matter how you tweak it, it still came off comical.”","One of Final Fantasy XIV ’s most memorable bosses is Good King Moggle Mog, a giant demonic moogle whose Tim Burton-inspired theme song has been haunting players since the game’s earliest days.

JOSIE THADDEUS-JOHNS,"From the beginning of our collaboration, we were interested in fiction and reality, said Mr. Sonderegger, on a tour of the exhibition, titled Double Take and running through June 1, ahead of its opening. The Swiss duo said they were particularly interested in historically significant shots, like the one taken from a helicopter flying over Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11, 2001, showing United Airlines Flight 175 fly toward the South Tower of the World Trade Center. 
A lot of images are really like a symbol for a change of something, Mr. Sonderegger said. If you look at the history, you see that this image stands for this period, or for the end of this period.
The pairs choice of photographs reflects this focus. For example, one recreates a shot of the tsunami that hit Southeast Asia in 2004, using epoxy resin, plastic wrap and feathers; another the shallow crater made by a boot on the moon, the artists own Converse footprints marking the border of the mock-up. Each of these images had a momentous effect on the international audiences that saw them.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","Protest at the White House in 2017. (Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images) Matt Vespa, Townhall.com : “Global warming has consistently been ranked the least important issue with voters for years. This is an Acela Corridor concern, where rich liberals can whine and advocate about reducing carbon emission with zero economic blowback. For rural America, millions of Americans will be out of work. No job retraining will do any good... and economic growth and activity could be severely curtailed. The job losses would be staggering. We’re the Saudi Arabia of coal, with enough to power our country and our economy for centuries. We’re at our most industrialized in the U.S. and air quality couldn’t be better. Sorry, the science is not settled on this matter. We’re going to hear about extreme weather in the coming days — and how President Donald Trump is some semi-God who conjured it out of thin air, or something — but we had the calmest hurricane season in 30 years back in 2013. In that same year, we experienced the quietest tornado season in 60 years.” OUR VIEW: As Hurricane Florence creeps in, Trump seeks stormy deregulation Ned Barnett, The (Raleigh, North Carolina) News &amp; Observer : “As Hurricane Florence bears down on the Carolinas this week, Trump (said), ‘We are absolutely and totally prepared.’ He may be right about federal emergency readiness — we’ll see — but he’s plainly wrong about the nation’s broader preparation for weather calamities. This president is doing the opposite of preparing. In the face of climate change that is clearly contributing to more powerful storms, droughts, floods, rising seas levels and wildfires, Trump is dropping the nation’s guard.... In the next week or so, the president may be in North Carolina to survey the wreckage from Florence. But such damage in the future will be intensified by his own big wind that’s upending efforts to avert climate change. Call it Hurricane Donald.” Miami Herald, editorial : “When it comes to extreme weather, Trump is complicit.... With depressingly ironic timing, the Trump administration announced Tuesday a plan to roll back federal rules on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is the main component in natural gas. Drillers and transporters of the fuel were supposed to be more careful about letting it waft into the atmosphere, which is nothing more than rank resource waste that also harms the environment. The Trump administration has now attacked all three pillars of President Barack Obama’s climate-change plan. The president has cemented the GOP’s legacy as one of reaction and reality denial. Sadly, few in his party appear to care.” Emily Rosko, CNN.com : ""Projected track lines across the Carolinas look as though a toddler has scribbled all over the map. Charleston sits on the edge of the cone of uncertainty. The schools, the college campus where I work, all the city offices are all closed. My family is leaving our house on the Charleston Peninsula to go inland — the third time in three consecutive falls.... Time moves strangely when a hurricane eyes you from the ocean....

"Ari Phillips on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","President Trump’s political appointee nomination process is opaque, and oftentimes just ass-backwards. So when it was announced Friday that former astronaut and geosciences PhD James Reilly was being nominated to direct the U.S. Geological Survey, there were certainly some double takes. According to Nature, Reilly is only the second person with a science PhD to be nominated by Trump to lead a science agency, the other being Francis Collins, director of the US National Institutes of Health. If confirmed by the Senate, Reilly would join Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke’s leadership team in a position with plenty of room for controversy. The USGS is the DOI’s scientific arm, with scientists focusing on managing and monitoring landscapes, natural resources, and natural hazards. It’s likely Reilly, who was a chief geologist at Dallas-based oil and gas company Enserch Exploration for over a decade before joining NASA and logging 856 hours in space, will play a key role in helping Trump’s team mine more earth. In December, Trump issued an executive order calling on the U.S. to reduce foreign reliance on critical minerals, used in the manufacture of everything from cars to phones to wind turbines. Around the same time, the USGS published its first full new assessment of the country’s critical mineral resources since 1973, which found that 20 out of the 23 critical minerals the nation relies on are primarily sourced from China. The EO directs Zinke to come up with a strategy in six months and calls for “new sources of critical minerals” on U.S. soil and the streamlining of the “leasing and permitting process to expedite production.” Seems like something Reilly, who got his undergraduate, master’s and doctoral degrees in geosciences from the University of Texas at Dallas, could help with. Zinke is also a top proponent of the administration’s “America First” energy plan, which entails seeking out new sources of coal, oil, and gas both on and offshore. Reilly’s expertise could also be lent to this endeavor. David S. Abraham, a senior fellow at the think tank New America, told Earther that “it’s more significant that he has a background in oil rather than space for this administration.” Even as Trump calls for more domestic critical resources, he is diminishing the USGS’s own resources. As Science reports, last year the Trump administration sought to cut USGS’s $1.1 billion budget by 15 percent. This could have serious negative repercussions, as the bureau is also responsible for monitoring and studying natural disasters, managing water resources, and overseeing the Earth-observing Landsat satellites. In July, Debra Willard, coordinator for the USGS Climate Research and Development Program, sent an open letter to colleagues around the world warning that the Trump administration’s proposed 2018 budget cuts threaten dozens of important data-gathering programs relating to everything from climate change to volcanoes. Per Science, the proposed budget cuts primarily targeted “programs focused on climate change as well as initiatives in earthquake early warning and volcanic hazard monitoring, among others.” Now that Reilly’s nomination—which has long been expected—is official, maybe Trump can move on to considering other science-minded folks for important scientific posts, such as, I don’t know, a science advisor? Unlikely. A recent report from the Union of Concerned Scientists found that after a year, the administration has shown “an unprecedented level of stalled and disbanded scientific advisory committees, cancelled meetings, and dismissed experts.” The analysis found that fewer than a quarter of the hundreds of appointed positions have been filled, including director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, who usually serves as the President’s top science advisor.","President Trump’s political appointee nomination process is opaque, and oftentimes just ass-backwards.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE and JILL COWAN,"There are beautiful things happening all the time in the midst of all this sadness, said Sandra Bernstein, director of the Mother and Baby Care Center at Enloe Medical Center in Chico, which took on patients who had originally planned to deliver at the damaged hospital in Paradise. Still, new and expecting mothers contend with unique health challenges during natural disasters, one of the biggest being the inability to find a safe place to give birth, said Dr. Nicole Smith, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard Medical School. Other concerns involve contaminated water, stress, trauma and depression. As smoke contaminated the air, mothers feared for their babies health. I was afraid that the smoke would cause her asthma, Ms. Tellez Flores, 24, said. Like Ms. Tellez Flores, Kamber Wright, 31, was supposed to deliver in Paradise. When the fire began, Ms. Wright was less than a week away from her due date, asleep in the house she and her husband purchased recently. It took her more than four hours to drive from Paradise to Chico time spent worrying that shed go into labor as her house (and the babys jungle-themed nursery) turned to ash in the rearview mirror. Her son, Grayson James, was born on Nov. 13. Hes too small to wear a mask, Ms. Wright said.

,"A massive new federal report warns that extreme weather disasters are worsening in the United States. The National Climate Assessment was written long before the deadly fires in California this month and Hurricanes Florence and Michael raked the East Coast and Florida. It says warming-charged extremes ""have already become more frequent, intense, widespread or of long duration."" (MORE: Read the report here ) The federal report says the last few years have smashed records for damaging weather in the U.S., costing nearly $400 billion since 2015. ""Warmer and drier conditions have contributed to an increase in large forest fires in the western United States and interior Alaska,"" according to the report. ""We are seeing the things we said would be happening, happen now in real life,"" said report co-author Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University. ""As a climate scientist, it is almost surreal."" And report co-author Donald Wuebbles, a University of Illinois climate scientist, said, ""We're going to continue to see severe weather events get stronger and more intense."" The air pollution from wildfires combined with heat waves is a major future health risk for the West, the report says. During the fires in northern California, air quality hit ""hazardous"" levels, according to government air monitoring agencies. ""There's real concern about how the West will be able to manage this increasing occurrence,"" said report co-author Kristie Ebi, a University of Washington public health professor. She said global warming is already harming people's health, but it will only get worse. The report is mandated by law every few years and is based on hundreds of previous research studies. It details how global warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas is hurting each region of United States and how it impacts different sectors of the economy, including energy and agriculture. ""Climate change is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life, the economy, and the natural systems that support us,"" the report says. That includes worsening air pollution causing heart and lung problems, more diseases from insects, the potential for a jump in deaths during heat waves, and nastier allergies. What makes the report different from others is that it focuses on the United States, then goes more local and granular. NOAA is one of 13 federal agencies that contributed significantly to the Fourth National Climate Assessment. ""All climate change is local,"" said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Richard Alley, who wasn't part of the report but praised it. While scientists talk of average global temperatures, people feel extremes more, he said. ""We live in our drought, our floods and our heat waves. That means we have to focus on us,"" he said. The Lower 48 states have warmed 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) since 1900 with 1.2 degrees in the last few decades, according to the repot. By the end of the century, the U.S. will be 3 to 12 degrees (1.6 to 6.6 degrees Celsius) hotter depending on how much greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, the report warns. Outside scientists and officials from 13 federal agencies wrote the report, which was released on the afternoon following Thanksgiving. It was originally scheduled for December. The report often clashes with the president's past statements and tweets on the legitimacy of climate change science, how much of it is caused by humans, how cyclical it is and what's causing increases in recent wildfires. Trump tweeted this week about the cold weather hitting the East including: ""Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?"" Friday's report seemed to anticipate such comments, saying: ""Over shorter timescales and smaller geographic regions, the influence of natural variability can be larger than the influence of human activity... Over climate timescales of multiple decades, however, global temperature continues to steadily increase."" Releasing the report on Black Friday ""is a transparent attempt by the Trump Administration to bury this report and continue the campaign of not only denying but suppressing the best of climate science,"" said study co-author Andrew Light, an international policy expert at the World Resources Institute. Trump, administration officials and elected Republicans frequently say they can't tell how much of climate change is caused by humans and how much is natural. Citing numerous studies, the new climate report says more than 90 percent of the current warming is caused by humans. Without greenhouse gases, natural forces such as changes in energy from the sun would be slightly cooling Earth. ""There are no credible alternative human or natural explanations supported by the observational evidence,"" the report says. Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.","The Weather Channel US Should Expect Worsening Weather Disasters, New Government Climate Report Warns The Weather Channel A massive new federal report warns that extreme weather disasters are worsening in the United States.

Up to 57,000 people could be forced to leave the US by 5 January 2020, when their temporary protected status (TPS) will be revoked. Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1999. The Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster. The 2020 deadline gives time for people with TPS ""to arrange for their departure or to seek an alternative lawful immigration,"" the statement reads. Honduras's government said it ""profoundly regrets"" the end of the programme. The country's ambassador to the US, Marlon Tabora, said the country could not handle repatriating tens of thousands of people, Reuters news agency reports.

The Trump administration previously announced plans to cancel TPS for immigrants from Haiti and El Salvador, which they had been given after natural disasters in those countries. Critics believe the US government is ignoring continuing dangers in home countries in its decisions to cancel TPS. But some argue the repeated extension of the programme has resulted in de facto residency rights for those who benefit. A legal group in Boston, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, said they would amend a legal complaint about the recent cancellation of TPS status to include the Hondurans.

Rachel Becker,"When Hurricane Michael crashed into the Florida Panhandle on October 10th, the storm cut power to parts of Florida and Georgia in its path, new NASA images show. The pictures are a stark reminder of our energy infrastructure’s vulnerability to natural disasters. The pictures went up today on NASA’s Earth Observatory blog, but lights have started to turn back on since the “after” image was snapped on October 12th. At this point, the number of customers without power has dropped to 163,000 from the 2.6 million that lost power after the storm, according to the Edison Electric Institute. (To be clear, that count reflects the number of meters that aren’t getting electricity, not the number of people, which is probably higher.) Some areas may have to wait weeks or even months for the grid to be repaired enough for the power to turn back on, NASA’s Earth Observatory says. That’s a lot of time for people to be without electricity for things like powering refrigerators, charging up medical devices, and running AC units. So why don’t hurricane-prone regions like Florida bury their power lines instead of stringing them up just to be torn down by powerful winds? Last year, 6.7 million of Florida’s electricity customers lost power after Hurricane Irma hit, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That’s almost two-thirds of the customers in the state. It’s a question that Ted Kury, director of energy studies at the University of Florida, has been studying. And the answer is: it’s complicated, he writes in an article for The Conversation. Sure, burying power lines underground keeps them safe from wind, but it can also increase the risk that storm surge and flooding could damage the wires. Plus, putting wires underground is expensive, and it can make it more difficult to get at the power lines for repairs. Power companies have to weigh the pros and cons of undergrounding versus more mainstream strategies like making sure a stiff wind won’t topple trees onto power lines. And as climate change increases hurricane intensity, the stakes for that calculation will continue to rise.","When Hurricane Michael crashed into the Florida Panhandle on October 10th, the storm cut power to parts of Florida and Georgia that were in its path, new NASA images show.

President Trump indicated on Thursday that he is considering declaring a national emergency if Congress doesnt deliver funding for a border wall. Jimmy Kimmel questioned whether it made any sense to spend money primarily meant for confronting natural disasters on a wall.
Hes making plans now to declare a national emergency on the border. The idea, I guess, is to declare an emergency and then take money that has been earmarked for real emergencies, like floods and hurricanes, and use it for a wall that wont do anything instead. Sometimes Im kind of amazed he only bankrupted three casinos. JIMMY KIMMEL
Trump often tells horror stories about what happens at the border, and hes recently made two allegations that caught reporters attention: that women are often tied up with duct tape by Mexican smugglers, and that Muslim prayer mats have been found strewn at the border. Kimmel pointed out that these claims have something notable in common and its not just that theyre unsubstantiated.
The White House looked into this and found no evidence to back up the president. Its a bad sign when even the White House is like, We have no idea what hes talking about either. And even nuttier, someone figured this out: The prayer mats and duct tape, these were all plot points from the movie Sicario.

STEPHEN WRIGHT and EILEEN NG / AP,"(PALU, Indonesia) — Christians dressed in their tidiest clothes flocked to Sunday sermons in the earthquake and tsunami damaged Indonesian city of Palu, seeking answers as the death toll from the twin disasters breached 1,700 and officials said they feared more than 5,000 others could be missing. Indonesia’s disaster agency said the number of dead had climbed to 1,763, mostly in Palu. Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said many more people could be buried, especially in the Palu neighborhoods of Petobo and Balaroa, where more than 3,000 homes were damaged or sucked into deep mud when the Sept. 28 quake caused loose soil to liquefy. “Based on reports from village chiefs in Balaroa and Petobo, some 5,000 people have not been found. Our workers on the ground are trying to confirm this,” he said at a news briefing in Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital. Nugroho said that efforts to retrieve decomposed bodies in deep, soft mud were getting tougher and that some people may have fled or been rescued and evacuated. More than 8,000 either injured or vulnerable residents have been flown or shipped out of Palu, while others could have left by land, he said. Officially, Nugroho said only 265 people are confirmed missing and 152 others still buried under mud and rubble, nine days after the magnitude 7.5 earthquake and powerful tsunami hit Palu and surrounding areas. The government targets to end search operations by Thursday, nearly two weeks after the disaster, at which time those unaccounted for will be declared missing and considered dead, Nugroho said. In Palu on Sunday, at least 200 people, including soldiers, filled the gray pews of the Protestant Manunggal church for a service. They sang as a young girl in a black and white dress with a red bow danced in the aisle, prayed and listened to a 30-minute sermon from the pastor, Lucky Malonda. A woman in the front pew wept. Min Kapala, a 49-year-old teacher, said she came to the city of more than 25 churches from an outlying area because her usual house of worship was destroyed and liquefaction moved a different piece of ground to its location. “I’m here at this particular church because my own church is no more; it’s leveled, and on its location there’s a corn plant,” she said. “That was very strange to me.” Outside the church, Malonda said the intensity of the disaster had taken even scientists by surprise and called it the will of God. Two people from his congregation were missing, he said. “This is for sure part of godly intervention, not outside the power of almighty God, that can’t be predicted or planned for by anything,” Malonda said. He said religious leaders are discussing holding inter-faith prayers but nothing has been agreed yet. Protestants, Catholics and Charismatics make up about 10 percent of the population of Palu, the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi. The province has a history of violent conflict between Muslims and Christians, though tensions have calmed in the past decade. Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim country. As searchers continued to dig through rubble Sunday, Central Sulawesi Gov. Loki Djanggola said local officials were meeting with religious groups and families of victims to seek their consent to turn neighborhoods wiped out by liquefaction into mass graves. He said on local television that survivors in the Petobo, Balaroa and Jono Oge neighborhoods could be relocated and monuments be built in the areas, which now look like wastelands, to remember the victims interred there. Officials have said that it is not safe for heavy equipment to operate in those areas and that they fear the risk of the spread of disease from decomposed bodies. While grappling with immediate relief needs, the government is also mapping out plans to help more than 70,000 people, including tens of thousands of children, who have been displaced by the disasters to rebuild their lives. Social welfare officials have set up nurseries in makeshift tents as a stopgap to keep children safe and help them heal from the trauma. Market vendors have resumed business and roadside restaurants were open in Palu, but long lines of cars and motorcycles still snarled out of gas stations. In Jakarta, volunteers walked around thoroughfares empty of cars collecting donations for earthquake victims during the weekly car-free morning in the city center. ___ Ng reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.","Indonesia's disaster agency said the number of dead had climbed to 1,763 after an earthquake and tsunami hit the nation in Sept.",2018-10-07T14:18:48Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Death Toll for Recent Indonesian Natural Disasters Reaches 1,700, Officials Say",http://time.com/5417970/death-toll-indonesia-natural-disasters/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/indonesia-death-toll-rises.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Natural disasters,1
"David Nield, David Nield","In an emergency, your smartphone can be a lifeline. And we're not just talking about calling 911. When you're lost, in need of first aid, stuck in a potentially dangerous situation, or even facing down a natural disaster, a plethora of apps can help. We picked out 16 potentially-lifesaving apps—download them now so you'll have them on hand when you need them. If you get lost Our phones come with mapping apps that constantly log our position in real time as we wander the planet. But even if you rely on Apple Maps or Google Maps, they won't always save you from getting lost. So supplement them with a few other apps that help users find their way. Here WeGo (free for Android and iOS ) provides a decent alternative to Google Maps or Apple Maps. It makes a great pick if you're traveling abroad, because it lets you download maps in advance, so you can use them even without an internet connection. When you're walking or driving, it excels at giving turn-by-turn directions, and when you want to take a taxi or public transit, it includes pricing details. Citymapper (free for Android and iOS ), like Here WeGo, offers functionality that you'll also find in the native mapping apps from Google and Apple. However, it gives you a number of bonus features that make it easier to navigate public transit without losing your way. For example, while you're waiting for a ride, it gives you real-time updates on the location of your bus or train, and once you board, the app can alert you when your stop is approaching. Google Translate (free for Android and iOS ) remains the best option for making yourself understood in unfamiliar surroundings. After all, perhaps the best method of getting directions is asking for them. This app lets you input text or scan road and direction signs with your phone's camera, and then receive translations as written text or read aloud. Just remember to cache the languages you'll need ahead of time, so you can access them offline later. Gaia GPS ($20/year for Android and iOS ) makes a great choice for those who plan to leave the city behind for the hiking trail. You can download all of its high-quality topographic, satellite, and road maps to use them offline, and you can check out hiking routes crowdsourced from the user community. Finally, intelligent routing tools will help you find the best way from A to B to make sure you get home safely. If you need first aid Your phone can't exactly give you CPR, but if someone needs medical attention, it can tell you what to do. Of course, your first course of action should be to call 911 and get advice from a professional. Then, as you're waiting for the ambulance to arrive, these apps can lend a hand—even if you don't have phone service. First Aid: American Red Cross (free for Android and iOS ) has essential advice for just about every emergency medical situation you're likely to encounter. Just as importantly, it puts this information into step-by-step guides and videos that are clear and easy to follow. Plus, everything works just as well without an internet connection. St John Ambulance First Aid (free for Android and iOS ) is another reputable, well-designed first aid app. It covers everything from choking and drowning to colds and allergic reactions. Step-by-step illustrations and voice instructions ensure that you follow the correct procedures. WebMD (free for Android and iOS ) shows you useful information about illnesses, symptoms, treatments, and other health topics. For first aid, it has a neatly laid-out section that also works offline. If you'd prefer to consult a professional, the app can also direct you to the nearest physician. Offline Survival Manual (free for Android ) will protect you in the great outdoors. It provides excellent first-aid information on topics like bites, stings, and environmental injuries. Plus, to prevent those injuries from happening in the first place, it offers advice on staying safe, finding shelter, making fires, and much more. This app is only available on Android, but if you want a comparable alternative for your iPhone, try SAS Survival Guide ($6 for iOS ). If you want to send an SOS When you're visiting a new place alone, or going on a first date with a relative stranger, you feel safer knowing that a trusted friend is aware of your plans—just in case. These apps will help you send a digital SOS if you suspect you're in danger. Again, we always recommend trying to contact official emergency services before you do anything else, but if you need a backup, try one of these genuinely useful options. Life360 (free for Android and iOS ) is an all-in-one tracking system that lets users know where their loved ones are at any given time. This tracking function works in the background, but if you need to call for help, you can send an alert to your circle of friends and family members to tell them something's wrong. The company also offers a $3/month paid version of this system, which provides a longer location history and additional alerts. Kitestring (free on the web ) is a service (it's not an app, but it does work over text messages) you can use if you're worried you might be heading into danger. You set a time when you want Kitestring to check in, and it will text you then. If you don't respond to the Kitestring message, it alerts a pre-selected contact so that person can check up on you. React Mobile (free for Android and iOS ) can help you in situations ranging from the slightly uncomfortable to the downright dangerous. First, you add a list of trusted contacts to the app. Then you can hit a Follow Me button to invite them to keep an eye on your GPS location, so they can make sure you get home safely. In case of real peril, you can tap the Help Me button to alert your friends and call emergency services at the same time. The app can also work with a physical button on a $70 Bluetooth-enabled fob. The hardware might be expensive, but some people find it easier, or more discreet, to press a fob than to unlock and tinker with a phone. Noonlight ($3/month for Android and iOS ) gives you a direct line to a ""qualified dispatcher"" who can assist you or contact the police. It works across a variety of devices, including smart speakers and wearables, so you can alert that dispatcher through a button on your phone, a voice command to your Amazon Echo, a motion alert on your smart security camera, and other sources. If you face a natural disaster Depending on where you live, you may regularly have to deal with hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, or other natural disasters. If you're living or traveling in a r egion where these events happen frequently, you should stock up on one of these emergency apps. Earthquake: American Red Cross (free for Android and iOS ) focuses comprehensively on, as the name indicates, earthquakes. It will let you receive alerts about affected zones, track hazards on a map, and read essential advice about how to act in the face of an ongoing natural disaster. The Red Cross also makes similar apps for tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods, so you can find the perfect choice for your specific situation. Weather Underground (free for Android and iOS ) excels at providing severe weather alerts well in advance. Get notifications about incoming storms or tornadoes, and then consult the detailed forecasts and radar maps to discover when the danger will pass—and where you'll be safe to stay until then. You can also pay for a $2/year subscription, which removes all ads. FEMA (free for Android and iOS ) comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, so you can trust the information it provides. This information includes weather warnings, safety tips, the locations of shelters, and contact information for FEMA agents. The app also lets you upload photos of what's going on in your area, which can help first responders. Zello (free for Android and iOS ) turns your phone into a walkie-talkie. This is ideal in a situation when the regular phone lines are jammed or entirely down. With Zello, as long as you have some kind of internet connectivity—whether Wi-Fi or cellular—you can keep in touch with friends and family.","DIY Apply first aid, face natural disasters, and more.

Brian Heater,"On our final day in Pittsburgh, we find ourself in a decommissioned coal mine. Just northeast of the city proper, Tour-Eds owners run field trips and tours during the warmer months, despite the fact that the mines innards run a constant 50 degrees or so, year round.
With snow still melted just beyond the entrance, a team of students from Carnegie Mellon and Oregon State University are getting a pair of robots ready for an upcoming competition. The small team is one of a dozen or so currently competing in DARPAs Subterranean Challenge.
The multi-year SUbT competition is designed to explore new approaches to rapidly map, navigate, search, and exploit complex underground environments, including human-made tunnel systems, urban underground, and natural cave networks. In particular, teams are tasked with search and rescue missions in underground structures, ranging from mines to caves to subway stations.
The goal of the $2 million challenge is design a system capable of navigating complex underground terrains, in case of cave-ins or other disasters. The robots are created to go where human rescuers cant or, at very least, shouldnt.
The CMU teams solution features multiple robots, with a foul-wheeled rover and a small, hobbyist style drone taking center state. Our system consists of ground robots that will be able to track and follow the terrain, says CMUs Steve Willits, who serves as an adviser on the project. We also have an unmanned aerial vehicle consisting of a hexacopter. Its equipped with all of instrumentation that it will need to explore various area of the mine.
The rover uses a combination of 3D cameras and LIDAR to navigate and map the environment, while looking for humans amid the rubble. Should it find itself unable to move, due to debris, small passage ways or a manmade obstacle like stairs, the drone is designed to lift off from the rear and continue the search.
All the while, the rover drops ultra rugged WIFI repeaters off its rear like a breadcrumb trail, extending its signal in the process. Most of this is still early stages. While the team was able to demonstrate the rover and drone in action, it still hasnt mastered a method for getting them to work in tandem.
Testing the robots will begin in September, with the Tunnel Circuit Thats followed in March 2020 by the manmade Urban Circuit and then a Cave Circuit that September. A final event will be held in September 2012.","On our final day in Pittsburgh, we find ourself in a decommissioned coal mine.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Hundreds of thousands of people had to evacuate their homes in Southern California over the span of a week due to wildfires sweeping the region. In response to the ongoing devastation, Apple announced on Monday that it is donating $1 million to aid in relief efforts. “Our thoughts are with all those affected by the fires in Southern California, including our colleagues, friends and their families,” the company said in a statement, posted in a tweet by KTLA reporter Rich DeMuro. “Apple is donating $1 million to aid in the rebuilding and recovery efforts of the communities that have been impacted.” We have reached out to Apple for comment on how it determined the amount of its donation and where, specifically, it is donating the money. Apple has donated to relief efforts in the past. It donated $1 million to Northern California wildfire relief efforts in October and also matched employee donations. And without question it’s a good thing to provide resources following natural disasters. But it’s also important to understand just how impactful these contributions are. Apple is worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and it’s on the brink of becoming a trillion-dollar company. One million dollars is generous, but the cost of wildfires is astoundingly more than that. Cal Fire has an emergency fund budget of $426 million, KCRA reported, but it cost the department approximately $70 million more than that to fight wildfires from July 1 through December 7. “This is the worst season I’ve had — the longest, most devastating, most loss of life, most loss of structures,” Michael Bradley, Northern California assistant region fire chief, told KCRA. “Rate of spread is extreme.” I’m not shitting on Apple for donating 1,000 iPhone X’s-worth of money to help wildfire relief efforts, but Apple is the largest public company in the world. It’s important to remember how much Apple’s worth, versus how much it donated, versus how much is really needed to help. This is good, albeit incremental, support. But it’s also great PR for the tech giant.

I spent a Thanksgiving night at a Walmart parking lot in Bakersfield for the Black Friday rush. I tracked down family members walking the rocky banks of the Kern River looking for a corrections officer that had disappeared in the rapids, and I checked on Legoland during the wildfires that ripped through San Diego County in 2014. I wrote about the boycott of a Newport Beach Christmas Boat Parade. When an Asiana Airlines flight crashed at SFO, I spent the day camped out at San Francisco General Hospital not yet named for Mark Zuckerberg. But none of that explains why I love the Golden State.

RON NIXON,"As homeland security secretary, Ms. Nielsen will be responsible for carrying out the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce immigration. She will also be responsible for aviation security, domestic counterterrorism and preparations for natural and man-made disasters. Additionally, she will oversee the hiring of 5,000 new Border Patrol agents and 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Mr. Trump, in a January executive order, called for an increase in the number of immigration officers to secure the nation’s borders and get tough on illegal immigration. The House has approved funding for an increase in funding for new Border Patrol agents, but the Senate has not acted on the legislation. Ms. Nielsen will face a number of challenges. Even as the department tries to hire new Border Patrol agents, it is losing them at a faster rate. The agency has had trouble retaining agents who face polygraph requirements, working in remote locations and receiving lower annual pay compared with other law enforcement jobs. Annual turnover rates averages 6 percent for the Border Patrol. And reports by the Homeland Security inspector general released in the past few months have questioned a number of programs at the agency. One report questioned the contributions of the federal air marshal program, which places armed marshals on commercial flights to protect passengers and crews against a terrorist attack. The report said funding for the program, which costs about $10 billion a year, could be put to better use. Another report found that T.S.A. screeners at the nation’s airports continue to struggle to identify weapons and bombs at security checkpoints. Undercover agents for the inspector general managed to slip fake weapons pass screeners nearly half the time, according to a person with knowledge of the report, which remains classified. Ms. Nielsen worked at the T.S.A. after it was created as a response to the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. She left the government in 2007, serving as a private-sector consultant who helped government entities and private companies devise plans to guard against cyberattacks. Ms. Nielsen also served on President George W. Bush’s homeland security council, devising a national response plan for domestic events and helping to compile a report on lessons from the bungled federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. A bipartisan group of former homeland security officials endorsed her nomination, including two former secretaries of the department, Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, both Republicans who served under Mr. Bush. “Ms. Nielsen has been engaged in counterterrorism, all-hazard risk mitigation, critical infrastructure protection and response policy from the earliest days of what we now know as homeland security,” they jointly wrote in a letter to the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month.

Jennings Brown,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is finally testing the new U.S. presidential alert system after the initial test was delayed for nearly two weeks. The alert is planned to go out to approximately 225 million compatible phones across the U.S. on Wednesday at 2:18 pm ET. The message should read: THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed. The alert is expected to appear and sound similar to AMBER and severe weather alerts. But unlike those notices, theres currently not a clear way to opt out of presidential alerts on smartphones. Navigating to your phones notification settings and turning off Emergency Alerts could do the trick, but if you want any guarantee that you wont hear this alert, youll probably just have to turn off your phone entirely. At 2:20 pm, two minutes after the message is sent to cell phones, itll hit TVs and radios. The test was originally supposed to go out on September 20, but was delayed because FEMA was focused on its emergency response to Hurricane Florence. The system is being put in place so that the president can alert the majority of Americans of major emergencies and threats to public safety, like terrorism acts or natural disasters. Many fear that Trump will use the system to blast every phone with his angry rants about the Deep State, but that is unlikely as every message is supposed to go through FEMA and involves a complicated process of mass delivery. The system is very well governed and rooted in law in terms of its intended use, FEMAs public warning system director Antwane Johnson told the Wall Street Journal.

JOSE A. DEL REAL,"And there has also been a sharp decrease in the number of recent arrivals immigrants who entered the country within the last five years. There was an average of 386,000 annual unauthorized arrivals for the 2011-16 period, compared with 715,000 for the 2002-07 period. That amounts to a 46 percent decline, according to the report. During that time, entering the country grew more difficult and, throughout the recession, jobs in construction and other fields grew more scarce. But in contrast, the number of migrants from Central America living in the United States illegally rose somewhat between 2007 and 2016, amid increased violence and economic uncertainty in the Northern Triangle region. The overwhelming majority of undocumented immigrants have lived in the country for a decade or longer. The typical undocumented migrant living in the United States in 2016 had been here for about 15 years, up from a median of about nine years in 2007. Two-thirds of all undocumented immigrants, the researchers found, had lived in the United States for more than 10 years. This is a much more rooted, established population than it was in 2007, Ms. Cohn said. There are markedly fewer short-term residents and more long term residents. One million immigrants without papers are protected from deportation by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and other mechanisms. Pew estimates that about 700,000 people in the United States who were brought to the country without documents as children have received protection from deportation through DACA. An additional 300,000 have Temporary Protected Status, which is applied to migrants from countries like El Salvador and Haiti that have experienced natural disasters.","Immigrants were apprehended by law enforcement agents in Laredo, Tex., in August.

"Ari Phillips on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","It’s been less than two months since mudslides tore through Southern California’s Santa Barbara County, killing 21 people and destroying at least 100 homes. Now, Montecito and Carpinteria, small coastal towns that suffered the bulk of that devastation, are under new evacuation orders as a strong rains are forecast. As of 8 a.m. Wednesday morning, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office has issued a Recommended Evacuation Warning for areas in the country that were recently hit by the Thomas, Sherpa, and Whittier wildfires. The burned areas clear a path for rocks and debris that otherwise would have probably have been contained during a flash flood. According to the warming, a winter storm arriving Thursday night and continuing through Friday could drop one-third to two-thirds of an inch of rain per hour. The National Weather Service informed officials that this heavy rainfall may be enough to trigger mud and debris flows near burn areas, according to KEYT news. Tree roots are also crucial in holding soil together along steep topography, and with that natural support removed, the land becomes much more susceptible to mudslides. This is especially the case in drought-ravaged regions where the soil is too dry to take in large amounts of water very quickly. This interactive map identifies the areas of Goleta, Santa Barbara, Montecito, Summerland and Carpinteria most threatened by the rains. Kathy Hoxsie, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard, told the Los Angeles Times that the “very moist system...goes right over” the Thomas Fire burn scar. The Thomas Fire, which ignited in early December, eventually became the state’s largest wildfire on record, burning about 281,900 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. Many were also forced to evacuate when the Thomas Fire threatened the region. The back-to-back natural disasters have forced local officials to reconsider how they warn residents about threats and how to distinguish between voluntary and mandatory evacuation zones. “The problem is, sometimes the focus is on the word ‘voluntary,’ rather than the word ‘evacuation,’”Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown recently told The Washington Post. “The reality is, it’s still an evacuation area...Had we known what we now know, we would have evacuated the entire area.” Additional evacuation information will be provided later on Wednesday and if any Mandatory Evacuation Order is issued, everyone must least the designated areas by Thursday, March 1 at 9 a.m. “If at any time people feel threatened, take immediate action,” states the release. “Do not wait for a notification. Those with access and functional needs and those with large animals should leave.” When evacuated Montecito residents started returning to their homes in early February after the devastating January mudslides, they were met with a host of new problems, including unhealthy layers of mud containing everything from sewage to petrochemicals, according to local reports. And now, another decision about evacuation.","It’s been less than two months since mudslides tore through Southern California’s Santa Barbara County, killing 21 people and destroying at least 100 homes.

Video creators like Strictoaster and Fluxtrance have carved out a space on the platform for themselves by recording the process of building beautiful cities, landscapes, or strange architectural feats in Skylines, speeding the recordings up, and then talking through their process. Donoteat, who humorously self-describes as a “disgusting neckbearded STEMlord with a degree in civil engineering,” counts himself as a socialist, and whose real name is Justin Roczniak, saw these kinds of Skylines videos and decided to do something different. “Talking about the game itself or how you modded it to achieve the visuals you wanted is all well and good,” he wrote in an email exchange with Kotaku, “but I thought maybe it would be more interesting to talk about how cities actually work while doing the video rather than just talk about how I’m painting a pretty picture.” Roczniak’s main Skylines series is centered on a city named Franklin. The videos are unflinching looks at how American history and politics have created its cities. The series approaches cities from a historical angle, beginning with the time before colonization in North America and then slowly building period-to-period from there. There is no blank slate from which cities emerge, the videos argue, but instead they are founded through mass displacement and control. The early videos are dominated by discussions of trade and mercantile systems because Roczniak is plainly claiming that thinking the American city without taking those things seriously means that you’re not really addressing what cities are. Franklin exists as a kind of allegory for real cities, not being based on any one in particular, but the things that happen in and around the city of Franklin are all based on the history of city development. The design decisions we see Roczniak making when he is plopping down water features, roads, or houses are grounded in decisions that have been made in real-world cities. He’s playing out the DNA of the modern urban area with a digital clone. For example, in a video dedicated to showing how urban freeways came to be built, Roczniak uses Skylines to explicitly show the human cost of the implementation of freeways through cities. He tells little fictional stories about apartments and storefronts before wiping them away to plop down a road. One of those is about Mohammed. Mohammed is a shopkeeper with a cat who dislikes belly rubs. He’s planning to buy the building he lives and works in. It is demolished to make room for a freeway, and his compensation is two years worth of rent. Roczniak narrates this fictional story with a complete deadpan voice, and it makes it all the more chilling. As he explains, stories like this have happened across the U.S. during the 20th century in cities like New York, Detroit, and Baltimore. “People’s lives are buried in abutments and pillar foundations,” he says solemnly. “Of course it turns out staying ‘apolitical’ with regard to history is impossible so I just let the leftist politics run wild rather than try to hold to some absurd standard of apoliticality.” That video is from “ Power, Politics, and Planning,” a side series that takes on broader issues than the Franklin series, but both are committed to showing the human cost of urban policy making. And when you watch Roczniak play it out, you really get a sense of what those costs are. After all, cities don’t just appear. They are built at the intersection of many different complex systems that are often elided or ignored in city building video games. Roczniak specifically mentioned Paulo Pedercini’s keynote at the International City-Gaming Conference from 2017 as a way of starting to think about his Cities: Skylines videos. As Roczniak explained, in city builder games “there’s no towns or villages on the map, no indigenous populations that you kick out to build your 50th MegaCity 2000” and there’s “no simulation of social, racial, or economic issues beyond a city budget.” Without these elements, Roczniak suggests, you’re not really simulating much at all when it comes to cities. It means that telling a truer story requires some narrative work. As Roczniak noted, “I tried to do a series where we compensate for that by telling a story, and that story has to start in the pre-colonial era so folks realize just how much of a civilization was there before, and how we kicked the indigenous population out to build our cities. And then as we go along we’ll see more plenty more cycles of people being kicked out to make room for more people or more development, and see how people grow rich or poor from economic circumstances beyond their control, and conflicts between labor and management, between different races, between different genders, and so on and so forth, and all the really messy stuff that goes on to build a city.” Roczniak is quick to point out the historical injustices between bosses and employees or slave owners and slaves and to track those injustices into our contemporary period. In one video, he explicitly calls to abolish ICE while explaining how the organization is an outgrowth of some of the systems of power that were developed during mercantilism. The connections between now and then are significant. When asked why he takes a specifically political angle with his YouTube videos, Roczniak explained that the Franklin series was originally intended to merely be historical and not necessarily political. “Of course it turns out staying ‘apolitical’ with regard to history is impossible so I just let the leftist politics run wild rather than try to hold to some absurd standard of apoliticality,” he noted. Letting the politics run wild allows Roczniak to delve deep into the relationship between historical facts and the cities that are created in the wake of that history. In his episode on the creation of the water system in the fictional Franklin, he lays out all of the wonderful and positive effects of water distribution before historically grounding how water was explicitly classed. The working class was too poor to get access to water or experience any cultural changes that came along with running water. He also uses this as a way of seamlessly move into a discussion of water resource management and the different uses for dams and reservoirs in our historical moment. Storing water for wildfire control is not one of those, Roczniak explains while showing a tweet from the President. Immediately afterward, he shows a tweet from the California Department of Corrections that demonstrates that “youth offenders” are being used as volunteer firefighters in that state. With deep sarcasm in his voice, Roczniak states that “effective wildfire fighting requires more conventional means, like child prison labor.” At every moment, Roczniak is stressing that the history that he is modeling in his Skylines builds, in this case water management, is directly attached to what is happening right now in American politics. He’s showing that the vast infrastructural moves that have been made to historically support our urbanization techniques over the past few centuries have come at extreme costs in human life and happiness. From that perspective, from ICE to water management, it doesn’t seem like anyone can have a neutral perspective when it comes to the policies and organizations that operate in and around America’s urban centers. “I want rent control, goddammit.” When asked if he considered himself a “leftist YouTuber,” Roczniak cedes that he might be at this point, but that he thinks of his videos at doing something slightly different than other leftists on the platform. “I don’t think, like, Contrapoints is gonna come out with a 30 minute leftist analysis of Amtrak,” he explained. “What I really want to do is provide a different take on how we view cities and what cities are capable of.” Post Capitalism by Colestia is a short city-building and puzzle game about finding the weak links… Read more Read During the email exchange with Kotaku, Roczniak made an impassioned case for why this all matters. For him, the actual implementation of design philosophies like New Urbanism in current cities have produced novelty but not substantive change. In his own words: “This mode of thinking around urban policy has bred a lot of mediocrity. Like building a tourist streetcar without dedicated lanes instead of a subway. Or a means-tested tax credit for renters instead of rent control. Or waiting for a hypothetical privately-funded magic vacuum train instead of actually investing in high-speed rail we could have built 40 years ago. These mediocre ideas shouldn’t be the limits; we can do better. I want a Philadelphia with more than 3 subway lines. I want to see a public housing scheme that actually drives home prices down. I want more trains going to more places. I want rent control, goddammit. So I’m making a series that shows how this is possible, why it hasn’t happened, and why it’s desirable.” Roczniak’s video output is certainly unique both in the Skylines YouTube community and on YouTube in general. The platform has a notable contingency of right-wing content producers, and it is refreshing to see a creator in the video game space that is working to explain leftist issues through accessible video game build videos. When asked if he had any must-read texts or websites for people who find his show interesting, Roczniak said to join the“New Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens” group on Facebook. As for other materials, Roczniak recommended Robert Caro’s The Power Broker and the same author’s Lyndon Johnson series for people who are interested in learning more about the concepts deployed in his videos. Then “go online and take a poke through your city’s zoning code, and understand what the restrictions actually mean. Try to figure out and understand the reasons why things are built the way they are built, and the politics behind the reasons.” This seems to be the real change that Roczniak is after. Cities: Skylines videos are just a pathway to get there.","You can do a lot of things with city builder games. You can replicate real cities, or you can simulate massive natural disasters.

"USA TODAY, Ben Tobin, USA TODAY","From small children to teens, Jennifer Jolly has all the tech toys to gift your children this holiday season
 JENNIFER JOLLY, FOR USA TODAY

Erie Jackson received ""by far the coolest toy"" for Christmas when he was a kid: a toy truck that would follow directions drawn on it.
But Jackson, now 21 and a student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, wouldn't have unwrapped that gift without the help of one program: Toys for Tots.
""They gave us amazing toys for Christmas when I was a child,"" Jackson said. ""We couldnt afford to get good things or even have a Christmas.
Run by the United States Marine Corps Reserve, Toys for Tots has delivered holiday gifts nationwide to less fortunate children since 1947. But this year, the program faced unique challenges with the fall of one of its largest retail partners, Toys R Us, and multiple natural disasters across the country.
The program knew it needed to brainstorm alternative solutions it if was to fulfill its mission of distributing gifts to those in need, said Lt. Gen. Pete Osman, president and CEO for the Marine Toys for Tots Foundation.
The generosity of the American public, and the great support we get from our corporate sponsors, have enabled us to push forward,"" Osman said.
Pushing through without Toys R Us
For the past 14 years, Toys R Us served as Toys for Tots' top corporate sponsor, raising about $8 million each year in donations and gifts. When Toys R Us closed all its stores in June, Toys for Tots needed to find alternative fundraising sources.
""Trying to fill that void is a real challenge,"" Osman said.
The organization reached out to other corporate sponsors, such as Disney and Hasbro, to increase donations. Some responded to the call: Toy company Funk doubled its donation of toys for a total contribution of more than $7 million this year, Toys for Tots said. 
Additionally, Toys for Tots has focused on increasing individual donations, Osman said.
""There are lots of businesses which have donation bins, but one of the issues is getting out the message that people can come and donate,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy Global Data. Toys for Tots has ""done some work with radio to spread the message, and that should help boost donations.""
Toys R Us was Toys for Tots's top corporate sponsor for 14 years.

The Toys R Us absence has also been felt at the local level. 
Deborah Oberlin, 49, a Toys for Tots coordinator from Carroll County, Ohio, oversees 10 counties in the state. She said one county in particular  Belmont  had benefited from ""one of the best Toys R Us ever."" 
Its closure ""definitely opened up a little wound that were trying to put a band aid on as quickly as we can, she said.
Individual donations and support from various companies particularly from the oil and gas industry, Oberlin said have played a major role in helping to close the gap. With the aid, about 6,000 families in Ohio will receive gifts this year, she said.
Its an amazing organization, and its run like a well-oiled ship, she said.
Charity in the face of natural disasters 
When Faith Martinez turned 7 years old in 2012, she asked for a unique birthday gift: donations to Toys for Tots. 
""I realized that there were kids out there that dont have a lot, and I get a lot for Christmas,"" she said. ""With my birthday so close to Christmas, theres no point in me getting extra gifts.
Martinez, who lives in Santa Clara, Calif., has been raising gifts for Toys for Tots since. In the wake of the California wildfire, which destroyed thousands of homes in November, Martinez received more donations than ever before when she turned 13 on Dec. 8.

Every time someone gave me one I was like it was so many, so many,"" Martinez said. ""At least every person gave like three gifts.
On the other side of the country, Hurricanes Michael and Florence rocked the Gulf and East Coasts, respectively. Osman said the disasters nationwide posed significant challenges, as many of the resources in affected towns went toward necessities, such as food and shelter. But individuals still stepped up to help Toys for Tots in the face of these tragedies, Osman said.
When they realize a disaster has happened, and people really need help, they rally to the cause,"" he said.
Making children's days in the holiday season
Tacshekia Duncan received gifts this year for her children through Childrens Friend, a child-serving nonprofit agency in Rhode Island that got some gifts through a local Toys for Tots drive held at area Cardi's Furniture stores.
Duncan, 35, from Pawtucket, Rhode Island, who plans to go back to school in January to pursue education in nursing, said she was ""wowed"" by the gifts her children received  which included dolls and teddy bears.
Just seeing the smiles that my children get from seeing these gifts Im so grateful, Duncan said.
Despite the challenges this year, Osman said he hopes Toys for Tots will give out 18 to 20 million toys to about 7.5 million less fortunate children by the end of the holiday season, about the same as in recent years.
Were optimistic that when the sun sets and the campaign is over with, were going to have done about the best we can,"" Osman said.

FRANCES ROBLES,"Mr. Ramos faced a skeptical Senate hearing on Tuesday. He told lawmakers that there had been no kickbacks, but acknowledged that the company had long been rife with political patronage, where up to half the employees got their job from an important connection. Mr. Ramos has given various contradictory explanations for why he chose Whitefish over mutual aid agreements with other utility companies, which are customary after disasters. He told The New York Times last month that he preferred Whitefish because he expected the United States Army Corps of Engineers to pay the company, which meant the bankrupt utility would not have to front any of the money for repairs. Under mutual aid agreements, Prepa would have to pay for the work and then seek reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But Mr. Ramos told legislators on Tuesday that he went with the private contractors because he did not have the resources to find lodging for workers borrowed from other utilities, even though emails released this week by the House Committee on Natural Resources show that Whitefish could not find housing, either. It has been a rough week for Mr. Ramos. On Monday, The New York Times reported that some of the subcontractors Whitefish had hired to do the work — people Prepa could have hired itself — were earning just $42 an hour. At the Senate hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Ramos fended off accusations of price gouging. On Wednesday, Mr. Ramos and the governor proudly hailed an important milestone: The company had finally reached 50 percent of its power capacity. Minutes later, a key line failed, again plunging the northern half of the island into darkness. Another line failed on Thursday. Some 58 days after the storm, the grid is generating power at 45 percent of capacity. On Friday, a local newspaper reported that Mr. Ramos had hired a friend who was once implicated in a federal criminal case to help advise the company. Mr. Ramos posted a cheerful technical update in a video on Facebook in which he defended the new hire, whom he described as an experienced electrical engineer. Mr. Ramos quit 20 minutes later.

"USA TODAY, Joel Shannon, USA TODAY","The restaurant that never closes, closed their location in Panama City Beach, Florida in preparation for Hurricane Michael. The 24-hour restaurant chain is known for staying open during natural disasters. RYAN KRUGER, 11ALIVE A day after the most powerful hurricane on record to hit Florida's Panhandle made landfall, a Waffle House location in Panama City Beach reopened to the public (Photo: Photo courtesy Pat Warner, Waffle House) A day after the most powerful hurricane on record to hit Florida's Panhandle made landfall, estimates said that more than 1 million people were without power, but some closed Waffle House locations had already begun to reopen. Although the chain is known for staying open during some of the worst natural disasters, the threat of Hurricane Michael managed to shut down 30 restaurants, a Waffle House representative said Wednesday evening. On Thursday, several locations had reopened. Waffle House spokesman Pat Warner told USA TODAY that the number of closed locations had decreased to 19 on Thursday night, with 15 Florida locations and four Georgia restaurants closed. Among the reopened locations: Two in Panama City Beach. That's particularly striking as that area was devastated by the storm. A separate Waffle House location in Panama City sustained significant damage, according to local media reports. Previously reported: Hurricane Michael is so bad that Waffle House has closed 30 restaurants More: Striking photos and video from Michael's path of destruction A billboard fell on that location, WJAX-TV reported. Video from the scene showed dangling light fixtures, shattered windows and debris strewn throughout the restaurant. Michael smashed into the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph at landfall just two miles shy of a Category 5. The Waffle House Storm Center, a team that mobilizes during extreme weather, has been monitoring the storm's path since Monday. Waffle House restaurants rarely close, often providing food and resources to first responders during natural disasters. Ashley May contributed to this story.

Kirsten Korosec,"Google’s annual Year in Search is more than a digital record of the events, stories and phenomena that captured our attention over 12 months. It’s a reckoning, or computation, on what mattered to society in any given year and sometimes even signal where it’s headed. And 2018 showed a world transfixed on one sporting event, one wedding, celebrity deaths, natural disasters and politics. In 2018, the global community was locked in on the World Cup. The final match was between France and Croatia; we’ll let you Google who won. The world was also transfixed on high-profile deaths of musicians, scientists and artists. Seven of the 10 top Google searches globally were of people who died in 2018, including theoretical physicist and author Stephen Hawking, rapper Mac Miller, the DJ Avicii, comic book creator and icon Stan Lee, celebrity chef, author and TV personality Anthony Bourdain, and fashion designer Kate Spade. One movie, Black Panther, made the top 10 global list, as well Meghan Markle, the former actress who became Duchess of Sussex when she married Prince Henry. In the U.S., the top overall searches followed a similar pattern, with a few other disruptive moments thrown in the mix, including the elections results, Hurricane Florence and Mega Millions results. A scan of other search categories that Google tracked reveals that U.S. users were obsessed with eyelashes in 2018, 1980s fashion, how to vote and how to register to vote, Unicorn cake and the Keto diet. Our top news search in the U.S. was led by the World Cup, followed by Hurricane Florence, Mega Millions, election results and Hurricane Michael. The Kavanaugh confirmation was the sixth most searched news story in 2018. The Florida shooting, the Royal Wedding, Olympic medal count and government shutdown rounded out the top 10 news searches in the U.S., according to Google. One of the more insightful metrics that Google tracks is the “What is ___ ?” list. In the U.S., people typing in that “what is” question into Google search asked most often about Bitcoin, racketeering, DACA (the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), government shutdown and Good Friday. U.S. Google users also wanted explanations for Fortnite, the “Yanny or Laurel” auditory illusion and what a nationalist is. Speaking of Fortnite, it was the most searched video game, according to Google’s annual Year in Search. The video game Fortnite was also the most searched GIF followed by “Default Dance,” “Dilly Dilly” and “Orange Justice” and “Black Panther.” Other top searched video games included Red Dead Redemption 2, Fallout 76, Far Cry 5 and God of War.

George Dvorsky,"Summer is finally upon us, which means it’s time to put together a reading list, whether it’s for the beach, your cottage, or the hammock in your backyard. Here are 15 science and technology books that will keep your nerdy brains engaged and titillated. The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World, by Steve Brusatte Paleontologist Steve Brusatte pieced together some of the most recent scientific findings to create this up-to-date story of the dinosaurs, from their humble beginnings during the Triassic, to their dramatic rise during the thundering Jurassic, and ending with their cataclysmic demise at the end of the Cretaceous. Filled with vivid illustrations, historical accounts, and tales of paleontological expeditions, this book will change the way you think about dinosaurs. Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, by Max Tegmark Artificial intelligence is poised to change nearly every facet of human life, from the way we do business and fight crime through to advances in self-driving vehicles and medicine. Life 3.0 tackles these and many other subjects, exploring the many ways in which our future, and humanity itself, could be molded by the powers of AI—for better and for worse. Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray, by Sabine Hossenfelder Physics is great, except when it isn’t. As author Sabine Hossenfelder points out in this highly readable book (you don’t need to be good at math or physics to enjoy and appreciate it), the notion that the best theories in physics are the most beautiful ones has led scientists down a dark path. Physics is now stuck in a rut, argues Hossenfelder, requiring scientists to re-construct their theories. The Space Barons: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the Cosmo s, by Christian Davenport We’re in the midst of new space race, but instead of rival countries battling for technological supremacy, the struggle has turned to the private sector. Washington Post staff writer Christian Davenport’s new book explores some of the key characters involved in the commercialization of space—the so-called Space Barons who are spending literally billions of dollars to push the industry—and their own personal, ego-driven agendas forward. Technically Wrong: Sexist Apps, Biased Algorithms, And Other Threats of Toxic Tech, by Sara Wachter-Boettcher If you’re in the mood to get angry at the tech industry this summer, then this is the perfect book for you. In Technically Wrong, Sara Wachter-Boettcher does a deep dive into the world of app and algorithm development, explaining why so many of the digital products we use today are so deeply and fundamentally flawed—and even harmful. What Is Real? The Unfinished Quest for the Meaning of Quantum Physics, by Adam Becker Physicist Richard Feynman once said, “If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don’t understand quantum mechanics.” Indeed, fewer things are as bizarre and spooky as the quantum realm, leading to all sorts of wacky ideas. Adam Becker’s new book, What Is Real, cuts through the confusion, providing a vivid account of this often arcane field, its history, and its numerous controversies. Robot Ethics 2.0: From Autonomous Cars to Artificial Intelligence, by Patrick Lin, Ryan Jenkins, and Keith Abney The classic Trolley Problem, as this updated compendium on robot ethics demonstrates, is child’s play compared to what’s coming. Advances in AI and robotics are arriving at a steady pace, exposing us to new risks, whether it be from self-driving cars, autonomous drones, or a robotic killing machine. This book of essays tackles many of the issues involved, from moral and legal responsibilities through to issues of trust, love, sex, and war. War Stuff: The Struggle for Human and Environmental Resources in the American Civil War, by Joan E. Cashin So much has been written and said about the U.S. Civil War, but as this new book by Joan Cashin makes clear, this 19th-century conflict still has some stories to tell. Combining military history, sociology, environmentalism, and gender studies, War Stuff reveals the disturbing extent to which both the North and South exploited the civilian population and the American land to fight the Civil War. Enlightenment Now: The Case For Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progres s, by Steven Pinker Love him or hate him, neuroscientist Steven Pinker is never not interesting. In this current era of cynicism and despair, Pinker dares to suggest that things are, slowly but surely, getting better—and that we have Enlightenment and humanist values to thank. Hard to resist a book that Microsoft founder Bill Gates has described as “my new favorite book of all time.” The Equations of Life: How Physics Shapes Evolution, by Charles S. Cockell Across the vastness of the Universe, the laws of physics remain the same. This inalienable aspect of the cosmos, argues Charle Cockell in The Equations of Life, means the processes of biology and evolution are constrained by what these law permit. Life as we know it here on Earth, therefore, is very similar to how it will appear elsewhere, whether on Mars or the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn, or even further beyond. What the Future Looks Like: Scientists Predict the Next Great Discoveries―and Reveal How Today’s Breakthroughs Are Already Shaping Our World, by Jim Al-Khalili Genomics, robotics, AI, the Internet of Things, synthetic biology, interstellar travel, the colonization of the solar system—these are a few of our favorite things. In What the Future Looks Like, British theoretical physicist Jim Al-Khalili rounds up a team of experts to discuss these topics and their impact on the future. The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters Have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them), by Lucy Jones Earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, and volcanoes—these are not a few of our favorite things. In The Big Ones, renowned seismologist Lucy Jones takes a look at the history of natural disasters, their impact on our culture, and new ways of thinking about the natural catastrophes in our future. Superminds: The Surprising Power of People and Computers Thinking Together, by Thomas W. Malone Computers are amazing. So are humans. But both are subject to extreme limitations. Put them together, says author Thomas Malone in Superminds, and you can create some incredible things. Indeed, as we venture into a world infused with AI, the true power of our technologies will only emerge once humans and computers are allowed to collaborate. Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece, by Michael Benson This isn’t, strictly speaking, a book about science or technology, but I’m sure Gizmodo and io9 readers will find it interesting. In celebration of the 50th anniversary of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Michael Benson looks back on how the film was made, including inside accounts of how director Stanley Kubrick and author Arthur C. Clarke worked to create one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Wilding: The Return of Nature to a British Farm, by Isabella Tree This is the story of the Knepp Experiment, a pioneering rewilding project in West Sussex, United Kingdom, in which free-roaming grazing animals were used to create new habitats for wildlife. In Wilding, Isabella Tree shows what happens when people take a step back and allow nature to take over. BONUS: A Brief History of Time, by Stephen Hawking What better way to remember the late, great Stephen Hawking than to read his classic book, A Brief History of Time. Written in 1988 and updated in 1998, this classic sold more than 10 million copies in the first two decades after it was published. From the big bang and black holes through to wormholes and extra dimensions, the book stands the test of time, showcasing Hawking’s brilliance as a physicist and a communicator of science.","Summer is finally upon us, which means it’s time to put together a reading list, whether it’s for the beach, your cottage, or the hammock in your backyard.

Luke Dormehl,"A 3D-printed cement paste could one day be used to make buildings more resilient to natural disasters, claim researchers from Purdue University. Although it sounds paradoxical, the paste actually gets tougher the more it cracks. This makes it a potentially invaluable new building material. Cement-based materials such as concrete are brittle and crack as they deform, Reza Moini, a doctoral candidate in the Lyles School of Civil Engineering at Purdue, told Digital Trends. Using the findings of this work, we can produce structural elements for buildings and habitats that can resist dynamic loads such as impact, experienced during [an] earthquake, without failure. Jan Olek, a professor of civil engineering and another researcher on the project, noted that nature has to deal with weaknesses to survive, so the team is using the “built-in” weaknesses of cement-based materials to increase their toughness. They have done this by creating 3D-printed materials inspired by the properties found in arthropod shells, the shells belonging to animals such as lobsters and beetles. The biomechanical design of these shells allows them to take large amounts of punishment. Some patterns which the printed paste could be used to replicate include honeycomb patterns or printed filaments following a helicoidal pattern. “3D printing has removed the need for creating a mold for each type of design, so that we can achieve these unique properties of cement-based materials that were not possible before,” said Jeffrey Youngblood a professor of materials engineering at Purdue. This isnt the first time weve covered innovative or futuristic building materials. Other research projects in this vein have included spray-on cement able to help older buildings survive earthquakes, and a smart graphene coating which changes color to indicate breaks and fractures. There are several questions and opportunities that we still need to answer, Pablo Zavattieri told us. We still do not understand the role of the rheological properties of fresh cement paste — as it is being extruded through the 3D printer, and it is deposited and put at rest on top of the already printed structure. We also do not know the properties of the new architectured materials during the first hours and days, as the cement paste goes through [its solidification] process. This involves all kind of mechanisms at different length scales, such as shrinkage and drying. We are going to explore the role of controlling weak interfaces. A paper describing the work was recently published in the journal Advanced Materials.","A 3D-printed cement paste could one day be used to make buildings more resilient to natural disasters, claim researchers from Purdue University.

Christopher Carbone,"Imagine living in a sustainable city that not only produced its own food and energy but also withstood natural disasters — all while resting out on the ocean.
Although it sounds like something concocted by a science fiction writer, the United Nations wants to make it a reality.
During a roundtable discussion convened by the United Nations Human Settlement Program (UN Habitat) and a company called Oceanix that's seeking to build floating cities, a group of designers and architects unveiled a concept for a floating city that would be affordable and able to survive potential catastrophes caused by climate change.
BEYOND PAPER STRAWS: MORE HACKS FOR REDUCING PLASTIC AT HOME
(Oceanix)
""Everybody on the team actually wants to get this built,"" Marc Collins, the CEO of Oceanix, told Business Insider. ""We're not just theorizing.""
The executive director of UN Habitat, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, pledged the international agency's support for actually bringing the project to fruition.
""We must ensure that the benefits of technological advances are a basic right, not a privilege of the few. UN Habitat is ready to provide the platform so that we can engage the best minds in every part of the world,"" she said in a statement.
The floating cities, designed by world-renowned architect Bjarke Ingels in collaboration with Oceanix, would be a collection of hexagonal platforms that could each host about 300 residents. A group of six platforms would make up a village and the entire city could have six villages, for about 10,000 residents.
MELTING GLACIERS ON ALASKA'S DENALI WILL UNLEASH TONS OF HUMAN POOP
The villages, which would not have cars or trucks, would use aquaponic systems and vertical farming to grow enough food to feed residents year-round. The platforms would be anchored by something called Biorock, which is a very strong material (harder than concrete) created by exposing underwater minerals to electrical currents. The cities can be seen in a series of concept images.
Oceanix makes its case for the ocean-based cities, which technically would be anchored to the ocean floor, this way: ""As coastal cities struggle to cope with rapid population growth, many simply pour sand into the ocean to create new land. Unfettered coastal urbanization is destroying millions of hectares of the ocean and marine life; close to 50 percent of people in the world live in coastal areas. The rising sea and climate change are compounding the problem. ... We believe humanity can live in harmony with life below water. ""

Other roundtable participants said the technological benefits could also be applied to land-based cities.
“If we are able to create a closed-loop system for floating cities, they will become role models for cities around the world,” Suzy Amis Cameron, an environmental advocate, said.",Imagine living in a sustainable city that not only produced its own food and energy but also withstood natural disasters -- all while resting far out on the ocean.,2019-04-08T15:30:26Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}","This futuristic, floating city can withstand Category 5 hurricanes",https://www.foxnews.com/science/this-futuristic-floating-city-can-withstand-category-5-hurricanes,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/futurecity2_oceanix.jpg,fox-news,Fox News,Natural disasters,1

Sasha Lekach,"Before Hurricane Florence hit, Tesla gave its electric cars a boost by extending the range of their batteries to help people evacuate. Florence made landfall in North Carolina on Friday before being downgraded to a tropical storm. SEE ALSO: There's a glaring weakness in electric vehicles. (It's range anxiety.) As NPR reported, Tesla can remotely tap into the max capacity of its 75 kWh batteries in Model S and X vehicles, adding about 30 more miles of range. In any natural disaster situation like this, our policy is to make Superchargers free of use in order to optimize evacuation routes for affected customers https://t.co/SOUlKv3UUZ — Tesla (@Tesla) September 13, 2018 Tesla owners were notified that Tesla had enabled the additional battery capacity. They were also offered free Supercharging, which gets batteries to 80 percent in about 30 minutes. ""We hope that this gives you the peace of mind to get to a safe location,"" the notification read. Normal battery configurations will return mid-October. Tesla also extended battery range last year during Hurricane Irma. On GM vehicles from Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac, all OnStar members have access to Crisis Assist services during disasters like Florence even if they don't usually subscribe. That means people can use their cars to navigate out of disaster zones, find hotels, gas, or use their vehicles as a WiFi hotspot. Mary Ann Adams, disaster response and crisis incident manager for OnStar, said in a phone call Friday that 25,000 calls had come in since Tuesday through the Crisis Assist service to always-available response teams. ""Since cars are connected they provide connections they may not have,"" she said about people in the storm zone. For many the OnStar tools mean access to a working phone and a charging source. For others it's a way to find a hotel or the latest storm updates. ""I think of it as another tool to survive the storm and navigate the storm,"" she said. After a storm, calls tick up again as damage is assessed and further evacuations may be required. For some it's a matter of checking to see if they can return home. If they can, signage and roads may be destroyed, prompting more calls to the command center. As of Friday afternoon, according to the New York Times, four deaths have been linked to the storm. It's supposed to move southwest into South Carolina before heading north.","Before Hurricane Florence hit, Tesla gave its electric cars a boost by extending the range of their batteries to help people evacuate.

Seth Borenstein / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — With three strong hurricanes, wildfires, hail, flooding, tornadoes and drought, the United States tallied a record high bill last year for weather disasters: $306 billion. The U.S. had 16 disasters last year with damage exceeding a billion dollars, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. That ties 2011 for the number of billion-dollar disasters, but the total cost blew past the previous record of $215 billion in 2005. Costs are adjusted for inflation and NOAA keeps track of billion-dollar weather disasters going back to 1980. Three of the five most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history hit last year. Hurricane Harvey cost $125 billion, second only to 2005’s Katrina, while Maria cost $90 billion, ranking third, NOAA said. Irma was $50 billion, for the fifth most expensive hurricane. Western wildfires fanned by heat racked up $18 billion in damage, triple the previous U.S. wildfire record, according to NOAA. “While we have to be careful about knee-jerk cause-effect discussions, the National Academy of Science and recent peer-reviewed literature continue to show that some of today’s extremes have climate change fingerprints on them,” said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society. NOAA announced its figures at the society’s annual conference in Austin, Texas. The weather agency also said that 2017 was the third hottest year in U.S. records for the Lower 48 states with an annual temperature of 54.6 degrees (12.6 degrees Celsius) — 2.6 degrees warmer than the 20th century average. Only 2012 and 2016 were warmer. The five warmest years for the Lower 48 states have all happened since 2006. This was the third straight year that all 50 states had above average temperatures for the year. Five states — Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and New Mexico — had their warmest year ever.

Rayne Ellis,"The extreme winds from last year's destructive hurricane season seems to have come with some unexpected consequences. Hurricanes Irma and Maria — some of the most destructive in Caribbean history — may have forced rapid evolutionary change in a native population of small-bodied anole lizards (Anolis scriptus), researchers in the West Indies say. SEE ALSO: Hurricanes are slowing down. Here's why that's very bad news for everyone. According to a new study about the lizards released in Nature this week, much of the surviving population of lizards after the hurricanes have larger toe pads, longer forelimbs, and shorter hind limbs than the average anole. Still of lizard clinging to an experimental perch in hurricane-force winds. Wind speed meter is displaying in miles per hour.Credit: Colin Donihue Image: Colin donihue Those long forelimbs and toe pads would have allowed these anoles to cling to surfaces during gale-force winds brought by the hurricanes. Effectively, this means that the hurricanes forced natural selection in real-time, the scientists suggest. “Day in and day out, natural selection favors those lizards who can run around branches, find food, and find mates,” lead author of the study Colin Donihue said in an interview. “It’s only in these atypical instances like hurricanes that we would be able to see a shift away from historical selection.” With the frequency and intensity of hurricanes ramping up, species within affected ecosystems are being forced to adapt to extreme conditions. It's even possible that certain adaptations might aid survival chances in one instance, and hurt them in another, Martha Muñoz, an evolutionary biologist not affiliated with the study, said. ""One trait can enable survivorship in a storm, like shorter hind limbs, but on a daily basis longer hind limbs will help these animals escape predation because it helps them run faster,"" Muñoz said. But it would take an entirely different study to determine how this selection affects the future of the species, and findings like this are rare. In fact, the data from Donihue and colleagues was due to a coincidence. They had just completed a survey of the lizard population immediately before the hurricanes swept through the island. After the hurricanes, they recognized that they had a unique opportunity, and decided to return. The hurricanes key to their research, Irma and Maria, have gone down as two of the worst natural disasters to affect the Caribbean — where it's possible that almost 5,000 people have lost their lives. And a year later, some places affected, like Puerto Rico and Dominica, still don't have power. The literature on the impact of extreme weather events on localized animal populations is a relatively scarce, but burgeoning field due to increased extreme weather. A study published in 2017 found that a polar vortex that hit the Southeast in 2014 drove selection in a population of green anole lizard. The NOAA's GOES-East satellite captured the 2014 polar vortex hovering over the United State's southeast. Image: NASA The researchers behind that study were able to survey the population of lizards before and after the weather event, and found that the surviving population of lizards had many of the genetic qualities in northern populations of the same species. For example, the surviving lizards had an abnormally high tolerance for cold weather in that region. Aside from these two studies, there isn’t much known about how fast-acting extreme weather events change animal populations on a large scale. But with extreme weather events becoming more and more common as human-caused climate change continues, it’s likely that the common agents of natural selection will shift toward those which influence survival during these catastrophes. “The key to this study is understanding that natural selection is on-going and is constantly in the background,” Donihue said The next step? Muñoz suggests going back to the island a year later and measuring the new generation of lizards to see if this natural selection has truly translated into evolution.",The extreme winds from last year's destructive hurricane season seems to have come with some unexpected consequences.

"USA TODAY, The Editorial Board, USA TODAY","Hurricane Florence on Sept. 12, 2018, in this satellite image provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (Photo: NOAA via Getty Images) An alien intelligence visiting our planet this week would be shocked by how people can at once be fearful and feckless about the consequences of a warming planet. While there is no evidence that climate change creates any given storm — such as Hurricane Florence, ruthlessly bearing down on the East Coast — there is no scientific debate that the planet is warming and that seas are rising due in part to melting ice sheets. And there is reasonably strong scientific consensus that warmer air holds more water vapor, producing more rain, and that higher ocean temperatures fuel a cyclone's power. In addition, it's indisputable that rising sea levels worsen one crucial destructive element of any hurricane — the storm surge of sea water that sweeps inland wreaking havoc. Despite this growing body of knowledge, and even as Florence makes its terrifying debut, news arrived this week that the Trump administration is seeking to ease drilling-industry restrictions and allow even more heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. Even as the nation braces for what could be one of the most destructive manifestations of a warming planet — a hurricane of potentially historic proportions — policies are being drafted that could render the planet even more vulnerable. Isn't this the definition of insanity? The rule changes proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, first reported this week by The New York Times, would weaken Obama-era restrictions aimed at preventing oil- and gas-drilling operations from leaking methane, a pollutant 25 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. President Donald Trump has labeled climate change a hoax, and easing methane restrictions is his latest effort to dismantle President Barack Obama's framework for fighting climate change. After announcing that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, Trump has proposed rolling back vehicle fuel-efficiency standards and junking Obama's Clean Power Plan for cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generating plants. All of this is being done under the mantle of deregulation. Easing restrictions on the methane leaking into the atmosphere will save the oil and gas industry $484 million by 2025, according to an EPA estimate. But consider this: ►Three of the five costliest hurricanes in U.S. history were last year (Harvey, Irma and Maria) and caused a combined $265 billion in damage. ►Hurricanes Irma and Harvey represented the first time in 166 years of record-keeping that two Category 4 hurricanes made U.S. landfall in one year. ►Harvey dumped more than 60 inches in Texas, and two studies have determined that global warming hiked that rainfall by 15%-38%. Forecasters now fear that Florence could prove to be the Harvey of the East Coast. And there's the price in lives lost. Maria killed at least 3,000 people in Puerto Rico, earning it a place as America's second deadliest storm since a hurricane killed 8,000 to 12,000 people in Galveston, Texas, in 1900. Surveys this year show that three out of four Americans now believe that global warming is real, and large majorities agree that humans are either primarily or partially responsible with the burning of fossil fuels and the release of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. As the fury of Hurricane Florence descends on the southeastern USA, its ferocity juiced by warm waters and a warming atmosphere, Americans may begin questioning the wisdom of policies that can only make such catastrophes worse.

Abhishek Budholiya,"The past decade has seen hundreds of natural disasters in various countries. While the US stays one of the most affected ones, developing countries remain the major sufferers particularly due to denser population and poor evacuation infrastructure. Catastrophic events lead to massive destruction of property and incalculable loss of human and animal life, and handling the post-event adversity is an extremely challenging task that follows. Is IoT making an impact in efficient natural disaster preparedness? With adverse climate change becoming more of a concern for the entire world, experts continue to explore the use of the Internet of Things technology in addressing and optimizing the emergencies that arise as a result of natural calamities. Whether the occurrence includes earthquake, tsunami, wildfire, volcanic eruption, flood, hurricane, tornado, landslide, extreme weather conditions, or any geological process, the loss is often uncontrollable. However, we are fortunately in an era where the immense advancement in technology can help to reduce the intensity of immediate and eventual effects. To be precise, the Internet of Things technology has become sophisticated in no time – extending its practical application areas. Several researchers, scientists, and IoT experts from around the world have been taking efforts to deploy this smart technology in minimizing the destruction caused due to natural disasters. IoT, although cannot prevent any disaster from happening, can definitely aid in efficient disaster preparedness. It has been found to be useful in predicting the upcoming event and delivering an early warning to community through smart systems. Why is IoT a highly potential technology in disaster prediction and management? The very first application is, by default, to minimize and possibly prevent the risk of a natural catastrophic event. With the help of GIS, smart devices, and satellite communication, the IoT technology can be used to design the systems meant for early warning. Following this, awareness about the upcoming event is another important application. What could create awareness and offer quick guidelines about the preparedness better than social media? Conventional media also play a major role. Real-time communication in order to deliver an emergency response is the next potential application of IoT here. The most challenging and probably the most exhaustive job that follows any disastrous event is recovery and rescue. The IoT technology can be efficiently used in creating online systems that search missing people and even manage emergency funds. Moreover, IoT-enabled devices and systems can function as an alternative way for communication when the conventional infrastructure for communication is poor, sensitive, or not working. Though the latest innovations in IoT do not directly account for disaster preparedness, they do bring about excellent disaster resilience. However, deployment of IoT-enabled devices helps here in a totally different way. It does not help in disaster preparedness and resilience but enables a viable option to communicate in such circumstances, in form of limited or emergency communication. How do IoT sensors contribute in disaster preparedness? IoT sensors development is perceived to be an excellent innovation that poses itself as an efficient solution to the lack of foresight which intensifies the adversity of any natural disaster and the following emergency situation. This is exactly what the sensors concentrate on, by monitoring multiple climatic parameters. IoT sensors can be installed within a particular area to create a system that ultimately acts as an emergency unit in case of catastrophic events. Weather parameters, such as humidity, moisture, temperature, air quality, pressure, water level, and many more are constantly monitored by these sensors and the moment any one or more of them reach a dangerous level, the sensor network grasps it. Any other notification system could hardly match up the speed of sensors notification, when it comes to alerting emergency responders and message broadcasters. Moreover, sensors contribute to the available data that provides the real-time details about weather, possible ways of evacuation, traffic, medical services, and police. They in a nutshell anticipate the upcoming hazards well in advance so as to help decisions regarding the next plan of action. Sensors that are designed to predict flood situations through identification of possible critical hazards affecting infrastructure, have to be installed in a strategic manner. Flood depiction and management system can be complicated but if well planned and implemented, its versatility does an excellent job in flood-like events. Several IoT sensor network systems can efficiently function on an automated response solely on the basis of the real-time data absorbed by the sensors. In case of a forest fire, IoT sensors on trees monitor temperature, moisture, CO and CO2 levels. Local population is notified in advance and all the details are informed to firefighters even before they reach the location. Researchers are further working on specific IoT sensor types, including infrared and microwave. While the former one may have its application in flood prediction and management, the latter one is foreseen to be a valuable sensor in case of earthquakes.","<!-- Featured image --> <!-- /Featured image-->The past decade has seen hundreds of natural disasters in various countries.

Ben Paynter,"The nonprofit Direct Relief has traditionally been known for distributing things like medicines, vaccines, and equipment to areas hard hit by natural disasters or severe poverty. But in recent years it’s had to grow in new ways to keep pace with both the increased rate and severity of both natural disasters and inadequate access to decent healthcare among low-income and uninsured people. In 2018, it donated a record amount of both medical supplies but also a new kind of resource–direct funding–to support local health centers within the United States and more than 100 other countries.Last year, Direct Relief provided about $1.2 billion worth of wholesale materials to health centers and clinics alongside $23.5 million in cash to support those group’s own needs, such as staffing up in times of crisis, or, in the case of Puerto Rico, helping many facilities convert to a solar and battery backup microgrid, so they wouldn’t be knocked offline in the next major storm.
[Photo: Direct Relief]
For comparison, the group distributed a little under $945 million in supplies in 2017, along with $5.5 million in separate funding. Its materials are typically provided through charitable donations from health industry companies, and Direct Relief also accepts public donations.
“In all respects we ended the year bigger than it began,” says Thomas Tighe, CEO of Direct Relief. “That’s in large part to keep up with what we see as the clear trend of more frequent, larger-scale, and more intense natural disasters that put a lot of people into harm’s way, and the need to maintain support to areas of chronic need [with] deeply entrenched poverty.”

For instance, after Hurricane Florence struck the Carolinas, Direct Relief delivered 14,000 pounds of supplies, including 300,000 daily doses of medicine to health centers and clinics in those areas, according to a public report. When Hurricane Michael made landfall a few weeks later in Florida, it delivered more goods–but also $250,000 to help keep nearby facilities operating.

After Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, the organization rendered more than $70 million in supplies, but also $12 million for projects that included solar arrays with battery backups for 14 different service centers. “We did not anticipate two years ago leaning in so heavily to become a financier and project manager… but that’s what they needed,” Tighe says. After all, it’s difficult to ship refrigerated medicine to a place that has no reliable way to keep it cool.
In Butte Country, California, home of the deadly Camp Fire, it also helped firefighters buy more search and rescue equipment. And the organization is applying some lessons from field operations to its own home base too. In late 2018, the group added its own solar-powered and Tesla battery microgrid on a major warehouse in Santa Barbara, California to ensure operations stay running no matter what obstacles the surrounding area faces.
[Photo: Direct Relief]
The organization also helped establish and continues to stock field hospitals with aid supplies for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, and equip various pregnancy support centers with equipment and medicine to give impoverished mothers and newborns a better shot at staying healthy.
Tighe hopes the group will continue to ramp up its delivery of not just supplies but financial assistance when necessary, particularly for the U.S.’s vast network of nonprofit community health centers. “There’s this ongoing debate in the United States at least about how much we want the government to do, and how much we’re willing to pay in taxes to have it do it,” he says. “We’ve created a clearinghouse to gather and efficiently allocate medical material. We’re looking at becoming a clearinghouse to gather funds to provide financial assistance for places that can put it to very good immediate use in communities that need it.”","More and more, disaster relief agency Direct Relief is finding that just giving cash is an important part of helping communities recover.

SHERI FINK,"What seems like a small detail might resonate in unanticipated ways. For example, well into production on the Magazine story, the editor, Luke Mitchell, allowed me to add a sentence about innovations that included the fact that in Charleston County, S.C., people could provide information to 911 online.
I learned later that several 911 directors reached out to Charlestons 911 director for more information. One was John Dejung from Dane County, Wis. Hurricane Harvey had awakened him to the possibility that his 911 system, one of the largest in a state prone to ice storms, blizzards and tornadoes, might get so bogged down or debilitated that we might want to rely on alternatives to phones. Dane County set aside $10,000 in next years budget for the purchase of a system that will allow people to reach 911 online if necessary in a major disaster.
That alone would likely not have saved Caseys life, but it may save someones. There are myriad ways in which we and the infrastructure and systems we rely on remain unprepared to contend with the natural disasters that seem to arrive ever more frequently and catastrophically. 
All of us have a stake and arguably a role in fixing the most critical problems. But to justify making personal, professional or governmental investments, we need to understand what it looks like when we dont. Like Wayne, I want to trust that there is value in human empathy, in accountability, and in the practice, from time immemorial, of reconstructing our human tragedies in the form of narratives and sharing them.","Ronnie Dailey, then 10, wept while looking at the casket of his mother, Cassandra Dills-Dailey.

GAIA PIANIGIANI,"Mr. Salvini, who has increasingly depicted himself as Italys law-and-order strongman, lashed out at the growing opposition, saying the critics were disregarding the law.
Almost a million people have landed in Italy in recent years, Mr. Salvini said in a Facebook live video last Sunday. We need to be merciful to the five million Italians who live in poverty.
For traffickers of human beings and their accomplices, Italian ports were, are and will be closed, he said, slapping down his coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star movement, who had said that Italy was open to taking 10 women and children from the aid vessels once they had disembarked in Malta.
In his speech on Monday, the pope acknowledged the concerns in Europe and North America about migrants, but urged sympathy for them, saying governments should help those fleeing poverty, violence and natural disasters.
I do not believe that partial solutions can exist for so universal an issue, he said. Recent events have shown the need for a common, concerted response by all countries, without exception and with respect for every legitimate aspiration, whether of states or of migrants and refugees themselves.
Francis also nodded to the sex abuse crisis in the Roman Catholic Church that increasingly threatens to erode his authority and ability to speak out on global issues.
In February, the heads of some 110 bishops conferences are to gather in the Vatican. Francis said on Monday that the discussions would be held to shed full light on the facts and to alleviate the wounds caused by such crimes.","In a speech to diplomats in the Vatican on Monday, Pope Francis urged Europeans to remain united in the face of “temptation to erect new curtains.”",2019-01-07T16:57:31Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Pope Francis Denounces the Rise of Nationalism,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/world/europe/francis-nationalism-immigration.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/08/world/08Italy/08Italy-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1

ALAN BLINDER and CHRIS DIXON,"The toughest part is waking up, Ms. Ballew said at a shelter where 17 people slept on Tuesday night. You get maybe a couple of hours of sleep, and then you wake up, and you cry again. The days away from normal life start to run together. There may be fleeting moments of relief: Cheerleaders and basketball players from U.N.C. have paid morale-boosting visits to the shelter where the Brewingtons are staying. But the hours and days are more often clouded by daunting choices about how to live among strangers. Christina Palozzolo, who evacuated from a three-bedroom house in Conway last week, said she and her partner, David Andrew Bell, were grateful for the food, support and air-conditioning they found at a recreation center-turned-shelter. But she has spent many hours feeling lonely and uncomfortable, especially when Mr. Bell is at work at a beverage bottling warehouse. Unsettling as the situation is, she said she drew some comfort from the fact that her children have been able to stay with their grandmother, squeezed into her tiny apartment (one child sleeps in a closet), rather than at the shelter. They wish they could be with us, but its a lot of work to have kids in a place like this, to keep them under control and have the people here not get mad and upset at them, Ms. Palozzolo said. South Carolinas river flooding is expected to last through the week in some areas, extending the need for shelter beds there. But in North Carolina, where the shelter census stood at some 20,000 people at the height of the crisis, federal and state officials, as well as nonprofit groups like the Red Cross, expect to close shelters more quickly, as evacuees return home or receive disaster assistance. Officials said it was likely that some of the people still in the shelters were homeless before the storm. Mental health experts say that a shelter stay of a week or two might not do evacuees any lasting harm, but that being displaced from their homes for lengthy periods could leave them with increased unease about school, work, personal relationships and economic well-being. What we know is that when people are displaced, anxiety and stress is much higher, said Dr. Robin Gurwitch, a psychologist and professor at Duke University School of Medicine, where she researches the consequences of trauma and natural disasters on children and families. The longer it takes for the routines and normalcy and getting back to what I used to be doing, the more at risk families are, Dr. Gurwitch said.","The storm’s prodigious rainfall continues to swell rivers in the Carolinas, leaving evacuees stuck in shelters and driving more people from their homes.",2018-09-26T22:14:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Florence’s Slow-Motion Havoc Leaves Thousands of Evacuees in Limbo,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/us/flooding-carolinas-florence-evacuees.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/us/27flooding1/merlin_144323952_c701fabb-fe2c-492a-80c6-74dda856442d-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1

After 9/11, my dad filled a duffel bag with some energy bars, a couple gallons of water, some penicillin, and a map. Amid scaremongering headlines about imminent anthrax and “dirty bomb” attacks in the city, he wanted to have some supplies on hand in case we needed to get out of Brooklyn fast. Were he to assemble such a bag today, he’d likely stumble on a number of companies promising a more wholesale brand of disaster preparedness: a box full of shelf-stable freeze-dried meals, to be revived from their desiccated state with the addition of boiled water. Freeze-dried food is nothing new. As early as the 13th century, the ancient Quechua and Aymara people of Bolivia and Peru pioneered a form of the process by exposing potatoes to the freezing temperatures of the Andes overnight, then drying them in the sun. In 1937, Nestlé used industrial technology to create the world’s first freeze-dried coffee, and in the 60s and 70s, the US military shipped freeze-dried food rations to the troops in Vietnam. Though its light weight and long shelf life are ideal for navigating harsh conditions, freeze-dried food is probably most famous as a cultural curiosity: Like many Americans, I discovered it in a museum gift shop, gawking at the styrofoam-like ice cream that astronauts used to have for dessert. More recently, I encountered it at a disaster preparedness convention in Raleigh, North Carolina, where smiling, gray-haired preppers manned tables piled with plastic bags full of vegetables, meats, and stews.

UBS,"Eco-consciousness is a hot trend. Its become common occurrence to see shoppers with reusable grocery totes at the supermarket. Bamboo straws are flying off shelves as people opt for eco-friendly products. Urban gardening and composting, too, has taken root as consumers try to minimize their carbon footprints. These small actions are encouraging first steps, but theyre not enough when it comes to tackling agricultural contributions to climate change. Strong-worded warnings from the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) detail the potential for climate disasters to worsen if modern consumption patterns dont change and soon. Theres evidence that reimagining urban environments food systems might help reduce carbon emissions. With more than 60% of the global population expected to live in cities by 2030, urban agriculture might be one piece of the puzzle for reducing strain on city resources. The practice typically involves growing food in smaller, city environments such as on rooftops, apartment balconies, or even walls. Heres a look at how urban agriculture innovations might have a positive environmental impact. The agriculturalists dilemma Image: Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash A recent report on global food systems and climate change demonstrates the circular nature of the relationship. Agricultural practices lead to increased carbon emissions. Climate change resulting in part due to those emissions makes it more difficult to maintain stable food systems. If growth rates continue as projected and lifestyle patterns dont change by 2050, nearly three Earths will be needed to support the population. At the same time, the human population continues to grow at record rates. Each day, another 200,000 people join Earths already stressed ecosystem. If growth rates continue as projected and lifestyle patterns dont change by 2050, nearly three Earths will be needed to support the population. Farmers will also need to produce 70 percent more food to sustain so many people. Even though world hunger is a global problem, there is more than enough food to go around today. Inefficient practices, however, mean that much of what is produced is thrown out. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates about a third of the worlds food or around 1.3 billion tons every year ends up wasted. Urban agriculture presents a simple solution to food waste: Grow food more sustainably, closer to where its being consumed. Some concepts that have emerged recently include city gardens in underserved communities the DC UrbanGreens program in Washington, D.C. is one example. In Mexico City, giant plant pillars intended to improve city air quality have been proposed by a group called ViaVerde. Composting, too, encourages city dwellers to rethink how they dispose of food scraps. At-home composting via products like the Vermicondo, a worm composter designed for modern apartments, are gaining popularity. Many composters use their compost mixture to make fertilizer for gardens on their balcony or in other small spaces. These efforts contribute potential environmental benefits and could introduce more green space into cities, too. Startups making a difference Image: Photo by Daria Shevtsova from Pexels A number of social good ventures focused on eliminating food waste at every link in the supply chain have emerged in recent years. These companies are a natural complement to urban agriculture. Tristram Stuart, part of the UBS Global Visionary program, founded his company, Feedback, after witnessing the wastefulness of many grocers, restaurants, and stores. He was particularly disturbed by the common practice of throwing out produce that fails to meet aesthetic standards. Stuarts organization raises awareness about food waste by hosting on-the-ground events. The group also attempts to enact change at the policy level. Feedbacks campaigns include a mix of hard-hitting investigative research, massive public events where salvaged food is served, and pilot projects that test out improved food systems. In 2016, Stuart launched Toast Ale, another startup tackling the issue of food waste with an inventive approach: The company turns surplus bread into beer, and pours its profits back into Feedback and other charities. Another UBS Global Visionary, Iseult Ward, is the co-founder and CEO of FoodCloud, a tech platform that connects surplus food to charity organizations around the UK. To date, more than 4,000 food and retail partners are donating to more than 9,500 charities through FoodCloud. In a video on YouTube, Ward discusses the companys incredible growth in just a few short years. What started as an idea with two people has now become a movement. That gives us huge confidence as to what we can achieve into the future, she says. Refusing plastic bags at the grocery store simply wont cut it when it comes to real, lasting environmental impact. For those invested in turning the tide of climate change, greater commitment is required and urban agriculture may be one part of a long-term solution.

ESG/Sustainable Investing Considerations: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and in some instances integrate the analysis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process and portfolio. Strategies across geographies and styles approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio managers ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of ESG or sustainable investments may be lower or higher than a portfolio where such factors are not considered by the portfolio manager. Because sustainability criteria can exclude some investments, investors may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as investors that do not use such criteria. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance. ©UBS 2018.

But a juror, explaining his thinking years later, said the convict “wasn’t in the ‘good’ black folks category.” The juror added that after studying the Bible, he “wondered if black people even have souls.” The majority opinion said a lower court should reconsider its decision not to hear Mr. Tharpe’s appeal. _____ Photo Credit Tony Gentile/Reuters 6.

And politicians are taking heat from seemingly all fronts, including opposition leaders and environmentalists who say the laws’s execution was bungled. _____ Photo Credit Jamie Squire/Getty Images 7.

Robinson Meyer,"Seventy-six people are dead. At least 1,276 are missing. And more than 7 million have been confined to their homes, as a cloud of toxic, corrosive ash darkens their windows and creeps under their doors. The Camp Fire—which is still burning across some 232 square miles of Northern California—now ranks among the worst natural disasters to hit the United States this century. Only a handful of hurricanes and a “super outbreak” of tornadoes in 2011 have killed more Americans. This fire has robbed more Californians of their lives than has any earthquake since 1933. It came like an ocean of flame. At 6:33 a.m. on Thursday, November 8, someone called 911 about a fire in the woods on Camp Creek Road. (The road would lend the fire its bitterly ironic name.) When firefighters arrive 10 minutes later, they noted the parched conditions and the harsh, hot wind. “This has got the potential for a major incident,” one says over the radio. For the next 24 hours, the Camp Fire devoured roughly a football field of forest every second. By 11 a.m., it grew to 1,000 acres. By noon, its ash cloud blocked out the sun. By 1 p.m., that plume was visible from space, a gray blot smearing across the green of California. That morning, the 26,000 residents of Paradise began to evacuate. But the fire moved too fast. It consumed homes before their occupants could flee and devoured cars while they sat on the road out of town. Later, authorities revealed that in the pandemonium, bulldozers cleared torched cars off the highway so that the cars behind them could escape. Within hours, Paradise was gone. When Californians woke up on Friday, November 9 th, they learned that the Camp Fire had devoured 70,000 acres of land. Now, nine days later, it flickers across some 149,000 acres, and it is only 55 percent contained. There is no disaster like a wildfire. Earthquakes can strike at any time, but they only last for a few moments. Hurricanes might rage for days, but they can be forecast ahead of time. Fire might most closely resemble a tsunami—it arrives like an ocean you can’t outrun—except that fires also choke every city downwind with poisonous billows of ash. Earlier this week, Park Williams, a professor at Columbia, recalled the first time he saw the 100-foot wall of flame that serves as a wildfire’s herald. “It looked like a skyline of buildings,” he told me. “The fire, to me—it’s like an ocean. It’s so strong that we don’t really stand a chance of doing much to it.” It has come to resemble an ocean in its scale, too. The Camp Fire’s smoky air now envelops millions of people, from the state’s desert-like south to its evergreen-crowned north. The ash fills the state’s Central Valley like water in a bathtub —with the Golden Gate as the main plug where it can all rush out. And perhaps the worst aspect here is: This will all happen again. The science on climate change and wildfires is clear—much, much clearer than on many other topics, including hurricanes. Scientists know that scorching-hot summers dry out the needles and twigs on the forest floor, turning them into a tinderbox. They know that climate change has doubled the area that forest fires have burned since 1984. They know that a century of putting out fires—in forests that are evolved to burn regularly—has crammed the timberlands full of burnable fuel. And finally, scientists know that California’s tendency to lurch from a big dry year to a big wet year is intensifying, its “feast and famine” cycle getting more pronounced. They know this will make fires worse, Williams told me: It will allow more plant matter to grow during the wet years; which, during the dry years, will dry out and die and become fire fuel. Seventy-six people, trapped in their homes, fleeing in their cars, now lost forever. And the science is clear: Far more than on hurricanes, far more than on droughts, humanity played a role in this. Through the negligence of spewing carbon into the air, and through the hubris of trying to suppress fires. We have toyed with fire, thinking it in our tool. But the Camp Fire should remind us that we are its plaything.","The Camp Fire now ranks among this century’s worst U.S. natural disasters, and the number of dead could still rise.",2018-11-18T14:51:56Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",A Deadly Tsunami of Fire,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/california-fire-76-are-dead-1276-missing-us-catastrophe/576130/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/11/RTS257IJ/facebook.jpg?1542524072,,Theatlantic.com,Natural disasters,1
"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","A new time-lapse video from space shows flashes of lightning above North and South America. The weather satellite launched to space on March 1st. Buzz60 An artist's rendering of the new GOES-S satellite in orbit around the earth. The satellite launched on March 1, 2018, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. (Photo: Lockheed Martin) Just three months after launch, an instrument aboard the federal government's newest weather satellite has malfunctioned. The instrument — a high-tech camera known as the ""Advanced Baseline Imager"" — is the satellite's premier device for capturing images of natural disasters such as hurricanes, volcanic eruptions and wildfires. The camera was meant to send back extremely detailed pictures of weather and could have surveyed the entire Western Hemisphere in just five minutes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed Wednesday that the imager's infrared sensors aren't being cooled properly. “This is a serious problem,” said Steve Volz, head of NOAA’s satellite and information service. He said the infrared channels “are important elements of our observing requirement, and if they are not functioning fully, it is a loss.” Although the temperature up there is unimaginably cold at about 450 degrees below zero, the sun's rays can still heat up and damage the satellite and the instruments aboard. Scientists are scrambling to understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Officials expect it will take at least a few months to figure out. A team of experts from federal agencies and contractors are looking into the issue and ""pursuing multiple courses of possible corrective actions,"" NOAA said. Harris Corp. designed the instrument, and spokesperson Kristin Jones told the Washington Post that “we are working closely with NOAA, NASA and other industry experts to troubleshoot."" The camera is mounted on the GOES-17 satellite, which was launched on March 1. It hovers over the western U.S. and is a twin of GOES-16, which was launched in November 2016 and keeps an eye on the eastern U.S. GOES stands for geostationary operational environmental satellite, which means the satellite hovers over one spot on Earth, moving along with the planet's rotation about 22,000 miles above the surface. Since its launch in late 2016, GOES-16 has sent back incredible images of powerful hurricanes, major blizzards and severe thunderstorm outbreaks unlike anything seen before from a weather satellite, AccuWeather said.

Zahra Hirji,"It’s official: 2017 set a new record for big, costly disasters in the United States. The nation was struck by 16 hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural disasters last year, each with losses exceeding $1 billion. Combined, these weather and climate disasters cost about $306 billion, according to new data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Hurricanes were the biggest source of damages by far. This past hurricane season resulted in a record-high $265 billion in losses, and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria all ranked in the top five most expensive US tropical cyclones based on preliminary estimates. Although Katrina remained the most expensive hurricane ($161.3 billion), Harvey ranked second ($125 billion), Maria third ($90 billion), Sandy fourth ($70.2 billion), and Irma fifth ($50 billion). The three major hurricanes last year killed about 250 people combined, NOAA estimates. Maria knocked out Puerto Rico’s entire electric grid, triggering the largest blackout in US history. Both Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands are still recovering from the direct strike by the Category 4 hurricane. While Florida continues to recover from Irma’s strong winds and coastal flooding, Texas is still responding to the flood-related damage from Harvey’s record rainfall that dumped up to 50 inches in some places. Previously, 2005 was the most expensive year for disasters, largely due to devastation brought by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, and Rita. A string of deadly fires in the West, including the largest fire in California’s recent history, generated about $18 billion in losses, the new report found. That’s three times higher than the past annual record, according to NOAA. These fires claimed the lives of at least 54 people and damaged or destroyed more than 15,000 homes and other buildings. Some of the other costly US disasters last year include: an outbreak of tornadoes in various southern states in January; California flooding in February; a freeze in the southeast that damaged fruit crops in March; and severe thunderstorms in the midwest in June. Besides being an expensive year for disasters, 2017 was also the third-warmest for the contiguous US since record-keeping began in 1895, NOAA scientists said. The hottest year was 2012, followed by 2016.",Last year marked the costliest US wildfire and hurricane seasons on record.

Robert Lee Hotz,"The impact of global climate change is being felt across the country and, unchecked, could cause U.S. economic losses totaling hundreds of billions of dollars a year by the end of the century, says a new U.S. government report released Friday. Many U.S. communities and companies are trying to counteract the effects of rising temperatures ranging from water shortages or flooding to worsening wildfires and air pollution. But those measures so far fall short, according to the latest installment of the U.S. National Climate Assessment. Neither global efforts to mitigate the causes of climate change nor regional efforts to adapt to the impacts currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health and well-being, the report said. The federal report concludes that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans physical, social, and economic well-being are rising. Mandated by law since 1990, the official climate assessment is produced every four years by the U.S. Global Change Research Program to guide federal policy makers. The new edition, released in English and Spanish, highlights the local impact of rising temperatures across the U.S. This report makes it clear that climate change is not some problem in the distant future. Its happening right now in every part of the country. When people say the wildfires, hurricanes and heat waves theyre experiencing are unlike anything theyve seen before, theres a reason for that, and its called climate change, said Brenda Ekwurzel, climate science director at the Union of Concerned Scientists and a report author. Its conclusions are at odds with statements by President Trump, who has been skeptical of global-warming trends, questioned the validity of climate science, and challenged federal regulations designed to control greenhouse-gas emissions. There has been no external interference in the development of this report, said David Easterling, director of the technical support unit at the National Centers for Environmental Information, who helped prepare the 1,500-page assessment. In all, more than 300 experts guided by a 60-member Federal Advisory Committee produced the report. It was then reviewed by most federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. The reports authors also conducted regional workshops in over 40 cities. The resulting formal federal climate assessment builds on a previous installment released last year that evaluated the underlying science on which climate change predictions are based. All told, 17 of the 18 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000. NASA researchers ranked 2017 as the second-warmest year since 1880, while NOAA scientists ranked it as the third-warmest. So far in 2018, U.S. temperatures for the year-to-date are the 10th-warmest on record, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. Broadly, the warming trend has been driven in large part by land-use changes, including cutting down forests and paving over natural surfaces, and rising emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and methane from livestock production, scientists say. In a separate federal report released Friday, researchers concluded that fossil-fuel emissions in North America have been declining steadily for the past decade, due to a reduced reliance on coal, greater use of natural gas, and increased vehicle fuel-efficiency standards. As a result, North Americas share of global carbon emissions dropped from 24% in 2004 to about 17% in 2013, said William Hohenstein, director of the Office of Energy and Environmental Policy at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But global emissions overall continued to rise. Observations collected around the world provide significant, clear, and compelling evidence that global average temperature is much higher, and is rising more rapidly, than anything modern civilization has experienced, with widespread and growing impacts, the climate assessment report said. The warming trend observed over the past century can only be explained by the effects that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, have had on the climate, it said.

"Geoff Dembicki, Harry Cheadle","A bike docking station during 2017's Hurricane Irma in Miami, one of many severe weather events that were likely made worse by climate change. Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Theres a psychological threshold you cross when a threat you dismissed as vague and abstract suddenly becomes real. An existential threat is distant until it is much too close to ignore, then impossible to stop. Thats what happened to California utility PG&amp;E in mid-January. Fire investigators found that its power lines and transformers started at least 17 of the 21 major state fires of 2017, and potentially several more in 2018 that turned into massive wildfires because of hot and dry conditions worsened by a warming climate. PG&amp;E suddenly faced liabilities of $30 billion and 750 lawsuits; investors freaked and the utility, formerly beloved by hedge funds, declared bankruptcy. Its market value plummeted from $25 billion to less than $4 billion.
If you said just a few years ago that starting forest fires because of transmission malfunctions was going to bankrupt a major American utility, people would be like, No thats crazy, that cant happen, Elias Hinckley, a Washington, DCbased energy and climate finance lawyer at the global law firm K&amp;L Gates, told VICE. But here we are. The Wall Street Journal, whose opinion section has for years been accused of downplaying the planetary risks posed by climate change, reported that PG&amp;Es bankruptcy could mark a business milestone: the first major corporate casualty of climate change.
The question some people in the financial world are now asking is: Who will be next? 
Once you go from understanding climate change as a distant future risk to a clear and present danger that can take down huge companies overnight, you see vulnerabilities everywhere. Here are a few of the potential outcomes: a hurricane that bankrupts the state of Florida, a housing foreclosure crisis caused by flooding in Texas, an economic meltdown brought on by the Colorado River going dry. In December, 415 investors put out a statement warning that unabated climate change could cause $23 trillion in global economic destruction over the next 80 years.
 Thats absolutely accurate, Beau OSullivan, a spokesperson for the UK-based responsible investing advocacy group ShareAction, told VICE. When this carbon bubble bursts well see huge reverberations across our financial system, because climate change is a such a systemic risk that it touches every area of our lives.
There were risk factors apart from climate change in PG&amp;Es financial implosion. California has always been prone to fires, and in recent years the communities that PG&amp;E is required to provide electricity to have been pushing further and further into forested areas. The state also has an unusual law that can make companies liable for forest fire damages even if they arent directly negligent. But the crucial thing to note is that the legal and financial systems that PG&amp;E put in place to navigate these dangers only worked up to a certain point. Those systems werent built to tolerate two years in a row of massive wildfires intensified by climate change. 
The systems [companies have] for managing risk can bend a little bit, Michael Wara, a lawyer and research fellow at Stanford's Woods Institute for the Environment, explained. But they dont sort of gradually evolvewhat happens is they break, and that is what were observing in California right now.
This principle could be applied virtually anywhere in the US. Yet its especially relevant to Florida. Since 1980, the states population has doubled to 20.7 million residents, many of whom live in coastal areas. And despite the risk of catastrophic floods and hurricanes, Miami is at the center of a real estate boom financed in part by overseas investors. None of this would be possible without a massive insurance market that (theoretically) insures homes worth a total of $2.1 trillion from disaster. Local insurers have in recent years been reselling insurance to buyers on Wall Street and around the world, drawing comparisons to the lending models that helped cause the 2008 crash. Additionally, the National Flood Insurance Program, a federally funded program that insures 1.7 million Florida households, is in close to $21 billion of debt. 
The state of Florida itself is heavily leveraged as insurer for much of the cost of extreme weather in the form of hurricanes and other tropical storms, reads a paper from Florida storm risk expert Lorilee Medders. The hurricanes that batter Florida each year are getting stronger and longer, a phenomenon linked to climate change. The states system for managing risk works for now. But Wara thinks the wrong combination of factorsfor example a Category 4 hurricane tearing into Miami along with a major storm surgemight cause major financial disruptions. You could easily see the state of Florida go bankrupt, he said. 
You can also see the makings of a foreclosure crisis. As floods become more severe and frequent thanks to climate change, owners of damaged homes may no longer be able to afford insurance. One Houston homeowners premiums, for instance, went from $600 a year to $9,000 after Hurricane Harvey. And 80 percent of the 100,000 Houston-area homes that flooded during the 2017 disaster had no flood insurance at all, because they were in areas that dont usually flood. Financial services firm CoreLogic has calculated that serious mortgage delinquencies for damaged homes shot up over 200 percent in the wake of the hurricane.
It simply cant be ignored anymore, Ed Delgado, a former executive with Freddie Mac, a major home mortgage loan company, told CNBC earlier this month. Weve been given enough warning signs to take corrective action, and its about time you get proactive instead of waiting for these cataclysmic events to take place.
Those warning signs could not be clearer for the 40 million people who rely on water from the Colorado River Basin. Despite near-constant drought conditions since 2000 and water levels at all-time lows, Arizona, Colorado, California, New Mexico, Utah, and Nevada have failed to negotiate a drought contingency plan, potentially leading the federal government to impose water restrictions by the end of January. If the river basin were to ever fully go dry, it could destroy 16 million jobs and $1.4 trillion worth of economic activity over the course of a year, a 2014 study from Arizona State University estimated. Up until that point everythings going to seem fine, Wara predicted. Then all of sudden its going to be an issue with enormous societal impacts.
Its important to note these are all hypothetical scenarios. None of them are guaranteedor even necessarily likelyto happen. The point that events like PG&amp;Es bankruptcy drives home, however, is climate change is now testing the limits of societys ability to manage and define financial risk. This has not yet appeared to sink in for the planets top risk assessors: insurance companies. 
A recent survey of the worlds 80 largest insurers done by the Asset Owners Disclosure Project found only one-third can say their approach to investing is climate-aware. And 43 percent of the laggards named by the surveythat is, insurers with limited or no consideration of financial risks created by climate changeare based in the US, including such companies as Allstate, Prudential, and New York Life. 
Theyre probably not taking these risks seriously enough because they see them as long-term, said OSullivan from ShareAction, which manages the AODP. They think they have more time, but they dont.
Observers warn that this confidence may be based on faulty assumptions similar to those that caused the financial world to be blindsided by PG&amp;Es collapse. The potential for physical climate risks may change in non-linear ways, such as a coincidence of previous un-correlated events, resulting in unexpectedly high claims burdens, observes a 2018 report from the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. Uninsured losses arising from physical risks may have cascading impacts across the financial system, including on investment companies and banks.
 There appears to be a growing realization in some financial circles that time is quickly ticking down. In mid-January, a review of risks to the global economy put out by the World Economic Forum named extreme weather linked to climate change as the number-one threat. Is the world sleepwalking into a crisis? the report asked. Hinckley agrees the risk of enormous and long-lasting financial damage from climate change is real. If you start to see enough pressure in the system, he said, whether from climate-related calamities or a loss of investor confidence that comes with them. At some point you slide past the place where your economy is growing to one where its retracting. We try to avoid that.

ADAM LIPTAK,"“I’ve always had a broad sense of humor and a candid way of speaking to both male and female law clerks alike,” he wrote. “In doing so, I may not have been mindful enough of the special challenges and pressures that women face in the workplace.” Chief Justice Roberts said he had assembled a task force to examine whether the court system’s procedures for addressing inappropriate conduct were adequate. The young lawyers who serve as law clerks to judges, typically for a year soon after graduating from law school, may require special attention, he suggested, as they are meant to keep confidential what happens in their judge’s chambers. “I expect the working group to consider whether changes are needed in our codes of conduct, our guidance to employees — including law clerks — on issues of confidentiality and reporting of instances of misconduct, our educational programs, and our rules for investigating and processing misconduct complaints,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “These concerns warrant serious attention from all quarters of the judicial branch,” he added. “I have great confidence in the men and women who comprise our judiciary. I am sure that the overwhelming number have no tolerance for harassment and share the view that victims must have clear and immediate recourse to effective remedies.” The remarks on sexual harassment were a brief coda, probably added late in the drafting process, to a report mostly devoted to the court system’s efforts to prepare for natural disasters. “We cannot forget our fellow citizens in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who are continuing to recover from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and those in California who continue to confront historic wildfires and their smoldering consequences,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “The federal judiciary has an ongoing responsibility to prepare for catastrophes and ensure that the third branch of government remains open and functional during times of national emergency.” Noting that a federal law requires federal courts to be “always open,” the chief justice wrote that “the judiciary must anticipate the broad range of calamities that might strike, ranging from severe weather to earthquakes, from cyberterrorism to on-the-ground terrorist attacks.” The past year’s weather posed special challenges, he wrote. “The hurricanes brought flooding, power outages, infrastructure damage and individual hardship to Texas and Florida,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “But the judicial districts of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were especially hard hit.

"Catherine E. Shoichet, CNN","(CNN) A federal judge in California granted a preliminary injunction Wednesday temporarily blocking the government from terminating temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Sudan, El Salvador, Haiti and Nicaragua. US District Judge Edward Chen said the government must maintain TPS and employment authorizations for TPS beneficiaries from those countries while a lawsuit challenging the government's decision to eliminate their protections continues. ""It is hereby ORDERED THAT Defendants, their officers, agents, employees, representatives, and all persons acting in concert or participating with them, are ENJOINED AND RESTRAINED from engaging in, committing, or performing, directly or indirectly, by any means whatsoever, implementation and/or enforcement of the decisions to terminate TPS for Sudan, Haiti, El Salvador, and Nicaragua pending resolution of this case on the merit,"" Chen said in an order issued Wednesday evening. The judge's decision comes a week after a hearing in the case. It goes into effect immediately and is particularly welcome news for TPS recipients from Sudan, who were less than a month away from losing their protections. Temporary protected status, or TPS, protected migrants in the United States from countries that have been hit by dire conditions, such as epidemics, war or natural disasters. Previous administrations had opted to extend the protections for most of the countries involved every few years when they came up for review, but the Trump administration has moved toward ending protections for the majority of immigrants protected under the program, arguing that the initial conditions that prompted the protections are no longer present.

Mark Kaufman,"Americans find modern climate science increasingly convincing, and a damaging mix of exceptional drought, storms, and record-breaking heat is the reason why. 
The results of a new survey conducted in November 2018 by the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute and the research organization The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Researchfound that nearly half of Americans said today's climate science ""is more convincing than five years ago, with extreme weather driving their views.""
Overall, seven in 10 Americans reported that climate change is happening. 
The results of the survey demonstrate that most Americans consider climate change a reality and acknowledge that human activity is at least somewhat responsible, Trevor Tompson, director of The AP-NORC Center, said in a statement. 
The poll gathered responses from just over 1,200 American adults, who were selected randomly from every state in the country. The random sample of Americans gave their answer over the phone or over the web.
While 48 percent of Americans found today's modern climate science more convincing, 36 percent answered that their climate views haven't changed. Just 16 percent said that the climate science ""has become less convincing.""
U.S. government atmospheric, marine, and earth scientists, however, have little doubt that the climate is experiencing profound change, and human activity is the dominant cause, as illustrated by recent reports from U.S. government scientists. 
""This period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization,"" the congressionally mandated Fourth National Climate Assessment, states. 
SEE ALSO: Antarcticas once sleepy ice sheets have awoken. That's bad.
""This assessment concludes, based on extensive evidence, that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,"" the report adds. 
Of the nearly half of Americans who said climate science has become more convincing, three-fourths of them attribute their changing views to the nation's recent bouts of extreme weather. In 2017 and 2018 alone, the U.S. experienced record-breaking heat, record-breaking flooding, record-breaking wildfires, and the relentless continuation of widespread drought over a huge swath of the Southwest.
Political leaders, however, had a comparatively smaller influence over changing how Americans felt about modern climate science. Eighteen percent of those surveyed responded that the views of political leaders were an ""influential factor"" in their changing views.
President Trump, who has by far the most influential reach on Twitter, consistently denies or jokes about global warming. Additionally, powerful Republican politicians continue to publicly sow doubt about climate science. Yet according to this recent poll, their efforts may be significantly overshadowed by the damaging realities of extreme weather. 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found that in 2017 the U.S. ""experienced a historic year of weather and climate disasters,"" with 16 separate billion-dollar disasters.
In total, 71 percent of Americans today reported that climate change is happening, which is similar to a 2017 poll from the same research organizations. As is well understood, most of the doubt about human-caused climate change comes from Republican voters. Of Americans who said climate change is happening, just five percent of Democrats said it can be explained by natural changes in the environment rather than human activity, as compared to nearly 30 percent of Republicans. 
This is consistent with 40 years of sustained Republican suspicion about the sciences, environmental historian James Turner previously explained to Mashable. 
But for the majority of Americans that do acknowledge the climate is changing, more are becoming convinced by mainstream, globally-agreed-upon science. After all, it's difficult to ignore extreme, pummeling weather.","Americans find modern climate science increasingly convincing, and a damaging mix of exceptional drought, storms, and record-breaking heat is the reason why.

Aria Bendix and Aylin Woodward,"In 2018, a devastating report released by The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted a future of extreme heatwaves, severe droughts, mass extinctions, and sea-level rise. Under these conditions, the report said, the world could experience $54 trillion worth of environmental damage. 
 While that scenario might be decades away, companies are already finding ways to profit from humanity's collective fears about climate-related disasters.Read more: Big Oil claims it's doing its part to combat climate change. A new study finds it's not even close.
 In January, a London-based nonprofit called CDP, which collects information from companies about their environmental impact, released thousands of company disclosures explaining how natural disasters, extreme weather, and the need to reduce carbon emissions could translate into serious money-making opportunities. 
 In one of the most striking disclosures, Apple noted that iPhones could help people survive in a disaster by offering flashlights and other emergency services. The company estimated that its brand value would increase by $920 million as customers began to rely on iPhones for personal safety.

Fox News,"Does Norway know something we don’t? The Scandinavian country announced Monday that it is going to spend about $12.7 million to upgrade its “doomsday” seed vault that is the world’s largest repository built to safeguard against wars or natural disasters wiping out global food crops. The Verge reported that the upgrades will focus on a new concrete tunnel and “emergency power and refrigerated units and other electrical equipment that emeits heat through the tunnel.” The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a gene bank built underground on the isolated island in a permafrost zone some 620 miles from the North Pole, was opened in 2008 as a master backup to the world’s other seed banks, in case their deposits are lost. The latest specimens sent to the bank, located on the Svalbard archipelago between mainland Norway and the North Pole, included more than 15,000 reconstituted samples from an international research center that focuses on improving agriculture in dry zones. They were the first to retrieve seeds from the vault in 2015 before returning new ones after multiplying and reconstituting them. The specimens consisted of seed samples for some of the world’s most vital food sources like potato, sorghum, rice, barley, chickpea, lentil and wheat. The agency borrowed the seeds three years ago because it could not access its gene bank of 141,000 specimens in the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo, and so was unable to regenerate and distribute them to breeders and researchers. Fifty thousand samples were deposited last year from seed collections in Benin, India, Pakistan, Lebanon, Morocco, Netherlands, the U.S., Mexico, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus and Britain. It brought the total deposits in the snow-covered vault — with a capacity of 4.5 million — to 940,000.

Chris Perez,"Recent sightings of a rare, serpent-like sea creature — which in Japanese lore, is thought to be a harbinger of natural disasters — have sent Japan’s social media into a frenzy.
“This is no doubt evidence of a precursor to an earthquake,” wrote one Twitter user following two separate discoveries of “oarfish” off the north-coast prefecture of Toyama earlier this week.
“And if it is in the Nankai Trough, it might be a huge quake,” they said, according to the South China Morning Post.
Photos posted on Instagram showed one of the two deep-sea dwellers — which reportedly measured 10.5 and 13 feet, respectively. One was found on the shore of Toyama Bay and the other got caught in a fishing net near the port of Imizu.

According to Japanese legend, the fish will purposely rise to the surface and beach themselves whenever they believe trouble’s on the way. Residents have reported their presence before the arrivals of tsunamis and earthquakes in the past — including the 2011 Fukushima quake. However, experts have said not to worry.

“The link to reports of seismic activity goes back many, many years, but there is no scientific evidence of a connection so I don’t think people need to worry,” explained Hiroyuki Motomura, a professor of ichthyology at Kagoshima University who spoke to the Morning Post.
“I believe these fish tend to rise to the surface when their physical condition is poor, rising on water currents, which is why they are so often dead when they are found,” he said.
Still, the sightings weren’t sitting so well with social media users this week.

“What is going on under Toyama Bay?” tweeted one concerned Japanese resident.
“Is something happening deep in the sea?” another asked.
Many on Japan’s 5-Channel chat site were reportedly referring to the oarfish — which translates to “Messenger from the Sea God’s Palace” — as a “warning” sign.
“There is no scientific evidence at all for the theory that oarfish appear around big quakes. But we cannot 100 percent deny the possibility,” said Uozu Aquarium keeper Kazusa Saiba, speaking to CNN on Friday. “It could be that global warming might have an impact on the appearance of oarfish or a reason we’re just not aware of.”

Rebecca Hersher,"A boy rides his bike through still water after a thunderstorm in the Lakewood area of East Houston, which flooded during Hurricane Harvey.
Claire Harbage/NPR
If they had known, they never would have bought the house on Bayou Glen Road. Sure, it was a beautiful lot, tucked in a bend of the creek, backyard woodsy and wild, the neighbors friendly and the street quiet. A little piece of nature just 20 minutes from downtown Houston. It was exactly what John and Heather Papadopoulos recently married, hoping to start a family were looking for in 2007. They didn't think much about the creek that ran along their yard, aside from appreciating the birds it attracted to the neighborhood.
Across town, the Evans family was similarly indifferent to the wooded bayous that cut through their neighborhood. Janice Perry-Evans chose the house she rented because it was conveniently located near the local high school, which made it easy for her two boys to get to class and home from football practice. Her commute to the post office wasn't far either. Plus, at $800 per month, the rent was affordable. By 2017, the family had lived there for four years, and didn't have any plans to move. 
And then, in August of that year, both homes were destroyed. Both families had to start over from nothing. But today, one family is financially stable. The other is facing bankruptcy.

Disasters are becoming more common in America. In the early and mid-20th century, fewer than 20 percent of U.S. counties experienced a disaster each year. Today, it's about 50 percent. According to the 2018 National Climate Assessment, climate change is already driving more severe droughts, floods and wildfires in the U.S. And those disasters are expensive. The federal government spends billions of dollars annually helping communities rebuild and prevent future damage. But an NPR investigation has found that across the country, white Americans and those with more wealth often receive more federal dollars after a disaster than do minorities and those with less wealth.Federal aid isn't necessarily allocated to those who need it most; it's allocated according to cost-benefit calculations meant to minimize taxpayer risk.
Put another way, after a disaster, rich people get richer and poor people get poorer. And federal disaster spending appears to exacerbate that wealth inequality.
The Flood
Nowhere are the economic and racial inequities of disaster aid more apparent than in communities that have experienced one of the most costly and widespread disasters: urban flooding.
Houston is arguably ground zero for urban flooding a sprawling city built on low and marshy flatlands exposed to hurricanes blowing in from the Gulf of Mexico. In the past decade, there have been five major floods in the city, culminating in the largest amount of rain ever recorded from a single storm: Hurricane Harvey in August 2017.
The Papadopoulos and Evans families were two of the hundreds of thousands of families who evacuated their homes during the storm.
After Hurricane Harvey hit the Texas coast in August 2017, the storm stalled over Houston and dumped as much as 60 inches of rain on some parts of the region.
Katie Hayes Luke for NPR
""We were the first ones to evacuate out of our house, up the street,"" remembers John Papadopoulos. In the years before the hurricane, their home had gone from a refuge to a nightmare. It flooded in 2009, in 2015 and in 2016. By 2017, they knew what to do: Put the valuables up high, and get out. They went to a neighbor's house first, and then to a hotel.
It was a new experience for the Evans family. ""When the water started coming up, we thought we were going to have to go on the roof,"" says Janice Perry-Evans. ""But we ended up not going on the roof. We ended up, me and the kids, packing up a little bit of stuff"" in a plastic container.
""We got out and we walked in that water,"" she remembers. The water was up to her armpits in places. Eventually, a dump truck carried them to a bus, and the bus dropped them at the convention center downtown.
The next morning, Perry-Evans and Papadopoulos took the same first step to start rebuilding their lives they turned to the federal government for help. But almost immediately, their experiences diverged.

From the beginning, a lot of things went right for the Papadopoulos family. John's employer, Microsoft, gave him as much time off as he needed and more than $10,000 to help with rent and other bills that piled up after the flood. The Papadopouloses rented a townhouse nearby and, within a few months, the federal aid they had applied for began to arrive.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency gave them $30,000; because the family owned a home that had been destroyed in the flood, the Internal Revenue Service sent checks for more than $100,000 in refunded taxes a perk of having a relatively high income. The Small Business Administration gave the family a low-interest loan.
About a year after the storm, Papadopoulos said, his family was financially stable.
The Evans family was not.

Janice Perry-Evans had one goal after the floodwaters receded: find a place to stay. She didn't have any savings for a hotel or a new apartment, so when a co-worker offered her a room in his house, she took it, even though it was one room for her and her three kids and it was a 45-minute drive from work and school.
Then, she started applying for help from FEMA.
The agency gave her about $2,500, enough to cover a deposit and first month's rent in a new place, but Perry-Evans needed the money for something else. Her oldest son was hoping for a college football scholarship. He couldn't afford to miss school or football practice that fall, and the family couldn't afford for Perry-Evans to miss shifts as a mail carrier for the post office.
""I had to go to work, and I had to get these boys back and forth to school. So I took that [money] and I put it for a car,"" she explains.
With her immediate transportation needs met, Perry-Evans went back to FEMA to see about getting more money for housing, but she says agency representatives reprimanded her for incorrectly using the money she had been given.
Perry-Evans never missed a day of work as a mail carrier for the USPS in the months she spent applying for disaster funds.
Claire Harbage/NPR
""Some of them were kind of rude,"" she remembers. ""Some of them felt sorry for me because I would be crying, [saying] 'Hey, I have nowhere to go. I don't have no money. You guys are not helping me like I thought.' ""
FEMA didn't block Perry-Evans from reapplying for housing money, but she says after the scolding she turned to other potential sources of federal aid, unsuccessfully. Her income wasn't high enough to claim a significant tax refund. She says she was denied a low-interest loan from the Small Business Administration because her credit score was too low. A FEMA representative suggested she try to get housing money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but after she used her day off to go to an information session, she was informed that her income was too high to qualify.
""It was like every time I tried something, it was an obstacle in the way,"" she says.
The entire time, Perry-Evans says, she never missed a shift at the post office. She even worked the week that Hurricane Harvey hit Houston. She often worked six days a week. But her paycheck just wasn't enough to cover all her bills, and her co-worker said it was time for the family to move out of the spare room.
Six months after the flood, Perry-Evans did the only thing she felt she could: She signed a lease to rent a house that cost 50 percent more than where they used to live, for less space. The electricity didn't always work. For more than a year after the flood, Perry-Evans was still sleeping on a cot she took from the convention center.
The Rich Get Richer; The Poor Get Poorer
Perry-Evans is not alone in her struggle. ""Recovery for vulnerable families [looks] a lot different than it does for more affluent neighborhoods,"" says Kathy Payton, the director of the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corp., a neighborhood nonprofit that works a few miles from where Perry-Evans lives.

Payton grew up in Houston and has spent decades supporting the basic needs of her neighbors, many of whom live on fixed incomes or do not have a cushion of savings to fall back on after a disaster.
""We had loss of income because people lost their jobs. We had increased health issues as a result of them living in bad situations,"" she says, ticking off the cascade of challenges lower-income families have contended with since the flood. Many families struggle to successfully apply for money because they do not have access to a computer, she says, or do not have all the paperwork they need, or can't take time off from work to meet with a FEMA representative.
Payton says wealthier families are more able to comply with the rigid application requirements. ""There shouldn't be a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all template,"" she says. ""You've got to make adjustments based on the vulnerabilities and the needs of the families. And that's not what we do.""
Those application requirements are not explicitly designed to favor some citizens over others. Under the 1988 federal disaster relief law, the requirements exist to protect taxpayers from fraudulent or improper payouts after a storm, by keeping track of who has been given money for what.
But Payton says the upshot in Houston is that the more affluent parts of the city have recovered more quickly and deeply since the flood. Private insurance accounts for some of that, but Payton also believes residents in those areas have been more successful at getting federal money.
""Those families who are more apt to be able to respond to that [funding] will do so quickly, will do so more efficiently and the funds will be available on a first come, first serve basis,"" she says. Families who cannot, she says, ""will be left behind again.""

Claire Harbage/NPR
A new and growing body of research backs up Payton's observations. Studies by sociologists, as well as climate scientists, urban planners and economists, suggest that disasters, and the federal aid that follows, disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans. The same is also true along racial lines, with white communities benefiting disproportionately.
""Cities are often very unequal to begin with,"" says James Elliott, a sociologist at Rice University. ""They're segregated and there are lots of income disparities, but what seems to happen after natural hazards hit is these things become exacerbated.""
""We see these same patterns of wealth inequality being exacerbated in communities that receive more FEMA aid,"" explains sociologist Junia Howell of the University of Pittsburgh. Howell and Elliott have published multiple studies that find a pattern in who wins and who loses after floods and other disasters: Rich people get richer after a storm, and poor people get poorer.
""That's particularly true along racial lines, along lines of education, as well as homeownership versus renting,"" explains Howell. And rather than mitigating the inequity, federal aid exacerbates it, in part because of the biases Payton has noticed that are baked into how federal money is distributed.
NPR examined one federal disaster program and found evidence of exactly that phenomenon. The program uses federal and local money to purchase homes that have flooded or been affected by other natural disasters and permanently turn the lots into green space to reduce flood risk.
The buyouts are voluntary, and the homeowner can use the money to move to a safer place. As climate change drives more extreme rain, David Maurstad of FEMA says he expects the program to grow more in the coming years.
But buyouts have disproportionately gone to whiter communities. NPR analyzed records of about 40,000 property buyouts funded by FEMA and state and local governments and found that most of them were in neighborhoods that were more than 85 percent white and non-Hispanic. (For context, the nation as a whole is 62 percent white/non-Hispanic, and disasters affect communities of all demographics.)

A Tale of Two Cities
Hurricane Harvey in Houston was a cataclysmic event. But more extreme rainfall is falling all over the United States, and that means more flooding. The trend will continue in the coming years, and so will the need for disaster relief programs and programs designed to mitigate damage. But even when those programs work as designed, NPR has found that inequality persists.
More than 1,500 miles northeast of Houston, two towns show how disaster relief efforts are determined and who wins and who loses in the calculation.
Manville, N.J., an hour outside Manhattan, has flooded repeatedly since the 1970s. On a recent tour, Superintendent of Schools Robert Beers drove over a bridge and into a neighborhood called Lost Valley, a suburban enclave of Cape Cod-style homes built in a compact grid along the Raritan River.
The numbers spray-painted on the front of this house in the Lost Valley neighborhood in Manville, N.J., indicate that it was bought as part of a federal disaster program. The program uses federal and local money to purchase houses that have flooded multiple times and permanently turn the lots into green space to reduce flood risk.
Claire Harbage/NPR
""This area was hit the hardest,"" he says. ""And as we drive through you're going to be able to see a lot of vacant homes, and areas that were bulldozed. Some of these open, these vacant lots here, there were homes here.""
Over the past two decades about 150 homeowners in Manville have taken disaster buyouts, and 80 more abandoned their homes. A drop in household incomes followed, and home values lagged behind nearby towns.
""After the first flood, people began thinking, 'Is it time to get out?' "" says Eleanor Nieliwocki, who lived in Lost Valley for more than 30 years. ""After the second flood, not again. And the third flood, we've had it."" She finalized the sale of her house to a government buyout in 2015.
""We've had to cut programs; class sizes have grown; and, quite frankly, we haven't been able to offer the supports that our students so desperately need,"" said Robert Beers, the superintendent of Manville School District.
Claire Harbage/NPR
And buyouts like Nieliwocki's matter to Beers. All those vacant lots affect how much money his schools get. Fewer homes overall mean less tax revenue to fund education. Last year, Manville's public school system found itself battling large budget shortfalls. At the same time, Beers says, the schools faced new demands: Since 1999's Hurricane Floyd, Manville's Hispanic population had risen from 5 percent to 23 percent.
""Nearly 30 percent of our students speak only Spanish at home, so we need to fund additional positions to transition these children and provide them with the services they need,"" Beers said last spring. (By summer, after an intense lobbying effort, Beers was able to get the state government to increase funding for Manville's schools.)
And even though the buyouts in Manville hurt the tax base, FEMA says the strategy actually saves money in the long run. The agency says for every dollar spent on buyouts and other hazard mitigation programs, federal taxpayers save $6 in future disaster losses. The agency has allocated more than $15 billion on those strategies since 1989.
Students walk through the hallways of Manville High School between class periods. Fewer homes have meant fewer tax dollars to fund education, and the public school system has found itself battling large budget shortfalls.
Claire Harbage/NPR
""I think our program is achieving in Manville what it's intended to achieve,"" says Maurstad, who oversees FEMA's buyout program. He says FEMA is meeting its goals if it makes a community less risky, saves property and potentially saves lives.
And he points out that while FEMA pays 75 percent of the cost to buy out homes in disaster-prone areas, states and localities decide where they want those buyouts to occur, so demographic changes aren't on the federal agency's radar.
""I'm not aware that there's been a specific study by FEMA or anyone else on the demographic distribution of [the buyout] approach,"" says Maurstad. ""But the approach itself is not one that would necessarily, intentionally lead to those outcomes.""

Claire Harbage/NPR
Reeling from repeated floods, Manville asked the Army Corps of Engineers to build a flood control system to protect it. In 2016, the Corps said no.
Catherine Kling, an economist at Cornell University, studies the kind of benefit-cost analysis the Corps does to decide which property is worth saving. ""The whole idea of a benefit-cost analysis is actually very simple,"" Kling says. ""It simply seeks to answer the question: If we do this project, is the total value from this project greater than the total costs?""
That means that protecting 10 families in $1 million houses has the same value as protecting 100 families in $100,000 houses.
In Manville, the Corps counted about 500 homes and businesses in flood zones and said it could protect them for about $67 million. But for every dollar spent on the project, only 40 cents' worth of property would be saved. Under federal guidelines, that's not enough.
""It is completely agnostic as to who receives those benefits and those costs,"" says Kling. And, she says, economists assume the people displaced and the economic activity they generate will simply move somewhere else.
A woman walks her dog on the levee in Bound Brook, N.J. The town, which is just 4 miles from Manville, was awarded a $650 million flood control project.
Claire Harbage/NPR
Still, even if the approach is designed to avoid picking winners and losers, it ends up doing so anyway, favoring wealthier neighborhoods. ""It's also going to be [choosing] more valuable businesses,"" Kling says. ""More valuable real estate.""
Indeed, if there were a climate change lottery with public funding as the prize, you could say Bound Brook, N.J., just 4 miles from Manville, hit the jackpot: a sweeping, $650 million flood control project whose local portion was completed in 2016. Developers followed, investing tens of millions of dollars.
In Bound Brook, on a very different tour around town last summer, Councilman Abel Gomez detailed plans for hundreds of upscale apartments, new restaurants and an expanded Main Street. ""Without flood control,"" he said, ""you were always the next natural disaster before you were wiped out.""

But some residents worry how they will afford to live there once the new projects are completed. Bound Brook has one of the nation's largest concentrations of Costa Ricans enough that the country's president visited in 2014 and a history of alleged housing discrimination. The Justice Department sued the town in 2004, saying its housing policies discriminated against Latinos, and for years its housing and development practices were regulated by a consent decree. In 2017, a local government analysis found that households in the most heavily Latino neighborhoods had lower incomes and spent a greater portion of their incomes on housing than those in the majority-white area.
Some of the newer apartments are already renting for hundreds more than the town's median rent.
Francisco Morales Mora, who emigrated from Costa Rica in 1994 and owns a restaurant downtown, says that's too much. ""The people of Bound Brook are poor,"" he says. ""And unless the new [apartments] are cheaper, people will leave.""
Francisco Morales Mora, a Costa Rican immigrant, owns a restaurant called Frank's in downtown Bound Brook. Morales says more development in town, fueled by feelings of relative safety from floods, will be good for business and make the town more vibrant. But he worries about affordability.

Robert Greco, the project's manager for the Corps, says the flood control project in and around Bound Brook protects a highly dense area with a range of income levels. He says it isn't intended to favor the wealthy but acknowledges that the project is changing the area.
""The Borough of Bound Brook is not wealthy,"" Greco says. ""But guess what, now they're building and the economic vitality is picking up, and it's beautiful, actually.""
Pressed on what the new, expensive development plan might mean for the Latino community, Gomez, the councilman, says, ""We really, really hope that the Latino identity that's here remains here. ... Because that's key to this. It sets us apart.""

The bigger picture around the country is that some Americans will be more vulnerable and some will be more resilient in the face of climate change. And who wins and who loses appears to mirror existing inequalities.
""Hardworking Americans who are working class are going to find their communities stressed even more than they are now,"" says Andrew Light, an editor of the 2018 National Climate Assessment. ""If you're already a community at risk, you're going to be at more risk.""
In Houston, the Papadopouloses have applied for a buyout and are likely to be offered one if they wait long enough. It may take years. 
Janice Perry-Evans and her family are still in their rental but, ""It is really a struggle now to stay afloat,"" she says. She plans to file for bankruptcy.
And in Manville, even as the Army Corps of Engineers declined to build a flood control project, it predicted that ""significant flooding can result in municipal infrastructure damage, loss of jobs, and closure of businesses,"" as well as ""continued potential for loss of life.""
Over the past two decades about 150 homeowners in Manville have taken disaster buyouts, and 80 more abandoned their homes. This house in Lost Valley was bought out.

Jacob Passy,"Long after the debris has been cleared, natural disasters have a lasting effect on those who are left to pick up the pieces.
It can take years for peoples finances to recover, according to a new report from the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C. think tank. 
The report examined credit-bureau data for communities that were hit by a natural disaster from 2011 through the summer of 2014.
The Urban Institute identified these communities by looking for ZIP codes where at least one household had applied for assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agencys Individuals and Households Program.
The combination of devastating natural disasters with financially fragile families can be a recipe for not only short-term financial hardship, but also long-term declines in financial health, the reports authors wrote.
The overall pattern of results also broadly suggests that disasters do more than harm residents; they also widen existing inequalities, it added.

Here is what the report found:
Disasters have a negative effect on most aspects of peoples financial lives
The negative impacts of natural disasters run the gamut from poor credit scores and debt collections to home foreclosures.
In many cases, these effects increase in magnitude over time following the initial disaster. After Superstorm Sandy, there was an initial 7-point drop in credit scores on average in the year after the storm battered the Northeast. But two years later, credit scores had dropped by an average of 10 points from levels before the hurricane.
The same was true for the share of people who had debt in collections. This segment of the population in areas affected by natural disasters was 5 percentage points larger in the first year following, three years later it was 10 percentage points higher.
Four years after Hurricane Sandy, the average credit score in affected communities had dropped by 10 points.
The disasters themselves dont directly cause peoples credit profile to worsen or their debt to go unpaid. Rather, these events complicate their lives. A destroyed workplace can disrupt someones employment and reduce their wages. Damage to ones home or belongings creates added costs. As those factors combine, consumers can find it much harder to pay off bills and debt.
Consequently, the financial impact of a natural disaster can get worse over time. Having debt in collections or going into foreclosure will damage a persons credit score. Having a bad credit score can then make it harder for them to get a new or higher-paying job or to take out a loan to help pay for the recovery.
These people may then need to turn to alternative methods for making ends meet, such as payday loans, which can be costly and further exacerbate their ability to bounce back.

Medium-sized disasters may be worse for peoples finances than major ones
Researchers found that across most measures of financial health, people were worse off in the wake of smaller disasters than they were in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, which caused over $70 billion in damage and ranks as the third costliest storm to ever hit the U.S.
Residents hit by medium-sized disasters may experience greater financial struggles because these disasters do not receive the influx of federal support that large disasters receive, the authors wrote.
Congress is less likely to appropriate special funds for assistance to these communities than they are for those hit by larger, more destructive events. Thats in spite of the fact that medium-sized disasters on an individual level can be just as troubling as a huge storm or other disaster.
The reports authors added that more research into this issue was needed, as their analysis of the differing financial impact for medium-sized disasters largely focused on 2014 flooding in Michigan. Because that event hit urban areas with a different socioeconomic makeup than much of the country, other medium-sized disasters may not necessarily lead to the same financial devastation. They also suggested that lawmakers consider broadening the scope of disasters that qualify for additional government assistance.
Disasters can exacerbate existing inequality
While the financial effects of a natural disaster do cut across all income brackets, its the people who are already struggling before a catastrophe that suffer the worst financial effects because of it.
For instance, people who had poor credit before a disaster will experience more significant declines as a result. The average credit score among those with initially poor credit dropped by 29 points four years after a medium-sized disaster. Comparatively, the average score for people with initially good credit only declined by 8 points in that time.

 (CNN)At any given moment, Dan Schachner, who has been refereeing the Puppy Bowl for eight years, can be found buried under a pile of puppies or shouting encouragement like, ""Amazing work, Pistachio!"" to a tiny white Maltese from Every Dog Counts Rescue in Indiana. 
Schachner, an actor and also a dog foster parent, wants everyone who watches the Puppy Bowl, which airs just hours before the Super Bowl, to not simply enjoy the heartwarming nature of the games, but to learn more about the importance of adopting pets from local shelters and supporting rescue groups. 
In other words, the Puppy Bowl isn't just meant to be a frivolous distraction; it's a carefully orchestrated event that seeks to raise awareness about the importance of animals and their health and safety. Each year, when people make the decision to add a pet to their family, they often decide to buy one. The Puppy Bowl, which puts every puppy who participates up for adoption, uses its platform to dare us to adopt instead, making the poignant case that adopting a pet is saving a life.
The Puppy Bowl may be succeeding in its mission. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to animals, some 6.5 million companion animals enter US shelters each year. If those animals don't get adopted, they risk being euthanized. In 2011, roughly 2.6 million shelter animals were euthanized. But those numbers have dropped to 1.5 million per year. Schachner, who has been moved to see more and more animals adopted each year, tells me, ""I'm not saying it is because of us, but we are part of a movement that is increasing awareness."" 
So, how does Schachner persuade viewers to get involved in pet adoption? I refer you to this year's Puppy Bowl. 
During 2019's prefilmed event, which I covered, Schachner shared the football field with 96 puppies, 36 of which have special needs. The dogs were divided into Team Ruff and Team Fluff, and they competed for the Lombarky Trophy in a game that roughly resembles football but is mostly chaos. 
The halftime show featured a variety of other animals: dozens of kittens, some of whom jumped out of a large cardboard cake; a sloth eating pieces of fruit; baby porcupines who shyly chased each other in circles; a baby kangaroo who jumped in and out of a cloth purse backstage; and a capybara who was most excited about eating the corn on the cob offered by his handler. Youth volunteers lined the sides of the field and made sure no puppies, porcupines or other animals fell off the stage during the game. 
Where does the event get its star players? Every year, the Puppy Bowl includes dogs from many shelters -- 53 in total this year. One of those is The Sato Project, which is dedicated to rescuing abused and abandoned dogs from Puerto Rico. Although the Puppy Bowl has worked with The Sato Project for years, this year the organizers wanted to include a dog from Puerto Rico in the Puppy Bowl and use his story to highlight the toll of Hurricane Maria on the island.
To recruit dogs for the 2019 Puppy Bowl and raise awareness about the plight of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, Schachner and other members of the Animal Planet team traveled to Playa Lucinda last summer. Unfortunately, after Hurricane Maria, many people were forced to abandon their dogs because they were focused on their own survival, and the shelters on the island have been overwhelmed. 
After a natural disaster, human lives take priority, but it is also important to think about pets that get left behind. As Schachner explained to me, the trip to Puerto Rico brought home the toll of the hurricane on humans and animals: ""There is still a lot of work to be done. My biggest takeaway from Puerto Rico was that the commonwealth needs more help."" 
When the Puppy Bowl launched in 2005, the goal was to get all the dogs adopted. Since then, the organizers have expanded their mission to include highlighting the story of the dogs and the shelters that support them across the United States and Puerto Rico. 
This year, puppies from cities like Miami and Houston, which have experienced natural disasters, will be competing. In sharing the stories of these puppies, the Puppy Bowl hopes to bring attention to areas of the country that have been hit hard by natural disasters. 
Schachner sees his job as referee as giving him the opportunity to let people know about the joys of fostering and adopting animals. It makes him proud to be part of an event that raises awareness about adoption. ""Dogs ... make us more human and they make us better people,"" he says, before running onto the field to pick up and kiss Lola, a shar-pei from Florida Little Dog Rescue, congratulating her on a stunning play. 
So, tune in -- and don't be surprised if these stories bring you to tears (happy ones!) and make you want to adopt a furry friend from your local shelter.","At any given moment, Dan Schachner, who has been refereeing the Puppy Bowl for eight years, can be found buried under a pile of puppies or shouting encouragement like, ""Amazing work, Pistachio!"" to a tiny white Maltese from Every Dog Counts Rescue in Indiana.",2019-01-30T21:32:53Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Why you can't miss Puppy Bowl 2019,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/30/opinions/puppy-bowl-importance-adoption-rescue-alice-driver/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190130133224-04-puppy-bowl-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Natural disasters,1
"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Potential medical bills might be the last thing on your mind during your summer getaway, but if something bad happens to you or a family member on vacation, you’ll want to know what your insurance will cover. If you’re traveling in the U.S., where you go and what type of facility you seek care from will affect how big your bill is when you get home. Many places will be considered out-of-network, but you may be able to find in-network care if you plan ahead. When you’re abroad, things get a bit more complicated. Here are some general tips when traveling: Keep your insurance card in your wallet. Bring a list of any medications you’re on. Make sure you have a healthy supply of the medications you’re on. You may be able to ask your doctor for a “vacation override” to pick up your prescription ahead of time. Know what your insurance covers, and check for in-network facilities where you’re traveling. See if your doctor offers telehealth services, like a video consultation. Beyond that, here’s what to keep in mind. When You’re Traveling to a Different State If you’re in the U.S. and you have a medical emergency, your insurance should cover your trip to the ER regardless of where you are, according to Consumer Reports. “Under the Affordable Care Act, if you need emergency care, your co-pay or co-insurance cannot be higher than your in-network rate, even at out-of-network hospitals,” CR reports. That said, you should be careful—some insurers, like Anthem, have said they can deny claims that don’t match their definition of an “emergency.” And others levy expensive co-pays on ER visits, which could put you in trouble if you have a high-deductible health plan. And the ambulance ride to the hospital can also cost you big. You’ll also want to be aware that many physicians in ERs are contractors, meaning even if you go to an in-network hospital, they could be considered out-of-network. Then you’ll have a huge bill to deal with. A non-emergency visit could end up costing you too, if it’s billed out-of-network. Walk-in clinics and urgent care centers could be viable alternatives, if you can find one—often, wait times are lower and you’ll pay a co-pay similar to a doctor’s visit. In all cases, you should ask for all paperwork related to your case when you leave the hospital, including itemized list of charges. Once you receive your bill, request an explanation of benefits (EOB) statement from your insurer, which will explain the breakdown of what they cover and what you’re responsible for. “Then, compare bills and EOBs to make sure you received the services noted and have your insurer confirm that providers who sent bills are indeed not in your plan,” suggests CR. People with pre-existing medical conditions could lose their individual health insurance coverage… Read more Read When You’re Traveling Abroad Check with your insurer before you leave to see what your coverage is. You may be surprised to learn that you do have coverage in some cases, though you’ll likely be billed out-of-network, which will be pricey. So make sure you know what the out-of-pocket expenses—including your deductible and co-pays—are for out-of-network care. According to CR, while Medicare won’t cover you outside the U.S., some “Medicare Advantage and Medigap plans offer worldwide emergency care.” And you’ll want to ask your “insurer about exclusions for injuries related to terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, adventure activities such as scuba diving and mountain climbing, and exacerbations of pre-existing conditions.” You can buy supplemental travel insurance to fill in gaps in your care. And be prepared to pay upfront if you need medical attention abroad. You can work out the repayment details when you’re back on American soil.","Potential medical bills might be the last thing on your mind during your summer getaway, but if something bad happens to you or a family member on vacation, you’ll want to know what your insurance will cover.

BeauHD,"Under one proposal outlined in the memo, which was reported by Bloomberg, the Department of Energy would order grid operators to buy electricity from struggling coal and nuclear plants for two years, using emergency authority that is normally reserved for exceptional crises like natural disasters. That idea triggered immediate blowback from a broad alliance of energy companies, consumer groups and environmentalists. On Friday, oil and gas companies joined with wind and solar organizations in a joint statement condemning the plan, saying that it was ""legally indefensible"" and would force consumers to pay more for electricity. The administration has also discussed invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, which allows the federal government to intervene in private industry in the name of national security. (Harry S. Truman used the law to impose price controls on the steel industry during the Korean War.) If the Trump administration were to invoke these two statutes, the move would almost certainly be challenged in federal court by natural gas and renewable energy companies, which could stand to lose market share.","According to The New York Times, President Trump has ordered Energy Secretary Rick Perry to ""prepare immediate steps"" to stop the closure of unprofitable coal and nuclear plants around the country.

Virginia Hughes,"Donald Trump made his opinion of global warming clear in 2012, when he tweeted that it ""was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."" As president, Trump has packed his administration with leaders who have expressed doubts about the existence or intensity of man-made climate change, including: Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, DOE chief Rick Perry, and EPA head Scott Pruitt. Meanwhile, the Heartland Institute — a controversial free-market think tank that argues global warming has been ""exaggerated"" and that carbon emissions don't need to be curbed — has been strategizing how to further influence the administration, particularly getting rid of the ""endangerment finding"" that allows the EPA to treat carbon as an air pollutant. In February, Britain's Mail on Sunday triggered a blitz in conservative media outlets by publishing a story claiming that US government scientists had used flawed global warming data. Seven months later, the newspaper admitted that it had the story wrong. But the debunk did not make the same splash as the original report — not even close. A BuzzFeed News analysis showed that the debunking articles were only shared about one-quarter as much as the bogus story was. It's been quite a year for US climate change policies, with the Trump administration rolling back a host of environmental regulations in the name of helping the economy. Goodbye to the Paris Agreement, the Climate Action Plan, the Clean Power Plan, climate advisory groups, and even the words ""climate change"" on some federal websites. The oil giant BP has seen a series of headline-making accidents in the last couple of decades. In 2005, 15 people died from explosions at a Texas refinery. The next year, a spill in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, led to millions of dollars in fees. And in 2010, the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform off the coast of Louisiana saw the largest oil spill in US history, killing 11 workers. Between the high fines and PR problems, BP would have a tough time surviving another accident on that scale. And yet, BP Alaska saw at least 27 accidents in 2017, including five that risked workers' lives. Internal emails, recordings, interviews, and other documentation obtained by BuzzFeed News show how its executives are struggling to fend off a catastrophe. “We must change now; we must have a reset,” one email said. From January through November 2017, temperatures in the contiguous U.S. were the third warmest on record (just behind 2015 and 2016 ), according to NOAA. Temperatures in the Arctic were the second-highest ever recorded, and Arctic sea ice levels reached a new low in the winter of 2017, falling some 1.2 million square miles short of past winters. Sea ice in Antarctica, too, reached historic lows, although it's less clear how this might be related to climate change. A warming Arctic threatens the future of the polar bears, which stand on sea ice while hunting. (Earlier this month, a video of a starving bear went viral — but some scientists pointed out that the bear could have just been sick or injured.) Scientists also discovered this year that the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may make wheat, rice, and other crops less nutritious. Climate change is also making extreme floods, wildfires, and hurricanes more likely. Although it's difficult to say whether global warming drove any of the particular disasters of 2017, there were certainly a lot of them. Hurricane Harvey drowned Houston, killing dozens, damaging 13 toxic waste sites, floating fire ant colonies, and releasing more than 5 million pounds of pollutants. Irma tore through the Caribbean and Florida, killing dozens and leaving millions without power. And Maria pummeled Puerto Rico, causing many more deaths than the official count and the largest blackout in US history. Intense wildfires blazed through the Western US, destroying thousands of homes and businesses in California and leaving many struggling to breathe. And in the span of just two weeks, Mexico was shook by two massive earthquakes, crumbling buildings and killing hundreds. (There's one positive way to look at the year in natural disasters: Although the US, Mexico, and Caribbean were hit particularly hard this year, if you look at the global numbers, 2017's disasters actually caused fewer deaths than in most other years in recent history.) Trump appears to be the first US president skeptical of vaccines, or at least sympathetic to those who believe that the signature public health achievement of the 20th century could be dangerous. ""If I were President I would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take - AUTISM,"" he tweeted in 2014. In January of this year, before Trump was even sworn in, a leading vaccine critic, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., claimed that the president-elect had chosen him to lead a committee on vaccine safety. A month later, Kennedy and actor Robert De Niro announced a challenge — with a $100,000 prize — to prove the safety of vaccines. (A slew of studies have already debunked the link between autism and vaccines.) Although that vaccine commission has yet to materialize (and Kennedy told STAT in August that he hadn't spoken to Trump about it since February), the antivax movement isn't going anywhere. This fall, the world's most famous antivaxxer, disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield, starred in a new documentary. The Pathological Optimist is a provocative look at how Wakefield became a martyr — and how he still manages to bring in donations, even after his work has been discredited. The CDC recorded 120 measles cases this year in 15 states (as of December 2), the majority of which were unvaccinated. The largest outbreak happened in Minnesota, driven by vaccination fears among Somali immigrants. A scientific report in October found that, of the 1,789 US measles cases reported to the CDC between 2001 and 2015, almost 70% were unvaccinated people. (Measles news looks better globally: the number of deaths from measles dropped to an all-time low in 2016, to about 90,000.) It has not been a good year for Cornell food psychology researcher Brian Wansink. Independent researchers began digging into — and blogging about — inconsistencies in at least 50 of his papers, spurring journalists to do the same. Wansink has had four full retractions this year and at least eight corrections, and Cornell has launched an investigation into his work. BuzzFeed News reported that Wansink's Smarter Lunchrooms Movement — a $22 million federally funded program that used his research as the basis of health eating strategies in 30,000 schools — drew upon flawed studies. One of those papers, about whether an Elmo sticker could make a kid choose an apple over a cookie, ended up being retracted once for statistical errors, and a second time because it was actually done on toddlers, not 8-11 year olds. In yet other work, Wansink bizarrely got the same number of responses to what seemed to be very different surveys. The public reckoning of Wansink's work, other researchers say, is emblematic of psychological research as a whole. As Stephanie Lee wrote in one of the Wansink stories: To outside scientists, it reeked of statistical manipulation — that the data had been sliced and diced so much that the results were just false positives. It’s a problem that has cropped up again and again in social science research, and that a growing number of scientists are trying to address by replicating studies and calling out errors on social media. Quartz published one of the most depressing (and, let's admit, most fun) stories of the year by comparing the products sold at the ""wellness"" empires of the left — Moon Juice and Goop — and the conspiracy-laced Infowars. As they described the project: We at Quartz have created a compendium, from Ashwagandha to zizyphus, of the magical healing ingredients both sides of the political spectrum are buying, and how they are presented to each. We looked at the ingredients used in products sold on the Infowars store, and compared them to products on the wellness shops Moon Juice and Goop. All make similar claims about the health benefits of these ingredients, but what gets called “Super Male Vitality” by Infowars is branded as “Sex Dust” by Moon Juice. In a shocking series, ProPublica and NPR showed that the US maternal mortality rate is the highest among developed countries, and that black mothers are hit especially hard, dying about three to four times the rate of white mothers. What's more, pregnant women — white or black — who deliver at ""black-serving"" hospitals have a higher rate of complications than those who deliver elsewhere. Black babies, too, are dying at an appalling rate, about twice that of white babies, as reported by The Nation. Antibiotics are becoming less effective as bacteria develop resistance against them, leading to a resurgence of dangerous infections. Gonorrhea, for example, is becoming harder to kill, with three countries (France, Spain, and Japan) reporting strains of the virus that are ""untreatable."" Syphilis, a deadly STI that was close to cured 15 years ago, is also making a comeback. As the New York Times reported in August, the opioid epidemic has fueled people to trade sex for drugs, spurring a syphilis outbreak in Oklahoma. The search for effective ways to kill superbugs has gotten so desperate that the US Navy is building a library of 300 sewer viruses that could be deployed in a century-old approach known as phage therapy. Another year, another round of stories of controversial medical treatments that could bring harm to patients. At one Florida clinic, doctors took fat cells from patients' bellies and injected them into their eyeballs, an experimental therapy for macular degeneration. Three of these women went blind. At another clinic, also in Florida, a rogue doctor teaches parents how to give poop transplants to their children with autism. And in 36 states, dentists and orthodontists lodged complaints against SmileDirectClub, an online upstart that offers DIY braces at a fraction of the cost of a typical orthodontist, claiming that this service risks patients' oral health. In response, the company threatened legal action against the dentists who criticized it. Following 2016's explosive story about aerial surveillance by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, this year BuzzFeed News revealed other eyebrow-raising examples of government and military spy planes hiding from public scrutiny. A US Marshals plane, for example, circled above Eldorado, Mexico, while Mexican authorities captured the bodyguard of a key figure in the drug trade. Another plane, operated by an obscure company in Oklahoma, ran military exercises over Phoenix and analyzed traffic patterns in Wilmington, North Carolina. BuzzFeed News science reporter Peter Aldhous found all of these hidden planes by developing a machine-learning algorithm. Read more about how he did it here. As the US opioid epidemic gets worse, a nasty, high-stakes debate has erupted about how doctors should treat people with chronic pain. Reacting to new guidelines from the CDC, some doctors have swiftly taken these patients off of opioid medications, throwing them into horrible withdrawal symptoms and leading some to consider suicide. ""Underneath the animus, almost everyone agrees, is not so much a clash between the doctors and patients,"" writes BuzzFeed News science reporter Dan Vergano. ""It’s a medical system, built on 15-minute doctor visits that end with a prescription, that doesn’t effectively treat pain."" In 2016, US lifespan dropped for the second year in a row, to 78.6 years, down from 78.7 in 2015 and 78.9 in 2014. The drop is striking because elderly people in the US are actually living longer than they used to. But young people are dying of drug overdoses in staggering numbers. “Basically, good things are happening to old people, while bad things are happening to young ones,” one expert told BuzzFeed News. In October, a shooter killed dozens of people in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. As the chart above shows, deaths from mass shootings (defined as single attacks in a public place in which four or more people were shot and killed) are on the rise. But because these events are still relatively rare, there hasn't been much research on how to prevent them. Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

Player decisions on how natural resources are utilized in crafting their cultures will affect weather, natural disasters and global warming. Players will manage new power and consumable resources with fellow world leaders to try and to keep the balance between humanity and nature from bringing about disaster. The expansion also adds the World Congress, which brings with it a new diplomatic victory condition.

UBS,"Earths natural resources largely determine the global economys ebb and flow. As such, the effects of climate change continue to cause concern among economists and environmentalists alike. In 2018, professors William Nordhaus and Paul Romer won the Nobel Prize in Economics for their work exploring how climate change affects economic stability. Ultimately, the pairs research found the phenomena to be closely linked. The case for investment in sustainable ventures is clear: Without such commitments, both the planet and the global economic ecosystem will suffer. Sustainable investments may jump start the slow process of changing consumer habits. Below, we examine the economy-boosting benefits of environmentally friendly business models and how sustainable investment plays an important role. Rolling the DICE As part of Nordhaus research, he developed an economic model called Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model DICE. The acronym, he notes, acknowledges that ignoring climate change is a gamble with severe economic and environmental costs. The DICE model examines expenses related to crop failures, flooding, and other natural disasters. It considers the threat and frequency of environmental damage, as well as the economic harm associated with carbon emissions. The long story short: Climate change has potential to wreak havoc upon the global economy. Nordhaus research helped shape the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (PICC)s recent report. The findings have attracted attention from policymakers and economists worldwide. Preventing severe consequences of climate change is a matter of enacting strict environmental regulations and quickly. The UNs report says that such regulation on an international scale has no documented historic precedent. As one part of a solution at scale, Nordhaus and Romer have proposed that governments enact a global carbon tax. Earlier in 2018, at the UBS Nobel Perspectives Live! event in Shanghai, economist and 2007 Nobel Laureate Eric S. Maskin supported this notion. Climate change is not a problem that is going to take care of itself, says Maskin. Some progress has been made toward reducing [carbon] emissions. But not nearly enough... A carbon tax forces people and companies to pay directly for the damage theyre creating. Government action is, however, historically a process that moves at a snails pace time the planet doesnt have to waste. This is why private and institutional investment in environmental ventures is part of a realistic long-term plan to combat climate change. We must learn to do more with less Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, echoes Maskins sentiment that urgent action is no longer optional. We have been borrowing resources from future generations in order to raise our living standards today, Donovan says. Environmental constraints on economic growth are becoming increasingly visible whether that is the destructive power of natural disasters or simply a lack of resource. We must learn to do more with less, Donovan continues. That requires innovation and productivity. It also requires a climate where the existing way of doing things is challenged. Sustainable models: Saving the environment, boosting the economy Thankfully, a number of organizations are working to build sustainable business models both from an environmental and economic perspective. These smaller-scale initiatives can have major impact from the ground up. Ambri is a revolutionary battery technology founded by Dr. Donald Sadoway, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a UBS Global Visionary. Dr. Sadoway created the liquid metal battery based on his research with electrochemical processes. Ambris products are intended to reduce societys reliance upon the traditional power grid. Ambri hopes to bring a renewable energy source to the masses. The idea is to have a battery that is robust and long-lived, and ultimately very cheap, says Dr. Sadoway in a video for UBS. And so, I conceived of this device ultimately, we want to have something about the size of a ten-meter shipping container that would have a capacity to service 100 American homes. Image: VELAFRICA, UBS Velafrica, created by UBS Global Visionary Paolo Richter, is another company that blends economic growth with environmental progress. The organization collects and refurbishes bicycles and delivers them to rural areas of Africa. The bikes provide an efficient, affordable, and sustainable method of transportation that can help lift people out of poverty. Velafricas bicycles provide people in underserved areas with transportation and access to resources like food, water, and education. Today, the company has distributed more than 180,000 bikes in places like Ghana, Gambia, Madagascar, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast. A recent study found that more than 80% of institutional investors are interested in customizable sustainable investments. Continued investment in organizations like Ambri and Velafrica may help ensure both environmental and economic benefits for future generations to come. Luckily, investors have expressed increasing commitment to sustainable ventures. A recent study found that more than 80% of institutional investors are interested in customizable sustainable investments. Donovan has seen this very trend firsthand at UBS. UBS clients tend to have a long-term view and often consider future generations, notes Donovan. It is natural that they will have a particular interest in managing the issues of the environmental credit crunch. The value of investments can go down as well as up. Your capital and income is at risk. ESG/Sustainable Investing Considerations: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and in some instances integrate the analysis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process and portfolio. Strategies across geographies and styles approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio managers ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of ESG or sustainable investments may be lower or higher than a portfolio where such factors are not considered by the portfolio manager. Because sustainability criteria can exclude some investments, investors may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as investors that do not use such criteria. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Karl Spencer Image caption Hurricane Harvey caused damage estimated at around $125bn in Texas last year The US experienced a record year of losses from fires, hurricanes and other weather related disasters in 2017, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). Total losses amounted to $306bn the agency said, over $90bn more than the previous record set in 2005. Last year saw 16 separate events with losses exceeding $1bn, including Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Noaa confirmed that 2017 was the third warmest year on record for the US. Last year witnessed two Category 4 hurricanes make landfall in the States. Hurricane Harvey produced major flooding as a result of a storm surge and extreme rain. Nearly 800,000 people needed help. Researchers have already shown that climate change increased the likelihood of the observed rainfall by a factor of at least 3.5. Noaa says the total costs of the Harvey event were $125bn, which is second only to Hurricane Katrina in terms of costs over the 38 years the record has been maintained. Hurricane Irma was a Category 5 storm for the longest period on record. Rain gauges in Nederland, Texas, recorded 1,539mm, the largest ever recorded for a single event in the mainland US. Hurricanes Irma and Maria cost $50bn and $90bn respectively. As well as hurricanes, there were devastating fires in western states, particularly in California. While last winter and spring saw heavy rains in the region that alleviated a long-term drought, the resulting boom in vegetation created abundant wildfire fuel. Fires in both the north and south of California meant hundreds of thousands of residents had to be evacuated from their homes. The report from Noaa says that across the US, the overall cost of these fires was $18bn, tripling the previous wildfire cost record. Noaa confirmed that in overall temperature terms, it was the third warmest year in the US since records began in 1895, behind 2012 and 2016. ""In the general picture the warming [of the] US over the long term is related to the larger scale warming we have seen on the global scale,"" said Deke Arndt, chief of Noaa's monitoring section. ""The US will have a lot more year to year variability so that it bounces up and down depending on prevailing weather regimes. But the long term signal is tied with long term warming."" The eastern US has been experiencing an extreme cold snap, leading some, such as US president Donald Trump, to query the impact of global warming. Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2017 End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump However, Noaa scientists were quick to point out that cold spells do occur even if the overall temperature trend is rising. ""We do live in a warming world but we still have very cold poles and we still have the same weather systems that pull cold air away from those poles and down to where we live,"" said Deke Arndt ""We are still going to see blue blobs on the map, but when they average out with the pinks and red that we see over the course of the year, we end up seeing a pretty warm year."" While Monday's temperature data from Noaa deals only with the US, last week the European Weather Centre said that globally, 2017 was in fact the second warmest on record. According to those figures, 2017 was the warmest year on record without the influence of the El Niño weather phenomenon. The calculation was derived from millions of observations from land, sea and space, combined with models.

On the island of Svalbard, the city of Longyearbyen repeatedly experienced mean monthly temperatures more than 6 degrees C above the long-term mark. In November last year the World Meteorological Organization issued a provisional bulletin stating that 2017 was likely the second or third warmest year on record. That prediction will be clarified in the coming days and weeks as various agencies around the world publish their data for the full year. There are usually some small differences between the datasets held by the different national bodies based mainly on their coverage of the polar regions and and in their estimates of sea-surface temperature.","Fires, hurricanes and other weather and climate disasters last year cost the US around $306bn in losses.",2018-01-08T18:05:15Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Most expensive year on record for US natural disasters,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42608161,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/160D1/production/_99512309_gettyimages-841445032-1.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Natural disasters,1
Richard C. Keller,"President Trump provoked outrage on Twitter and in the media in mid-September with his tweets that denied the death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria in 2017 and blamed Democrats for artificially elevating it. Measuring the mortality in epidemic or emergency periods has long been controversial. Authorities often deny reports of high mortality because they seek to avoid being blamed for mismanagement. But all too often, the reports are indeed accurate—and understanding why is essential to helping save lives in future disasters. During the brutal Chicago heat wave of July 1995, for example, Mayor Richard M. Daley’s office rejected the medical examiner’s death toll. A subsequent study eventually confirmed the medical examiner’s figure, indeed finding that mortality was even higher than initially reported. When unprecedented extreme heat consumed France for two weeks in August 2003, the country’s health ministry and prime minister initially denied reports of thousands of heat-related deaths. Yet again, an official study produced by France’s national medical and public health agency confirmed that nearly 15,000 French men and women had died from the heat. The president appears to argue that the figure of 3,000 deaths in Puerto Rico—confirmed by independent studies from George Washington University and Harvard —is false because initial reports indicated just a handful of deaths and the larger number appeared “a long time later.” Yet by definition, disaster mortality reporting takes time. The accepted method for estimating disaster deaths involves a calculation of what epidemiologists call excess mortality, which involves subtracting the average number of deaths that would have occurred in the absence of a disaster from the number of reported deaths during and in the aftermath of the disaster. Scientists can then attribute any excess deaths to the disaster itself. While the calculation is simple in principle, it cannot be performed overnight. These excess mortality estimates often include deaths that are due to the disaster yet are indirectly linked. For example, rates of drowning go up during heat waves, as many inexperienced swimmers take to the water to find relief. In the case of hurricane reporting, indirect deaths include not only those killed by flooding or being struck with debris, but also those who died in the storm’s aftermath as a result of power failures, a lack of potable water, disease linked to flooding and contamination, and an inability to access health care. These deaths are inextricably connected to the disaster that precipitated them since they would not have occurred in the absence of extreme weather. More importantly, effective management of disasters can minimize both direct and indirect deaths. The federal government cannot alter weather patterns, but it can help communities prepare for disaster and rebuild in the aftermath. When an administration is negligent and mismanages the response, it can cost lives. For nearly a year after Hurricane Maria, parts of Puerto Rico remained without power, straining the island’s capacity to provide secure water, food, and health care to its population. The Trump administration has contributed to the problem, awarding rebuilding contracts to inexperienced and unqualified contractors. This has exacerbated the difficulties of recovery, delayed the ability to account for disaster-related deaths, and elevated the death toll linked to the hurricane’s devastation. As the East Coast braces for the peak of another hurricane season, and Hurricane Florence wreaks havoc on the Carolinas, it is critical to our disaster preparation efforts that we acknowledge their potential for destruction. Denying death tolls trivializes disasters and discounts the value of human lives. Contrary to the president’s assertions, natural causes did not kill Hurricane Maria’s victims; vulnerability to disaster and a delayed response did. And a political party did not invent these figures to make the president “look as bad as possible.” Scientists calculated them to establish the truth of a disaster’s human toll.",Downplaying the casualties from natural disasters undermines future preparations -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2018-09-24T16:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Trump's Irresponsible Denial of Puerto Rico's Hurricane Deaths,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/trumps-irresponsible-denial-of-puerto-ricos-hurricane-deaths/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/93CD4EB7-0B1A-4557-A0E65330EB5E0BDB.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,Natural disasters,1
Associated Press,"(BERLIN) — German insurance company Munich Re says the Northern California wildfire that killed dozens of people and burned down the town of Paradise was the world’s costliest single natural disaster in 2018.
The reinsurance giant said on Tuesday that the November fire caused overall losses of $16.5 billion. The company said some $12.5 billion in losses were insured.
The firestorm destroyed thousands of homes and other structures.
Munich Re said losses from all natural disasters reached $160 billion last year, above the inflation-adjusted average of $140 billion for the last 30 years but below 2017’s hurricane-driven high of $350 billion.
Board member Torsten Jeworrek said increasing wildfires in California appear linked to climate change.
He was quoted saying that “action is urgently needed on building codes and land use to help prevent losses.

KAYA LATERMAN,"As towns along the Florida Panhandle start to assess the damage from Hurricane Michael and plan their next steps, homeowners in Long Island offer a cautionary tale of how natural disasters can leave a different type of debris after storm waters recede: endless paperwork, unfinished homes, displaced families, foreclosures, overworked contractors and caseworkers, miscommunication, suspected fraud and massive debt. “All I ever wanted to do was help people,” Mr. Lawrence said. Around 30 homeowners on Long Island have estimated that Turnkey, Mr. Lawrence’s company, took about $4 million in federal grant awards for jobs that were not completed. Credit Kaya Laterman The day after Sandy hit New York, the Bacigalupos, who had evacuated, returned to Island Park to assess the damage. Like most of the homes in this small village in Nassau County, their three-bedroom ranch had been completely ravaged. Although the house was still standing, every room had flooded. I was screaming, hysterically crying, Ms. Bacigalupo said. The neighborhood looked like a war zone, Mr. Bacigalupo said. Emergency personnel conducted search-and-rescue missions. Police officers, firefighters and volunteers from across the country worked tirelessly to clean up debris, including boats in the middle of the street. Despite the devastation, the community pulled together. Ms. Bacigalupo said workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, local officials and nonprofits like Long Island Cares, as well as the Salvation Army and American Red Cross, distributed water, food, clothing and household goods immediately. Owners of local stores handed out gift cards and vouchers. The Village of Island Park paid for trash haulers. The Bacigalupos were awarded $149,000 from their flood insurance policy. They cobbled together an additional $71,000 from savings and Mr. Bacigalupos 401(k) to renovate.

Catie Keck,"As further evidence that were all trapped in an increasingly surreal waking nightmare, Vice President Mike Pence tweeted a photo-op on Friday of himself with a sheriffs deputy whose uniform prominently sported a patch for QAnon, the elaborate, pro-Donald Trump conspiracy theory with 4chan roots. The tweet has since been deleted. The photo was flagged on Twitter by Right Wing Watchs Jared Holt, who noted the patchs resemblance to one currently available on Amazon that reads Question The Narrative. Before it was scrubbed from Twitter, the tweet was originally shared Friday from the official White House account for the vice president, which later re-posted similar images of the vice president and local law enforcement officials without the deputy with the QAnon patch. The post coincided with the vice presidents visit to Florida. BuzzFeed News reported Friday that the original post was taken down minutes after the outlet contacted both the office of the vice president as well as the White House for comment about the image. Per BuzzFeed News: An official at the Vice Presidents Office told BuzzFeed News the image was deleted from Pences account after the patch was pointed out to staff. The official added that the image was taken down so as not to draw attention to the baseless conspiracy theory. QAnon refers to a Pizzagate-like conspiracy theory that centers around a purported U.S. government official with high-level security clearance identified as Q. QAnon is a sprawling rabbit hole of bizarre and baseless claims that deal in everything from a child sex trafficking ring to government-directed lasers that masquerade as natural disasters. QAnon conspiracy theory communities have been banned from Reddit, and Apple reportedly pulled a QAnon-centered alerts app from its App Store in September. Several outlets have identified the deputy sporting the patch as a distinguished veteran with the Broward Sheriffs Office in Florida. Veda Coleman-Wright, a spokesperson for the Broward Sheriffs Office, told the Miami New Times that the patch was not authorized and that the matter [would] be addressed immediately.

Ben Paynter,"Several years ago, one of the eventual founders of One Concern nearly died in a tragic flood. Today, the company specializes in using artificial intelligence to predict how natural disasters are unfolding in real time on a city-block-level basis, in order to help disaster responders save as many lives as possible.As Fast Company wrote in November 2018:
“In 2014, Stanford student structural engineer Ahmad Wani was visiting family in his native Kashmir when a catastrophic flood struck. The rising waters stranded him and his family for seven days without food or water, during which they watched their neighbor’s home collapse, killing everyone inside.
After this horrifying experience, Wani was struck by just how disorganized the emergency response was. “There is no science behind how people should be rescued,” he says. “Disaster response is really random.”
To fix that, One Concern debuted Flood Concern in late 2018. It creates map-based visualizations of where water surges may hit hardest, up to five days ahead of an impending storm. For cities, that includes not just time-lapse breakdowns of how the water will rise, how fast it could move, and what direction it will be flowing, but also what structures will get swamped or washed away, and how differing mitigation efforts–from levy building to dam releases–will impact each scenario. It’s the winner of Fast Company’s 2019 World Changing Ideas Awards in the AI and Data category.
[Image: One Concern]
So far, Flood Concern has been retroactively tested against events like Hurricane Harvey to show that it could have predicted what areas would be most impacted well ahead of the storm. The company, which was founded in Silicon Valley in 2015, started with one of that region’s pressing threats: earthquakes. It’s since earned contracts with cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Cupertino, as well as private insurance companies.
Either way, a live field test is imminent as extreme weather events become more common. According to the National Centers for Environmental Information, the U.S. has experienced 241 severe weather events with damages exceeding $1 billion. In 2019, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report ranked extreme weather like floods and storms its number one most pressing concern.
One Concern’s first offering, dubbed Seismic Concern, takes existing information from satellite images and building permits to figure out what kind of ground structures are built on, and what might happen if they started shaking. If a big one hits, the program can extrapolate from the epicenter to suggest the likeliest places for destruction, and then adjust as more data from things like 911 calls and social media gets factored in.

Flood Concern works similarly, but with a more dynamic set of variables. It includes soil saturation and building stability estimates but also how topography will affect potential runoff. Then it adds in factors like National Weather Service forecasts and U.S. Geological Survey data about nearby river or tidal flows to create a model that adjusts as the situation changes. “We look at how things change over space and time,” says One Concern cofounder and CTO Nicole Hu.
That allows emergency crews to figure out ahead of time what roads may still passable, and plan evacuation routes accordingly. The company can also overlay maps with existing demographic data to highlight what areas of a city might be especially in danger if people there don’t evacuate. It can also pinpoint crucial infrastructure like water tanks, electric plants, and hospitals that will need protecting–and run if/then hypotheticals about how to do that.
So far, the state of Arizona has signed on as a public partner. One Concern remains in discussion with other cities and is working with international development groups for how to affordably apply its services in developing countries. It’s also building another simulator, this time for wildfires. “For too long, we have only focused on how we can use technology to make things more convenient,” Hu says. “We want to bring innovative tech into the space to help [people] make better decisions, to help make those life-saving decisions.”","Flood Concern can help cities model flood damage and prepare better flood responses.

Dell Cameron,"The FCC chairman has been formally accused of dodging and deceiving the federal lawmakers charged with the oversight of his agency. In a letter sent Wednesday, House Democrats said the chairman, Ajit Pai, has been avoiding important questions sent by members of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, the legislative group tasked with reviewing and supervising the Federal Communications Commission. Pai has repeatedly failed to respond to questions sent by letter to his office, the lawmakers said. More than two dozen such letters were resent to Pai on Wednesday. Some of the questions were first sent as recently as last month, while others are dated as far back as March 2017. The topics vary widely, addressing issues ranging from the unauthorized use of cellphone surveillance equipment to the maintenance of wireless networks after natural disasters. Specifically, Pai was admonished over his “lack of candor,” a term that in federal parlance roughly translates to “withholding information that should be disclosed,” which is to say, the chairman was not accused of lying outright. In the colloquial vernacular, however, fluent to those of us in the wide world outside the Capitol complex, where gradations of sincerity are less finely parsed, Pai’s alleged inadequate frankness might be characterized more expressly as “lying by omission.” “We are concerned,” the lawmakers wrote, “that you have been unable to give complete responses to verbal questions, questions for the record, or oversight letters from our members,” adding: “We take our oversight responsibilities very seriously, and we expect witnesses before the Subcommittee and recipients of our letters to treat their responses the same way.” The FCC did not respond to a request for comment. Your responses to our requests, in the instances when we receive them, do not meet the very commitment you made to us The letter notes that earlier this Congress, Pai was all about trumpeting the value of congressional oversight, saying it was integral to keep lawmakers abreast of “what the FCC is doing.” He had also vowed to be “responsive to all congressional inquiries,” insofar as the law and rules of the Commission require. “To date, your responses to our requests, in the instances when we receive them, do not meet the very commitment you made to us, and we hope that will change,” the Democrats wrote. The letter was signed by the Energy and Commerce Committee’s ranking member, Frank Pallone, Jr., and Communications and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member Mike Doyle, as well as: Rep. Peter Welch, Rep. Yvette Clarke, Rep. Dave Loebsack, Rep. Raul Ruiz, Rep. Debbie Dingell, Rep. Bobby Rush, Rep. Anna Eshoo, Rep. Eliot Engel, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, Rep. Doris Matsui, and Rep. Jerry McNerney—all Democrats. “Oversight of the agencies within our jurisdiction is one of the most important responsibilities of the Committee,” the lawmakers wrote.

Inside, the exhibit features nine galleries teeming with marine life. Large tanks with grandiose displays host more than 115 marine species, including stingrays and sea turtles. The dozen shark species are the centerpieces of the aquarium, though. Many of them, including sand tigers, sandbar, and nurse sharks are native to East Coast waters. Jon Forrest Dohlin, director of the New York Aquarium, hopes the exhibit can help visitors become more aware of the crucial role these creatures play in the world’s ocean—including right in their own backyards. “This wildlife exists paradoxically surrounded by 20 million people,” Dohlin told Earther. “They’re ecologically so important to the health and habitats all over the globe and they need our help.” The new exhibit—which took four years to build—debunks myths about the dangers sharks pose and teaching aquarium-goers about the crucial role these creatures play in ocean food chains. Visitors also learn about shark habitats, different stages of shark development, and can even get hands-on with the toothy creature’s chompers in an interactive display. Visitors can reach out and touch models of different kinds of shark teeth—not all sharks wield serrated cutting teeth—without fear of getting bitten. By the end of the exhibit, aquarium visitors are reminded of the many severe threats sharks face. One hundred million sharks are killed every year around the world due to shark fin demand, long-line fishing, and net entanglement, according to Dohlin. A number of these sharks threats are bycatch, casualties of fishermen seeking other species. The exhibit urges visitors to make small changes, such as recycling and consuming sustainable seafood, in order to protect sharks and other diverse marine life. “To lose 100 million of these animals is a catastrophic conservation challenge we really have to rise to collectively all over the world,” Dohlin said. The $158 million exhibit is a huge milestone in the aquarium’s recovery after Hurricane Sandy ravaged it in 2012. The shark exhibit was set to break ground just days before the superstorm hit, flooding aquarium exhibits and offices. The exhibit’s opening was put on hold. New safety precautions like flood doors were put in place in order to protect aquarium animals from any future natural disasters. Almost six years after Hurricane Sandy, recovery work continues on the rest of the Aquarium’s 14-acre campus, more than half of which remains closed.

STEVEN HYDEN,"“Big mood” (or simply “mood,” if you’re not into hyperbole) has been thriving as social-media slang for years now, usually appearing in tandem with a funny image, video or animated GIF. It’s meant to convey a relatable feeling, with maximum irreverence, as if to say: Here is a visual approximation of my soul right now. The avatars in these images are rarely related to anything about who their posters are; each is just an idealized version of a heightened self, a meme as self-portrait. The “big mood” of an insolent cheerleader can indicate any number of feelings: “I’m awesome,” or “I’m happily deluded about my own awesomeness,” or “I’m trying in spite of everything.” Some moods evoke eternal swagger: News that Rihanna is possibly ending a relationship, or doing virtually anything else, is reliably a big mood. Others signify of-the-moment insouciance: An obscene gesture from Villanelle, one of the protagonists of the popular BBC America series “Killing Eve,” is a big mood. The best ones are outlandish and obscure: An old photo of Carrie Fisher in a trash can, holding a bottle of wine, screams big mood. It’s that viral tweet about the young cheerleader, though, that has been credited by internet-culture sites like The Daily Dot with finally bringing “big mood” to its mainstream saturation point, making the phrase fair game for use by established media, moderately hip parents and corporate brands. Cummings is a big reason you may have noticed a lot more things being categorized as big moods lately: Blake Lively’s testy encounter with photographers at the Met Gala (as described by E! News), or a Japanese animated series on Netflix (as described by Elle), or a video of two lynxes yelling at each other (as described by Vice), or an important win by the Boston Red Sox (as described by the Boston Red Sox). Nothing is so small or inconsequential that it can’t inspire the internet’s outsize passions. We would rather our moods be big in this figurative sense (rich, vibrant, specific, intensely personal) than the literal one (collective, shared, part of a system that acts upon us). Social media emboldens this feeling of specialness. Who else but you would think to sum up a personal mood with, say, a photo of an exhausted squirrel, splayed out on a railing outside an office window? But of course hundreds of people recently favorited a tweet doing exactly that, offering replies like “same” and “she is me and I is her.” There’s no avoiding these emotional contagions. Being inundated with so many moods can affect how we see everything around us, unleashing complex waves of uplift or tumult. If you scan social media these days, it’s hard not to conclude that the overriding sentiments — the inescapable moods that hang over all our heads like stagnant humidity — are those of annoyance, consternation and abstract misery. Not just about the day’s news or the latest grand controversy, but about everything, in general. These feelings can feed into one another, influencing the collective mood as profoundly, and maybe as adversely, as world-historic news events and natural disasters and national humiliations. Take a step back, and you see something like a rat-king of feeling, the biggest mood of all.","No end of cash and effort is spent trying to divine Americans’ emotional state.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Imagine a future where the United States is experiencing multiple Katrina or Sandy-like storms at the same time—all while wildfires rage in the West. Right now, the Department of Defense is in no way ready to handle that, said Francesco Femia, the co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security, a nonpartisan think tank made up of military and security experts. “Though we’re capable of managing a lot of natural disasters, a future with runaway climate change is one that’s going to become very difficult to manage even here at home,” Femia told Earther. Luckily, the Department of Defense is one of the few federal agencies that still treats climate change as a threat under President Donald Trump. On Monday, the president signed a $716 billion defense bill that Congress passed earlier this summer. It includes plans to prepare current and future military bases and military facilities for “environmental condition projections,” such as sea level rise and increased flooding. There’s also an entire section devoted to the rapidly-melting Arctic, which Russia and China are eyeing to take over. “The Department of Defense is witnessing and really on the frontlines of a lot of these changes,” Femia said. “They’ve got military bases across the world, including at sea level. They’re seeing the effects of flooding. They’re seeing the effects of wildfires and what that does to their own capabilities and priorities.” Apparently, ramping up global military efforts is one way to get the president to support climate legislation. “This bill just starts to scratch the surface of what kind of capabilities the military will need as the Arctic melts.” Sure, this bill doesn’t explicitly call out climate change by name once, but that doesn’t diminish its value. The bill lays out plans to adapt military infrastructure around the world to our changing environment and climate. That’s in line with last year’s defense spending bill, for which former President Barack Obama had laid the groundwork. The new bill requires Secretary of Defense James Mattis to prepare a report on a new Arctic strategy by June 1, 2019. This means taking a look at the sea vessels the U.S. has for this region—like icebreakers, of which the U.S. has just two ( Russia has 40 ). The bill requires that the U.S. keep at least six icebreakers starting in fiscal year 2029. Another important piece, said Femia, is the bill’s attention to training for future operations in the Arctic. “There’s an expectation of there needing to be greater capacities for search and rescues in the Arctic as we get more commercial activity and more activity, in general, in the Arctic, and we’re not really prepared to handle that level of activity,” Femia said. “This bill just starts to scratch the surface of what kind of capabilities the military will need as the Arctic melts.” This bill comes after months of back and forth between members of Congress and the Department of Defense on the importance of highlighting climate change’s roles in reports and assessments the department puts out. More than 40 House representatives in both parties sent Mattis a letter in July expressing concern that an assessment had not mentioned climate change outright. That followed a January letter from over 100 lawmakers concerning Trump’s National Security Strategy, which also failed to mention climate change. The security of military bases abroad and here in the U.S. are at risk as sea levels begin to rise and flooding becomes more imminent. The Union of Concerned Scientists published a report in 2016 that found bases along the East and Gulf Coast—where many military members live with their families—could see flooding 100 times a year by midcentury if sea level rises even moderately. Members of Congress are not scared to discuss their concerns around climate change and national security. Neither is the Department of Defense. As for the president? He’s got a long way to go.","Imagine a future where the United States is experiencing multiple Katrina or Sandy-like storms at the same time—all while wildfires rage in the West.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Less than six months after launching in France, a dockless bike-sharing service is calling it quits in the country, due to what it characterized as “mass destruction.” The company, Gobee, told The Guardian that over a thousand bikes were stolen in France, with 3,200 damaged and 6,500 needing repairs. “Over the months of December and January, the mass destruction of our fleet has become the new entertainment of underaged individuals,” said Gobee. A shitstorm of ruination seems to be the default outcome for dockless bike-sharing services, and Gobee is no exception to the rule. Which poses the question: Will humans ever not wreak havoc on a dockless bike-sharing service? Around the world, bike-sharing startups are struggling with this reality. In China, there are heaps of thousands of discarded bikes. Dockless bike-sharing service Wukong Bikes shut down after it lost 90 percent of its bikes in just five months—the company forgot to equip its bikes with GPS. In Britain, Obike had to terminate its operations in several London locations after bikes obstructed highways and sidewalks, and it faced backlash in Australia for similar reasons. And in the US, Spin is fighting with the Department of Transportation to get its dockless bikes operational in New York City—but people with access to the service in Seattle have already complained about a wonky user experience. Finally, while it’s not a bike-sharing service, free-reign access to bikes at Google has led to hundreds of them going missing a week. “It was sad and disappointing to realise that a few individuals could ruin such a beautiful and promising project,” Gobee said, according to The Guardian. “We had to come to the conclusion that it could not be viable and there was no other choice for us than shutting down, nationwide.” Based on the litany of dockless bike-sharing failures, it’s almost as if a service banking on the good faith of humans isn’t a sustainable business plan. It’s inarguably great to try and encourage more people to choose bikes over cars, but the convenience that dockless bike-sharing offers also invites its downfall. Earlier this month, Felix Salmon argued in Wired Ideas that the chaos of dockless bike-sharing services was a necessary disruption to “reveal desire paths, build new ones, and make permanent changes to the warp and weft of the city.” “Dockless bikes provide the perfect tool for navigating wide avenues while still feeling connected to the city,” he wrote, adding that by “getting where they want to go in the easiest and most efficient manner possible, dockless bike riders are effortlessly demonstrating—and creating—exactly what their city needs.” But I’m hard-pressed to find an example of a dockless bike-sharing success story. While it’s possible that city planners will one day be forced to address the problem in the same way they do natural disasters, there’s little evidence of a will to, with the immediate result being increased theft, vandalism, and obstruction. This is not to say that improved access to bikes is a flawed plan. But perhaps leaning too heavily on the premise that people’s good nature will outweigh their laziness or appetite for destruction is a bit misguided. Bike-sharing is fantastic, but dockless is, to date, a goddamn mess.

Ingrid Lunden,"GoFundMe.com has made a name for itself as a wildly successful platform for people to raise awareness virally and collect money for their personal causes, with $5 billion coming from 50 million donors since launching in 2010. More recently, it has been building out a wider presence working with charities.
It is making the latter more official today, with the launch of GoFundMe.org. And alongside this, it’s debuting a new way to donate to larger fundraising efforts by way of GoFundMe.org Causes, which lets people make donations that might go to one of many charities working to support a variety of general causes, initially covering six “evergreen” areas like animal rescue, K-12 classrooms and mental health.
GoFundMe says that the tax-deductible donations that people make on GoFundMe.org will be disbursed to hundreds of verified fundraisers and charities related to the cause.
Together with GoFundMe, we are expanding the benefits of social fundraising and continuing to support some of the most impactful needs within our community with tax-deductible donations, said Yoshi Inoue, CEO of GoFundMe.org. Inoue had previously been legal counsel at GoFundMe, and previous to that had worked at The Life You Can Save, another organization that helps recommend charities for those who want to give but are not sure of what steps to take next.
GoFundMe.org is not exactly new: it is the new name for the Direct Impact Fund, which has been working with GoFundMe since 2017 — and before that, it was working with Crowdrise, which GoFundMe acquired that year — to help pool funding for mass events like natural or man-made disasters, where it helped distribute what got raised to charities helping to address individuals’ needs. It’s an independent, registered 501(c)(3) public charity.
YouCaring, another acquisition GoFundMe has made in its consolidation push in the causes and charitable giving space, had also been a leading platform for larger charitable efforts. At one point, it had the distinction of running the largest fundraising campaign of any kind, on any platform, with the JJ Watts Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund ($37 million raised). Having one platform for GoFundMe to collect for wider causes like this, which in itself is a charity, is a smart move.
The renaming and launch of the Causes element underscores two areas of development for GoFundMe.
First, it’s creating a more formal way for those who want to donate money to charity, but unaware of the best way to go about doing this, to have a more obvious channel for doing this, distinct from the personal causes that are on GoFundMe.
Second, it’s underscoring GoFundMe’s own hope that people do not associate it just with personal fundraising (sometimes with very questionable ends) but also with a wider spirit of giving, and giving back. That is something it has been working on for a while, for example when it partnered with former First Lady Michelle Obama on the Global Girls Alliance.
This is, therefore, more to the spirit of how people sometimes come to platforms like GoFundMe, even if it’s not always what they find there (since the majority of campaigns will be for individuals). That is something that Facebook had capitalised on with its own launch of fundraising options for non-profits on its platform several years ago.
Were dedicated to bringing more people together to support causes they care about, says Raquel Rozas, GoFundMe chief marketing officer. By working with our non-profit arm, GoFundMe.org, were providing people the opportunity to give to one topic theyre passionate about rather than having to pick just one fundraiser to support.","GoFundMe.com has made a name for itself as a wildly successful platform for people to raise awareness virally and collect money for their personal causes, with $5 billion coming from 50 million donors since launching in 2010.

"Anne C. Mulkern, E&E News","Sea-level rise threatens California’s economy 10 times more than recent extreme wildfires or severe earthquakes, according to a major new study.
U.S. Geological Survey researchers and other scientists found that rising seas, combined with storms, will wallop California by the turn of the century, with impacts occurring as early as 2040. The study published in the journal Nature translated physical impacts into socio-economic ones, finding that both the coast and inland areas will face major financial losses.
“The scale of potential impacts by the end of the century is comparable to some of the largest natural disasters in history,” said Patrick Barnard, lead author of the study and a USGS geologist.
The analysis compared the financial hit to Hurricane Katrina: “The economic value of what’s exposed to flooding is on the same order of that event,” he said.
Barnard said the impact from a combined sea-level rise and storm event will be many times greater than the worst natural disasters in California’s history, including the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in the San Francisco area and the 2017 and 2018 wildfires seasons.
By the end of the century, a typical storm could expose about $100 billion in property to damages, he said.
“That’s the kind of thing that could be hitting every single year,” Barnard said.
As many as 600,000 people and $150 billion in property are at risk of coastal flooding by 2100 in the state, which has the world’s fifth-largest economy. That loss is equivalent to 6 percent of California’s gross domestic product.
Adaptation costs could top $1 trillion by the end of the 21st century. The risk is even greater if there’s rapid melting of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, which could cause about 10 feet of sea-level rise by 2100.
Damages are expected to occur well before the turn of the century, Barnard said.
The seas are likely to rise by about 10 inches by 2050 based on median projections. That doesn’t sound like a lot, but as so much in California is built at sea level, even a small change can cause flooding.
“The exposure by 2040, especially if you include storms, increases by a factor of seven,” Barnard said. “Across California we’re talking about tens of billions of dollars of property exposed just over the next couple decades.”
The rate of cliff retreat will also roughly double by the end of the century, he said. That’s because sea-level rise causes waves to hit the bottom of cliffs, weakening their bases and making the tops unstable. Multimillion-dollar cliff-top homes will be at risk.
New governor must decide path forward
New California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and the state Legislature are grappling with how to deal with sea-level rise. In recent years, the Legislature has steered away from any stringent mandates, other than telling cities they must incorporate adaptation to sea-level rise in their planning.
The California Coastal Commission—which works to preserve the state’s beaches and coastal access and oversees development along 1,100 miles of coast—has wrestled with beach cities and residents over policies, including those governing sea walls. Environmental groups argue walls won’t allow the beach to migrate inland as waters rise.
Spokeswoman Noaki Schwartz said the coastal commission was reviewing the study.
“Per our sea-level rise guidance, we will always use the best available science,” she said.
The commission has said it plans to release new guidance early this year on sea-level rise in residential areas. A draft version outlined steps for managed retreat, or removing homes to preserve the dry beach as waters rise (Climatewire, Dec. 7, 2018). But the agency got significant pushback from cities. Schwartz said there was no update on when a new version would be released.
Mandy Sackett, California policy coordinator with the Surfrider Foundation, said state and local planners need to consider the study as they make planning rules.
“The decisions that we’re making now will play out as to the impact we see in California,” she said. “What we’re building and not building, and where we’re zoning and planning now is really going to forecast how devastating sea-level rise is to our state.”
If development is allowed in a hazardous area, it will still be there as seas rise, she said. Where development is allowed also affects decisions about sea walls.
“Right now we’re deciding which beaches to save and which ones to allow to disappear with our permitting and planning decisions,” Sackett said.
Storms and sea-level rise
The USGS analysis is one of the first to look at the combination of sea-level rise and storms. Higher oceans increase damage from storms because so many houses and other buildings along the coast are built right at sea level.
“It doesn’t take much to dramatically impact,” Barnard said.
Compared with coastal flooding from sea-level rise only, the study predicts, storms will increase the exposure of people and buildings by as much as seven times by 2040.
“It’s very important research showing the connection between storms and sea-level rise,” said Deborah Halberstadt, executive director of the California Ocean Protection Council, which helped fund the USGS study. “It is really a critical missing piece that we haven’t given enough attention to.”
The combination of sea-level rise and storms “ends up resulting in significantly greater impacts far inland from what people are anticipating,” she added. “That is very important information that this study gleaned.”
The Ocean Protection Council makes recommendations to the Legislature and the governor based on the most recent science. After the study, OPC plans to provide help to local governments, Halberstadt said, for pilot projects that explore new approaches to address sea-level rise.
She said the group is not looking for “black or white” solutions, such as forcing communities “to think about managed retreat or nothing.”
“There’s a wide spectrum of solutions and a wide spectrum of approaches,” she said.
Halberstadt said she didn’t foresee the state putting in place a more prescriptive approach to sea-level rise.
State Sen. Bob Wieckowski (D) plans to push for more adaptation policies. He introduced a bill, S.B. 13, that would create the position of chief officer of climate adaptation and resilience in the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research.
Wieckowski leads a state Senate budget subcommittee on the environment. On April 4, the panel will hear about coastal climate adaptation efforts from several state and local agencies.
“We are at a critical period here in California,” Wieckowski said. “Several recent climate reports paint a stark picture of extreme upheaval if state and global leaders do not act with urgency to cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to our changing climate. We must act with clarity and move aggressively to meet these challenges and build a more sustainable future.”

Aarian Marshall,"The Bay Area is blessed; the Bay Area is cursed. This is how Gabriel Metcalf, the director of the urban policy think tank San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association—aka SPUR—puts it, more or less. “We really have everything we need to successfully solve our problems,” he says. “What we’re missing is a kind of civic will to act at the necessary scale.” This month, SPUR embarks on a three-year project to create a regional strategy for the country’s richest area—and its most unequal. The strategy goes far beyond the standard 5, 10, or 20 years for such plans. SPUR is projecting all the way to 2070. And this month, the group released a report on “future scenarios”. They’re an attempt to answer: What happens if nothing in the Bay Area changes over the next half century? What happens if everything does? “It’s too easy to create a massive dystopian document, that the future is all going to be terrible,” says Allison Arieff, SPUR’s editorial director. “This is an effort, in earnest, to look for the positive.” It’s also an interesting way to get at the area’s main gifts and problems, most of which can be summed up in a few statistics. The region, which stretches from Sonoma County in the north, Contra Costa and Alameda Counties in the east, San Francisco in the west, and San Mateo County in the south, put out $748 billion in gross domestic product last year. Its economy is growing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the US. More than half of Bay Area residents have a bachelor’s degree or more. The median home resold for $712,000 at the beginning of this year, up 11 percent from the year previous. Just 4 percent of the region’s housing is subsidized. High fees and a tortuous permitting progress make it hard to build more. Thanks to increasing traffic congestion, commute times are now at record levels, while residents are taking far fewer public transit trips than they did 25 years ago. Projections show middle-wage jobs in the Bay Area will account for just 22 percent of the job growth in the area between 2010 and 2020—meaning the share of middle-wage jobs has declined compared to low- and high-wage ones. So you don’t need a stack of paper to know that fixing the place by 2070 comes down to the economy. That, plus housing, transportation, and land use. Oh, and the variables that local policy alone cannot control: climate change, natural disasters, whatever the heck is going on in Washington. It’s all very complicated, which is why SPUR’s scenarios make for a useful rubric. Of course, it’s pitched toward the organization’s own policy views: that increased economic prosperity can be created hand-in-hand with the tech community, and that building market-rate housing is one path out of the affordability crunch. Let’s start with what happens if nothing changes. SPUR calls this scenario “Gated Utopia”. Service jobs are automated, and the people who used to do this work have moved away. Schools are good because there’s only rich people here now. Public transit is OK, but only in the urban core, and most of the area’s wealthy residents rely on private transportation, like personal autonomous vehicles. The area is packed with random millionaires—former middle class folk who happened to buy homes when prices were low. Safe, but homogenous; successful, but only for some. “If the current trends continue, that’s where we end up,” says Metcalf. Scenario two: “Bunker Bay Area”, a place marked by economic decline and social exclusion, meaning people are bereft of opportunities because of their income or education level, or because of the color of their skin. The gradual concentration of wealth in the hands of the few is masked, for a time, by the area’s booming economy. But as homelessness becomes more and more common, money leaks out of the public safety net and away from job training programs. The gated community is the architectural signature, as the wealthy use their own resources to protect themselves. Low-income people rely on an informal economy to survive. Three: “Rust Belt West”, a place dominated by anti-business sentiment, economic decline, and social inclusion, meaning politicians and institutions work hard to support workers, the middle class, and the poor. Informal co-ops have taken over for municipal garbage collection and public transit, while hospitals and pharmacies lay mostly fallow. “As companies left, there were no business leaders to contest the policy choices, which over time became more and more extreme,” SPUR explains in its report. Finally, the best of all possible worlds: “A New Social Compact”, a place where the economy booms and social inclusion thrives. A single regional transportation agency—right now, there are eight in the Bay Area—has extended service into lower-density areas, while reconfiguring roads for walking and scooters. Immigration continues unabated. Smaller, infill homes bloom. The terms are meant to be a starting point for a longer process, one that won’t just be guided by SPUR’s own staff. “Planners are in the middle of this shift in how decisions are made. It’s less top-down, though not fully bottom-up,” says Arieff, referencing Robert Moses ’ highway building by near fiat as the “old model” of city decision making. “Organizations such as ours have to be wide open and receptive and inclusive of as many voices as possible.” She notes SPUR will hold three public listening sessions in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose, to get a sense for where many groups’ priorities lie. 2070 feels far away, but knowing what residents really want it to look like is the first step in getting there.

Peter Kotecki,"Deadly fires have engulfed communities across California in recent days. The Camp Fire in northern California has killed at least 29 people and destroyed more than 6,400 homes, making it the most destructive wildfire in the state's history. Growing at the rate of nearly 80 football fields per minute, the fire burned the entire town of Paradise, which was home to 27,000 people. Meanwhile, the Woolsey Fire near Los Angeles killed two people and forced more than 275,000 people to leave their homes, bringing the total death toll in the state to 31. Another fire, the Hill Fire, has charred over 7 square miles near Los Angeles. The Hill Fire, which was 75% contained as of Monday morning, is one of more than 7,500 fires to have burned across California this year. These fires are part of a trend, as fire season in the western US is getting longer each year. Some fire experts say the concept of seasonal wildfires no longer applies, since dangerous fires can now happen anytime.

On an incoming freshman class that is historically female and remarkably diverse:
When our new Members take the oath, our Congress will be refreshed, and our Democracy will be strengthened by the optimism, idealism and patriotism of this transformative Freshman Class. Working together, we will redeem the promise of the American dream for every family, advancing progress for every community.
On growing income disparity, as the rich grow richer and the rest struggle to keep afloat:
We must end that injustice and restore the publics faith in a better future for themselves and their children. We must be champions of the middle class, and all those who aspire to it because the middle class is the backbone of democracy.
On climate change, an issue that she failed to legislate on the last time she was speaker with disastrous political results:

Claire Reilly,"NASA When Hawaii's Mount Kilauea volcano went into overdrive in May, the world watched as lava erupted from fissures in the Earth and steadily rolled across Hawaii's Big Island, destroying everything in its path. Turns out NASA had a pretty good view of the destruction too. The space agency released satellite imagery, taken on Wednesday, July 25, showing the massive extent of the hot lava flow from Kilauea all the way to the Pacific Ocean. The image shows a long flow of lava (pictured in yellow) snaking across the island and running from fissure 8 on the volcano down to Ahalanui Beach on the island's east. The image also shows the vegetation around the lava flow (shown in red) and clouds above the island (in white). The image was captured by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) radiometer on board NASA's Terra satellite. According to NASA, ASTER is capable of capturing images across 14 spectral bands, from visible to infrared wavelengths (the infrared channels detected the lava flow, hence the yellow colour). This isn't the first time the Terra satellite has spied out massive natural disasters like this. The school-bus-sized satellite, which orbits around Earth every 99 minutes, previously captured Kilauea's massive volcano fissures, as well as the 2017 California wildfires.",Lava everywhere!

Jonathan Shieber,"A little-known but highly influential group of attorneys from across the country will soon meet in Detroit and could change our skies forever. They claim their draft model legislation concerning drones will help protect privacy. However, their actions could have far-reaching effects on innovation, safety and future drone operations. The state-appointed members of the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) aim to promote uniformity by proposing model legislation for consideration by legislatures across the country. In Detroit, the ULC will continue work on a proposed Tort Law Relating to Drones Act drafted by commissioners who have no aviation or drone experience and without consulting the federal government, state legislators or the industry. Their subsequent proposal fails to recognize the federal governments exclusive control of airspace regulation and runs counter to existing law. The draft proposal draws an inflexible, arbitrary line 200 feet in the sky and, if enacted by the states, it would establish a new aerial trespass law. It anoints private property owners as de facto air traffic controllers, giving them a right to establish no-fly zones and creating a maze of flight paths with differing rules that operators must navigate on a house-by-house basis. As the draft goes much further than any existing state or federal law, its likely to cause significant controversy and could create a complicated patchwork of differing state laws that erode, rather than enhance, aviation safety. Creating roadblocks to drone use would stifle innovation, halt job creation and slow growth in this still-nascent industry. Consumer drones are one of the fastest growing products, with total sales expected to reach over $1 billion this year, according to the Consumer Technology Association. More than 110,000 commercial small drones are registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and it expects over 450,000 commercial drones to be flying by 2022. The ULCs proposal could prevent businesses and public service organizations from using drones. This could limit powerline and railroad inspections, prevent insurance companies from deploying drones to assess damage, or ground drone search and rescue operations after natural disasters, like hurricanes Florence and Michael. The ULC has essentially disregarded the concerns of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the FAA and the drone industry. Its proposal incorrectly states the DOT, FAA and others are supportive despite on-the-record letters opposing these efforts. The ULC has ignored attempts to correct these mischaracterizations. This isnt the first time the ULC has disregarded industry views. In 2014, it attempted to jam through model legislation that would have led to automatic disclosure of digital assets after death with little regard for privacy or whether the deceased consented. States rejected the proposal and the ULC was forced to revise it to require affirmative consent in wills before assets are disclosed as the tech industry had originally proposed. The ULCs lack of inclusiveness sits in stark contrast to the FAAs collaborative process to ensure the safe integration of drones into our skies. Its UAS Integration Pilot Program currently works with state, local and tribal governments across the country to conduct research that will shape a national drone policy framework in the coming years. The program provides a mechanism for localities to provide input to the FAA without infringing on its jurisdiction over the airspace. The recently enacted FAA Reauthorization Act also mandates a study on the roles of different levels of government in drone regulations. The ULC shouldnt undo the tremendous progress we have made. Instead, it should abandon its severely flawed proposal and leave airspace regulation to the FAA so the drone industry, and American aviation as a whole, can continue to safely operate in our skies.","A little-known but highly influential group of attorneys from across the country will soon meet in Detroit and could change our skies forever.

Liane Kupferberg Carter,"This article is reprinted by permission from NextAvenue.org. I was excited to read recently that a giant blob of hot rock is building up under the New England states. I needed a new natural disaster to worry about. Hello, my name is Liane and I am a recovering worry wart. Anxiety is hard-wired into my DNA. Or maybe its hot-wired. Either way, I blame my mother. Yes, I tend to be a tad nervous, so you can see why Id be delighted to think I could be blissfully warbling along with a bunch of my fellow boomers at the James Taylor concert at Tanglewood just as a hot balloon of bubbling rock blows up the Berkshires. But as big as the blob is, according to geophysicists, compared with other masses churning under the continental U.S., this ones not even a whopper. Bragging rights belong to the Yellowstone caldera, which squats over an active super volcano capable of eruptions thousands of times more violent than Mount St. Helens. Its like an unopened can of Mountain Dew thats been shaken. When the top finally pops, it will blast enough ash to blanket the lower 48. A Washington Post reporter observes such a scenario would be a bad day that requires some attention. A nice stab at ironic understatement. But it doesnt fly with jumpy folks like me. We know when were hearing a dog whistle for disaster. Read more: Yellowstone supervolcano may erupt sooner than thought, potentially wiping out planet When Im not obsessing about the cataclysm du jour and I realize some can be very serious with tragic implications, like the recent tsunami in Indonesia I have more pedestrian worries. Sink holes in parking lots. Bubonic plague in New Mexico. A 143-ton glob of fat known as the Whitechapel Fatberg menacing the London sewers. Existential questions about climate change Last year, I got all worked up when a trillion-ton killer iceberg the size of Delaware broke away from Antarctica. The Larsen ice shelf has been floating in Antarctica for at least 10,000 years. The chunk that broke off is known as Larsen C. Apparently there was a Larsen B which was the size of Rhode Island that I somehow missed, probably because I was too busy fretting that the century old Kensico Dam, a 6.8-mile jog from our house, might burst. As a professionally anxious individual, thinking about climate change makes me ponder existential questions. Whats the sense of doing anything if were already doomed? If theres global warming and oceans rise and weather patterns go kablooey, farm land will flood. Vegetable crops will fail. I, for one, will really miss avocado toast. By now you may be wondering, was she always this way? When my husband and I got engaged, he wondered the same thing. He asked my mother, Is your daughter the kind of person whos only happy when she has something to worry about? Yes, she said a little too readily for my taste. Why? Does this mean youre changing your mind? Hes still sticking around, though. He accepts that the 24/7 news cycle is a feast for folks like me, a big all-you-can-eat smorgasbord of doomsday delights. Theres always something for me to chew on. Killer tsunamis that wash away entire Japanese villages. Volcanic plumes from Iceland that shut down air travel to Europe. Bulging magma chambers spewing enough hot rock to fill the Grand Canyon. Adding a new worry Thanks to an article in the New Yorker last year, Ive been able to add the Cascadia Subduction Zone to my list. Apparently, theres a humongous fault line in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. A huge quake is coming. It isnt a matter of if, its a question of when. This one will be the Really Big One, unlike its more popular friend, the San Andreas Fault, which is merely the Big One. See: The Big One is a threat even if you dont live in California Heres a refresher for anyone who skipped Earth Science 101: Tectonic plates are those drifting slabs of mantle and crust. Like real-estate agents, they love to rearrange your stuff, only in this case its the earths oceans and continents. Subduction zones are the places where one tectonic plate slides underneath another. The tectonic plate in Cascadia is called Juan de Fuca. You might like: Florida and Texas are expected to take the biggest economic hit from climate change Juan is slipping steadily under North America. When scientists talk about it, they say scary stuff like, the paradigm has shifted to uh-oh. Words you never want to hear from a scientist. They say the subduction zone is 620 miles long, starting in California, meandering past Oregon and Washington, and terminating at Vancouver Island. After the Really Big One, anybody living 50 miles inland will be looking at beachfront property. Just yesterday, I got an invitation to speak at a book event in Portland, Ore. My immediate professional reaction was, Nuh-uh. The FEMA director in that area says, Our operating assumption is that everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast. Not the kind with avocado. So long, Seattle. Ta-ta, Tacoma. Farewell, Walla Walla. Ready with emergency essentials Thats when I told myself get a grip and switched off my iPhone. I needed a news cleanse. With nothing better to do, I lingered over breakfast. Then I lounged in the hammock. I was living the dream. Until I noticed how loudly the birds were twittering, which made me wonder what I was missing on social media. Were the polar ice caps still hanging on? Could you (and by you, I mean me) catch hantavirus by lying around in your own backyard? Not being stressed out was stressing me out. But my husband says hes not worried about me. He knows I actually handle these things better than youd think. Many years ago, we were shaken awake early one morning by a 4.0 magnitude earthquake. It sounded like a Mack truck idling under the apartment building. I leapt with fear from our bed. But I had the presence of mind to ask him, Did the earth move for you, too? In my defense, we were still newlyweds. So, yes, thats how I roll. I just heard theres a Noreaster heading up the coast. Which means Ive got escape routes to map. I need to reorganize my Go-Bag, which is not to be confused with a Red Cross-approved Shelter In Place Kit. My Go-Bag has all the emergency essentials I could possibly need, because you can never be too prepared. To be extra sure, Im packing my own avocados.

"Tal Kopan, CNN","Washington (CNN) Cassandra has lived and worked in the US over 20 years. Threats to her life have been made to her family and friends back in Nicaragua. It would be ""suicide"" to move back, she says. But the Trump administration says she and thousands of other immigrants like her must do so by January. On Jan. 5, roughly 5,300 Nicaraguans who have lived in the US since at least that date in 1999 will lose their protected status. If they have no other immigration status in the US, they will be forced to either return to the country or risk living in the US illegally. The decision to end temporary protected status for Nicaraguans last November was overshadowed by similar Trump administration decisions to end such protections for hundreds of thousands more immigrants from neighbors Honduras and El Salvador. Nationals of Nicaragua received the shortest time frame of any of those TPS recipients to get their affairs together: 12 months. But since that decision was made, Nicaragua has plunged into violence and political unrest, with at least 322 people dying there since mid-April, according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, part of the Organization of American States. By the White House's own count, the toll is more than 350. The UN Refugee Agency has put out guidance to its member countries asking them to allow Nicaraguans to enter and to apply for asylum once there. The situation is bad enough that the Trump administration sanctioned three Nicaraguan officials in July for human rights abuses, saying President Daniel Ortega and his vice president ""are ultimately responsible for the pro-government parapolice that have brutalized their own people."" In light of the violence, a bipartisan group of seven bipartisan lawmakers wrote to President Donald Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in late July asking the President to either reconsider ending temporary protected status for Nicaraguans or to designate a new status for them. ""It would be, frankly, I think, unacceptable to then send folks back to that same place that we're sanctioning,"" Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, one of those who signed the letter, told CNN. ""It's a barbaric regime that's literally murdering people in the streets.... It would be a catastrophe, and it's one that can be avoided."" Diaz-Balart said he has not gotten a response from the administration to the letter, though he remains hopeful it will reverse course. The Department of Homeland Security ignored repeated requests for comment from CNN about whether it's considering extending further protections to Nicaraguans. Temporary protected status allows foreign nationals to live and work in the US without fear of deportation when their home countries are beset by dire conditions, such as natural disasters, epidemics or civil war. Nicaragua was designated for the status in 1999 after a hurricane devastated the country, and it had been extended every few years by every president since. But the Trump administration has systematically ended most of the TPS protections on the books for more than 400,000 immigrants, saying it believes the status can be extended only if trouble in the countries stemming from the original disasters persists. Cassandra is one of the TPS holders whose time is running out. CNN agreed to identify her only by a pseudonym, after previous news reports about her prompted the threats to her family and friends in Nicaragua. She says she came to the US in 1996 on a tourist visa, fleeing a bad political situation and looking for work. When Hurricane Mitch struck in 1998, her town was wiped out by a mudslide, and crime and instability jumped. Under TPS, she started working in the US and built a life here, including serving as a local union leader. She will not have any legal status when TPS expires. She said that even though January is months away, she and her fellow Nicaraguan TPS holders are already losing their homes and businesses, and are ""terrified"" to go back. Cassandra and Diaz-Balart noted that TPS recipients must have clean records and are largely strong contributors to the US economy. Diaz-Balart's district has the highest concentration of Nicaraguans in the country, and he worries that Florida's economy could be hurt by losing them. ""We live with fear, waiting for January to come,"" Cassandra told CNN in an interview conducted in Spanish. ""We don't want to stay here illegally; it also frightens us to return to our country because of how bad the situation is. The police that are supposed to protect the people are instead the ones that are killing and assassinating the students that are the future for the development of my country."" Cassandra's fears are well founded, said Eric L. Olson, deputy director of the nonpartisan Wilson Center's Latin American Program. ""It would be speculative on my part, but one could say (returners) might be viewed with suspicion for their time in the United States, since the relationship is pretty fraught at the moment,"" Olson said, noting that many Nicaraguans fled during previous waves of political unrest and were largely opposed to Ortega's movement. ""The Nicaraguans that would be returning would be returning to a very dangerous and unstable situation, and the fear is it might create more migration and more instability in the region,"" Olson said. ""This is far from a resolved situation.... There is still a very serious conflict going on."" Cassandra says she always admired the US because of its commitment to democracy, and added that it seems hypocritical to send her and her counterparts back to a country run by a repressive leader the US has condemned. ""It is the world leader in democracy, that so much criticizes dictatorships and defends human rights, and now it wants to send us back to another dictatorship, where there is a great political insecurity,"" she said. ""We are at the point of a civil war in the country. So I see it as inconceivable that they'd send us there."" CNN's Catherine Shoichet, Natalie Gallón and Bethlehem Feleke contributed to this report.","Cassandra has lived and worked in the US over 20 years.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"On Tuesday, people in Japan with national broadcaster NHK’s app installed on their phones were sent an alert urging them to take cover after a likely missile launch by North Korea. “NHK news alert. North Korea likely to have launched missile. The government J alert: evacuate inside the building or underground,” the notification read, according to CNN. It was a false alarm. The news alert was sent at 6:55pm local time via NHK’s app and website. The broadcaster reportedly corrected the error five minutes later. The mistake is being blamed on a “switching error,” NHK World reported. The message was sent as part of the government’s J-Alert system, which was launched in 2007 so that local authorities could directly warn people of imminent threats including natural disasters, and nuclear and armed attacks, according to the Centre for Public Impact. “Before we introduced the new system, we had to depend on local officials to relay emergency information to households, sometimes in a primitive way like getting in their cars and driving around to alert residents,” Takashi Ito, a fire and disaster official, told Terra Daily in 2007 when the new system was launching. “But we wouldn’t have that much time to evacuate in such events as a missile attack. With the new system, we could give alerts to people much more quickly.” But the issue now isn’t immediacy, but accuracy. Japan’s false alarm comes just days after an incorrect alert was sent to residents in Hawaii. The notification read: “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.” But a few terrifying minutes later, the missile alert warning was reported as a mistake. Hawaii Governor David Ige told CNN that “an employee pushed the wrong button,” a seemingly easy screwup to make given the emergency system’s flawed design. As WIRED noted, all it took was clicking on the wrong option in a drop-down menu to spark mass panic. And the erroneous message in Japan isn’t the nation’s first: In July, the Japan Coast Guard issued a “navigation warning” to ships “in and around Japan as well as Southeast Asia,” alerting them that North Korea had launched a missile, according to The Japan Times. The mishap reportedly happened during a drill, and was withdrawn after about 40 minutes when a coast guard official “in another section noticed the mistake.” Donald Trump’s threats of starting a nuclear war certainly signal a need for rapid warning systems. But if the systems in place are so easy to screw up that a simple human error can send entire states and nations fleeing for cover and messaging loved ones, the systems are in desperate need of a refresh. Or, perhaps more importantly, we need more rational and competent leaders with access to the buttons.","On Tuesday, people in Japan with national broadcaster NHK’s app installed on their phones were sent an alert urging them to take cover after a likely missile launch by North Korea. “NHK news alert.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","When Marina Zurkow, an environmental artist and professor at New York University, embarked on designing a set of climate change-themed emojis, every little detail was intentional. She didn’t hold back one bit. Released in October, the current Climoji sticker set, available for Apple and Android users, paints a pretty grim picture of what climate change looks like. The set includes emojis of dying, starved animals, pollution, extreme weather, and even drowning people—not exactly a hopeful outlook, but that was kind of the point, said Zurkow. “We felt like one of the big problems is people don’t call climate change what it is,” Zurkow told Earther. “People don’t connect to the outcomes of a lot of anthropogenic destruction that we all participate in a really everyday way. ” Some of these outcomes aren’t far off. Climate change is already threatening more than 700 species of mammals and birds, so the dead penguins and starving polar bears emojis make sense. The world also got a taste last year of what flooding will look like under climate change: in Houston, in Florida, in Puerto Rico, and across South Asia. People are dying due to floods today, and climate change will threaten tens of millions more in the next few decades as river flooding risk and sea level rise worsens. The woke, racially observant eye (like mine) will notice a subtle—but key!—difference among Climoji’s cartoon characters. Four people are included, all of whom are dealing with some sort of flooding scenario. One, however, is sitting on a lifeboat, visibly startled but safe. The other three are either drowning or about to. Guess which one is white? You got it: The lady on the boat, who is most likely to survive. “Sometimes solutions can put us back to sleep.” Zurkow was grateful when I brought this up. No one else had asked her about it yet, and it was no coincidence. “Skin tones were not subconscious,” she said. “It’s not an accident that people who are saved in boats are not brown.” These emojis, a form of climate art, mirror the realities of today. The majority of people who die due to natural disasters live in predominantly non-white, low-income countries, according to a United Nations report from 2015 that looked at 20 years worth of data. Storms were the most deadly killers, claiming 242,000 lives between 1995 and 2015. South Asia accounted for 80 percent of those deaths. The set’s frank (and grim) pictures may seem depressing, but they serve a purpose of helping people “practice being awake to the problems around us.” As Zurkow put it, “sometimes solutions can put us back to sleep.” She and the rest of the team who helped put Climoji together aren’t necessarily trying to solve climate change through these emojis. They’re trying to start a conversation. They want the words “climate change” to become more a part of our everyday language. They do hope to launch a second emoji set once they secure funding—cartoons with a more hopeful tone. That set would include things like solar panels, windmills, reusable bags, electric cars, and recycling bins. Zurkow doesn’t want users—of which there are currently only about 350—to confuse these for solutions, though. “I don’t believe that any of these are solutions,” she told Earther. “They’re responses to produce a more resilient society.” A societal change, a shift in consciousness, is what’s needed to actually solve climate change. But emojis can’t do all that. Can they? Who knows. They certainly don’t hurt, though, especially as people struggle to understand the role they play in climate change. Only 52 percent of Americans believe humans are driving this global crisis. They need to get woke—and quick—because climate change ain’t waiting for no one.","When Marina Zurkow, an environmental artist and professor at New York University, embarked on designing a set of climate change-themed emojis, every little detail was intentional.

KIRK JOHNSON,"By giving scientists, officials and the people who live nearby so much time to stew over what could be happening, the slow-motion nature of the slide — at least so far — has already created tensions. About 75 people have been evacuated from nearby houses that may or may not ever be damaged. The local road at the foot of the hillside has been closed. Irrigation canal operators stand ready to open dams and take water from the river if it is blocked by a rock slide. Alternate highway routes have been mapped out, in case the interstate becomes impassable. Current projections, based on dozens of motion sensors that have been installed on the ridge, suggest that the collapse is most likely to happen sometime in late February. “In a lot of disasters, you don’t have as much warning as months — hardly any,” said Jeff Emmons, the emergency management director for Yakima County. “It’s a unique thing.” CANADA Spokane Seattle WASHINGTON Union Gap OREGON Portland 100 Miles BIRCHFIELD RD. 82 97 THORP RD. 1 mile In the last few weeks, the main mass of rock has been moving toward a gravel quarry at the base of the ridge. The company that runs the quarry has stopped operations and has voluntarily offered to put up evacuated residents in nearby hotels for five weeks at its own expense, though the cause of the crack has yet to be formally determined. Some things, though, are clear. The slide is occurring in a rumpled layer cake of volcanic rock, or basalt, laid down by eruptions that began about 17 million years ago, interspersed with thin deposits of silt and other sediments. Over time, the layers have folded upward, forming the ridge, and the topmost basalt layer is now sliding over the sedimentary layer beneath it. Many landslides are caused by infiltration of rainwater or groundwater, but geologists think that water is not involved in this case at all, just gravity. That makes Rattlesnake Ridge a sharp contrast to the recent mudslides in California, which were caused by rain and erosion on lands loosened by fires — at least 21 people dead, with many more still missing — or the devastating Oso landslide in northern Washington State nearly four years ago, which killed 43 people, after weeks of heavy rain. Still, all these events reflect the restlessness of the earth and nature that is part of Pacific Rim life. Even the name of the town, Union Gap, is a testament to natural violence: It refers to the huge gash in the ridgeline carved thousands of years ago by a colossal flood from ancient Lake Missoula. That lake once covered much of Montana, and when the Ice Age dam that constrained it broke apart, its waters left scars across the northwest as they roared toward the Pacific Ocean.

ROXANE GAY,"Photo President Trump looking out of the Marine One Helicopter last month. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times I could write a passionate rebuttal extolling all the virtues of Haiti, the island my parents are from, the first free black nation in the Western Hemisphere. I could write about the beauty of the island, the music and vibrant art, the majesty of the mountains, the crystalline blue of the water surrounding her, the resilience of the Haitian people, our incredible work ethic, our faith. I could tell you about my parents, how they came to this country with so many other Haitians, how they embraced the American dream and thrived, how I and so many first-generation Haitian-Americans are products of our parents’ American dreams. Or I could tell you about the singular, oppressive narrative the media trots out when talking about Haiti, the one about an island mired in poverty and misery, the one about AIDS, the one about a country plagued by natural and man-made disasters, because these are the stories people want to hear, the stories that make Haiti into a pitiable spectacle instead of the proud, complicated country it is. I could tell you how I have spent an inordinate amount of time and energy, throughout my life, educating people about Haiti and disabusing them of the damaging, incorrect notions they have about the country of my parents’ birth. On the eve of the eighth anniversary of the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake that devastated Haiti, the president, in the Oval Office, is said to have wondered aloud why he should allow immigrants from “shithole countries” like Haiti, El Salvador and African nations to enter the United States. Mr. Trump has tweeted a denial that he made this statement. “He said those hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly,” Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, who was in the room, said Friday. But the president has to know that even if video footage of the comment existed, there wouldn’t be any political consequences for him. He has to know, like we all do, that xenophobic commentary plays well with his base, the people who were more than happy to put him in office because they could seamlessly project their racism and misogyny onto his celebrity persona. It’s no wonder Fox News hosts have defended the comment. Now, in response to the news about the reports of the vile remark, there are people saying “vote” and highlighting the importance of the 2018 midterm elections, as if American democracy is unfettered from interference and corruption. There is a lot of trite rambling about how the president isn’t really reflecting American values when, in fact, he is reflecting the values of many Americans. And there are entreaties to educate the president about the truth of Haiti as if he simply suffers from ignorance. But the president is not alone in thinking so poorly of the developing world. He didn’t reveal any new racism. He, once again, revealed racism that has been there all along. It is grotesque and we must endure it for another three or seven years, given that the Republicans have a stranglehold on power right now and are more invested in holding onto that power than working for the greater good of all Americans.

Leanna Garfield,"Rudy Sales, center, stands in water from a king tide that flooded onto the Embarcadero in San Francisco, Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017. AP Humans have been able to track CO2 levels as far back as 8,000 years ago. From these observations, we know that the atmosphere and the air we breathe has never had as much carbon dioxide in it as it does today. Scientists have known that for a long time, but according to a new finding from Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, CO2 levels have reached a point that could have catastrophic effects on human health. As BI's Kevin Loria reported on Tuesday, for the first time in recorded history, the average monthly level of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeded 410 parts per million (ppm) in April. Research suggests this trend could lead to tens of thousands of pollution-related deaths, slow human cognition, and result in more frequent and powerful natural disasters. While this new record is dangerous for the planet overall, it could be even worse for urban areas, where more than half of the world's population lives. Some researchers believe that high levels of CO2 can form as ""domes"" over cities. According to a study from Stanford University, CO2 domes can have a drastic local impact, because they worsen the effects of localized air pollutants that cause respiratory diseases. The study's lead author, Mark Jacobson, estimates that the effect is already causing 300 to 1,000 deaths in American cities each year. That figure is likely higher for cities in developing countries. Most of the scientific community agrees that there's a relationship between climate change, rising CO2 levels, and natural phenomena like heat waves, sea-level rise, and superstorms. As the world sees a rise in CO2 levels, coastal cities — from New York City to Shanghai — become even more at risk of flooding from storm surges. These findings highlight the need for a regional approach to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, especially within urban areas.","In April, for the first time in recorded history, the average monthly level of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeded 410 parts per million (ppm).

"Sofie Werthan, Sofie Werthan","An aerial view shows submerged houses and facilities at a flooded area in Kurashiki in southern Japan on Saturday. At least 179 people have died as a result of landslides and flash flooding in Japan, as the country has been ravaged by heavy rains since last week. The death toll, which continues to rise, is the highest caused by rainfall in Japan since 1982, making this one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit the country since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami at Fukushima. The storms started on Thursday and continued through the weekend. Some prefectures, including Hiroshima and Okayama, received more than 20 inches of rain over the weekend. Some cities were inundated on Sunday with more than 10 inches of rain in only two hours, according to the Japanese public broadcaster NHK. More than 8 million people across the western and central regions of Japan have been ordered to evacuate their homes, and many have sought refuge in converted schools and other shelters. Those unable to leave have climbed onto rooftops as streets and buildings have flooded. The affected region—roughly half the country—is generally considered one of the safest areas in Japan because it is protected from typhoons and is not prone to earthquakes or tsunamis. In a cruel twist of fate, some survivors of the Fukushima disaster moved to this area for their safety. The storms have caused substantial destruction across the country. Although the government has not yet determined the full extent of the damage, as of Tuesday the Fire and Disaster Management Agency reported that 347 homes had been destroyed or nearly destroyed, and nearly 10,000 homes were flooded. These numbers are expected to rise substantially as municipal authorities finish conducting their own assessments. The health and safety conditions in the area are growing increasingly dire. Approximately 51,000 homes are cut off from electricity, and more than 250,000 homes are without water across 12 prefectures. Japan’s welfare ministry said there is no estimated time frame for the water to be restored. Susumu Nakano, the head of the Research Center for Management of Disaster and Environment at Tokushima University, told the Japan Times that water-treatment facilities in the country, often located near rivers, are at risk of being submerged when floods strike. Several water-purification plants in Okayama have been flooded, making it challenging for municipalities to provide residents with potable water. “Compared to [during] earthquakes, there are not enough measures” in place to protect water facilities from damage during floods, Nakano said. The crisis has been exacerbated by the extreme summer heat. The regions hardest hit by the flooding recorded temperatures in the high 80s and low 90s on Wednesday, putting affected residents and rescue workers at risk for heatstroke. A destroyed house in a flooded area in Hiroshima prefecture, Japan, on Monday. As the crisis unfolded, there were a few bright spots. In one case, a local man in the Okayama prefecture singlehandedly rescued 20 of his neighbors from the floods in a rubber dinghy. Hiroshi Nomura was watching the World Cup when his mother called to warn him about the flooding. Nomura drove to an embankment near his home, from which he saw that many of his neighbors were stranded, including an older man on a veranda with water up to his chest and several young children trapped in their homes. Nomura started rowing people to safety in his dinghy, eventually enlisting his friends to help. A 69-year-old man who was rescued by Nomura told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, “I am truly grateful because I don’t think I would have made it through another 20 minutes.” In another case that has gone viral, a miniature horse that inexplicably ended up on a rooftop during the flooding was rescued by members of a disaster-relief nonprofit while they were traveling to an evacuation center. The mare, named Leaf, had been a pet at a nursing home, and workers at the facility had released her to fend for herself when they were forced to flee during the storm. #西日本豪雨 調査の途中で屋根の上に立ち往生する馬を発見！馬は無事確保され元の飼い主さんと再開できましたが、現状で飼えないため一時預かることになりました。引き続き真備町で避難所ニーズと医療ニーズ調査を行なっています。ヤフーネット募金 https://t.co/MNOU8f3fHM pic.twitter.com/haG2ieUm2M — ピースウィンズ･ジャパン (@PeaceWindsJapan) July 9, 2018 The rescue team managed to get Leaf off the roof without any serious injury.

Fergus Jensen,"CIGONDONG/JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - As Indonesia reels from the carnage of yet another natural disaster, authorities around the globe are working on how they can prepare for the kind of freak tsunami that battered coasts west of Jakarta this month. 
The Dec. 23 tsunami killed around 430 people along the coastlines of the Sunda Strait, capping a year of earthquakes and tsunamis in the vast archipelago, which straddles the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire. 
No sirens were heard in those towns and beaches to alert people before the deadly series of waves hit shore. 
Seismologists and authorities say a perfect storm of factors caused the tsunami and made early detection near impossible given the equipment in place. 
But the disaster should be a wake-up call to step up research on tsunami triggers and preparedness, said several of the experts, some of whom have traveled to the Southeast Asian nation to investigate what happened. 
“Indonesia has demonstrated to the rest of the world the huge variety of sources that have the potential to cause tsunamis. More research is needed to understand those less-expected events,” said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton. 
Most tsunamis on record have been triggered by earthquakes. But this time it was an eruption of Anak Krakatau volcano that caused its crater to partially collapse into the sea at high tide, sending waves up to 5 metres (16 feet) high smashing into densely populated coastal areas on Java and Sumatra islands. 
During the eruption, an estimated 180 million cubic metres, or around two-thirds of the less-than-100-year-old volcanic island, collapsed into the sea. 
But the eruption didn’t rattle seismic monitors significantly, and the absence of seismic signals normally associated with tsunamis led Indonesia’s geophysics agency (BMKG) initially to tweet there was no tsunami. 
Muhamad Sadly, head of geophysics at BMKG, later told Reuters its tidal monitors were not set up to trigger tsunami warnings from non-seismic events. 
The head of Japan’s International Research Institute of Disaster, Fumihiko Imamura, told Reuters he did not believe Japan’s current warning system would have detected a tsunami like the one in the Sunda Strait. 
“We still have some risks of this in Japan...because there’s 111 active volcanoes and low capacity to monitor eruptions generating a tsunami,” he said in Jakarta. 
Scientists have long flagged the collapse of Anak Krakatau, around 155 km (100 miles) west of the capital, as a concern. A 2012 study published by the Geological Society of London deemed it a “tsunami hazard.” 
Anak Krakatau has emerged from the Krakatoa volcano, which in 1883 erupted in one of the biggest explosions in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunamis and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash. 
BROKEN WARNING SYSTEM 
Some experts believe there was enough time for at least a partial detection of last week’s tsunami in the 24 minutes it took waves to hit land after the landslide on Anak Krakatau. 
But a country-wide tsunami warning system of buoys connected to seabed sensors has been out of order since 2012 due to vandalism, neglect and a lack of public funds, authorities say. 
“The lack of an early warning system is why Saturday’s tsunami was not detected,” said disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho, adding that of 1,000 tsunami sirens needed across Indonesia, only 56 are in place. 
“Signs that a tsunami was coming weren’t detected and so people did not have time to evacuate.” 
President Joko Widodo this week ordered BMKG to purchase new early warning systems, and the agency later said it planned to install three tsunami buoys on the islands surrounding Anak Krakatau. 
The cost of covering the country is estimated at 7 trillion rupiah ($481.10 million). That is roughly equivalent to Indonesia’s total disaster response budget of 7.19 trillion rupiah for 2018, according to Nugroho. 
But other experts say even if this network had been working, averting disaster would have been difficult. 
“The tsunami was very much a worst-case scenario for any hope of a clear tsunami warning: a lack of an obvious earthquake to trigger a warning, shallow water, rough seabed, and the close proximity to nearby coastlines,” said seismologist Hicks. 
In the Philippines, Renato Solidum, undersecretary for disaster risk reduction, said eruptions from the country’s Taal volcano had caused tsunami waves before in the surrounding Taal Lake. 
He told Reuters that what happened in Indonesia showed the need to “re-emphasize awareness and preparedness” regarding volcanic activity and its potential to trigger tsunamis in the Philippines. 
The United States has also suffered several tsunamis caused by volcanic activity, including in Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington, according to the national weather service. 
MORE EDUCATION 
In Indonesia earlier this year, a double quake-and-tsunami disaster killed over 2,000 people on Sulawesi island, while at least 500 died when an earthquake flattened much of the northern coastline of the holiday island of Lombok. 
In a country where, according to government data, 62.4 percent of the population is at risk of being struck by earthquakes and 1.6 percent by tsunamis, attention is now focused on a continued lack of preparedness. 
“Given the potential for disasters in the country, it’s time to have disaster education be part of the national curriculum,” Widodo told reporters after the latest tsunami. 
For Ramdi Tualfredi, a high school teacher who survived last week’s waves, these improvements cannot come soon enough. 
He told Reuters that people in his village of Cigondong on the west coast of Java and close to Krakatau had never received any safety drills or evacuation training. 
“I’ve never received education on safety steps,” he said. 
“The system...totally failed.”

Andy Sullivan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Hurricane Irma bore down on Florida last September, the top U.S. disaster-response official ordered all hands on deck. With 4,500 Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers already helping survivors of Hurricane Harvey in Texas, FEMA chief Brock Long told managers in an internal memo to ready every member of the agency’s on-call reservist workforce for deployment. In the following months, thousands of FEMA reservists, who account for about half of the agency’s disaster-response personnel, would descend on Florida, Puerto Rico, California and elsewhere to help recovery efforts after an unprecedented string of natural disasters. But not all would respond. About 500 reservists, or one of every twelve workers, ignored FEMA’s deployment request, current and former officials told Reuters. “We didn’t even hear from them,” Patrick Hernandez, who oversees FEMA’s disaster workforce, said in an interview. “We need to get people in here who understand the system and adhere to the protocols.” With the 2018 hurricane season already underway, FEMA is scrambling to hire more people who are willing to depart at a moment’s notice for assignments that can last months at a stretch. Internal documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show the agency's disaster-response force is understaffed by 26 percent. And as last year revealed, many of those who sign up don't always respond when needed. (For graphic, see tmsnrt.rs/2Juw4LV ) That comes at a cost. At times, staffing shortages force FEMA to shuffle personnel from one disaster to the next and in some cases rely on workers who do not know how to do the job effectively, according to interviews with 15 current and former FEMA workers. Some local officials say the agency’s central mission - getting federal aid where it is needed - is undercut by the constant turnover. “They had no knowledge of the system. They had no knowledge about how to do anything but fill out forms,” said Junior Shelton, mayor of Central, Louisiana, which experienced catastrophic flooding in 2016. “We’re still sitting around waiting for that money to get here.” Hernandez said staffing issues have not affected FEMA’s ability to get the job done. “I would not agree with that statement wholeheartedly,” he said. Help wanted at FEMA: tmsnrt.rs/2Jxn6O1 ‘A VERY LOW NUMBER’ The extraordinary string of domestic disasters in 2017 continues to weigh on the U.S. agency. With thousands of workers still out in the field, official figures show that 33 percent of FEMA’s disaster-response workforce is available for deployment, down from 56 percent at this time last year. Some specialties are stretched especially thin: Only 13 percent of the workers who direct federal aid to pay for rebuilding costs after a disaster hits are currently available. “That’s a very low number, and that would be very scary going into more disasters,” said Elizabeth Zimmerman, a former senior FEMA official. Unlike military reservists, those who work for FEMA don’t have a guarantee that their regular jobs will be available when they return home. As a result, most are retirees who don’t need steady work or recent college graduates who don’t yet have a full-time job, current and former managers say. Reservists are allowed to turn down up to three assignments each year, meaning FEMA cannot count on a full reserve force during peak periods. According to internal figures, FEMA’s reservist corps has grown by roughly 1,000 workers over the past year. Still, it remains 3,700 workers short of the 10,949 reservists it has determined it needs to be able to respond to several disasters at once. Some reservists say they are not in a position to accept months-long assignments far from their homes. “I could get a phone call tomorrow telling me to go to Puerto Rico, but the truth is I’m not going to go,” said Alessandra Jerolleman, who said family obligations prevent her from leaving Louisiana. FEMA officials point out they can pull in other types of workers when needed. Some 22,000 federal employees from agencies like the Defense Department participated in disaster-relief work with FEMA in 2017, for example. “We rely on our reservists and we love them,” said FEMA’s Hernandez. “But FEMA’s made up of a lot of different elements.” SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS FEMA also hires residents of disaster zones to help out, a practice that is widely praised for boosting employment and harnessing local knowledge. But some say it can hinder FEMA’s effectiveness. Carlos Mercader, Puerto Rico’s top lobbyist in Washington, said he received numerous complaints of poorly trained FEMA workers who assess damaged houses in a seemingly arbitrary manner. While one might be declared a total loss, another that appeared to suffer similar damage might be denied reconstruction assistance, he said. Local hires accounted for more than half of the 2,878 FEMA employees in Puerto Rico in May, according to agency figures obtained by Reuters. Only 100 are permanent FEMA employees. “They probably should be sending us more people with as much experience as possible,” Mercader said. FEMA officials say Congress could help with recruiting and retaining reservists by guaranteeing they can keep their regular jobs while on assignment, as is the case with military reservists. Officials have also asked Congress to change hiring laws to give reservists preferential status when they apply for a full-time FEMA job. Congress has yet to act on those requests. But FEMA’s own actions may also drive away some who are willing to serve, reservists say. Paul Seldes, 59, said he tried unsuccessfully since 2011 to find an assignment that matched his background in field operations. Instead, the agency repeatedly asked him to report to a telephone call center to screen financial-aid requests from disaster survivors. By last fall, he no longer bothered to respond to such deployment requests, he said. “I have this capability, I have this knowledge, I have this training - why don’t you want to listen to me?” he said.

Eli Meixler,"A mere five countries contain 70% of the untouched natural ecosystems left in the world, and will only continue to survive with urgent international cooperation, according to researchers. Scientists at the University of Queensland (UQ) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) warn that Earth’s last remaining wildernesses are at risk of “disappearing completely.” Their report, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, maps the five countries — Russia, Canada, Australia, the United States, and Brazil — harboring the last totally natural habitats. The researchers defined “wilderness” as territory free of “human pressures” — including settlements, farmland and transportation infrastructure — over an uninterrupted range of 10,000 sq. km. (3,861 sq. mi.). The survey excludes Antarctica and the open seas, but the authors note that marine regions “free of industrial fishing, pollution and shipping are almost completely confined to the polar regions.” They found that changes to the Earth’s surface have been dramatic as well as rapid: 77% of Earth’s land area is now used for faming, up from 15% just 100 years ago. Protection of the remaining untouched areas could be critical to mitigating the effects of climate change, according to the report’s authors. Forests and seagrass meadows are important reservoirs of carbon. Other wildernesses can act as a buffer against extreme weather events, including by absorbing some of the impacts of extreme rainfall or natural disasters like tsunamis. The study comes in the wake of an alarming report from the World Wildlife Fund this week, which estimated that human activity has decimated wildlife population by 60% in the past four decades. An earlier WWF report this year warned that 50% of wildlife and 60% of plants in the world’s most biodiverse forests could be at risk of extinction over the next century. The Nature paper’s authors warned that Earth’s last wilderness will remain intact “only if it is recognised within international policy frameworks.” They also called on the five key countries containing the intact ecosystems to limit new industrial activity. The report comes ahead of the Convention on Biological Diversity this month, which aims to forge a plan for biodiversity protection beyond 2020. “Already we have lost so much,” the report says. “We must grasp these opportunities to secure the wilderness before it disappears forever.” Write to Eli Meixler at eli.meixler@timeinc.com.","Just five countries contain 70% of the natural ecosystems left, territory that will survive only with urgent efforts, researchers say",2018-11-01T04:12:54Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Just Five Countries Hold Most of the World’s Remaining Wilderness, a New Report Says",http://time.com/5441282/five-countries-worlds-last-wilderness/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/gettyimages-1015482488.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Natural disasters,1

Councilman Trayon White Sr posted a video of snow flurries on Friday and warned of ""climate manipulation"". He blamed the Rothschilds, a famous Jewish business dynasty, who are a target of anti-Semitic conspiracies. Mr White apologised for his comments on social media and said he ""did not intend to be anti-Semitic"". "" I really do apologise,"" he said on Twitter. ""I work very closely with the Jewish community and never want to offend anyone, especially with Anti-Semitic remarks."" The lawmaker said his Jewish friends were helping him realise the way his comments said in the Facebook video were rooted in anti-Semitic thought that dates back centuries. ""I see I should not have said that after learning from my colleagues,"" he said. The video, posted on Facebook on Friday morning, is shot through the windshield of a car driving in downtown Washington. ""Man, it just started snowing out of nowhere this morning, man. Y'all better pay attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation,"" he is heard saying. ""And DC keep talking about, 'We a resilient city.' And that's a model based off the Rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man. Be careful."" Conspiracy theorists allege that the Rothschilds, in conjunction with the famed American Rockefeller family, use technology to secretly manipulate the weather. The Rockefeller Foundation's Resilient Cities initiative, which provides grants to cities that address climate change, is the target of many of these theories. Mr White's comments insinuate the long-standing theory that the family manipulates world events for their own personal gain. He initially confirmed his voice in the video to the Washington Post. When asked to clarify his comments in a series of text messages, he said: ""The video says what it says."" He later apologised in a full statement. Jews for Justice, a Washington-based advocacy group that endorsed the official in 2016, said it was working with him to understand how his comments were anti-Semitic.

Eleanor Cummins,"As Hurricane Harvey ripped through Texas and neighboring gulf states in August 2017, leaving a record-breaking 30 million gallons of quickly-dirtied water in its wake, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, more commonly known as FEMA, moved into position. Among the personnel from federal agencies as varied as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Coast Guard were numerous Urban Search and Rescue teams —experts in finding people in the midst of a large-scale crisis, whether they’re stranded on a roof, or trapped deep beneath the rubble. For all their expertise, these responders aren’t going it alone. They’re equipped with listening devices, heat detection equipment, and, most importantly, some loyal sniffers. “We use the dogs [as] locating tools,” says Scott Mateyaschuk of the New York Police Department’s K9 unit. “The dogs will locate live human scent under structural collapse.” In his work for FEMA, which is fundamentally a constellation of emergency response experts who mobilize in a crisis, Mateyaschuk also helps to train and deploy disaster dogs across the country. While canine units are a tried and fairly true method for identifying people trapped in the wreckage of a disaster, analytical chemists have for years been working in the lab to create a robotic alternative. A synthetic sniffer, they argue, could potentially prove to be just as or even more reliable than a dog, more resilient in the face of external pressures like heat and humidity, and infinitely more portable. (As of this writing, you can’t hoist a dog with a drone.) But for all the excitement in academia, those on the ground remain skeptical. Man’s best friend—and tool Humans have utilized canine noses since at least the Middle Ages. Police dogs originated with medieval parish constables who, in addition to maintaining the palace, used bloodhounds, called “slough dogs” or “sleuths”, to hunt down outlaws. Seventeenth century monks living in Switzerland’s Great St. Bernard Pass used dogs to find pilgrims lost in the snow. The life-saving dogs have since been bred with other canines, leading to a heavier, jowlier descendant, the St. Bernard. By the turn of the 19th century, more scientific efforts to train canine units were underway. Ghent, Belgium established what is considered the first police dog training school in 1889. By World War I, the military began to train dogs to locate wounded soldiers. A thousand years later, the basic technology—that is, the dogs—remains much the same. Dogs have incredible olfactory abilities, with 100 times greater density of smelling cells in their nostrils than in the meager human nose. While humans breathe and smell through the same system, when a dog breathes in or out, the air travels through two different pathways, one for breathing, the other solely for smelling. They have another secret, too: a pheromone-detecting apparatus humans seem to lack altogether. Taken together, this specialized snout allows dogs to perceive odors in parts per trillion —an infinitesimal amount that comes in handy when their human handlers need them to identify the smallest whiff of a lost person. That means the key difference between search dogs of yesteryear and now is training. Taking all of the regional groups together, Mateyaschuk says, FEMA’s total canine headcount numbers around 285 “live find” canines, which are trained to bark when they discover a living person, and 85 cadaver dogs, expert in identifying the deceased. The dogs are from a variety of breeds: About 60 percent are Labrador Retrievers. The next most popular are Belgian Malinois, which constitute about 14 percent of FEMA-affiliated dogs. Other agencies have their own dogs: the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, has 1,000 dogs for deployment in airports across the country, for example. Dogs are also trained to track down invasive species and preliminary research is assessing their ability to detect cancer. Urban rescue dogs vetted by FEMA must complete a lengthy training course and have to pass a post-graduation verification process before they can go out in the field. The whole process sometimes takes as long as two years to complete—and that’s assuming they even get a shot at all. These days, prospective canines are aggressively vetted (pun intended). “Post-9/11, we’ve really dialed into testing the dogs prior to going into these different programs,” Mateyaschuk says. They look, first and foremost, for what he calls a “hunt drive,” which could also be described as a pathological need to please. While any dog could stand to learn something from urban search training, the basic drive to find something—anything—in exchange for a reward can’t be taught. Measuring the true success of these elite urban rescue K9s remains difficult, as the only way to know if a dog successfully identified every endangered person is through an entrapment simulation. In a real-life scenario like Hurricane Harvey or the Boston Marathon Bombing, dogs can only be measured by the number of people they do find; the number of people they don’t find may never be known. However, research that has been conducted on urban rescue simulations is heartening. One 2015 study, published in the journal Wilderness and Environmental Medicine, analyzed 25 experiments over four months with 10 dog and trainer pairs in England. The researchers found a 76.4 percent success rate among dogs in a simulated search and rescue environment, though they noted that some of the success was undercut by a high false positive rate—the dogs sometimes barked at the wrong thing, which, in theory, could delay them from identifying the right thing. Other experimental research of dogs in simulated search environments has found success rates as high as 95 percent. “What’s very unique about the canines is their ability to cover a large area of collapse in a very short period of time,” says Mateyaschuk. “There really has been no technology—yet—that can do that.” Can old dogs teach humans new tricks? While Mateyaschuk and the rest of the canine handlers associated with FEMA are satisfied with—even proud of—the work their dogs do, some scientists think search and rescue robots might one day provide a faster and more effective way of identifying victims in disasters. Assuming they can get the nose right. Sotiris Pratsinis is a professor of process engineering and material science at ETH Zurich, a science and technology university in Switzerland, about 3 hours north of the Great St. Bernard Pass. In a recent study in the journal Analytical Chemistry, Pratsinis and his colleagues shared the results of a preliminary study on a portable device that sniffs out humans in entrapment situations. Less like a robotic search and rescue dog than a metal box with an array of sensors inside, the system Pratsinis helped to develop detects chemicals common in human breath and skin, like acetone, ammonia, isoprene, and C02. It also detects shifts in relative humidity as the human mouth is typically much more moist than the surrounding environment. In theory, if one or more of these chemicals were identified in a concentration higher than background rates, a search and rescue team would know a human being was in the vicinity, even if they were trapped far below. “In an earthquake, you have a significant area to cover,” Pratsinis says. “You have an hour to save people, because after that, the survival rate become [smaller and smaller].” He imagines a day where the sensor array is made portable. That way, a first responder could hold it in their hand as they comb the disaster site, or they could suspend the device from a drone—a relatively recent addition to the FEMA toolkit —for even faster deployment. While dogs need rest and water in the midst of a search, Pratsinis notes his metal box will never tire. For now, though, the device is confined to the laboratory. In this initial study, participants were placed in a sterile plexiglass box for observation. Researchers looked first at chemicals released from their lungs, then at chemicals emitted from their skin, and finally at all of the chemicals released from both skin and lungs. The researchers found that, in particular, their sensors detected parts per billion of acetone, ammonia, and isoprene “with high accuracies… and precision, unprecedented by portable sensors.” Pratsinis is hopeful that with more research—and more research dollars—a portable sensor device like this could eventually be brought to market. Other researchers are working on similar projects, including mimicking canine respiration patterns, as documented in a 2013 PopSci feature by Josh Dean. But how long it will take before we see these technologies in the field is anyone’s guess. “We would love to make big claims,” he says, but, right now, “the sample size is too small.” The same is true for similar human chemical detection efforts, like other analytical chemistry research aimed at one day identifying human trafficking victims on ships in port with a similar sensor array. But agencies like FEMA, which would ostensibly be the main users of such a device, aren’t certain it’s necessary, or feasible. The fact that search and rescue teams are stationed around the country, typically coming together only in times of crisis, means standardization is important. Everyone must be trained the same way with the same device, which means the agency is methodical—perhaps even slow—in incorporating new equipment. That’s especially true given FEMA doesn’t really have its own research and development arm. Instead, it relies on external exploration committees, and regularly partners with another federal group, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to review new technologies. What’s more, Mateyaschuk believes in the efficacy of FEMA’s existing noses: the search dogs. “Over the last 13 years that I’m involved with this system, there’s been different things that have come along that have not been able to capture the unique olfactory experience that the dog has,” Mateyaschuk says. “Something to be said about the dogs is, if it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” And while Pratsinis is invested in the future of smelling devices, he acknowledges canines still have a competitive edge. “I wish we knew what the dogs were picking up,” he says. “The dogs don’t tell us.”","Technology If researchers can crack the chemistry, the applications are numerous.

Cory Doctorow,"An MIT research team has published a paper in Science detailing their analysis of the virulence with which truth and falsehood spread on Twitter; they analyzed 126,000 stories tweeted by 3m people 4.5m times, characterizing the stories as true or false according to consensus among a pool of independent fact-checking organizations, and concluded that ""falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information."" Lies, they concluded, were more interesting than the truth, because they were unconstrained by the ambiguity and nuance that makes truth less shareable than lies. They found bots sharing truth and lies, and concluded that this happened at the same rate regardless of the veracity of the stories. They say that this shows that the virulence of lies is down to humans, not bots. Although false rumors were measurably more novel than true rumors, users may not have perceived them as such. We therefore assessed users’ perceptions of the information contained in true and false rumors by comparing the emotional content of replies to true and false rumors. We categorized the emotion in the replies by using the leading lexicon curated by the National Research Council Canada (NRC), which provides a comprehensive list of ~140,000 English words and their associations with eight emotions based on Plutchik’s (31) work on basic emotion—anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust (32)—and a list of ~32,000 Twitter hashtags and their weighted associations with the same emotions (33). We removed stop words and URLs from the reply tweets and calculated the fraction of words in the tweets that related to each of the eight emotions, creating a vector of emotion weights for each reply that summed to one across the emotions. We found that false rumors inspired replies expressing greater surprise (K-S test = 0.205, P ~ 0.0), corroborating the novelty hypothesis, and greater disgust (K-S test = 0.102, P ~ 0.0), whereas the truth inspired replies that expressed greater sadness (K-S test = 0.037, P ~ 0.0), anticipation (K-S test = 0.038, P ~ 0.0), joy (K-S test = 0.061, P ~ 0.0), and trust (K-S test = 0.060, P ~ 0.0) (Fig. 4, D and F). The emotions expressed in reply to falsehoods may illuminate additional factors, beyond novelty, that inspire people to share false news. Although we cannot claim that novelty causes retweets or that novelty is the only reason why false news is retweeted more often, we do find that false news is more novel and that novel information is more likely to be retweeted.

Kate Stillwell,"December 6, 2018 8 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. In the Women Entrepreneur series My Worst Moment, female founders provide a firsthand account of the most difficult, gut-wrenching, almost-made-them-give-up experience they had while building their business -- and how they recovered. Jumpstart, which launched on Oct. 2, 2018, is a new type of natural disaster insurance that helps families and individuals bounce back from earthquakes through an immediate payout initiated via text message. Jumpstart connects the insured person to the insurer. Founder and CEO Kate Stillwell said she believes her company is, at its core, about resilience -- ensuring more money comes into the system after natural disasters and creating an upward spiral of recovery. But when natural disasters occur, everyone experiences losses at the same time, so insurers themselves need insurance (“reinsurance”). She tells us about her worst moment, when Jumpstart unexpectedly lost a partnership and up to $100 million was at stake. What follows is a firsthand account of this person’s experience. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. My worst moment was eight days before Jumpstart’s initial planned launch, about a year ago. We had built up a team of eight people. For 16 months we had worked shoulder-to-shoulder with our reinsurance partner, in preparation to sign the agreement that would authorize us to start selling policies on their behalf (and fund us with six months of runway). But someone got cold feet, and up to $100 million -- the entire pot of money we had in capital reserves to pay out our customers -- was at stake. I was in our office in a coworking space in Oakland, meeting with my team as part of our weekly “sprint.” My phone rang, and since I recognized the number calling was our partner’s account manager, I excused myself and walked into the common space. The account manager had been my primary point of contact for the past 16 months, and I could hear that he was close to tears. I remember him saying that he wished he wasn’t the one who had to give me the news but that it had been decided that our two companies were no longer going to be working together. They had called off the partnership. There was silence for about 10 seconds. I asked if he could tell me why, and I remember hearing that it was a combination of the high risks and the fact that we were a startup. Eventually, we hung up. Since Jumpstart pays out in earthquakes, where everyone needs money at once, we need access to a large pool of capital. But a startup doesn’t have millions of dollars in reserve, so we partner with one or more established companies who have deep pockets to make the payouts. There’s a David and a Goliath dynamic; we’re mutually dependent. The product can only be sold if we cooperate. The difference is, for “David” (us), this is the only product: cooperation is life or death. For the “Goliath” (the partner), this is one of many products -- they have other income streams. In my previous startup, we had a great partnership with this particular Goliath, so against the number-one piece of advice from almost everyone in the industry, I had agreed to be exclusive. That was my first mistake -- let’s call it an error of optimism. Another of my mistakes? I took at face value a claim that the partner would make us an investment worth several months of runway. I should have raised funds sooner from other sources. I felt blindsided, but that’s only because I was wearing rose-colored blinders. I should have seen the signs -- months of delays, creating new hurdles each time we cleared the last one, the right hand not talking to the left hand, reasons that didn’t quite add up. I returned to the team and pretended like nothing had happened because they were still in the middle of the meeting. That day it was my turn to drive the carpool of kids home from school, so I picked them up and then texted my mother about what had happened. I was very withdrawn. I remember that my mother gave me what I wanted to hear -- “You don’t deserve that!” -- while my husband had a different mindset: “Well, you knew this could happen.” Without the authority to sell, we couldn’t launch -- and we were at negative runway. The day after I got the call, I had to break the news to eight different people on the team individually. One of my teammates was leaving the next day to settle her late mother’s estate. I asked if I could drive her to the airport in the morning. She knew something was up. On the way, I remember telling her how sorry I was but that we’d have to let her go. We’d both known going into it that working for a startup is risky, but it was hard because we’d just hired her about six weeks before, and it was her first job after a career change. I went back to the office and met with our main developer, who was a contractor, and told him the bad news. I remember saying, “We have no more money. The launch is now many months, if not years, away. We don’t know what the future of the company is, and I’m going to be laying off everybody else.” He spent the next two to four hours buttoning things up and left. After that, I told another co-worker what happened -- and that I didn’t have to lay him off that day, but we were at risk, and I didn’t know exactly what would happen over the next two weeks. I told him it would be a good idea to start looking for other jobs. And that night, I had dinner with another teammate and told her the same thing. That’s how the team went from eight to six in one day. There we were: no launch, team gone, out of money, no basis of raising money. I was angry, humiliated and just plain sad. But I was still optimistic: We had fallen off the proverbial cliff, but we didn’t die. The core value proposition of our product -- what we’re fundamentally selling -- is personal resilience. It’s resources to tap into the inner strength that’s already there and adapt to the new normal after a shock. So, as a company, I thought, we’d better be able to walk that talk. Five weeks after that initial call, me and two of my remaining teammates -- people who knew their jobs would likely be gone soon -- took a huge risk. We decided to spend the company’s remaining funds on a flashy publicity stunt at an insurance conference in Las Vegas. We brought a “shake trailer” -- which simulates an earthquake -- and 400 conference attendees took a ride in it. One of them called it “brilliant marketing” and the “most fun thing” at the conference. About eight months later, his company would end up being our next partner. But that was months away. On the afternoon of the conference’s second day, I had to sit down with both team members who had accompanied me. I remember telling them, “I can’t pay you after today. I have to lay you both off.” One of them burst into tears. It took us over a year to make a comeback, but we survived by the grace of a few industry insiders who provided enough funding to tide us over. I remember them saying, “We know what happened to you, and it sucks. No one should have to go through that. We want to make sure you come out alive.” From this experience, I learned that there’s no other choice than to be optimistic. Entrepreneurs are creating the future -- not just for ourselves but for our communities and our collective children. That’s a huge responsibility and a huge opportunity. Having the courage to be optimistic -- in the face of setbacks, in spite of shock -- is the test of being a true entrepreneur. To others going through something similar, my advice is to stay optimistic and make decisions assuming the best. I relied solely on optimism and didn’t have enough of a safety net or plan B, so along with optimism, make a freaking backup plan!","Kate Stillwell, founder and CEO of Jumpstart, a natural disaster insurance startup, built her company back up after a devastating blow.",2018-12-06T22:04:24Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}","How This Entrepreneur Bounced Back After Losing a Partnership, Laying Off Her Team and Dealing with $100 Million at Stake",https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324254,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20181206215816-35031400111-39e8faac7e-o-crop.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,Natural disasters,1
"Nicole Wetsman, Nicole Wetsman","A decade ago, the Black Saturday bushfires burned over 1 million acres of the Australian state of Victoria. The fires killed 173 people, destroyed over 2,000 homes, and affected more than 100 communities. It stands as one of Australias worst ever bushfire disasters.
In the aftermath, principals and teachers were worried about the disasters effect on the kids in their schools, says Lisa Gibbs, director of the Jack Brockhoff Child Health and Wellbeing Program at the University of Melbourne, who worked closely with school principals and teachers.
There were real concerns about what they were seeing, Gibbs says. Her new study, which examined data from those schools, confirmed their worries: It found kids that saw more impact of the fire had poorer progression of their academic performance four years out from the fire.
Its pretty self evident that theres going to be distress experienced by everyone. What we know less about is how that plays out over time, Gibbs says. Though the schools had support programs in place, there wasnt much understanding of how the disaster might affect kids on a longer timeline. The findings show the importance of extended support, she says. Its not just something that needs to be there on the short term.
The study used data collected by the Department of Education and Training in the Australian state Victoria on nearly 25,000 kids to compare the changes in individual academic performance on measures like reading and numeracy between grades three and five. It compared kids in schools with low or no fire impact to those in schools with medium or high fire impact.
We looked at how they were progressing, compared to themselves. When they go from grade three to grade five, there should be an increase in learning. But in schools with medium and high fire impact, kids didnt progress as expected on reading and numeracy, Gibbs says. The concern is that they wont achieve their potential. It absolutely has the potential to influence their whole life trajectory.
The teams research didnt look to see if these kids eventually catch up and get back on track as they move into secondary school, which would be necessary to make more sweeping conclusions about these kids long term health. Ann Masten, who studies resilience at the Institute for Child Development at the University of Minnesota, says shed be hopeful. Im optimistic that there will be a long term positive picture, she says. Nonetheless, its important to document that there could be continuing delayed concerns.
The findings are similar to observations of childrens mental health in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, says Joy Osofsky, professor of pediatrics, psychiatry, and public health at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine. Almost half of the thousands of children studied had symptoms of depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. The symptoms went down, but didnt go down that much over three years, she says. Its absolutely consistent.
Although the study in Australia did not examine the cause of the academic changes the children experienced, Osofsky says that its possible to speculate that mental health symptoms could be contributing to academic challengesmore symptoms might make it harder to concentrate in school, for example. We were focusing on mental health following trauma, and those kinds of symptoms could impact academic performance as well.
New Orleans and Victoria, Australia are on opposite sides of the world, with different communities and different contextual challengesand its well documented that poor and marginalized groups bear the brunt of disaster impacts. But that the effects of disaster lingered for years after in both places highlights the commonalities between the way children experience these types of crises. We can certainly learn from each other, Gibbs says. We cant lose sight of the contextual elements, and its certainly not a one size fits all. But theres shared learning.
The study demonstrates the role of school-based interventions to help kids after disaster, Masten says. I think that schools need to recognize the importance of their role, not just in an immediate crisis, but over the long term, both in supporting learning and building a capacity for resilience, she says.
Researchers might be able to turn to the kids who do well after disaster to identify what that support might look like, she says. While the kids in Victoria were more at risk of a stalled academic trajectory, there are individual difference in response, even in the areas highly impacted by the fire. One of the goals of resilience research is to understand the good outcomes, Masten says.
This body of research also underscores the importance of preparing to respond to disaster, and for shoring up resilience skills before disaster hits. Osofsky, for example, is working to build regional coalitions with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network in the United States, to both help states better prepare within communities and schools, and to share information and provide support in the aftermath of disasters. In Australia, Gibbs is working with programs that help support emotional literacy for children, so that theyre better prepared in the event of a disaster.
Preparation is particularly important because the changing climate will increase the number of major environmental disasters. We always are framing this in the knowledge that the disasters are likely to become more frequent and more severe, Gibbs says.
Masten agrees with this trajectory. Its clear that we need more high-quality research going forward to inform what we should be doing, during the short and long term, to build up our capacity to withstand what we know are coming disasters.","Health As these weather events increase, implementing preparation strategies is key.

msmash,"""Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after it,"" wrote Jonathan Swift in 1710. Now a group of scientists say they have found evidence Swift was right -- at least when it comes to Twitter. In the paper, published in the journal Science, three MIT researchers describe an analysis of a vast amount of Twitter data: more than 125,000 stories, tweeted more than 4.5 million times in total, all categorised as being true or false by at least one of six independent fact-checking organisations. The findings make for unhappy reading. ""Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information,"" they write, ""and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends or financial information."" How much further? ""Whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1,000 people, the top 1% of false-news cascades routinely diffused to between 1,000 and 100,000 people,"" they write. In other words, true facts don't get retweeted, while too-good-to-be-true claims are viral gold. How much faster? ""It took the truth about six times as long as falsehood to reach 1,500 people, and 20 times as long as falsehood to reach a cascade depth of 10"" -- meaning that it was retweeted 10 times sequentially (so, for example, B reads A's feed and retweets a tweet, and C then reads B's feed and retweets the same tweet, all the way to J).","Researchers find fake news reaches users up to 20 times faster than factual content -- and real users are more likely to spread it than bots.

LINDA QIU,"When talking about trade imbalances, Mr. Trump frequently focuses solely on the deficit in goods. On that measure, he is even more wrong. Out of 234 trading partners, the United States had a trade surplus in goods with 129 countries or territories. Mr. Trump has frequently criticized trade deficits as weaknesses in American trade policy, but most economists do not see them that way. what mr. trump said I have 145 judges I will be picking by the end of a fairly short period of time, because President Obama wasnt big on picking judges. When I got there I said, how is this possible? I have 145, including Court of Appeals judges. And they just didnt do it, you know why? They got tired, they got complacent something happened. the facts Mr. Trump has been very successful in appointing judges to lower courts. But his suggestion Mr. Obama was less so because he got tired is not accurate. Mr. Obama successfully appointed 334 judges to federal courts. Gridlock in Congress, however, stalled most of his nominations in his last two years in office. Of the 71 people whom Mr. Obama nominated to the courts of appeals and district courts in 2015 and 2016, only 20 were voted on and confirmed, according to data compiled by Russell Wheeler, an expert on the judicial selection process at the Brookings Institution. He would have nominated more, but they faced blue slip vetoes, Mr. Wheeler said, referring to slips of papers that senators submit to or withhold from the Judiciary Committee in signaling approval or disapproval of nominees from their home states. what mr. trump said I heard somebody on a certain network last night, I won't mention which one, say why has President Trump given so much to North Korea? I said wait a minute. I asked Sarah Huckabee, please call this person. I gave him nothing other than I met. What did I give him? I didn't do what Obama did; give him $1.8 billion in cash to get back four hostages. the facts Mr. Trump is likely referring to a $1.7 billion cash payment the Obama administration made to Iran, not North Korea. The payment helped secure the release of three American hostages in 2016, but it stemmed from a decades-long dispute. As The Times has previously reported : Before the 1979 revolution, Irans shah had paid $400 million for American military goods but, after he was overthrown, they were never delivered. The clerics who seized control demanded the money back, but the United States refused. The additional $1.3 billion is interest accumulated over 35 years. The United States does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea and while it has provided emergency food and other aid in the past during times of famine or natural disasters, it has not paid North Korea for the return of any hostages.","President Trump made a host of inaccurate claims during a news conference at the United Nations on Wednesday, including about accusations of sexual misconduct, his share of the women’s vote, trade, judicial nominations and hostages.",2018-09-27T12:16:18Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Fact Check of the Day: Checking 6 Claims From Trump’s News Conference,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/us/politics/fact-check-trump-news-conference.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Natural disasters,1

Human extinction may be the stuff of nightmares but there are many ways in which it could happen.
Popular culture tends to focus on only the most spectacular possibilities: think of the hurtling asteroid of the film Armageddon or the alien invasion of Independence Day.
While a dramatic end to humanity is possible, focusing on such scenarios may mean ignoring the most serious threats we face in today's world. 
And it could be that we are able to do something about these.
Volcanic threats
In 1815 an eruption of Mount Tambora, in Indonesia, killed more than 70,000 people, while hurling volcanic ash into the upper atmosphere. 
It reduced the amount of sunlight hitting the surface of the Earth, triggering what has become known as the ""year without a summer"".
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora killed more than 70,000 people
Lake Toba, at the other end of Sumatra, tells a still more sinister story. It was formed by a truly massive super-volcanic eruption 75,000 years ago, the impact of which was felt around the world. 
It has been suggested that the event led to dramatic population decline in early humans, although this has recently been questioned. 
But while the prospect of a super-volcanic eruption is terrifying, we should not worry too much. Super-volcanoes and other natural disasters, such as an asteroid striking Earth or a star exploding in our cosmic neighbourhood, are no more likely in 2019 than any other year. And that is not very likely.
Growing threats
The same cannot be said for many global threats induced by people.
For example, the World Health Organization and the World Economic Forum both listed climate change and its effects as one of their top risks for 2019. 
Recent UN talks heard climate change was already ""a matter of life and death"" for many regions. While many, including Sir David Attenborough, believe it could lead to the collapse of civilisations and the extinction of ""much of the natural world"".
The threats are complex and diverse, from killer heatwaves and rising sea levels to widespread famines and migration on a truly immense scale.
Also increasing are the potential risks from novel technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). 
The scenarios range from increasingly sophisticated cyber-weapons that could hold an entire nation's data to ransom, to autonomous algorithms that could unwittingly cause a stock-market crash. 
Another threat is the possibility of a nuclear war. 
While many focus on rising tensions between global powers, new technologies may also be making us less safe. 
This is because of both the ""entanglement"" of nuclear and conventional weapons and the risk that AI could help unleash nuclear war.

 Avian flu exercise in Hebi, China
Another risk that may be increasing is that of global pandemics. Influenza, for example, is thought to kill an average of 700,000 people and cost the global economy $500bn (£387,000) per year.
Increasingly dense and mobile human populations have the potential to see new influenza strains spread easily. And this raises concerns about a future outbreak like the 1918 Spanish Flu, which killed up to 50 million people. 
However, widespread vaccination programmes and other disease prevention measures help reduce this risk.
How to calculate the chance of an existential risk
Look at historical or geological records. We can keep track of some events such as super-volcanoes and asteroid impacts
Find a natural precedent. When scientists explored the risk the Cern reactor might pose, they looked at similar environments that occur in stars
Build a model. Scientists use sophisticated atmospheric models to explore the future of our climate
For threats that can't be modelled, scientists generate insights by engaging in war-gaming and other exercises
The UK government also maintains a register of national risks, including floods, space weather and disease
A disruptive future
While these threats are real, the greatest danger we face in 2019, when viewed from a global perspective, probably lies elsewhere. 
With almost eight billion people living on Earth, we are increasingly reliant upon global systems to sustain us. These range from the environment that provides us with food, water, clean air and energy, to the global economy that turns these into goods and services.
Yet, from declining levels of biodiversity to overextended infrastructure and supply chains, many of these systems are already stressed to breaking point. And rapid climate change is only making things worse.
Given this, it may be that global risks should not be defined by the size of the disaster that caused them, but by their potential to disrupt these vital systems. 
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 A volcanic ash cloud prompted disruptions to flights around the world in 2010
The potential is hinted at in recent examples of cascading effects.
The 2010 eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano killed no-one but closed air traffic over Europe for six days. And, in 2017, the relatively unsophisticated WannaCry ransomware attack shut down parts of the NHS and other organisations around the world.
Since almost everything we rely on also depends on a functioning electrical, computing and internet system, anything that would damage this - from a solar flare to a high atmosphere nuclear explosion - could cause very widespread harm. 
More stories like this
Disaster prevention
There may, however, be new ways to reduce this risk.
There is an old story of King Canute of the Danes futilely commanding the sea to retreat. A similar sense of powerlessness can easily overtake us when we consider potential future catastrophes. 
However, the truth is that while King Canute may have failed, the Danes have been pushing back their shoreline for generations: building dykes and draining marshes to protect themselves from the oncoming tide.
Sometimes it is better to protect ourselves by thinking of ways to make humanity more resilient to disasters that are to come.
And this could give us the best way of ensuring that 2019 - and beyond - are safe years for humanity.

"Michael Waters on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Jose Herrada, an inmate at Floridas Gulf Correctional Institution, first heard news about Hurricane Michael on the radio. Initially, Herrada thought little of it. Although the state of Florida had issued a mandatory evacuation order for nearby Panama City and surrounding areas, officials at Gulf CI hadnt brought up the possibility of evacuating the prisons 1,500 inmates. Herrada assumed that meant he would be safe. We thought [the hurricane] was not coming close when they did not evacuate us, Herrada told Earther by email. If officials at Gulf CI reached a similar conclusion, they were dead wrong. The prison took a direct hit from Hurricane Michael as the historically-powerful storm surged across the Florida Panhandle on October 10th. The damage to was immediate: The facility lost power, and phone lines stopped working. Water started flooding in through cracks along the windows. The wind was so strong that it cleaved off several dormitory roofs and a section of the perimeter fence, according to Herrada and The Miami Herald, and inmates had to rush to keep their belongings dry as water flooded in. Buzzfeed reported that many dorm rooms were destroyed and that some windows were entirely blown off. We were scared, Herrada told Earther. Most of us are scarred emotionally. I myself have nightmares. Although the Florida Department of Corrections evacuated six prisons prior to Hurricane Michaels arrival, Gulf CI is one of a number in the path of the storm were not evacuated in advance. Four days after the storm, on October 14th, Gulf CI and other hard-hit prisons were fully evacuated until further damage assessment can be completed, per the department. Michelle Glady, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections, told Earther the department makes determinations about what facilities should be evacuated in the best interest of public, staff and inmate safety based on wind speed, flooding history, building age, road safety, and other factors. Glady added that much like many North Florida communities, our facilities sustained damage but, in all prisons, our staff and inmates were safe, and no one was injured during the storm. Herrada takes a different view. They took a gamble with our lives, he told Earther. In recent years, a spate of mishandled hurricanes has exposed the failures of the U.S. prison system to account for those it incarcerates during natural disasters. The problem was on full display during the two most destructive hurricanes of 2018. A month before Michael, in September, Hurricane Florence bore down on the Carolinas. While North Carolina and Virginia evacuated prisons under threat, the South Carolina Department of Corrections refused to evacuate facilities that lay within high-risk zones. And climate change, which expected to produce bigger and deadlier storms, could place already-vulnerable incarcerated people in even greater danger. Thats not only because their personal safety is consistently ignored during storms, but also because prisons themselves are often at greater risk from hurricanes than other housing structures. According to Yale researcher Hannah Hauptman, who mapped out prison geographies in a recent paper, prisons are disproportionately located on low-lying land that remains vulnerable to storm impacts, in part because many U.S. prisons are former slave plantations. The state approves of and constructs prisons significantly closer to dangerous floodplains than it does for other forms of settlement, Hauptman notes. Even today, private companies sometimes fail to consider storm risks when choosing the locations for new prisons. Washingtons Northwest Detention Center, which opened in 2004, houses up to 1,575 immigrants in one of the nations riskiest tsunami zones. In the event of a tsunami, according to The Seattle Globalist, the prison will fill with as much as two meters of water in less than eight minutes. (Northwest Detention Center did not immediately return Earthers request for comment.) We tend not to prioritize the needs of people who are incarcerated, Keramet Reiter, a professor of criminology at the University of California Irvine School of Social Ecology, told Earther. In a disaster they are maybe the last priority. The problem is deeply entrenched, beginning with the fact that many prisons do not even have clearly stated emergency evacuation plans during natural disasters, and there is no state or national requirement that they do, as noted in a recent paper by Columbia Law student William Omorogieva. (Some states require other forms of emergency planning, but none mandates plans specific to natural disasters.) Shaundra Young Scott, director of the ACLU in South Carolina, told Earther that part of the issue is funding. Evacuations are expensive, and in South Carolina, where the state has already slashed mental health programs in its prisons in the last eight years, its pretty clear the state legislature is loath to spend money on prisoners, and quite frankly, they arent worried about evacuation because they dont care about prisoners. When voters also tend to lack empathy for people in prison, there is no political will to change the system. Reports of inmates stranded by devastating hurricanes date back to at least 1937, when the Kentucky state reformatory broke into riots after days without drinking water. Following Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans prisoners who were not evacuated smashed windows to let air in as the floodwaters rose, and they lit their shirts on fire so aid workers would know they were trapped. Last year, during Hurricane Harvey, Houston inmates in multiple prisons were left in cells flooded knee-high with water contaminated by urine and feces without enough food or drinking water, according to The Nation. Texas inmate Deidre McDonald wrote for The Marshall Project about waking up to the sound of thunder cracking and officers screaming for everyone to get to the second floor the morning that Harvey made landfall. Though the state had issued an evacuation warning for Dickinson, Texas, where she was held, the prison did not relocate the group of predominantly disabled inmates living there. McDonald noted that her prisonlike so many otherswas structurally unequipped for a dangerous hurricane: Given the way the Texas Department of Criminal Justice built this place, the sidewalks overflow during even the lightest rain, creating a constant slip-and-fall hazard for the predominantly disabled offender population here, McDonald wrote. We tend not to prioritize the needs of people who are incarcerated. In a disaster they are maybe the last priority. Last year, after Hurricane Irma struck her 700-person Miami prison, Homestead Correctional Institute, inmate Natalie Price went two weeks without power. Around her, people were crammed three to a room. Two inches of water lined the floors, Price told Earther, and more leaked in through the walls. All things considered, Price feels the prison administration handled things well for our state emergencymost of the problems, she said, came not from the administration but from the old age of the buildings, which were prone to leaks. Most of the families of inmates around her also didnt understand what was happening, according to Price. Although the state notified them that the Homestead Correctional Institute would be evacuated, it never was. This fall, even Florida prisons located further from the shore than Gulf CIlike Apalachee Correctional Institution, which houses up to 1,300 peoplefelt the effects of Hurricane Michael. Michael Henderson, an inmate at Apalachee CI, told Earther that the prison is so old that even before Hurricane Michael, some windows were broken or outright missing. When the storm arrived, rain rushed in through the open windows, and inmates scrambled to salvage their belongings. For some of us, like myself that meant vital legal work that if destroyed would have left me at a major disadvantage, Henderson said. Yet the worst part was not the flooding itself but the unrest after. Inmates were stuck in lockdown and unable to leave their dorms, Henderson said, recalling that they ate only cold sandwiches served at odd hours. On October 14th, four days after Hurricane Michael, the dorm across from Hendersons broke into a full on free for all that resulted in officers armed with tactical gear detaining inmates. About thirty men were removed and taken to confinement or transferred, Henderson said. (Apalachee CI did not respond to Earthers request for comment on this incident, but verified a near riot over food to the Florida Times Union in October.) The officials knew this hurricane was coming and did little to prepare, Henderson added. The systemic failures of the prison system to account for the people it incarcerates during major storms has not escaped the notice of inmates. Before a hurricane, more experienced inmates often warn newer ones about the unique dangers they face. Back at Gulf CI, Shamar McCullum, another inmate, calls this the talk. McCullum told Earther that a group of older inmates sat him and others down before the storm and warned them that officers may leave to save themselves; that after the hurricane, each person should eat light; and that each inmate should save his most valuable property because it may get flooded out. (According to McCullum, the last two concerns proved to be true.) McCullum also told Earther that, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Michael, he had little access to drinking water because the pipes burst. Food came infrequentlyon the third day, he was fed only one meal. McCullum recalls that when an inmate asked an officer when their meal was coming, the officer responded, Better hope you even get feed at all. Thats when I knew it was not looking good for us, McCullum said. Inmates who asked to be seen by nurses were refused and threatened with disciplinary reports because of the lockdown, according to McCullum. He and the other inmates had no way of communicating with their families, though Gulf CI did relay a message that everyone was OK, McCullum said. They spent long days sitting in their cells without possibility of leaving. When presented with these allegations the Florida Department of Corrections told Earther that although it could not confirm or deny individual claims, all inmates had access to food and drinkable water and medical needs were addressed and prioritized, and inmates have access to routine care. Only two days after Hurricane Michael made landfall, Gulf CI was reduced to such disrepair that the first set of inmates were finally evacuated. Adam Baird, a Gulf CI inmate, said that when the evacuation order finally came, many inmates had gone a day without food. 50 or 60 officers came in around 10:30 pm and told everyone to grab their toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, and deodorant, and tie the rest of our property in a sheet and leave it in the cell, Baird told Earther, recalling the evacuation. McCullum, for one, was relieved. Now that it is all over I still find myself day dreaming about just how bad things could have been if I stayed one more day at that place, he said. What I and the others went through is a experience I dont want anybody thats locked up to go through because officers dont care about inmates, especially at the time of a hurricane. McCullum and the other Gulf CI inmates have been moved to a patchwork of neighboring prisons, including Mayo CI and the Northwest Florida Reception Center. They do not know whenor ifthey will return to Gulf, but because of the damage, they dont expect it will be anytime soon. (Maintenance crews are currently working on repairs, according to the Florida Department of Corrections.) Whether their experiences will propel policy changes remains to be seen. Some researchers, like Omorogieva of Columbia Law, have proposed that FEMA create a special coordinator for incarcerated populations who could craft new requirements to evacuate inmates during natural disasters. There is even a mechanism for doing this: Congress could expand the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which created a Disability Coordinator within FEMA, to also address the needs of incarcerated people. But that requires political will. And although during this years National Prison Strike incarcerated activists highlighted the importance of environmental issues, and a disparate group of protesters convened outside the South Carolina State House to demand evacuations during Hurricane Florence, few lawmakers have even acknowledged the risks that incarcerated populations face during major storms.

Megumi Fujikawa,"TOKYO The Japanese economy contracted during the three months through September as a series of natural disasters hurt exports and spending by tourists. The worlds third-largest economy shrank at an annualized pace of 1.2% in the third quarter of 2018 following a 3% expansion in the previous quarter, government data showed Wednesday. Economists polled by data provider Quick had forecast a 1.0% contraction. While many analysts expect the economy to return to growth in the October-December quarter, the longer-term outlook remains cloudy owing to potential spillover effects from the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Private consumption, which accounts for nearly 60% of gross domestic product, declined 0.1% in the third quarter. Bad weather kept consumers at home, while increases in fresh food and energy prices made them reluctant to spend elsewhere, economists said. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

Sally French,"2017 was a huge year for natural disasters in the U.S. Damage from a range of disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the wildfires in California and tornadoes in southern Louisiana, added up to more than $306 billion, a new U.S. annual record. The U.S. experienced 16 climate-related disasters where losses exceeded $1 billion, according to a new report from NOAA. The previous costliest year for the U.S. was 2005 with losses of $215 billion driven in large part by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita. 2017 was also the third warmest year since records were kept beginning in 1895; the only warmer years were 2012 and 2016. Five of the warmest years on record have all occurred since 2006. And five states in 2017 – Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina and South Carolina – had their warmest year on record during 2017. With the immense warming also came immense rain. 2017 was the 20th wettest year on record, and the fifth consecutive year with above-average precipitation. The nation saw many large-scale floods, including those associated with the hurricanes. The rains also helped to end a multiyear drought in California and Nevada, though experts say that the heavy rains also meant the flourishing vegetation contributed to the wildfires that would strike later. One of President Donald Trump’s final tweets of 2017 was to call for “a little bit of that good old Global Warming.” In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2017 Trump’s tweet may be intended to cast doubt on climate change, but ignores the difference between weather and climate. Weather looks at events over a short time scale, while climate refers to the atmosphere over long periods. Trump has repeatedly referred to climate change as a hoax.

A powerful winter storm struck the Northeast in what some referred to as the “bomb cyclone.” Major flooding was reported in Massachusetts, where the highest tide in almost 40 years turned some Boston streets into rivers of icy slush up to 3 feet deep, and thousands of flights were cancelled due to the snow and wind gusts.

"USA TODAY, Rick Hampson, USA TODAY","An explosive wildfire closed down dozens of miles of a major California freeway. The Delta Fire erupted Wednesday afternoon and within hours devoured nearly 8 square miles on both sides of Interstate 5 near the Oregon state line. (Sept. 6) AP Firefighters tried to control a back burn late last month as the Carr fire continued to consume acre after acre in northern California. The fire is one of many natural disasters that have riveted Americans this summer. The Carr fire was notable for what was described as a ""fire volcano'' in the city of Redding with a diameter the size of three football fields. (Photo: MARK RALSTON, AFP/Getty Images) Will repeated exposure to vivid scenes of natural disaster — Western wildfires, a global heat wave, Hawaiian volcano eruptions, the 2017 hurricanes’ anniversary and a suddenly active 2018 season — finally turn America into a go-bag nation, prepared for calamity and ready to flee it? Experience counsels skepticism. So does human nature. The sight of a 30-story-high wave of fire consuming a Colorado subdivision, or a California “fire tornado” as long as three football fields, may rivet a national audience. But it probably won’t change national attitudes about how to prepare for an emergency or when to evacuate. Experts say people aren’t really motivated by disaster until it comes to, or through, their door. “I don’t know what it’ll take,’’ says Jay Baker, a retired Florida State University geographer who has studied evacuation behavior, “but disaster scenes are not enough.’’ More: Tropical Storm Florence creeps closer to US, to head toward East Coast as major hurricane Take the case of Lauren Sand. When she was a kid her family built a house on the west side of Los Angeles. This was shortly after the Bel Air Fire of 1961, one of worst wildfires in California history. When she moved into the neighborhood, the hillsides were still charred. On the next ridge, a row of chimneys marked where houses had stood before the fire. As an adult, Sand created Grabbit the rabbit, a cartoon mascot for emergency preparedness. She marketed Grabbit-themed products, such as a kids’ backpack stuffed with necessities for a quick escape. But last December, when a pre-dawn wildfire came roaring toward the same home where she grew up, Sand was taken by surprise. She learned of the fire only when a friend saw it from the freeway and called to warn her. Sand grabbed her laptop, purse, phone and some papers, and hopped into her car. When she looked in the mirror, she saw a wall of black smoke rolling down the street. She gunned her Prius like it was a Maserati. She escaped, but without a coat, toothbrush, cherished family records and photos, and the architectural plans for her house (which, unlike several on the street, was spared). She left the pool uncovered and found it, when she was able to return three days later, filled with ashes. Grabbit would not be impressed. One of several homes destroyed by a wildfire on Lauren Sand's street in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles last December. The pre-dawn blaze raced up a hillside before most residents realized they were in danger. No one was killed, but few were prepared. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) A land of natural hazards America is riddled with fault lines and bordered by storm-tossed oceans, with two great north-south mountain ranges but none running east-west to keep Arctic air from flowing south and tropical air from going north. There are hurricanes in the Southeast and nor'easters in the Northeast; tornadoes on the lower Plains and blizzards on the upper Plains; earthquakes and volcanoes along the Pacific Coast, which also is vulnerable to tsunamis; sinkholes and lightning in Florida; avalanches in the Rockies and flash floods in the Appalachians; hail from Minnesota to Texas and ice storms from Wyoming to Maine; lake-effect snow from the Great Lakes and the Great Salt Lake; and monsoons in Arizona. In the first half of this year, six natural disasters each caused at least $1 billion damage and killed a total of 36 people. This came after 2017, the costliest year on record. It included California’s Wine Country fires, which killed 44 and destroyed 10,000 homes; Washington State blazes that dumped ash on Seattle like snow and pushed the air quality index in Spokane to “hazardous;’’ and three hurricanes — Harvey, Irma and Marie — so bad their names were retired. Global warming makes wildfires hotter and probably will make hurricanes bigger. And the number of people living in harm’s way, including active earthquake and volcano zones, is increasing. Yet, as FEMA administrator Brock Long observed this year, America lacks a ""culture of preparedness.’’ We mostly don’t stock up on batteries, candles and water; we don’t prepare a family emergency plan or buy a hand-cranked radio; we don’t listen carefully to warnings and often don’t understand them when we do. Or obey them. A survey in Florida after Hurricane Irma by Mason-Dixon polling found that only 43% of those under mandatory evacuation orders actually evacuated. Plumes rise where lava pours into the sea from Kilauea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii last month. The eruption has destroyed more than 700 homes. It's just one of many natural disasters grabbing Americans' attention this summer. (Photo: USGS via AFP/Getty Images) A 2015 study by the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University found that two-thirds of Americans said they were not prepared to evacuate in an emergency. But Irwin Redlener, the center’s director, believes the situation is actually worse. Sometimes, when he’s speaking to groups of emergency preparedness specialists, he’ll ask how many have a personal or family evacuation plan. Only a few hands go up, and most of their plans turn out to be half-basked. Redlener thinks he knows why: It’s hard. A plan sounds like a good idea until, say, you face the question of what to do about your kids at school in case of a disaster. Do you go get them? Does your spouse? Traveling could be risky, so what are the school’s plans in an emergency? And how do you find out? Suddenly, you notice the lawn needs mowing. Last year two Wharton business school professors, Howard Kunreuther and Robert Meyer, published The Ostrich Paradox: Why We Underprepare for Disasters. They identify six unconscious biases that undercut our ability and willingness to prepare. 1. Myopia: We focus on the short term and have difficulty understanding long-term consequences, such as the 100-year flood. 2. Amnesia : We forget the past. We buy a condo in complex built where a storm once blew away a shopping center. 3. Inertia: We do what we’re doing until something drastic happens, when it’s too late. See New Orleans and Katrina in 2005. 4. Selectivity : We don’t look at all the information, or simplify to the point of inaccuracy. If we have an emergency check list, we lose interest after covering a few items, without making sure they were the most important. 5. Herding : We make choices based on what the other person is doing. And so we both wind up treading water. 6. Optimism : This most American of traits leads us to underestimate risk, ignore worst-case scenarios and think bad things will only happen to others. It’s a great attitude for someone starting a business, not so much for someone living in a flood zone. There are others factors, such as cost. Some people living in disaster-prone areas don’t move because they can’t afford to. Even assembling a comprehensive go-bag can be prohibitively expensive for some families. And there’s always sheer ignorance. Many people living along the New Jersey coast during Superstorm Sandy in 2012 had no idea what hurricanes do to barrier islands until they found their roads clogged with four feet of sand. A hard habit to change Viral internet images and nonstop TV news coverage of this year’s disasters and disaster anniversaries have inspired some hope that Americans will begin to focus more on preparing for emergencies, rather than just reacting to them. But Baker, the evacuation expert, says there’s little evidence that evacuation behavior is influenced by such things. In 2005 he was conducting a survey of public evacuation attitudes on Long Island when Katrina struck New Orleans. He assumed that news of the disaster would ruin his study, skewing Long Islanders’ attitudes artificially and temporarily. Instead, he got the same kinds of responses after the storm as before it. He says most people won’t change unless they’ve experienced something like a living room with six feet of water. But many Americans never face anything more perilous than a thunderstorm or a blizzard. A New York Times analysis this year of Small Business Administration data concluded that a relatively small part of the country has sustained most of the damage from major natural disasters; about 90% of the losses occurred in ZIP codes with less than 20% of the population. The Wharton professors called their book The Ostrich Paradox because of a common misimpression. The bird reacts to danger not by sticking its head in the sand — the way many humans deal figuratively with the prospect of natural disaster — but by running at speeds of up to 43 mph. That was about how fast Lauren Sand was driving when she fled the wildfire last December. Now, despite the expert pessimism, she thinks attitudes can change. “Everyone feels vulnerable,’’ she says, “not invincible anymore.’’ More: Rare volcanic 'fire tornado' caught on camera Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2N2mQIM",Americans are being blanketed by scenes of natural mayhem this summer.

Aria Bendix,"For years, scientists have warned of the ""next big one,"" an earthquake so powerful that it could topple buildings, slash power, and take lives across California. As far as natural disasters go, the quake represented the worst-case-scenario for cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, which are both located along the San Andreas Fault. 
 Now government experts claim there's an even bigger threat to California residents: a potential mega-storm that could inundate cities and cause up to $725 billion in damage. 
Read more: Natural disasters set records around the world in 2018. These were some of the worst.
 That's more than double the damage that could hail from the ""next big one,"" according to the latest estimates from data analytics firm CoreLogic. 
 In 2011, a team of scientists and other experts at the US Geological Survey (USGS) likened the mega-storm to the California winter storms of 1861 and 1862, which killed thousands and left a 300-mile-long lake in the center of the state.

The future doomsday scenario — known ""Atmospheric River 1,000,"" or ARkstorm for short — could surpass levels of precipitation that are only seen every 500 to 1,000 years. 
 If ARkstorm does hit, its effects could be exacerbated by the failure of a single piece of infrastructure: the Whittier Narrows Dam in Los Angeles County. 
 A recent report from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) found that ARkstorm could breach the dam, causing water to spill over the top or triggering the premature release of the dam's spillway. The resulting floods and landslides pose an ""unacceptable"" risk to human lives, the report said. 
The Oroville Dam spillway overflows with runoff in February 2017.
 Monica Davey/AFP/Getty Images 
Already, California's flood-protection systems have showed signs of malfunction in places like the Central Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2017, the near-failure of the Oroville Dam outside Sacramento prompted the evacuation of more than 180,000 people. 
 The USACE points to the Whittier Narrows Dam as ""one of the highest risk dams"" in their portfolio. If their models are borne out, around 1.5 million people could be forced to evacuate due to catastrophic flooding, with some areas witnessing floods of up to 20 feet. As weather conditions worsen due to climate change, these predictions could become even graver. 
 Though scientists can't pinpoint when ARkstorm or the next big earthquake will occur, both disasters are considered likely, if not inevitable. 
 But the USGS has found that preparations for the ""next big one"" could help combat a storm as well. 
 By setting up shelters, testing aid agreements, and piloting early warning apps, the state can ready itself for whichever disaster comes first.","Scientists predict that California could be struck by a rare mega-storm that threatens lives and yields $725 billion worth of damage.

BeauHD,"Not everyone is pleased to hear that President Trump has the power to use communications systems in case of an emergency. According to CNET, three New York residents recently filed a lawsuit against President Trump and William Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to halt FEMA's new Presidential Alert messaging system. The lawsuit reads in part : ""Plaintiffs are American citizens who do not wish to receive text messages, or messages of any kind, on any topic or subject, from defendant Trump. [Trump's] rise to power was facilitated by weaponized disinformation that he broadcast into the public information sphere via Twitter in addition to traditional mass media."" From the report: Presidential Alerts are similar to Amber or other emergency alerts on your phone -- you hear a loud noise comes along with vibration. The messages come from the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), which attempts to send the alert to every cell phone within the U.S. operating on a network run by a carrier opting into the Wireless Emergency Alert system. IPAWS is used in the event of natural disasters, acts of terrorism or other disasters or threats to public safety. The plaintiffs' main complaint is that Presidential Alerts are compulsory -- there's no way to opt-out of receiving them. They argue that under civil rights law, government cannot use cellular devices to compel listening, ""trespass into and hijack"" devices without a warrant or individual consent. The plaintiffs are also concerned Trump might use the alerts to spread disinformation because IPAWS doesn't regulate the content of the messages. That means Trump may be free to define ""act of terrorism"" and ""threat to public safety,"" and may broadcast ""arbitrary, biased, irrational"" messages to ""hundreds of millions of people,"" the plaintiffs say in the lawsuit.","Not everyone is pleased to hear that President Trump has the power to use communications systems in case of an emergency.

Raisa Bruner,"Note to those evacuating areas due to storms and natural disasters: when possible, bring your pets with you. That’s the takeaway from recent viral news stories coming out in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence in North Carolina, which are drawing attention to the plight of the animals left behind as owners are forced to flee the flooded region. One journalist, freelancer Marcus DiPaola, put a spotlight on the issue after joining a local rescuer who waded through post-storm waters to help free six dogs who were locked in an outdoor cage where the water was “rapidly rising” in Leland, NC. “We got them out, but by the time we left, the water was so high that they would have drowned,” DiPaola warned in his now-viral tweet, showing the pups clawing at their cage’s door as the rescuers approached. “BRING YOUR PETS WITH YOU!” While DiPaola has said he “came to North Carolina to cover a story, not become the story, for obvious ethical reasons,” the dogs aren’t the only lives he’s helped saved; a feral kitten struggling with the flood waters was also, luckily, in DiPaola’s path. He also documented a family and their dog getting a lift from a dump truck, in a creative use of local vehicles. And then there’s Tony Alsup, a concerned citizen from Tennessee who made a trip to South Carolina to transport a school bus full of over 60 shelter dogs and cats out of harm’s way. Alsup bought the school bus after Hurricane Harvey, and rescuing shelter pets during natural disasters has become something of a hobby. “People don’t believe me, they say it’s got to be barking crazy,” Alsup told a reporter. “But no.”","When pets got left behind during the aftermath of Hurricane Florence in North Carolina, rescuers were on hand to save the day.",2018-09-17T20:07:14Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Video Shows Animals Stranded by Hurricane Florence Got Rescued in Style,http://time.com/5398546/florence-rescue-animals/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/hurricane-florence-rescue-dog.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Natural disasters,1
"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","On Tuesday, NOAA and NASA released their much-anticipated analyses of global climate trends for 2018. As we expected, the agencies confirmed it was the fourth-warmest year on record for planet Earth. But the reports also highlighted just how striking a year it was for the U.S. specifically, with most of the country feeling the heat and various regions experiencing either extreme rainfall or drought.
Across the world, global temperatures were 1.42-1.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the long-term average, placing 2018 behind 2016, 2017, and 2015 as the fourth warmest on record. The U.S.-specific numbers closely mirror the planetary heat wave: Overall, temperatures were about 1.5 degrees higher than the 20th-century average according to NOAA, making it Americas 14th-warmest year. With the exception of the northern Great Plains, which had a relatively average year, most regions of the countryparticularly the West, Southwest, and Southeastwere warm.
 Pockets of the Mid-Atlantic and Southwest saw their warmest year on record when it came to overnight low temperatures, and most of the country saw overnight low temperatures that far exceeded the 20th-century average. Nights, in other words, are getting uncomfortably sweaty for many Americans.
The three-month span from June to August is always the worst season. Its a season of armpit sweat; 
Read more Read
This is one of the most significant and emergent themes in the 21st century, Deke Arndt, chief of the climate monitoring branch for NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information, told reporters on a press call, adding that considering just morning-time low temperatures, the U.S. had its 7th-warmest year on record. This, Arndt explained, is what wed expect in a warming world, where the shrinking of the so-called atmospheric boundary layer at night amplifies warming.
Heat aside, there were also some notable patterns when it came to rainfall or a lack thereof. It was the third-wettest year on record for the country, but the rain didnt fall evenly. In fact, it was concentrated like a bullseye over the Mid-Atlantic, with nine states along the Appalachiansfrom Tennessee to Massachusettsexperiencing their wettest year on record, according to Arndt.
The southwestern U.S. around Four Corners, meanwhile, was desperately thirsty. Most of Utah and Arizona, along with large portions of Colorado and New Mexico, experienced drought conditions all year, continuing what Ardnt described as an entrenched and very intense dry spell that began ramping up in the late 1990s.
The fingerprints of climate change can be seen across this wet-dry seesaw. On the wetter side, a warmer atmosphere can hold and dump more water vapor, and climate scientists predict an uptick in rainfall intensity and total rainfall the Northeastern U.S. as a result. Ardnt called 2018 an exclamation point on a trend were seeing toward more big rain, particularly in the Eastern U.S.
The link between the drought out West and our warming world is a bit more subtle: As Gavin Schmidt, director of NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies, explained on the press call, current precipitation levels arent that unusual when considering the last few thousand years of history. But the drying of the soilwhich impacts not only our crops, but how prone landscapes are to catching fireis the result of both reduced precipitation and warmer temperatures, the latter of which is attributable to increased greenhouse gases, Schmidt said.
The bottom line? Climate change is real, and its effects are coming home to roost. The most sobering statistic from the new report makes that clear: Americans lost $91 billion to weather and climate disasters last year, the fourth-largest total since 1980. While the agencies didnt quantify how much of those losses was attributable directly to a climate change versus where and how we choose to live, theres ample evidence some of these disasters are being amplified in a warming world.
The report comes on the heels of a State of the Union address in which President Trump touted American oil and natural gas production, while failing to mention climate change.","On Tuesday, NOAA and NASA released their much-anticipated analyses of global climate trends for 2018.

Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,"The Camp fire, which killed 86 people and burned the Northern California town of Paradise to the ground in November, was last year’s most expensive natural disaster worldwide, according to a report from German-based global reinsurance company Munich Re. 
The fire, which was the deadliest and most destructive in the state’s modern history, tore through nearly 14,000 homes around Paradise, a rural community about an hour and half north of Sacramento. 
Now the blaze holds another devastating record, according to the report released Tuesday: the costliest natural disaster in 2018. Each year the reinsurer tracks major natural catastrophes and estimates the losses incurred, including to insurers, in its natural catastrophe loss database. 
Natural disasters worldwide in 2018 cost a total of about $160 billion significantly higher than the average over the last 30 years of about $140 billion (adjusted for inflation).  
The Camp fire was the costliest last year, at $16.5 billion in losses, including $12.5 billion of insured losses. The next most expensive disaster was Hurricane Michael, which barreled through Florida in October, killing nearly four dozen people and wrecking entire communities. 
“Our data shows that the losses from wildfires in California have risen dramatically in recent years,” Ernst Rauch, Munich Re’s head of climate, said in a press release. “We have experienced a significant increase in hot, dry summers, which has been a major factor in the formation of wildfires. Many scientists see a link between these developments and advancing climate change.”  
The Camp fire was just one of several record-breaking natural disasters around the world last year that were an indicator of climate change’s effects coming home to roost. 
Multiple hurricanes in the U.S. last year including Michael and Florence hitting within a month and typhoons tearing through Japan and the Philippines were among the major catastrophes that came at a high cost in 2018, according to the Munich Re report.
The Camp fire could come at a serious cost to power company PG&amp;E. Dozens of Camp fire victims have sued the utility for its alleged role in the blaze, saying it did not properly maintain its power lines. Their lawsuit points to PG&amp;E documents that indicated a failing transmission line was in the area where the massive blaze was believed to have started. 
Last month California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the company could face charges as serious as murder or manslaughter for its alleged role in the blaze as well as other wildfires it may be connected to around the state over the past couple of years, The Sacramento Bee reported. 
Meanwhile, on Wednesday, President Donald Trump threatened to cut off wildfire aid to California from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He said in a now-deleted tweet that state officials had to “get their act together, which is unlikely” and improve forest management.",The state’s deadliest fire ever was also the world’s costliest catastrophe in 2018.,2019-01-10T22:02:30Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",California’s Camp Fire Was The Most Expensive Natural Disaster Worldwide In 2018,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-camp-fire-costliest-disaster-2018_us_5c37b1b4e4b045f6768a484f,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c37b3f72500003600c5829b.jpeg?cache=TjriN2afqD&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,Natural disasters,1
Adrienne Breaux,"Well, we try our best, most of the time. But there are some things that are just out of our control. From natural disasters to DIY disasters to science projects that start on the dining room table and spread out to other parts of the home (to work projects that do the same) — sometimes our homes are chaos. And while the ideal situation would be to dig in and deal with the chaos head-on (and clean and organize your heart out), that's not always a possibility thanks to work or family obligations. What to do? Here are few tips to deal when you just can't even. Get out of the house/walk away This is really the first thing you want to do when your home life feels like it's falling all around you and you definitely don't have time to tackle the situation. Does that sound like conflicting advice, to ""deal with things as they happen""? It absolutely is. But again, you just can't always deal with a disaster the moment it's happening thanks to a number of factors. Now if there's an emergency, keep in mind, (if something is flooding or like, animals or vermin are coming in) you should probably dig in and deal, but I think if we're just talking about a big mess or house guests that won't leave, give yourself permission to walk away for a minute or 30. Get mindful and take a walk around your block and focus on your breathing or call out things you see to yourself on as you walk around your neighborhood's streets. It'll help take your mind off your home chaos, which could cut down on the stress of things. But more importantly, if you get away from your problem both physically and mentally, you may find that you come up with a better creative solution to your chaos, a solution that might get you out of chaos even faster than if you had tried to stay in and stay frustrated. Reconnect When's the last time you called your parents? Or that old best friend? It's the same concept as above; you want to get away mentally from your chaos, and reconnecting with friends or family is the best way to do it. Don't call to lament your problems initially — catch up with them and their lives first to get out of your own head and your own issues for a few minutes. Then if the conversation shifts to your chaos, you can approach them with the situation to see if they've got a solution you would have never thought of before. Carve out one small space you can focus in If the chaos is taking over your whole home but you don't have time to tackle everything, try carving out just one spot in your home where you can focus. Maybe a work surface. Maybe a corner of your bathroom. Just try to find one small spot you do have time to clear out so you can try and carve out some mental head space to tackle pressing matters or get some perspective on the home chaos that surrounds you. Go back to your home routines Trust the routines you've set up for yourself and your home. From home cleaning routines to bedtime and morning routines, when life is chaotic you might feel compelled to skew all routines, stay up all night and try to tackle the mess ahead of you. But there's merit in chipping away piece by piece — instead of interrupting your sleep and your life even more, try trusting in the routines you've set up for yourself.","Well, we try our best, most of the time.

Ashley Collman,"Technology is changing the way that emergency responders conduct search-and-rescue operations after hurricanes. When Hurricane Michael ravaged the Florida Panhandle, Amber Gee turned to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maps to see the damage inflicted on her grandmother's property in Youngstown, Florida. What she found was remarkable: a call for ""HELP"" written on the lawn in downed tree branches. Gee alerted rescuers, who found her uncle, aunt, and a family friend hunkering down at the property last Sunday, and brought them to safety. Mike Aslaksen heads the remote sensing division of the NOAA's National Geodetic Survey. Courtesy of Mike Aslaksen It was a feel-good story for Mike Aslaksen, who leads the remote sensing division of the NOAA's National Geodetic Survey. ""I'm happy that there was a happy ending to this,"" he told Business Insider on Tuesday. ""It again really shows some of the multi-use of this data."" The images Gee found came from NOAA researchers taking photos from survey planes that flew over the damaged areas once the hurricane had passed through. The images were then compiled into an interactive map that anyone can search and explore. Aslaksen remembers a similar story coming out of Hurricane Katrina, and is hopeful that the press surrounding Gee's story will lead to others using the tool in future natural disasters. A bird's eye view This technology is hardly new. Aslasksen says NOAA has been taking aerial photos after natural disasters since the 1930s. Typically, the agency sends a single surveying plane up after hurricanes to see what kind of damage the storm has done to the shorelines that might impact nautical travel. FEMA also gives Aslaksen's team special missions to collect images of the destruction inland. Aslaksen shared this image showing the routes the survey plane took after Hurricane Michael. The lines covered the shoreline and a large area north of Panama City, with one line stretching up into Georgia: This maps shows the routes that the NOAA plane took after Hurricane Michael to take pictures of the destruction. NOAA The images taken from the plane are especially helpful at the beginning of the recovery effort, when search-and-rescue teams are reliant on these pictures to see which routes they can take to reach hard-hit areas or whether they need to be helicoptered in. Aslasken said he heard Florida officials used the Hurricane Michael images to determine the best places for helicopters to land in the devastated town of Mexico Beach in order to deliver much-needed food and water. Read more: 25 photos show Hurricane Michael's destruction from the sky A new era of disaster imagery And it's not only hurricanes they're surveying from the sky. The team, which usually includes two pilots and a sensor operator, have also been sent to survey the damage after tornadoes, major floods, earthquakes, nor'easters, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and even man-made disasters like the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. It was September 11th that proved a turning point for the division. Back then, they used film to take their pictures, which meant that it could take up to a week to process the data into a digital format. ""When we interacted with the emergency response community, they really said we need it in 24 hours or we can't use it all,"" Aslaksen said. So his team focused their energies on digitizing their whole process to meet that 24-hour goal. A NOAA aerial picture shows some of the damage done after the Great Alaskan Earthquake of 1964. NOAA They met that goal and then some. In regards to Michael, the team flew their first mission Thursday morning and had their first sets of maps out by 8:30 p.m., just four hours after landing. ""Comparatively, if we had to do that from the high-end work stations that we used to carry, that could be eight to 12 hours,"" he said. Aslaksen credits the quick turnaround to their camera, which does a lot of the processing while they are still in the air, and the cloud system that they upload their photos to, which can upload between 1,500 to 3,000 images in just a matter of hours. ""Our biggest challenge in a lot of cases is just having a good internet connection to upload the data,"" he said. Record-breaking events A view of some of the devastation after Hurricane Irma on the island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. NOAA After years of responding to natural disasters, Aslaksen said four stuck out in particular: Hurricane Katrina, the Tuscaloosa-Birmingham tornado, the US Virgin Islands after Hurricane Irma, and Michael. Aslaksen said it left him awestruck to see before images of the Virgin Islands, totally green, turned to brown after Irma completely stripped the vegetation. ""This really shows you how the impact of these storms can be. When you're told to leave, you need to leave,"" he said. Aslaksen said the records show the events they've surveyed in the last year or two have been more severe.

Associated Press,"Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford, at the Pentagon, April 13, 2018. AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster EIELSON AIR FORCE BASE, Alaska (AP) — The Pentagon is preparing to build temporary camps for immigrants at two military bases, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Sunday. He did not name the two bases, but said the details are being worked out, including how much capacity is needed. The Pentagon had initially talked about four potential bases, but Mattis indicated the number is now two. The Pentagon last week said it would make space available on military bases for as many as 20,000 unaccompanied migrant children detained after illegally crossing the US-Mexico border. It wasn't clear Sunday if the housing would be limited strictly to children or if it would also involve families. Speaking to reporters traveling with him to Asia on Sunday, Mattis said the military has housed people in the past, including Vietnamese fleeing their country as well as Americans needing shelter in the wake of natural disasters. ""We consider that to be a logistics function that's quite appropriate"" for the department, Mattis said. The request for temporary shelter — amid a growing political battle over detained migrants — was made by the Department of Health and Human Services and accepted by the Defense Department. HHS has assessed facilities on four military bases: Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas, plus three bases in Texas: Dyess Air Force Base, Goodfellow Air Force Base and Fort Bliss. The Pentagon has said it will have no role in operating the temporary shelters, which would be controlled by HHS. A Pentagon memo to members of Congress, obtained by The Associated Press, said it has been asked to have the facilities available as early as July, through the end of the year.","AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster EIELSON AIR FORCE BASE, Alaska (AP) — The Pentagon is preparing to build temporary camps for immigrants at two military bases, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Sunday.

Devin Coldewey,"Space is a big place, and mostly empty — but there’s no shortage of objects which, should they float our direction, could end life as we know it. A new national plan for detecting and handling such objects was proposed today, and it includes the possibility of nuclear strikes on the incoming asteroids and other “planetary defense missions.” The plan, revealed and discussed this morning, is far from a joke — it’s just that the scales these threats operate at necessarily elevates the discourse to Hollywood levels. It’s not so much “let’s do this” as “let’s figure out what we can do.” As such it has five major goals. First, improve our ability to detect and track near-earth objects, or NEOs. We’ve been doing it for years, and projects like NEOWise have captured an incredible amount of these objects, ranging in size from the kind that will safely burn up in orbit, to those that might cause serious damage (like the Chelyabinsk one), to proper planet-killers. But we often hear about NEOs being detected for the first time on near-collision courses just days before approach, or even afterwards. So the report recommends looking at how existing and new programs can be utilized to better catch these objects before they become a problem. Second, improve our knowledge of what these objects can and have done by studying and modeling them. Not just so that we know more in general, but so that in the case of a serious incoming object we know that our predictions are sound. Third, and this is where things go a little off the rails, we need to assess and develop NEO “deflection and disruption” technologies. After all, if a planet-killer is coming our direction, we should be able to do something, right? And perhaps it shouldn’t be the very first time we’ve tried it. The list of proposed methods sounds like it was sourced from science fiction: This assessment should include the most mature in-space concepts — kinetic impactors, nuclear devices, and gravity tractors for deflection, and nuclear devices for disruption — as well as less mature NEO impact prevention methods. I wasn’t aware that space nukes and gravity tractors were our most mature concepts for this kind of thing! But again, the fact is that a city-sized object approaching at a significant fraction of the speed of light is an outlandish problem that demands outlandish solutions. And I don’t know about you, but I’d rather we tried a space nuke once or twice on a dry run rather than do it live while Armageddon looms. At first these assessments will be purely theoretical, of course. But in the medium and long term NASA and others are tasked with designing actual “planetary defense missions”: This action includes preliminary designs for a gravity tractor NEO deflection mission campaign, and for a kinetic impactor mission campaign in which the spacecraft is capable of either functioning as a kinetic impactor or delivering a nuclear explosive device. For the latter case, the spacecraft would contain all systems necessary to carry and safely employ a nuclear explosive device, but would carry a mass simulator with appropriate interfaces in place of an actual nuclear device. Designs should include reconnaissance spacecraft and methods to measure the achieved deflection. Actual flight tests “would not incorporate an actual nuclear device, or involve any nuclear explosive testing.” Not yet, anyway. It’d just be a dry run, which serves its own purposes: “Thorough flight testing of a deflection/disruption system prior to an actual planetary defense mission would substantially decrease the risk of mission failure.” Fourth the report says that we need to collaborate on the world stage, since of course NEO strikes don’t exactly discriminate by country. So in the first place we need to strengthen our existing partnerships with countries sharing NEO-related data or studies along these lines. We should all be looking into how a potential impact could affect our country specifically, of course, since we’re the ones here — but that data should be shared and analyzed globally. Last, “Strengthen and Routinely Exercise NEO Impact Emergency Procedures and Action Protocols.” In other words, asteroid drills. But it isn’t just stuff like “here’s where Boulder residents should evacuate to in case of impact.” As the document points out, NEO impacts are a unique sort of emergency event. Response and mitigation actions cannot be made routine to the same degree that they are for other natural disasters such as hurricanes. Rather, establishing and exercising thresholds and protocols will aid agencies in preparing options and recommending courses of action. The report recommends exploring some realistic scenarios based on objects or situations we know to exist and seeing how they might play out — who will need to get involved? How will data be shared? Who is in charge of coordinating the agencies if it’s a domestic impact versus a foreign one? (See Shin Godzilla for a surprisingly good example of bureaucratic paralysis in the face of an unknown threat.) It’s strange to think that we’re really contemplating these issues, but it’s a lot better than sitting on our hands waiting for the Big One to hit. You can read the rest of the recommendations here.","Space is a big place, and mostly empty — but there's no shortage of objects which, should they float our direction, could end life as we know it.

Ingrid Lunden,"Airbnb — the travel startup that lets individuals rent out private homes or rooms in private homes to people as an alternative to hotels — has racked up more than 17,000 nights in its Open Homes program, a voluntary effort where Airbnb hosts can offer their houses and rooms free of charge to people in cities going through an emergency such as a hurricane or flood or other critical incident, either because those people have been displaced from their homes or because they have come to an area to help family go are going through a crisis. Now, the company is piloting a new version of the program to make it even more ubiquitous: Airbnb hosts, and anyone who might be willing to put up people in emergencies, can now register so that they will be available on “standby” lists. The first city that will pilot the new system starting this summer is San Jose, California, and the plan is to roll it out to more cities during the rest of the year, and eventually globally. The idea to expand Open Homes came out of Airbnb thinking about how to make its program more effective and responsive to crises. The company has in total hosted people in nearly 9,000 homes over 90 disasters, but it found that there was a gap in time between when something happened, and the days it would take to recruit volunteers to provide homes. Given the time sensitivity of the need, the company thought it could do something to be more prepared. On the part of the city of San Jose, it became the first city to pilot the program for two reasons. It relied on Airbnb in 2017 to provide homes to people displaced during major flooding, where the city needed to evacuate and find accommodation for 14,000 families, so it understood the benefit of the program. And it generally has a larger impetus to get involved in more tech-led initiatives that better leveraged its own place in the heart of Silicon Valley. “As you might expect, as the biggest city in Silicon Valley, we believe in working in collaboration with tech,” San Jose’s mayor Sam Liccardo said in an interview. “Tech has impacted and changed our economy, but we also know that there is an extraordinary opportunity in having a collaborative approach.” San Jose and Airbnb have worked together before: the city worked with Airbnb on crafting a scheme for taxing hosts to collect visitors’ taxes that were on par with what visitors paid when staying in hotels, and Liccardo noted that this became a template for how Airbnb worked out similar taxes in other cities. While flooding was the reason Airbnb provided Open Homes in San Jose, Liccardo said that earthquakes are by far the more worrisome natural disaster that San Jose wants to be prepared for down the line. Kellie Bentz, Airbnb’s Head of Disaster Response and Relief, says that the company has been working with relief organizations up to now to help coordinate housing options. This new phase of Open Homes will bring it into closer contact with city governments to develop programs. While exact details will be worked out, Airbnb and cities will work together to get the message out to people, since the idea is to appeal to people beyond Airbnb’s own network of hosts. This will include public service announcements and in-person sessions where people can come and learn more about hosting during critical incidents, where they may not get paid, but Airbnb might provide some degree of cost covering for the efforts. Setting up networks of potential hosts ahead of time will allow Airbnb to have more comprehensive data on individual hosts and what their particular offerings and restrictions might be. Bentz is very quick to say that the purpose behind this program is not to cosy up to city governments, or to simply expand its network of regular hosts. But I’d point out that both do happen to be potential (if unintended) side effects. City governments have not always been in harmony with Airbnb, which has run afoul of some local regulations that have been built for hotels and in some cases are only now being modified to account for Airbnb’s brand of travel accommodation. This gives Airbnb a place as not a disruptive aggressor, but a help. In the case of hosts, there have been plenty who have stayed at Airbnb’s but are reluctant to open up their own homes, and this gives the company a way of introducing the concept in a less all-in way. (Although, to be very clear, the company says it is not expanding this program for either of these reasons. “If we weren’t doing this with integrity, I would not be here,” Bentz said.) While the idea is to bring in more than just Airbnb hosts as emergency accommodation volunteers, so far Airbnb hasn’t worked with any other networks that provide a platform to home owners to rent out their places, such as HomeAway. “We would be open to those conversations,” said Bentz. “But so far we have not had interest from them.”","Airbnb — the travel startup that lets individuals rent out private homes or rooms in private homes to people as an alternative to hotels — has racked up more than 17,000 nights in its Open Homes program, a voluntary effort where Airbnb hosts can offer their h…",2018-06-09T18:40:22Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Airbnb will now let people register as Open Homes emergency volunteers before a crisis hits,http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/09/airbnb-will-now-let-people-register-as-open-homes-emergency-volunteers-before-a-crisis-hits/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-90137012.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,Natural disasters,1
