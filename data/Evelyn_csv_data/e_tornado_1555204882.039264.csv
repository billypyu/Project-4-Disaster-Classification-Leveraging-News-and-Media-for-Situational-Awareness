Patrick Allan,"Every year, around 1,200 tornadoes hit the United States, destroying everything in their path. They can form almost anywhere, in any season, and bring with them 300 mph winds and funnels that can be more than a mile wide. This is what you need to know to survive one of Mother Nature’s most brutal offspring. You see those green, billowing storm clouds over there? Those are bad. Not because you’ll get… Read more Read Where and When They Occur Most tornadoes in the U.S. occur east of the Rocky Mountains. They are especially concentrated in the central and southern plains (what’s commonly known as “ Tornado Alley ”), as well as the Gulf Coast and parts of Florida. That said, tornadoes can occur just about anywhere, so it’s good to be prepared for them wherever you live. Once they form, tornadoes tend to move southwest to northeast, but they have been known to change direction. While tornadoes can occur any time during the year, they’re most likely to strike in the spring and summer months. More often than not, they happen in the late afternoon and early evening when the pressure is rapidly changing, usually between 3 and 9 p.m. Know the Warning Signs Tornadoes can strike quickly and seemingly out of nowhere, but there are usually warning signs of some kind. Make sure you know what different weather warnings mean : Severe thunderstorm watch : Weather conditions suggest severe thunderstorms may develop in your area. Severe thunderstorms are an early warning sign of a potential tornado. Severe thunderstorm warning : A severe thunderstorm has been observed by spotters or indicated on radar, and is occuring in your area. These storms can produce rain, lightning, hail, and wind of at least 58 mph. These warnings last for around an hour, or until the storm passes or upgrades to something more severe. Tornado watch : Weather conditions suggest severe thunderstorms are likely and may develop into tornadoes in your area. If you see this warning, review your emergency plans and start preparing for the worst. Tornado warning : It’s happening right now! A tornado has been spotted or indicated on radar in your area, so engage in your emergency plan or take cover immediately. It’s National Preparedness Month, which means it’s time to make sure you’re ready for whatever life … Read more Read If you’re not near your phone, or in an area with poor coverage, there are other tornado signs. Look and listen for : Dark, greenish thunderstorm clouds Dark, low-lying clouds (especially if rotating) Large hail or heavy rain Whirling dust or debris on the ground (tornadoes don’t always have a funnel) Loud, continuous roar that sounds like thunder or a freight train (but never fades away) Knowing these warning signs can save you a ton of time, and time is of the essence in emergency situations. When the Tornado Strikes Once a warning has been issued, or you can see the storm approaching yourself, it’s time to seek shelter immediately. Do not hesitate! Keep in mind, wherever you end up, be sure to protect your head. Most tornado injuries involve flying debris. And never leave a building in an attempt to escape a tornado. You can’t outrun it. If you’re at home Go inside and move to a small interior, windowless room. The lower the room, the better. If you have a basement or cellar, go there. Stay away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. The idea is to put as many walls between you and the outside as possible. Once you’re in a safe room, get under a sturdy table or desk, cover your head and neck with your arms, a heavy coat, a thick blanket, or pillows to protect from debris. If you live in a manufactured or mobile home, leave immediately and head to the closest sturdy building. Mobile homes offer very little protection. Keep pets on a leash or in a crate or carrier. If you’re at work or school Head to a pre-designated safe area, like a safe room, storm cellar, or a windowless interior room. If you are in a high-rise building, head to a small interior room on the lowest floor possible. If possible, avoid any buildings with long-spanning roof areas, like gymnasiums, arenas, or shopping malls. These buildings have a high chance of collapsing from pressure during tornadoes. Follow the instructions of your office safety officer or teacher. Remember when you bought a new can opener because you thought you lost your old one? What do you… Read more Read If you’re in a hotel or airport Hotels may have a basement or other designated safe area. Follow the instructions of hotel staff. Otherwise, seek shelter in interior bathrooms or closets near the center of the building. Protect yourself with pillows, blankets, and mattresses. Be sure to inform management of any injuries or damaged property when it’s all over. If you’re in a concourse or terminal of an airport during a tornado warning, airport staff should guide you to a safe area (often designated tornado shelters). You may be advised to leave your luggage behind, so do as instructed. If you’re in your car or truck Do not try to outrun a tornado—it’s faster than you and doesn’t have to stick to roads. Instead, safely drive to the nearest sturdy-looking building. Once there, park your car outside of any traffic lanes and get inside. If you’re caught inside your vehicle : park, make sure your seat belt is on, put your head down below the windows, and cover your head and neck with a coat, blanket, seat cushion, or your hands. The vehicle’s airbags and frame will offer some protection. Never seek shelter under a bridge or overpass. You’re safer in a low, flat, open location. If you’re outside If reaching shelter in time is not possible, you have a couple of options. If you can get next to a building, do so and crouch next to a strong wall. If you’re totally out in the open, get away from trees, cars, and other potentially deadly debris, then lie face down, flat in a ditch or other low-lying area. Cover your head and neck with whatever you have. After the Tornado If you’re trapped by debris, FEMA recommends you don’t try to move, kick up dust, or push your way out. You may be injured and could make things worse for yourself. Instead, tap on a pipe, wall, or other material that makes a sound. Whistle or yell if you can so rescuers can locate you. When the storm has passed, check in with your family and friends to make sure nobody is hurt. Keep them together during the aftermath. Switch on your radio and listen for instructions from local officials and emergency personnel. Use extreme caution as you begin to clean up. Stay away from debris, damaged buildings, and downed power lines, and watch for broken glass and other sharp objects on the ground. Be sure to wear protective clothing while you handle debris, and don’t try to lift heavy debris by yourself. If your power is out, use flashlights and lamps—not matches, lighters, or candles. You don’t want to have to add a fire onto your insurance claim.","Every year, around 1,200 tornadoes hit the United States, destroying everything in their path.

Do you know how to actually protect yourself during an earthquake or hurricane? What about a… Read more Read Green clouds have long been considered a signal of a coming tornado or hail storm by the people living in Tornado Alley, a large are of the U.S. that spans northern Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and beyond. Traditional folk wisdom says that the ominous color of the clouds comes from all the frogs and grasshoppers the tornadoes sucked up into the sky. How ribbiting! ( Crickets chirp.) But don’t worry, frog and grasshopper lovers, that’s obviously not what’s going on with these scary water vapor behemoths. So why the green? Youtuber and stormchaser Pecos Hank explains that it all comes down to the color spectrum, and the way objects absorb and reflect sunlight: Some of the biggest thunderstorms can generate areas of concentrated heavy rain and hail that look like waterfalls. Storm chasers call this the “core.” Sometimes storm clouds part giving you a glimpse into the core aloft. If you’re underneath the storm base, around midday, the core is often blueish or a gorgeous turquoise. But in the late afternoon and evening when most storm activity occurs, angled golden and reddish sunset light might mix with the blue precipitation core and the net effect is a greenish color. Yellow and blue makes green! William Beasley, professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, agrees. He explains to Scientific American that it all comes down to the moisture particles found in these afternoon thunderstorm clouds. They absorb red light and make the scattered light appear blue. When they’re set against an environment heavy red light, like a low sun during “golden hour” or a sunset, the net effect is a sort of greenish color. Here’s the thing, though: according to physicist Craig Bohre n at Pennsylvania State University, green storm clouds don’t necessarily mean a tornado or hail storm is coming. Basically, a hail storm or tornado can happen with or without green clouds. That’s why it’s important to be prepared for such events and not only rely on what you can see. It’s National Preparedness Month, which means it’s time to make sure you’re ready for whatever life … Read more Read That said, green clouds are a fairly decent predictor of severe thunderstorms in general. Green clouds are often tall clouds, says Scott Bachmeier, a meteorologist at the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at UW–Madison, and tall clouds are a major ingredient for potential hail storms and tornados. So, while seeing green doesn’t mean a tornado is coming, it does mean that a tornado could be coming. No matter what, you’re in for some severe weather, friend. If you’d like to avoid heavy rain, high winds, and lightning, green skies are still a good warning sign to pack it up and get out of dodge. If you see some green clouds coming your way in the afternoon, it’s time to leave the area, or at least go inside where you can easily follow your emergency plan if need be. And if you don’t have an emergency plan yet, you should make one.","You see those green, billowing storm clouds over there? Those are bad.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weather geeks went wild last week when the National Weather Service announced that the Carr Fire near Redding, California had spawned the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado on July 26. And for good reason: Fire tornados are among the rarest weather phenomena on Earth, and this vortex had the added distinction of possibly being the strongest tornado-like thing in California’s history. But more interesting than what we know about the wild-sounding event is what we don’t. Arizona State University fire historian Stephen Pyne told Earther there have been references to fire tornados since the 19th century, but only one other such event has been well-documented to date. Consequently, we have only a basic understanding of how and why fire tornadoes form. We know a lot more about their garden-variety cousins, fire whirls, which form by the dozens on wildfire fronts. (A rather spectacular one was captured by firefighters battling a blaze near Derbyshire, England on Tuesday.) Similar to dust devils, these whirls develop when turbulent, rotating air gets stretched vertically by an updraft. They only last a few minutes, and top out at about 150 feet in height, according to Weather Underground meteorologist and blogger Bob Henson, who penned a detailed explainer about the recent fire vortex. “They’re basically wind shear that gets tilted up,” Craig Clements, director of the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San José State University, told Earther. A fire tornado shares some features with a fire whirl but quite literally takes things to new heights. These rotating columns of air are, by definition, connected both to a cloud system above and the ground below. So-called pyrocumulous clouds (and pyrocumulonimbus thunderclouds) form as hot air rises above a wildfire’s smoke plume, cools, and condenses, creating the potential for a tornado to form. But these clouds typically only emerge at high altitudes due to the intense heat of the flames. What that means is that any vortex connected to both a fire-generated cloud system and the ground is going to be big. According to Clements, the one that formed inside the Carr Fire on the evening of July 26 was associated with a pyrocumulonimbus system that extended tens of thousands of feet up into the stratosphere. Exactly how the tornado-like vortex spun up is still being worked out, and we may never be totally sure. University of Nevada Reno atmospheric scientist Neil Lareau put together an analysis based on Doppler radar data that suggests it formed like a landspout tornado, with an area of horizontal wind shear near the ground getting stretched vertically by a powerful updraft, and eventually connecting with the cloud system above. Others have described the firenado’s formation as similar to that of a more powerful supercell tornado, which are generated by rotating updrafts within thunderstorms. Henson told Earther he thought the vortex could have had elements of both supercell and landspout tornado. “This is definitely about as strong as you’d expect a landspout-type tornado to get,” Henson said. “That’s why it feels like a hybrid to me.” Either way, the vortex was a beast. A preliminary analysis by National Weather Service and CalFire estimated maximum wind-speeds in excess of 143 mph, making it the equivalent of an EF-3 on an intensity scale of 0-5. The twister lasted over an hour, toppling power lines and uprooting trees. To some, the freak event felt like an harbinger of a hotter, more dangerous future. But while climate change is having a clear impact on fire season, connections to rare fire tornado events are more tenuous. As Clements put it, “if it was just climate and fuel driving tornados, every fire would have a tornado.” He suspects that fire tornados come from some combination of loads of vegetation fuel—which generates the intense heat needed to create powerful updrafts—and the right topography. In the case of the very large, very intense Carr Fire (which is still only about 50 percent contained ), air flows racing through gaps in the mountains near Redding in the late afternoon on July 26 might have provided the necessary wind shear to set things off. Clearly, there are a lot of unanswered questions. But future research could help fill in the gaps. Clements’ group uses a mobile weather lab —a 4x4 pickup truck outfitted with a scanning Doppler LIDAR instrument, weather balloon sounding system, and a portable meteorological station—to study fire weather up close. The system has revealed never-before-seen structures inside wildfire plumes and offered insight how pyrocumulous clouds form. And it’s getting an upgrade this fall, with the addition of a Doppler radar-equipped pickup truck that will allow them to detect plumes from farther away and at a higher resolution. But what exactly spawned the Carr Fire’s epic display last month could be an enduring mystery. Clements lamented that by the time his team got to the scene several days later, they were only able to snap photographs. “If we were there [during the tornado], wow,” he said. “That would be a dataset for a lifetime.”","Weather geeks went wild last week when the National Weather Service announced that the Carr Fire near Redding, California had spawned the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado on July 26.

Laura Vitto,"Harrowing new footage released by California's firefighting agency Cal Fire reveals the massive fire tornado that led to the death of a firefighter on July 26. The fire tornado was part of the Carr Fire that's engulfed 223,610 acres of land in Northern California so far. A report from Cal Fire breaks down the details surrounding the fiery phenomenon. SEE ALSO: A fire tornado hit California. Here's how it happened. Per the report, the tornado ""was a large rotating fire plume that was roughly 1,000 feet in diameter at its base"" and managed to reach a height of 40,000 feet. In late July, we covered news of a fire tornado in the area on the evening of July 26. It's unclear whether the fire tornado in the report is the same as the one that garnered media attention at the time, according to Cal Fire. ""Observations from witnesses and other evidence suggest that either several fire tornados occurred at different locations and times, or one fire tornado formed and then periodically weakened and strengthened causing several separate damage areas,"" the report says. Fire tornados can happen when extreme heat spins up from the ground. As Mashable's Mark Kaufman explained at the time: ""The fire tornados could be kicked off by whipping winds interacting with unique terrain and topography, or a spin enabled by the heat itself."" ""Either way, if a small whirl is stoked into a towering firenado, it promptly becomes unpredictable. It's a spinning storm."" Firefighters captured the disturbing video above from a helicopter, as well as footage taken from a fire engine, and from the Keswick Dam on the Sacramento River. The Carr Fire continues to ravage parts of Shasta County and Trinity County. It is 77 percent contained, and other fires continue to rage in Northern California and other areas These fires are spurred on by extreme heat and dryness in the region. While human-caused climate change isn't necessarily the direct cause of any single weather event, like these fires, it can make extreme weather more likely now and in the future.","Harrowing new footage released by California's firefighting agency Cal Fire reveals the massive fire tornado that led to the death of a firefighter on July 26.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Carr Fire is in the record books as one of California’s largest and most destructive fires. But it will also forever live in nightmares for unleashing one of the most terrifying spectacles on Earth in the form of a firenado. On Wednesday, CAL FIRE released three new videos that show the firenado ripping through the Northern California countryside on July 26. The state fire agency also announced that a local fire inspector was killed by the fiery winds. The videos were captured on the ground and from the air by CAL FIRE and local fire departments. They reveal vegetation burning red hot and a tight column of smoke, fire and ash spiraling higher into the sky in what looks like a scene straight out of a horror movie right before a portal to hell opens. But no, this is life on Earth, a reminder that our planet is capable of spinning up terrifying meteorological events all on its own. We know that vegetation burned at incredibly high temperatures, causing air to rise and rotate. And scientists estimate that those firenado winds reached 143 mph, the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado, and spanned an area as wide as three football fields on the ground. But while we know the outlines of what caused it and how serious the damage was, there’s also a ton of open questions about the firenado. That’s because we have precious few examples to compare it to and glean data from. With a paucity of examples and research to draw on, scientists are going to be studying the conditions and aftermath of the Carr Fire firenado for a long time in an attempt to better understand just what happened. The Carr Fire continues to burn, though firefighters have gotten a much better grip on it since the fateful night it tore into the small city of Redding in late July. As of Thursday, the fire was 71 percent contained after charring 214,527 acres, which puts it at the eighth-largest wildfire in state history. But the toll it’s taken has been steep. At least eight have perished, including three firefighters battling the blaze.

Nick Douglas,"I love overly dramatic cover songs, the kind you hear in movie trailers where some lady is stage-whispering He did the mash, he did the Monster Mash while the Inception sound blasts over shots of a robot wizard tornado. I play them in two moods: feeling extremely dramatic and pumped up, or feeling goofy. So I took a few dozen of these songs and I made a dramatic, embarrassing Spotify playlist. Some of these are from trailers, some are featured in actual movies, and some only wish they were. Some are kind of thoughtful, and some might even not sound silly to you. Some dont even sound silly to me, but they sound very silly to my wife. But my wife listens to Hamilton so shes living in a glass house. Some (Beat It) are parodies, and some (Hit the Road Jack) are actually good, and some are bothlike the Auralnauts stupid and beautiful cover of You Spin Me Round, from their YouTube parody of dramatic movie trailers: Some are only half-ironic: the artist Hidden Citizens has made an entire album of cookie-cutter epic trailer versions of pop songs, and I cant tell how much theyre joking. Kytes Sigur-Rós-style Solsbury Hill manages to make the worlds most famous movie trailer song and make it sound even more like a movie trailer song, while still being actually good. Some are better than the original, like Gary Juless Mad World (from Donnie Darko ) or Johnny Cashs Hurt, and ten others that you will defend in the comments. All of these songs are extra, because they use goofy source material, or because they hit every cliché of a dramatic cover, or because they are any non-jazz version of Nature Boy, or because playing a dark version of a happy song is inherently melodramatic. If you watched The Leftovers, you remember cracking up in the middle of a tragic scene as you heard Ive got chills...theyre multiplying... and realized that Damon Lindelof had chosen to soundtrack a divorce with a cover of Youre the One That I Want.

MICHAEL WILSON,"Tornado sightings in New York are rare. From 1950, when the Weather Service began tracking tornadoes in the territory from Long Island to Orange and Putnam Counties, until 1974, not a single confirmed tornado hit the city. Since then, a few have come into the city, including one that hit Brooklyn with winds of up to 135 miles an hour in 2007. The last tornado to hit New York City was in 2012, said Jay Engle, a meteorologist with the Weather Service. On Sept. 8, 2012, tornadoes touched down in Breezy Point, Queens, and Canarsie, Brooklyn, knocking down power lines and sending beachside barbecues and chairs flying.","A tornado touched down in Queens on Thursday, tearing down trees.

ALAN BLINDER and MATT STEVENS,"In Beauregard, a few miles to the south, bundled-up state troopers and sheriffs deputies manned blockades as more blue lights flashed in the distance. The temperature stood not much higher than freezing.
Sheriff Jay Jones of Lee County, speaking to CNN on Monday morning, said,We have not had anything quite like this in our area ever, that I know of.
Alex Miller, 27, was driving with two passengers from Savannah, Ga., to his home in Birmingham, Ala., on Sunday evening when they were alerted on their cellphones that tornadoes might be approaching. They stopped at a gas station in Columbus, Ga., to let one wave of the storm system pass, and continued to head north, hoping to break through the worst of the weather during the lull.
As they neared Smiths Station, Ala., they passed a gas station with a billboard toppled over. They then passed a police blockade diverting southbound traffic off the main roads. The skies darkened, the rain grew stronger all the ominous signs, Mr. Miller said.
The plan quickly pivoted from We need to drive north to We need to pull over and seek shelter immediately, he said.
Mr. Miller pulled into a gas station in Smiths Station and sheltered in a hallway in the back with about 10 other people, including children, and a dog.

Mark Kaufman,"At around 7:00 p.m. PT on July 26, a towering vortex of smoke and flame spun into the California sky. The tornado-like column rose over 16,000 feet into the air. It was a violent night for the Carr Fire, which after preying on profoundly dry forests, breached the Sacramento River and headed into the City of Redding, home to over 90,000 people. There’s no official name for the dramatic phenomena, though “firenado” has become popular. SEE ALSO: California hit with two heat waves in less than a month. Here's why it matters. “I’m not particularly fond of the term,” Brenda Belongie, lead meteorologist of the U.S. Forest Service's Predictive Services in Northern California, who works and lives in Redding, said in an interview. “But it works because of the strength of the fire whirl, the size — and the destructiveness is not unlike the power of a tornado.” The deadly Carr Fire, like many of the fires now burning across the besieged Golden State, was propelled by weather — strong gusty winds and hot temperatures — but enhanced by climate change, which has boosted summer temperatures to record or near-record temperatures around the globe and in Redding. Dominant fire tornados, stoked by incredible heat and other ingredients, have been observed before, but not too often. “It’s relatively rare — but it’s not an unknown phenomenon,” said Belongie, noting that substantially smaller fire whirls can often be spotted amid fires — though not imposing vortices. “What’s really unheard of here is getting it to come down to a population center,” Neil Lareau, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno who studies wildfire plume dynamics, said in an interview. ""Almost every fire has some sort of small whirl."" How did the firenado form? Not every fire has the benefit of burning over grasses, shrubs, and trees — collectively known as fuels — that have been dried-out by extreme heat. ""You have an extreme event in terms of July probably being the hottest July in northern Sacramento Valley on record,"" said Lareau. That further drives down the moisture in the fuels, he noted, making the land more combustible. ""All that energy can be converted into heat,"" said Lareau, which can then rise into the air at speeds of 130 mph. ""This is the mechanism driving these vortices."" The rising air forces the vortex to stretch upward, and spin faster. ""It's the ice skater effect,"" said Belongie, noting how ice skaters pull their arms in to whirl faster. ""It's the same physics."" Here is another radar rendering of the #CarrFire plume during the destructive vortex. The plume undergoes rapid vertical development, growing from 6 to 12 km (19-&gt;39Kft) in 40 min. Thats a lot of stretching and a possible explanation for vortex intensification. #CAwx #CAfire pic.twitter.com/1CTHAvl6Di — Neil Lareau (@nplareau) July 29, 2018 But unlike tornados, which typically form during thunderstorms, these firenados start on the ground level. The sources of the initial spin are ""countless,"" said Lareau. The fire tornados could be kicked off by whipping winds interacting with unique terrain and topography, or a spin enabled by the heat itself. Either way, if a small whirl is stoked into a towering firenado, it promptly becomes unpredictable. It's a spinning storm. ""It’s notoriously difficult to predict what they're going to do because they’re creating they’re own weather,"" said Lareau. ""You’re not sure where the vortex is going to go — it can wander a path with no predictability,"" said Belongie. During a massive fire, such a firenado can come and go. The Carr Fire vortex lasted 80 minutes. It didn't reappear over the weekend — but it very well could have, amid a towering, violent fire, which sent an apocalyptic plume into the sky. ""It's like a big eddy in the whole event,"" said Belongie. As of the morning of July 31 — the Carr Fire's ninth day of burning — it had spread to over 110,000 acres, destroying over 1,200 buildings and making it the seventh most destructive fire in California's history. Less than 30 percent of the fire is contained, and it has claimed six lives. A bright light, amid the whirling flames, leveled homes, and smoke-choked air, are the citizens of Redding themselves. Belongie said people are offering to help complete strangers in grocery stores, not knowing who has lost their home — or worse. ""We take care of ourselves very nicely,"" she said. ""That's just the way we are.""","At around 7:00 p.m. PT on July 26, a towering vortex of smoke and flame spun into the California sky. The tornado-like column rose over 16,000 feet into the air.

SEE ALSO: This super clear video of a nearly perfect tornado is stunning The town of Bondurant, just northeast of Des Moines, saw multiple funnels caught on camera, including one amazing image from a passenger on an incoming flight taken through their airplane window. Thursday's outbreak even caught forecasters with the National Weather Service by surprise. Rod Donovan, with the National Weather Service in Des Moines, told the Des Moines Register, “we were surprised by the unexpected strength of these. The numbers and the strength of these were a little more than we expected.” Forecasters had predicted some strong storms possible with hail and wind being the primary threats.

 A researcher from the Center for Severe Weather Research monitors a thunderstorm in Texas
For a few brief seconds, the rain stopped pummelling the front windscreen of the storm chasers' truck.
Not that the weather was clearing - Kelley Gene Williamson and Randall Yarnall were heading northbound directly towards the storm. At the time, on 28 March 2017, they were covering the event for the Weather Channel programme Storm Wranglers.
As they neared a junction a few miles outside Spur, Texas, a bright red Stop sign came into view on the right-hand side of the road.
Yarnall was driving his Chevrolet truck at about 70mph (113km/h) at the time, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday. A video the friends were live-streaming for the Weather Channel's Facebook page showed they made no attempt to stop at the junction.
The footage cut out a split second before a Jeep driven by Corbin Jaeger drove westbound into the junction. Jaeger, who had the right of way, was driving away from the storm.
Williamson, Yarnall and Jaeger - a respected storm chaser working for the National Weather Service - were all killed on the spot.
The lawsuit, filed by Jaeger's mother, seeks up to $125m (£95m) in damages. It puts the blame firmly at the door of Williamson and Yarnall, whom it calls ""habitually reckless and dangerous"", as well as the Weather Channel.
The lawsuit also alleges that the network's ""concept of presenting storm chasing as an adventurous, thrilling sporting event and to make its two stars 'heroes'"" caused her son's death.
The official history of tornado forecasting began in Oklahoma City in a rather informal fashion.
When a tornado ploughed through Tinker Air Force Base on 20 March 1948, it was the costliest in Oklahoma's history. It destroyed 32 military planes, tossing them across the runway with recorded wind speeds of 78mph (126km/h).
An investigation was launched, and Major Ernest Fawbush and Captain Robert Miller began compiling weather data from before and after the storm - only to realise just five days later that conditions were worryingly similar to those of 20 March.
The base issued the first ever official tornado forecast. Men found cover and aircraft were put away into hangars, before another storm of similar intensity passed through.
Image copyrightAFP/Getty ImagesImage caption
 A tornado bears down on a farm near Wynnewood, Oklahoma, in May 2016
Within just a few years, the Severe Local Storm Warning Center was created to predict storms, based in part on Fawbush and Miller's indicators.
But even then, predictions remained unreliable. Forecasters were often wary to announce storms for fear of causing panic or making people complacent if the storms did not appear. It was only through adopting computers in the 1960s that forecasters' work became more reliable, and as the science of storm prediction became more accurate, storm chasing soon developed into a phenomenon.
David Hoadley is credited as being the father of the pursuit. After a thunderstorm tore through his hometown of Bismarck, North Dakota, in 1956, he began studying and tracking extreme weather across the US.
In a magazine interview, Hoadley described setting off alone to see his first major tornado, driving against a wave of fleeing traffic near Dodge City, Kansas, in 1965.
""It was a moment I'll always remember - the police radio; the patrolman describing some unreal, hypnotic event; the ghostly sirens moaning in the wind; and that classic cone tornado, so close and deceptively graceful as it descended to create a moment of history in the life of a small town.""
In the 1970s, the National Weather Service (NWS) created the Skywarn programme to train storm spotters. After a two-hour training course, volunteers around the country provide reports on dangerous weather and their main responsibility is to inform the service about severe local storms. 
The NWS says there are now about 400,000 trained weather spotters across the US, and while not all chase tornadoes, there has been an anecdotal rise over the past 25 years in the number of people turning out to follow storms. Storm chasers tend to put this down to one event: the release of the film Twister in 1996.
The film, starring Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt, profiles a team of principled but poorly-funded tornado chasers competing against richer rivals. One meteorologist reported that applications to study meteorology jumped 47% in the years after the film was released. 
During the peak tornado season, typically from April to June, hundreds of storm chasers can gather in parts of the Great Plains in the US, especially in states like Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas.
There are now even tour operators who take groups out to chase storms throughout Tornado Alley - a vertical belt across the US where the storms usually form.
But despite the risks of tailing a violent and unpredictable weather system, the first deaths of storm chasers directly attributed to a tornado itself were in 2013.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Oklahoma is one of the states most prone to deadly tornadoes, like this one in 2011
Early in the evening of 31 May that year, a violent weather system produced eight tornadoes near Oklahoma City in a little more than two hours. One proved much more damaging than the others.
The tornado that struck near the town of El Reno was the largest ever recorded - stretching across 2.6 miles (4.2 km) and carrying winds of up to 302mph. The tornado and associated flooding killed 22 people, including four storm chasers.
Three of those were experienced, and known to be responsible, but were caught out when the tornado accelerated and suddenly changed direction. The fourth victim was a local inexperienced storm chaser who drove directly into the tornado's path.
They weren't the only ones around that day. An animation produced by one weather watcher showed how many registered storm chasers were in the path of the tornado as it struck.
Most storm chaser deaths - seven - have been in car accidents, and all but one of those have occurred since 2005.
Even before the fatal collision in Texas in 2017, one meteorologist and storm spotter of 45 years, Charles Doswell, had warned of the risks some chasers were taking while driving after he witnessed the aftermath of one collision.
In a follow-up blog post written after Williamson, Yarnall and Jaeger's deaths, Doswell said he was increasingly concerned about ""chaser hordes"" who were obsessed with getting as close as possible to tornadoes, rather than observing from a safe distance.
""The so-called 'chase community' (which really isn't a 'community' at all, but rather a group of people with a shared hobby) needs to take a long look at their behaviour during their chase activities,"" he wrote. ""If someone has done some irresponsible driving in the past, this might be a good time to resolve to discontinue such practices for good...
""The time is long overdue to get serious about ceasing illegal and unsafe driving during a storm chase [or any other time, for that matter!]. No one gets a free pass on the roads, and this includes people chasing for TV.""
The Weather Channel is not alone in broadcasting thrilling documentaries chronicling the lives of storm chasers: the Discovery Channel, National Geographic and the BBC, among many others, have done so too.
But the lawsuit against the Weather Channel alleges that the network had been warned by other storm chasers about Williamson and Yarnall's ""history of reckless driving"". It also says that their failure to stop at the junction where the collision occurred was their fourth traffic violation that day.
""Instead of using meteorologists experienced in the tracking of tornadoes,"" the lawsuit says, the Weather Channel ""knowingly chose two chicken farmers and cattle ranchers from Missouri without any emergency/first responder or meteorological training to star in their show.
""TWC then instructed them to barrel into dangerous weather conditions to obtain footage, needlessly endangering local residents fleeing impending catastrophe.""
The channel told the BBC it could not comment on pending litigation.

Meteorologists and storm chasers appear split over whether televised storm chasing is increasing risks to people on the ground, and whether those live-streaming tornadoes for television are providing a valuable service or not.
Jeff Frame, of the University of Illinois' Department of Atmospheric Sciences, says forecasters often watch live streams to understand a storm's changes in real time. Images distributed from the scene on social media are often ""extremely helpful"" for those who need to issue warnings, he adds.
But meteorologist Ryan Maue says he could see ""no net benefit to live storm chasing on TV"" and that ""the risk to chase the storms may outweigh the arguably minimal extra information provided"" to forecasters.
Tour operators say they warn groups about the dangers of what Kim George at Tempest Tours calls ""citizen chasers"", which she says is ""a greater issue every year"".
""When you have too many people going down the same roads it can be difficult to stop and move off the road,"" she says. ""We have a radar that shows where most of the chasers are converging and we avoid those areas.""
A spokesperson for Cloud 9 Tours agrees, advising people ""to look both ways before crossing the road - even if it's a one-way road"". 
""Other chasers may be focused on the storm and not watching the road ahead of them.""
For Dr Frame, who will take a group of students to the Great Plains in May and June, the number of people storm chasing is not the problem - this has remained fairly constant since the mid-2000s, he says.
The bigger problem, according to Dr Frame, is bad driving from chasers who are either distracted by the storm, do not park far enough off the road to keep it clear, or who do not rest sufficiently before chasing.
""I would say it is a few bad apples,"" he says. ""Most storm chasers are safe.""
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 The aftermath of a 2013 tornado in Moore, Oklahoma, where 24 people were killed
Captain Paul Timmons agrees. He has worked for the Oklahoma Highway patrol for three decades and he says chasers typically don't cause problems on the roads.
""It kind of depends on the season,"" he says. ""There are some people who go out storm chasing just to get a closer view of a tornado or a hail storm, and they end up having to ride it out.""
""Leave it to the professionals,"" he advises. 
Dr Frame also says that problems are likely to occur among inexperienced chasers who are more likely to panic when they find themselves trapped by a storm that changes direction suddenly. Inexperienced chasers should look to buddy up with someone who better understands storm systems, he says. 
Controlling crowds of enthusiasts is not the answer, Ryan Maue says: simple good, sensible behaviour is.
""Special laws are not required in the US to regulate storm chasing,"" he says. ""The activity is entirely legal as long as one adheres to appropriate traffic laws, stays in a safe position with respect to the storm, and does not waste the time of emergency responders by blocking roads. 
""Common sense goes a long way and this tragedy in Texas could have easily been prevented.""",A lawsuit claims reckless behaviour by storm chasers before a fatal crash.

Images of significant damage to homes and trees in the area quickly started appearing on social media as well as via local news agencies. There are no reports of any injuries at this time.
(Related: Tornado safety tips)
The NWS will send a survey team on Wednesday morning to asses the damage and classify the intensity of the storm. ""Until we conduct a tornado survey tomorrow morning, we can not speculate on the strength of the tornado,"" the weather agency said via Twitter.

RARE STORM
While tornadoes occur in every month of the year in the United States, they aren't particularly common in the Pacific Northwest, and especially not in December. Washington averages only 2.5 tornadoes per year. If Tuesday's tornado is rated EF-2 or higher, it would become the first 'significant' tornado (those EF-2 or higher) in Washington state since 1986, and the first significant December tornado in the state since 1969. Even more unusual: if the storm is rated EF-2 (or higher), Washington state will match Texas for the number of EF-2 storms in December -- 1. Washington state has no EF-4 or EF-5 tornadoes on record. 
TORNADO TOUCHES DOWN NEAR SEATTLE
Within the affected area, trees are down and power lines are in the roadways. Please avoid the area. PUD is working to clear lines and restore power. 
No injuries have been reported so far, but we are continuing to contact residents. #PortOrchardTornadopic.twitter.com/wA6w84CTXF

 Rescue crews will work through the night to save people from the rubble
At least 14 people, some children, have been killed after tornadoes struck Lee County, Alabama, authorities said. 
Sheriff Jay Jones told local news outlets they were still pulling people from the rubble, and some had been hospitalised with serious injuries. 
""The challenge is the sheer volume of the debris where all the homes were located,"" he told CNN. 
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey posted on Twitter to warn residents there could be more extreme weather to come. 
""Our hearts go out to those who lost their lives in the storms that hit Lee County today,"" she wrote. 
The National Weather Service (NWS) classified the first tornado to strike as at least an EF-3 - meaning winds of up to 165 miles per hour (266km/h). 
Sheriff Jones described the damage as ""catastrophic"", saying one tornado cut a path of destruction quarter of a mile (0.4km) wide and several miles long. 
Tornado watches were in effect in parts of Alabama and in Georgia on Sunday evening. 
Alabama meteorologist Eric Snitil tweeted that there were more deaths in Lee County in one day due to a tornado than in the entirety of the US in 2018. 
More than 10,000 people are without power, according to the local press.
The National Weather Service said it would send three survey teams to assess the damage caused by tornados across the state on Monday.
All schools in Lee County will be closed on Monday, the school district announced.","Reports say at least 10,000 people are without power, and there could be more bad weather to come.",2019-03-04T01:53:11Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}","Tornadoes kill at least 14 in Lee County, Alabama",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47436809,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B781/production/_105877964_052727162.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tornado,1
Andrew Freedman,"The weather in the Plains states has been anything but normal lately. Oklahoma — a state synonymous with tornadoes — didn't have a single twisters through April 30, a new record. Instead, states from Texas north to Nebraska have been dealing with dust storms and sprawling, fast-moving grass fires as unusually dry weather has taken its toll on the region. That tornado and precipitation drought changes on Tuesday, as a complex series of storm systems unleashes several rounds of severe thunderstorms across the region. SEE ALSO: Epic deluge in Hawaii may have broken all-time U.S. rainfall record, with 4 feet in 24 hours The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) — the arm of the National Weather Service responsible for issuing severe thunderstorm outlooks — issued a ""moderate risk"" outlook for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday. In the outlook, the SPC highlighted a small area of Kansas at greatest risk of storms that could bring large hail, damaging winds, and a few potentially strong tornadoes. Plot of annual tornado count, adjusted to remove overcounting from multiple sightings of the same tornado. 2018 is in black. Image: noaa spc. ""Tornadoes, a couple of which could be strong, very large hail, and damaging winds will be possible,"" the SPC stated on its website. Severe thunderstorms are also expected to flare up in Nebraska and Iowa on Tuesday afternoon and evening. Other areas, outside of Kansas, are also at risk for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday, even if forecaster confidence is lower. These places include Texas and Oklahoma, northward into Iowa. One limiting factor for storms, and a forecasting wild card, is the recent dryness that has contributed to the dire fire weather conditions in the past several weeks. Fires singed more than 350,000 acres in Oklahoma, killing more than 1,000 cattle. Fires are still burning in Oklahoma and Kansas today, at the same time the atmosphere is threatening to unleash a totally different type of hazard. While moisture from the Gulf of Mexico has flowed northward into the heart of what is commonly referred to as ""Tornado Alley,"" the dryness of soils in these states could act to inhibit the formation of severe storms. The threat of severe weather will ramp up on Wednesday and linger into Thursday as a series of storms dives into the Southwest, and moves across the Plains and Midwest. By Friday, it's quite possible that Oklahoma will have recorded its first tornado of the season. While tornado season usually peaks during the next few weeks, the same weather pattern responsible for the extraordinarily chilly April across much of the U.S. helped put a lid on severe storm activity up until now. Mother Nature has a lot of catching up to do if the season is going to turn out to be close to average.","The weather in the Plains states has been anything but normal lately.

Andrew Freedman,"Tornadoes are such a rare weather phenomena that they attract hundreds, if not thousands, of storm chasers to the Great Plains each spring and early summer, in the hope of glimpsing one of these beasts. Tornadoes, which are not their own cloud type, protrude from another rare, rotating cloud, known as a wall cloud. In fact, some tornadoes are not completely visible from the ground to the base of the parent thunderstorm, due to a lack of moisture. Tornadoes, too, come in all shapes and sizes. There are stovepipe funnels, rope tornadoes and the dreaded wedge, to name a few. All of these are bad news. The U.S. was spared a major tornado disaster in 2016, but was not so lucky in previous years, particularly in 2011, when 1,691 tornadoes touched down, killing 550 people. Yet for all the advances in tornado prediction, we still don't know the exact, micro-scale sequence of events that gives rise to such calamities. The allure of the unknown is what drives many storm chasers to the Plains each spring and summer. Some are scientists gathering data to try to save lives. Others are thrill-seekers through and through. Many chasers come face-to-face with the damage these storms can cause.","To many, clouds are merely part of the backdrop in a typical day.

 A Tornado came within close proximity of a drone over Suffolk
An RAF Tornado travelling at 517mph (832km/h) came within 22m (72ft) of hitting a drone, a report has revealed.
The jet, which was flying in formation 10 miles (16km) north-east of RAF Wattisham in Suffolk, did not see the remote-controlled aircraft, according to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
The drone pilot, which reported the incident, said there was a high risk of collision.
The CAA Airprox board's report said ""safety had been much reduced"".
The drone, which was carrying out an agricultural survey, was at an altitude of 100m (328ft) while the jet was at 121.9m (400ft) when the near-miss took place on 4 July.
The Airprox board said this, combined with a lack of visual warning, had resulted in ""a significant and largely unmitigated safety risk"" and recommended that RAF Air Command uses a system to receive notification of commercial drone operations.
While the drone operator was not required to inform RAF Wattisham of their plans, Air Command said they could have done so considering the proximity of the base. 
It praised the drone pilot for descending the aircraft once the Tornados had been detected.
However, the report said that while the drone operator had reacted swiftly, the speed of the Tornado meant there was little that could have been done to avoid a crash.
London Gatwick Airport was brought to a standstill last week when drones were sighted, while another Airprox report revealed a Boeing 737 came within 15m (50ft) of a drone while coming into land at Stansted in August.",A report on the incident is recommending the RAF uses a system to warn it of drone flights.,2018-12-24T06:29:28Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Farm drone in near-miss with air force jet,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-46633952,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10B57/production/_104893486_raftornado2.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tornado,1
ALAN BLINDER,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. Days after ferocious tornadoes killed almost two dozen people and devastated block after block of eastern Alabama, officials warned Wednesday that the state should brace for the possibility of more trouble this weekend.
We have another storm system, very powerful, that will begin entering the state on Saturday, Kevin Laws, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said at a news conference in the county where 23 people were killed on Sunday. Most of the entire states going to be under a significant risk.
The Weather Services Storm Prediction Center issued a separate forecast that showed much of the South, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and the Carolinas, in at least some jeopardy over the weekend. Meteorologists, who predicted Sundays outbreak with striking precision, are expected to refine their forecast in the coming days.
Mr. Laws said there was a possibility that the eastern half of Alabama, which includes the communities that were hit hardest last weekend, would ultimately face somewhat more of a minimal risk.","The authorities in Lee County, Ala., where 23 people were killed, said no one remained missing.

,"At a Glance Four people were injured when a likely tornado hit Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base Sunday afternoon. The same storm system slammed the town of Taylorville, Illinois, on Saturday, injuring 25 people. Tornadoes also caused major damage in parts of Oklahoma. One person was killed when an EF1 tornado struck near Auroro, Missouri. A storm system that tore across the Plains Friday into Saturday morning brought severe thunderstorms and a likely tornado to southeast Georgia on Sunday. Tornado warnings were issued for Camden County, which includes Kingsland, St. Marys and Cumberland Island, Georgia. Tornado warnings also were issued for Nassau County in northeast Florida. Action News Jax said injuries were reported at the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base near Kingsland, about 4 p.m Sunday. Reporter Ryan Nelson said he spoke with the mother of one of the injured people. Nelson said she told him her son had been fishing when the storm hit and that he had been taken to a hospital. Scott Bassett, a public information officer at the base, told weather.com that no submarines were damaged in the storm. He said there was wind damage to a pier facility in the southeast part of the base where smaller Coast Guard vessels dock. One of those boats flipped in the storm, Bassett said. He also said the storm knocked down utility poles and flipped vehicles. Later Sunday, another public information officer, Chris Tucker, told First Coast News that four people had been injured in the storm. Tucker said their injuries were not severe, but they were taken to a local medical facility where they were treated and released. The same system had spawned a tornado Saturday that left more than 100 homes damaged and 25 people injured in Taylorville, Illinois. The tornado struck the town of about 11,200 residents just after 5 p.m. Saturday. (MORE: Destructive Tornado Strikes Taylorville, Illinois; 25 People Hurt, Over 100 Buildings Damaged ) The storm system also was responsible for at least four tornadoes that caused extensive damage in Oklahoma and killed one person in a southwestern Missouri. Fire Chief Robert Ward told KYTV that one person inside an Aurora, Missouri, motel was killed as a storm passed through. The National Weather Service confirmed an EF1 tornado in the area. An EF0 was confirmed to have hit Monett, Missouri. Authorities have not released the person's name or details of how the death occurred. A tornado was reported near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, around 9:30 p.m. CST. Widespread damage was reported around the Lake Tenkiller area as the storm tracked on towards Arkansas. The storm was accompanied by a strong tornado debris signature, indicating that significant damage may have occurred for some time. As daylight arrived Saturday, extensive damage could be seen from social media posts, including damage to the Snake Creek Marina at Lake Tenkiller. ""There's nothing left. No marina. Nothing. My boat's gone and everything is gone,"" Michael Martin told KOTV. ""This is devastating right here. I mean few of the docks have been torn up, but these are destroyed. There aint nothing left down there."" Law enforcement reported several homes damaged in the town of Tenkiller, according to ABC 4029 News. Sequoyah County Sheriff Larry Lane told the news station a family trapped in a storm cellar by a downed tree was rescued. In Gore, Oklahoma, three homes were damaged, one severely, and in Aurora, a car dealership sustained heavy damage. (MORE: Severe Thunderstorm Threat: Timing Locations ) Several homes were damaged in Van Buren, Arkansas. In Missouri, a wind gust to 83 mph was recorded near Republic, and in Ridgedale, the top two Floors of D'Monaco Resort sustained significant damage, the National Weather Service reported. No injuries have been reported. On Sunday, the National Weather Service confirmed that two tornadoes had hit Oklahoma on Friday. Webber Falls saw an EF-1 tornado that traveled about 7 miles. The tornado that hit near Lake Tenkiller was an EF-2 that traveled about 25 miles and had top winds of 125 mph. An area of low pressure moved into the southern Plains Friday night and intensified, said weather.com meteorologist Linda Lam. This system combined with mild and moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to produce strong to severe thunderstorms Friday night from northern Texas into southern Missouri. This system will continue tracking eastward and will bring the risk of severe storms, with damaging winds, hail and isolated tornadoes, to parts of the South and Midwest, possibly as far north as central Illinois and central Indiana on Saturday, Lam said.","Sacramento Bee Georgia Naval Base Struck by Likely Tornado; Illinois Town Takes Direct Hit, One Dead in Missouri The Weather Channel A storm system that tore across the Plains Friday into Saturday morning brought severe thunderstorms and a likely tornado to s…",2018-12-02T22:28:24Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Weather.com'}","Georgia Naval Base Struck by Likely Tornado; Illinois Town Takes Direct Hit, One Dead in Missouri - The Weather Channel",https://weather.com/news/news/2018-12-02-storms-tornadoes-kings-bay-georgia-plains-oklahoma-missouri-arkansas,https://s.w-x.co/gatornado.jpg,,Weather.com,tornado,1
John Newsom,"GREENSBORO — A motorist was killed when a tree fell on his car and hundreds of homes and businesses in Greensboro were damaged Sunday afternoon as a suspected tornado raced from south to north along the city's east side. The tornado, not yet confirmed, was first spotted near U.S. 29 and East Gate City Boulevard about 5:15 p.m. on a rainy, cloudy afternoon. Roughly 15 minutes later, a second suspected tornado was reported in the Monroeton community southwest of Reidsville. City Manager Jim Westmoreland told reporters Sunday night that the National Weather Service has not yet confirmed that a tornado struck the city. Weather service officials will be here Monday to determine whether to blame the death and damage on straight-line winds or a tornado. Greensboro police said Anthony George, 48, of Greensboro was killed at 5:46 p.m. when a tree fell on his moving BMW at East Cone Boulevard and Ceasar Street. Two other people were injured in the same incident: Renee George, 49, a passenger in the BMW; and Becky Combs, 48, of Liberty, who was driving a Dodge Avenger that was hit by the same tree. Neither woman suffered life-threatening injuries. No other people were reported injured during or after the fast-moving storm. Emergency personnel are going door-to-door Sunday night in affected areas to make sure there are no other deaths or injuries. The weather service warned of tornadoes all Sunday afternoon, which turned cloudy and then rainy. And then the rain fell harder and the wind started to blow. ""It was real quiet and calm and then the wind picked up and it went downhill from there,"" said Kay Cassidy, whose backyard fence at her South English Street home was a casualty of the storm. Damage was extensive on Greensboro's east side and in pockets of Rockingham County. In Greensboro, the worst of the damage occurred in a four-mile line that stretches roughly from Barber Park to Phillips Avenue. Multiple city streets are closed because the storm knocked down numerous trees and power lines. Guilford County Schools will be closed Monday because of extensive damage and power outages at 15 schools and the Franklin Boulevard administrative offices. Three schools — Erwin, Hampton and Peeler Open elementaries — sustained severe damage. At Hampton Elementary, the storm destroyed the mobile units parked next to the Trade Street school. LaToy Kennedy, Hampton's principal, said she hoped her students and their families are OK. ""We're a family,"" she said. ""We'll get through this together."" Elsewhere in Greensboro, the storm tore off part of the roof of the McGirt-Horton Branch Library on Phillips Avenue. On Rankin Mill Road, a car wash lost its roof. On South English Street, an apartment complex also lost part of its room. The storm turned vehicles upside down on Phillips Avenue. Numerous homes were damaged, some badly, throughout the city's east side. On Sunnycrest Avenue, several men were preparing for a Masonic lodge initiation ceremony as the storm approached. They left the lodge before the winds kicked up. They watched from a distance as the storm toppled the cinderblock building. Mary Rogers was returning home from a neighborhood convenience store when she saw the tornado. She sought shelter in a neighbor's house. The neighbor is usually asleep in the afternoons, Rogers said. On this day, the neighbor was awake and let her in. ""I saw everything from the back door of my neighbor's house,"" Rogers said. At Rogers' home nearby, Andrew, her 10-year-old son, was watching TV. A piece of debris shattered the window in the room where he sat. Next door, a tree crashed through the roof above another neighbor's kitchen. Walter Jones, whose Avalon Road home backs up to Hampton Elementary, said he heard a loud rumbling noise and took shelter with his family in a hallway in the middle of the house. Then he heard a cracking sound. After the storm had passed, he found a large wooden beam sticking through the front wall of his house. T.J. Johnson was asleep when his mother called to warn him about the approaching storm. His home in the Briarwood neighborhood, where he has lived for 20 years, was spared. But several others nearby houses were damaged. ""I heard the rain,"" he said, ""but I didn't know (the tornado) was right here in my neighborhood."" On Rankin Mill Road, Coty Shelton, 24, inspected a car wash that lost its roof in the storm. Nearby, the car vacuums stood unmolested. Shelton lives on Hicone Road, not far from the damaged business. The tornado, he said, ""didn't come that far, luckily."" About 23,000 Greensboro homes and businesses were without power as of about 10 p.m. Sunday. Westmoreland said the city got about 1,000 calls for service from residents between 5 and 8 p.m. Sunday. Rail service was delayed by trees that fell on the tracks near Holts Chapel Road. The American Red Cross has set up an emergency shelter at Glenwood Recreation Center at 2010 Coliseum Boulevard. Pets are allowed. For people without cars, city buses will run to the shelter from Dudley High School and the intersection of East Market and English Street. City Councilwoman Sharon Hightower, whose district was hit hard by the storm, said it will take time to turn the power back on and clean up city streets. ""Tell each neighbor to be patient,"" she said. ""I know it can be frustrating."" In eastern Guilford County, the tornado’s touch on McLeansville Road was brief but brutal. A silo was lifted in the air and hurled from one side of the road to the other. A shed was toppled. Shingles were scattered. Trees were split almost down to their roots. In all, the storm cut a half-mile swath of destruction that residents say took them by surprise. And in the time it takes you to finish this sentence, it was gone. “It hammered us,” resident Steven Glass said. “No warning. We scattered to take cover. It was crazy. “We’re all lucky to be alive.” As night fell Sunday, and power was out on a portion of this rural road, residents gathered with flashlights in front yards a little shaken but grateful they survived. Comparing notes, they recalled the chill in the air moments before touchdown. Winds gusting. And then a torrential downpour. “It was so thick, you couldn’t see cars,” resident Josh Rumley remembered. Jeff Roberson, in from Las Vegas to visit his father, said there was just no time to react. “I didn’t hear it coming,” said Roberson, 48. “All of a sudden, the house started shaking. You saw trees flying. It went through pretty damn hard — and fast. “We were scared half to death.” In Rockingham County, county emergency officials said several people were hurt in the storm. None of their injuries are life-threatening. Two of the injured were driving on Grooms Road when their vehicle was struck by a mobile home blown across the street. County emergency officials also said the most severe damage was reported east of Reidsville. They said homes along Grooms Road, Frank Road and Rocky Ford Road were the hardest-hit. Several other homes along U.S. 158 West between Garrison and Chapmon roads, northeast of Reidsville, sustained severe damage. Elsewhere in North Carolina, severe storms caused the Charlotte airport to close briefly. Television stations in Charlotte posted images of large hail on Twitter, and the National Weather Service received reports of golf ball-sized hail in several counties.",Greensboro News & Record Suspected tornado kills 1 in Greensboro; damage extensive on city's east side Greensboro News & Record GREENSBORO — A motorist was killed and hundreds of homes and businesses in Greensboro were damaged Sunday afternoon as a suspected …,2018-04-15T22:18:57Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Greensboro.com'}",Suspected tornado kills 1 in Greensboro; damage extensive on city's east side - Greensboro News & Record,http://www.greensboro.com/news/local_news/suspected-tornado-kills-in-greensboro-damage-extensive-on-city-s/article_3fa1e99a-5bed-57d8-8f2f-010f944a75ec.html,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/greensboro.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/0e/30e1454b-c1f2-5568-b518-fac84ba5dee1/5ad414864a4e3.preview-100.jpg?crop=87%2C65%2C6%2C0&resize=267%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize,,Greensboro.com,tornado,1
Advocate staff report,"Storms ripped through much of Louisiana on Saturday, and forecasters indicated a tornado might have been the cause of damage in the Baton Rouge area. The storms prompted thunderstorm and tornado warnings in many parishes throughout the day. The National Weather Service reports the possible tornado occurred about 8:13 a.m. in the area of Industriplex Boulevard and Airline Highway in Baton Rouge. Damage was located in the parking parking lot. There was also a report of a tree on a home in Baton Rouge. Can't see video below? Click here. The possible tornado twisted and snapped at least three trees on the grounds of Woman's Hospital near the corner of Airline and Industriplex. Across the street the sign for Fit Blendz was blown off and tossed onto Pecue Lane, which turns into Industriplex at Airline. Two Fit Blendz employees said besides a few tossed shingles the building didn't sustain any damage, and no one was hurt. There were also multiple reports of downed power lines, trees and street flooding in the morning, but all roads were cleared by early Saturday afternoon, according to the city-parish Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Twitter account. A couple thousand Entergy customers were left without power between Airline Highway and Interstate 10 by Bluebonnet Boulevard and Siegen Lane around 8 a.m., but officials estimate that it will be restored by 10 p.m. Saturday, according to the online outage map. There were additional outages throughout the Baton Rouge area. In Tangipahoa Parish, a possible tornado also occurred about 8:40 a.m. in the N. Amite area.

"Madeline Holcombe, CNN","(CNN)Three days after a string of tornadoes struck the Southeast, Alabama rescue teams are looking toward recovery and the families of those who died in the storms are preparing to lay their loved ones to rest.
Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones told reporters on Tuesday that heavy equipment is being used to clear debris and that the search and rescue mission will soon move to a recovery status.
Meanwhile, two corporations are stepping in to pay for the funerals of all 23 tornado victims in Alabama.
Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told CNN affiliate WTVM on Tuesday that both corporations wish to remain anonymous.
""What a wonderful blessing this will be for the families who have lost loved ones! To these corporations we thank you!"" the Lee County Sheriff's Office said on Facebook.
Four tornadoes hit central Alabama on Sunday, the National Weather Service in Birmingham said. They left a trail of destruction in their path.
It looked ""as if someone had taken a blade and just scraped the ground,"" Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said.
Harris said that of the 23 people who died in the storms, four were children. Those killed ranged in age from 6 to 89. 
For some, the pain of loss is being feltmany times over.
Erroll Reese told CNN affiliate WRAL that he lost seven members of his family to the tornadoes, and that at least 30 more now are without a home.
Reese told the station in a Monday night interview that fifteen of his family members lived on the same street in a lower middle-class area.
""It's devastating when you think about it,"" Reese said. ""I was sitting there just a while ago thinking, 'How do you handle this, what do you do, who do you reach out to?' And before I knew it, people were reaching out to me trying to help.""
In another family, Makitha Griffin lost five of her family members to the tornadoes.
Her aunts, Florel Tate Stenson, 63, and Tresia Robinson, 62; her uncles, Henry Lewis Stenson, 65, and Raymond Robinson Jr., 63; and her cousin 38-year-old Eric Jamal Stenson were among the nearly two dozen victims of the tornadoes.
A cousin who was in the same house as those killed sustained injuries and is now hospitalized, Griffin said.
Since Monday, Griffin has been feeding first responders who are searching for the missing and helping those who lost their homes. 
She says that growing up, she learned the importance of community.
 ""Everybody was still family whether they were related or not,"" she said. ""We gotta help our families.""
Children among the victims
Taylor Thornton, a fourth grader at Lee-Scott Academy, was also among those killed, Stan Cox, the head of the school, confirmed to CNN after meeting with her parents.
""Very inquisitive, she loved learning and always contributed in a positive way,"" Cox said. ""People were better because they were with her and now our school feels empty without her.""
The youngest victim was Armando Hernandez, 6, family member Sara Crisp said.
Armando, AJ to his family, was described as ""a precious little man that was loved by everyone,"" and who ""was always eager to give hugs and loved his family,"" according to a post on Facebook by his aunt Tina Melton.
Cousins Johnathan Marquez Bowen, 9, and Mykala Waldon, 8, were also killed in the tornado.
Johnathan's mother, Shamel Hart, told reporters at a news conference about the loss of two children in the family, according to CNN affiliate WRBL.
""I did a fireman carry over some trees, and when we got there there was a man in a truck, and he jumped out with a chainsaw and started plowing through trees to make a path for my cousin and me to bring our babies to him. He helped with CPR and transport,"" cried Hart.
As of Tuesday, officials said, the number of missing was seven or eight. 
Dozens of people were injured, with 77 patients from areas affected by the tornadoes hospitalized on Sunday.
Six adult patients remain hospitalized at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, spokeswoman Holly Gainer confirmed to CNN.
Four other patients remain hospitalized at East Alabama Medical Center, according to hospital spokesman John Atkinson.
Lee County Emergency Management Agency director Kathy Carson told reporters at a Tuesday briefing that there has been an outpouring of offers of assistance. She said authorities are organizing a volunteer reception area for those who want to help.
Residents who've lost their homes can get shelter, food and medications, she said.
""We're here for the citizens. We cannot emphasize enough that we want them to communicate and let us know what they need,"" Carson said.
President Trump said he plans to visit Alabama on Friday.
""It's a tragic situation but a lot of work is getting done"" in tackling the storm damage, he said Tuesday at the White House.
The National Weather Service in Birmingham confirmed that four tornadoes hit central Alabama on Sunday. 
Tornadoes are measured on the Enhanced Fujita scale from 0 to 5 based on intensity and damage caused.
Three of the tornadoes were categorized as EF-1, but the Beauregard-Smiths station in Lee County was an EF-4 with winds of 170 mph.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey has extended the state of emergency that had been issued last month because of tornadoes and severe weather and made a request for a federal major disaster declaration.
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency in Grady, Harris and Talbot counties, in the southern part of the state, where he said almost two dozen homes were destroyed and up to 40 sustained damage.
CNN's Pierre Meilhan, Christina Maxouris, Joe Sterling, and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Three days after a string of tornadoes struck the Southeast, Alabama rescue teams are looking toward recovery and the families of those who died in the storms are preparing to lay their loved ones to rest.",2019-03-06T10:59:43Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Alabama turns its attention to recovery efforts and funerals for the 23 tornado victims,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/06/us/alabama-tornadoes-wednesday-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190305143021-16-tornado-0304-alabama-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,tornado,1

Second Severe Weather Season Although the threat of tornadoes is generally highest in the spring, fall is considered the second severe weather season. The highest threat of tornadoes in November is from eastern Texas into Alabama, which is included in the area to watch this week. This is due to southward dips in the jet stream and cold fronts that track across the South and Midwest, where warmer temperatures and higher dew points are more likely to be found in November compared to areas farther north. The average number of tornadoes in the U.S. in November from 1991-2015 is 56.

"Lorraine Allen on Offspring, shared by Lorraine Allen to Lifehacker","If you struggle to clip your toddlers nails, youre not alone. Its a necessary, frequent task, dreaded by many parents. We first failed so miserably at keeping our infant daughters sharp little claws under control that I showed up at her one-month check-up with clippers in hand and begged the nurse and pediatrician to help me out; they refused. 
When our second kid spent some time in the NICU, I was again hopeful the super-attentive staff would handle this, but alas, it was the one thing they didnt and wouldnt do. For newborns and solid sleepers, the problem is easily solved: Carefully snip away while your baby snoozes. But once those rascals grow more active and resistant, you can run in to real troubleespecially if, like my fourteen-month-old son, your childs energy level rivals a non-stop, full-blown tornado. 
Out of sheer desperation, and after a decade of parenting, I finally discovered a trick to save us all from looking like something the cat just dragged in. To keep those nails nice and trim, I found a no-fail nail-clipping solution that takes just a few painless minutes.
 Strap your tiny tiger into a baby carrier, facing out, and snip away. Although kids can still wave their arms and legs pretty freely, theres something about the full-body harness that makes any resistance not only futile, but super easy to manage. 
And in my experience using this trick, the kid is distracted enough looking around that for oncefor ONCEthey dont care what youre doing to their fingernails or toenails.","If you struggle to clip your toddler’s nails, you’re not alone.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Several people are dead and thousands of homes and other properties destroyed after wildfires descended on California this week, burning both sides of the state and laying waste to everything in their path. The Woolsey fire has reportedly burned more than 70,000 acres and hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate. The Camp Fire has since been declared the most destructive in Californias history. Several fire whirls were observed at the sprawling sites of the three wildfires, the Camp Fire in the north and the Hill and Woolsey Fires in the southern part of the state. KTLA, a CW affiliate, reported observing a fire devil near the 101 Freeway on Friday. Laura Anthony of ABC-affiliate KGO-TV also shared footage of a fire whirl near Paradise, a community of 27,000 people that was almost entirely wiped out by the Camp Fire. Another video shared on Instagram captured a fire whirl reportedly situated near Malibu. Fire whirls develop in a similar manner to dust devils and are essentially spinning columns of hot air. They are sometimes referred to as fire tornadoesand some of these incidents have been reported as suchbut according to weather scientists, theres a difference. California experienced what the National Weather Service announced was the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado during the Carr Fire in July, an incident that Clements pointed to as an example of a true fire tornado. Arizona State University fire historian Stephen Pyne told Earther at the time that documentation of such phenomena is rare, meaning we know relatively little about how and why they form. Fire whirls, by contrast, are more common. Craig Clements, director of the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San José State University, described them to Earther as basically wind shear that gets tilted up. The three major fires continued to burn as of Saturday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The Camp Fire had reportedly burned 100,000 acres as of Saturday morning and was 20 percent contained. The Hill Fire was 25 percent contained after burning thousands of acres. The Woolsey Fire, however, was still not contained as of Saturday.","Several people are dead and thousands of homes and other properties destroyed after wildfires descended on California this week, burning both sides of the state and laying waste to everything in their path.

Gabriella Borter,"(Reuters) - A pair of tornadoes killed at least 23 people on Sunday in Alabama, causing infrastructure damage with at least 150 miles per hour (241 kph) winds in the deadliest twister to hit the United States in almost six years. 
The following is a list of some of the deadliest single tornadoes and tornado outbreaks in the United States over the last quarter century: 
* A so-called Super Outbreak of 362 tornadoes hit the southeastern United States over three days in April 2011, killing an estimated 321 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Three of the tornadoes were rated EF-5, the top of the five-step Enhanced Fujita scale that meteorologists use to measure tornado strength. The system struck Alabama the hardest, wrecking Tuscaloosa and Birmingham and causing about $11 billion in damages across 12 states. 
* The deadliest tornado to hit the United States in the last several decades struck Joplin, Missouri on May 22, 2011 and killed at least 158 people, NOAA said. Damage from the storm exceeded $3 billion, the most of any single tornado in U.S. history. 
* The so-called Super Tuesday Outbreak of 87 tornadoes in the southeastern United States on Feb. 5, 2008, killed 57 people, according to NOAA. It had the longest footprint of any tornado in U.S. history, according to private forecaster Accuweather, touching down continuously for 122 miles (196 km) through Arkansas. 
* A tornado outbreak in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, metropolitan area on May 3, 1999, spawned 61 tornadoes and killed 55 people, with one single tornado responsible for 36 deaths, according to the Weather Channel. 
* An outbreak of seven tornadoes in central Florida in February 1998 killed 42 people and injured 260 others in the state’s deadliest tornado outbreak since 1962, the National Weather Service reported.

M.B. Pell,"TINKER AIR FORCE BASE, Oklahoma (Reuters) - Here, near the heart of America’s “Tornado Alley,” an Air Force contractor built 398 new homes less than a decade ago, bankrolled as part of the U.S. government’s vow of safe shelter for the men and women who serve. 
Today the collection of cookie-cutter duplexes is showing declines more typical of aged and neglected housing. Last spring, just six years after landlord Balfour Beatty Communities finished construction, the company was forced to start replacing every foot of water line in each house to fix systemic plumbing failures. In September, the company and Air Force inspected the tiny rooms where heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment is housed. Half had mold or water damage. Residents complain of leaks, mold, rodents and cockroaches. 
While living in her new house on base, Stephanie Oakley’s five-year-old son underwent 42 weeks of chemotherapy, 33 days of pelvis radiation and 10 days of full-lung radiation this year. Doctors removed his adenoids, the hospital says, and then his tonsils. 
The cancer treatment severely weakened his immune system. Any infections from mold, the family’s doctor warned, could be lethal. So when Oakley found mold in the vents of her home in August, she instantly called Balfour Beatty. 
Yet the cleanup worsened the problem, she said. A contractor cleaned the vents but failed to cover the Oakleys’ possessions. She returned home to find fungus throughout the house. Green webs of mold stretched across the Batman emblems of her son’s sheets. 
“I never felt hopeless about him getting cancer. I had faith,” she said. “But this right here is harder to deal with.” 
Her story is part of a largely hidden reality about life on America’s military bases. The U.S. Department of Defense has privatized most of the living quarters on bases around the country, partnering with private companies to manage the vast system. What the Pentagon touts as privatization’s signature achievement the building of new housing for military families is marred by faulty construction and poor upkeep, Reuters found. 
The Pentagon has never publicly released a definitive assessment of its two-decade old new construction program covering some 150 bases. But three years ago, the Pentagon’s Inspector General spot-checked housing units at five U.S. military bases, finding 282 deficiencies at 89 homes, including dwellings built or renovated under the privatization program. The problems, including “pervasive” fire hazards, faulty electrical wiring and unmitigated mold growth, were caused by “improper installation, insufficient inspection and inadequate maintenance,” the IG found. 
A Reuters review built from court records, interviews and Defense Department Inspector General documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act found serious construction problems with new or renovated housing on at least 17 bases. The flaws include water damage, improper electrical wiring, missing smoke alarms, and construction errors requiring residents to leave new homes. At six bases, the developer, unable to complete construction, was dismissed from the project. 
The building program, some tenants say, has failed to meet the goal the Pentagon set two decades ago of building adequate homes for “the most dedicated” members of the armed services. 
“The service members risk their lives,” said Andrea DeLack, whose husband, a retired Marine first sergeant, served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They were housed in a new, mold-ridden home on an Air Force base in Mississippi run by another landlord. “And in return, the organization as a whole doesn’t even give back with safe housing for us and our kids.” 
Over the past two decades, the Defense Department has transferred ownership of more than 200,000 homes to private landlords. It also contributed $3.4 billion to help finance the renovation of 52,000 old homes and the construction of 80,000 new ones nationwide. The decaying homes in Oklahoma and Mississippi are among that new housing stock. 
The military says the overall quality of housing has improved under the privatization program, but the Pentagon’s massive financial outlay has come with limited federal oversight and little accountability for the companies that run the gargantuan system. The contracts under which landlords operate, their revenues, inspection records and resident complaints are kept secret or heavily redacted by the Defense Department and the companies. The Pentagon says the details are proprietary. 
In a statement to Reuters, the Air Force said it inspects a sampling of homes annually or when concerns arise, and that it requires private operators to employ third parties to ensure homes meet local building codes. The Air Force did not provide the results of its inspections, but noted, “results of these visits vary.” 
“The Air Force places the health and safety of its members as a top priority,” wrote spokeswoman Laura McAndrews. 
Balfour Beatty declined to discuss conditions at specific homes at the Oklahoma Air Force base. In a statement, the London-based company said most residents are pleased with its work. “We are steadfastly committed to making things right in these homes,” it said. 
BIG BUSINESS, BASE TROUBLES 
Balfour Beatty manages 43,000 housing units at Air Force, Army and Navy bases across the country, making it one of the biggest players in the industry. The company won the Tinker contract in 2008. Overall, the base has 660 homes. 
At Tinker and two other bases, the Air Force contributed $137 million in loans to help finance new and renovated housing. The Defense Department does not reveal how much its partner landlords earn in rent. But Reuters estimates the rental revenue is $10.5 million annually at Tinker and $800 million at all the bases where Balfour Beatty is a housing partner. The figures were calculated using Pentagon data on military housing stipends. Neither the military nor Balfour Beatty challenged these estimates. 
Here in the suburbs south of Oklahoma City, Balfour Beatty built nearly 400 homes between 2008 and 2012. It noticed the leaks as early as 2009, according to a court filing by Balfour Beatty. Last spring, Balfour Beatty started replacing every foot of water line in each house to address extensive water damage. 
While plumbers replaced the piping, Air Force housing personnel and Balfour Beatty employees spent a week in September at each new home inspecting the mechanical closets, which hold heating, ventilation and AC equipment. Half had water damage, including spraying leaks, water pools three inches deep, raw sewage, rotten wood and severe mold, records show. 
At a town hall meeting two weeks later, Balfour Beatty executives downplayed the problems, saying mold and water damage in HVAC areas don’t affect residents. “The good news is the mechanical rooms are isolated from the living areas,” said Steve Curtis, vice president of risk management at Balfour Beatty. 
Tim Toburen, an environmental specialist in mold and water damage, disagrees. Examining photos taken by Reuters and residents, Toburen noted the walls separating the mechanical closets from living spaces appear to be made of drywall a material susceptible to mold growth and providing no barrier to water. The air circulation systems themselves, when not properly sealed, suck up mold spores and distribute them around the house, he said. Inspection records obtained by Reuters show dozens of HVAC systems incorrectly sealed in new homes. 
“Clearly there are big problems here,” Toburen said. 
Asked about those problems, spokeswoman McAndrews said the Air Force “is concerned about the water damage.” The Air Force and landlord will promptly reinspect affected homes and make fixes, she said. Balfour Beatty will now inspect the rooms during routine maintenance checks. 
Repairs were finished in October, homes were re-inspected and families are satisfied with the work, said Balfour Beatty spokeswoman Maureen Omrod. 
The landlord is a unit of Balfour Beatty plc, a publicly traded corporation, which reveals little about the finances of its military housing subsidiaries. The Defense Department deems the project finances confidential and will not disclose figures. 
Balfour Beatty assures investors, however, that housing soldiers, sailors and airmen is lucrative. At the company’s August results call with analysts, CEO Leo Quinn described military housing as a “fantastic business.” 
The complaints about new homes extend beyond Oklahoma and Balfour Beatty. Another big player is Hunt Companies, which owns 50,000 homes on 49 bases and bills itself as the “largest military housing owner in the country.” 
At Mississippi’s Keesler Air Force base, 13 military families are suing Hunt over endemic mold infestations they say sprouted from faulty construction and poor maintenance in their homes, which were among 1,000 built from 2007 to 2010 for $287 million. 
Among the plaintiffs is the DeLack family. Earl DeLack, a retired first sergeant in the Marines, said his home at Keesler the base has a Marine detachment was riddled with mold, sickening his wife, baby and two other young children with allergies, rashes and headaches. DeLack said he alerted the base commanders, inspector general and others, to no avail, finally moving off base in 2016. He retired in July, following deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. 
“It was a bad way to leave the Marine Corps,” said his wife, Andrea. 
Another plaintiff, Ann Yarbrough, an Air Force technical sergeant, showed a reporter black spots spreading across her ceiling in early December. Mold has been a recurring problem since the family moved into the house in 2011, putting her three young children at risk, she said. Later in December, the family was moved out of the house for mold remediation and will be spending Christmas in temporary quarters on base. 
“That’s the crazy thing,” Yarbrough said. “When I was deployed to Afghanistan, I was worried about my family back here, because they were getting sick.” 
In court filings, Texas-based Hunt denied allegations of poor maintenance, mold outbreaks or any harm to tenants. However, an internal memo from a Hunt affiliate to Air Force officials in 2008 shows the company knew its new homes were prone to mold. The company and Air Force confirmed to Reuters this month that 1,000 have needed “moisture remediation” in the past two years including those of DeLack and Yarbrough. 
Air Force spokeswoman McAndrews said some homes have required “extensive repairs,” so the service and Hunt agreed to complete the work in phases. The Air Force is monitoring progress “to ensure project milestones were met,” she said. 
Hunt said it’s committed to addressing the problem. “Hunt Military Communities takes pride in providing the best possible housing for our Service Members and their families,” the company said in a written statement. 
FAMILY TROUBLES 
In Oklahoma, landlord Balfour Beatty faces resident complaints of maintenance nightmares and punitive fees. At Tinker, more than a dozen residents said they believe the company is slow to fix problems, admit obvious water damage or investigate mold. 
In Janna Driver’s home on Night Hawk Court, water regularly seeped from the mechanical closet into the adjacent playroom for her four-year-old twin girls, she said. 
In August 2018, the family called in its ninth request for help in a year. Driver’s husband followed the Balfour Beatty maintenance technician into the mechanical closet and snapped pictures of walls covered with mold from floor to ceiling, along with a puddle of water where the air conditioning unit’s condensation pipes emptied onto the floor. Her account is supported by maintenance records and photos and videos she took of the premises. 
When Driver asked Balfour Beatty maintenance staff about the mold, she said they told her the company had been trying to treat it with bleach for six months. 
During that time, medical records show, the family pediatrician diagnosed both twins with chronic upper respiratory infections a symptom of mold exposure. Driver said she, her eldest son and oldest daughter experienced headaches and nosebleeds. 
In August, Balfour Beatty moved the Drivers into temporary base housing, where water leaked into a light fixture. The family moved to a hotel paid for by Balfour Beatty in September. After two months, they left for a home off base. “I haven’t had one headache since,” Driver said. 
Balfour Beatty continued to collect the family’s monthly housing stipend, however. It charged the Drivers a month’s rent for terminating the lease early. And it billed them $1,171 for unspecified damages. 
The company declined to discuss the specifics of the Drivers’ case with Reuters. It said it has been transparent with the Air Force and residents about the plumbing problems, which it said affected a “select segment” of homes. 
Company executives told residents the water damage was caused by defective plastic water lines installed by a subcontractor. Since last spring, Balfour Beatty has spent $6 million to repair water damage and install water lines, replacing the lines in at least 150 new homes, with plans to finish the remaining 250 by May. 
In October, Balfour Beatty sued NIBCO, the Indiana company that made the water lines, in federal court in Oklahoma, alleging systematic failure of the equipment that caused “extensive leaks” throughout the Tinker homes. Balfour Beatty was still discovering new leaks at Tinker “on a weekly basis,” the suit said. 
Earlier this year, NIBCO agreed to pay $43 million to settle a separate class action suit over allegations its water lines failed in homes across the country. Edward Sullivan, NIBCO’s general counsel, said the company believes other installation problems were to blame at Tinker and plans to fight the Balfour Beatty lawsuit. 
In any case, the original pipes aren’t the only problem with the new homes. Inspection records show leaking HVAC systems and roofs, backed-up sewage lines and standing water in homes where the lines were replaced. Balfour Beatty insisted sewage backups were not a problem, but records show three homes had backups in HVAC rooms, one described as “bad raw sewage.” 
In August and September, senior airman Abigaila Courtney said, sewage water backed up from her shower drain into the nursery in her remodeled home which does not have plastic water lines. An environmental testing firm found high levels of mold spores in her child’s bedroom. Her four-month-old baby boy went to the emergency room with breathing difficulty, according to a letter from her son’s doctor. The doctor told Balfour Beatty to remove mold from their home. 
Balfour Beatty declined to comment on Courtney’s complaints. 
Courtney discovered that Balfour Beatty’s maintenance log, which she shared with Reuters, sometimes did not match the work done at her home. The log said her air filter was replaced in September, but a week after the purported upgrade, the filter was so furry it looked like a bearskin rug, according to a photograph she took at the time. 
In the past, the work order system did not always match “actual performance,” the Air Force’s McAndrews said. After an audit, she said, changes were made to improve the work order process. 
Courtney said the base’s inspector general told her it couldn’t help. So her family moved in with her sister-in-law off base. Nevertheless, Balfour Beatty said it would continue to collect her rent. “We have nothing to back us up and no one to help us,” she said. 
BIG BILL AND SECRECY 
In October, Balfour Beatty gathered Tinker residents in a town hall meeting to try to ease their concerns. A Reuters reporter was in the audience. 
To educate the tenants about mold, company vice president Curtis kicked off his talk by defining the word “ubiquitous.” Mold, he continued, is everywhere. He displayed a picture of mushrooms growing in the yard of his home and discussed the many uses for mold, such as making penicillin, beer and cheese. 
“We eat mold,” he said. “Does anyone like gorgonzola cheese?” 
Stephanie Oakley, whose husband is an Air Force staff sergeant, said she called Balfour Beatty 30 times since moving in three years ago to complain about leaky plumbing, heating and cooling problems and water damage that left her living room carpet so wet it soaked through her socks. She said the carpet smelled like pee. 
Oakley later learned the dank conditions posed an acute health threat for her son, who was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, a soft tissue cancer, in October 2017. 
She began to worry in August when she discovered mold in all six of her vents and a patch growing on her carpet. An environmental testing firm found high levels of mold spores in her son’s bedroom. 
Her son’s oncologist wrote Balfour Beatty Communities that “death rates are unfortunately high” when pediatric cancer patients contract infections from mold and fungus. He urged the company to remove the fungi and mold. 
Balfour Beatty agreed to replace the flooring, clean the vents and pay for the family’s hotel room for a month, Oakley said. But the cleanup backfired. 
Oakley said a Balfour Beatty contractor did clean the vents while the family was away, but failed to cover the furniture and possessions. Oakley came home in September to find a patina of mold spreading across the house and on her shoes, her husband’s dress shirts and their son’s bedding. 
Still, the landlord would not acknowledge the existence of mold, nor would it share the results of its own mold tests with the Oakleys, she said. 
On September 26, Oakley learned her son was officially cancer free. The next step was follow-up chemotherapy to cut the chances of a recurrence. 
That same day, the boy’s doctors discovered a possible infection in his lung, delaying his follow-up chemo for weeks. The spot in his lung turned out to be severe asthma congestion. Though the cause cannot be certain, mold spores can aggravate asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
In the weeks after the company’s town meeting in October, the Oakleys moved into a new home off base. It is mold free. 
After they left, Balfour Beatty accused the family of breaking the lease early and continued to collect $1,314 in monthly rent from the husband’s paycheck. The company also billed the Oakleys $2,400 to replace the mold-coated carpet, blaming the family for its condition. 
The bill came with an offer. Oakley said if the family agreed not to sue and not to publicly discuss their experiences at Tinker housing, Balfour Beatty would waive the fee and refund one month of rent. 
“It’s making us feel like we don’t have an option, like we have to sign it so we can make our mortgage payment,” Oakley said in late November, still mulling the company’s offer. 
In the days after Reuters asked Balfour Beatty about the Oakleys, the Drivers and the Courtneys, the landlord stopped garnishing their monthly housing stipends.","Here, near the heart of America’s “Tornado Alley,” an Air Force contractor built 398 new homes less than a decade ago, bankrolled as part of the U.S. government’s vow of safe shelter for the men and women who serve.",2018-12-21T18:47:01Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Special Report: U.S. military's new housing plagued by construction flaws,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-construction-special-rep-idUSKCN1OK153,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20181221&t=2&i=1337721272&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEEBK0UQ,reuters,Reuters,tornado,1
BeauHD,"A hacker set off the tornado emergency sirens in the middle of the night last week across two North Texas towns. Following the unauthorized intrusion, city authorities had to shut down their emergency warning system a day before major storms and potential tornados were set to hit the area. The false alarm caused quite the panic in the two towns, as locals were already on the edge of their seats regarding incoming storms. The city had run tests of the tornado alarm sirens a week before, but the tests were set during the middle of the day and had long concluded. The two hacked systems were taken offline the next morning, and remained offline ever since.
Bad weather, including storms and potential tornadoes, was announced for all last week in the North Texas area. A severe thunderstorm hit the two cities the following night, on March 13. Thunderstorms are known to produce brief tornadoes, but luck had it that no tornado formed and hit the towns that day. Tornadoes are frequent in Texas, as the state is located in Tornado Alley, and tornado season, a period of the year between March and May when most tornadoes happen, had officially begun. Nevertheless, a tornado didn't form on March 13, and, luckily, the sirens weren't needed.","An anonymous reader quotes a report from ZDNet: A hacker set off the tornado emergency sirens in the middle of the night last week across two North Texas towns.

Rollo Ross,"REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - The “fire tornado” that ripped through Northern California last week forced residents to flee their homes chaotically, many with their pets and little else, people sheltering in Red Cross evacuation centers said. The blaze, the seventh most destructive in California history, roared suddenly into Redding and adjacent communities after being whipped by gale-force winds into a fire storm that jumped the Sacramento River. The erratic blaze forced 38,000 people from their homes. Most of them are staying at hotels or with friends and relatives. But nearly 300 are at Red Cross shelters in the Redding area, including retired firefighter Steven Bailey. Bailey and others at the shelter said the fire’s towering inferno bewildered them. “It’s tough being on the other side. Being on the engine and going in, that was tough but it was a different type of tough when you get told to leave and you don’t know anything, yeah, so it’s different. I don’t wish anyone to have to experience (it).” Rob McDonald said he left his home in Shasta County hoping the fire would not make it up the hill where he lives, taking only a few personal items with him. “Wish I would have grabbed a few other things. I was thinking it wasn’t going to get up there, it was a just ‘in-case’ thing. And it did. And so I’m in limbo, total limbo as to what’s going on up there,” McDonald said. As the fire approached, people grabbed what they could. For many, that included their furry friends. Volunteers set up a special hall at the Shasta College evacuation center to cater for people with pets, not only dogs and cats but also rats, pot-bellied pigs and a giant tortoise. Frank Williams, who managed to bring his dogs but had to leave his pet birds behind, was emotional when recalling how noisy the animals were when they arrived last Friday. “I can tell you about how quiet it was last night, after the animals being stressed from when we got in here on Friday. You could have heard a pin drop, finally, last night because all the animals were dead tired from barking,” Williams said. Wildfire evacuations have become a fact of life in California, which is bearing the brunt of an extreme run of wildfires across the U.S. West. At least 10,000 people have been dislodged in Mendocino County in California’s wine country from two wildfires. Hundreds were evacuated from the Cranston Fire in Riverside County east of Los Angeles last week. Erratic winds and record high temperatures have fueled blazes that blackened nearly 410,000 acres in California, the state’s highest year-to-date level in a decade.

Kevin Jeanes,"(WXYZ) - After a cloudy and rainy day today, we could see stronger storms developing heading into the night. Some storms may have enough rotation to spawn an isolated tornado. However, the biggest storm threat will be damaging wind gusts over 60 mph. We could also see hail over 3/4"" in some thunderstorms. There is still some uncertainty on how the storms will evolve this evening. There's a chance the cloud cover we see through the day keeps the instability low enough tonight where storms do not turn severe. However, the low level jet (south/southeast winds) could become strong enough to create rotation in a few storms, as a cold front draws closer to southeast Michigan overnight. The strengthening wind shear will at least bring the chance of gusty winds, frequent lightning and heavy rain tonight. The overall risk of tornadoes is still low, but there is a slightly higher chance of rotating storms from Ann Arbor to Detroit and to the south; across northern Indiana and Ohio, than areas to the north. TIMING: Strong storms are possible from 7pm to 2am. POTENTIAL IMPACTS: - Damaging wind gusts 60+mph - Weak isolated tornadoes - Hail 3/4"" or greater - Frequent lightning - Heavy rain HOW TO PREPARE: - Keep phones and tablets charged - Unplug electronics that do not have a surge protector - Have a kit with batteries ready in case the power goes out We will keep you updated on Channel 7, on our WXYZ Facebook page, and through our WXYZ app.","WXYZ Damaging winds, isolated tornado possible in storms in metro Detroit tonight WXYZ (WXYZ) - After a cloudy and rainy day today, we could see stronger storms developing heading into the night.

,"At a Glance A possible tornado left behind a path of damage in northeastern Pennsylvania. Wilkes-Barre Township saw multiple buildings collapse and cars overturned during the storm. A few minor injuries have been reported so far. A possible tornado tore through parts of Pennsylvania late Wednesday night, overturning cars, damaging businesses and knocking down trees and power lines. The Wilkes-Barre Township shopping plaza was hit especially hard by the strong storm. Dave Skutnik, the Regional Director of Communications for the Red Cross of Eastern Pennsylvania said that a "" few minor injuries "" have been reported so far. Township police wrote on their Facebook page that there were reports of “multiple collapsed buildings.” They asked drivers to avoid the area to allow emergency personnel access to the shopping plaza. Photos posted on social media show shattered storefronts and major damage to businesses including a Panera Bread restaurant and a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore. Debris lay scattered in parking lots and on streets and sidewalks. Bruno Isles, a Panera employee, told the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader that he was washing dishes in the back of the restaurant at the time. “My manager had us secure the doors,” he said. “We had tables and chairs flying through the windows.” Isles said he suffered a minor scrape on his arm while he helped to get other people in the restaurant to safety.

Colin Dwyer,"It was just after 7:30 p.m., on July 26, that dispatchers heard Jeremy Stoke's mayday call. The fire inspector had been in his pickup heading to evacuate a neighborhood in northwest Redding, Calif., when he was trapped by the blaze himself. Only silence answered the dispatchers' replies. They found Stoke's body the next day. Now, three weeks later, California officials have explained what happened the night Stoke died in the Carr Fire, which was then just days old. And they have identified his unsettling killer: a tornado of flame, the likes of which the state had never seen before. The behemoth that fire officials describe almost beggars the imagination — but they have video proof, from multiple angles. The footage below was shot from a helicopter. The videos were included in a report released earlier this week by California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. In the report, officials describe a ""large fire tornado"" that had formed on the strength of suddenly gusting winds. It had a base wider than three football fields end to end, according to the report, and winds that whipped as fast as 165 mph. Measured on the standard Enhanced Fujita scale, it had the strength of an EF3 tornado. According to National Weather Service data, few tornadoes in California history are known to have reached that high on the scale — and among those that did, none came close to the sheer width of what Cal Fire says ravaged Northern California. That's not to mention the heat: Inside the cyclone of fire, authorities believe temperatures surpassed 2,700 degrees F — in other words, hotter than volcanic magma. Video recorded from the dash of an emergency vehicle reveals the blinding orange phenomenon consuming the horizon. ""Regardless of the primary factors that caused the fire tornado, the resultant fire behavior was unpredictable and unusual,"" the report said. ""It surprised many highly experienced firefighters."" That includes firefighter Jeremy Stoke, 37, a longtime veteran of the fire service who reportedly cut his vacation short to volunteer for the efforts fighting the Carr Fire. ""It's not something that I have ever received training to look out for. It could've been any of us,"" Redding Fire Marshal Craig Wittner told local media. ""It was something out of this world, a perfect storm,"" Stoke's stepfather, Gary Parmely, told The Associated Press. ""It was incompatible with life, and he happened to drive into it."" Elsewhere that night, the Carr Fire claimed the life of another firefighter, a bulldozer operator who was caught in the blaze's rapid escalation. To date eight people have died in the wildfire or complications related to it, according to member station KQED. And it continues to burn. The Carr Fire has consumed more than 218,000 acres, making it the eighth-largest fire in state history — for now. With the blaze just 75 percent contained, it is likely to claim a higher position in the state's record books before long. As NPR's Camila Domonoske pointed out, four of the largest fires have occurred in the past six years, an accelerating pace that experts link with climate change. The state's largest-ever wildfire, the Mendocino Complex Fire, continues to burn in its own right. At more than 375,000 acres, the blaze has ravaged an area larger than Los Angeles — and its largest branch stands roughly 25 percent from full containment.","California authorities say the behemoth killed a firefighter battling the Carr Fire last month.

Jon Evans,"Let me begin by saying that Facebook’s Crisis Response pages do a lot of good. They are a locus for donations and offers of help. But that said, for the love of humanity, when something bad happens, please stop marking yourself safe on Facebook.
They don’t mean to prey on our anxieties. They mean to assuage them. But all they do is reinforce the incorrect notion that the world is a terrifying place where unpredictable awful things happen frequently; they worsen the problem by attempting to treat the symptom.
Consider, for instance, “The Tornado in Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec, Canada” a few months ago. As a former Ottawa resident I have multiple Facebook friends there. Todd and Jennifer marked themselves safe; but what about Joe? Stefan? Stephane? What happened to them?
Yeah, they’re fine, thanks, because that region has a population of 1.3 million, and while it is a shame that six of them were hospitalized as a result of that tornado (which hit Canada frequently) when you do the math you quickly realize that that is equal to one out of every 216,000 people. If a single person were hospitalized as a result of an incident in a single town of 216,000, would Facebook call on every resident of that town to mark themselves safe?
I mean, if Facebook did do that, why, your feed would be a nonstop deluge of Crises from which people are Marked Safe. The world would seem like a cauldron of terrors, and any unknown much too scary to venture into, full of things which might harm you and your friends and family. You would be fearful of other places, and maybe eventually, almost logically, by extension, people from other places, too.
Our brains are well known to weigh our fears based in part on how vivid they are rather than how likely they are. So we worry more about vivid events than actually fearsome ones. Would Facebook call on New Yorkers to mark themselves safe if a terrorist attack killed 15 people in a busy subway station? Of course they would. It’s not even a question, is it.
But 15 is fewer than the number of New Yorkers killed in traffic every single month. Is Facebook calling on New Yorkers to mark themselves as “Safe From Cars” every month? Of course not. That’s a laughable concept. But the risk of that is greater than the risk of any given New Yorker being killed in that hypothetical terror attack.
And – here’s the key – when Facebook asks you to mark yourself safe, and reports that you’re safe to all your Facebook friends, it may reduce some specific anxiety in the short term, but it does so at the cost of increasing generalized anxiety — about the world and everything in it — in the long term.
There are of course some crises so awful, so huge, so widespread, that this no longer applies; where the risk to any individual is in fact much higher than, say, the annual risk of dying in a car crash. If Facebook reduced its calls to mark yourself safe to such actual crises, then none of the above would apply. Let’s hope that one day they ratchet down their anxiety-inducing algorithms and do just that.","Let me begin by saying that Facebook’s Crisis Response pages do a lot of good.

Alex Dobuzinskis,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California fire captain Robert Veverka and his crew arrived in Redding, California, last Thursday night as gale-force winds whipped the Carr Fire into a flaming tornado. They spent the next 30 hours trying to save homes from the flames. Veverka and his team from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention (Cal Fire) had just come from another wildfire, using part of their 24-hour break between shifts to travel to Redding. That is becoming the new normal for firefighters, said Veverka, “Right now, it’s pretty much guaranteed we’ll go from fire to fire to fire, until everything is out,” the 34-year-old Veverka said in a phone interview. “Once you hit the three- or four-week mark, you’re just constantly exhausted.” The Carr Fire in Northern California, the largest and most destructive of 16 major blazes in the state, is exhausting firefighting resources in what authorities are calling one of the worst and earliest fire seasons in years. Severe, year-round fires have been trending the past decade across the U.S. West, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. California in particular has experienced its worst start to the fire season in a decade, in terms of acreage burned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Driving the wildfires are exceptional drought conditions in large areas of Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, along with abnormally high temperatures. Nearly all of California faces abnormally dry or drought conditions, according to the Drought Monitor agency. “We are concerned about firefighter fatigue and making sure that our firefighters remain focused and try to get a break when they can,” said Cal Fire Assistant Deputy Director Daniel Berlant. “The peak of fire season is ahead of us and we still have many more months to go in this calendar year,” Berlant said. PRISON FIREFIGHTERS Veverka overseas one of Cal Fire’s team of prison inmates who are placed on the fire line, in exchange for about $25 a day and a reduction of their sentences. In the “off-season,” he exercises every day to prepare for the demanding summer firefights. Some prison inmates are not as fit, and about five times a summer, a helicopter has to airlift prisoners suffering from heat exhaustion, he said. Crews typically work a 24-hour shift followed by a 24-hour rest period typically in a motel, Cal Fire officials said. After crews spend 14 days on alternating work and rest periods, authorities try to give them a two-day break, Berlant said. But sometimes crews must wait three weeks for their two-day break, he said. Veverka, from Alturas, California, and his crew have at times gone 40 or 50 days before receiving a two-day break, he said. Berlant acknowledged Cal Fire crews sometimes received such long assignments, but said it was rare. The Carr Fire, which has killed four civilians and two firefighters, has been particularly demanding for firefighters. The long shift Veverka and his crew worked when they arrived was typical of what other crews worked that day, according to the local fire chief. Shasta County Fire Chief Mike Hebrard told a news conference on Sunday that some were working 48 hours straight. “They were just going on pure adrenaline.” DECEMBER FIRE Veverka was activated to wildfire duty on July 1. In a typical year, his deployment winds down by the end of October. But California fire officials have repeatedly warned the fire season is getting longer and more intense. The Thomas Fire erupted in December in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and became the largest in state history. Higher temperatures have helped extend the period of wildfires by 60 to 80 days each year, National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Jennifer Jones said. The U.S. Forest Service has a different work shift structure from Cal Fire. Forest Service crews typically work 16-hour shifts, followed by eight hours of rest, with two days of rest after 14 days on assignment, officials said. Research has shown that, over time, it can take a long-term toll on the bodies of the men and women protecting homes, businesses and natural landmarks. “Over time, the body is not able to respond as well, and one of the things we typically see is firefighters get sick,” Joseph Domitrovich, exercise physiologist with the Forest Service, said in a phone interview. “It’s where their immune system, with repeated activity or fire work stress, they tend to get what we call ‘camp crud,’ which is an upper respiratory tract infection.” Physical exhaustion has also been blamed for a number of safety mishaps that have killed firefighters. For instance, four firefighters died in 2001 when they were caught in the Thirtymile Fire in Washington state. The U.S. Forest Service, in a report, said fatigue was a factor in the poor decision-making that led up to the deaths. The night before their deaths, the firefighters had only slept for one to three hours while traveling to the fire, the report said.

Kelly McLaughlin,"When a tornado ripped through Lee County, Alabama, on Sunday and killed at least 23 people, filmmaker Scott Fillmer took shelter in his home's laundry room with his wife and pets. 
 ""I could literally hear the tornado coming, sounded like a freight train,"" Fillmer told INSIDER, adding that he got a warning sent to his phone five minutes before it hit. 
 Fillmer posted a series of videos to Twitter showing damage to Lee County, particularly the community of Beauregard, which is about 10 miles southeast of the college town of Auburn, and 60 miles east of Montgomery. 
 He found trees and power lines downed, his roof on his front lawn, and mattresses in his driveway. 
 ""We were cutting trees away until it got dark trying get to people's houses down the road to check on people and to try to clear a path for first responders to get in,"" he told INSIDER. Now, he says, his road is like a ""ghost town"" because many neighbors have left. 
 The tornado traveled down a county road in Beauregard, leaving a mile-long trail of destruction, according to the Associated Press. 
 It is believed that the tornado had winds of around 160 mph or higher.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A succession of tornadoes ripped through Alabama’s Lee County on Sunday with winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph), killing at least 23 people including children in the deadliest such storms to strike the United States in almost six years. 
WHAT IS A TORNADO? 
Tornadoes, described as a violently rotating column of air touching the ground, are nature’s most violent storms, capable of killing people and wiping out neighborhoods in a matter of seconds, according to the U.S. National Weather Service. 
Tornadoes occur when dry cold air moving south from Canada meets warm moist air traveling north from the Gulf of Mexico, according to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. 
They can strike with little warning, developing and dissipating quickly, the weather service said. Most tornadoes are on the ground for less than 15 minutes. here
CAN TORNADOES BE PREDICTED? 
Meteorologists at the weather service’s Storm Prediction Center can forecast general conditions that are favorable for tornadoes and will issue a severe thunderstorm or tornado watch that lasts four to six hours. 
But a tornado warning is not issued until a tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar, the prediction center says. here
WHERE AND WHEN DO TORNADOES FORM? 
Most tornadoes are found in the Great Plains of the central United States, also known as Tornado Alley, according to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. 
Tornadoes can form at any time of year, but most occur in the spring and summer months along with thunderstorms. May and June are usually the peak months for tornadoes. here
DO TORNADOES OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES? 
Tornadoes occur most frequently in the United States, where there is an average of more than 1,000 recorded each year, and Canada is a distant second with around 100 per year, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. 
But tornadoes can occur anywhere and have been documented on every continent except Antarctica and in all 50 states. here
HOW ARE TORNADOES MEASURED? 
The National Weather Service measures tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale ranging from 0 to 5. At the low end, an EF rating of 0 measures three-second gusts of wind from 65 to 85 mph (105 to 138 kph). At the high end, an EF rating of 5 measures gusts over 200 mph (322 kph). The Alabama tornadoes reached 150 mph (241 kph) for an EF rating of 3. www.weather.gov/oun/efscale
DOES CLIMATE CHANGE MAKE TORNADOES MORE DEADLY? 
Warmer oceans can create the conditions for more tornadoes, climate scientist Kevin Trenberth told Scientific American, and may have be responsible an increase in tornado damage. here
But the link between tornadoes and climate change is unclear, according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. 
U.S. tornado records only date back to 1950, and much of Tornado Ally was so sparsely populated before then that tornadoes may have occurred without anyone seeing them. Improved technology enables scientists to detect tornadoes now that may not have been noticed decades ago. here

"Mikaela Porter, Matthew Ormseth","The National Weather Service has issued brief tornado warnings for Hartford, Litchfield, Fairfield and New Haven counties, predicting a “dangerous storm” will sweep from west to east across much of the state Tuesday evening. Bradley International Airport briefly suspended flight operations after evacuating its Air Traffic Control Tower at around 4:30 p.m. But around 5 p.m. the airport reopened the tower with the intention of resuming flight operations Tuesday evening. The NWS has also placed Tolland and Windham counties on tornado watch through 9 p.m. As the storm moved west, social media began percolating with images of tenebrous storm clouds, golf ball-sized hail and weather service warnings to shelter in place — but few public officials had received reports of storm damage. Eversource reported more than 6,000 outages by 4 p.m., most of them in Winsted and Torrington. The NWS issues tornado warnings when its radar systems detect rotation or flying debris, or a trained spotter reports a funnel cloud. The NWS issues a warning when a tornado is occurring or about to occur. When the NWS issues a tornado watch, it simply means the conditions for a tornado exist in a region. The NWS has also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for a swath of Hartford County stretching from Collinsville to West Hartford. The NWS predicts heavy rain, thunder and strong winds will whip across northern Connecticut Tuesday evening. Hail as big as golf balls was falling in Falls Village a little before 4 p.m. In Burlington, though no downed lines or trees had been reported as of 5 p.m., a torrential rain was drenching the small west Hartford County town. “The skies are biblical,” policeman Thomas Null said. “Absolutely pouring.” Strong winds blew down trees limbs and power lines in the area of North Canaan and Norfolk Tuesday afternoon, and students in the six-town Region One district were held at their schools while their bus trips home were delayed until the tornado warning was over, said state Rep. Brian Ohler, R-Canaan, a fire fighter in North Canaan. The buses were still parked at the schools as he talked about 4 p.m. in a phone interview. He said no tornado had been observed – just “very strong winds” – and he knew of no injuries or significant damage to buildings. Heavy wind, rain and hail moved through northwest Connecticutat around 4:30 p.m., and first responders were bracing for round two as another line of storms approached, said Jonathan Barbagallo, a spokesman for the Norfolk fire department. The storm took down some trees and caused minor road flooding. “At its height it was impressive,” Barbagallo said. “Strong winds, heavy hail, dime to quarter size hail and visibility was zero.” Firefighters were responding to a report of tree down, but had to turn around and return to headquarters because visibility was so poor and conditions were so dangerous, he said. Litchfield and Bantam firefighters responded to a tree that had fallen on a Litchfield house, reportedly trapping five people inside. The weather service said a tornado watch means that “conditions are favorable for tornadoes.” “We’re looking at the potential and likelihood of torrential downpours, gusty winds, some hail,”said Gary Lessor, chief meteorologist at the Western Connecticut State University’s Weather Center. “Some of the winds could gust over 55 miles per hour.” Lessor said the rain would be “quick moving” and will move “briskly” across the state but not all in the state will see damaging winds and hail. He said severe conditions are likely in the northern parts of Fairfield and New Have counties as well as all of Litchfield county and Hartford counties. Severe thunderstorms are possible between 3 and 9 p.m., according to The National Weather Service out of Boston, which has issued a hazardous weather outlook for the northern part of the state, warning of damaging winds, isolated hail and heavy rain. It also warned of a “low risk” of an isolated tornado across western and central Massachusetts and northern Connecticut. Lessor said there’s a few towns in New England, as well as New York and Pennsylvania that could see a tornado this afternoon.

ANDY KOPSA,"As I watched shaky cellphone videos, I started to cry. What would happen to the Orpheum theater, where my father took me and my brother to movies, or grandmas house, where we would stop after church on Sundays?
The day after my father died, my husband and I made a trip to Marshalltown for groceries. We decided to take a drive around and survey the tornado damage. It was incredible. I threw myself into our disaster tour, enjoying the destruction of other peoples things, greedily searching out the worst-hit blocks, the most destroyed buildings I needed it all.
We turned onto Main Street to head back home, and I was talking fast to my husband in the passenger seat. I got louder; I was yelling now, driving, crying. I abruptly pulled over to the side of the road, alongside the destroyed courthouse, and I screamed and I screamed and I screamed. And then I stopped. Heaving, I accepted the Kleenex my husband silently handed me, I blew my nose, and we drove in contented silence the 18 miles home.
My fathers last day on earth was a rough one. I am convinced he overheard us talking about possibly taking him into the hospice. We couldnt keep up the relentless pace his care required, even though we knew he wanted to stay home. I hated the idea, but we had to consider it. My mother thought so, too.
Then, my father spiraled quickly. One sister feverishly moved her flight up from London she would be home the next day, she told my father on the phone, his face lighting up listening to her voice. My other sister, from Minneapolis, was on her way but was trapped sheltering under an overpass as tornado warnings swirled around Interstate 35.
I started a journal after my father was diagnosed. I wrote: I just want him to feel good with the time he has left, I want him to find peace and acceptance. All I want is for him to not be scared.","When my father died, I wanted desperately to know the timing of this thing.

MELISSA GOMEZ,"Elliot Fineman, chief executive of the National Gun Victims Action Council, said the response to the Parkland shooting by arming teachers is flawed. “The way to stop the school shootings is to have sane gun laws like other developed countries,” he said. Arming teachers is a defensive measure, Mr. Fineman said, but preventive measures need to be taken. On Feb. 14, the day Nikolas Cruz killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., Rick Noble, the retired police officer in Farmer City, Ill., made up his mind to help his community. As owner of Adventure Tactical Training, which specializes in concealed-carry weapons training, he wanted to make sure local educators are prepared. On Sunday afternoon, with a tornado warning in effect, he guided his trainees in groups of eight out from his garage to have them practice at a shooting range in a steady downpour. “They all really want this training,” Mr. Noble, 57, said. He estimates that he received 75 to 100 requests after he advertised the free training the night of the Parkland shooting, but had to keep it to just 50. In addition to conducting training events, Mr. Noble has presented the “Student Safety and Protection” document to seven school boards. “We just want to be a step ahead of the resolution,” he said. “Unless we get some quality trained people in there,” he added, “we’re not going to be able to stop it.”","Teachers and school staff members practiced shooting at Adventure Tactical Training in Farmer City, Ill., on Sunday in hopes of being certified for concealed-carry gun licenses.",2018-06-12T09:00:15Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Illinois Prohibits Guns on Campuses.

Cynthia Fodor,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Iowans in three communities are starting to clean up after several tornadoes tore through central Iowa Thursday. Among dozens of homes and several businesses that were damaged, miraculously there were no lives lost and there are no reports of serious injuries. Gov. Kim Reynolds and Lt. Gov. Adam Gregg, along with Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management Acting Director Joyce Flinn, will tour areas impacted by severe storms and tornadoes on Friday. National Weather Service experts will also be assessing tornado damage. They confirm 27 tornadoes were reported in Iowa Thursday, and 5 are confirmed to have touched down. MARSHALLTOWN Sky8 video shows Marshalltown tornado damage from the air Marshalltown appeared to have been hit the hardest. Brick walls collapsed in the streets and roofs were blown off buildings. The only hospital in Marshalltown was damaged and patients were being transferred. Thousands of people are still without power after tornadoes that struck Marshalltown and other Iowa communities. On Friday Alliant Energy was working to restore electricity to nearly 6,400 customers in the Marshalltown area, which appeared to have been hit the hardest Thursday afternoon. The Marshall County Courthouse, several businesses and dozens of homes damaged, but few injuries and no deaths have been reported. The Red Cross has set up an emergency shelter for those impacted by the tornado that hit Marshalltown. It is located at the Meskwaki Conference Center at the Meskwaki Hotel/Casino in Tama. Anyone displaced can stay at the shelter. The tornado hit Marshalltown just as clothing shop owner Stephanie Moz, her husband and their 2-month-old baby were taking a late lunch break. She says the storm broke out the shop's window, ruined the clothing and hats they had on display and destroyed her husband's vehicle, but she's relieved. She says, ""We went through a tornado and survived. I'm happy."" Moz says she heard a storm siren and her mother texted her to seek shelter, so she and her 2-month-old son, Fredy Jr., rushed to the basement. Her husband looked outside and then ran back, shouting ""Get in the basement. It's right over us."" They could hear booms and crashes, and a gust of wind blew through the basement, but they emerged safely. Moz says, ""We're OK. Not a scratch."" The baby? He barely noticed. Moz says, ""It didn't really bother him. He wanted to sleep."" The damage from the Thursday afternoon tornado severely damaged many of the buildings in the city of 27,000, about 50 miles northeast of Des Moines. There were no reports of deaths from the tornado that slammed into the city, but the brick buildings that surround the 132-year-old courthouse were severely damaged. The city's wide streets were littered with bricks and downed trees. The courthouse also was hit hard, as the tornado caused its cupola to tumble about 175 feet to the ground. A spokeswoman for UnityPoint Health says that 40 patients are being evacuated from its hospital damaged by a tornado. UnityPoint Health spokeswoman Amy Varcoe, who is based in Des Moines, says it was unclear how severely the UnityPoint hospital in Marshalltown was damaged, but all of its patients are being transferred to the health system's hospitals in Waterloo and Grundy Center. Marshalltown officials provide damage update Lennox Industries’ manufacturing facility in Marshalltown sustained tornado damage. There were no reported injuries to on-site employees. The extent of damage to the facility is currently being assessed. Some buildings at the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown sustained roof damage when the tornado hit Thursday. Commandant Timon Oujiri says the facility housing nearly 500 residents lost power, but that no residents or staffers were injured. He says generators are now powering the buildings. Alliant Energy says more than 5,800 customers remain without power in Marshalltown, and that natural gas service has been shut down in part of the city. Crews have been dispatched to repair damage and assess which areas can have gas service safely restored. Police ask that you not drive to Marshalltown to view the damage. A curfew was set in place Thursday night at 9 p.m. There are still downed power lines and dangerous debris in streets in Marshalltown. PELLA Seven people inside a Pella manufacturing plant when it was struck by a tornado have been treated for injuries at the local hospital and released. Pella Regional Health Center spokeswoman Billie Rhamy confirmed Thursday evening injuries were minor and all patients had been discharged. Vermeer Manufacturing, which has about 2,800 employees manufacturing industrial and agricultural equipment, was hit by a tornado around 4 p.m. Vice President of Operations Vince Newendorp says the east half of the company's campus, which includes seven manufacturing buildings, sustained extensive damage. He says the plant activated its storm warning system, and workers were in shelters when the storm hit. The company makes agricultural machinery including hay balers and mowers and equipment for the pipeline and forestry management industries. BONDURANT The storm struck Bondurant first, but did perhaps the least amount of damage there. An official says four or five homes are destroyed on the northeast edge of the city of Bondurant. Fire Chief Aaron Kreuder says several other homes in the city just northeast of Des Moines have significant damage but appear to be repairable. A collapsed wall in one of the damaged homes ruptured, causing a major gas leak for more than an hour until a hole could be dug in the yard to shut off the line. Kreuder says a tornado dropped to the ground, rose back up and then dropped again. He said minor injuries were reported but nothing requiring emergency transportation to the hospital. ""The Polk County Sheriff’s Office will be opening the roadblocks in Bondurant shortly. There will be intermittent traffic control for emergency and clean up vehicles. We are still asking that, if you don’t live in Bondurant, please avoid the area during the clean up. There will continue to be an increased PCSO presence during this time.""

Associated Press,"CLEARLAKE, Calif. – The Latest on California wildfires (all times local): 4:15 p.m. Authorities are ordering residents along a Northern California lake to evacuate homes in the path of a growing wildfire amid concerns that hot, windy and dry weather conditions will persist throughout the weekend. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokeswoman Jane LaBoa says a wildfire remains several miles from the communities along the eastern shore of Clear Lake, about 110 miles (175 kilometers) north of San Francisco. But LaBoa says its trajectory and the weather forecast prompted officials to evacuate the communities Friday out of an abundance of caution. The wildfire has grown to 175 square miles (280 square kilometers) and is a few miles from connecting with a second blaze that has grown to 64 square miles (105 square kilometers). The twin fires have destroyed 41 homes. ___ 11:50 a.m. A California bulldozer operator nearly slipped off a steep mountain trail three times before his vehicle finally rolled into a ravine and fatally crushed him. A Department of Forestry and Fire Protection preliminary report says each earlier slip alone qualified as a ""near miss"" warning that the century-old mining trail could collapse. The report says 36-year-old Braden Varney was working alone overnight July 14 fighting a wildfire sparked hours earlier outside Yosemite National Park. His assistant had gone to get a new hydraulic hose. Varney's radio wasn't communicating with headquarters, so his assistant relayed messages — until they lost contact. Varney was a 10-year veteran. The report says his death highlights the need for better risk assessment, communication and supervision. Varney became the first of four California firefighters to die this year. ___ 11:15 a.m. Experts say a deadly Northern California wildfire burned so hot at its peak that it created a cyclone of flames that reached 143 mph, ripping through the region with the force of a destructive Midwest tornado. National Weather Service meteorologist Duane Dykema said Friday that the blaze still burning near Redding created a fire whirl that uprooted trees and tore roofs from homes. Dykema says the whirl started when hot air from the exceptionally hot fire rose and twisted tightly, creating a powerful tornado of flames and wind. He says fire whirls are common, but not at the intensity recorded on July 26. The fire burning near Redding has grown to 206 square miles (533 square kilometers) and destroyed at least 1,060 homes. ___ 7:40 a.m. Increasing winds are expected in Northern California areas where deadly and destructive wildfires are burning. The National Weather Service has issued warnings for critical fire weather conditions Friday and Saturday as a series of dry low-pressure systems pass through the region, bringing gusts up to 35 mph (56 kph) in the afternoon. Forecasters say highest threat areas include a fire near the city of Redding and the Mendocino Complex of two fires north of San Francisco. The forecast includes extremely low humidity levels that leave vegetation ready to burn. The 206-square-mile (533-square-kilometer) Carr Fire 100 miles south of the Oregon border is 39 percent contained after destroying 1,060 homes and many other structures. Two firefighters have died there. New evacuations were ordered late Thursday at the Mendocino Complex.","Fox News The Latest: Growing California fires prompt new evacuations Fox News CLEARLAKE, Calif. – The Latest on California wildfires (all times local):. 4:15 p.m..

Samuel Chamberlain,"Multiple tornadoes tore through central Iowa on Thursday night, taking forecasters by surprise and causing damage in several towns. Injuries were reported after a tornado slammed into an agricultural machinery plant in Pella, about 40 miles southeast of Des Moines. Liz Sporrer, a spokeswoman for manufacturer Vermeer Corp., told The Des Moines Register that the facility sustained extensive damage. ""We’re carefully walking through, making sure everyone is getting taken care of,"" Sporrer said. ""Our No. 1 priority is to get team members safely home."" She added that the business was hosting visitors for a special event when the tornado struck. Pella Police Lt. Shane Cox told television station KCCI-TV that some people from the plant were taken to a hospital, but he didn't know the extent of their injuries or the number of people. Emergency responders were attempting to get inside the damaged building to see if anyone was trapped. One of the factory's several manufacturing buildings sustained extensive damage, with metal strewn across the parking lot and across the street into a cornfield. Vehicles were overturned and piled onto others. In Marshalltown, northeast of the state capital, several buildings and a historic courthouse were damaged. A woman working at Hammer Medical Supply downtown told The Associated Press that her building suffered damage, as did The Orpheum, a theater built in 1948. Amy Varcoe, a spokeswoman for Des Moines-based UnityPoint Health, told AP that its hospital in Marshalltown was being evacuated and 40 patients were being moved to hospitals in Waterloo and Grundy Center. It was not clear how severely the building was damaged. Additional funnels were reported as the storm moved east of Des Moines past Altoona, Prairie City and Colfax. Alex Krull, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Des Moines, said that forecasting models produced Thursday morning showed only a slight chance of strong thunderstorms later in the day. ""This morning, it didn't look like tornadic supercells were possible,"" Krull said. ""If anything, we were expecting we could get some large hail, if strong storms developed."" Krull said the weather service expected a severe weather threat to remain in effect through 7-8 p.m. local time as the storms moved east and north.

Madeline Farber,"Severe thunderstorms ravaged across the southeast earlier this week, resulting in at least one confirmed tornado at Jacksonville State University in Alabama. Now, parts Florida and coastal communities in Georgia and the Carolinas are at risk for severe weather, which may include tornadoes. Read on for a look at why tornadoes occur and what to do if you’re caught in one. What is a tornado? Essentially, a tornado is a column of air that is rapidly rotating. The column typically forms from a thunderstorm, stretching down and eventually reaching the ground below. When this happens, the column takes the shape of a funnel -- also known as a funnel cloud, according to the Ready Campaign, a national public service campaign that helps Americans respond to natural and manmade disasters, among other things. When do tornadoes typically occur? ""Peak tornado"" season hits the South in March and ends around May, the Virginia Department of Transportation says on its website. The severe weather pattern usually makes its way north, with the majority of tornadoes hitting northern states over the summer. “Half of tornadoes typically happen in May and June,” Harold Brooks, senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Severe Storms Laboratory, told AccuWeather in April 2017. However, tornadoes tend to hit the Gulf coast earlier during the spring, NOAA explains on its website. ""But, remember, tornadoes can happen at any time of year. Tornadoes can also happen at any time of day or night, but most tornadoes occur between 4 to 9 p.m.,"" NOAA adds. Why do tornadoes occur and how do they form? Most tornadoes form from supercells, also known as a rotating thunderstorm or a mesocyclone. A supercell is typically a thunderstorm with the “winds already in motion,” according to National Geographic. It requires a combination of warm, moist air and cold, dry air -- which are the “ingredients for a regular thunderstorm,"" Brooks told the publication. To put it simply, warm, moist air near the earth’s surface begins to rise, blowing in one direction at one speed. Subsequently, the cold air above is blowing in a different direction at a different speed. This creates a wind shear, which causes the air to rotate in a column. From here, if the air column gets caught in the updraft of a supercell, it causes the air to spin faster and create a funnel shape. The funnel of air becomes a tornado as it extends toward the earth and reaches the ground below. It’s worth noting, however, that supercells are relatively rare. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), supercells are the least common type of thunderstorm.” Roughly one in a thousand storms become supercells. From there, only one in about six of those supercells will become a tornado, National Geographic reports. But if they do form, “they have a high propensity to produce severe weather, including damaging winds, very large hail, and sometimes weak to violent tornadoes,” according to the NWS. Where do tornadoes typically hit? While tornadoes can form almost anywhere given the right conditions, they commonly touch down in Florida and an area of the U.S. called “tornado alley.” Tornado alley, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), is a “nickname given to an area in the southern plains of the central United States that consistently experiences a high frequency of tornadoes each year.” Tornado alley includes parts of central Texas, then moving into Great Plains states such as Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Parts of Iowa, Missouri and eastern Colorado are also considered part of tornado alley. What can you do to protect yourself during a tornado? The intensity of a tornado is measured using the Fujita scale, which ranges from an F0 to an F5. The latter is the most destructive and dangerous type of tornado. The winds from an F5 tornado can reach over 200 miles an hour. To protect yourself from a tornado, it’s important to know the difference between a tornado watch and a tornado warning: a watch indicates a tornado could form, while a warning means a tornado has already been spotted, according to the Ready Campaign. Some homes in Tornado-alley are equipped with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-approved “safe rooms,” which, according to the organization, is a “hardened structure specifically designed to meet FEMA criteria and provide life-safety protection in extreme wind events, including tornadoes and hurricanes.” However, if you are not able to reach a safe room during a tornado, it’s best to go to the lowest level of a structure, such as a basement. It is important to stay away from all windows, doors or anything else that leads outside, the Ready Campaign recommends. Wearing a helmet and placing blankets, pillows or even a mattress over your body may protect you from debris if a tornado hits your home or a nearby building. If you do not have a basement, the Ready Campaign also suggests hiding in a closet. (To find out what else you should do before, during and after a tornado, you can read more here ).

Tornadoes are more likely to pop up around the spring and fall, ""when warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico pushes into a colder air mass from Canada,"" Dean explained. ""Large thunderstorms often form when these air masses collide and a whirling, rotating funnel-shaped column of air can form inside these storms and then connect with the ground."" Why do tornadoes occur and how do they form? A man stands atop a smashed car in a tornado-ravaged neighborhood south of Oklahoma City. The F5 tornado killed some 44 people in May 1999.

Tornadoes are also unpredictable. While tornadoes are ""spawned by strong thunderstorms, not all strong thunderstorms end up predicting tornadoes,"" Dean said. Weather forecasters can't predict which storms will produce tornadoes with 100 percent certainty, but they ""can forecast where supercell thunderstorms are likely to develop,"" Dean explained.

The winds from an EF-5 tornado can reach over 200 miles an hour. “The strongest ones can destroy large buildings, lift trees, and toss cars and trucks around like toys,” Dean said, adding that the average number of tornadoes reported across the U.S. has per year is about 1,200. To protect yourself from a tornado, it’s important to know the difference between a tornado watch and a tornado warning: a watch indicates a tornado could form, or “there are weather conditions that are favorable for tornadoes,” Dean said. A warning means a tornado has already been spotted. “The strongest ones can destroy large buildings, lift trees, and toss cars and trucks around like toys."" - Janice Dean It’s important to have an emergency plan before a tornado. This means having enough food and water to last at least three days and to make sure everyone knows where to go before the tornado hits. Some homes in Tornado-alley are equipped with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-approved “safe rooms,” which, according to the organization, is a “hardened structure specifically designed to meet FEMA criteria and provide life-safety protection in extreme wind events, including tornadoes and hurricanes.” However, if you are not able to reach a safe room during a tornado, it’s best to go to the lowest level of a structure, such as a basement. It is important to stay away from all windows, doors or anything else that leads outside, the Ready Campaign recommends. Wearing a helmet and placing blankets, pillows or even a mattress over your body may protect you from debris if a tornado hits your home or a nearby building. If you do not have a basement, Dean also suggests hiding in a closet or bathroom on the ground level. “If you can, get under a sturdy piece of furniture, like a table,” she advised, adding that mobile-home owners should seek alternate shelter because they offer little protection. “Get out of automobiles. Do not try to outrun a tornado in your car, leave it immediately. If you’re outside, go to a ditch or low-lying area and lie flat in it,” Dean said. “Stay away from fallen power lines and stay out of damaged areas.” After a tornado is over, stay indoors until it is safe to come out. ""Check for injured or trapped people without putting yourself in danger,” Dean said. Be on the lookout for any downed power lines and use flashlight to inspect your home, Dean added.

Samuel Axon,"reader comments 0 LOS ANGELES— Just Cause 4 has the opportunity to take a video game franchise that has never quite hit its stride into the spotlight. 2015's Just Cause 3 was the franchise's best game yet, and though it had some major flaws, the basic ingredients were so fun, players could be forgiven for thinking just one more iteration would lead to ""classic"" status. Just Cause 3 's flaws were very notable indeed, especially on the PC. Performance and network issues severely hurt the experience on that platform when the game first launched. Low framerates (20 to 30 frames per second in high-intensity moments) were the game's Achilles' heel on the PS4 and Xbox One. I played it on PS4, and for me at least, the sandbox mayhem and core gameplay loop were just too fun to get hung up on the framerate. Besides, it wasn't a game about precision; it was a game about seeing your hilariously ridiculous hair-brained schemes come to fruition in unexpected ways. It was part Grand Theft Auto, sure, but it was also part Garry's Mod or Kerbal Space Program. I was more bothered by the fact that the game's open world wasn't that deep, and it felt repetitive pretty quickly—probably a sign of a significantly smaller budget than something like GTA V got. I would even go so far as to say that Just Cause 3 was one of my favorite games in recent years, despite its flaws. In addition to playing the fun and goofy story, I spent dozens of hours working on getting better scores in its many races and stunts, and even more hours concocting absurd ways to bring pain to my enemies with the grappling hook, remote detonators, jets, and much more. In other words, I'm a fan—a fan who saw a 30-minute live gameplay presentation by the new sequel's developers at E3 this week. So how might a fan feel about that? Pretty good, for the most part. More crazy ways to cause chaos A battlefield's front line was the first thing we saw in the demo. Developers explained that the front line moves as you progress through the game. The further in the game you are, the farther the front line moves on the map in favor of your allies. The devs didn't explain exactly how this works. Player character Rico can cause the enemies at the front line a lot of pain—we saw the devs make a missile out of a gas tank using Rico's various tools, then shoot it the enemies on the front—but I'm guessing it moves based on your chaos level. That measure returns from prior games. It's a measure of how much destruction you're causing to the evil, oppressive force you're battling. The higher you drive the chaos level, the more Rico and his allies can control where things are going. To push that chaos level up, you have to destroy stuff—the enemy faction's buildings, cars, statues, monuments, infrastructure, and more. And the fun of Just Cause games is in the toolset they give you for accomplishing that. The developers called this the ""slum bridge,"" and said it's a major story hub. The tornado is hard to miss, and it's a key feature of the game. The wingsuit is back too. In the background, you can see objects the player has made hover using the new tools. There are new types of enemies. We saw one enemy type that held up shields, requiring you to kill them with explosions from behind. At it's heart, this is still a game about blowing stuff up. A lot. There are several new vehicles. Some of them are resistant to tornadoes and the game's wind physics, but most aren't. Just Cause 3 's primary tools were a grappling hook, remote detonation mines, a parachute, and a wingsuit. There were some fun variations; the grappling hook could be used not just to propel Rico around, but to tie objects or enemies to each other. You could connect an enemy vehicle to an explosive gas tank, then draw the line shorter until they collided and exploded. You could connect multiple objects in a chain of destruction. There was also a variant on the remote mines that turned the mines into jets, propelling whatever you attached them to into until that object (or person) exploded. Just Cause 4 has all of those things. It adds some fun new variations too. Now you can set those attachable jets to never explode, so you can make a crane turn into an eternally spinning wrecking ball. You can attach jets that make objects hover, then program them to follow you around or behave in other ways. In one example, the developer found two large, explosive objects, attached the hover jets to them so they flew in the air, then programmed them to follow him. He proceeded to fly with his wing suit and lead them over an enemy base, then let them fall and blow up, destroying numerous enemies. The grappling hook now has a new upgrade tree, and you can customize it to do new things, though we didn't see all of these in the demo. Just Cause 4 takes all the physics-based tools that made Just Cause 3 an enjoyable sandbox and adds more tools that are very much in the spirit of its predecessor. Series fans won't be disappointed on that front. The tornado You probably saw that giant tornado in the trailers. The developers say that the tornado is a full-fledged physics simulation, along with all the other wind and weather in the game. It looks great, and it really does drift around the map sucking enemies, civilians, and objects up. It wasn't clear during the demo whether the tornado is always there, or whether it just shows up sometimes. I got the impression it was the former, though. That's because enemy bases are equipped with devices that essentially act as tornado repellers. But Rico can destroy those. In fact, he can selectively destroy them in clever ways to essentially direct the tornado where he wants it to go. I saw the developer who was playing the game do just that to drive the tornado into an enemy base. He also shot a bunch of rockets into the tornado, making it even more deadly; we could see the rockets spinning around precariously and hitting hostile buildings and vehicles. The tornado did worry me in terms of performance. At certain times, it had sucked up what looked like hundreds of cars, ragdoll people, and building fragments, with explosions and particle effects to boot. It looked good on the PC the team was demoing it on, but that's a lot to calculate, and I'm not confident the OG PS4 and Xbox One are up to the task. (The PS4 Pro, the Xbox One X, or a solid Windows gaming PC should able to handle it though.) If console players don't have the latest hardware, I'm pretty sure they'll be dipping under 30fps again. It's this sort of thing that makes me think Just Cause 4 might not be the watershed moment that was hoped for. It's more of the same set of priorities—more zany options over polish and refinement. But that's also good news for fans of the previous game. It just means this likely won't win over anyone who didn't like the last one. A more-varied world Right at the beginning of the demonstration, the developers admitted that fans had criticized the sameness and lifelessness of their previous open worlds. They said fixing that was a priority in this sequel. From what I saw, I'm expecting an improvement, but not a reinvention. On one hand, the world is more varied, with several visually distinct regions. The developers making the presentation referred to them as biomes. Having a few unique areas is a lot better than the overwhelming sameness of the previous game's (otherwise lovely) setting. But on the other hand, I didn't see much to suggest that the world feels lived in or fleshed out in the way that the worlds of Grand Theft Auto V or Mafia III do. Just Cause 3 was like Saint's Row or early Assassin's Creed titles; there were people in the streets, but they all looked the same, and none of them seemed to do anything but wander aimlessly, waiting to be blown up. Viewed up close, the world's little details just didn't hold up—because they weren't even there. I didn't see in anything in this demonstration to suggest that it's any different in Just Cause 4. But maybe that doesn't matter. After all, you'll spend most of the game flying high above it all and raining death from above. And it's not a game about experiencing a living, breathing world; it's a game about having fun blowing stuff up in endlessly creative and goofy ways. I have no doubt Just Cause 4 will deliver in spades on that front. I'm already concocting crazy schemes in my head to achieve maximum chaos when the game releases.",There's gleeful chaos to be had If the last game's tech issues are addressed,2018-06-14T13:16:54Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Is Just Cause 4 the polished sequel fans hoped for?

Chip Brownlee | Editor-in-chief,"Quick Notes:
One of two Tornados that his the area has a preliminary rating of EF-4 with 170 MPH winds. 
The death toll remains at 23, though officials warn it could rise.
Officials are still working to identify all of those killed by the storm.
Three children were among the 23 people killed by a powerful tornado EF-4 tornado that hit southern Lee County on Sunday, officials said Monday.
Birmingham National Weather Service chief meteorologist Chris Darden said the tornado was nearly a mile wide at .87 miles and stayed touched down on the ground for at least 24 miles. It had winds of 170 miles per hour.
The track could be longer.
It was the deadliest tornado in the United States since 2013, and it was the first EF-4 tornado in Alabama since 2011, Darden said. Another smaller EF-1 tornado crossed paths with the larger tornado.
GALLERY: Officials speak at a press conference one day after deadly tornado
It was ""a monster tornado as it moved across the area,"" Darden said.
The three school-aged children who died in the storm were ages 6, 9 and 10, according to Lee County Coroner Bill Harris.
""Y'all, we will overcome this loss. We have done it before, we will do it again, and we will do it together,"" Gov. Kay Ivey said at the press conference.
One of them, Taylor Thornton, has been identified by her school, Lee-Scott Academy. The 6-year-old has been identified as Armando Hernandez. The other victims have not been identified by authorities. Harris said 22 of the victims died at the scene of the tornado, and one died in a hospital from critical injuries.
East Alabama Medical Center said they have been treating at least 40 people injured in the storm. Some of those were in critical condition, Sheriff Jay Jones said.
Jones said the death toll is steady at 23 for now, but there are still ""dozens"" of homes that have not been searched yet. He and the coroner warned that the death toll could rise as crews are able to comb through miles of damage.
""We have not completed our searches,"" Jones said, though the most significant damage at a mobile home park near Beauregard has been searched.
Search teams have been working the scene since Monday morning. They searched on Monday night, as well, but efforts had to be called off temporarily overnight. More than 100 people arrived to help with the search teams.
""We had an overwhelming response from the community, from all over the state and from our friends in Georgia, as well,"" Jones said. 
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey speaks at a press conference at Beauregard High School on March 4, 2019, one day after a tornado killed 23 people in the area.
Harris said he is working with families to make sure they are notified as quickly as possible. Most of the families have already been notified, but six of the victims could not be positively identified with sight. He said they will need to be identified using finger prints.
Missing persons can be reported to the Lee County EMA or the Lee County Sheriff's Office.
National Weather Service Birmingham meteorologist Chris Darden speaks at a press conference on March 4, 2019. He said the tornado was an EF-4.
""This is the worst natural disaster that has ever occurred in Lee County,"" said Lee County EMA Director Kathrine Carson. ""Most of us cannot remember anything ever creating this much loss of life.""
Carson said President Donald Trump called Lee County's emergency operations center Monday morning and offered his support after he called Ivey.
The governor extended a state of emergency after the storm Sunday evening.
""We lost children, mothers, fathers, neighbors and friends,"" Ivey said. ""To know Alabama is to know that we are a tight-knit community of people. And today, each of us mourns the loss of life of our fellow Alabamians.""
Ivey said all of Lee County is focused on Alabama.
""I want you to know, I've got your back,"" Ivey said. ""We will do everything in our power to help the citizens of Lee County recover.""
Jones and Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes have warned against price gauging for hotels  and other necessities. 
The National Weather Service began issuing alerts and outlooks that tornadoes would be possible on Thursday. 
""We raised alarm bells,"" Darden said.
He noted that official warnings aren't issued until the tornadoes form. Two tornado warnings were issued Sunday in Lee County. 
""We had tornado warnings for Lee County 8 to 10 minutes before it actually hit the Beauregard community,"" Darden said.

Tom Murray,"What's worse than a tornado? A fire tornado, of course. That's what firefighters in British Columbia were faced with when they attempted to keep rampant wildfires under control. In footage that has gone viral on Twitter, firefighters can be seen grappling with a fire tornado that has sucked their hose into the vortex. The obvious highlight of the video is when a firefighter hurls a rock at the fire tornado out of frustration. The video was posted on Instagram by wildland firefighter M.C. Schidlowsky who wrote in the caption: ""Fire tornado destroyed our line. It threw burning logs across our guard for 45 minutes and pulled our hose 100 plus ft in the air before melting it. That's definitely a first."" Schidlowsky added that the tornado was over 200ft tall ""but the smoke was too think to see it clearly on video."" What exactly is going on here? Mashable spoke to a fire scientist (which is apparently a real job) who told them that the phenomenon was ""a classic fire whirl."" Michael Gollner, who researches fire whirls at the University of Maryland's Department of Fire Protection Engineering, told the publication: ""It's very common for smaller whirls to occur in fires."" ""They're more akin to dust devils."" According to Live Science, fire whirls are ""created by hot, dry air rising rapidly from the ground."" ""As hot air rises from the ground, it forms vertical columns, or ""chimneys"","" Marc Lallanilla writes. ""As more hot air is pulled into the rising column, it begins to swirl in a vortex, not unlike the vortex that's formed when water drains from a bathtub."" Gollner told Mashable that these events are becoming more common because of global warming: ""The more days that you have extreme fires, the more likelihood you have to see giant fire whirls."" ""Typically, you see a fire whirl and you would leave the area — they tend to be unpredictable events,"" he added.

Associated Press,"TAYLORVILLE, Ill. -- The Latest on tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. (all times local): 5:55 p.m. Meteorologists in Arkansas have confirmed that at least three tornadoes developed from severe thunderstorms on Friday night. The National Weather Service said Sunday that a strong tornado touched down in Van Buren, Arkansas, about 130 miles (212 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock. The tornado was rated an EF2, which indicates wind speeds as high as 135 mph. About 10 minutes later, a second weaker tornado was confirmed less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away near the town of Rudy, Arkansas. Damage surveys for the two tornadoes are ongoing but officials said dozens of homes were damaged. Early Saturday morning a third tornado with estimated peak winds of 107 mph traveled about 8.5 miles (13.5 kilometers) through Spring Hill in southwest Arkansas, about 110 miles (178 kilometers) from Little Rock. Its path was intermittent and mostly caused damage to trees and to some structures. No injuries or fatalities were reported as a result of the tornadoes. ___ 5:25 p.m. The National Weather Service says a rare wintertime tornado that struck Taylorville in central Illinois was half-a-mile-wide and stayed on the ground for at least 10 miles (16 kilometers). Weather service meteorologist Chris Miller told The Associated Press on Sunday the agency was able to give Taylorville an advanced warning of 41 minutes that the powerful tornado was headed the community's way. The Saturday warning estimated the twister would arrive at 5:20 p.m. and it struck at 5:21 p.m. The warning helped residents take cover and may have saved lives. Around 20 people were injured, but there were no deaths. December tornadoes are rare. At least 12 were reported in Illinois on Saturday. If most are confirmed as tornadoes, Miller said that would be the most tornadoes in Illinois in a December storm since Dec. 18-19, 1957, when there were 21. ___ 1:25 p.m. The National Weather Service has confirmed two tornadoes touched down in eastern Oklahoma and is chasing reports of multiple other tornadoes as part of severe thunderstorms Friday night. Meteorologists said Sunday a tornado with peak winds of 115 to 125 mph caused severe damage in northwestern Sequoyah County. Multiple homes, boats and power lines were destroyed. The tornado traveled at least 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast, though investigators are still determining its end location. Another smaller tornado developed earlier in the evening near Webbers Falls which uprooted trees and damaged irrigation systems and barns. That tornado traveled about 7 miles (11 kilometers) just past the town of Gore. Up to three other tornadoes are being investigated in eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas. No injuries have been reported. Severe thunderstorms also raked Illinois and Missouri on Saturday. One person was killed in Missouri. ___ 12:50 p.m. Residents in central Illinois are assessing damage from rare December tornadoes that ripped roofs off homes, downed power lines and injured at least 20 people. The Springfield Journal Register reports the National Weather Service sent crews Sunday to survey the hardest-hit areas, including Taylorville, 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Springfield. Assistant Fire Chief Andy Goodall spoke to reporters Saturday night after the storms raked the city of 11,000. He said at least 100 homes had major damage, including his own. A Taylorville Memorial Hospital spokesman said 21 people, from age 9 to 97, arrived for treatment Saturday. Most were discharged within hours. No deaths have been reported in Illinois.

JOHN SCHWARTZ,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. Hurricane Michael was a sly storm, one that seemed almost unexceptional at first. It followed its predicted path with seeming obedience, but then burst into sudden fury as it approached the Florida Panhandle, reaching wind speeds at the cusp of Category 5 strength and leaving mud and rubble in its wake. It was, in other words, a hurricane: the product of multitudinous forces that blend heat, wind and moisture into a potent threat, with a whopping dose of chance thrown in. Influences on the formation, direction and strength of hurricanes can involve faraway events like dry air from Saharan dust storms, the heated waters of El Niño in the Pacific, the undulations of the jet stream. Increasingly, climate change is part of the dangerous mix as well. Little wonder that modern weather modeling got its start in chaos theory, which acknowledges that small changes can lead to enormous effects so that, as one founder of the field put it, the flap of a butterflys wing in Brazil might set off a tornado in Texas. In the case of Michael, the National Hurricane Center forecast the storms path with great accuracy, but its sudden intensification as it approached land was harder to predict. Millions of residents were caught off guard as Michael escalated from a tropical storm to a major hurricane in just two days, leaving little time for preparations.","Predicting the storm’s path was straightforward, but a number of factors contributed to its sudden intensification.",2018-10-11T16:33:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why Hurricane Michael’s Power Caught Forecasters Off Guard,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/climate/hurricane-michael-science.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/12/climate/12CLI-STORMEXPLAINER1/12CLI-STORMEXPLAINER1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tornado,1
Associated Press,"The National Weather Service has issued tornado watches for parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas and says those states face an “enhanced risk” for severe weather.
The watches come just a week after powerful twisters swept through Alabama and killed 23 people.
A tornado watch means conditions are favorable for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area. The watches issued Saturday for Tennessee and Mississippi were in effect until 6 p.m. EST; for Arkansas and Louisiana, 4 p.m. EST.
The weather service’s Storm Prediction Center also warned of damaging winds and large hail and said via Twitter that cities at risk include Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee; Southaven, Mississippi; and Louisville, Kentucky.

Madeline Farber,"Severe thunderstorms ravaged across the northeast on Tuesday, prompting the National Weather Service to issue tornado warnings for various counties in Connecticut, including Hartford and New Haven. At least two people died as a result of the severe weather. A man was killed in Connecticut Tuesday afternoon when a tree fell on his truck. And in New York, an 11-year-old girl died when a tree toppled onto the car she was in. Read on for a look at why tornadoes occur and what to do if you’re caught in one. What is a tornado? A home after a tornado passed through part of Alabama earlier this week. (AP) Essentially, a tornado is a column of “rapidly rotating air that comes from a powerful, towering thunderstorm” also known as a supercell, Janice Dean, Fox News’ Senior Meteorologist, said in an email. The column of air typically forms from the supercell, stretching down and eventually reaching the ground below. When this happens, the column takes the shape of a funnel -- also known as a funnel cloud, according to the Ready Campaign, a national public service campaign that helps Americans respond to natural and man-made disasters, among other things. When do tornadoes typically occur? Homes are severely damaged after a tornado hit the town of Emory, Texas, on April 30, 2017. (Reuters/ Brandon Wade) ""Peak tornado"" season hits the South in March and ends around May, the Virginia Department of Transportation says on its website. The severe weather pattern usually makes its way north, with the majority of tornadoes hitting northern states over the summer. “Half of tornadoes typically happen in May and June,” Harold Brooks, senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Severe Storms Laboratory, told AccuWeather in April 2017. However, tornadoes tend to hit the Gulf coast earlier during the spring, NOAA explains on its website. ""But, remember, tornadoes can happen at any time of year. Tornadoes can also happen at any time of day or night, but most tornadoes occur between 4 to 9 p.m.,"" NOAA adds. Tornadoes are more likely to pop up around the spring and fall, ""when warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico pushes into a colder air mass from Canada,"" Dean explained. ""Large thunderstorms often form when these air masses collide and a whirling, rotating funnel-shaped column of air can form inside these storms and then connect with the ground."" Why do tornadoes occur and how do they form? A man stands atop a smashed car in a tornado-ravaged neighborhood south of Oklahoma City. The F5 tornado killed some 44 people in May 1999. (Reuters ) Most tornadoes form from supercells, also known as a rotating thunderstorm or a mesocyclone. A supercell is typically a thunderstorm with the “winds already in motion,” according to National Geographic. It requires a combination of warm, moist air and cold, dry air -- which are the “ingredients for a regular thunderstorm,"" Brooks told the publication. To put it simply, warm, moist air near the earth’s surface begins to rise, blowing in one direction at one speed. Subsequently, the cold air above is blowing in a different direction at a different speed. This creates a wind shear, which causes the air to rotate in a column. From here, if the air column gets caught in the updraft of a supercell, it causes the air to spin faster and create a funnel shape. The funnel of air becomes a tornado as it extends toward the earth and reaches the ground below. It’s worth noting, however, that supercells are relatively rare. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), supercells are the least common type of thunderstorm.” Roughly one in a thousand storms become supercells. From there, only one in about six of those supercells will become a tornado, National Geographic reports. But if they do form, “they have a high propensity to produce severe weather, including damaging winds, very large hail, and sometimes weak to violent tornadoes,” according to the NWS. Tornadoes are also unpredictable. While tornadoes are ""spawned by strong thunderstorms, not all strong thunderstorms end up predicting tornadoes,"" Dean said. Weather forecasters can't predict which storms will produce tornadoes with 100 percent certainty, but they ""can forecast where supercell thunderstorms are likely to develop,"" Dean explained. Where do tornadoes typically hit? While tornadoes can form almost anywhere given the right conditions, they commonly touch down in Florida and an area of the U.S. called “Tornado Alley.” Tornado Alley, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), is a “nickname given to an area in the southern plains of the central U.S. that consistently experiences a high frequency of tornadoes each year.” Tornado Alley includes parts of central Texas, then moves into Great Plains states such as Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Parts of Iowa, Missouri and eastern Colorado are also considered part of Tornado Alley. Tornadoes are more likely to form in the southeast portion of the US from mid-April to early May, Dr. Jeffrey Basara, an associate professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, told Fox News. Then, from late April to early June, the twisters typically transition westward into the Great Plains, he said. From there, they are more likely to occur in the “corn belt region,” he said, which includes parts of Iowa, Indiana, Ohio and Minnesota, among a few other states. Norman, Oklahoma -- a city roughly 20 miles south of Oklahoma City -- is “climatologically, the worst of the worst"" for tornadoes, Basara said. In other words, while Tornado alley is a tornado hot-spot, this specific location is at an even higher risk, he explained. Scientists aren’t exactly sure why that is. (It’s worth noting that some of the most destructive tornadoes in recent years occurred just outside Norman in a town called Moore. A tornado in May of 1999 killed some 36 people, where one in May 2013 killed 24). What can you do to protect yourself during a tornado? The intensity of a tornado is measured using the Enhanced Fujita scale, which ranges from an EF-0 to an EF-5. The latter is the most destructive and dangerous type of tornado. The winds from an EF-5 tornado can reach over 200 miles an hour. “The strongest ones can destroy large buildings, lift trees, and toss cars and trucks around like toys,” Dean said, adding that the average number of tornadoes reported across the U.S. has per year is about 1,200. To protect yourself from a tornado, it’s important to know the difference between a tornado watch and a tornado warning: a watch indicates a tornado could form, or “there are weather conditions that are favorable for tornadoes,” Dean said. A warning means a tornado has already been spotted. It’s paramount to have an emergency plan before a tornado. This means having enough food and water to last at least three days and to make sure everyone knows where to go before the tornado hits. “The strongest ones can destroy large buildings, lift trees, and toss cars and trucks around like toys."" - Janice Dean Some homes in Tornado-alley are equipped with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-approved “safe rooms,” which, according to the organization, is a “hardened structure specifically designed to meet FEMA criteria and provide life-safety protection in extreme wind events, including tornadoes and hurricanes.” However, if you are not able to reach a safe room during a tornado, it’s best to go to the lowest level of a structure, such as a basement. It is important to stay away from all windows, doors or anything else that leads outside, the Ready Campaign recommends. Wearing a helmet and placing blankets, pillows or even a mattress over your body may protect you from debris if a tornado hits your home or a nearby building. If you do not have a basement, Dean also suggests hiding in a closet or bathroom on the ground level. “If you can, get under a sturdy piece of furniture, like a table,” she advised, adding that mobile-home owners should seek alternate shelter because they offer little protection. “Get out of automobiles. Do not try to outrun a tornado in your car, leave it immediately. If you’re outside, go to a ditch or low-lying area and lie flat in it,” Dean said. “Stay away from fallen power lines and stay out of damaged areas.” After a tornado is over, stay indoors until it is safe to come out. ""Check for injured or trapped people without putting yourself in danger,” Dean said. Be on the lookout for any downed power lines and use flashlight to inspect your home, Dean added. (To find out what else you should do before, during and after a tornado, you can read more here ). “Severe weather is not something to take lightly. I think too often we do; there are many misconceptions about the accuracy of forecasting, but we’ve come a long way,” Basara said. “It’s important to take that information seriously and heed the warnings.” Fox News’ Janice Dean and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Clayton Stiver,"READING, Pa. - ***TORANDO WATCH IN EFFECT FOR LEBANON, LANCASTER, BERKS, CHESTER, MONTGOMERY, BUCKS, DELAWARE, PHILADELPHIA, BURLINGTON, CAMDEN, GLOUCESTER, SALEM, AND NEW CASTLE COUNTIES UNTIL 1 AM SUNDAY*** As advertised, we’ve seen some drastic differences in temperatures across the region today due to a warm front slowly advancing east-northeastward from our south and west. Many of us have remained on the cool side of this boundary today with a northeasterly wind flow and plenty of clouds. High temperatures today for many have only reached the low 60s and areas in the Poconos and northwestern New Jersey didn’t even get out of the 50s. We saw one round of rain early this morning, then it was dry for a while, but now we will watch the skies for widely scattered showers and t-storms moving through the evening. The aforementioned warm front will try to push a little further north and east across the region over the next several hours. As it does so, it’s very well possible southern areas like southern Berks County into Lancaster County and over through Chester County, lower Bucks/Mont, and the Delaware Valley and southern New Jersey get into the warm sector below the front and see temps climb into the 70s with clearing skies. Unfortunately in these areas, these conditions will allow the atmosphere to become fairly unstable, and as a wave of low pressure moves eastward along the warm front, scattered showers and storms will bubble up and move through. In these southern areas where it will be warm and humid, the combination of that with strong winds a loft will lead to an enhanced severe weather threat. Damaging wind gusts, large hail, and torrential rain will all need to be watched for and an isolated tornado can’t be completely ruled out. By the time you reach I-78 however and certainly north of there, we will likely stay in the cool, more stable air mass, and hence the severe t-storm threat is greatly reduced here. Regardless, some heavy downpours, gusty winds, and small hail will still be possible. Once we get past 8pm a lot of this activity may be exiting the region to the south and east. Folks in the Philly area down into Delaware and southern New Jersey however may still have to contend with stronger t-storms for a bit and it may not be until after 10pm that they get done with the activity there. Eventually as we work through the overnight hours, our aforementioned warm front will change to a cold front and move south as low pressure moving along it continues sliding eastward and eventually moves off the coast. While the t-storm threat will come to an end, lingering low-level moisture will remain keeping plenty of clouds around with occasional showers and areas of drizzle. Low temperatures should fall to either side of 50 degrees. Mother's Day Sunday will be cool, damp, and dreary for most of the region. On and off rain and drizzle will continue throughout the day on Sunday as the aforementioned front advances slowly to the south but remains close enough to keep plenty of clouds around and moisture. With the clouds and occasional rain will also come an easterly onshore fetch of wind. All of these things don’t bode well for temperatures to rise. We will likely be lucky if we get to 60 degrees Sunday and there will be several spots that don’t get out of the 50s. Fortunately, the rainfall rates look to be light. Late Sunday into Monday our pesky frontal boundary should sneak far enough south that some drying can occur. However, even though temperatures will bounce back into the mid 70s on Monday, then top out in the low 80s Tuesday, and well into the 70s Wednesday and Thursday, a corridor of moisture is always looming near. This all means we can expect variable clouds for much of next week with daily chances for showers and thunderstorms with the warmer and more humid air in place. A cold front may move through by the end of next week dropping temperatures off, but the front may also linger nearby into at least the start of next weekend making for more shower and t-storm chances.

Rachel Reeves,"As frigid air plunges into and builds over the central United States, a stormy pattern with snow, ice and rain may unfold from Texas to Maine for Christmas holiday travelers. During a typical winter, this weather pattern can bring a storm and travel concerns once every five to seven days. However, with the pattern anticipated from Dec. 21 to Dec. 26, there is the potential for two storms that may be disruptive to travel in areas from the Rockies and southern Plains to the Midwest and Northeast states. ""The key to which areas stand the best chance of snow and/or ice will depend on how far to the south and east frigid air pushes out from the North Central states,"" according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Mike Doll. The first storm and its snow will primarily be a concern from the northern Rockies to the Upper Midwest later this week.

REUTERS/Brandon Wade In the wake of this storm, colder air may settle from parts of the southern Plains to part of the Ohio Valley on Saturday, Dec. 23. Meanwhile, most areas along the Atlantic Seaboard can expect above-normal temperatures for late in the week. Since cold air will not be established in time for the arrival of precipitation in the East, most travelers in the Northeast will likely have to deal with delays associated with rain, fog and a low cloud ceiling around Saturday, Dec. 23. Some pockets of ice and snow are possible over parts of the northern Appalachians. ""We have concerns for a second storm to spring up in the south between Dec. 24 and Christmas Day,"" Doll said. How quickly the cold and the next storm move eastward will determine which areas might get snow and ice. One scenario brings the cold air eastward with the storm riding along the Northeast coast on Christmas Day. This would keep it generally dry across the Upper Midwest with areas of lake-effect snow. Snow and ice may be a concern for the Northeast. The second scenario has the storm and cold air moving eastward even more quickly. Should this be the case, the Midwest and Northeast would trend drier and colder, aside from traditional bands of lake-effect snow. In this scenario, some snow and ice may make another visit to parts of the Deep South on Christmas Eve as the storm quickly passes through.

JILL COLVIN / AP,"AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — President Donald Trump surveyed damage on Friday from a deadly tornado that devastated a small Alabama town, killing nearly two dozen people.
Trump and first lady Melania Trump, flew south to Georgia and then took a helicopter to Alabama, landing at a regional airport in Auburn. The Trumps greeted people awaiting their arrival before departing by motorcade.
The president was expected to tour rural Lee County in eastern Alabama, where 23 people died Sunday in a massive EF4 tornado that carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide with 170 mph (270 kph) winds. Air Force One first landed at a military base along the Georgia border, where Trump boarded a helicopter for an aerial tour of some of the damage.
It was one of at least 38 tornadoes confirmed to have touched down across the Southeast in a deadly weekend outbreak.
As he left Washington, Trump said he expected to meet with Gov. Kay Ivey and people who “got hit very hard by the tornadoes.” He also planned to thank first responders.
Trump has said he’s instructed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to give Alabama “the A Plus treatment” as the state recovers.
The Alabama damage was officially deemed a disaster on Tuesday, with Trump ordering federal aid to supplement ongoing state and local recovery efforts.
Ivey has also signed a disaster assistance agreement with FEMA and ordered state flags flown at half-staff until sunset Sunday.
The Beauregard, Alabama tornado was the deadliest to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
The dead included four children and a couple in their 80s, with 10 victims belonging to a single extended family. Several people in Georgia were also injured by twisters that also extended to Florida and South Carolina, according to the National Weather Service.
Trump had said earlier this week that the country was “sending our love and prayers to the incredible people of Alabama” and that “whatever we can do, we’re doing.” He was traveling to politically friendly territory for him: Alabama supported Trump by a wide margin in the 2016 presidential election.
The area where the tornado struck is generally Trump country: He carried about 60 percent of the Lee County vote in 2016, and blue Trump flags flying outside homes are a frequent sight in Beauregard.
Standing amid bricks and lumber that used to be her mother’s home, Renee Frazier waved at Trump’s helicopter as it passed overhead during an aerial tour of the destruction. Minutes before, she was arguing with relatives who opposed Trump’s visit, calling it more about politics than compassion.
“I want the president here to see what happened to my mom’s house,” she said. “I want him right here on this land because my mom is about love and unity.”
Just down the road, where several people died, Trump supporter Bobby Spann said he hoped the president learned “how to be a Southerner, and how to respect people” during his brief visit.
Spann, 63, said he also hoped Trump realizes how much help is needed. The roof of Spann’s mobile home was partially peeled away.
“Houses need to be replaced. You can’t help the dead folks, but you can try to help the ones that’s still living,” said Spann, chewing on a yellowroot twig.
Trump’s reaction to natural disasters at times has seemed to vary with the level of political support he’s received from the affected region.
In the months after wildfires ripped through California, Trump threatened to cut off federal aid unless the state embraced forest management policies he championed.
He also engaged in a sustained back-and-forth with lawmakers from hurricane-whipped Puerto Rico, repeatedly blaming the territory for its problems and noting how much money recovery efforts had cost the federal government.
The administration at one point considered redirecting disaster aid from places like Puerto Rico and California to pay for the president’s long-promised border wall. The administration ultimately chose to target other sources of federal dollars.
Trump had already been scheduled to fly south Friday for a weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago club and will be heading there after the tour.

Mark Kaufman,"Thousands of miles away from the deadly deluges brought by the now-tropical depression Florence, wildland firefighters are still battling extreme blazes out West. An intense video posted to Instagram on Sunday shows a firefighting crew's violent meeting with a large fire vortex, known scientifically as a fire whirl. SEE ALSO: A fire tornado hit California. Here's how it happened. Wildland firefighter M.C. Schidlowsky — whose Instagram handle is mar.lowsky — posted the video taken in British Columbia, showing the vortex sucking a firehose up into the churning winds. The crew was powerless pull the heavy hose back. One firefighter, after the vortex ripped the hose away, hurled a rock at the fire, seemingly in frustration. This fire whirl event was starkly different than the colossal fire tornado spawned during California's Carr Fire in July, wherein a towering 16,000 foot-tall inferno spun in the City of Redding. ""It’s a classic fire whirl,"" Michael Gollner, a fire scientist who researches fire whirls at the University of Maryland's Department of Fire Protection Engineering, said in an interview. ""It's very common for smaller whirls to occur in fires,"" said Gollner. ""They’re more akin to dust devils."" Still, these fire whirls aren't weak events. Firehoses are heavy, especially the metal nozzles. This whirl sucked the hose up like paper. ""There was clearly a lot of momentum to have that much suction and pull,"" said Gollner, who could only speculate that the whirling winds were well over 100 mph. ""There was quite a bit of weight it was pulling up."" ""I’ve never seen a hose sucked up into a fire whirl before,"" he added. For any whirl to form amid a fire, something must cause a swirling motion, like erratic winds or gusts spinning off hills or topography. Such events are evidently quite common. ""It's very easy to generate a fire whirl,"" said Gollner. Although the events are common in fires, it's likely these vortexes are seen even more these days than they were 30 years ago. The reason is simple: The climate is warming, which means considerably more dried-out land and enhanced fire conditions in previous decades. About twice as much land burns in the U.S. today than in the early 1980s, and climate change is an integral reason why. ""There are more extreme fire weather days and more extreme drought than what was happening 30 years ago,"" noted Gollner. ""The more days that you have extreme fries, the more likelihood you have to see giant fire whirls."" In August — well before the fire season is through — 2018 became British Columbia's worst fire season in recorded history. The firefighters in this video — for reasons known to these professionals working in the area — did not flee from this particular fire whirl. Though usually, anyone in the vicinity would be wise get a good distance from such a vortex, as they regularly throw flaming objects into the air and can ignite the vegetation behind you. ""That can be really dangerous,"" said Gollner. ""Typically, you see a fire whirl and you would leave the area — they tend to be unpredictable events."" ""Personally, I would have gotten away,"" he said.","Thousands of miles away from the deadly deluges brought by the now-tropical depression Florence, wildland firefighters are still battling extreme blazes out West.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Violent storms across swathes of the Southeast have caused several deaths and caused major flooding this weekend, with landslides also reported in several areas. Rain in parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee reached an astonishing one to one and a half feet, according to CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli.
Per the Associated Press, a tornado in Columbus, Mississippi killed one woman in a house undergoing renovation, while a man in Knox County, Tennessee drowned after his vehicle was submerged in floodwaters. The tornado resulted in 12 other injuries, but they are not believed to be life-threatening, Columbus Mayor Robert Smith Sr. told the AP. An additional death was reported in Craighead County, Arkansas, after a 76-year-old man and his vehicle was swept away by high water after seemingly driving around barricades, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Destruction in Columbus included damage at First Pentecostal Church that Rev. Steve Blaylock described as a total loss, while sheds and outbuildings in the citys east side were mostly demolished, the AP wrote. Used-car dealer Lee Lawrence said the storm demolished four buildings on his lot and blew out car windows, telling the AP it will be a start-over deal. I cant say it will come back better or stronger, but well come back.
The AP wrote:
A photographer working for The AP in Columbus said some antique cars on Lawrences lot were parked among the damage and a nearby pet grooming business appeared now to be mostly twisted piles of metal. A printing shop had been speared by a pipe with great force and what seemed to be a vacant commercial building nearby appeared heavily damaged.
Some 300 river gauges across the Southeast remained above flood levels on Sunday, according to CNN.
Tennessees Knox County was put under a flash flood warning on Saturday afternoon, CNN reported, with the National Weather Service advising residents that this is a particularly dangerous situation. Seek higher ground now. Amid the rising floodwaters, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency declared a state of emergency. Officials also implemented regional states of emergency in Alabama and Mississippi.
There were additional reports of rockslides wiping out part of Interstate 40 near the Tennessee-North Carolina border, with all lanes covered by rocks, trees, and dirt. Construction engineer Ted Adams of the North Carolina Department of Transportations District 14 told the Citizen Times it was a small slide with rocks falling from a pretty high elevation, and when they were hitting the road, they were bouncing into the eastbound lanes. The road may be closed for up to a week, the paper wrote.
Mudslides in Chattanooga also wiped out a Subway retail location on Saturday morning. Per the Times Free Press, owner Owen Megahee closed the location on Friday after observing an adjacent hill seemed about to collapse.
If they had it open, and employees and customers had been in there, wed be talking about something much more serious, fire department spokesman Bruce Garner told the paper. People could have been hurt or killed for sure.
Nearby, the Dunlap Fire Department posted a video of rising floodwaters spilling well over the boundaries of a waterway on Saturday.
The city of Nashville broke a rainfall record, with its February the wettest in over a century, CNN reported. In Lynchburg, between Nashville and Chattanooga, the grounds of the Jack Daniels distillery were flooded, though employee Henry Feldhaus IV told CNN that all employees and stores of whiskey were safe.
While the storms are largely over, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said that many of the floods will not crest until later in the week as rains continue to drain into waterways. According to the AP, tens of thousands of Appalachian Power customers in West Virginia remained without electricity as of Sunday afternoon.

Rachel Reeves,"A major storm will track close enough to the East Coast of the United States to bring snow to some areas and windy conditions to much of the Atlantic Seaboard later this week. The storm will have both direct and indirect impacts from Florida to Maine and Atlantic Canada. Arctic air will remain in place and will spread southward into Florida as the storm brews a few hundred miles offshore over the Atlantic Ocean and races northward on Wednesday and Thursday. During this period, the storm may undergo rapid strengthening, sometimes referred to as bombogenesis. At this time AccuWeather meteorologists believe the heaviest snow from the storm will fall on Maine and New Brunswick, Canada, where a blizzard is forecast to unfold.

REUTERS/Brandon Wade Homes are severely damaged after a tornado hit the town of Emory, Texas, U.S. April 30, 2017. REUTERS/Brandon Wade A blizzard is a storm that produces snow or blowing snow with winds in excess of 35 mph and a visibility of one-quarter of a mile or less for at least three consecutive hours. There is the potential for not only a foot (30 cm) or more of snow to fall, in Maine and New Brunswick, but also the risk of hurricane-force winds and frigid air at the same time. Tremendous blowing and drifting snow is likely and some communities may be isolated for several days in the wake of the storm. Some of these same communities may be without power. The storm is likely to track close enough to the coast to throw some moisture over land in the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast states. That moisture will be in the form of snow to some areas of the Atlantic coast from the northeastern corner of Florida to the coastal areas of the Carolinas and Massachusetts. Whether a few flakes or several inches of snow fall will depend on the exact track of the storm and how quickly moisture is thrown westward as the storm strengthens. There is a chance of enough snow to make roads slippery in Wilmington, North Carolina; Atlantic City, New Jersey; New York City and Boston. A significant amount of wind-driven snow may fall on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Even if the heaviest snow slides to the east, the combination of wind and lesser snowfall is likely to bring blizzard conditions at times to central New England. If the storm tracks within 100 miles of the coast, a blizzard and major travel disruptions may occur over the Interstate 95 corridor of the mid-Atlantic.

However, intermittent snow may fall in these areas from a fresh injection of arctic air arriving, while lake-effect snow ramps up once again near the Great Lakes. Regardless, as the storm strengthens, winds will increase hundreds of miles away from the center of the circulation beginning Wednesday and Wednesday night. Blustery and cold conditions are in store as far south as Florida, the Bahamas and Cuba. Winds strong enough to trigger airline delays are likely in the major hubs of the Northeast, from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia, New York City and Boston from Thursday to Friday. The strong winds and arctic air will add to the frigid weather pattern.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser urged residents to call the city if they saw people outside. ""We want every resident to have shelter and warmth,"" she said in a tweet. Many places across the United States experienced record low temperatures over the last few days. Omaha, Nebraska, posted a low of minus 20F (minus 29C), breaking a 130-year-old record, and Aberdeen, South Dakota, shattered a record set in 1919 with a temperature of minus 32F (minus 36C). The cold should ease across most of the country after Tuesday, but the northeastern section of the country will see a repeat of the frigid weather on Thursday or Friday as another arctic blast hits the area.

Jonathan M. Gitlin,"reader comments 2 The day before we drove the cars at Monticello, the weather was glorious. I'm a big fan of the current Mustang's styling. There's a more aggressive front splitter that comes with the Performance Pack 2. It adds 24lbs of downforce at 80mph and up to 60lbs as speeds get higher. At the rear, you know it's a Performance Pack 2 car by that little black spoiler. It's necessary to balance out the added downforce from the front splitter. The wheels are unique to the Performance Pack 2. Those Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. It's basically a cut slick. Sure wish the weather had been like this when it was my turn to drive it on track. Hagerty brought along a 1965 Mustang. I am regretting I didn't take it out for a quick drive on the road. 2018 Ford Mustang 12-inch LCD digital instrument cluster in Sport View. 2018 Ford Mustang 12-inch LCD digital instrument cluster in Track View. In April, Ford dropped a bombshell on us, announcing that it's going to cull almost its entire car lineup from the US market to concentrate on SUVs and crossovers. Not the Mustang though. The Blue Oval's sedans might not be selling well, but that's not the case for its sports car, which has topped the sales charts for the coupe market for the third year in a row. On Wednesday, Ford invited us up to Monticello Motor Club in New York to try out the latest flavor of pony car, the Mustang Performance Pack 2. Think of it as the ultimate all-round Mustang—a better daily driver than the hardcore Shelby GT350, but with almost all of that car's ability on track. Long-time readers will know that I rarely pass up an opportunity to visit a racetrack. That goes double if there's some seat time involved—triple if someone else is paying for fuel and tires. Which is why I didn't mind too much about the need to catch a 3:10am train from DC up to Manhattan, necessary to be there in time for the shuttle leaving for the track. (Being frugal with my travel budget, I wanted to avoid a night in a hotel.) Had everything gone to plan, the article you'd be about to read would be full of impressions from a day stress-testing this new Mustang. Unfortunately, Mother Nature had other ideas. Just like last time. What’s this Performance Pack 2 stuff? Let's say you're looking for a Mustang that can handle the odd track day better than the regular $35,190 5.0L V8 GT, but you don't want to go all-out with the GT350 version. You could go to town with aftermarket suppliers, buying new suspension components, uprated tires, and so on. Now, there's an easier way—simply spec your Mustang GT from the factory with the $6,500 Performance Pack 2. That cash gets you the following: bigger 15-inch Brembo front brakes with 6-piston calipers and track-tuned ABS; 305-ratio Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires all round, fitted to unique 19-inch wheels; MagnaRide magnetorheological dampers with track-tuned software calibration, plus stiffer springs and thicker front and rear anti-roll bars; a revised Track mode for the steering and stability control; a new front splitter and rear spoiler; and a 3.73-ratio limited-slip differential. Oh, and a six-speed manual transmission—you can't spec a PP2 Mustang GT with the 10-speed auto. Visually, the changes are subtle, for there are no extra badges like the Shelby. The easiest ways to know if a 'stang has these add-ons are 1) that new front splitter, which Ford says adds 60lbs (27.2kg) of front downforce; 2) the rear spoiler; and 3) the dark metallic wheels. Or, if you look a little closer, those Cup 2 tires, which feature barely any tread pattern to aid on-track ability. (They're borrowed from the Shelby, which uses the exact same size for its front tires, although that car has slightly wider rears.) But the 2018 Mustang fastback was already a fine-looking car. I bet it handles pretty good, eh? Last time Ford invited us to drive a Mustang on track, epic rain at Lime Rock Park in Connecticut turned up and spoiled things; as a result, we got a mere three laps on track before it was decided things were too wet to safely continue. They say history never repeats itself, and that's true—this time we managed four laps. The evening before, the East Coast was battered by a derecho, and the area around Monticello, New York, was unfortunate enough to be visited by a tornado. Trees were downed, as were power lines. Many roads were impassable. While conditions were improved on Wednesday, gray skies were here to stay. The plan was as follows: get four laps in early (with an instructor sitting alongside to remind me of the track layout) in Sport+ mode, then spend the rest of the day getting to know the Performance Pack 2-equipped GTs in all-out Track mode. But the rain showed up just as the last of the assembled journalists completed their initial runs, waterlogging the track again. Had the problem just been the rain, plan B would have been to spend the rest of the day testing the cars on the roads around Monticello instead. Sure, we'd have to leave them out of Track mode and wouldn't really learn much about how the cars behave at the limit. But that's better than nothing. Sadly, even plan B wasn't going to work. Of the three drive routes Ford had mapped out for us, two were off-limits. The county was under a state of emergency, and trees were blocking roads all over the place. On the one route that was still passable, the roads were covered in debris—not the sort of surface that's conducive to anything other than being very slow and cautious. I got a glimpse, and liked what I saw Looking back at my GT350 experience, I wrote that the two things that stood out were the brakes and the dampers. Unfortunately, I wasn't really able to delve into either of those aspects of the PP2 GT. On track in Sport+ mode, it found more grip than I was expecting on a drying track—even on the painted curbs, which the instructor exhorted me to use. Each drive mode recalibrates how the MagnaRide dampers adapt to the car in motion, sampling data from wheel speed sensors, pitch, roll, yaw, and a list of other sensors all via the CANbus at 1000Hz. In response, the system will firm up how each one compresses under load, responding in between 2-10 milliseconds to keep the car planted. Rather, the standout to me this time was how good the steering was. Direct, with plenty of feel of the road surface beneath you, and far more grip on the street or track than I'd have imagined possible given the conditions. No, I never got close to hearing a tire squeal during cornering, but out on the roads I also don't remember feeling the traction control intervene. For a 460hp (343kW) rear-wheel-drive car fitted with Cup 2 tires, that seems a little remarkable. I'm also a fan of the Mustang's new 12-inch digital instrument display. It's not quite as flashy as Audi's Virtual Cockpit—no full-screen moving Google Earth display here—but the giant tachometer in Track mode looks awesome. Annoyances? Other than the weather, I wasn't enthusiastic about the two analog gauges mounted to the dashboard between the air vents on the center stack—they looked a little cheap, and if I get to have permanent physical gauges of those sort, I'd prefer at least one of them to show me oil temperature. (Instead, you can see that on the digital display.) And the clutch caught me out once or twice—perhaps the bite point was set too low? Enlarge / By 11am, the Mustangs were parked in pit lane, and here they stayed for the rest of the day. That's the sort of thing that you get used to after a few hours in a car, but on this occasion we didn't have the chance. By midday, it was clear the conditions weren't going to improve; the track refused to dry, and with so many repair crews out on the roads trying to restore power and some normality to the local residents, the prudent thing was to head back to Manhattan and catch an earlier train home. Oh well, worse things happen at sea.

Gabriella Borter,"(Reuters) - Alabama search and rescue teams on Tuesday were combing through the wreckage of houses flatted by weekend tornadoes, looking for seven or eight people who remained unaccounted for in the wake of the deadliest U.S. twister outbreak since 2013. 
The tiny community of Beauregard, near the Alabama-Georgia border, was beginning to mourn the 23 people confirmed killed by the storms, which included four children and seven people from one family, officials said on Tuesday. 
The victims ranged in age from 6 to 93 years old, Bill Harris, coroner for storm-ravaged Lee County, told a morning news conference. 
“Just keep these families in your prayers,” Harris said. 
Most of the deceased were found in close proximity to their homes. The four children were age 6, 8, 9 and 10, officials said. 
County Sheriff Jay Jones said on Tuesday that search crews had narrowed their scope down to “the most affected areas” after scouring much of the county on Monday. He said he hoped the search and rescue effort would become a recovery effort by the end of the day. 
The tornadoes, stirred up by a late-winter “supercell” thunderstorm, toppled mobile homes and uprooted massive trees on Sunday with 170 mile-per-hour (274 km-per hour) winds. Forecasters ranked the worst of the outbreak at step four of the six-step Enhanced Fujita scale of tornado strength. 
The Beauregard community in the twister’s path might have had as few as eight or nine minutes to seek shelter from the time the warning was issued, National Weather Service chief meteorologist Chris Darden said. 
In addition to 23 confirmed deaths, more than 50 people were reported injured, authorities said, making this the deadliest tornado outbreak since a massive tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma, in May 2013, killing 24 people and injuring 375 others.

Beth Skwarecki,"The President has the authority to send unblockable text messages to nearly every cell phone in the US, and a test of this system is scheduled for 2:18 p.m. Eastern time on October 3, 2018. But even though technically you can’t opt out, there are a few things you can try. First, let’s talk about how unblockable these really are: the Wireless Emergency Alert system was established in a 2006 law, and became fully operational in 2012. The original law says that wireless carriers can allow their customers to block emergency alerts, except the Presidential ones. The Presidential alerts are meant for situations of national importance: if a nuke were headed our way, for example, or some other serious, nationwide news. It’s not meant as an alternate outlet for petty, insulting tweets, and the message has to go through FEMA—it’s not sent directly from the President’s phone. Try turning off all emergency alerts (this probably won’t work) This shouldn’t work, but October 3 is your chance to figure out whether it actually does. A Presidential alert has never been sent before, so this is untested territory. Your phone should have a setting to let you turn off emergency alerts. This includes severe weather alerts (like tornado warnings) and AMBER alerts (the ones that ask you to keep an eye out for abducted children). On iPhone, go to Settings, then Notifications, and then scroll to the bottom to see government alerts. There are switches to turn off AMBER alerts and “Emergency alerts.” On most Android phones, go to Settings, and then Sound, and then Emergency Alerts. On Samsung devices, you’ll find options for emergency alerts in your Messages app settings instead. If you lucked out, and it turns out your phone does block the Presidential message, enjoy the peace while it lasts. The whole point of the test is to find out if the system works as designed, so your carrier or your phone’s manufacturer will have to fix the problem. Enjoy a 30-minute break from your phone This won’t block alerts in an emergency, but if you’d like to avoid the test’s mass phone-blaring at 2:18 p.m. (11:18 a.m. on the west coast), turn off your phone or set it to airplane mode until 2:48. That’s because each alert has its own “alert period” in which the alert, like a bird that keeps bonking against your window, will try frantically to reach you. If you’re on a call, you’ll get the alert when you hang up. If your phone was off, you’ll get the alert as soon as you turn it back on. But after the alert period has expired, that frantic little bird goes away. FEMA says the October test will use an alert period of “approximately 30 minutes.” At least put it on silent Emergency alerts come with a “tone” that is different from your usual notification ding. In practice, this tone is a blaring alarm that scares you half to death. But at least you can silence it. FEMA notes that “Consumers should receive a visual message if their phone is on silent.” So you can’t block the president’s text, but you can silence it, at least. If you’d like to share your thoughts on this test, FEMA invites the public to send feedback (ideally about whether you received the alert, but hey, you can send what you like) to FEMA-National-Test@fema.dhs.gov.","The President has the authority to send unblockable text messages to nearly every cell phone in the US, and a test of this system is scheduled for 2:18 p.m. Eastern time on October 3, 2018.

SCOTT MCFETRIDGE and DAVID PITT / AP,"(DES MOINES, Iowa) — A flurry of tornadoes swept through central Iowa Thursday afternoon, flattening buildings and damaging the courthouse in Marshalltown and hitting an agricultural machinery plant in Pella as people were working. Authorities said a hospital was evacuated and there were some injuries from the storms, but no reports of deaths. Hardest hit appeared to be Marshalltown, a city of 27,000 people about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Des Moines, where brick walls collapsed in the streets, roofs were blown off buildings and the cupola of the historic courthouse tumbled 175 feet (53 meters) to the ground. UnityPoint Health hospital in Marshalltown was damaged, spokeswoman Amy Varcoe said. Varcoe said all 40 of its patients were being transferred to the health system’s hospitals in Waterloo and Grundy Center. The Marshalltown hospital’s emergency room remained open to treat patients injured in the storm, Varcoe said. Ten people injured in the storm had been treated by 7 p.m. Thursday, she said. She did not know how serious those patients’ injuries were. Marshalltown resident Stephanie Moz said she, her husband and 2-month-old baby were in the downtown clothing store she owns when tornado sirens went off. The family sought shelter in the building’s basement and heard “cracking and booms and explosions” as the tornado passed. The storm broke out a window, ruining clothing and hats on display there, and destroyed her husband’s vehicle, but she said she’s relieved. “We went through a tornado and survived,” Moz said. “I’m happy.” Iowa State Rep. Mark Smith, who lives in Marshalltown, told Des Moines station KCCI-TV that the area likely will be declared a disaster area. Smith said his house and neighborhood were not damaged, but much of downtown and surrounding homes have been. “There are houses with windows out, houses without roofs,” he said. “It’s just an absolute mess.” Another tornado hit agricultural machinery maker Vermeer Manufacturing, where some people were still working, in the town of Pella, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of Des Moines. It scattered huge sheets of metal through a parking lot and left one building with a huge hole in it. Pella Regional Health Center spokeswoman Billie Rhamy said seven people injured at the Vermeer plant were treated at the hospital. All had minor injuries and were released after treatment, Rhamy said. Weather forecasters said the tornadoes formed suddenly and took them by surprise. Alex Krull, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Des Moines, said that forecasting models produced Thursday morning showed only a slight chance of strong thunderstorms later in the day. “This morning, it didn’t look like tornadic supercells were possible,” Krull said. “If anything, we were expecting we could get some large hail, if strong storms developed Additional funnels were reported as the storm moved east of Des Moines past Altoona, Prairie City and Colfax.",People were working inside the building when the tornado touched down,2018-07-20T01:18:40Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Tornadoes Sweep Across Central Iowa, Some Injuries Reported",http://time.com/5343804/tornado-des-moines-iowa/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/time-logo.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,tornado,1

Staff,"Two tornadoes touched down Saturday in New England, causing extensive damage. An EF-1 from Dudley, Massachusetts to Webster was reported at 110 mph while an EF-0 with winds up to 80 mph was reported in Woodstock, Connecticut. Trees are down and roofs were ripped from buildings, according to multiple reports. The National Weather Service confirmed the tornado early Saturday afternoon but said they are continuing to survey the damage, adding in a tweet that it will ""take quite some time"" to determine intensity, path and width of the tornado. The tornado warnings expired at 10:45 a.m. after being in effect Saturday morning for Worcester and Middlesex counties. The most significant damage appears to be along Main Street in Webster near the Dudley town line, according to a statement from the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said in a tweet Saturday that the significant damage in Webster and Dudley displaced both residents and businesses. This morning's tornado has caused significant damage in Webster and Dudley, displacing both residents and businesses. @MassEMA is coordinating the response with local officials, utilities and the @RedCrossMA. Thank you to first responders and others for your quick response. — Charlie Baker (@MassGovernor) August 4, 2018 ""[Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency] is coordinating the response with local officials, utilities and the [American Red Cross],"" Baker's tweet read. ""Thank you to first responders and others for your quick response."" Main Street at the Webster-Dudley line was shut down due to damage from the tornado. ""In Dudley, the main impacted locations include the Schofield Ave, Chase Ave, Central Ave, Cross Street, and West Main Street near the Webster line,"" Dudley Police Chief Steve Wojnar said in a statement. ""There are power outages and numerous roads, including much of Webster’s South Main Street, blocked by debris and trees. Several are Impassable. Non-emergency vehicle and pedestrian traffic are asked to stay out of the area, especially due to downed power lines."" The Uxbridge Fire Department confirmed building damage in Webster early Saturday, and images showed part of a roof that was ripped off of a Webster building. MEMA shared there have been reports of significant tree debris in Dudley, but no significant structural damage at this time. In Webster, three buildings were demolished, two commercial and one mixed use that includes several apartments in the upper levels, according to MEMA. An additional four to five buildings have been declared uninhabitable. Webster Fire Chief Brian Hickey said it was necessary to tear down three buildings that were deemed unsafe. The roof of the first brick building was torn completely off and it landed on the second building. ""Everything that's being torn down is being treated as hazardous waste,"" Hickey said. The fire chief, along with town administrator Doug Willardson, held a 2 p.m. press conference Saturday to provide an update. Hickey said the immediate concern is the safety of residents in the area, and crews will be focusing Saturday evening on restoration of power, telephone poles and getting downed trees out of the area. ""We're working to open up the streets and get things back in order,"" Hickey said. Willardson added, ""we'll get this cleaned up as soon as we can."" Hickey said most residents in town had their power back online; more than 880 Worcester and Essex County residents remained without power as of 2:45 p.m., and National Grid remained on scene to resolve the outages. At one point, more than 5,600 people were without power following the tornado Saturday. Webster Deputy Police Chief Michael Shaw told NBC10 Boston there was one minor injury but they are making sure everybody else who was affected by the event has been accounted for and is okay. ""It was a woman who was traveling on Main Street and a piece of debris hit her car and caused a minor injury. She was transported to the hospital but believe she is going to be okay,"" he said. Hickey confirmed that woman has since been treated and released for her minor injuries. He added she was inside her vehicle, driving down Main Street when the tornado came through. Hickey said when the roof of the first building came off, landing on the second and third building, part of it also landed on her car. Hickey said thankfully there were no other injuries. ""Extremely lucky... very fortunate to only have one minor injury,"" he said. Cleanup crews and utilities on the ground were on scene all morning and afternoon Saturday. ""We are running through with MEMA, and we have the Red Cross on scene, obviously the fire department and EMS, everyone is working,"" Shaw said. The deputy chief, who was in Worcester at the time the tornado touched down, added that the damage is pretty good in size, and that Main Street in Webster took the brunt of the damage. ""We've got several buildings that were affected, a couple of them were vacant. We do have some buildings that are contained apartments that unfortunately had to have residents evacuated,"" Shaw said. ""Our building inspector is checking to make sure that those are OK in case they are able to go back into them. If not, we have opened an emergency shelter. But we've got a lot of debris down, telephone poles snapping. From what I'm being told, the majority of the town is without power, so we're taking precautions. We have National Grid on scene, both gas and electric, making sure that we can try to resolve that situation as soon as possible."" Hickey said 30 to 50 people are homeless following the tornado. He added the American Red Cross is on scene to assist those people in finding temporary housing. Shaw said everything happened pretty quickly, and while images do show the damage, seeing it in person ""doesn't prepare you when it's your community."" ""We have a very dense downtown with a lot of buildings, and it could have been a lot, lot worse. And fortunately it wasn't."" Tia Durand-Paradis, of Southbridge, was in downtown Webster for a ribbon cutting ceremony when the tornado touched down. She described what she witnessed as the storm came through. ""The whole sky changed...it was just like sideways rain, and the windows kind of started rattling so everyone kind of made their way downstairs...by total luck the backdoor blew open which I think saved all of the windows from smashing, but the next store over, the costume shop, blew out every window that's in the place, and just a few doors down I guess took the roof right off the building, so it was pretty intense,"" she said. Durand-Paradis added that they were concerned because the Main Street buildings have all glass fronts. ""We were just focused on the glass not coming in at us,"" she said. ""Looking out at it, the only way I can explain it is if you were to stand in an automatic car wash, like it was just torrential downpour, and sideway winds and things just literally blowing by."" Durand-Paradis said she has never witnessed anything like it, adding it was pretty scary to experience. The owner of the Dancer's Sole on Main Street in Webster told NBC10 Boston they all took cover in the basement. ""We grabbed our stuff and ran downstairs and we heard a loud bang and the power went out and it was extremely scary, one of the scariest moments of my life,"" the woman said. ""I was honestly in shock and panic, and I don't even know, I ran, and my safety, and my mom's safety, and my staff's safety, that was my first priority. I didn't care about anything else. I just wanted to get to a safe area and make sure that we were going to be OK. Damage is damage and it can be fixed. You know, people can't be replaced so that's what's important."" She added her dance studio suffered a lot of damage. ""We do have a lot of damage, we do have windows blown out in our front studio, lots of glass, water. Our upstairs studio, part of the roof is missing so we can look up and see the sky which is a little devastating...we definitely have some work to do and repairs to get done,"" the business owner said. On Pleasant Street in Webster, an electrical pole snapped in half. One woman who has a business down the road from there discussed the devastating damage following the tornado. ""It took the whole roof off,"" the woman said. ""We have trees down, everything. It's our business, and it's destroyed. We lost everything over there."" The woman said she was at the store when it touched down. ""Thank God we weren't here, we probably would have been gone with it,"" she said. The business woman said she witnessed a lot of damage, including at stores like CVS and gas stations. She added it will take time to rebuild everything. The Auburn Fire Department sent ambulances to Webster for station coverage, as Webster was backed up on multiple calls for both Fire and EMS. The Southbridge Fire Department covered Dudley, as both Dudley and Webster received multiple calls due to the tornado. Willardson thanked all of the emergency responders Saturday and said they appreciate everyone who reached out. ""It's been an all around good effort to respond,"" the town administrator said. The town's senior citizen center was opened for a period Saturday to allow people to cool off. Meteorologists from the National Weather Service conducted damage surveys in Woodstock, over to Dudley and to Webster, according to a second tweet. They made the determination that it was a tornado. NBC10 Boston meteorologist Michael Page says it's all about the trees when surveying damage. He says the direction the trees fall is very telling. If the trees are perpendicular to each other, it would indicate there was rotation touching down. The National Weather Service team moved into Dudley around 2 p.m. Saturday afternoon as it continues to work southwest along the track towards Woodstock, Connecticut. The team will then work back toward Webster and toward Grafton as it continues to do an evaluation of the tornado's strength along the track. Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito surveyed the damage at 3 p.m. Saturday. Chief Hickey said the Department of Environmental Protection was also on scene to investigate the source of a spill into a nearby river. He added that booms and spill pads were placed in the river to try to contain the spill, but officials are not currently sure how much has spilled into the water. It's not immediately clear what kind of spill it is.","NBC Connecticut Officials Determine Strength of New England Double Tornadoes NBC Connecticut Two tornadoes touched down Saturday in New England, causing extensive damage.

Daniel Manzo,"A major storm developing in the central U.S. is bringing ongoing severe weather across the south, a flash flood threat to parts of the Gulf Coast and a major winter storm in the Northern Plains and upper Midwest. There was one reported tornado in eastern Oklahoma overnight as several tornado warnings were issued in the eastern parts of the state. Additionally, there were nearly 60 reports of strong winds from northern Texas to southern Missouri. Numerous tornado warnings were issued during the overnight hours in southern Missouri, where winds reached 83 mph. The U.S. averages 24 tornadoes in December with most developing in the southern U.S. A tornado watch is in effect for parts of Arkansas and Missouri on Saturday morning. A clear circulation was evident on radar and satellite imagery across Kansas on Saturday morning. This developing major storm will slowly move east during the day. A tornado watch is in effect for parts of Missouri and Arkansas through the early Saturday morning hours as a line of strong storms moves through the region. A couple of tornadoes will be possible through the early morning hours in the watch area. The risk will diminish by mid-Saturday morning in this region. Heavy rain has spread from eastern Kansas to Florida and snow is beginning to develop across parts of Nebraska. Heavy snow will fall in the Plains while severe storms and heavy rain move into the South on Saturday. Travel conditions will become hazardous on Saturday morning with heavy snow developing in parts of Nebraska and South Dakota. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour are likely with winds gusting to 35 mph in parts of the Northern Plains. This will cause near whiteout conditions. Winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories are in effect for much of the northern U.S. from Montana to northern Iowa. A slight risk for severe weather exists along the Gulf Coast and in southern Illinois on Saturday. The severe weather threat will nudge eastward later in the day Saturday with two main areas of concern under a slight risk for severe weather: the Gulf states from Louisiana to Florida, including much of Alabama, and parts of eastern Missouri and much of Illinois. In these slight-risk areas, strong winds, brief tornadoes and hail will all be possible. Additionally, an onslaught of heavy rain is expected for parts of the Florida Panhandle, extreme southern Georgia and Alabama. A flash flood watch has been issued for parts of this region, as locally 3 to 5 inches of rain is possible this weekend, with the bulk of it coming Saturday. This flood threat includes Panama City, Florida, and Dothan, Alabama. Heavy snow will fall on Saturday through parts of the Midwest and Northern Plains with a significant impacts to roadways and possible flight delays at region airports. Severe storms will move into the Southeast on Saturday night as snow continues to fall in the Plains. As some of this precipitation moves into the Northeast late Saturday night, it will encounter some colder air. As a result, some precipitation may fall as a mix of snow, freezing rain and sleet in parts of the interior Northeast. However, up to 1 inch of snow and a one-tenth of an inch of ice is expected from parts of New York to Maine. This could cause dangerous travel overnight Saturday into early Sunday morning. As warmer air moves in from the south on Sunday morning, temperatures will change the precipitation to rain. Borderline icy events can be extremely impactful on the roads. On Sunday, the severe threat will slide toward the Southeast coast with a slight risk of severe weather from parts of Georgia to extreme southeast North Carolina. In the slight risk area there is a possibility of strong winds, brief tornadoes and hail. A mix of rain and ice moves into the Northeast late Saturday and into Sunday morning. The greatest snow totals will be across parts of Nebraska, where locally over 1 foot of snow will fall. The combination of strong winds and heavy snow could cause some power outages in the region. Widespread snowfall totals of 6 to 12 inches are possible from Kansas to Wisconsin. The heaviest snowfall totals over the weekend will come in central Nebraska.",The storm sparked at least one tornado overnight.,2018-12-01T11:02:12Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Major storm bringing severe weather to South, whiteout conditions to Northern Plains",https://abcnews.go.com/US/major-storm-bringing-severe-weather-south-whiteout-conditions/story?id=59540477,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/oklahoma-hail-ugc-mo-20181201_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,tornado,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Riley MacLeod to Kotaku","Firestorm. Storm surge. EF-5 tornado. If you pay attention to the weather, these are undoubtably terms youve heard, along with dire warnings from meteorologists to heed any and all evacuation warnings. But the Weather Channel has upped the ante by creating what it calls mixed reality segments that drive home the risks in a way looking at maps just cant. While the effort launched in 2015, these videos have exploded from weather Twitter into the general populace in recent months. A storm surge video on Hurricane Florence garnered widespread media coverage and netted more than 2.3 million viewers on YouTube. The videos arent just a potent demonstration of the threat natural disasters pose. By weaving in climate change messaging, they drive home the risks of a warming world. The Weather Channels latest foray into mixed reality looks at wildfires. On-air meteorologist Stephanie Abrams stands amid a forest scene, describing how climate change has made fire conditions more explosive in the U.S. After laying out the weather conditions and sighting an errant ember, the forest lights up around her. The camera zooms out to capture the flames racing up the hillside and into a town on the other side. Along the way, facts appear like VH1's Pop Up Video. Abrams closes it out under a glowing red sky by noting that climate change means scenes like this could become a frightening new reality. In era of social media, images of burnt out homes and forests and neighborhoods washed away by storm surge abound. But they inevitably lack context and amid the cacophony of daily life, their warnings can slip from memory. As someone who has worked in the climate and weather for a decade, the videos take concepts I understand academically and make them feel incredibly visceral. I imagine the impact is even more powerful for people havent spent a ton of time thinking about weather or climate. It brings home the the risk of life and property more than anything I can think of, Greg Postel, an on-air meteorologist with the Weather Channel who has appeared in a mixed reality segment on storm surge, told Earther. To create the segments, the Weather Channel uses a green screen and special cameras coupled with graphics created by Unreal Engine, a graphics package behind Fortnite and other video games. Right now, the company is working with a Norwegian production crew called Future Group, and it takes about 3-4 weeks to produce a 1-3 minute video, according to Michael Potts, the Weather Channels vice president of design. He told Earther theyll ultimately be bringing production in-house and hope to be able to turn these out at a much faster clip. The Weather Channel can also repurpose visuals theyve already got down patthe storm surge scenario Postel starred in was modified during Florence and Michael, for instance. After showing National Hurricane Center inundation maps, both videos zoom out to show what the projected storm surge looked like in mixed reality. With Postel standing within a cone of dry studio like a modern day Moses, the waters rise around him, underscoring why you should evacuate if you have the means. I had all sorts of dreams maybe that someday we could have three dimensional animations of weather, Postel said of when he got his start in meteorology more than two decades ago. Were getting toward that. This winter offers a chance for new uses of mixed reality, from burying meteorologists in digital lake-effect snow to standing amidst the slurry of saltwater and ice that accompanies noreasters. But beyond showing the danger of various types of weather, mixed reality conveys the gravity of climate change. Its one thing for me to write that wildfire season is more than three months longer than it was in the 1970s or that storm surge is lifted by rising seas. Its another to layer that clear cut science within an immersive environment. I dont mean to get all hopeful, but it feels like the recent United Nations report warning the world has a decade to get control of the future climate coupled with the increasingly obvious impacts could be a turning point in how the public and media treat climate change (jurys still out on elected Republican officials ). The Weather Channels augmented reality is yet another way to drive home just how dramatic the choices are.","Firestorm. Storm surge. EF-5 tornado.

Dude... have you ever like... thought about how small we are... and how big the universe is...? These images show the Lagoon Nebula, just 4,000 light-years away, in intense detail. Hubble imaged the star-forming region both in visible light and infrared, with the latter allowing scientists to cut through the dust to peer at the stars forming inside. And the new views really show off Hubble’s abilities. “This thing is huge on the sky, about five times the size of the full moon, but it’s mostly too dim for our eyes to see,” NASA astronomer Michelle Thaller told Gizmodo. “It looks like a smudge with a pair of binoculars or a small telescope, but when the Hubble looks at it, it’s an incredibly beautiful, twisting tornado-like structure of dark dust.” More like infrarad. The Hubble spacecraft first launched in in 1990, and from its orbit around Earth it captures both visible and infrared light to study the night sky. It takes images in single wavelengths, which represent light emissions from different species of atoms. Scientists then process these images by mapping each light emission to a different color in order to create the image you’re seeing. More about that here.

Associated Press,"Residents in central Illinois on Sunday assessed the damage after rare December tornadoes, including one the day before that was a half-mile-wide, ripped roofs off homes in Taylorville, downed power lines and injured at least 20 people. The severe weather in Illinois was part of a line of thunderstorms that raked areas of the central U.S. late Friday and into Saturday, killing one person in Missouri. The National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes in Illinois, Missouri and Oklahoma. At least three tornadoes were confirmed in northwest and southwest Arkansas, which largely caused property and structural damage. No injuries or fatalities were reported. Peak months for tornadoes in much of the Midwest are April and June, according to the weather service. But at least 12 tornadoes were reported in Illinois on Saturday, including the Taylorville tornado, which has been confirmed. If the majority are confirmed, that would be the most tornadoes in Illinois in a December storm since Dec. 18-19, 1957, when there were 21. The weather service sent crews Sunday to survey the hardest-hit areas in Illinois, which included Taylorville, 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Springfield. Photographs and video from Taylorville showed several houses flattened, with residents wading into debris to salvage what they could. Some homes remained standing but with gaping holes in the roofs or with no roofs at all. The tornado was on the ground for around 10 miles (16 kilometers) before it thundered through Taylorville, and the weather service was able to warn residents of its arrival 41 minutes before it actually struck, Chris Miller, a meteorologist at the services Lincoln office, said in a phone interview Sunday. That advanced warning gave people critical time to take cover and may have saved lives. Assistant Fire Chief Andy Goodall, speaking to reporters Saturday night shortly after the storm pounded the city of 11,000, said at least 100 homes had major damage, including his own, Springfields State Journal-Register reported. A Taylorville Memorial Hospital spokesman said 21 people, from age 9 to 97, arrived for treatment Saturday. Most were released within hours. Miller said three people remained hospitalized as of Sunday afternoon. Miller said preliminary estimates are that the Taylorville tornado may have been an EF2, which indicates wind speeds as high as 135 mph. It could take several more days to know for sure. The weather service said Sunday that a strong tornado that developed from severe thunderstorms Friday night touched down in Van Buren, Arkansas. It was rated an EF2. About 10 minutes later, a second weaker tornado was confirmed less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away near the town of Rudy, Arkansas. Damage surveys for the two tornadoes are ongoing but officials said dozens of homes were damaged. Early Saturday morning a third tornado with estimated peak winds of 107 mph traveled about 8.5 miles (13.5 kilometers) through Spring Hill in southwest Arkansas. Its path was intermittent and mostly caused damage to trees and to some structures. ___ Associated Press writer Hannah Grabenstein in Little Rock, Arkansas, also contributed to this report.","HuffPost December Tornado Outbreak Hits Central US, Leaving At Least 1 Dead HuffPost Residents in central Illinois on Sunday assessed the damage after rare December tornadoes, including one the day before that was a half-mile-wide, ripped roofs off homes in T…",2018-12-03T05:31:00Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}","December Tornado Outbreak Hits Central US, Leaving At Least 1 Dead - HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/illinois-central-us-tornado-outbreak_us_5c04be4de4b0a173c02459ef,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c04bf2f2400006f0499bdfe.jpeg?cache=et6avtgx2u&ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,tornado,1
Time,"(REDDING, Calif.) — A rare fire tornado that raged during this summer’s deadly Carr Fire in Northern California was created by a combination of scorching weather, erratic winds and an ice-topped cloud that towered miles into the atmosphere, according to a study announced Wednesday. The churning funnel of smoke and flame killed a firefighter as it exploded in what already was a vast and devastating wildfire in July on the edge of Redding, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) north of San Francisco. The wildfire claimed eight lives and destroyed more than 1,000 homes before it was contained on Aug. 30. The study in the Geophysical Research Letters journal used satellite and radar data to suggest how a monstrous “firenado” the size of three football fields developed on July 26. It said the firenado was formed in much the same way as a regular tornado, which differs from the “fire whirls” that are formed only by heat from a wildfire. The only other documented case of such a “firenado” was during the 2003 Canberra fires in Australia, according to the study. A key factor was the development of a cloud generated by the fire itself that was ice-topped and grew quickly, doubling in length in just 15 minutes. It reached as high as 39,000 feet (7.4 miles or 11.9 kilometers), according to the study, which was published on Nov. 21. The development of that pyrocumulonimbus cloud “helped stretch the underlying column of air, concentrating the rotation near the surface” and causing tornado-strength winds that reached 143 mph, according to the study. “This paints a clear picture of the sequence of events leading to the vortex development and intensification,” said Neil Lareau of the University of Nevada, Reno, who co-authored the paper. Other factors included record high temperatures, low humidity and a “near-surface cyclonic wind shear zone,” according to the study. A wind shear occurs when the wind speed or direction suddenly changes, so that the wind actually is blowing in two opposite directions. The wind shear near the ground set up the spin that developed the fire tornado plume, Lareau said. “These observations may help forecasters and scientists identify – and potentially warn – for future destructive fire-generated vortices,” according to the study. Lareau is an assistant professor in the Physics Department of the College of Science. The article was co-authored by Nicholas Nausler of the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma and John Abatzoglou from the Department of Geography at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho.

Catie Keck,"Two men were killed in a partial building collapse at an Amazon Fulfillment Center in Baltimore late Friday in an incident resulting from severe weather, an Amazon executive confirmed Saturday. The incident occurred at Amazons facility BWI5, a sortation center that opened roughly four years ago and preps packages for shipping, according to Recode. Both of the individuals who were killed were contractors for the company, according to ABC-affiliate WMAR. The first man was found under some debris and was transported to an area hospital where he was later pronounced dead from his injuries. A second person was also killed as a result of this incident. Both people were third party contractors and not Amazon employees. Baltimore City Fire Department Chief Roman Clark said that a 50-foot wall collapsed at the facility after a storm descended on the city, according to the Baltimore Sun. The National Weather Service confirmed Saturday that the citys storm damage resulted from an EF-1 tornado. Brandon McBride, an employee who was working onsite at the time of the incident, told CNN-affiliate WBAL that he was standing inside the building when he and a facility worker suddenly heard these loud noises. He said the power shut off and described the scene as just crazy inside. It just sounded like bombs were dropping everywhere. The whole side (of the building) was just dropping, he said. Dave Clark, Amazons SVP of operations, confirmed the deaths in a statement on Saturday on Twitter. Last night severe weather impacted one of our Baltimore facilities resulting in 2 fatalities, he wrote. Thank you to the emergency response teams who have been working through the night. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those impacted by yesterdays tragic event. The site was still an active scene as of Saturday afternoon, and an Amazon spokesperson told the paper that the building had been closed. No other injuries were reported by Amazon.","Two men were killed in a partial building collapse at an Amazon Fulfillment Center in Baltimore late Friday in an incident resulting from severe weather, an Amazon executive confirmed Saturday.

Michelle Mark and Associated Press,"Two children were killed and multiple others were injured on Saturday after powerful storms ripped through Texas, spawning at least one suspected tornado. 
 A three-year-old and an eight-year-old in Pollok were crushed after a tree fell on their vehicle, the Angelina County Sheriff's Office said, according to AccuWeather. 
 Robertson County Texas Sheriff Gerald Yezak also told The Associated Press that a suspected tornado hit Franklin on Saturday, overturning mobile homes and damaging other residences. Franklin is a small city about 125 miles south of Dallas. 
 He says two people were taken to a hospital with injuries that aren't thought to be life-threatening and that about a dozen others were treated at the scene for minor injuries, including people who had to be extricated from their homes. 
 Yezak says two of the people injured Saturday when a likely tornado touched down near the cities of Hearne and Franklin were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. 
 National Weather Service meteorologist Monique Sellers says the agency received reports of downed trees, and damage to buildings and a transmission tower.

Associated Press,"(BEAUREGARD, Ala.) — A sheriff confirmed at least 14 people were killed by a possible tornado in Alabama on Sunday as severe storms destroyed mobile homes, snapped trees and left a trial of destruction and weather warnings extending into Georgia, Florida and South Carolina.
Dozens of emergency responders rushed in to assist in Lee County, Alabama, after what appeared to be a large tornado struck Sunday afternoon as part of a powerful storm system raking the Southeast.
“I can say that at this time we have 14 confirmed fatalities,” Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones told WRBL-TV. “And again the search continues. We still have some people that are reported missing.”
Authorities warned that the death toll could rise further as search efforts continued in the small community of Beauregard and surrounding areas. Jones said the storm’s path of destruction stretched for miles (kilometers) through his rural county, and in places was about a fourth of a mile (0.4 kilometers) wide. He didn’t have an immediate account of how many were believed missing.
Several people in Lee County were taken to hospitals, “some of them with very serious injuries,” Jones said.
Rita Smith, spokeswoman for the Lee County Emergency Management Agency, said about 150 first responders were assisting in the storm’s aftermath.
Multiple homes were destroyed or damaged in Beauregard, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) east of Montgomery, Smith said.
“We’ve still got people being pulled out of rubble,” Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told Al.com on Sunday evening. “We’re going to be here all night.”
The sheriff and coroner did not immediately return phone messages from The Associated Press.
No deaths had been reported Sunday evening from storm-damaged Alabama counties outside Lee County, said Gregory Robinson, spokesman for the Alabama Emergency Management Agency. But he said crews were still surveying damage in several counties in the southwestern part of the state.
Radar and video evidence showed what looked like a large tornado crossing the area near Beauregard shortly after 2 p.m. Sunday, said meteorologist Meredith Wyatt with the Birmingham, Alabama, office of the National Weather Service.
Numerous tornado warnings were posted across parts of Alabama, Georgia, Florida and South Carolina on Sunday afternoon as the powerful storm system raced across the region.
In rural Talbotton, Georgia, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Atlanta, a handful of people were injured by either powerful straight-line winds or a tornado that destroyed several mobile homes and damaged other buildings, said Leigh Ann Erenheim, director of the Talbot County Emergency Management Agency.
Televised broadcast news footage showed smashed buildings with rooftops blown away, cars overturned and debris everywhere. Trees all around had been snapped bare of branches.
“The last check I had was between six and eight injuries,” Ereheim said in a phone interview. “From what I understand it was minor injuries, though one fellow did say his leg might be broken.”
She said searches of damaged homes and structures had turned up no serious injuries or deaths.
Henry Wilson of the Peach County Emergency Management Agency near Macon in central Georgia said a barn had been destroyed and trees and power poles had been snapped, leaving many in the area without power.
Authorities said a tornado was confirmed by radar in the Florida Panhandle late Sunday afternoon.
A portion of Interstate 10 on the Florida Panhandle was blocked in one direction for a time in Walton County in the aftermath, said Don Harrigan, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.
“There’s a squall line moving through the area,” Harrigan told AP. “And when you have a mature line of storms moving into an area where low level winds are very strong, you tend to have tornadoes developing. It’s a favorable environment for tornados.”
The threat of severe weather was expected to continue into Sunday evening. A tornado watch was in effect for much of eastern Georgia, including Athens, Augusta and Savannah. The tornado watch also covered a large area of South Carolina, including the cities of Charleston and Columbia.

Associated Press,"(BEAUREGARD, Ala.) — Forecasters say 90 people were injured in the tornado that also killed at least 23 people in the small community of Beauregard, Alabama.
The number of injured comes in a Tuesday report from the National Weather Service, forecasters say the tornado’s damage path was nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 kilometers) wide and kept gaining intensity before slamming into Beauregard, Alabama.
Survey crews from the weather service documented how the deadly twister shredded manufactured homes, emptying their contents into the woods.
Forecasters said in the report that the tornado was strong enough to bend the frame of a car around what remained of a large tree. Based on the damage, they’ve determined that it was EF-4 tornado with 170 mph (274 kph) winds.

DAN ELLIOTT and BOB MOEN / AP,"(LONGMONT, Colo.) — National Guard troops used specialized vehicles with tank-like treads to rescue stranded drivers in Colorado in the wake of a massive late-winter storm that unleashed heavy rain and snow on parts of the Midwest plains early Thursday.
South Dakota’s governor closed all state offices Thursday as the blizzard conditions moved in, while wind, blowing snow and snow-packed roadways also made travel treacherous in western Nebraska. Heavy rain caused flooding in eastern parts of both states and in Iowa.
Wednesday’s blizzard in Colorado caused widespread power outages, forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights and wreaked havoc on roadways as drivers became overwhelmed by blinding snow. A wind gust clocked in at 97 mph (156 kph) in Colorado Springs.
The storm also contributed to the death of Corporal Daniel Groves, a Colorado State Patrol officer who was hit and killed by a car as he helped another driver who had slid off Interstate 76 near Denver.
“It is a tragic reminder that people’s lives are at stake,” said Shoshana Lew, head of the Colorado Department of Transportation. “The best place to be is at home and off the roads.”
Lew warned drivers that conditions would remain precarious at least through Thursday.
About 200 vehicles were disabled on Interstate 25 near Colorado Springs, and many more drivers were being rescued on secondary roads, said Kyle Lester with the transportation department’s Division of Highway Maintenance.
One of the stranded drivers was Bria McKenzie, 22, who with her mother, brother and sister, was stuck in her car for more than two hours on a hilly road in Colorado Springs. She said the snow was so blinding and numbing, and the wind was whipping so hard, she didn’t feel safe walking to a hospital that was just down the road.
“It was just like every second you were out there, it felt like parts of you were just freezing,” she said.
McKenzie and her family were eventually rescued by her father in his pickup.
The window-rattling storm brought blizzards, floods and a tornado across more than 25 states Wednesday, stretching from the northern Rocky Mountains to Texas and beyond.
“This is a very epic cyclone,” said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Weather Prediction Center. “We’re looking at something that will go down in the history books.”
Scores of motorists took refuge at truck stops in eastern Wyoming while blowing snow forced portions of major highways to close in Colorado, Nebraska and South Dakota. Meanwhile, hundreds of flights were canceled at Denver International Airport, and nearly 40 were grounded in Colorado Springs.
The wind-whipped storm forced schools and government offices across the state to close for the day and cut power to several hundred thousand homes and businesses. Xcel Energy spokesman Mark Stutz said zero visibility made conditions difficult for repair workers, and it could take days to restore power to everyone.
The culprit was a sudden and severe drop in ground-level air pressure in Colorado, the most pronounced dive since 1950, Carbin said. It was caused by a combination of the jet stream and normal conditions in the wind shadow of the Rockies.
Air rushed into the low-pressure area and then rose into the atmosphere.
“It’s like a vacuum cleaner, really,” Carbin said. When that much air rushes higher into the atmosphere, it causes severe weather.
Meteorologists call the rapid change in pressure a “bomb cyclone” or “bombogenesis.”
Parts of seven states were under blizzard warnings, and 20 states were under some level of high wind alert, Carbin said.
A tornado in New Mexico ripped roofs from buildings in the small town of Dexter, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) southwest of Albuquerque. Authorities said five people were hurt, but none of the injuries was life-threatening. A dairy euthanized about 150 cows injured by the tornado.
Chaves County Sheriff Mike Herrington said the tornado “took out” about 10 homes on one street.
High winds knocked 25 railroad freight cars off a bridge into a mostly dry riverbed near Logan in northeast New Mexico. No one was injured, New Mexico State Police said.

,"At a Glance The chance for severe weather reaches the East Coast on Saturday. Damaging winds and a few tornadoes are possible. The risk for severe thunderstorms will move into the Southeast Saturday, after large hail, damaging wind gusts and tornadoes were reported from Texas to Mississippi Friday into early Saturday. Here is what has happened this evening, followed by the current forecast for the rest of the event: Happening Now A line of strong thunderstorms and heavy rain is moving southeastward through the northern Gulf Coast as of early Saturday. NOAA's Storm Prediction Center has issued a severe thunderstorm watch until 7 a.m. CDT for portions of southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. The watch area included Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Gulfport, Mississippi. Current Radar, Watches and Warnings. As of early Saturday, there have been four reports of tornadoes and numerous reports of damaging wind gusts. Hail up to three inches in diameter was reported near Celina, Texas. (LATEST: Severe Impacts ) More information on reports of severe weather can be found below the forecast section. Setup A low pressure system will move across the Southeast Saturday. Behind this system is an expansive area of arctic air, which will surge into the South. The edge of this cold air, or the cold front, will push southeastward across the southeastern states on Saturday. This will be the focus for scattered severe storms on Saturday. Ahead of this system, moisture is streaming in from the Gulf of Mexico at the surface on southerly winds. Stormy setup for Saturday. In addition, southwesterly winds a few thousand feet above the surface will be supportive of gusty winds at the surface. Timing Below is a closer look at what to expect through Saturday. Saturday Forecast: A broken line of strong to severe thunderstorms will move eastward through northern Florida, central and southern Georiga, coastal South Carolina and perhaps the southern coast of North Carolina during the day into the evening. Threats: The main threat will be damaging wind gusts, but a tornado or two are also possible. Cities: Tallahassee, Florida | Charleston, South Carolina | Savannah, Georgia Saturday's Severe Thunderstorm Forecast In addition to the severe weather, locally heavy rainfall is possible which could lead to some flash flooding. Severe Weather Reports A likely tornado touched down touched down just west of Coushatta, Louisiana, or 40 miles southeast of Shreveport, around 7:35 pm CDT, and the tornado may have been on the ground for 20 to 25 minutes. The tornado may have moved through the town of roughly 1,800 people. Radar indicated that this may have been a significant tornado, and a rare tornado emergency was issued for this storm. So far, widespread tree damage has been reported across Coushatta by law enforcement, but this is a developing story. Another reported tornado touched down northwest of Pelahatchie, Mississippi. Trees and powerlines were downed, according to the National Weather Service. A debris signature was spotted on radar near Ringgold, Louisana Friday evening, which is likely a sign that a tornado touched down in the area, but no damage has been reported. Farther east, a video shows an apparent tornado touching down near Tallulah, Louisiana Friday evening. Also in Louisiana, storms brought quarter to golf ball size hail, including these stones near Shreveport : Severe thunderstorms brought quarter to teacup size hail to parts of the eastern Red River region of northern Texas late Friday afternoon into the early evening. Three-inch hail caused significant damage to vehicles in and around Celina, Texas, located 35 miles north of Dallas. These storms in the northern Dallas metro area did produce possible funnel clouds, but no tornado touchdown is known to have occurred. Another storm produced golf ball size hail near the North Texas Regional Airport near Pottsboro, Texas. Heavy rain across eastern Oklahoma has already brought some flooding to roadways there. Several roads in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma, located south of Tulsa, were closed Friday afternoon due to flooding.","The Weather Channel Threat of Severe Thunderstorms Will Move Into the Southeast on Saturday The Weather Channel The risk for severe thunderstorms will move into the Southeast Saturday, after large hail, damaging wind gusts and tornadoes were reported from Tex…",2018-04-07T10:19:30Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Weather.com'}",Threat of Severe Thunderstorms Will Move Into the Southeast on Saturday - The Weather Channel,https://weather.com/storms/severe/news/2018-04-05-severe-weather-forecast-early-april-severe-wind-tornado,https://s.w-x.co/severe_setup_0407am.jpg,,Weather.com,tornado,1
KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"The remains of a house in Perryville, Mo., after a tornado. Credit Jon Durr/Getty Images Extreme weather events caused a total of $306 billion in damage in the United States last year, making 2017 the most expensive year on record for natural disasters in the country, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. A trio of major hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, contributed hundreds of billions to the total. But the year was seemingly mired in disaster, from a freeze in the Southeast that damaged fruit crops in March, to hail storms that whipped across Colorado, Oklahoma and other central states in May, to the tornadoes that struck the Midwest in June. Unusual consequences of extreme weather could be found all over the map. Thirteen cows died in a field in Pennington County, S.D., after ingesting anthrax spores from the soil; they had changed their grazing patterns during a drought that lasted much of the year in South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana. The cows’ demise was a small part of the $2.5 billion of damage that struck the three states. In all, there were 16 natural disasters that caused more than $1 billion of damage in 2017. In 1980, when NOAA first started tallying records, there were three, adjusted for inflation. Scientists cannot always say with certainty that a given natural disaster was influenced by climate change. But some may be related to warming, and the contiguous United States experienced its third-warmest year on record in 2017. The temperature average was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, said Jake Crouch, a climate scientist from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center. Here are the 16 billion-dollar disasters from 2017: Some made headlines for weeks, and some were simply overtaken in the public’s consciousness by the next one.

Associated Press,"(COLUMBUS, Miss.) — The full extent of the damage was coming into view Sunday after a tornado smashed into a commercial district in a small Mississippi city, killing at least one person and shattering businesses as severe storms raked the South on a weekend of drenching rains and a rising flood threat.
The tornado Saturday afternoon in Columbus was confirmed on radar, said meteorologist Anna Wolverton with the National Weather Service in Jackson. She told The Associated Press that experts would be headed Sunday to the east Mississippi city of about 23,000 people to gauge the tornado’s intensity.
A woman died after a building collapsed on her and three other people, the Columbus mayor’s office said Sunday in a statement on Facebook, citing information from Lowndes County Coroner Greg Merchant. The statement said 41-year-old Ashley Glynell Pounds of Tupelo was with three other people in a building that collapsed in the storm Saturday evening. The statement gave no information on the condition of the other three people.
Lee Lawrence, who said he has been selling used cars for decades in Columbus, told The AP that four buildings on his car lot had been destroyed. He said trees toppled across vehicles and car windows had been blown out. And he said he had no idea about how badly his collection of antique cars fared. A 1923 Studebaker and a 1930 Chevrolet were among the cars parked amid wind-tossed building debris.
Lawrence said he was at home getting ready to take a bath when the storm struck.
“The wind all of a sudden just got so strong and it was raining so much you could hardly see out the door, and I could hear a roaring. Evidently it came close,” he said, speaking with AP in a phone interview. He said someone called him soon after about the damage to his business and he rushed over.
“It will be a start-over deal,” Lawrence said. “I can’t say it will come back better or stronger, but we’ll come back.”
A photographer working for The AP in Columbus said some antique cars on Lawrence’s lot were parked among the damage and a nearby pet grooming business appeared now to be mostly twisted piles of metal. A printing shop had been speared by a pipe with great force and what seemed to be a vacant commercial building nearby appeared heavily damaged.
Firefighters and law enforcement officers had cordoned off the area, making it difficult to determine the extent of damage after nightfall. Power was out in the area.
Elsewhere around the South, homes, highways, parks and bridges were flooded or put out of commission amid the heavy rains and severe storms. News outlets report that water rescues have been performed in some Middle Tennessee counties. Flash flood warnings and watches remained in place throughout the South and one Mississippi community reported large hail.
Interstate 40 near the Tennessee line with North Carolina was closed by a rockslide, one of the dozens of roads and highways shut down throughout the region, transportation officials said.
Tennessee Department of Transportation spokesman Mark Nagi said on Twitter that a “full scale detour” was in place, with traffic being diverted to Interstate 81 and Interstate 26.
High water threatened property in Tennessee, which, like many other areas of the South, has been soaked by several inches of rain over the past week. Officials said a mudslide destroyed a Subway restaurant in Signal Mountain, Tennessee. No injuries were reported.
In Bruce, Mississippi, rivers broke flood stage and flash floods poured into homes and businesses. News outlets report that officials in Grenada, Mississippi, declared a local state of emergency after dozens of streets and homes flooded. A 6-mile (9-kilometer) stretch of the Natchez Trace Parkway was closed in Mississippi after water covered part of the road.
The National Weather Service had issued a flash flood warning for northwestern Lafayette County in Mississippi after emergency officials reported that a local dam was at risk of failing. Meteorologist Kole Fehling says emergency officials reported the threat involved the Audubon Dam, which blocks a creek on the north side of Oxford and a subdivision.
Weather officials said the storm’s impact stretched from eastern Arkansas to northern Georgia and beyond. Alabama’s governor declared a state of emergency in several counties, hoping to speed recovery in event of damages.
Kentucky announced Friday that it was closing the U.S. 51 bridge over the Ohio River to Cairo, Illinois, because of flooding on the southern approach. The bridge, which carries 4,700 vehicles a day, is likely to stay closed until Thursday, and possibly longer.
Near Jamestown, Kentucky, the Army Corps of Engineers said it was increasing releases from the Wolf Creek Dam on the Cumberland River. Areas downstream of the dam, from Rowena to Burkesville, could be affected by flooding as a result, officials said.
The Ohio River at Cairo is predicted to crest Sunday at its third-highest level ever recorded, and stay that high into next week. The Tennessee River near Savannah, Tennessee, also is forecast to crest at near-record levels.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Waterways across the Carolinas and beyond swelled to record-breaking levels this week, with several rising more than 20 feet above their averages, according to National Weather Service data. The Cape Fear and Lumber Rivers were forecast to rise as high or even higher than they did during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, North Carolina officials said. Christian Dreyer has seen this kind of flooding before, and he knows that the worst is yet to come. As a volunteer member of a New Jersey search-and-rescue team, he helped pull people from rushing floodwaters in this part of North Carolina after Hurricane Matthew. Now he’s back with the same group, New Jersey Task Force 1, helping rescue people from their flooded homes in Washington, N.C., just north of New Bern. The crew got some people out in vehicles, but in other cases, they had to drive boats up to their front doors. The flooding right now is caused mostly by storm surge, as the swollen ocean pushes rivers over their banks. It’s slow moving, Mr. Dreyer said, especially compared to the rushing floodwaters that will soon come from the opposite direction, down the rivers, as up to 40 inches of rain falls inland. “A surge is like a bathtub flooding,” said Mr. Dreyer, who is also a sergeant first class with the New Jersey State Police, as tornado warnings went off in the background. “When it comes down from the mountains, it’s all gravity. It’s going to be much faster and more dangerous.” Several deaths have been reported Continue reading the main story","Fierce rains were likely to produce “catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding,” the National Hurricane Center said.",2018-09-15T09:45:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Hurricane Florence Live Updates: Heavy Rains Drenching the Carolinas,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/us/hurricane-florence-path.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/us/hurricane-florence-tracking-map-promo-1536673849664/hurricane-florence-tracking-map-promo-1536673849664-facebookJumbo-v33.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tornado,1

Gina Martinez,"A Wyoming resident captured some amazing images of a tornado touching down in the plains Wednesday. The National Weather Service office in Cheyenne tweeted out a warning to residents asking them to take shelter. “Tornado north of Laramie is still on the ground. As picturesque as it may look, we ask that you take shelter now. No picture is worth getting hurt.” the tweet read. But that’s didn’t stop Aaron Voos from shooting breathtaking photos of the tornado on his phone, a Kyocera E6810 Duraforce Pro, as he was driving home. “I am not normally a storm chaser,” Voos told TIME. “We live 7,200 feet over sea level so tornados are very rare. We see a lot of storms and lightning but never a tornado like that, thats for sure. Hopefully it’s the first and the last.” The tornado touched down near Laramie, Wyoming just before 5 p.m. and was on the ground for 45 minutes, according to the National Weather Service. Voos said the storm was far enough from his house that his wife and older son were able to leave instead of hunkering down. He said most neighbors did the same. Despite the warning, the National Weather Service in Cheyenne posted several pictures and videos from resident who captured shots of the twister. According to the Albany County Sheriffs Office, the tornado caused minimal damage to some structures, power poles, power lines, and fencing.

At least 11 tornadoes were reported in Virginia on Monday afternoon, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center. All tornado warnings expired at 5:45 p.m., but a tornado watch remains posted for parts of central Maryland, eastern Virginia and the District of Columbia until 10 p.m. The NWS office in Wakefield, Virginia, said it plans to send crews out beginning Tuesday to survey the damage and determine how many tornadoes touched down and their ratings on the Enhanced Fujita scale. The remnants of Florence are interacting with a warm, humid airmass in place over the mid-Atlantic states, weather.com meteorologist Brian Donegan said. Wind shear – the change in wind speed and/or direction with height – is high across the region, leading to the development of multiple tornadoes Monday afternoon.

Nicole Einbinder,"The Poarch Band of Creek Indians, the only federally recognized tribe in Alabama, hand delivered a $184,000 check on Wednesday to fund the funeral costs of the 23 victims killed by a deadly tornado that tore through Lee County, Alabama earlier this month. 
 ""I am beyond grateful that the Poarch Band of Creek Indians stepped up and offered this generous donation,"" Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told INSIDER. ""They reached out and asked what could they do to help and it was suggested to help with the funeral costs and they graciously offered to cover all the costs."" 
 Haris said the donated money will be spent through the East Alabama Medical Center Foundation.

 The tornado — the deadliest to hit the US in nearly six years — had winds estimated at 170 mph and left a path of destruction nearly a mile wide and 24 miles long, the National Weather Service reported. Harris said during a news conference after the storm that victims ranged in age from 6 to 89, with one family losing 10 members. Four of the family's children were aged 6, 8, 9, and 10.

At first, there were two anonymous corporations that had agreed to pay for the funeral costs. While the Native American tribe initially committed $50,000, they later stepped up to cover all funeral and burial expenses after the other donor backed out of the arrangement. 
 In addition to the tribe, former NFL Super Bowl champion DeMarcus Ware also donated $10,000 for grave markers, Harris confirmed to INSIDER.

Cecilia D'Anastasio,"Last night, as a tornado ravaged Greensboro, North Carolina, a local teen was just staying put trying to survive the storm in Fortnite Battle Royale, he told local news station WXII 12. The 135 mile-per-hour tornado, which prompted a state of emergency, did significant damage to Greensboro homes and has claimed one life. Tens of thousands lost power as the tornado uprooted houses, mobile homes and trees. In an interview with the local news network, teen Anton Williams stands in front of an overturned van near his home. The reporter explains that the house behind them had been lifted off its foundation, adding that Anton’s house had lost siding and was pierced by a power line. The reporter asks Anton what he was doing during the storm. He responds, “I was sitting at home and I was playing Fortnite and all the sudden I just heard a bunch of noise. I looked out the window and I started seeing the roofs come off the houses in front of me. Then I sat back down because I only had a couple of people left in my game. I was going to try to finish the game.” The storm intensified, Anton continued, and the power lines came down. A truck flipped over. He herded his sister and nephew into the bathroom to keep them safe. “What was going through your mind when you were in the bathroom with your sister and nephew?” asked the reporter. “Honestly,” Anton responds, “I was just thinking about the game,” adding, “I was hoping everybody was okay around me.” It’s a well-documented fact the the teens love Fortnite. It’s destroying classrooms nationwide. Teachers are using it to make school suck less. Of course a kid was playing it during a deadly tornado. Actually, on /r/FortniteBR, where fans posted a phone recording of WXII 12’s clip, a half dozen other Greensboro, NC locals piped up to say they, too, were surviving two storms at once. Anton didn’t win his Fortnite game, but IRL, his strategy is winning: Stay safe from the storm and protect your squad.","Last night, as a tornado ravaged Greensboro, North Carolina, a local teen was just staying put trying to survive the storm in Fortnite Battle Royale, he told local news station WXII 12.

Mark Kaufman,"Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast. They're escaping the smoke. Davis, California, sits amid a layer of wildfire smoke in Northern California. To the northwest, the largest fire in state history, the Mendocino Complex Fire, continues to burn. To the southeast, the Ferguson Fire has closed down smoke-choked Yosemite National Park indefinitely. And to the North, the Carr Fire, infamous for its towering fire tornado, still burns. SEE ALSO: California just had its hottest month on record, and that means more wildfires The air quality in the region around the fires — whose spread has been enhanced by extreme heat parching the land — is some of the worst in the world. ""I decided to go out to the coast for a couple days because it was so ridiculous,"" Wexler said. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service illustrated how winds have lifted bounties of smoke across the entire U.S., bringing pollution even beyond the East Coast. Smoke from the western fires is making it all the way to the East Coast and beyond (at least aloft—mostly above a mile above the surface). Here's the vertically integrated smoke (HRRR model from last night). Another map showed some smoke near the surface even in New England. pic.twitter.com/0Jl6WDAFjg — NWS San Diego (@NWSSanDiego) August 8, 2018 That said, it's not as if these smoke particles are harmful to those on the East Coast. By the time that smoke arrives in Boston and New York, the particles have been diluted with fresh air, and certainly can't be seen, nor are concentrations unhealthy. It's normal for pollution to waft from west to east across the country, just like pollution from China is regularly transported over the Pacific Ocean into the U.S. That's how air generally moves over the Northern Hemisphere, said Wexler. But it's much rarer for even low concentrations of smoke to find their way across the nation. ""It doesn’t happen every day,"" Gabriele Pfister, deputy director of the National Center of Atmospheric Research’s atmospheric chemistry lab, said in an interview. ""But, it can happen."" ""Normally, the pollution isn’t so great that it’s noticeable when it gets east,"" added Wexler. But just how bad is the air pollution in large regions of the West? ""It's been like a reasonably decent day in Beijing,"" said Wexler. ""That's really telling. It’s really awful there."" ""It’s unbelievable,"" said Pfister. She noted that planes flying over the area, as part of a National Science Foundation-funded wildfire study, have picked up some alarming pollution numbers. It's expected that particulate matter — tiny fragments of pollution 30 times thinner than a human hair — would be bad. But the flights even picked up abnormally high concentrations of carbon monoxide, an odorless gas that can be dangerous to human health in enclosed spaces, and at worse, lethal. However, some of the measured values around the fires are about 5 parts per million, or ppm, which are not considered nearly dangerous — but it's still telling. ""These are values you don’t typically find near the surface in the U.S.,"" said Pfister. ""Maybe you’ll find that if you stick your head into the exhaust of a car."" It's not carbon monoxide, however, that people in burning regions need to be concerned about. One of the main factors that's figured into air quality ratings is particulate matter. Both U.S. government and university researchers have repeatedly shown that breathing this stuff is bad for your heart, as it accelerates plaque build-up in blood vessels. In some areas of Oregon, the Air Quality Index currently registers as ""Hazardous."" In Redding, California, where a fire tornado spun for 80 minutes last week, the air quality is rated as ""Unhealthy."" But out near the windswept coast, like in San Francisco, the air quality is ""Good."" It's likely that the West will be intermittently blanketed in unhealthy to hazardous air for months ahead, as the fire season is not nearly over. Rains aren't expected for months, and more temperature and fire records might be broken. Many Westerners aren't near the fires themselves. But it's harder to outrun the smoke. ""In my experience, it's never been this bad,"" said Wexler.","Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast.

Xeni Jardin,"Recent tornado killed 23 in tiny town on Alabama-Georgia border, including 4 children, and 7 people from one family.
In Alabama, authorities confirm that The Poarch Band of Creek Indians donated $180,000 to cover all costs for funeral services and interment for the 23 people killed in Sundays tornado in Lee County.
The county coroner announced this news on Thursday.
From AL.com:
The coroners office received word that they wanted to help and reached out to them and they agreed. Their first commitment was for $50,000. Later they called back and ask me what it would take to cover the costs and I gave them a figure and they graciously made it happen, said Lee County Coroner Bill Harris. The monies will be deposited with the East Alabama Medical Center Foundation to be dispersed to the funeral homes to cover the cost of the funerals. I am so thankful for them to step up in this manner and help the families of this tragedy.
In Alabama, search and rescue teams were still combing through the wreckage of houses flatted by weekend tornadoes this week. On Tuesday, they were looking for seven or eight people still unaccounted for in the wake of the deadliest U.S. tornado outbreak since 2013.
The tiny community of Beauregard, near the Alabama-Georgia border, was beginning to mourn the 23 people confirmed killed by the storms, which included four children and seven people from one family, officials said on Tuesday.
Most of the people who died were found near their homes. The four children were age 6, 8, 9 and 10, said officials.
It looks like that's the community being addressed by today's announcement. Such terrible loss.
About the economic power of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, from the tribal website:
The Poarch Band of Creek Indians is the only federally recognized Indian Tribe in the state of Alabama, operating as a sovereign nation with its own system of government and bylaws. The Tribe operates a variety of economic enterprises, which employ hundreds of area residents.

AP,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) The youngest victim was 6, the oldest 89. Relatives said one extended family lost 10 members.
The 23 people killed in the nations deadliest tornado in nearly six years came into focus Tuesday with the release of their names by the coroner.
They included 6-year-old Armando Hernandez Jr., known as AJ, torn from his fathers arms two days after singing in his first-grade class musical; 10-year-old Taylor Thornton, who loved horses and was visiting a friends home when the twister struck; and Jimmy Lee Jones, 89, who perished along with his wife of six decades, Mary Louise, and one of their sons.
Just keep those families in your prayers, Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said, two days after the disaster.
The search for victims, pets and belongings in and around the devastated rural community of Beauregard continued amid the din of beeping heavy machinery and whining chain saws. But Sheriff Jay Jones said the list of the missing had shrunk from dozens to just seven or eight.
Weve got piles of rubble that we are searching just to make sure, said Opelika Fire Chief Byron Prather Jr. We dont think well find nobody there, but we dont want to leave any stone unturned.
Four children were killed, ages 6, 8, 9 and 10.
The youngest, AJ, had taken shelter in a closet with his father and older brother when the tornado hit, said Jack Crisp, the boys uncle. The punishing winds tore the familys home apart, Crisp said, and pulled both boys from their fathers arms.
He had them squeezed tight, and he said when it came through, it just took them, Crisp said. It just demolished the house and took them.
The boys father and brother both survived. AJ did not.
Jackie Jones said she and her siblings rushed to her parents house after the storm passed and nobody answered the phone. They usually answer on the first ring, she said.
The siblings found the home reduced to its foundation. One of their two brothers who lived at the house survived and was taken to a hospital. But Jimmy Lee and Mary Louise Jones, married for more than 60 years, had died along with their 53-year-old son Emmanuel.
Those three deaths meant cousins Cordarrly and Demetria Jones lost their grandparents and an uncle. They said seven others killed were their cousins by blood and marriage.
Everybody in this area just about was related, said Demetria Jones, 28. Its devastating.
The body of David Wayne Dean, 53, was found by his son in a neighbors yard after the twister demolished his mobile home. He was known as Roaddog because of his love for Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
He was done and gone before we got to him, said his sobbing widow, Carol Dean, who was at work at Walmart when the storm hit. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.
The tornado was an EF4 with winds estimated at 170 mph (274 kph) and carved a path of destruction up to nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 kilometers) wide in Alabama, scraping up the earth in a phenomenon known as ground rowing, the National Weather Service said. It traveled a remarkable 70 miles or so through Alabama and Georgia, where it caused more damage.
Ninety people were injured in the Beauregard area, authorities said. Most have been released from the hospital.
President Donald Trump said he will visit Alabama on Friday to see the damage. Its been a tragic situation, but a lot of good work is being done, he said at the White House.
Along the two-lane country road where some of the victims died, firefighters used heavy machinery to overturn pieces of houses that were blown into a gulley. A car sat atop the remains of one house. A red-brick foundation was all that was left at another lot.
The search took its toll around Beauregard, an unincorporated area of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia line. Church chaplain Ike Mathews walked down a road lined with broken trees and debris as he went to check on members of his congregation and emergency workers.
Yesterday I talked to some team members who had found bodies. Theyre hurting. The community is torn up. They started crying talking about it, said Mathews, an associate pastor at Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church.
Many of the people living in the area are senior citizens who moved to the country after retiring from textile mills or an old magnetic-tape manufacturing plant that closed years ago, Mathews said.
They start with a mobile home and hope they can build a house someday. They invest in their homes, and they have a sense of legacy. Its something to leave their kids and grandkids, he said.
It was the deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
Government teams surveying storm damage confirmed that at least 20 tornadoes struck on Sunday in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.
Cindy Sanford said one of her neighbors in Beauregard died in the storm, and another neighbor remained missing Tuesday.
I pray to God that they find her, Sanford said as picked through remains of her home, which tumbled in the wind and is now scattered across neighbors land.
Sanford said she left home with her 5-year-old grandson about five minutes before the storm struck after she got a feeling it was unsafe.
It was God, she said. And then I heard the siren.

Reuters,"A Eurofighter Typhoon and a Dassault Rafale at the ILA Air Show in Berlin. Thomson Reuters BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is pressing Washington to clarify whether it would let the Eurofighter Typhoon carry nuclear bombs as part of shared Western defenses, an issue that could help decide whether Berlin orders more of the jets, sources familiar with the matter said. Although not a nuclear power, Germany hosts some US nuclear warheads under NATO's nuclear-sharing policy and operates a number of Tornado warplanes that can deliver them. New jets will need to be certified by Washington to carry out nuclear missions, a process which can take years. Germany's defense ministry sent a letter to the US Defense Department in April asking whether certification of the European jets was possible, how much it would cost, and how long it would take, the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Top US Air Force and Pentagon officials are working to respond to the German query, the sources said. The multi-billion-euro tender to replace Germany's fleet of 89 Tornados, which are due to retire in the middle of the next decade, pits the Typhoon against several US contenders at a time of strains in transatlantic ties. A German air force Eurofighter Typhoon takes off at Amari air base, Estonia, March 2, 2017. Thomson Reuters Executives with Airbus, Lockheed Martin and Boeing are making presentations to the defense ministry this week after submitting reams of information on their respective warplanes in April, with the formal launch of the competition expected later this year, industry sources said. The German defense ministry declined comment on the issue. No comment was immediately available from the Pentagon. Lockheed's radar-evading F-35 fighter is already slated to have the nuclear capability in the early 2020s, while the Eurofighter would still need certification. Airbus has said it is confident Eurofighter — a joint project with Britain's BAE Systems and Italy's Leonardo — could be certified by 2025. Sources familiar with the Eurofighter said it was possible to reconfigure the European jet to carry nuclear bombs. A German air force Eurofighter Typhoon taxis toward the runway at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska before departing for a combat-training mission, June 11, 2012. Tech Sgt. Michael Holzworth But US government sources say that schedule is ambitious given that the F-35 and other aircraft must be certified first. Washington has suggested it could take seven to 10 years to certify the Eurofighter for nuclear missions, well beyond the Tornado's retirement date, according to one German military source. While urging Europe to boost defense spending, US officials are worried about being shut out of European defense projects after 25 EU governments signed a pact in December to fund, develop and deploy armed forces together. US officials will also weigh whether the Eurofighter could survive a mission into enemy territory to drop a nuclear bomb without stealth capability at a time when Russia and other potential future enemies have bolstered their sensors and air defenses, a second source said. The F-35 is the only aircraft in the running that has such radar-evading capabilities, but Boeing and Eurofighter argue that their aircraft can work in tandem with jamming equipment. Volker Paltzo, chief executive of Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH, told Reuters this week that he remained confident that Eurofighter could take over the roles of the Tornado, and the company had a strategy to deal with a length certification process. He said the Tornado had been successfully recertified several times after major upgrades.

Mark Kaufman,"For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history. Tuesday morning, the Golden State's fire protection agency, Cal Fire, reported that the Mendocino Complex fire had now burned over 290,000 acres — over nine times the size of San Francisco — surpassing the previous record of 281,893 set in December by the destructive Thomas Fire. SEE ALSO: A NASA prototype could save the lives of firefighters as blazes erupt in western U.S. The Mendocino Complex, which is comprised of two massive fires whose edges are as close as three miles apart, is not nearly finished. The larger of the two fires, at some 240,000 acres, is just 20 percent contained. Other major wildfires are also burning across the state, including the 94,000-acre Ferguson Fire which has closed down Yosemite National Park indefinitely, and the 167,000-acre Carr Fire — the twelfth largest in state history — which last week produced a towering fire tornado. Though climate change itself, specifically extreme and recording-breaking heat, doesn't create fires, it enhances them. As fire experts pointed out earlier in the season, hot temperatures and heat waves have parched much of Northern California's vegetation to near-record levels of dryness — turning the land to fire-ready kindling. California's large-scale fires are creating seriously polluted air over vast portions of the West. As climatologist Robert Rohde noted on Twitter Monday, ""the worst particulate air pollution anywhere in the world that we have data is in southern #Oregon due to the smoke from the #wildfires."" This is a growing, and troubling, trend. As air quality continues to improve around most of the U.S., wildfires are tainting the air across a large swathe of the West. The reason is simple. Twice as much U.S. land burns today than in the 1980s, filling the air with more tiny bits of particulate matter. Since 2000, California has seen seven of its top 10 largest-ever recorded fires.

Associated Press,"(BEAUREGARD, Ala.) — The youngest victim was 6, the oldest 93. One family lost seven members.
The 23 people killed in the nation’s deadliest tornado in nearly six years came into focus Tuesday when the coroner finished identifying them and released their names.
“Just keep those families in your prayers,” Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said, two days after the disaster. “It’s a tragic situation.”
The search for victims in and around the devastated rural community of Beauregard continued, with crews using heavy equipment to lift large chunks of wreckage. But Sheriff Jay Jones said the list of missing people had shrunk from dozens to just seven or eight.
“We are still conducting some searches, sifting through piles of debris where there may be people or animals,” said Opelika Fire Chief Byron Prather. “We haven’t given up hope.”
The dead included 53-year-old David Wayne Dean, whose body was found in a neighbor’s yard after the twister demolished his mobile home Sunday afternoon. He was known as “Roaddog” for his love of Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
“Our son found him,” his widow, Carol Dean, said between sobs. “He was done and gone before we got to him. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.”
After the tornado passed, she rushed home from work at Walmart and pushed past sheriff’s deputies to be with husband one last time. Picking through the ruins of their home, she found her wedding dress and a Father’s Day note to her husband that read, “Daddy, I love you to pieces.”
The tornado was an EF4 packing winds estimated at 170 mph (274 kph) and chewed a path of destruction up to nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 kilometers) wide in Alabama for nearly 27 miles (43 kilometers), the National Weather Service said. Ninety people were injured, it said.
Around Beauregard, an unincorporated area of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia state line, mobile homes tucked among tall pine trees were swept from their bases and smashed into unrecognizable piles of rubble. Toys, clothes, insulation, water heaters and pieces of metal were scattered across the hillsides where the pines were snapped in half.
Law enforcement teams searching for victims used dogs and heat-detecting drones.
It was the deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
Government teams surveying storm damage confirmed Tuesday that at least 18 tornadoes struck on Sunday in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina alone.

Trump says he has talked to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and promised that the Federal Emergency Management Agency will help with recovery efforts and that “whatever we can do, we’re doing.”
The Sunday tornado was part of a powerful storm system that also slashed its way across parts of Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.

MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN and ANDREA RODRIGUEZ / AP,"(HAVANA) — A tornado and pounding rains smashed into the eastern part of Cuba’s capital overnight, toppling trees, bending power poles and flinging shards of metal roofing through the air as the storm cut a path of destruction across eastern Havana.
Power was cut to many areas and President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Monday at least three people were killed and 172 injured.
Julio Menendez, a 33-year-old restaurant worker, said his neighborhood in Havana’s 10 de Octubre municipality looked “like a horror movie.”
“From one moment to the next, we heard a noise like an airplane falling out of the sky. The first thing I did was go hug my daughters,” who are 9 and 12, he told The Associated Press.
Driver Oster Rodriguez said that amid a fierce storm, what looked like a thick, swirling cloud touched down in the central plaza of the Reparto Modelo neighborhood “like a fireball.” He saw a bus blown over, though he said the driver escaped unharmed.
Miguel Angel Hernandez of the Cuban Center for Meteorology said the tornado was a Category F3, with winds between 155 and 199 miles per hour, produced when a cold front hit Cuba’s northern coast.
Members of the Provincial Defense Council of Havana said 90 homes collapsed completely and 30 suffered partial collapse.
More than 200,000 people lost water service, largely because of power cuts that left pumps out of service. Some 100 underground cisterns close to the coastal section of Havana were contaminated by seawater.
Three electric substations were knocked out by the tornado, the strongest to hit Cuba since Dec. 26, 1940, when a Category F4 tornado hit the town of Bejucal, in what is now Mayabeque province.
The windows in the seven-story Daughters of Galicia Hospital in 10 de Octubre section were sucked out of their frames by the wind, leaving curtains flapping in the breeze, and all the patients, new and expectant mothers, had to be evacuated. In the streets, a palm tree more than 30 feet (9 meters) tall had crushed a pre-revolutionary American car.
Some of the heaviest damage from Sunday night’s rare Havana tornado was in the eastern borough of Guanabacoa, where the apparent twister tore the roof off a shelter for dozens of homeless families.
Cubans enduring long waits for government housing often live in such multifamily shelters for years.
María Esther Linares, 54, was killed while hunting for safe shelter after the tornado broke the roof of the home where she was living with two granddaughters, said her grandson, Yoelkis Dip.
Dianabys Bueno, 31, was living in the shelter with her husband and son after they were forced to relocate by the collapse of their home in Central Havana. Much of the housing in Havana is in dire condition due to years without maintenance, and building collapses are routine even in ordinary storms.
“This has already happened to us once,” Bueno said. “I’m not going anywhere.”
Around Havana, cars were crushed by fallen light posts and vehicles were trapped in floodwaters. The neighborhoods of Regla and 10 de Octubre appeared to have suffered some of the worst damage.
State media said the city had been hit by winds in excess of 60 mph (100 kph).
Leanys Calvo, a restaurant cook in the 10th de Octubre borough, said she was working Sunday night despite heavy rain and wind when she heard a rumbling noise outside and looked out to see what appeared to be a tornado touching down.
“It was something that touched down, and then took off again. It was like a tower,” she said, describing it as displaying colors of red and green. “It was here for two-three seconds, nothing more. They were the most frightening seconds of my life.”
The tornado tore the concrete roof off an apartment building in the Regla section of Havana and dumped it into an alleyway, briefly trapping residents in their homes.
Marlene Marrero Garcia, 77, said she was in her ground-floor apartment with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren Sunday night when she heard electrical transformers begin to explode. Then the tornado passed.
“It looked like fire, everything was red, then everything began to fall,” she said.
Marrero said she and her family were trapped by debris for about half an hour before firefighters arrived.
She and other residents said two of their neighbors had been hospitalized.

Stunned residents of a small Mississippi city were picking up the pieces Sunday after a violent tornado ripped through town, leaving one person dead and marking the first tornado death of 2019. 
The tornado in Columbus, which was triggered by a line of intense thunderstorms on Saturday evening, was confirmed by the National Weather Service in Jackson.  The twister, part of a severe weather outbreak that battered the South, toppled trees and shattered businesses and homes in the city of 24,000 on the eastern border of the state. 
Ashley Glynell Pounds, 41, of Tupelo died after a building collapsed on her and three other people, the office of Columbus Mayor Robert Smith confirmed in a Facebook post. Smith said 12 other people were injured.
Pounds' death was the first tornado death of 2019, according to the Weather Channel. 
Your @MSEMA team has been working with local first responders during these storms. So far one fatality has been confirmed and damage assessments are now underway. We are saddened by the loss of life but thankful it was not much worse. We are grateful this Sunday morning. https://t.co/9xIBRqplB4

Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said Sunday in a tweet that state emergency officials were working with first responders. ""So far one fatality has been confirmed and damage assessments are now underway. We are saddened by the loss of life but thankful it was not much worse. We are grateful this Sunday morning,"" he said.
The tornado seriously damaged a school, two community center buildings and other warehouses and businesses, city spokesman Joe Dillon said.  
More: Wild weather weekend: Blizzard, tornadoes, floods, ferocious winds all expected
Pastor Steve Blaylock of the city's First Pentecostal Church hugged his wife, Pat, on Sunday amid the broken lumber, destroyed pews and sheared-off roof that was once his church. 
The building was a total loss, Blaylock said. But he said the church would still hold a Sunday prayer service and a scheduled baptism, using a borrowed portable baptismal pool.
We will rebuild. Weve got a good church here, Blaylock said. It will be a testimony of God.
Residents described a harrowing rainstorm and powerful winds Saturday evening.  
The wind all of a sudden just got so strong and it was raining so much you could hardly see out the door, and I could hear a roaring. Evidently it came close, Lee Lawrence told the Associated Press. Lawrence said four buildings on his used car lot were destroyed, car windows were blown out and uprooted trees were flung across vehicles.

Dax Clark, a meteorology student at Mississippi State University, told The Weather Channel he and some classmates took refuge at a gas station.
""We knew from the radar on our phones that the tornado was moving north of us, but the wind was still crazy,"" Clark said. ""It did not hit our gas station directly but it was still pretty substantial.""
More: 2018 was an all-time record quiet year for tornadoes in the U.S.
Clark witnessed a trail of destruction after the storm roared through. ""We saw homes without roofs and outer walls, a car flipped over into a ditch, and lots of trees and power lines down,"" he said.
Elsewhere, a man died after his vehicle became submerged in high water fueled by heavy rains in Knoxville, Tennessee. Officials in some eastern Kentucky counties also declared emergencies because of  flooding and mudslides.

Bill Chappell,"Everyone who had been reported missing after violent tornadoes struck eastern Alabama Sunday is now accounted for and authorities said Wednesday that they don't expect the death toll of 23 people to change. The mission is now about recovery, Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said.
There had been fears that the toll might rise by as many as seven or eight people but in a midday briefing, Jones said, ""I'm very pleased to announce... we are now confident we have accounted for all of the individuals."" 
Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said it's unlikely there are any further victims. There had been confusion in one case, he said, in which a man was entered into a hospital under the wrong name. 
As residents cope with the damage and loss from the weekend's storm, the National Weather Service is warning more tornadoes may be on the way, according to member station WBHM's Miranda Fulmore.
""The bigger focus now starts to shift to Saturday, especially Saturday evening,"" said the NWS's Kevin Laws, in a report Fulmore filed for NPR. ""We have another storm system very powerful that will be entering the state.""
Alabama was hit by at least 11 tornadoes during last weekend's storm, Laws said, adding that his agency's assessments are nearly complete. The worst was the Beauregard-Smiths Station tornado that was rated at EF-4. That tornado's winds reached 170 mph as it traveled 70 miles into Georgia, Laws said. 
On Tuesday, President Trump approved Gov. Kay Ivey's request for an expedited major disaster declaration for Lee County, Alabama Emergency Management Agency Director Brian Hastings said. 
As part of the recovery process, disaster assistance crews will spend Wednesday traveling through affected communities, attempting to sign up anyone who needs financial help.
Ivey is scheduled to inspect the tornado damage today, with Trump slated to visit on Friday.
On Tuesday, two corporations volunteered to pay for ""most, if not all, of the funeral expenses"" for all 23 tornado victims, Harris said. But as of Wednesday, more offers have come in, including a $50,000 commitment from the Poarch Band of Creek Indians.","""I'm very pleased to announce... we are now confident we have accounted for all of the individuals,"" Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said, easing fears of a higher total.",2019-03-06T19:35:46Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Alabama's Tornado Death Toll Of 23 Is Final, Lee County Sheriff Says",https://www.npr.org/2019/03/06/700822839/alabamas-tornado-death-toll-of-23-is-final-sheriff-says,https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,tornado,1

Jennifer Earl,"Motorists unexpectedly drove straight into the path of a raging tornado in Germany last week — and the terrifying incident was captured on video. A video that has been circulating online shows two cars driving down a tree-lined road in Schwalmtal, Germany, when suddenly a tornado appears. Trees are nearly blown over by the powerful winds, which kick up dirt and other debris. The vehicles parked just ahead of the tornado, which slowly inched closer. The tornado then ""swallowed"" the cars with darkness. Meteorologist Anton Seimon told National Geographic the tornado was likely winding down by the time the motorists reached it, estimating winds were about 74 miles per hour at the time. The drivers did the right thing by slowing down and keeping their distance, he added. If you find yourself trapped by a tornado at its highest intensity, however, Seimon recommends ditching the car and finding a safe space. 'TORNADO ALLEY' AND OTHER THINGS TO KNOW DURING TORNADO SEASON “Abandoning the vehicle and lying face down in the lowest place possible, such as a drainage ditch, is [recommended] over trying to ride out the tornado within the vehicle,” Seimon told the publication, explaining that tornadoes can be powerful enough to pick up vehicles. A tornado is a column of “rapidly rotating air that comes from a powerful, towering thunderstorm” also known as a supercell, Janice Dean, Fox News’ Senior Meteorologist, explained ahead of tornado season. Tornadoes are often unpredictable. While tornadoes are ""spawned by strong thunderstorms, not all strong thunderstorms end up predicting tornadoes,"" Dean said. The tornado hit several towns in western Germany last Wednesday, injuring at least two people and damaging several homes, Reuters reported.

REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer BERLIN (Reuters) - NATO member Germany's air force is in dire straits and funds are urgently needed to modernize its weaponry and systems, the air force chief of staff said on Wednesday. ""The Luftwaffe is at a low point,"" Lieutenant General Ingo Gerhartz, who took over as chief of staff of the air force about a month ago, told 200 industry executives, military officers and lawmakers at an event in Berlin on Wednesday evening. Gerhartz said his assessment followed visits to various air force sites and discussions with troops that revealed serious deficits in the readiness of aircraft and other equipment. ""Aircraft are grounded due to a lack of spare parts, or they aren't even on site since they're off for maintenance by the industry,"" he said. He said a 400-hour inspection of the Eurofighter combat jets now took a total of 14 months, twice as long as planned, and this was unacceptable. His comments followed recent reports by the defense ministry and the German parliament's military ombudsman that revealed significant gaps in military equipment and personnel.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) are finalizing budget plans for 2019, but Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, from the SPD, has been resisting moves to accelerate increases in military spending. Merkel this month forecast steady increases in German military spending in coming years, in line with Berlin's pledge to meet a NATO target of moving toward spending 2% of economic output by 2024, but she gave no details. Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen has been pressing for increased spending after Scholz's previous longer-term plan called for military outlays to edge lower after reaching 1.3% of economic output in 2019, up from 1.2% now. Von der Leyen has pledged that German military spending will reach 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2025. Gerhartz urged lawmakers at the Wednesday event to back a more sustainable spending plan that would allow the air force to rebuild its equipment and improve planning for new weapons and upgrades to existing systems.

"USA TODAY, Jorge L. Ortiz, USA TODAY","The death toll is expected to rise as authorities continue recovery efforts in Lee County, Alabama, after the deadliest tornado outbreak in years.
 USA TODAY
The tornado that devastated rural parts of eastern Alabama on Sunday left behind a deathly trail, compared by one observer to a giant knife scraping the ground.
Early reports put the number of casualties at 23, but that figure could rise as rescuers search amid the destroyed homes for victims.
The town of Beauregard, an unincorporated community of about 10,000 in Lee County, took a major hit from the twister, whose winds were estimated at 160 mph.
All we could do is just hold on for life and pray, said Jonathan Clardy, who huddled with his family inside their Beauregard trailer as the tornado ripped the roof off. Its a blessing from God that me and my youngns are alive.
Identities of the victims are starting to emerge.
Taylor Thornton
The Lee-Scott Academy, a Christian school in Auburn, Ala., reported on its Facebook page the passing of its fourth-grade student, saying Taylor was welcomed into the arms of Jesus as the result of the severe weather event in Lee County yesterday.
Our hearts at Lee-Scott Academy are broken this morning. Please pray for the Thornton family, our students, faculty, and staff during this difficult time.
The posting mentions that a GoFundMe page has been established on behalf of Taylors family. The page, which had already surpassed its goal of $15,000 by raising nearly $21,000 as of midday Monday, identifies the girls parents as Ashley and David Thornton of Auburn.
This is a GoFundMe page for fourth-grader Taylor Thornton who was killed in a tornado in Lee County, Alabama.

Words dont even come close to imagining the pain they are enduring, it says on the page, which requests donations to cover funeral expenses and/or prayers for the family. Taylor was an amazing example of a child of God. She brought so much joy to all that knew her. She was loved dearly and will forever be missed.
Our hearts are mourning with you Ashley and David. You raised an amazing daughter that fulfilled her purpose on this earth and it now with her creator. This community loves you both, and baby McCrae so much and will continue to walk through this by your side.

Associated Press,"(SEATTLE) — A National Weather Service storm damage survey team is heading to a town west of Seattle where a strong tornado blew through a neighborhood.
The rare twister touched down Tuesday in Port Orchard, Washington. It damaged several homes and toppled trees.
There were no immediate reports of injuries.
The National Weather Service crew will determine just how powerful the storm was.
The Kitsap County sheriff’s office told local media the damage was “catastrophic” and contained to neighborhoods east and south of a Walmart in Port Orchard.
The sheriff’s office says power lines were down and roads were closed in the area.
About 50 buildings were affected.

S.V. Date,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has renewed his attacks on hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico with new and old falsehoods — in stark contrast to his tone and attitude toward disaster-stricken communities in states that voted for him.
Trump Tuesday wrote, falsely: “Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, &amp; all their local politicians do is complain &amp; ask for more money,” and then suggested, also falsely, that Puerto Rico is not part of the United States. “The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, &amp; only take from USA.”
“No part of his statement is even factual,” said Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democratic member of the Florida legislature whose Central Florida district includes thousands of Puerto Rican migrants, including some who moved after Category 4 Maria struck the island in 2017. “His response to Puerto Rico reeks of racism. He treats Puerto Ricans the same way he treats Spanish-speaking immigrants. Like dirt. Like garbage.”
The White House did not respond to HuffPost requests for comment about Trump’s false statements, the tone of which also offers a striking contrast to his statements following previous storms.
“TEXAS: We are with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER, to restore, recover, and REBUILD!” Trump wrote on Sept. 2, 2017, after Hurricane Harvey hit.
And last month, after tornadoes killed 23 in Alabama, Trump wrote: “FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes. @GovernorKayIvey, one of the best in our Country, has been so informed. She is working closely with FEMA (and me!).”
“What makes Puerto Rico different? It’s just really sad,” Smith said. “It’s why he’s so unpopular on the island.”
The Caribbean territory, acquired by the United States more than a century ago following the Spanish-American war, suffered the most devastating damage from a hurricane since Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005. Nearly 3,000 residents died in the storm and in the aftermath — a number Trump claimed was fabricated by his political opponents to make him look bad.
His $91 billion figure appears to be an estimate of how much the reconstruction from the storm will wind up costing over the coming decades. In comparison, Katrina wound up costing $120 billion.
In fact, Puerto Rico has been approved to spend only $300 million in rebuilding assistance so far, the territory’s governor responded on Twitter. “We are Americans, we are your citizens,” Ricardo Rosello wrote. “Puerto Ricans ARE American farmers! American teachers! American citizens! American everything!”
Trump’s latest round of attacks on Puerto Rico started just before midnight Monday after a disaster relief spending bill failed in the Senate because Republicans voted with Trump not to appropriate additional money for Puerto Rico and Democrats would not support a bill that did not include it.
“The politicians are incompetent or corrupt. Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas &amp; Florida combined, yet their government can’t do anything right, the place is a mess - nothing works,” Trump complained. “FEMA &amp; the Military worked emergency miracles, but politicians like the crazed and incompetent Mayor of San Juan have done such a poor job of bringing the Island back to health. 91 Billion Dollars to Puerto Rico, and now the Dems want to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful!”
On Tuesday, the president further claimed that he personally was “the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico” but that he “cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments and so little appreciation.”
It is unclear on what basis Trump was making the first assertion, or whether more appreciation from Puerto Rican leaders would lead to faster and better treatment from FEMA.","Trump lashes out against Americans devastated by Hurricane Maria, just a month after promising Alabama tornado victims that he had ordered “A Plus” treatment for them.",2019-04-02T20:41:13Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Huffpost.com'}",Trump Has Only Love For Disaster Victims — Unless They Are Puerto Ricans,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-puerto-rico-tirade_n_5ca3be78e4b0e6ed9467125d,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ca3bf3c240000a1074f5abb.jpeg?cache=7dOvLJ2wzT&ops=1200_630,,Huffpost.com,tornado,1

Bill Bostock,"Rescuers in Alabama are using using heat-seeking drones to locate bodies of victims buried beneath mounds of rubble caused by deadly tornadoes that killed 23 people. 
 A string of tornadoes ripped through Alabama and Georgia on Sunday, the worst of which passed through Lee County at 160 miles-per-hour, and took the lives of at least two children. 
 Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said on Sunday that heat-seeking drones were being used to scan the debris overnight, and that ground teams would rejoin the hunt for survivors at daybreak on Monday.

ABC News,"Sandbags were holding back floodwaters in parts of Michigan as a storm system moved across several Midwest and Great Plains states on Wednesday, bringing heavy rain, snow and ice to the region. The weather has already been blamed for hundreds of car crashes and several fatalities, including the deaths of four people in a crash along a slippery interstate in Nebraska. Melting snow and heavy rain prompted the National Weather Service to issue flood warnings for parts of northern Illinois and northern Indiana, as well as southern Wisconsin and much of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Flood warnings also were issued for parts of Missouri and Texas. Flooded streets in Michigan stranded motorists and a school bus in Flint, while residents in Mattawan, in the southwestern part of the state, used sandbags to protect homes and businesses as the Mattawan Creek rose above its banks. ""We just got to wait for it to go down,"" Mattawan resident Terry Teeter, who installed pumps to keep water away from his house, told WOOD-TV. ""It's going to be a couple of days like this."" In Illinois, the fear of rising water along the Illinois River forced the evacuation late Tuesday of the LaSalle County Nursing Home in Ottawa. In Indiana, homes and streets were flooded in the South Bend area, and forecasters predicted the local St. Joseph River wouldn't crest until Thursday. Flood watches were issued for several states, while winter weather advisories were in effect Wednesday for an area stretching from southwestern Illinois to Texas, including parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansasm The weather stretched as far south as Arkansas, where strong winds toppled power lines and damaged some buildings late Tuesday and early Wednesday. Two days of rain in southern Wisconsin swelled waterways, prompting road closures. Police and firefighters rescued people from vehicles stranded in high water Tuesday at two sites in Janesville. In western Michigan, officials said a washout from heavy rains may have caused two engines from a freight train to derail near Grand Rapids. No injuries were reported. A 52-year-old woman from Bourbonnais, Illinois, was found dead Tuesday in a submerged car in Peotone, south of Chicago. The woman apparently lost control of her car on southbound Illinois Route 45 and ended up in a rain-filed ditch, Peotone Fire Protection District Deputy Chief Bruce Boyle said. In eastern Nebraska, speed and slippery pavement caused a crash between a pickup truck and a semitrailer Tuesday that killed four people on Interstate 80, police said. The three men and one woman killed were from Colorado, authorities said. The Kansas Highway Patrol said a 38-year-old woman died and two other people were injured in a collision on an icy highway late Monday. In Minnesota, state police said winter weather contributed to 400 crashes and 250 spinouts, including two fatal accidents. The storm system stretched to Texas, where weather service officials said three tornadoes hit. One struck early Tuesday in a rural area near Joshua, destroying at least two mobile homes and severely damaging several others. A mother and her disabled daughter were injured when one twister demolished their mobile home.","ABC News States face flooding, other problems in Midwest amid storms ABC News A mobile home is seen destroyed after a tornado struck an area outside Joshua, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Fort Worth, Texas, Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2018.

Gita Jackson,"The first season of Life Is Strange leaned on melodrama to give some stakes to its story of a time-traveling queer girl and a potentially destructive tornado. This seasons first episode also leans into schlock, but this time, the story is about racism in America. Sometimes, that melodrama made me groan. When it works, though, it really works. Near the beginning of the game, the character you play as, Sean Diaz, talks to his dad about getting older, and his dad makes an offhand reference to how things are kinda scary out there in this country right now. Soon afterward, you find out exactly what he was referring to. When Sean gets in a fight with his neighbor Brett, Brett yells, Go back to your own country. The Diazes are Mexican, Brett is white, and the game takes place in 2016. When I first got to this sequence, I groaned. There are people who are racist in that way, by yelling explicitly racist things at people of other races, but in my life, my experience of racism is more subtle. Later in the game, other characters express racism in more subtle ways that rang more true to me, such as in a scene when Sean and his younger brother Daniel are on the run and stop at a gas station where they get a cold reception. There isnt an explicit antagonist in Life Is Strange 2, like there was in the first game, in which the main characters were trying to solve a murder. Theres just an air of unease. In my first go around at this episode, I was trying to put a finger on what made me so uncomfortable as I played it. I realized on my second playthrough that the actual antagonist, the force that the players are running from, is the constant spectre of racially motivated violence. The plot is kicked off by that kind of violent incident. Sean gets into a fight with Brett, and in the course of it, Brett falls and lands on a rock, injuring himself badly. A cop who was passing by leaves his car and takes out his gun. Seans dad, who came out to diffuse the situation, ends up getting shot by the cop. He had his hands up and he was unarmed. For a split second, I thought to myself, Well, that would never happen. Then I remembered the murder of Tamir Rice, a twelve year old boy playing with an airsoft rifle on a playground. The police shot him dead. I remembered Trayvon Martin, a seventeen year old walking home from the store with candy and a drink, who was killed by George Zimmerman. It does happen. People do look at brown and black bodies, especially brown and black men, and just assume that violence is necessary. The murder of Seans father is shocking, but the later sequence in the gas station more clearly illustrates the fear of random interactions escalating into violence. This is the first time Sean and Daniel have interacted with other people since theyve been on the run, and once you start talking to people, you realize how uneasy they are around you. Youre in rural Washington, and youre two Mexican kids without a guardian. When you go into the store and speak to the woman at the register, she says to you, You dont look like youre from around here. Sean and Daniel have lived in Washington state for their entire lives. Their father grew up in Mexico, but his two kids are as American as they can possibly be. But their otherness is ever present. In that gas station, they are the only two people of color. It reminded me of what it was like to drive to college with my dad. Wed always stop once in rural Pennsylvania, grab gas, food and go to the bathroom. Every time I went to a Burger King in some anonymous town, I would realize quickly how out of place we looked, a black man and his daughter in a sea of white people. Like Sean, I tried to make myself as small and unnoticeable as possible, not wanting to incite uncomfortable questioning. New York Times editorial writer Brent Staples wrote in his 1986 essay for Harpers Bazaar, Black Men and Public Space, about the time when he understood out that his mere presence on the street made white women afraid. It was in the echo of that terrified womans footfalls that I first began to know the unwieldy inheritance Id come intothe ability to alter public space in ugly ways, he wrote. Her flight made me feel like an accomplice in tyranny. It also made it clear that I was indistinguishable from the muggers who occasionally seeped into the area from the surrounding ghetto. That first encounter, and those that followed, signified that a vast, unnerving gulf lay between nighttime pedestriansparticularly womenand me. Later in the essay, Staples describes a self-conscious impulse to change the way he presented himself so as to dispel the fear he elicited just by being a black man in the world. I move about with care, particularly late in the evening, he wrote. And on late-evening constitutionals I employ what has proved to be an excellent tension reducing measure: I whistle melodies from Beethoven and Vivaldi and the more popular classical composers. Virtually everybody seems to sense that a mugger wouldnt be warbling bright, sunny selections from Vivaldis Four Seasons. It is my equivalent of the cowbell that hikers wear when they know they are in bear country. Part of these conscious tension-reducing measures come from the fear that your presence as a racial other in a public space will eventually mean that violence is enacted on you. Staples also recounts a story of another black journalist going to the scene of a murder to investigate and then being mistaken for the killer. The journalist was hauled to a police car at gunpoint and was almost arrested until he presented his press credentials. In Life Is Strange 2, that violence is not just an unfounded fear. It happens to you. Later, when Sean and Daniel are eating lunch on a picnic bench, a man comes up to them and accuses them of stealing. You have an option to run, start a fight, or try to talk to him. All three options will have the same result; this man will always mark you as fugitives and will tie you to a pipe in his office. Both times I played, I opted to talk to him, trying to diffuse the situation. I didnt want to justify the violence I knew was coming by starting a fight, didnt want to look guilty by running. So, I made Sean do the closest option to whistling Vivaldi. I knew it was futile, but that is the delicate dance you have to play when youre in a strange place and people look at you a little too long. How can I show them that I, too, am a person? How do I stop the fear of my black body from turning into violence enacted upon it? Being a person of color means always being aware of your otherness. Youre aware of it when you walk through a room, by the way that people eye you, cross the street to get away from you, follow you around a convenience store to make sure you arent stealing. Its also impossible to ignore in Life Is Strange 2, in part because they lay it on thick. Occasional corniness aside, thats just how I perceive my own reality. It might feel hackneyed to some players, and at times it is. But other times, Life Is Strange 2 rings uncomfortably true.","The first season of Life Is Strange leaned on melodrama to give some stakes to its story of a time-traveling queer girl and a potentially destructive tornado.

Midwest Communications Inc.,"By Brendan O'Brien MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - A powerful spring storm pummeled the U.S. Midwest and Plains on Saturday with blizzard conditions and high winds, while tornadoes and thunderstorms menaced some of the South. Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota were under warnings for blizzard-like conditions. The city of St. Paul, Minnesota, declared a snow emergency. Forecasters were expecting more than a foot (30 cm) of snow in parts of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Wind gusts around Duluth, Minnesota, had exceeded 50 miles (80 km) per hour, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. ""Mother nature continues to troll us,"" the agency's office serving the Minneapolis/St. Paul region said on Twitter, posting a video of snow falling at a rate of 1 to 2 inches (2 to 5 cm) per hour. As the storm pushed south into Saturday evening, authorities warned that severe thunderstorms could bring gusting winds, flooding and hail. Severe weather warnings extended from Texas to central Alabama, which was under a tornado watch. At least one tornado packing winds up to 90 miles (145 km) per hour was reported near Jackson, Mississippi, the NWS said. Freezing rain and ice storms were expected to move into northern New England through Monday. National weather forecasters also cautioned that high winds were producing critical fire conditions in the Southern Plains. On Friday, the system produced 17 reports of tornadoes in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Texas, the weather service said. Four people were injured and 160 buildings damaged in a possible tornado in northwest Arkansas, local media reported. An overnight storm killed a 1-year-old girl when a tree fell on a recreational vehicle where she was sleeping, the sheriff's office in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, said. State Governor John Bel Edwards said in a statement that emergency responders had been activated in anticipation of severe weather. Some 750 flights in and out of airports in Minnesota and Toronto were canceled, the website flightaware.com reported. The airport in Rochester, Minnesota, said on Twitter it had canceled all flights until Sunday morning ""due to the extreme weather conditions."" Rapidly falling snow also prompted Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to suspend flight operations into Saturday evening. About 29,000 customers in Texas and Louisiana were without power on Saturday afternoon, along with an additional 50,000 in Michigan and Wisconsin, the website Poweroutage.us reported.

Amanda Curran,"MONTGOMERY, AL (WSFA) - The WSFA First Alert Weather Team has declared a First Alert Weather Day in anticipation of widespread heavy rain and strong to severe thunderstorms. The risk for severe weather runs from now through early Sunday morning across far east Alabama. As the band of thunderstorms progresses eastward, heavy rain and strong to severe thunderstorms will develop across our entire region into the overnight hours before exiting east Alabama Sunday morning. Earlier this afternoon a Tornado Watch was issued for western counties across both central and south Alabama; that expired at 7 p.m., and now there is a new Tornado Watch for far south and west Alabama counties. This new watch will last until 2 a.m. on Sunday morning. A few models have hinted at a weak low developing to our southwest. Should this occur, some enhancement of thunderstorm activity would result in a slight increase in the overall severe weather potential. As the line of storms continues east, pockets of damaging winds and isolated tornadoes will be possible. Flash flooding remains a big concern as well due to the slow moving nature of this system; Flash Flood Watches and even a few warnings have been issued, and they are concentrated in western portions of Alabama as of right now. We encourage you to stay up to date with the latest updates into the weekend as new information becomes available. While our overall severe weather threat appears to be on the lower end of the spectrum, the risk is greater in some areas and lower in others.

James Spann,"From James Spann and the ABC 33/40 Weather Blog: SUNSHINE RETURNS LATER TODAY: A weakening band of storms is pushing through Central and East Alabama this morning the tornado watch that was in effect much of the night has been cancelled for all counties as of 5:30 a.m. There is a marginal risk (level 1/5) of severe storms for parts of Southeast Alabama later today, but the overall threat there is low. The sky will begin to clear later today, and most North/Central Alabama communities will enjoy a good supply of sunshine by afternoon with a high in the 68-74 degree range. Tonight will be fair and cool with a low between 48 and 54 degrees. REST OF THE WEEK: The surface front to the south will move slowly northward as a warm front tomorrow clouds move back in and we will forecast a few periods of rain, mainly during the afternoon and evening hours. The high will be close to 70. Then, rain remains possible at times Thursday and Friday with a cooling trend; the high Thursday will be in the low 60s, and close to 60 degrees Friday. Additional rain amounts of around one inch are likely tomorrow through Friday. The sky should clear Friday night. THE ALABAMA WEEKEND: Very cool air settles into the state; we expect a sunny sky Saturday and Sunday, but temperatures will be below average. The high Saturday will be in the mid 50s, and close to 60 Sunday. Morning lows will be well down in the 30s widespread frost seems likely by early Sunday morning. Colder pockets will see lows in the 20s Saturday and Sunday morning. NEXT WEEK: Even colder air arrives by the middle of next week; sure looks like highs could drop into the 40s, with lows in the 20s by Wednesday and Thursday. Easily the coldest air so far this season and most of the week looks dry. See the Weather Xtreme video for maps, graphics, and more details. LAST NIGHTS STORMS: Several counties in North and West Alabama were placed under a tornado warning, and there were a number of reports of tree and power line damage but thankfully no major structural damage was reported in our state. To the north, a woman died and two others were injured when a possible tornado ravaged a neighborhood in Rutherford County, Tennessee. The deceased womans identity was not revealed, but police said her home collapsed when the severe weather hit the Midland area of Christiana, Tennessee. Two others were injured in a mobile home that was damaged and rolled over during the storm. BEACH FORECAST: Click here to see the AlabamaWx Beach Forecast Center page.

Ken Miller / AP,"(OKLAHOMA CITY) — Emergency officials in Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas are bracing for two types of disasters as spring gets into full swing: The start of what’s historically the most active time of year for tornadoes plus wildfire threats brought on by severe drought. April, May and June are the most active months in the U.S. for tornadoes. At the same time, the three states on the southern end of Tornado Alley are experiencing extreme and exceptional drought that could fuel wildfires. Tornado Alley extends from northern Texas and covers much of Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota, plus slivers of New Mexico and Colorado, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Prediction Center. The past three years, the U.S. has seen an average of more than 600 tornadoes during April, May and June, according to the center. That is more than half the average of 1,186 tornadoes per year during that time span, although the numbers from the last three months of 2017 are still considered preliminary. Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas are accustomed to preparing for multiple emergency situations happening at once and train with various agencies to account for different possibilities. “We’re typically preparing for worst-case scenarios year-round anyway,” state Department of Emergency Management spokeswoman Keli Cain said, noting that the SPC reports Oklahoma City has been struck by more tornadoes than any other U.S. city, with more than 100 known twisters. “We do have some experience at that. We plan for all hazards anyway.” Katie Horner, spokeswoman for the Kansas adjutant general’s division of emergency management, said last year the state dealt with a blizzard, an ice storm, fire, flooding and a tornado warning all in the same week. “We train not only for one or two events in a day, but three or four events in a day,” she added. Chip Orton, the emergency management director for Amarillo, a city of about 200,000 in the Texas Panhandle, says, “My job is to be worried.” “That’s why we come to work every day. Is it likely? Probably not. Could it happen? Sure,” he said. While tornadoes are the result of thunderstorms, which are created from conditions that include moisture, the current dry conditions in the area do not preclude twisters, said Storm Prediction Center meteorologist Patrick Marsh. He noted that two tornadoes were reported in the Texas Panhandle on March 18, even as the area was rated in extreme drought. Some private forecasting services are predicting an increase in tornadoes during the coming months, based largely on the fact that there was the climate phenomenon La Nina during the past winter. They’re expecting weather patterns in the coming months to be wetter and warmer than usual, particularly in the southeastern U.S. and along the Gulf Coast. “(Those conditions) would be a petri dish for thunderstorms. You need to add an additional ingredient for tornados. … You need wind shear. Wind shear is best described as a change in wind speed and direction,” Marsh said, and is created when cold air and warm air collide at the surface. The national Storm Prediction Center, however, does not forecast severe weather more than about a week in advance.","Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas brace for two types of disasters as spring begins",2018-04-07T18:26:07Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas Face Tornado and Wildfire Threats",http://time.com/5232050/tornado-alley-oklahoma-texas-kansas/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/tornado-oklahoma.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,tornado,1
"USA TODAY, Jorge L. Ortiz, USA TODAY","Clean up and recovery efforts begin after a reported F-3 tornado rips through Lee County, Alabama.
 USA TODAY
The tornado that devastated rural parts of eastern Alabama left behind a deadly trail, compared by one official to a giant knife scraping the ground.
Early reports put the number of casualties at 23, but that figure could rise as rescuers search amid the destroyed homes for victims.
The town of Beauregard, an unincorporated community of about 10,000 in Lee County, took a major hit from the Sunday twister, whose winds were estimated at 170 mph.
All we could do is just hold on for life and pray, said Jonathan Clardy, who huddled with his family inside their Beauregard trailer as the tornado ripped the roof off. Its a blessing from God that me and my youngns are alive.
Identities of the victims are starting to emerge.
Taylor Thornton
The Lee-Scott Academy, a Christian school in Auburn, Ala., reported on its Facebook page the passing of its fourth-grade student, saying Taylor was welcomed into the arms of Jesus as the result of the severe weather event in Lee County yesterday.
Our hearts at Lee-Scott Academy are broken this morning. Please pray for the Thornton family, our students, faculty, and staff during this difficult time.
The school has scheduled a community-wide prayer for Tuesday morning.
The posting mentions that a GoFundMe page has been established on behalf of Taylors family. The page, which had already surpassed its goal of $15,000 by raising more than $23,000 as of midday Monday, identifies the girls parents as Ashley and David Thornton of Auburn.
This is a GoFundMe page for fourth-grader Taylor Thornton who was killed in a tornado in Lee County, Alabama.

""Words dont even come close to imagining the pain they are enduring, it says on the page, which requests donations to cover funeral expenses and/or prayers for the family. Taylor was an amazing example of a child of God. She brought so much joy to all that knew her. She was loved dearly and will forever be missed.
Our hearts are mourning with you Ashley and David. You raised an amazing daughter that fulfilled her purpose on this earth and it now with her creator. This community loves you both, and baby McCrae so much and will continue to walk through this by your side.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","Golf ball-sized hail pelted parts of Colorado on Monday, June 18, followed by multiple tornado sightings the next day. USA TODAY For the first time since 2005, and only the second time on record, no one was killed by tornadoes in the U.S. in either May or June. (Photo: Brian Davidson / Getty Images) For the first time since 2005, and only the second time on record, no one was killed by tornadoes in the U.S. in either May or June. Those are typically two of the USA’s deadliest months for tornadoes, along with March and April. Official U.S. tornado records go back to 1950. Although we have a long way to go, the U.S. could see its least deadly year for tornadoes on record: So far in 2018, tornadoes have killed only 3 people this year. The most recent was on April 13 in Louisiana, according to the Storm Prediction Center. An average of 71 Americans are killed each year by tornadoes, based on data from 1987-2016, the Weather Channel reported. Based on the official database, the year with the fewest tornado deaths was 1986, when 15 people died. Unofficial records – from before 1950 – show that in 1910, only 12 people were killed by tornadoes. Not surprisingly, the lack of tornado deaths coincides with a very quiet year for twisters overall. So far, there have been 571 reports of tornadoes across the U.S. this year. (That number is preliminary, and will likely be reduced once duplicate reports are discounted.) On average, during the first six months of the year, about 1,000 tornadoes hit the U.S. More: Oklahoma hasn't had a single tornado yet this year More: U.S. sets record of 246 straight days without a tornado death Warm, humid air is one of the ingredients needed for tornadoes to form, and for much of the early part of the year, it was lacking in the central U.S. Frequent rounds of chilly air from Canada, thanks to a persistent southward dip in the jet stream over the eastern U.S., helped to keep temperature and humidity surges to a minimum, according to AccuWeather. The biggest tornado droughts this year are in the Plains states of Texas and Oklahoma, in the southern part of ""Tornado Alley."" An unfavorable jet stream position kept twisters away from the region until early May, the Weather Channel reported. And when storm systems finally did arrive, they didn't produce many tornadoes. Meteorologist Harold Brooks of the National Severe Storms Laboratory said there aren't typically many U.S. tornado deaths after the spring storm season. Summer and early fall are typically quiet, he said, before the ""second tornado season"" of November.
