Michael Hardy,"In 2011, a devastating tsunami crashed into the northeast coast of Japan, destroying entire villages, killing thousands and causing a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In the wake of the disaster, the Japanese government implemented a number of reforms, including relocating coastal villages to higher land and forbidding further development along the northeast coastline. The most controversial of these tsunami prevention measures was the construction of hundreds of miles of concrete seawalls and breakers along the most vulnerable stretches of the coast. So far, Japan has spent approximately $12 billion building towering concrete walls, some as high as 41 feet. Tokyo-born photographer Tadashi Ono, who now lives in Paris, traveled to Japan’s northeast coast after the 2011 tsunami to document the destruction, and recently returned to see how the impacted areas have changed. (He took the photos while serving as artist-in-residence at L'institut Français's Villa Kujoyama in Kyoto.) He was shocked by the ominous grey walls that now line the coast. ""What I’m interested in as a photographer is how they’ve totally shut out the views of the sea,"" Ono says. ""I'm walking in the sea coast area, I want to take a photo of the coast, but I can’t see it."" Many local residents make their living in either fishing or tourism; now, both industries are under threat from the walls. Fishermen worry they will disrupt runoff from the mountains into the sea, which helps replenish the water’s rich nutrients. And how many tourists will want to visit the coast if they can’t actually see the coast? Ono blames the impetus for the massive infrastructure project on a powerful central government unresponsive to local concerns, as well as the giant Japanese construction companies who benefit from massive government contracts. What’s more, Ono believes the walls are unnecessary. Coastal villages have already been moved to higher ground. ""Before the tsunami there were towns in those areas, but now nobody lives there—it’s just rice fields or vacant land. So the seawalls protect nothing,"" he says. ""They were constructed just to be constructed."" Some people have even argued that seawalls are counterproductive, since they might provide a false sense of security, discouraging people from moving to higher ground. On a deeper level, Ono sees the walls as an abandonment of Japanese history and culture. ""Our richness as a civilization is because of our contact with the ocean,"" he says. ""Japan has always lived with the sea, and we were protected by the sea. And now the Japanese government has decided to shut out the sea.""

Angela Watercutter,"Every year, the tradeoff is real: What panel are you willing to sacrifice in order to see another? Even in a year when HBO and Marvel are staying away, the days at Comic-Con International are so stacked with events that hard choices need to be made. We feel that pain, and are here to help. Below are all the panels and events that we think will be the biggest deals at this year’s con. It’s not a comprehensive list—there are always gems hidden away for any pop-culture interest you can imagine—but if you’re looking for the blockbusters, these are a good place to start. The Rebirth of the Predator Franchise Writer-director Shane Black starred in 1987’s Predator, the story of a brutal alien who sees the world through a heat-activated, Hypercolor-shirt-like lens. That film inspired a handful of sequels and spin-offs (including the magnificently hyper-violent Predator 2 ), but none with the pulpy pedigree of Black, who wrote the original Lethal Weapon, and directed the high-flying Iron Man 3. His revival of the Predator series stars Wonder -kind Jacob Tremblay as a pre-teen who accidentally beckons one of the space-hunters to our planet, where it wreaks havoc with rangers and government officials before going to battle with an even bigger bad guy: a super-creature rumored to be named the Mega-Predator. Hopefully the members of Black’s delightfully disparate cast—including Olivia Munn, Keegan-Michael Key, Sterling K. Brown, and Jake Busey (Jake Busey!)—will be appearing at Comic-Con, and can tell us once and for all just how much The Predator ’s plot cribs from the Ice Cube album of the same name. All in all, we expect it to be a good day. M. Night Shyamalan Breaks Some Glass News Nearly two decades ago, writer-director M. Night Shyamalan released his post- Sixth Sense superhero drama Unbreakable —and then watched it get busted at the box office by How the Grinch Stole Christmas. But Unbreakable ’s story of an unremarkable security guard (played by Bruce WIllis) who discovers his abilities was championed by comic-book lovers, who marveled at Shyamalan’s grounded, tights-free tale of real-world powers run amok. Fans like Patton Oswalt lobbied for a sequel, and last year, they unexpectedly got in one in Split, the hit thriller featuring James McAvoy as a monstrous creature who lives in the same Unbreakable universe. In Glass, Shyamalan brings together Willis, McAvoy, and Samuel L. Jackson—as high-haired villain Mr. Glass—and all three actors will presumably be in attendance for the film’s big Comic-Con presentation. Expect plenty of evasive answers from the panel about the film itself, as Shyamalan is a master practitioner of that rarest 21st-century super-power: Secrecy. DC Goes Big (Because Everyone Else Went Home) Let’s face it: This year, DC has the run of the place during the traditionally booming and crowded Saturday afternoon in Hall H. In previous years, DC parent Warner Bros. has had a whiz-bang showing, bringing everything from Lord of the Rings films to Justice Leagues and Suicide Squads, but they’ve always had to compete with the likes of Marvel Studios and Fox, which usually saw fit to bring a few X-Men. This year, that’s not the case. At least one Fox hero is coming—there’s a Deadpool 2 panel—but there’s no Marvel Studios, no Lucasfilm. So, if Warner Bros. wants to take full advantage, they need to throw everything they've got at this one. And “everything” in this case will hopefully include footage from James Wan’s Aquaman, an appearance from Wonder Woman/Gal Gadot and her director Patty Jenkins, and Chris Pine/Steve Trevor in a fanny pack. In a dream world the panel would also include director Ava DuVernay talking about her forthcoming New Gods adaptation, but maybe that’s just wishful thinking. The New (Female) Doctor Who It’s a glass ceiling that took more than five decades to crack but the beloved British series Doctor Who is finally getting a female lead. Jodie Whittaker, aka the Thirteenth Doctor, will be on-hand to discuss her new role and likely have fans cheering in the aisles. (The wailing and gnashing of teeth sets off on Thursday morning in Hall H, if you’re wondering.) It’s going to be a big deal, one that fans have been anticipating for a very long time, so it’ll be an emotional room. And the post-panel Q&amp;A—always a plethora of off-beat questions—will likely be full of wonderfully excited Whovians ready to hop in a TARDIS and follow Whittaker to the ends of the Earth. In a con that feels slightly more subdued in 2018, this’ll be a highlight. Deadpool 2 Drops In … and Maybe Brings an X-Force with It? Remember what we said a minute ago about Hall H being awfully quiet on Saturday? Well, one of the things scheduled to make a little noise in that hallowed hall is a panel on Deadpool 2. Wait, Deadpool 2 ? Didn’t that already come out? Yes, it did. Which is why this panel is interesting. Why would the franchise’s corporate parents at Fox grab a slot in Comic-Con’s biggest room on its biggest day to plug the home release of a movie it’s already released? Moreover, why would it do so and then not announce who’s participating? (The Comic-Con website still doesn’t have any details listed.) Call it a hunch, but we’re wondering if Ryan Reynolds and company might use the stage time to tease the allegedly forthcoming X-Force movie](http://ew.com/movies/2018/05/29/drew-goddard-x-force-future-deadpool-2-scene/) from writer-director Drew Goddard. Again, it’s just a hunch, but considering what a favorite the Merc with a Mouth is with fans, it would bring the house down if they pulled it off. Castle Rock Lands On Us If there's one place Stephen King loves more than Maine, it's the fictional town within Maine where he's set multiple books and short stories. Cujo ? That happened in Castle Rock; Dead Zone too. Now, backdrop becomes locus in Hulu's forthcoming original series, which seems to be a going for a whole-multiverse-in-one sort of feel: the recent trailer references everything from Cujo to Needful Things. After years away, a lawyer and onetime son of Castle Rock (André Holland) finds himself called back to investigate a matter at Shawshank Prison (!), where a young man (Bill Skarsgård, Pennywise in last year's It ), has been discovered locked away. With a cast that includes Sissy Spacek and Melanie Lynskey, and enough Kingly material to satisfy even Annie Wilkes, Castle Rock has much to recommend it—even if Hulu's previous King adaptation wasn't a Shining example. Amazon's Prime Cuts It may look like no one can catch up to Netflix's developmental spending spree, but Amazon isn't conceding the streaming wars quite yet, as evidenced by the forthcoming titles teaming up for a creators' panel on Saturday. You've got fan favorites salvaged from the cancellation pile at other networks ( The Expanse ), buzzy podcast adapations ( Homecoming, starring Julia Roberts and helmed by Mr. Robot 's Sam Esmail), Neil Gaiman miniseries ( Good Omens, based on Gaiman's collaboration with Terry Pritchard), and pricey action reboots ( Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, with John Krasinksi in the starring role and Carlton Cuse showrunning). And that's not not to mention Season 2 peeks at Gale Ann Hurd's Lore and Ben Edlund's Tick. So, yeah, six shows. One hour doesn't seem like enough—consider us two-day shippers. Sony Lets Fans See For Miles Sure, Sony and Marvel may have struck a deal to get Spidey into the MCU. And sure, Spider-Man: Far From Home continues that story next summer. But Sony also owns a bunch of arachno-adjacent Marvel IP—and it's spinning its own web in the meantime. If the promise of extended Venom footage doesn't get you into that Hall H line, consider that it presumably comes with a healthy side of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The animated feature not only boasts a screenplay by Phil Lord (half of the duo responsible for the 21 Jump Street reboot and Solo: A Star Wars Story Lego Movie ), but it takes a cue from the comics and acknowledges multiple Spider-Mans. Spider-Men? Anyway, the webslinger this time around is comics mainstay Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore). Don't worry, Peter Parker shows up too (Jake Johnson, just part of a killer cast that also includes Mahershala Ali, Lily Tomlin, and Bryan Tyree Henry). And hell, even if you hate spiders, it sounds like James Gunn has something up his sleeve. The Horror of Halloween Ever since John Carpenter’s babysitter-shocking 1978 original, the Halloween series has suffered under the curse of Michael Myers: Several (mostly) hollow sequels, a slashed-up timeline, and a nagging sense of obsolescence in the era of supernatural horror hits like The Conjuring. The latest Halloween sequel, the first since 2002, is intended to clear out the canon. Directed by Stronger and Pineapple Express filmmaker David Gordon Green—and co-written by Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley— Halloween pretends those other installments never existed, instead follows the events of the original film, in which young Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) was pursued by the masked killer known as The Shape. Forty years later, Myers has escaped, and Laurie is eager to finish him for good. Expect Hall H to fill with Halloween fans happily singing along to the original’s Plink -plink-plink- Plink -plink-plink theme song. Here’s hoping they remembered to bring along the correct mask. The Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog Reunion Friends, how has it been a decade since Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog ? It feels like just yesterday Neil Patrick Harris’ wannabe baddie charmed his way into our hearts, no? Regardless, that milestone is upon us and now the lovely web series that sprung to life from the mind of Joss Whedon during the 2008 writers’ strike is having a lil’ reunion at this year’s con. Whedon is expected to attend, along with his brother Jed Whedon, and stars Nathan Fillion, Felicia Day, and Maurissa Tancharoen. (Sadly, Harris isn’t currently on the lineup.) Expect a lot of laughs and at least one panelist to break out in song. ::Fingers crossed:: More Great WIRED Stories","Horror sequels, a Momoa-shaped tsunami, and the Spider-Man we've all been waiting for—SDCC may be light this year, but there's plenty to look forward to.",2018-07-18T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Comic-Con 2018: What We're Most Looking Forward to at This Year's Convention,https://www.wired.com/story/comic-con-2018-preview/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b4e73eebeabfb0b6ce34a20/191:100/pass/aquaman.jpg,wired,Wired,tsunami,1
Chaim Gartenberg,"This morning, an error in AccuWeather’s apps caused a routine National Weather Service tsunami test to go out to as a push notification or SMS alert, warning people of a nonexistent tsunami across the East Coast, reports The Herald Tribune. The alert — which was meant as a test of transmission times for actual alerts — was apparently flagged as a genuine alert by the AccuWeather app, causing users with notifications enabled to wake up to a tsunami warning this morning. According to the NWS’s Miami branch, the tsunami test is one that is regularly conducted on a monthly basis, but apparently something went wrong this month that triggered the alerts for AccuWeather users. The false alarm was sent to residents across the East Coast and some parts of the South, including Houston, New Orleans, Charlotte, Charleston, and the New England area. Generally speaking, while it is possible, an East Coast tsunami is considered to be unlikely, due to the dramatically lower rate of earthquakes compared to the West Coast. But such a storm could still occur with catastrophic results. Just got a Tsunami Warning for New York, but apparently it’s just a test.

The Hawaii alert went out over the statewide alert system and on TV networks. The AccuWeather failure, while still bad, looks less severe by comparison, only notifying users with what seems to be a single specific weather app. ***THERE IS NO TSUNAMI WARNING*** A Tsunami Test was conducted earlier this morning, that did have TEST in the message.

Vince Beiser,"The night before the mission, Kenji Matsuzaki could not sleep. For more than a year, Matsuzaki and a team of engineers had been developing their little robot—a bread-loaf-sized, red and white machine equipped with five propellers, a transparent dome, front and rear video cameras, and an array of lights and sensors. Nicknamed Little Sunfish, it was engineered to operate ­underwater, in total darkness, amid intense radiation. And after three months of testing, training, and fine-tuning, it was deemed ready to fulfill its mission: to find and photograph the melted-down radioactive fuel that had gone missing inside the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. More than six years had passed since an earthquake and tsunami hammered northeastern Japan and reduced the Fukushima facility to radioactive ruin. In all that time, no one had been able to locate the hundreds of tons of fuel inside the three reactors that had suffered core meltdowns. The uranium fuel had overheated, turned into lava, and burned through its steel container. That much was known. What happened after that was the big question. Did all the fuel flow out of the reactors, or was some still inside? Did it pile up in a heap, spread out in a puddle, spatter on the walls? Without knowing the answers to those questions, it was nearly impossible to devise a plan to get rid of it. And getting rid of it is imperative. Every day, as much as 165 tons of groundwater seeps into the reactors, becoming contaminated with radiation. And there’s always the possibility that another earthquake or some other disaster could rupture the reactors again, sending radiation spilling out into the air, sea, or both. Human beings couldn’t go into the heart of Fukushima’s reactors to find the missing fuel, though—at least not without absorbing a lethal dose of radiation. The job would have to be done by robots. But no robot had ever carried out such a mission before. Many had already tried and failed. Debris tripped them up. Yard-thick concrete walls threatened to block their wireless signals. Radiation fouled up their microprocessors and camera components. And so it fell to Matsuzaki, a shy-eyed, 41-year-old senior scientist with Toshiba’s nuclear technology branch, to help build a machine that wouldn’t end up as another one of the robot corpses already littering the reactors. Just getting the Sunfish and its support gear into position inside the enormous concrete building that housed one of the crippled reactors took two days. Four separate teams took turns setting up the control panel, cable drum, and other equipment the robot would need to function. Even in full protective bodysuits, each group of workers could spend only a few minutes inside the structure, working by the light of portable electric lamps amid a thicket of machinery, pipes, and catwalks. When one team absorbed its maximum permitted daily dose of radiation, it was replaced by another group. Matsuzaki himself made two forays inside to put the final touches on the Sunfish, sweating inside his face mask and bodysuit in the summer heat, his nerves jumping each time his portable monitor dinged to indicate he’d received another increment of his allowable radiation dose. The plan was for the Sunfish to spend three days mapping the debris and searching for signs of the missing fuel. Matsuzaki would monitor its progress from a control room about 500 yards away. He would be joined by a half-dozen top officials from his employer, Toshiba, and Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), the mammoth utility that owns the plant. His success—or failure—would be broadcast daily around the world. Beyond the immediate danger, cleaning up Fukushima remains critical to repairing the image of Japan’s energy industry. In the wake of the disaster, Japan shut down every one of its dozens of nuclear plants, which had provided some 27 percent of the nation’s power. To cover the loss, it had to massively increase imports of expensive fossil fuels. A few nuclear plants have since been permitted to restart, following years of safety upgrades, but Fukushima cost the industry much of its public support. Polls consistently show that a majority of the public opposes nuclear power. Two of Japan’s former prime ministers, including the one in office at the time of the disaster, have flipped from supporting nuclear plants to calling for their elimination. The disaster also dealt a severe blow to the global nuclear industry, which had been gaining favor even among some environmentalists as a carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels. In the aftermath of the meltdown, Germany announced it would phase out nuclear power altogether, Vietnam dropped plans to build reactors, and the whole industry was thrown on the defensive. Every proposed new reactor now has to answer the question: How do we know this won’t be another Fukushima? Small wonder that in the nights leading up to the mission, Matsuzaki was feeling the pressure. “I’ve been having nightmares about failing,” he confessed to his boss, Akira Tsuyuki. “Me too,” Tsuyuki said. Late at night on July 18, 2017, the mission start time just a few hours away, Matsuzaki lay awake, wondering whether his team’s technology would be any match for Fukushima. The earthquake on March 11, 2011, was the biggest ever recorded in Japanese history, a 9.0 monster that devastated northeastern Japan and triggered a series of tsunamis that slammed into the coast, killing nearly 16,000 people. The tsunamis also knocked out power to the Fukushima Daiichi plant, shutting down the pumps needed to keep cooling water circulating in the reactor cores. Over the next several days, as Tepco engineers worked by flashlight to regain control, the fuel in three of the plant’s six reactors—Units 1, 2, and 3—melted down. Gases unleashed by the damage exploded, sending plumes of radioactive particles like iodine, cesium, and plutonium into the atmosphere. The government ordered everyone within a 12-mile radius to evacuate, with about 165,000 people eventually displaced. Government officials originally estimated it would take about 40 years and $50 billion to clean up the plant, decontaminate the surrounding area, and compensate the disaster’s victims. In December 2016, they more than tripled that estimate to $188 billion. “We have never experienced a disaster as big as Fukushima,” Hiroshige Seko, the head of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, told reporters at the time, according to Bloomberg. “With our limited knowledge, it was very difficult to make the previous forecast.” The Fukushima cleanup is a project far bigger and more complex than those of even the world’s worst previous nuclear catastrophes. Chernobyl was literally covered up: The Soviets simply encased the whole thing in concrete and steel. Three Mile Island was tiny by comparison. Only a single reactor melted down, and none of its fuel escaped. “Fukushima is orders of magnitude more difficult,” says Lake Barrett, an American who oversaw the cleanup of Three Mile Island and who signed on as a consultant to Tepco and the Japanese government in 2013. The Hot Zone Following the meltdown, nearly 165,000 people had to evacuate the area surrounding the Fukushima plant to avoid radioactive exposure. Today, even after extensive cleanup efforts, 50,000 people still can’t go home. In the first chaotic weeks after the meltdown, with radiation levels far too intense for anyone to work inside the reactors, Tepco scrambled to deploy robots to assess and contain the damage. Tractor-treaded bots from iRobot, drones from Honeywell, and a prototype disaster-­response mech from Tohoku University scouted the rubble-­strewn facility and tried to measure the intensity of the radiation. A remote-­controlled concrete pumping truck was adapted so that its extendable spout could pour water into the reactors, cooling and stabilizing the overheated chambers. In the months and years that followed, Fukushima became both a market and a proving ground for ever-advancing robot technologies designed to operate in hazardous conditions. Remote-controlled front-end loaders, backhoes, and other heavy equipment were put to work breaking up radioactive debris and loading it onto remote-controlled dump trucks. A four-legged walking robot investigated the reactor buildings. Robots with 3-D scanners were sent in to gather imagery and map radiation levels. Swimming robots inspected pools where spent fuel rods were stored, taking pictures. But none of these robots were capable of penetrating the innermost areas of the reactors. In August 2013, the Japanese government assembled a consortium of public utilities and private companies, including Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Toshiba, to create robots specifically for the most challenging environments. Dubbed the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning, it has developed some 20 machines that have been deployed onsite. Their ranks include a snakelike bot that crawled through a tiny accessway into Unit 1, then bent itself into a more stable U-shape to explore inside. Then there was the Scorpion, a tank-tread-driven machine with a camera mounted on an elevating “tail” that was sent into Unit 2. The Japanese government is bankrolling a $100 million, state-of-the-art R&amp;D center near the nuclear plant where robot operators train on digital models of the reactors in a giant 3-D Holo Stage and on life-size physical mock-ups. A robot undergoes testing at the government’s new $100 million R&amp;D center near the nuclear plant. But even with the massive government investment, many of the new robots still couldn’t hack it inside the reactors. The camera on one of them, sent to clear a path for the Scorpion, was shut down by radiation; the Scorpion itself got tripped up by fallen debris. The first version of the snakelike bot got stuck; the second did better but failed to find any melted fuel. “It’s very difficult to design a robot to operate in an unknown environment,” says Hajime Asama, a professor at the University of Tokyo who was one of the first roboticists the government turned to for help. “Until we send the bot in, we don’t know what the conditions are. And after it’s sent, we can’t change it.” Kenji Matsuzaki has worked in Toshiba’s nuclear technology branch for more than 10 years, and by May 2016, when he was assigned to the team developing a robot to explore inside Unit 3 of Fukushima, he was familiar with the plant’s basic architecture. All six of its reactors are boiling-water reactors, a type designed in the late 1960s and early 1970s and found all over the world, including in the United States. They generate electricity by circulating water through their infernally hot cores, converting it to steam that is used to turn turbine generators. Each reactor has three containers set one inside another like Russian nesting dolls. The smallest container, a steel capsule about the length of a tennis court, is called the reactor pressure vessel. That’s where the nuclear fission reaction takes place, powered by fuel composed of uranium dioxide baked into ceramic pellets. This capsule is enclosed inside a primary containment vessel, a concrete and steel structure shaped like a massive light bulb, designed to capture any radiation that might accidentally escape. The containment vessel in turn is housed inside the reactor building, a concrete and metal rectangle that offers only minimal protection from radiation. Technicians in protective gear can work for short periods inside the reactor building, but they can’t enter the far more radioactive containment vessel, which is where they were likely to find at least some of the missing fuel. Building a robot that could get inside and maneuver around the containment vessel presented several unique challenges. First, the containment vessel was only practically accessible through a 5.5-inch circular maintenance opening about 8 feet above the floor of the reactor building, so the robot would have to be small. Second, because the containment vessel had been pumped full of water to cool it down, the robot would have to be able to swim. Third, since the water and thick walls would defeat wireless signals, this small, swimming robot would need to be powerful enough to move under­water while dragging as much as 65 yards of electric cable behind it. It took months of research, experimentation, and testing in Toshiba’s labs and in an enormous simulation tank at the government-run Port and Airport Research Institute to balance all these capabilities inside the little machine. Matsuzaki’s team had to try different configurations of propellers, cameras, and sensors, boost the power of the propeller motors, develop a new type of coating to make the cable move more smoothly, and ensure the whole package could withstand a blistering level of radiation. Simulation facility at the Naraha Remote Technology Development Center. At midnight on July 19, the day the Sunfish was scheduled to make its first foray into the reactor, Matsuzaki’s alarm went off in his hotel room. He and his team were staying in Iwaki, the closest habitable city with a hotel, about an hour south of the plant. Starting their day in the dark of night was the only way to have enough time to drive to the plant, suit up in protective gear, and hold a last round of meetings before their start time. That would give them about eight hours; by noon it would be too hot inside the reactor building for the technicians monitoring the robot to do their jobs. At about 4:30 am, a group of Toshiba techs in full protective gear darted into the reactor building. They fast-walked to the outer wall of the containment vessel and climbed a step ladder up to the opening where the Sunfish and its equipment had been pre-positioned. They unsealed the valve over the opening, then pushed in a heavy guiding pipe, with the Sunfish at its tip, all the way through to the other side. Slowly and carefully, they angled the pipe until the bot slid into the water below. Inside, it was completely dark. On their monitors in the control room, Matsuzaki’s team, connected to the Sunfish’s controls via the electric cable, could see only a narrow swath cut through the turbid water by the Sunfish’s lights. Seated at a long table, one technician “drove” the Sunfish with a videogame-­type controller. Another reeled its cable in and out, keeping it taut so it wouldn’t get tangled as the bot swam this way and that. A third did his best to estimate the machine’s position using a 3-D software model of the containment vessel. Matsuzaki oversaw them all, trying to forget about the platoon of corporate officials watching over his shoulder. The Sunfish had to be able to swim (right), fit into the small opening of the containment vessel (top left), and withstand challenges that crippled an earlier robot, the Scorpion (bottom left). The first day, the Sunfish spent most of its time reconnoitering. The damage inside the containment vessel was worse than expected. Unidentifiable clumps of pebble-sized debris and pieces of half-destroyed equipment littered the floor. But there was no sign of the fuel, and after eight hours of searching, the team pulled the Sunfish back to the surface. They gave it a rest the next day while they discussed their findings and strategized their next steps. The following morning, they sent the Sunfish back into the water. The team drove it slowly and carefully, but time after time, the bot’s powerful propellers would stir up a blinding cloud of sediment, forcing them to wait until the water cleared again. After several hours of maneuvering, and with the noon deadline looming, Matsuzaki was growing nervous. Then, something startling appeared on the monitors. “What is that?” said Matsuzaki. Everyone began talking at once and pointing to what they saw on the screens: murky glimpses of what appeared to be stalactites of something dripping like candle wax from the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel. They’d found the first signs of the missing fuel. They maneuvered the Sunfish around the area, documenting as much as possible, before pulling the bot out. When Matsuzaki declared the mission complete, the control room burst into applause. Kenji Matsuzaki, the lead scientist behind Little Sunfish. By now, much of Fukushima Daiichi itself, an expansive complex covering some 860 acres, is a lot safer than you’d expect. Most areas have been decontaminated to the point where full bodysuits are no longer required. The 5,000-plus workers tasked with cleaning the place up have cut down hundreds of the cherry trees that used to enliven the grounds, torn up and paved over once-grassy open areas, and scrubbed down buildings. They have covered the seafloor just off the coast with clay to seal in cesium that seeped into the mud after the disaster. Using an enormous, purpose-built fuel-handling machine, they have removed the hundreds of spent uranium fuel rods from Unit 4, a reactor that was damaged by an explosion but did not melt down. Still, when I visited the site last December with Lake Barrett, Tepco’s American consultant, we had to put on gloves, safety glasses, surgical masks, three pairs of socks, and plastic booties over our shoes, as well as a personal radiation detector, before being allowed inside the facility. At 72, Barrett is tall, fit, and astonishingly energetic. I first met him at the Narita airport outside Tokyo, where he bounced right off a 20-hour trip from his home in Florida, joined me in a car without stopping for so much as a cup of coffee, and talked cheerily for the entire two-hour drive to Fukushima prefecture. When Barrett heard the first news reports about the disaster, he “didn’t think much of it,” he says. “There’s always so much hype around these things.” Then he saw the picture of Unit 1 exploding. “I said, ‘Holy shit. I know exactly what that was.’ I knew they were in deep doo-doo.” When the call came to help out, he didn’t hesitate. “It’s personal for me,” he says. “Japan was the only country that helped us at Three Mile Island. We owe Japan.” Inside the Fukushima plant, each of these blue towers holds 100 personal radiation detectors. From atop a small hill, once covered with grass and now encased in concrete, Barrett and I survey the trio of hulking buildings outlined against the blues of the winter sky and the Pacific Ocean behind them. Remotely operated orange-and-white cranes lean over them like reverent metal giraffes. These are the reactor buildings: the intractable core of the disaster zone, the radioactive redoubts the robots must penetrate. Each poses a unique challenge. The amount and type of damage inflicted on each is different, as is the depth of the water flooding their bases. Of course, at the heart of each is a mess of melted fuel, presumed to have flowed in different ways to different places. Less than half a mile from these three reactors sits Unit 5, one of the three other reactors that had been shut down for regular maintenance when the tsunami hit. Since it escaped largely unscathed and is nearly identical to the damaged reactors, Tepco engineers use it to plan robot missions. Inside is a baffling maze of machines, ducts, cables, and catwalks. “You can see how hard it is to run the robots around in here,” Barrett says. We navigate our way through the building to the containment vessel. “That’s just like where the Sunfish went in,” he says, pointing up to an unassuming circular opening in the wall of the vessel. We enter the containment vessel and make our way through a narrow doorway into a chamber below the reactor pressure vessel. Control rod assemblies stud the reactor vessel’s underside; we have to crouch to avoid bumping our heads on them. Pointing out key areas and components, Barrett walks me through the current theories on what happened to the fuel in each of the meltdown units. “No one knows if the lava made a nice neat vertical pile or whether it flowed sideways,” he says. “Hot molten fuel could have fallen into the water and caused a steam explosion that would have blown it everywhere.” In Unit 3, at least, thanks to the Sunfish, Tepco is relatively certain about a few things. The pictures it took show that the control-rod mechanisms at the bottom of the reactor vessel disintegrated. Molten fuel mixed with melted metal dripped down through the openings they left behind, presumably creating the stalactites seen in the videos. The lava-like mixture burned through both the steel grate beneath the reactor pressure vessel and a refrigerator-sized machine used to insert the control rods, and some of it dripped down to the floor of the containment vessel. There also appear to be chunks of fuel on the vessel’s walls. Inside Unit 3 Each reactor is made up of three containers, one set inside another, that hold critical equipment. 1. Reactor Building: A large concrete and steel structure that acts as the last line of defense to keep radiation from escaping into the outside world. 2. Primary Containment Vessel: An airtight enclosure made of steel and concrete. 3. Reactor Pressure Vessel: A thick steel container that holds the uranium fuel, which powers the nuclear reactor. 4. Control-Rod Drive: A mechanical system that uses thin rods to speed up or slow down a nuclear fission reaction. The rods work by absorbing the stray neutrons that trigger a chain reaction. 5. Pedestal: A circular concrete structure that holds up the reactor. From inside, workers can access the control-rod drive. That still leaves an awful lot unknown. At the end of the day, “how much did we learn from the Sunfish mission?” Barrett asks. “It was a step, not a leap. We’re getting closer and closer, but we have a long, long way to go.” Tepco is continuing its efforts to scout the inside of the reactors. In January, a robotic probe using a remote­-controlled camera mounted on a long pole spotted for the first time what appears to be melted fuel inside Unit 2. There may be another Sunfish mission, though it won’t be the same robot that found the fuel in Unit 3. Despite emerging from the reactor undamaged, it had still absorbed a dangerous amount of radio­activity. Tepco engineers sealed it in a steel cask and interred it with other radioactive waste on the plant site. Limited and uncertain as the Sunfish’s findings are, they have helped move the ball forward. Engineers have now begun thinking about how to build the next generation of robots that will have to carry out the most complicated undertaking of all: removing the melted fuel. Their first challenge will be enabling the bots to reach their target. “These are cramped spaces filled with huge pieces of equipment that weigh many tons. You have to cut them up in pieces and pull them out,” Barrett says. One idea currently in favor is to build a massive 20-foot robot arm that would enter the reactor building on rails, reach into the reactor pressure vessel, and scoop up the fuel. Another is to send in a bot the size of a small refrigerator on tractor treads, equipped with cutting and gripping tools to wrangle debris. A second robot would lift the detritus into containers, seal it, and put it on a conveyor belt to the outside. Either system will take years to develop. Either or both might fail. Tepco has pegged 2021 as the target year to begin removing fuel debris. How long might the entire Fukushima cleanup take? “Good question. Nobody knows. No one in human history has experience with this,” says Naoaki Okuzumi, a senior manager with the decommissioning institute. “The government says 30 to 40 years. I think that is optimistic.” While the robots’ work inside Fukushima Dai­ichi drags on, human beings who once lived near the plant are waiting to go home. The national government has decontaminated several towns and urged residents to return. At the time of my visit in December, though, roughly 130 square miles of land was still off-limits, including the better part of a town called Okuma, perched in the hills a few miles from the plant. Yoshihiro Takada, a former resident who now works with the local government agency in charge of rebuilding, agreed to show me around. Takada spent almost his entire life in Okuma and had to escape with his wife, child, and parents when the disaster hit. They’ve relocated to another town 65 miles away. I met up with Takada in a parking lot just outside the exclusion zone, where we put on full-body Tyvek suits, face masks, gloves, socks, and booties over our shoes to protect us from the particles of cesium and strontium. Inhaling even a dust speck of one of those isotopes can be dangerous. That’s part of what makes radiation so terrifying : You can’t feel it, see it, or smell it. It can kill you without you ever knowing you encountered it. A few miles from the Fukushima plant, in the town of Okuma, visitors must wear full-body Tyvek suits, face masks, gloves, socks, and booties when walking along the abandoned streets. The desolation of the exclusion zone, in the town of Okuma. There was no one in the train station, the barbershop, the restaurants, or the stores. The modest houses and apartment buildings on the residential streets were all empty. The only sound I heard as we walked down the middle of the deserted main street was the chirping of clueless birds who didn’t realize they’d chosen to nest in a radioactive hot zone. “I remember this place—their pizza was so good,” Takada says, gesturing at a shuttered restaurant as we walk through town. Several shop windows have been smashed by wild boar that have come down from the hills to ransack the deserted town for food. Cars sit in driveways half-hidden by overgrown weeds. Takada only occasionally checks in on his own house. “Rats are running all over it inside. There are droppings and garbage all over,” he says. The area around Fukushima is mostly scenic farmland fringed with thickly wooded hills. But drive along practically any road and you pass fields filled with rows and rows of boulder-sized, black polypropylene bags. They are filled with contaminated earth; as part of the cleanup, a layer of topsoil is being scraped up from gardens, schoolyards, and fields all across the region. Roughly 20 million of the bags are scattered around the prefecture. Many of them will eventually be moved to the outskirts of Fukushima Daiichi itself for indefinite storage, along with an ever-growing array of tanks holding the radioactive water Tepco continues to pump out of the reactors. Ultimately, there is no technology that can simply fix what happened at Fukushima. The only certainty is that it will be a slow, incremental, frustrating process that may not even be completed in Kenji Matsuzaki’s lifetime. For now, all the scientists, engineers, and their allies can do is keep the radioactivity under control, track down its source, and try to capture it. But first, they need to create the robots to do it. Radioactive waste at the Tomioka contaminated waste facility. It will be buried for 200 years.

Aimée Lutkin,"On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by an earthquake of 7.5-magnitude, followed by a 20 foot tsunami. More than 1,200 deaths have been confirmed, and the city of Palu needs help. There are a number of ways to donate, but according to the New York Times, money is a much more immediate way to help rather than canned goods, water, or clothes. Its very easy for those items to be misplaced. NPR reports that the scale of the disaster was at first difficult to determine, because communications were knocked out. The U.N. is now estimating that 1.6 million have been or will be affected in the coming recovery. The NYT and NPR suggest ed a number of organizations you can send money to who have people on the ground (to make sure it gets where it needs to go). GlobalGiving This group focuses on local organizations and currently have a goal of $1 million to help people in Sulawesi. They focus on emergency supplies first, then long-term recovery assistance. CARE CARE is also focusing on immediate needs north of Palu and towards the center of the cityespecially clean drink water, sanitation and shelter.Their county director in Indonesia, Helen Vanwel, told NPR that its a difficult project, because access is limited. A landslide has blocked the main road into Palu, flights are restricted into the airport, there is a destruction of major seaports and a general lack of communication, she said. Indonesian Red Cross According to the group, theyve mobilized 70 tons of supplies, including baby kits, mattresses and tents as well as water trucks and 15 ambulances. They say they have 179 staffers in the area already. Humanity &amp; Inclusion This organization has been in Indonesia since 2005. The theme continues to be working on immediate relief, especially medical care and psychosocial support. Save the Children There are Save the Children volunteers in Palu who are trying to establish temporary shelters from ropes and tarps, and also clearing away areas for children to safely play, because kids continue to need some normalcy and freedom when their worlds are turned upside down. UNICEF This group is also working on clean water by bringing in a mobile water treatment facility. Theyve also been working with local authorities to find the families of children who were separated from them during the disaster. The Jakarta Post also shared a few groups that are much more local, and shared a message from the National Disaster Mitigation Agency saying things like fuel (diesel fuel and gasoline), drinking water, medical personnel, medicines and field hospitals, tents, tarps, blankets, stretchers, water tanks, food, lamps, generator sets, emergency kitchens, body bags, shrouds and baby food were all needed. They also boosted the Indonesian Red Cross as an option for immediate relief. Aksi Cepat Tanggap (ACT Indonesia) ACT Indonesia as been around since 2005 as well, and are extremely transparent with their money. You can also follow them on Twitter at @ACTforHumanity to stay up to date on how things are changing on the ground.","On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by an earthquake of 7.5-magnitude, followed by a 20 foot tsunami.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","A magnitude 7.0 earthquake shook Anchorage and the surrounding area on Friday morning. The shaking also triggered a wave of tsunami warnings along the Alaska coast with more likely around the Pacific. The strongest of a series of quakes struck just after 8:30 a.m. local time about 8 miles north of Anchorage. Numerous strong aftershocks continue to jolt the region, with Alaskas Earthquake Center tweeting that many more are expected. In the immediate aftermath, reports on social media indicated there are power outages, collapsed overpasses, fires, and sinkholes, though as with all disasters, its worth waiting to hear more official information. The earthquake also triggered a tsunami warning for Cook Inlet and the Southern Kenai Peninsula. For other US and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America, the level of tsunami danger is being evaluated, the U.S. Tsunami Warning System said in a bulletin. The warning has caused widespread gridlock as Alaskans fled the coast while navigating roads that have reportedly been damaged by the shaking. Alaska is no stranger to earthquakes, with its southeastern coastline sitting on the edge of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. The state recorded the strongest earthquake in North American history in 1964. That magnitude 9.2 earthquake caused widespread damage and unleashed tsunami waves across the Pacific, including one that reached an astounding 200 feet in height as it funneled. This quake wasnt nearly as strong so any tsunami is unlikely to reach that level, but this is still a dangerous situation and should be monitored closely if you live anywhere across the Pacific.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Early this morning, NOAA’s National Tsunami Warning Center issued tsunami warnings for the south coast of Alaska and British Columbia, after a powerful, magnitude 7.9 earthquake rocked the Gulf of Alaska. Tsunami watches were issued for California, Oregon, and Washington State. A few hours later, all watches and warnings had been canceled, leading many Twitter users still-half asleep at their computers to wonder: Why is it so damn hard to predict a tsunami’s strength ahead of time? The reason has to do with the fact that the ocean is very large, and our earthquake and tsunami monitoring infrastructure is relatively limited. As geophysicist Mika McKinnon explained to Earther, a tsunami did arrive, and we predicted its timing pretty damn well. The thing that was—and always is—difficult to predict is the tsunami’s size. “It’s easy to predict when a tsunami will arrive, it is very difficult to predict how big it is going to be,” McKinnon said. “There is a tsunami right now, it just happens to be under a foot tall.” To understand why, it’s useful to start at the source of the event. Tsunamis are essentially massive ripples, emanating out from an area where water was displaced. Think throwing a stone in a pond, only now, the stone is a meteorite the size of a bus, or an undersea volcanic eruption. Or, in this case, a large earthquake. All of these events displace water, creating ripples. Trouble is, it’s very difficult to tell how much water. “How can you tell how the displacement of water was distributed?” McKinnon said. “You’re not going to be able to measure it in the open ocean, where the distance above background is a few inches over a few kilometers. You have to wait for the wave to come to shore and shoal,” the process by which tsunami waves bunch up on shore, the crest-to-crest distance becoming shorter as the height of the wave grows taller. That said, tsunami forecasters aren’t entirely in the dark. McKinnon explained that after an earthquake occurs, the event is thrown into a tsunami modeling system, which gives “a good estimate on travel time.” To determine if a tsunami wave is going to propagate widely, forecasters then turn to the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) network, a series of ocean buoys maintained by NOAA that detect the pressure of waves from a passing tsunami. “People regularly die at this stage in a tsunami.” A series of graphics tweeted out by the National Weather Service Tsunami Alert Center this morning show the location of those DART buoys relative to the recent quake, and predicted arrival times for the tsunami wave. Looking at the prediction maps tweeted out over the last few hours, you can see that arrival times don’t change very much—again, the speed of a tsunami, which depends largely on the depth of the ocean, is something we’re quite good at predicting: The final piece of the puzzle for understanding a tsunami event is tide gauges (those orange dots on the Tsunami Alert maps), which measure ocean surface displacement near the shore. It isn’t until we have that tide gauge data—plus any human observations—that we can really say how big the tsunami event is going to be. Tsunamis look different from the normal ebb and flow of the tide. As the National Weather Service explains, when they come ashore they move like a “fast-rising flood or a wall of water.” Another tell is if the water drains away suddenly, exposing the ocean floor and appearing like a very low tide. Powerful tsunamis that cause large changes to the water level can lead to flooding over a mile inland, according to the NWS. Sometimes, as was the case this morning, we get lucky and tsunami events are minor. But it’s important to note that even if a tsunami generates little flooding, it can still be deadly. Monster waves or no, tsunamis carry a lot of energy. Plus, the first wave isn’t necessarily the largest one, and depending on the bathymetry of the shoreline, waves can pile up and become bigger in certain locations. (Bays can funnel water in, causing waves to interfere constructively and get taller.) That’s where human reports are very useful, but in the case of this morning’s tsunami, such reports were few and far between. Fact of the matter is, there just aren’t that many people living on the south coast of Alaska. Given the complexity of the situation, McKinnon said it’s a good idea to stay out of the water for a few hours after a tsunami warning is lifted. “People regularly die at this stage in a tsunami,” McKinnon said. “They get in the water because it looks like a normal surf, and there are really intense currents and they die.”","Early this morning, NOAA’s National Tsunami Warning Center issued tsunami warnings for the south coast of Alaska and British Columbia, after a powerful, magnitude 7.9 earthquake rocked the Gulf of Alaska.

Rachel Kraus,"The weather site whose slogan is ""welcome to superior accuracy"" just sent out a false tsunami warning to its users. On Tuesday morning, the National Weather Service (NWS) sent out what they're calling a routine test message for their tsunami warning system. SEE ALSO: Worker who sent Hawaii's false alarm believed there really was a missile attack But AccuWeather's automated scanning and dissemination of the NWS alert apparently missed the ""test"" portion of the message. So people on the East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and in the Caribbean, who receive push alerts from AccuWeather, started their Tuesday with a freaking tsunami warning. If users clicked on the message, they would see it was a test. But the push alert itself gave no indication that this was anything less than a giant wave coming to wreck multiple states across the U.S. AccuWeather quickly communicated on Twitter that the message was a test. They also had some harsh words for the NWS, characterizing the message as something they simply ""passed on"" to the public. They place the blame with the NWS for not communicating clearly enough in the message sent to AccuWeather, crawled by their coding, that it was a test. ""AccuWeather has the most sophisticated system for passing on NWS tsunami warnings based on a complete computer scan of the codes used by the NWS. While the words ""TEST"" were in the header, the actual codes read by computers used coding for real warning, indicating it was a real warning,"" read the statement.

No Tsunami warning is in effect for the East Coast of the U.S. — AccuWeather (@accuweather) February 6, 2018 The NWS also clarified on Twitter and in a statement that there was no tsunami warning in effect. But they seemed to lay the blame at the feet of private companies like AccuWeather, noting that they never intended their test to be sent to the public at all. ***THERE IS NO TSUNAMI WARNING*** A Tsunami Test was conducted earlier this morning, that did have TEST in the message.

We're currently looking into why the test message was distributed by at least one private sector company, and will provide more information as soon as we have it."" According to the National Weather Service Key West, Tuesday's test was identical to past tests, which are sent out monthly. They have not caused false alerts in the past.

George Dvorsky,"Many prehistoric mass graves located along coastlines around the world may be linked to ancient tsunamis, new research suggests. Mass graves are common in the archaeological record. There’s the Viking-age Ridgeway Hill Burial Pit in the UK, for example, which contains 54 skeletons and 51 dismembered heads, or the Early Neolithic mass grave of Schöneck-Kilianstädten in Germany, a likely massacre that resulted in the deaths of at least 26 people. In these and similar cases, archaeologists attribute the burials to warfare or pillaging, as evidenced by wounds such as blunt-force trauma, injuries caused by weapons, or decapitations. But in some cases, where the cause of death isn’t obvious, and where no written or oral history exists to explain the presence of a mass grave, archaeologists can only speculate as to the cause. New research published in the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory suggests scientists have overlooked a possible cause of some ambiguous mass graves located along oceanic coastlines: ancient tsunamis. Study co-author James Goff from the PANGEA Research Centre at UNSW Sydney says tsunamis are rarely, if ever, considered as explanations for burial sites, which may explain why no prehistoric mass graves have been identified as being tsunami-related. “Proving that a site is related to a past tsunami could lead to a fundamental rewrite of how we interpret coastal human settlement in prehistory, and change what we thought we knew about the culture and people living in the region at the time,’ said Goff in a statement. “It could also have dramatic implications for how archaeologists analyze a site.” For the study, Goff and his colleagues considered mass burial sites located around the world, including the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu (both located in the Pacific Ocean and in areas prone to tsunamis), and the Orkney and Shetland islands (located north of Scotland in a relatively inactive tectonic region where a link to tsunamis hasn’t been considered). These graves ranged in age from 5,000 to 500 years ago. “We already know that tsunamis have occurred in all the areas that we explored in this study, and the ages for mass burials match those of the geological evidence for past events,” said Goff. “Looking at the evidence from the burial sites considering the potential of tsunamis, we were able to make a strong case for many of these sites being related to major tsunamis, as opposed to more standard explanations like warfare or an epidemic.” Take a mass grave found in the Solomon Islands. Archaeologists have documented over 200 individual burials, in which the bodies were placed next to each other and covered in coral gravel, requiring virtually no digging. The bodies were laid on their backs, with their arms placed straight down the body. Some individuals exhibited signs of exposure, such as gnawed limbs (likely from rats, dogs, or pigs). Many of the victims died when they were fairly young, averaging about 26 years in age. Virtually no signs were present to indicate differences in social status or wealth. In sum, the burials exhibited “a general sense of disorganization,” as the researchers noted in their study. Taken together, the unorthodox method of the burial, along with the uncharacteristically young age of the victims, is consistent with what would be expected after a tsunami. This suggestion is hardly outlandish. Coastal communities are common in the archaeological record, with early humans subsisting off of marine food resources. Also, recent tsunamis in the Indian Ocean and Japan have demonstrated the power of tsunamis to produce deaths en masse. After the Indian Ocean tsunami, for example, as many as 60,000 to 70,000 victims were buried in Banda Aceh alone. Both now and in the past, survivors had to create mass graves and bury the dead without engaging in the usual funeral customs; leaving the bodies in the open to rot, or to picked away by scavengers, is not and was not an option. Finally, given the prevalence of ancient coastal communities and the frequency of tsunamis, it seems odd that archaeologists haven’t identified a single tsunami-related mass grave. As Goff and his colleagues argue, that’s because the cause of these mass graves are being overlooked. “Our archaeological research in conjunction with geological evidence recognises that exactly what has happened in modern events must have happened in the past,” said Goff. “This line of analysis will hopefully start being at the forefront of researchers’ minds when excavating a coastal mass burial.” To be clear, the researchers aren’t saying that every prehistoric mass burial along the coast is related to a tsunami. Rather, they’re simply asking archaeologists to reconsider and re-evaluate ancient mass graves found in coastal contexts. The authors present various methods for doing so. Geological, chemical, and biological analyses can be performed to identify the location and timing of ancient tsunami events, such as the identification of inland sedimentary layers consistent with a tsunami, signs of erosion, saltwater signatures found inland, and microfossil evidence, among many other signatures. But there’s another technique, one proposed in the new study. “When people die in a tsunami, they inhale saltwater that contains small marine microorganisms called diatoms, which means they suffocate and then drown,” Genevieve Cain, the lead author of the new study and a researcher at the University of Oxford, said in a statement. “These diatoms travel through the bloodstream and are deposited and preserved within the bone marrow of larger bones. If we can find marine diatoms, this may indicate that the body is a tsunami victim.” Looking ahead, this team of researchers is hoping to do exactly that, and analyze the skeletal remains of victims found in coastal mass burial sites around the world.

Alessandra Potenza,"Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska, prompting a tsunami warning that forced people to flee to higher grounds in the middle of the night. Fortunately, the tsunami waves were less than a foot high, and the advisories were canceled a little after 4AM local time. So why was Alaska so lucky? Powerful quakes that happen out at sea are known to cause destructive tsunamis. In 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake in northeastern Japan triggered waves as high as 126 feet, killing nearly 20,000 people. In 2004, a similarly strong quake off the coast of Indonesia caused a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people. Alaska also has a history of strong earthquakes: in 1964, the state experienced the most powerful quake ever recorded in the US, a 9.2 magnitude tremor followed by a tsunami that killed over 100 people. “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes,” says Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey (USGS). “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes.” Earthquakes occur because the Earth’s crust is divided into plates. These plates can move smoothly against each other or become stuck. When they become stuck, they build up strain over time, until one day, the plates unstick, releasing energy that causes an earthquake. Just south of Alaska, the Pacific plate is sliding underneath the North American plate, an area called the subduction zone. That’s why the state is highly seismic, Blakeman tells The Verge. Last night’s earthquake generated because of all the strain building up on the subduction zone, but it did not occur exactly on a fault where the Pacific Ocean seafloor is sliding under the North American plate, Blakeman says. Instead, the quake occurred a little farther out, in a place where the fault is moving horizontally. This type of quake, called a strike-slip earthquake, is less likely to trigger large tsunamis, and this is probably why Alaska only saw waves of less than a foot, according to Blakeman. When earthquakes happen on the subduction zone itself, where one plate is pushing down while the other is going up, then high waves form. “To get a tsunami, you have to have substantial vertical movement on the seabed,” Blakeman says. Those types of earthquakes were responsible for the massive tsunamis in Japan and Indonesia. Aftershocks in Alaska could continue for weeks or months, Blakeman says. If the quakes generate from the same zone as last night, then large tsunamis should not be expected. But because the state sits by the Pacific-North America plate boundary, it’s normal that new earthquakes will happen in the future. When and where, exactly? That’s impossible to say. Earthquakes are so complicated that scientists aren’t able to predict them — at least not yet. “Since we can’t predict them, all we can do is be prepared,” Blakeman says.","Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska.",2018-01-23T16:15:13Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",A powerful earthquake in Alaska didn’t trigger a big tsunami — here’s why,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16922914/alaska-earthquake-tsunami-pacific-north-america-plate-boundary,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQqh3BMKCmEiuTLq3ign4Cnb9ag=/0x97:704x466/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10082687/earthquake.png,the-verge,The Verge,tsunami,1

Natasha Lomas,"The style transfer craze kicked off by an app called Prisma a couple of years ago led to a tsunami of painterly selfies flooding social feeds for several months, as we reported at the time, before the rapacious, face-snapping hoards shifted their attention toward fresh spectacles. But that’s not the end of the story.
The same tech is now creeping into (paper) kids’ books, via a partnership between children’s publisher startup, Kabook, and Prisma Labs: aka the b2b entity that the original app makers pivoted to in late 2017.
So instead of AI sending robots into a human-slaying frenzy, per the usual dystopian sci-fi storyline, we find ourselves confronted with neural nets being used to serve up contextual illustrations of children so parents can gift personalized books that seamlessly insert a child’s likeness into the story, thereby casting them as a character in the tale.
Not the end of the world then. Well, not unless you view this kind of self-centered content manipulation as a threat to children’s imaginations and developing sense of empathy. (The research on any ‘little princes in training’ will, unfortunately, have to wait a few decades to come through though.)
The Kabook integration is the first consumer product partnership that Prisma Labs has scored, according to a press release from the pair.
And while they note there are other publishing services that offer the chance to insert a bit of custom text and photography into a book they claim their collaboration is the only publishing technology that does this “seamlessly”, i.e. thanks to the AI’s style blending fingers.
We are excited to be able to work directly with the team at Kabook! to create a truly unique user experience; one that has offered young readers a completely personalized way to enjoy reading, said Andrey Usoltsev, CEO of Prisma Labs, in a statement.
Part of our mission at Prisma Labs is to develop new ways for people to express their emotions through digital creations, and through this partnership with Kabook! we are able to take that one step further and bring that to life on the pages of an actual book.
Kabook, which was set up last year — describing itself as “a technology-based” children’s book publisher, with a focus on kids aged 0-7 years — is currently offering four stories that can be personalized with a kid’s AI-generated likeness.
Three of the books incorporate just one custom image into the story. While a fourth, called Hornswoggled!, makes uses of seven photos in a pirate-themed buried treasure adventure. 
The personalized stories start at $24.99 per book, with hard and soft cover versions available.","The style transfer craze kicked off by an app called Prisma a couple of years ago led to a tsunami of painterly selfies flooding social feeds for several months, as we reported at the time, before the rapacious, face-snapping hoards shifted their attention to…",2019-01-17T15:20:15Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Prisma’s style transfer tech creeps into kids’ books,http://techcrunch.com/2019/01/17/prismas-style-transfer-tech-creeps-into-kids-books/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kabook-Image1.jpg?w=514,techcrunch,TechCrunch,tsunami,1

Navigation systems are guiding out-of-towners to vistas that once were known only to a select few, resulting in chaos on once quiet and secluded streets — in neighborhoods that people tend to move to get away from it all — and pressure on public officials. A report by a consulting firm, Dixon Resources Unlimited, ordered by David Ryu, the City Council member who represents the neighborhood, looked at some ideas that have been floating out there, including a tramway to take people to the site. But the more novel idea is to build a replica Hollywood sign that would face north toward Burbank, almost back-to-back with the one that now looks over the Los Angeles basin. “This would give the city the opportunity to promote the replica sign viewpoints as more accessible locations for photos than in the residential neighborhoods south of the park,” the report said. The idea has its drawbacks. “One downside of this strategy is that it would take away from the history of the original Hollywood sign,” it says.

Adam Rogers,"The mudslides earlier this week that killed 17 people—eight more remain missing—came as a terrifying surprise in the early morning to the enclaves of Montecito and Summerland, nestled into the California coastline just southeast of Santa Barbara. But in most respects, they were also entirely predictable—and predicted. The Thomas Fire, the largest wildfire in California history, burned almost 450 square miles of the Santa Ynez mountains in late December, a swath of steep, rocky chaparral as big as San Antonio. Then the rains came, a massive winter storm after almost a year of drought. This is the climatic and geomorphological history of the transverse ranges, the “fire-flood cycle”—as a scientific journal article named it in 1935. The mountains of Southern California burn and then liquefy with terrifying regularity, and, yes, more often than they used to thanks in some measure to climate change and increased human development. Only now, science is starting to catch up to the cycle—to understand how it works and predict when it will be at its worst. And those scientific insights are coming just in time for more and more people to build more and more houses at the feet of those eternally liquefying mountains. In one sense the mudslides—what geologists more properly call “debris flows,” because they contain both water and a diversity of stuff, from ash to houses—have always been predictable. Wildfires are getting more common, and wildfires make mountainsides more likely to give way. With vegetation burned away, roots that held underlying soil together are gone, and the cover that a canopy might have provided against rain vanishes as well. In Southern California’s chaparral biome, that vegetation adds another factor. Those shrubs and low, waxy plants are adapted to fires every few decades. Their drought tolerance comes in part from a resin-like coat on their leaves that helps retain moisture. But fire volatilizes that wax, which then coats the soil and ash left behind. “You develop these hydrophobic soils,” says Francis Rengers, a geomorphologist on the US Geological Survey’s Post-Wildfire Debris Flow Team. “Water that normally would hit the ground and soak in, because soil is porous, now it’s the soil and it’s like you put a raincoat on the landscape.” Dump enough rain onto that coat, though, and it penetrates, and that hydrophobicity can enhance erosion. Even the geology of Southern California’s mostly east-west mountain ranges makes debris flows more likely. The region’s frequent earthquakes—what, you want fires and mudslides to be the only disasters?—are evidence of “active tectonics.” Which is to say, those mountain ranges are growing boys and girls, always getting taller and steeper. More steep equals more likely to slide. The rock itself is, geologically speaking, “shattered”—above Montecito, where the Thomas-related slides were, it’s sedimentary and metasedimentary rock, much more likely to erode than, say, Yosemite granite. “It’s rock that’s loose and available to move,” Rengers says. So these SoCal debris flows are, quite literally, the stuff of literature. The great science journalist John McPhee wrote about them in “Los Angeles Against the Mountains” in 1988, and TC Boyle picked up on the terror of it all in his 2005 short story “La Conchita.” “A vanguard of boulders came sluicing across the freeway, followed by a soupy river of mud. A rock the size of a cannonball thumped into the underside of the U-Haul truck and a fistful of pellets—gravel, I guess—sprayed the side of my car,” Boyle writes. “The mud spread out across the pavement, seething around the tires and underneath the car and beyond, and soon dark tongues of it had pushed across the southbound lanes, too.” It’s good writing because it’s right. “The debris starts out in a loose state and gets agitated as it goes downhill. As it mixes with water, it attains a liquefied state that allows it to flow almost as readily as water, even though it’s charged with boulders and debris,” says Richard Iverson, a hydrologist with the US Geological Survey. “The leading edge is chock-full of the largest debris, and that part has a lot of resistance. So what you get is a more liquefied, fluid part pushing that resistive front forward, but because you have the front it can become much deeper.” In other words, the leading edge of a debris flow is a moving dam, a wave of destruction that accretes yet more ammunition as it oozes forward as fast as 10 miles per hour, like the parade in Satoshi Kon’s Paprika —a “bouldery snout,” as Susan Cannon and Jerry DeGraff wrote in 2009, “followed by a more viscous body that transitions to a very muddy water flow.” The big stuff in the front acts like a bulldozer, the pressure of the muck causes even more damage, and the water can literally float cars off the ground and buildings off their foundations. “Down a steep canyon, the debris flow will be getting bigger and bigger,” Iverson says. “Once it hits flatter terrain or can spread out onto an alluvial fan or into a neighborhood, then it slows down and quits growing.” Fortunately, in recent years geologists have gotten better and better at predicting which slopes are likely to slide after fires, based on computer models using data from previous flows. So for example, Rengers’ team starts with satellite images of burned areas, comparing the green-ness of before images to the blackness of the afters to develop burn severity maps. “That’s called a normalized burn ratio image,” Rengers says. “It’s a quantifiable signal.” To that, they add soil erodibility data from onsite examination and the National Resources Conservation Service, the soil division of the US Department of Agriculture, combined with information on the steepness of the slopes that burned. “Areas with high burn severity, steep slopes, and high erodibility have the highest probabilities for where debris flows will originate,” Rengers says. And in fact, his group’s map of debris flow hazards shows the hills above Montecito and Summerland as having a very high probability of sliding. The area was under evacuation orders before Tuesday. It just needed one more ingredient: Rain. And that happened, too. “For the Santa Barbara County-Ventura area, it takes about a half an inch of rain in one hour for debris flows to occur,” Rengers says. “What we saw in the Montecito area was that there was a half inch of rain in five minutes.” So it was a coincidental catastrophe. Chaparral starts to grow back within months; the rains came just weeks after fire crews got the Thomas Fire under control. I drove through that part of the state two weeks ago, and the hillsides were black. “It was a really low probability rainfall event, like a 0.5 percent chance,” Rengers says. “That kind of explains the big response.” What researchers like Iverson and Rengers don’t yet know how to predict is what kind of damage a debris flow will do and where it’ll go. The flatter land between the mountains and the sea, packed with buildings, is in its way more chaotic terrain than the hillsides and canyons. The question is, how far will a debris flow spread? “Once something comes out of the canyon and gets routed down streets and between houses, it becomes challenging to track the momentum and deceleration of the flow,” Rengers says. “We’re pretty confident we understand the physics, but the parameter values, like how much debris should we estimate? What water ratio? It’s almost impossible.” It’s all under active research; people from Rengers’ group are in Southern California already, flying planes over the area and taking measurements. Iverson’s group is working on models for the potentially city-killing debris flows that could conceivably come off of Mount Rainier in Washington. Fire researchers and geologists know a few things for sure: The 2018 fire season starts in about nine months. The cycle starts again. And what’s true in California is increasingly true everywhere. Fires are more likely to start in the built environment, along the wildland-urban interface where human beings live, and more human beings live there than ever before. Climate change means warmer springs and summers, and possibly increases in precipitation as well. Then the rains will come, and mountainsides will flow like water again.","Scientists are learning how to predict deadly mudslides. (After fires, when enough rain comes.)

Andrew Freedman,"A magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck about 170 miles southeast of Kodiak, Alaska early Tuesday morning, sending residents of the picturesque island fleeing to higher ground to avoid tsunami waves. The quake also prompted tsunami alerts along the West Coast of the U.S. and Hawaii, but those were canceled after data showed damaging waves were not expected. Since the first quake hit there have been several aftershocks, some of which have been strong earthquakes themselves, with a magnitude of up to 5.3 on the Richter Scale. Reports indicated water fluctuating by up to 1 foot in a channel that feeds into Kodiak Harbor, but no large, damaging waves.

The magnitude 7.9 earthquake occurred along a ""strike-slip"" fault, where two plates grind past one another. These earthquakes don't typically give rise to large tsunamis, since they tend to involve horizontal, rather than vertical, motion. This morning's 7.9 earthquake occurred along a strike-slip fault.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Indonesian island of Sulawesi has become a natural disaster zone. After a tsunami battered the island late last week, leaving at least 1,350 dead, a volcano has now erupted. Earlier this week, scientists forecast that Soputan, an active stratovolcano on the northeastern tip of the island, was showing signs of activity. On Wednesday, it sent an ash cloud towering nearly 20,000 feet above its summit. By night, lava was trickling down Soputans flanks. The volcano continues to be on a Level III alert, which is a watch and take precautions kind of alert, but not an evacuations are imminent one. Soputan has erupted a dozen times since 2000, so this isnt wholly a surprise. But it coming right after an earthquake that triggered a tsunami has people wondering if the geological phenomena are intertwined. The short answer: We dont know, but it seems unlikely. It could be that this earthquake triggered the eruption, but the direct correlation has yet to be seen, Kasbani, the head of Indonesias Vulcanology and Geology Disaster Mitigation agency who goes by only one name, said according to NBC News. Denison University volcanologist Erik Klemetti threw even more cold water on the speculation. Soputan had already been restless for months before the earthquake and the volcano is hundreds of kilometers away from the epicenter of the earthquake, he said in an email to Earther. So, I invoke correlation =/= causation on this front. Indonesia is just that geologically active. Indeed, Indonesia is one of the most volcanically active nations in the world. The islands that make up the nation are home to dozens of active volcanoes owing to its proximity the edge of tectonic plates. That can allow magma to seep up from deep in the Earth to the surface more readily. This isnt the first eruption weve seen in Indonesia recently. In February, Mount Sinabung in Sumatra popped off, sending an extremely ominous-looking ash cloud towering over the countryside. Last November, Mount Agung on Bali did its thing, too. Of course, having regular eruptions is one thing. Having one follow a tsunami that already has people on edge is quite another.","The Indonesian island of Sulawesi has become a natural disaster zone.

Bryan Menegus,"At approximately 8:30am today, the National Weather Service sent a test tsunami warning to an unknown number of people. It was not immediately obvious to some that the alert of an impending, destructive force of nature was a test—and at least one-third party app, AccuWeather, reportedly pushed it out as a genuine alert in multiple states. All morning, local NWS Twitter accounts have been trying to reduce the confusion their alert—in conjunction with the genuine panic caused by erroneous warnings from AccuWeather—has caused. Accuweather itself has restated that the NWS alert was a test, but has not clarified why it was not sent out as such by its mobile app. For what it’s worth, Tsunami.gov currently shows two earthquakes on the entire planet, and both are more than two Richter points shy of the 7.5 magnitude usually required to cause a tsunami. Historically, tsunamis almost never hit the East Coast of the US.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"With the tsunami generated so close to Palu, there was little time for people to escape. A tsunami warning was issued by the government and was lifted about half an hour after the quake, apparently after the tsunami hit Palu. Indonesia currently uses only seismographs, global positioning system devices and tide gauges to detect tsunamis, which are of limited effectiveness, said Louise Comfort, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh graduate school. She has been involved in a project to bring new tsunami sensors to Indonesia. In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has a sophisticated network of 39 sensors on the ocean bottom that can detect extremely small pressure changes indicating the passage of a tsunami. The data are then relayed via satellite and analyzed, and an alert is issued if required. Dr. Comfort said that Indonesia had a similar network of 22 sensors but they are no longer in use because they were not being maintained or had been vandalized. The project she is working on would bring a new system to Indonesia that would use undersea communication to avoid the use of surface buoys that could be vandalized or hit by ships.","Catastrophic tsunamis often result from earthquakes that move vertically along a fault.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"By contrast, the fault that ruptured on Friday was a so-called strike-slip fault, in which the earth movement is largely horizontal. That kind of movement would not ordinarily create a tsunami. But under certain circumstances it can, Dr. Patton said. A strike-slip fault might have some amount of vertical motion that could displace seawater. Or the faults rupture zone, which in this case was estimated to be about 70 miles long, may pass through an area where the seafloor rises or drops off, so that when the fault moves during the quake, it pushes seawater in front of it. Another possibility is that the tsunami was created indirectly. The violent shaking during the quake may have caused an undersea landslide that would have displaced water and created waves. Such events are not uncommon; several occurred during the 1964 9.2-magnitude Alaska earthquake, for example. Dr. Patton said a combination of factors may have contributed to the tsunami. Studies of the seafloor will be crucial to understanding the event. We wont know what caused it until thats done, he said.","Catastrophic tsunamis often result from earthquakes that move vertically along a fault.

"Robin George Andrews on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The tsunami that struck Indonesias Sulawesi island and killed at least 1,400 people sadly wont be the last. Human populations will continue to live along coastlines in tectonically active parts of the world, tsunamis will continue to occur, and people will continue to die. That doesnt mean we should just sit back and do nothing about it. As it turns out, there are ways in which we can physically shield ourselves from these fearsome natural outbursts. Here are a just handful, from those that already exist to ideas currently within the realm of science fiction. Build a wall Tsunamismassive waves propagate horizontally through the oceanare triggered by anything that can displace a large volume of water, from certain types of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to landslides. Sea walls, which have been around since at least the time of Ancient Rome, are a popular low-tech option for shielding coastal residents from their destructive power. For some time, Japans tsunami-prone eastern coastline had several small breakwaters along itbarriers designed to protect coastlines from strong wavesas well as similar scale sea walls. Unfortunately, these defenses proved ineffective during the 2011 Thoku tsunami, which killed around 18,000 people. Many have since been replaced with a 245-mile (395-kilometer) long, 41-foot (12.5-meter) high series of concrete walls at the cost of nearly $13 billion. The 2011 tsunami, which reached heights of 128 feet (39 meters) in some areas, would still easily go over that new wall. But in deflecting part of the tsunamis energy, the wall offers some degree of protection. Ultimately any physical barrier can be overtopped, leaving coastal residents in at risk. As Katsu Goda, an associate professor and Canada Research Chair in Multi-Hazard Risk Assessment at Western University put it, if the occupants are below the tsunami wave heights, then their lives will be in significant danger. Kill it at sea Tad Murty, adjunct professor at the University of Ottawa and vice president of the International Tsunami Society, also emphasized that walls only offer partial protection. To achieve total protection, a new idea is emerging in the field. You have to kill the tsunami when its still in the ocean, he told Earther. Tsunamis race horizontally toward the shore like Slinky toys. If that Slinky can be cut up into pieces as its moving, it will weaken and dissipate before it arrives. This, it turns out, can be achieved with well-placed islands. For a natural example of how this can work, take the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. While this event killed hundreds of thousands of people across a wide region, surprisingly few deaths occurred in Kanyakumari in southern India. There, various islands and coral reefs, including the Rama Setu strait, deflected the incoming wave. They broke the tsunami into pieces, Murty said. As China has demonstrated in recent years, building artificial islands isnt too difficult if you have the resources. Each coastline is different, and you would need laboratory experiments and computer simulations to work out the precise placement of islands needed to interrupt an incoming tsunami. But in theory, it could workalthough the idea has yet to be put into practice. Murty said theres some talk of using all the plastic waste in the oceans to build these artificial islands, thereby killing two very different birds with one stone. A very large gun Artificial islands may not be the only tsunami killers well have available in the future. A rather eye-catching 2017 Heliyon paper by Usama Kadri, a lecturer in applied mathematics at Cardiff University, suggested that anti-tsunami cannons could also one day be a reality. Its all about acoustic-gravity waves. These ultra-low frequency sound waves are generated naturally by things like earthquakes, and its already been suggested they could act as early warning signals for the tsunamis. Kadris calculations suggest that we could use acoustic-gravity waves to disrupt tsunamis. By firing strong acoustic-gravity waves back at an incoming wave, we could potentially change its shape, spreading its total energy out over a larger area and reducing its impact on the shore. In theory, these cannons could keep firing until a tsunami is completely dispersed. This isnt possible just yet. A huge amount of energy would be needed to generate necessarily powerful acoustic-gravity waves, and those waves would need to be finely tuned at a moments notice. Describing it as a great engineering challenge, Kadri told Earther that laboratory experiments are in progress that aim to provide a proof-of-concept design. Vertical and floating shelters It will be a long time before coastal populations are able to live free of the fear of a tsunami crashing into them. That means shelters are of vital importance, but certain countries are keener to deploy them than others. Their designs also vary considerably, ranging from hardened, waterproof bunkers to shelters placed on high ground that can keep people inside alive for days or weeks. Murty explained that on much of the Indian coast, thousands of extremely well built, tropical cyclone shelters sit high above the flood line, preventing them from being overwhelmed by surge. Able to accommodate several hundred people, they are used not just for shelter, but as schools, community centers, makeshift hospitals, and more. The United States Pacific seaboard, which will one day be hit by a colossal tsunami, doesnt really have a shelter system like this in place, but things are gradually changing. In 2014, the nations first purpose-built tsunami shelter was built into the school in Washington. The building was reinforced with concrete and steel, and the gym was lifted to the second story, where it can shield 1,000 people from a potent tsunami passing below. This vertical shielding can be seen elsewhere in the world. The Nishiki Tower in Taiki, Japan features a haven on the top floor that will keep 250 people from getting swept up in a tsunami. Post-2011, along parts of countrys eastern coastline, buildings must now be elevated to similar heights. Private companies are building prototypes of shelters, too. One, STATIM Storm, Tornado and Tsunami Interconnected Moduleshas patented a design for a sheter thats essentially a smaller version of Indias cyclone bunkers featuring easy and cheap construction. A key difference here is that although tethered to the ground, these shelters can float and would allow the people inside to literally ride out the waves. Experts all agree that theres far more to saving lives than physical shields and shelters, all of which are only possible if the country has the resources to construct them. Up-to-date, extensive early warning systems, as well as the education of the public, are also vital. And since we cant conquer tsunamis yet, so are effective evacuation measures, which Goda called overall best solution we have to save many people. What I know is that any physical defense could fail, he said.

Steve Dent,"Nissan has been testing the idea of used Leaf batteries for awhile with its Tesla Powerwall-like xStorage program. The idea of using the batteries in an off-grid streetlight, however, is new and appears to be just the start of Nissan's new push into grid and off-grid storage. Much like its alliance-mate Renault, Mercedes and others, Nissan also has a grand plan to use batteries from old and destroyed EVs in several ways. One is for residential homes and buildings that use solar or wind energy, storing energy and releasing it at night or if the power goes out. Another is to use the batteries for ""smart booths"" that could power cellphones and other devices. Finally, Nissan unveiled a whimsical scheme, ""a park converting the bursting energy of children into electricity while they play. Children's energy during the day keeps the park bright and safe at nighttime."" Much like Renault's "" Smart Island,"" Nissan's Light Reborn project is more a small-scale test and way to market its green credentials. Namie, Japan, is a particularly poignant location for a test, as the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant lost power during an earthquake and tsunami, causing a partial meltdown of the core.

Indonesia says it will build a new warning system capable of detecting tsunamis caused by undersea landslides, days after giant waves triggered by a volcano killed at least 429 people.
Installation of the new structure of buoys would start next year, a government agency told the BBC.
It is thought that activity by the Anak Krakatau volcano set off undersea landslides, causing Saturday's tsunami.
Officials say some 150 people are still missing and 16,000 have been displaced.
Rescue workers, helped by heavy lifting equipment, are going from village to village, sifting through the debris looking for survivors in badly hit areas on the islands of Sumatra and Java.
How will the new system work?
The new mechanism would work by detecting the size of waves, Iyan Turyana, a spokesman for the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, told the BBC's Indonesian service. 
The existing technology failed to predict the tsunami that devastated coastal towns around the Sunda Strait, between the islands of Sumatra and Java.
The system has been set up to monitor earthquakes, but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves.
Due to lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults, there has been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012.
But experts say that even if there had been buoys near the volcano, there warning time would have been minimal, given how close Anak Krakatau is to the shoreline.
Coastal residents near the volcano have been warned to keep away from beaches amid fears continued volcanic eruptions of Anak Krakatau could trigger a new tsunami.
What is the situation on the ground?
Rescue efforts have been hampered by blocked roads and heavy rain, the BBC's Sameer Hashmi in Banten reports.
There are concerns that contaminated water could spread diseases, our correspondent adds.
Food, water, blankets and medical aid are slowly reaching remote areas, and thousands of people are in tents and temporary shelters like mosques or schools.
""Everybody is still in a state of panic,"" Atmadja Suhar, official in the city of Labuan, told Reuters news agency. ""We often have disasters, but not as bad as this... God willing we will rebuild.""
The tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake.
The waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations, including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort in west Java.
One of the most shocking and heart-rending stories to have emerged is that of rock band Seventeen, who were performing in the resort when waves came crashing through the stage and swept them away.
How common are tsunamis in Indonesia?

Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim.
In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.
On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.
However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.

Massive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people

The eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945
The eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away
World temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year
The volcanic island virtually disappeared
Anak Krakatau emerged in 1927 from the caldera that was formed during the eruption of Krakatoa

At least 844 people are confirmed to have died in the disaster, but the number is expected to rise as remote areas are reached. The aid and rescue operation is being slowed by damaged infrastructure and continuing strong aftershocks. There are fears some survivors may still be trapped under the rubble. Media caption Tsunami survivor: ""I was hugging my wife, but when the wave came... I immediately lost her"" The bodies of the students were found in the Sigi district, just outside Palu, which was struck by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami on Friday. Aid workers told BBC they were still in the process of retrieving the bodies, and were being hampered by mud. ""The mud conditions in that area are terrible, we have to walk about 1.5 hours to reach [the mudslide area], that makes it very difficult,"" Ridwan Sobri, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross told the BBC. Mr Sobri said the identities and ages of the students could not yet be confirmed. According to AFP, 86 students had initially been reported missing from a Bible camp in the Jonooge Church Training Centre in Sigi Biromaru. It is unclear if the students whose bodies have been found belong to the same group.

With hospitals damaged, injured people have been treated in the open and at least one military field hospital has been set up. The military has taken over the airport to fly aid in, and injured people and other evacuees out.

""We don't have any other choice, we must get food,"" one man told AFP. Mass graves are being dug, one of them to hold up to 300 bodies. The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami. The earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis. Vice-President Jusuf Kalla has said the final death toll could be in the thousands while the Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected.",The 34 students are among the hundreds killed by the quake and tsunami which hit Indonesia.,2018-10-02T02:47:11Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Indonesian quake: Bodies found in church buried by landslide,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45715059,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17990/production/_103665669_gettyimages-1042815920.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tsunami,1
"Robin George Andrews on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In 2011, a colossal tsunami set off by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake slammed into the eastern shores of Japan. Not long afterwards, some of the 1.5 million tons of floating debris created by the waves, from buoys and boats to entire fishing docks, began washing up along Americas northwest Pacific coast. As revealed by a recent study, dozens of species of algaeglobally abundant, as well as those found in Asia and across the northern Pacificsnuck along on this debris and turned up in Oregon and Washington. Spending several years collecting, classifying and observing these tiny beasties, researchers found that most of them were opportunists that had arrived in an environment not dissimilar from their starting points. Had they been given the chance, a full-scale invasion of this brave new world might have taken place. Algae might not sound like much of a danger, but dont forget that these little critters can disrupt entire regions when they get out of hand. Just look offshore from Floridas gulf coast, where a red tide bloom has slaughtered wildlife and devastated the tourist industry. Its even become a hot button issue for voters there in this weeks midterm elections. Thats why this (fortunately averted) incursion matters. Writing in the journal Phycologia, the researchers suggested that if it werent for an extensive and prompt clean-up operation, many of the invaders were likely to have quickly colonized their landing sites. Although its been previously acknowledged that species can ride buoyant debris thousands of miles across the ocean, a 2017 study on the Japanese tsunami was one of the first to document it happening in real time over such a huge scale. It revealed that nearly 300 larger species, from crabs and sea stars to sponges and fish, turned up alive in North America and Hawaii. This new study proves to be an equally eye-opening companion piece. Lead author Gayle Hansen, a marine phycologist at Oregon State University (OSU), explained that the first piece of biota-carrying debris found was the Agate Beach dock, which turned up in June 2012, just over a year after the tsunami occurred. Immediately starting to gather specimens, they ultimately captured 42 pieces of debris between 2012 and 2016 as they washed up in the Pacific Northwest. The debris were found to contain a staggering 84 different species and varieties of algae and cyanobacteria. We did not expect debris to arrive with hitch-hiking biota as we did not think the Japanese species would survive the cross-Pacific journey, she told Earther. Of these, 83 percent were reproductive and dropping spores on examination, while all were capable of becoming fertile. Although many were short-lived, they often had a high colonization potential. Some species had been seen in the Pacific Northwest before, but others were alien, and several were known to be incredibly effective at invading new territory. All things considered, Gaylealong with colleagues at Kobe Universityconcluded that 49 percent of the species that arrived represented an invasion threat to the region. This invasion may have been cancelled, but Hansen referred to numerous earlier examples that hint at what may have transpired. A classic example can be found in Hawaiis Caulerpa taxifolia algae: after having been accidentally introduced to the Mediterranean by an aquarium, it colonized large swaths of the shallow subtidal area, outcompeting the local seagrass. The fish, not willing to eat the toxin-producing invader, experienced a precipitous decline in their populations. John Chapman, a fisheries expert at OSU not involved in the new workand an author of last years tsunami rafting studytold Earther that the environmental threats from introduced algae are very likely underappreciated. Chapman noted that the vast majority of algae are small, which makes them difficult to identify or even detect. This study also found that the smaller species proved to be the longer-term survivors, and were more likely to succeed in invading. This is all problematic, as these critters are likely to be influencing ecosystems in ways that arent yet recognized. And tsunamis are just one part of the problem. Chapman noted that hurricanes, floods, mudslides and pure human messiness all generate floating debris, which is building wider bridges between continents that an enormous diversity of organisms are riding. This article has been updated to clarify that 83 percent of algae varieties the researchers examined were actively reproductive, while all were capable of becoming fertile.","In 2011, a colossal tsunami set off by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake slammed into the eastern shores of Japan.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"After an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia on Friday left more than 800 people dead, a spokesperson for the nations board of national disaster affairs revealed that a critical part of its warning and detection system hasnt been working for years. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), said a network of 22 early-detection buoys havent been operational since 2012, Australias ABC News reported. The buoys, which communicate with seafloor sensors, are supposed to send tsunami warnings to the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics, but are now ineffective due to vandalism and a lack of funding, according to the report. The tide gauges are operating, but they are limited in providing any advance warning, Louise Comfort, a disaster management expert, told the Associated Press. None of the 22 buoys are functioning. In the Sulawesi incident, BMKG (the meteorology and geophysics agency) canceled the tsunami warning too soon, because it did not have data from Palu. This is the data the tsunami detection system could provide. BMKG reportedly sent out a tsunami warning on Friday evening after the earthquake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. Efforts to create better advance tsunami warning systems started after 230,00 people died in a 2004 tsunami, with a majority of those deaths occurring in Indonesia. The buoys were among those effortsGermany and the U.S. reportedly provided 12 of them. However, an earthquake that hit an Indonesian island in 2016 revealed that none of the buoys were working. The buoys have been stalled in a prototype phase for years, reportedly failing to receive the funding needed because of budget cuts and a failure for agencies to agree on project decisions. The buoys reportedly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each on top of the funding needed to maintain their operations. Now we have no buoys in Indonesia, Iyan Turyana, an ocean engineer at BPPT, Indonesias Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, told Phys.org in an article published in January 2017. They are all damaged. Where do you live in Indonesia? Jakarta! Its ok. But if you live in Padang, if you live in Bengkulu, your life is very dangerous.

BEN ROTHENBERG and CHRISTOPHER CLAREY,"“Whilst these deals have generated considerable funds for the sport, they have also greatly expanded the available markets for betting on the lowest levels of professional tennis,” the panel said. “The I.T.F. did not appropriately assess the potential adverse effects of these agreements before entering into them.” The dissolution of that deal was the first and most direct of the 12 recommendations contained in the report. “Discontinuing the sale of official data at these lowest levels of tennis is a necessary, pragmatic and effective approach to containing betting-related breaches of integrity,” the report concluded. The panel also recommended empowering the Tennis Integrity Unit, established in 2008 to investigate betting-related corruption, to further restrict data sales at tournaments at higher levels where systems were “insufficient to protect players from would-be corrupters.” Live data from these tournaments can be used by gambling sites, particularly for betting in which wagers can be made on elements of the match as it progresses. David Haggerty, president of the I.T.F., has said that the Sportradar deal is a symbiotic arrangement that helps increase oversight of betting patterns in the sport. He has argued that it is as much in the betting companies’ interest to eliminate corruption as it is in tennis’s interest. But the review panel disagreed, citing the increased volume of betting on the lower levels of the sport, which has proved to be the most vulnerable to match fixing. It also suggested that the sport at large should help compensate the I.T.F. for the lost revenue if it does follow the panel’s recommendation and end the Sportradar deal. The panel insisted that the lucrative nature of the data sales should not be used as justification to continue the practice, saying, “the resolution of significant integrity concerns cannot be driven by the question of financial return — even when much of it is redistributed to the sport.” The panel also recommended eliminating sponsorships from betting companies. The report said the Tennis Integrity Unit should be reorganized to give it independent oversight, apart from the sport’s governing bodies: the ATP, the WTA, the I.T.F. and the four Grand Slam tournaments. A statement released on behalf of those governing bodies said, “We confirm our agreement in principle with the package of measures and recommendations.” The panel called for the Tennis Integrity Unit to have greater transparency in its proceedings and better cooperation with law enforcement. It also criticized the T.I.U. for lacking personnel with expertise in betting or tennis; many employees of the integrity unit are former police officers. The panel also recommended wider training for players, better security around players at tournaments, and methods to prevent online abuse. There were also recommendations to reform the pathway players take through the lower tiers of tennis to shore up “incentive problems” that exist when players earning little prize money are vulnerable to selling matches. Several reforms for the lowest levels of the sport are already set to be implemented in the 2019 season. In the two years since the panel was created, the T.I.U. has already increased its staff and its budget, and has begun regularly releasing information about its activities in an effort to be more transparent.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","A tsunami that slammed into the beaches of Indonesias Sunda Strait over the weekend has reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least 429 people.
While the cause is still unclear, scientists believe the event may have been caused by underwater landslides resulting from volcanic activity on the island of Anak Krakatoa. Saturdays tsunami struck the neighboring islands of Java and Sumatra without warning, sending people running for their lives. Horrifying video captured the wave slamming into a beachside concert, collapsing the stage as it plowed through to the audience.
Speaking with the Guardian, Dougal Jerram of the department of geosciences at the University of Oslo said tsunamis resulting from volcanic activity may not trigger warning systems that are designed to alarm after large quakes, and thus may provide little warning, unless observed directly or detected by other devices such as wave buoy warning systems.
Hundreds of homes and dozens of hotels were damaged in the disaster, and thousands of people have been displaced. More than 1,400 people were injured, CNN reported Tuesday, and dozens are still missing. The U.S. State Department said it is continuing to monitor the situation and that it is not aware of any U.S. citizens directly affected, but stand ready to assist as needed.
The U.S. Geological Survey, an agency that would normally provide data on the disaster, saw a massive staff reduction resulting from the government shutdown that could last through the new year and has stalled some operations. The Huffington Post reported the agency is operating with only 75 of its roughly 8,032 employees.
Authorities previously cautioned people in the area to avoid beaches around the Sunda Strait, per Reuters, noting a high-tide warning in place through Christmas Day. Residents were again warned on Monday to stay away from beaches over the possibility that another tsunami could strike.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of Indonesias National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said that it is warning people to remain cautious, according to CNN. Nugroho added: Agencies are still continuing to analyze the root cause ... the Krakatau volcano continues to erupt, which could potentially trigger another tsunami.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","A deadly tsunami that struck Indonesia unexpectedly has reportedly left hundreds of people dead and many more missing and injured.
It smashed into the beaches of Indonesias Sunda Strait on Saturday evening with no warning, as no earthquake preceded the event. CNN reported that the tsunami may have resulted from underwater landslides triggered by volcanic activity on the island of Anak Krakatoa.
Unlike tsunamis caused by earthquakes, such volcanically induced tsunamis may not trigger warning systems that are designed to alarm after large quakes, and thus may provide little warning, unless observed directly or detected by other devices such as wave buoy warning systems, Dougal Jerram of the department of geosciences at the University of Oslo told the Guardian. Particularly when the volcano in question, as with Anak Krakatau, is already active and displaying activity such that its eruption is not a new or a surprise event.
The tsunami left hundreds of buildings damaged in its wake, including hotels, homes, and other structures. At least 222 people are dead, though that figure is expected to rise. The Guardian reported that more than 800 people were injured in the incident, and dozens of people are currently missing.
Terrifying footage captured the tsunami crashing into a beachfront concert as the Indonesian pop band Seventeen performed onstage. The bands bass player and manager were reportedly killed after the stage collapsed, and other members of the band remain missing, according to CNN.
Indonesias president Joko Widodo expressed his deep condolences, tweeting that hes ordered all relevant government officials to immediately take emergency response steps, look for and find victims, and care for the injured.
Ilan Kelman, of the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction and Institute for Global Health London at the University College London, told the Guardian that the incident shows the ever-present challenges we face in developing warning systems for hazards like tsunamis.

Aimée Lutkin,"California began using an earthquake warning system this summer that notifies citizens of seismic shifts coming to their area. In theory, that should give you a little time to prepare for the earth moving. Heres what to do with those extra seconds. And it may be only a matter of seconds, according to the L.A. Times. The speed with which people receive that phone buzz relates to how close they are to the quakes epicenter. However, that could make all the difference, since you have a little time to get out of the way of potential falling objects, for instance. This is what you should do: While Driving Pull over! That might be easy, but its also advised that you avoid bridges, overpasses, signs, and power lines. Thats a taller order out on the highway, and maybe something to think about on your daily commute. Where would you pull over? Once youve stopped, set your parking brake and wait until the shaking stops. While Walking Around This is also an issue of finding a spot to stand away from things like power lines, walls, buildings, or other things that could drop on top of you. Remember, falling debris could also come from the side. The more open space there is around you, the better. Drop to the ground, cover your head, and hold on. While In Bed Unless youre under a skylight or something else likely to break on top of you, stay in your bed. Turn on your stomach and cover your head and neck with a pillow for protection from falling ceiling pieces. While At The Beach The danger on a beach is a possible tsunami. Dont take a chance just because theres been no warningget out of there. After the quake ends, walk inland or to high ground immediately. California offers tsunami maps to show which beaches are vulnerable to the big waves. If you cant get away, go into a concrete or steel-frame building. A tsunami can easily wipe out a wood-frame house. While At The Theater If youre at The Greek, for instance, you will want to get down in front of your seat and cover your head and neck. Be careful while exiting after the quake, as debris could still fall from above. While Out With Kids If youre holding an infant, press them against your chest, drop to the ground and cover them with your body like a cage. With mobile kids, the best position to take is on the ground on all fours, because that protects most of your vital organs. instruct them to drop down and take cover, if its available. If not, and youre inside, a corner of the room away from exterior walls and windows is the best place to hunker down. Do Not Run, Do Not Stand In A Doorway A lot of people get hurt while running during an earthquake. The warning system will hopefully give people a moment to do their running, but once the shaking starts, you should stop. Even if you make it to an exit, theres often a lot of debris around doorways. Old adobe houses that are unreinforced are safest in the doorway, but thats about it for most structures. In fact, standing in a doorway can be more dangerous, because that door will slam right on you during the quake. Its time to put that common misconception about earthquake safety to bed.","California began using an earthquake warning system this summer that notifies citizens of seismic shifts coming to their area.

 Some residents have been returning to the area to look at cherry blossom
A Japanese town whose population fled the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster has partially reopened eight years later.
Radiation levels in parts of Okuma, west of the Daiichi plant, have been deemed safe for residents to return.
About 50 people have begun moving back to areas in the town where decontamination efforts were focused.
The plant was hit by a tsunami, causing the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.
Critics have accused the Japanese government of expediting residents' return in an attempt to showcase safety standards ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Okuma's 10,000 residents were among nearly half a million people to flee the region after the disaster.
BBC Tokyo Correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes says the vast majority of the town's original inhabitants are unlikely to go back. 
Only 367 people - around 3.5% of the town's original population - had registered as residents as of late March, local reports said.
Japanese authorities are hoping new infrastructure, including a town hall and state-owned housing, will attract residents to return.

However radiation remains a major concern for residents, especially those with children.
A survey by Japanese newspaper the Asahi Shimbun found just over half of residents in Fukushima Prefecture felt that progress has been made toward recovery. 
The 2011 Fukushima disaster saw three reactors of the nuclear power plant, some 62km (39 miles) south-east of the city of Fukushima, fail after it was damaged and flooded in the tsunami.
The accident forced more than 470,000 people to be evacuated because of nuclear contamination concerns.
Just under 18,500 people were killed or went missing after an earthquake triggered the massive tsunami that led to the meltdown.

 More than 18,000 people died or went missing in the tsunami
Though no-one died as a direct result of the nuclear meltdown, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) has paid out compensation to some of those affected. 
More than 40 patients had to be evacuated from a hospital in the area and later died, while other deaths have been linked to the trauma suffered by those who lost their homes and loved ones.
In 2017, three former Tepco executives went on trial charged with professional negligence linked to the hospital evacuation.","Okuma, a town near the wrecked Fukushima power plant, has partially reopened.",2019-04-10T10:55:20Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Fukushima nuclear disaster: Abandoned town allows first residents home,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47879768,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/131E4/production/_106380387_mediaitem106380386.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tsunami,1
Jennings Brown,"No one should ever screw around on a public alert system. But considering it’s been a bad year for warning systems—from the Hawaii false emergency alert accidentally informing the public of an incoming missile that didn’t exist to the National Weather Service’s false tsunami warning to the Department of Justice’s Amber Alert site issues that redirected visitors to porn sites —now is an especially bad time for someone to be screwing around on an alert system. But that may have been what happened when the City of Lake Worth, Florida, sent out a “zombie alert” during a power outage around 1:45am Sunday. “There are now far less than seven-thousand-three-hundred-eighty customers involved due to extreme zombie activity,” the alert states. (Get it? There are fewer customers because many are zombies now!) The message said the alert was for “residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.” Since Terminus is a location in The Walking Dead, it seems likely this message was sent out as a joke or was the result of a hack. The city public information officer, Ben Kerr, told Gizmodo this has been a reoccurring issue. “We first became aware of the zombie messages during Hurricane Irma,” Kerr told Gizmodo. He doesn’t know when the culprit got into the system and changed the messages, but the city noticed during the August 2017 hurricane because many (zombie-tainted) outage alerts were going out. At the time, the city was able to attend to the message issues before the public noticed. Lake Worth’s electric utility system is set up to send out automatic alerts when there’s an outage. The system has thousands of pre-programmed messages, Kerr explained. But it seems that at some point someone went through and messed with some of the messages to turn them into zombie jokes. “The actual power systems were not in any way compromised. This is a separate messaging system that at some point has been compromised,” Kerr said. “They just added a zombie fantasy.” Kerr says the city has is investigating the prank, and has finally scrubbed all the zombie messages from the system. “Hopefully the next time there is a zombie invasion alert,” Kerr said, “it will be a real zombie invasion.” [ Palm Beach Post / Lake Worth Live ]",No one should ever screw around on a public alert system.

TIMOTHY EGAN,"A winning strategy is to go directly to the self-interest of a majority that is being hurt by Republican policies. The two biggest political thrusts of the Party of Trump a tax cut for the rich that opened a tsunami of debt, and trying to take away health care from millions are widely unpopular. This election should be no more complicated than that. Thats exactly what Williams, who says she will not support Nancy Pelosi as House party leader, has figured out. While still a teenager, she lost her mother. And she later lost her husband, a Vietnam veteran, to early death as well. That gave her a sense of how life can throw a random punch to the gut. The millionaires have lots of people helping them, she says. Im running for Congress because we need someone who will fight for us. In a state that Trump won by 20 points, shes polling about even with Gianforte. Not to be too dramatic about it, but Kathleen Williams is the congressional candidate Montana has been waiting for, wrote the Missoulian newspaper in a recent editorial endorsement. Gianforte, a tech magnate said to be worth about $600 million, favors tax cuts for people like himself and is against expanding health care for those at the other end. A Montana ballot measure that would raise tobacco taxes to provide health care for the working poor is well ahead in the polls. The key here is independent voters around 44 percent of the electorate who are willing to cut through the daily cable news fat in search of the real meat of politics. Its frustrating, during a week in which Trump has probably set a record for most lies to come out of a White House in so short a time, to stay focused on boring policy. Trump is counting on people being stupid, and easily distracted. Montana, a state that in 1916 sent the first woman to Congress, can show him otherwise, with the election of another woman in 2018.

 Anak Krakatau as it looked on New Year's Day. Planet's constellation maximises the chances of getting a cloud-free view
There is now some very good optical satellite imagery of the collapsed Anak Krakatau volcano, which generated a devastating tsunami on 22 December.
Poor weather conditions over Indonesia's Sunda Strait had frustrated spacecraft that view the Earth in the same type of light as our eyes.
But the team at Planet has managed to find windows in the cloud.
Pictures from its Dove and SkySat platforms show the extent of the volcanic cone's failure.
It is easier to appreciate now how the island has been reshaped.
What was once a crater at the summit of a 340m-high edifice has been completely broken open to form a small bay.
Indonesia's disaster agency says more than two-thirds of Anak Krakatau's volume (150-170 million cubic metres) is missing. Much of it is assumed to have slipped into the sea in the colossal landslide that produced the tsunami.

 After the event: One of Planet's Doves observes the scene a week after the disaster (30/12/2018)
Earth observation company Planet, which is based in San Francisco, operates one of the world's largest satellite constellations.
The big network maximises the chances of seeing the ground when cloud clears above a target. 
Planet's small Dove spacecraft capture details on the ground larger than 3m - what is termed medium resolution. While its SkySat platforms have a high-resolution capability, capturing details larger than 72cm. 
SkySat was responsible for the picture at the top of this page, taken on New Year's Day.
The satellite pictures acquired immediately after the disaster came from radar spacecraft, and gave the first hints that Anak Krakatau had collapsed. 
Radar instruments can pierce cloud but they return a very different type of view to optical satellites, and need a particular skill to interpret. 
It's now thought some 430 people died along the coastlines of Java and Sumatra when the tsunami hit.
Thousands more remain displaced.

JEFFREY GETTLEMAN,"Many of us no doubt marvel that in the 21st century such a place exists. As Adam Goodheart wrote in a beautiful piece years ago in The American Scholar, North Sentinel had somehow managed to slip through the net of history. But Mr. Chaus widely reported death has dragged this island out of obscurity and raised some fundamental moral questions. How should we, in the modern world, interact with the last of these very fragile groups? Is it better to stick the island in a glass museum case, which the Indian government has essentially done, and try to keep anyone from interacting with the islanders? Or is that paternalistic, denying the people there the same things that just about the whole world has agreed it wants, like education, health care and technology? The same issues routinely come up in the Amazon, where a few fragile groups still exist, though theyre not quite as isolated. Every day, loggers, anthropologists, traders and tourists get a step closer to them. What Mr. Chau, 26, did clearly did not work. He came with gifts in hand (scissors, safety pins, a soccer ball) and the islanders killed him. The police cant even get his body back. It is still lying on the beach. What he did was also illegal. The Indian government prohibits contact, deeming the islanders an ultrasensitive human treasure. Perhaps that is paternalistic; perhaps it is morally sound. Mr. Chau saw it as his moral imperative to get to the island. In his evangelical worldview, it is an act of compassion to introduce people to Christianity; that is the only way to save them from burning in hell. Its called the Great Commission, and North Sentinel represented the greatest commission, since no one we know of had ever tried to convert the islanders. Since his death, many people, including fellow missionaries, have called him naïve, delusional and reckless. I have zero sympathy for Chau, said David Schmidt, a former evangelical missionary. His actions, Mr. Schmidt said, were not only foolhardy, they were criminal. And speaking of crimes, was it criminal for the islanders to kill Mr. Chau? The Indian police have opened a homicide case. Another moral question is whether any islanders should be punished for Mr. Chaus death. Anvita Abbi, a linguistics professor with deep knowledge of North Sentinel, said the islanders have a right to defend their territory. She said its no different from the Stand Your Ground laws in the United States that allow people to shoot intruders.","A tribesman aims an arrow at an Indian Coast Guard helicopter flying over North Sentinel Island in December 2004, two days after an Indian Ocean tsunami.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit the eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday is confirmed to have killed hundreds of people, the New York Times reported on Saturday, with at least 405 confirmed deaths in the city of Palu and the toll likely to rise much higher as search-and-rescue teams continue to arrive. Hundreds more are injured. The Times reported that the disaster leveled large swathes of the city in addition to nearby coastal communities, with thousands of structures destroyed. The precise number of dead may be difficult to determine, the paper added, as there were workers and security personnel present as preparations were underway for a beachside festival with dances and other performances, as well a high likelihood the tsunami pulled many people back into the ocean: The twin disasters a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, and the swirling wall of water it unleashed killed at least 405 people in Palu and destroyed thousands of buildings there, including a shopping mall, a hotel, seaside restaurants and several mosques. We have found corpses from the earthquake as well as bodies swept up by the tsunami, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, said in a television interview. Indonesian officials were preparing for a sharp rise in the death toll because search-and-rescue teams had yet to reach populous coastal settlements near Palu. Vice President Jusuf Kalla of Indonesia told a local news website that thousands may have died, with an unknown number washed out to sea. Kalla added that when the infamous Indian Ocean tsunami struck Aceh in northern Sumatra in 2004, a death toll initially indicated at 40 people eventually rose to over over 130,000 (estimates suggest at least 230,000 people died as a result of the disaster in total across 14 countries). Palu, a city of 300,000, may have also been particularly hard struck because emergency alert systems that could have warned of the tsunami were rendered useless by collapsing cell towers during the earthquake, the Times wrote. Indonesias meteorological and physics agency also lifted its own tsunami advisory little more than half an hour after the earthquake struck, though it has not yet been determined whether the waves were already hitting the coast by the time it chose to do so. The Washington Post reported that the nations emergency officials are investigating why many members of the public did not seem to have been properly alerted about the risk of the wave: Indonesian officials also may face another reckoning over why the tsunami alerts were pulled even as a disaster was roaring ashore, raising questions about the level of monitoring and post-quake analysis in a nation along some of the worlds most active fault lines. People were still going about their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesias National Disaster Management Agency, who said that hundreds were gathered in Palu for a beach party. The number of deaths, he said, will continue to rise as the search continues. The emergency response is being hindered by damaged or destroyed roads, ports, and communications lines, the Post added, as well as the number of personnel still deployed to the island of Lombok following another devastating 6.9-magnitude earthquake that killed over 450 in August. A 21-year-old air traffic controller at a regional airport, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, stayed at his post as other personnel evacuated, ensuring the takeoff of Batik Air Flight 6231. According to the Post, the plane had hundreds on board; the air traffic controller jumped from the tower to his death as its roof collapsed, while the pilot (identified by the Times as Ricosetta Mafella) posted a short video of the oncoming wave to Instagram. Thank God there is a voice (Holy Spirit i believe) telling me to depart early, he wrote. Im rushing the boarding process. Late by 30 second i would not have flown. Though Indonesia is in the Ring of Firea roughly 25,000-mile chain of volcanoes and other tectonic hot spots that stretches across the Pacific Ocean and plays host to 90 percent of the worlds earthquakes National Geographic reported that the tsunami was unexpected at this quake. It was recorded as the result of a strike-slip fault, during which tectonic plates grind against each other horizontally rather than vertically. Vertical displacement is more likely to cause a tsunami than horizontal movement of a fault. According to National Geographic, University of Oxford geophysicist Baptiste Gombert said that the regions geology is incredibly complex but initial signs are that landslides either above or below the water line played a role. Its also possible the waves were amplified by the shape of the bay as the tsunami forced water into the restricted space. Indonesias central statistics agency estimates that around 2.4 million people could be impacted by the disaster, according to the Times.

Eyewitnesses described fleeing for their lives as beachfront homes were swept away in the churning sea. 
A crowd was watching Indonesian pop band Seventeen at a show organized by state-run electric company PLN at the Tanjung Lesun beach resort when the massive wave crashed through the stage and threw it into the audience. 
The band's bass player and manager were killed, lead singer Riefian Fajarsyah said in a tearful video posted on Instagram. Three other members of Seventeen and Fajarsyah's wife whose birthday is Sunday are still missing, he said.

At least 558 houses were destroyed, while nine hotels, 60 restaurants and 350 boats were heavily damaged, an indication of the tsunami's impact on residential and tourist areas. 
As of midday Sunday, no foreigners had been reported killed or injured. 
Tsunami caused by underwater landslides
The tsunami is believed to have been triggered when the Krakatoa volcano erupted in the Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra, prompting a series of underwater landslides, according to Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geological Agency (BMKG). 
When the displaced rock shifted beneath the water's surface, it ""pushed up"" the water on top of it, CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar said, and generated the tsunami. 
Krakatoa sits between the islands of Java and Sumatra. 
The tsunami's impacts were compounded by a tidal wave caused by the full moon, BMKG said in a news release. 
Krakatoa is known for its 1883 eruption -- one of the deadliest in recorded history -- that killed more than 36,000 people. 
Despite the devastating 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands of people, Indonesia lacks proper equipment to warn of an incoming tsunami threat. 
""We need a multi-hazard early warning system,"" said Nugroho. ""And we need lots of it."" 
Nugroho pointed out tsunamis are faster and less predictable than tidal waves, which are caused by atmospheric conditions. 
""We used to know that a tsunami happens after an earthquake. There was no quake last night,"" he said, referring to the sub-aquatic landslides. ""That is why there was no warning."" 
Prayers pour in from around the world
Pope Francis prayed for the tsunami victims at his regular Sunday Angelus service in St. Peter's Square.
""I am spiritually close to the displaced and to all the people affected, imploring God for relief in their suffering,"" he said. ""My appeal is that these brothers and sisters may not lack our solidarity and the support of the international community."" 
US President Donald Trump addressed the ""unthinkable devastation"" on Twitter Sunday morning. ""We are praying for recovery and healing,"" Trump wrote. ""America is with you!"" 
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Indonesia expects the death toll to rise, spokeswoman Kathy Mueller said. It's providing support by bringing in basic household items, clean water and equipment to clear debris. 
The UN World Food Programme also stood ready to support the Indonesian government, according to WFP spokeswoman Bettina Luescher.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The quake was large - but not of the type normally associated with a big tsunami event Friday's catastrophic tsunami event on Sulawesi Island is a puzzle. As the emergency response gathers pace, scientists are scratching their heads to understand why it generated such big waves. The magnitude 7.5 quake was certainly large - one of the biggest recorded anywhere on the globe this year. But it was what geophysicists call a strike-slip event, where the ground breaks horizontally. In this instance, the rock to the east of the fault running up through the island moved northwards relative to the rock to the west. Strike-slip quakes can cause tsunami events but the 6m-tall waves that crashed ashore at Palu city surprised everyone. Remember that to make the series of waves you need a big displacement of the sea-floor - a vertical movement that disturbs the entire water column, which then moves away in all directions. Some early calculations suggest a floor displacement of perhaps half a metre. Significant but generally insufficient to produce the waves that were recorded. So what happened? Two factors are emerging as possible culprits. They may even have worked hand in hand. The first is the suspicion that the quake triggered some sort of underwater landslide. These are an ever-present danger. A quake can destabilise large collections of sediment and cause them to break free of their footing and tumble downslope. In mountainous areas on land, rock and sediment avalanches are major earthquake hazards that rival the destruction from collapsed buildings. But underwater, these movements of sediment have the potential to also generate tsunami events. When this happens, the waves that hit shorelines can be large, even if the effects are fairly localised. This may have been what happened on Friday, and perhaps the waves were then exacerbated by the shape of Palu bay itself. It has an elongated geometry, which could have focused and amplified the tsunamis as they approached the city's Talise beach. Image copyright AFP This is all conjecture, of course. The science community, as we speak, will be modelling Friday's event to try to tie down the details of the generation and propagation processes involved. ""My first calculations of the seafloor deformation in the earthquake are 49cm,"" said Dr Mohammad Heidarzadeh, an assistant professor of civil engineering specialising in coastal engineering at Brunel University in the UK. ""From that you might expect a tsunami of less than one metre, not six metres. So something else is happening. So the two speculations are legitimate - the submarine landslide and the funnelling caused by the bay."" A straightforward way to assess any changes on the seafloor is to carry out a bathymetric survey. This would ascertain pretty quickly whether there has been significant movements of sediment. As to onshore landslides, these will be mapped from satellite. Image copyright PLANET Image caption Satellite imagery shows districts swept away in lateral movements of sediment You may have seen some remarkable videos at the weekend of whole swathes of ground moving laterally in front of the camera. Image copyright YouTube Image caption In one video, an antenna is seen to slide in front of someone's mobile phone In one, a tall antenna eerily marches across the landscape ; in others, buildings drift sideways as if suddenly caught afloat on a river. The locations of many of these videos have now been identified, and from the earliest space imagery it is possible to discern places where whole districts of Palu have been picked up and dumped into vast piles. ""If you look at the satellite imagery, you can see that there are masses of houses compressed into a small zone, leaving behind a bare area of ground behind where the houses once were,"" explained Prof Dave Petley, a landslides expert at Sheffield University. ""This looks like classic 'liquefaction', where the structure of soil has collapsed; it's fluidised and you get these very active landslides on a low gradient,"" he told BBC News. Everything should become clearer in the coming days and weeks as researchers get on the ground to assess the nature of the damage. The world's fleet of satellites have also been tasked to get as much imagery of the region as possible. Being equatorial, this can be complicated by there being a lot of cloud in the sky which optical satellites cannot penetrate. But there will be overpasses by radar spacecraft as well, and these see the ground in all weather, day and night.

Fukushima residents have reacted angrily to the statue of a boy in protective gear, saying it gives the impression of a city still contaminated after the 2011 nuclear disaster. Fukushima's nuclear plant was hit by a tsunami in 2011, causing the most serious such accident since Chernobyl. The statue was erected in early August and its creator said it was about hope for a world free from nuclear disaster. Artist Kenji Yanobe has since apologised for making residents uneasy. According to Japanese news agency Kyodo, angry citizens took to Twitter and called the authorities directly, demanding for the statue to be removed as it would harm the reputation of Fukushima. The statue is named ""Sun Child"" and can be found outside Fukushima's train station. It depicts a boy wearing a yellow hazmat suit, holding his helmet in one hand and a sun symbol in the other. A monitor counter on his chest displays the numbers ""000"" to show there is no radiation. ""I wanted to make a work that encourages people… and made the statue of a child standing up bravely and strongly against any difficulties it faces,"" Mr Yanobe said, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo.

The accident forced more than 200,000 people to leave their homes because of nuclear contamination concerns. More than 18,500 people were killed or went missing after an earthquake triggered the massive tsunami that led to the meltdown. Parts of the damaged reactors are still highly contaminated but most of the prefecture has been declared safe again. The artist Mr Yanobe said he ""should have paid more attention to the fact that accurate knowledge about radiation is needed much more now than before the disaster"". Image copyright AFP He also said he wanted to discuss the future of his statue with the city. The city's mayor defended the decision to put up the statue, arguing it had been well received at exhibitions in Japan and around the world before it was installed permanently in Fukushima.

In the days that followed, poor weather and incessant cloud cover over the region prevented satellites from capturing a clear view of the island volcano. Grainy radar images released on December 27 were the first to provide visual evidence of the collapse, but new images released today by Planet Labs, a private Earth-imaging company based in San Francisco, show Anak Krakatau both before and after the landslide, in exquisite detail. Planet Labs captured the images using its Dove and SkySat platforms, as BBC reports. 
An image taken on December 17, 2018 shows the volcano just five days before the collapse. Other than a plume of smoke rising from the top of its cone, nothing seems out of the ordinary.
A shocking image taken on December 30a week after the disastershows the shattered remains of the island volcano. Every edge and contour of the island is now different, its shape irrevocably changed. A gaping lagoonnow a bayappears where the mountain once stood. Foliage that once grew along the islands eastern regions appears to be completely gone. A copious amount of light brown sediment can be seen wafting in the waters along the islands western and southern coasts.
A satellite photo captured just yesterday, on January 2, offers a closer view of the island. Thick white smoke can be seen billowing from the volcanos new cone, while no shred of vegetation can be seen on the islands surface. The new bay appears to have shrunk since December 30, suggesting ongoing seismic activity and land slips as the volcano continues to rumble and settle.
Writing at the Landslide Blog, geologist David Petley said the new images show that a significant portion of the landslide came from above sea level (a subaerial landslide), contrary to initial reports that it was a submarine landslide. 
No remains of the landslide are seenit left almost nothing behind as far as I can seeso the entire volume of 150-170 million cubic metres entered the water, wrote Petley. It is unsurprising therefore that it generated a very significant tsunami in the local area.
Whats more, Petley said the toe, or base, of the landslide was extremely broad, which meant the landslide would have been able to displace water across a very large front.
Looking at these photos, Anak Krakatau appears to be one of the most formidable and uninviting places on Earth at the moment. And as the smoke billowing from its surface suggests, it continues to be an active volcano. Residents along the Sumatra and Java coast are being told to stay on high alert for fear of further tsunamis.

The death toll following the tsunami caused by the Anak Krakatau volcano has risen to at least 373, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency says.
Saturday saw giant waves crash into coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java. 
It is thought that volcanic activity set off undersea landslides which in turn generated the killer waves.
""1,459 people are injured, while 128 remain missing,"" said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a statement.
Coastal residents near the volcano have been warned to keep away from beaches amid fears it could trigger a new tsunami.
Anak Krakatau erupted again on Sunday, spewing ash and smoke.
Video shot from a charter plane captured the magnitude of the volcanic event in the Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java.
Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads but heavy lifting equipment is being transported to badly hit areas to help search for victims. 
What warning was given?
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency told a news conference that another tsunami is a possibility because of the continued volcanic eruptions of Anak Krakatau. 
""Recommendations from [the] Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while,"" he said.

 A satellite image of Anak Krakatau erupting in August
Anak Krakatau, which emerged in 1927 from the caldera that was formed during the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, has seen increased activity in recent months with people asked to avoid the area around its crater.
On Monday Mr Sutopo put out a series of tweets explaining why there was no early warning for this tsunami. He said that Indonesia's early warning system is set up to monitor earthquakes but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves. 
But, he added, with 13% of the world's volcanoes in Indonesia alone, it was crucial for the country to develop such system.
He confirmed there was no tsunami advance warning system on the night of the disaster, adding that because of lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults there had been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012. 
Why was Saturday's tsunami so deadly?
The tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake.
Seawater did not recede as it would with an earthquake tsunami and experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time.

The waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations, including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java.
Footage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing. 
Members of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage.
How did the tsunami happen?
By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent
Everyone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous. 
In other words, it's been part of the background. 
And yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water.
The first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in the west-southwest flank of the volcano. This would have sent millions of tonnes of rocky debris into the sea, pushing out waves in all directions. 
How common are tsunamis in Indonesia?
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit
Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim.
In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.
On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.
However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.
Krakatoa (Krakatau in Indonesian)
Image copyrightOystein Lund Andersen
In August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history:
Massive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people
Thousands more were killed by hot ash
The eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945
The eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away
World temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year
The volcanic island virtually disappeared

George Dvorsky,"Volunteer rescuers working on beaches along Sundra Strait have rescued more than 30 stranded sea turtles, following the Indonesian tsunami that has killed hundreds of people, the Guardian reports.
On December 22, Indonesias Anak Krakatau island volcano triggered a massive landslide, generating a tsunami that killed at least 430 people. With nearly 160 people still missing, support and rescue teams have been scouring the affected areas in hopes of finding survivors. But as the Guardian reports, these rescuers keep stumbling upon stranded sea turtles, who cant get back into the ocean because theyre either tangled up in debris, upside down, or too far from shore. To date, more than 30 sea turtles have been returned to the ocean, the Guardian reports. 
For the rescuers, the primary goal is to search for human survivors or, regrettably, bodies. Earlier this week, after human needs were addressed, volunteer Eko Sulistio organized a seven-person team in Banten province to attend to the turtles in distress, the Guardian reports. His team managed to save more than 20 turtles, including loggerhead turtles, hawksbill turtles, and green turtlesall of which are either listed as endangered or threatened depending on their geographic location. Another group led by the Serang Nature Conservation Agency managed to save another 13 turtles. 
Some turtles were as far as a kilometer away from the shore, Sulistio told the Guardian, while others were hopelessly tangled in marine garbage or flailing upside down. Many turtles were found near the Tanjung Lesung resort, where over 106 people died as a result of the tsunami. 
The rescuers improvised stretchers by using tarps, rice sacks, and sticks. One turtle, found stuck in a pile of garbage and lying nearly upside down, weighed upwards of 66 pounds (30 kilograms), requiring four people to lift it back to sea, AFP reports. 
But dehydration, starvation, and predation arent the only threats facing the stranded sea turtles. 
Some fishermen tried to get the turtles, maybe to eat them, but I told them not to, Sulistio told the Guardian. They loaded them on a motorbike but I stopped them and warned them that the turtles were protected by law.
Nearly a week after the tsunami, officials in Indonesia are concerned that ongoing activity at Anak Krakatau could trigger more tsunamis. Residents are being told to stay on alert, while all flights around the volcano have been rerouted and a 5-kilometer (3-mile) exclusion zone implemented. 
The rescuing of 30-plus turtles will be of small consolation to those who have lost loved ones, but its a tiny, and significant, glimmer of light in an otherwise horrible situation.

Japan's Olympics Minister Yoshitaka Sakurada has resigned over comments that offended people affected by a huge tsunami and earthquake in 2011. 
At a fund-raising event, he suggested that backing the governing LDP member of parliament for the region was more important than its economic revival. 
It is not the first time Mr Sakurada has been forced to apologise. 
He said in February that he was disappointed by a Japanese swimmer's leukaemia diagnosis.
He said he was worried that medal favourite Rikako Ikee's illness might dampen enthusiasm for next year's Olympics. 
Mr Sakurada also admitted last year to never having used a computer, despite being Japan's cyber security minister. 
After accepting Mr Sakurada's resignation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe apologised for appointing him. 
""I deeply apologise for his remark to the people in the disaster-hit areas,"" said Mr Abe.
The 2011 tsunami left more than 20,000 dead and caused a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. 
Shunichi Suzuki, who had been Olympics minister before Mr Sakurada was appointed last October, will be return to the post. 
In February, Mr Sakurada had to make another apology, after arriving three minutes late to a parliamentary meeting on Thursday. 
Opposition MPs said his poor timekeeping showed disrespect for his office and boycotted a meeting of the budget committee for five hours in protest. 
He also came under fire in 2016 for describing so-called comfort women forced to provide sexual services to Japanese war-time troops as ""professional prostitutes"".","Yoshitaka Sakurada latest error has brought his resignation, 15 months before the Tokyo 2020 games.",2019-04-11T00:19:10Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Japan's Yoshitaka Sakurada resigns as Olympics minister,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47889356,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10900/production/_106404876_afp.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tsunami,1
HENRY FOUNTAIN,"The tsunami that killed hundreds of people on Sumatra and Java in Indonesia late Saturday is a reminder that such destructive waves are not always caused by earthquakes.
This disaster, which struck without warning and killed at least 222 people and injured more than 800 others, appeared to have been caused by volcanic activity.
No earthquakes were recorded before the tsunami struck, the Indonesian authorities said. But there had been an eruption on the volcanic island of Anak Krakatau about half an hour before, they said, one of a series of eruptions there in recent weeks.
Tsunamis are created when large amounts of water in the ocean, a bay or even a lake are quickly displaced. In an earthquake, that displacement can occur when the ground moves as a fault breaks.
This was the mechanism by which a 9.1 magnitude earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, off Aceh Province in northern Indonesia, spawned large waves that traveled across the Indian Ocean and killed 250,000 people.
Many other tsunamis have also followed earthquakes, including those in September that devastated the city of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a 7.5 magnitude quake.
Volcanic activity creates tsunamis differently. One possibility is an explosive eruption, or general weakening of the flanks of a volcano by hot magma passing through it. Either way, part of the volcano perhaps, in the case of Anak Krakatau, a part that is underwater can collapse, creating a landslide that displaces water.
Another possible mechanism is the collapse of a magma chamber below the volcano as it empties during an eruption.
Volcano-related tsunamis are not uncommon. An eruption in 1792 in Japan created waves that were several hundred feet high. Landslides during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington spawned large waves in a lake nearby.
Perhaps the most famous volcanic disaster in history, the 1883 eruption of Krakatau, also called Krakatoa, triggered tsunamis that killed tens of thousands of people. (Anak Krakatau island was built up in place of Krakatau, which was obliterated in the 1883 event.)
Landslides hitting water can sometimes create huge waves. The largest wave ever recorded was caused by a landslide into Lituya Bay, in southeast Alaska, in July 1958. It followed an earthquake, not an eruption, but created a wave that wiped vegetation off the hillside on the opposite side of the bay.
A United States Geological Survey geologist, measuring the scouring marks, determined that the height of the wave had been more than 1,700 feet.","No earthquakes were recorded before the tsunami struck, the Indonesian authorities said.

Friday's meeting shows Facebook's efforts to become a lot more proactive when it comes to preventing bad actors from using its platform to spread propaganda and fake election-related news. The social network became the target of a never-ending tsunami of criticisms after it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica used data collected from Facebook to influence voters to favor the politicians it's working with.

"Robin George Andrews on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Indonesia is reeling from a series of geologically-triggered disasters. While it was still assessing the fallout from Augusts deadly Lombok earthquake, a major earthquake on September 28 triggered a tsunami that slammed into Central Sulawesi. According to the latest UN reports, this disaster robbed at least 2,010 people of their lives, with 700 still reported missing. The tragedy in Sulawesi may be falling out of the news cycle, but the recovery efforts there are now in full swing. For emergency responders, the hard work of getting supplies, shelter, healthcare and education to those in need is just beginning. It hasnt been easy. The population is in shock, to be quite frank, Susan Mangicaro, the Indonesia response management team leader at International Medical Corps, told Earther. The quake, tsunami and associated landslides in late September destroyed or severely damaged 67,000 homes, leaving 330,000 people without proper shelters. Marc Vergara, chief of communications for UNICEF, said that entire neighborhoods in Central Sulawesi have simply vanished, literally erased from the map. Tens of thousands of displaced people are being packed into temporary emergency shelters where limited aid can be administered. State officials with Indonesias national disaster management authority (BNPB) and the military are leading the recovery efforts. Right now, those officials are still working out what type of aid needs prioritizing and who might be best placed to help hand it out. Meanwhile, international NGOs and local partners that have received permission to work alongside the BNPB are working round the clock to fill in the gaps and do what they can. Maya Kroitoru, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee s director of operations for disaster relief and development, told Earther that upon arrival in Sulawesi in the days following the tsunami, the scene was desperate and grim. The population is in shock. She described how people lacking food and water plundered aid trucks, how the bodies of the dead were still scattered along the road, and how her team of aid workers waited in line for seven hours to enter the city of Palu where the full force of the tsunami struck. She described the city as paralyzed. Several weeks later, getting help to the afflicted sites is still proving immensely difficult. The airport at Palu was extensively damaged, and roads leading to the city are covered in mudslides. Journeys that should take 8-10 hours are taking 20-25 instead, according to Mangicaro. The dire situation has been exacerbated by heavy disruption to the regions already sub-standard infrastructure. Water and sewerage systems have been knocked out completely in tsunami-hit Palu and Donggala. In plenty of regions, electricity is down and cell phone communications are been extremely limited. The main priorities for all actors on the ground is to prevent further emergencies from happening, Daniel von Rège, the Doctors Without Borders country director for Indonesia, told Earther. Here were talking about mainly reducing the spread of diseases linked to lack of clean water for drinking, washing and cooking. Electrical generators, water purification kits, health servicesboth mental and physicaland the management of vector-borne diseases are at the top of the list. Vergara said that food is now somewhat less of a problem that it was in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, although various aid agencies have said that there are still reports of communities being cut off from basic supplies. UNICEF is working with the Ministry of Education to get kids back to school as quickly as possibleno easy feat after 2,700 schools were damaged. The plan is to set up temporary tent classrooms while training teachers to cater to the children who need their education to continue. Education is a tool for recovery, Vergara said, adding that restoring a sense of normalcy is important. This is difficult for many reasons, including the fact that many residents are now afraid of being so close to the sea. The ocean isnt all they have to fear. During disasters like these, crime rates also rise, exacerbated by the willful spread of hoaxes and misinformation. According to a study by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, gender-based violence can rise following natural disasters, too. And a high number of children have been separated from their families, placing them at risk of sexual exploitation, violence and trafficking. So far, working alongside the Ministry of Social Affairs, UNICEF has helped to identify 61 such children, and three have been reunited with their parents. Sadly, many are feared to have been orphaned. As is always the case, these disasters didnt affect everyone equally. It is the very vulnerable and poor who are most in danger when these disasters strike, Kroitoru said. People fear being forgotten once the cameras are gone. Plenty of NGOs hire local staff, as they know the affected population, language, customs and culture best. Sadly, some of those local aid workers have been swept up in the disaster too. Mangicaro of International Medical Corps said that one of their in-country aid workers homes was destroyed by the tsunami, but that he and his family were physically unharmed. Immediately after the disaster struck, he began an on-site assessment, even though he had to sleep outside. Its not clear how long recovery will take. Lessons can be drawn from the past disasterslike the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed 230,000 people across 14 countriesbut only to a certain extent. No two disasters are exactly alike. Despite the unknowns, first responders do know that certain things must always be done after a disaster strikes. Building resilience is vital. Training, education and assisting the local population is the best way you can help out, Mangicaro explained. Indeed, although theres a debate as to what extent Indonesias current early warning system may have failed and contributed to the crisis, seismologists have stressed that plays second fiddle to public awareness of natural hazards. Effective safety advice, tailored to the regions specific geology and society, needs to be properly disseminated through community-driven initiatives. Long term, infrastructural reconstruction and restoration will also be vital. In an ideal world, earthquake-proof building codes would be applied and reinforced, and tsunami barriers would be set up in vulnerable areas. This, however, depends entirely on resource availability and the governments willingness to act, both of which are lacking at present in Indonesia. Kroitoru explained that its critical for everyone to understand that the emergency does not end when the headlines recede. People fear being forgotten once the cameras are gone, Vergara said. Practical help is required for communities in Sulawesi, but they also value dignity and emotional support too.","Indonesia is reeling from a series of geologically-triggered disasters.

Shannon Connellan,"A magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the Indonesian island region of Sulawesi on Friday. The natural disasters claimed at least 1,234 lives, according to the death toll reported on Tuesday. Officials fear the toll will continue to rise. Most of these deaths have occurred in the coastal city of Palu, with many victims still to be located within the ruins. Mass burials have begun in the area, and thousands are now homeless across the region, sheltering in some 200 displacement sites. SEE ALSO: An Indonesian tsunami's devastation captured in new, horrifying video We don't know the full breadth of the impact of the disaster just yet. As Reuters reports, more remote areas have been out of contact for over three days, though rescuers are finally reaching those locations. Thousands of homes have collapsed in the Sulawesi region, along with hospitals, hotels, and shopping centers. Image: Carl Court/Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo has requested ""urgent"" international aid, and the global community is identifying different ways to assist Indonesia during the disaster. The hardest hit cities, Palu and the coastal city Donggala, are the most in need. According to Charity Navigator, officials are reporting that supplies like food, water, and medicine are running low, shelter is scarce for thousands of displaced people, and some of the affected areas are proving hard to reach. Clearing a path to reach victims and deliver aid is a priority. BBC reports that aid agencies have been struggling to access affected areas due to damage at Palu's main airport, roads cut off by landslides, and power is out across much of the region. So, how can you personally help? Here's our list of ways you can support survivors, which will be updated to reflect the ultimate scale of the earthquake and tsunami's devastation: 1. Donate to reputable nonprofits and charities. Charity Navigator has published a list of highly-rated organisations that are focused on delivering general aid and relief, medical services and hygiene kits, as well as food, water, toilets, and basic shelter. Here are the organisations listed as working on tsunami recovery for Indonesia: Heart to Heart International, World Vision, Direct Relief, Project HOPE, Water Mission, GlobalGiving, Save the Children, International Medical Corps, Helping Hand for Relief and Development, and World Help. Though not featured on Charity Navigator's list, Indonesian Red Cross Society (or Palang Merah Indonesia), Red Cross Australia, UNICEF, Oxfam, and CARE Australia, are organisations already on the ground or preparing to help victims. Indonesian Red Cross (or PMI) rescue workers use a tracked vehicle to move through an area destroyed by the tsunami in Palu. Image: Carl Court/Getty Images Doctors Without Borders has also deployed a local team to Central Sulawesi. The team includes medical, logistics, and water and sanitation specialists. 2. Consider ways to help the most vulnerable communities. Natural disasters affect people in different ways, but the most vulnerable communities are often overlooked in the aftermath. Humanity and Inclusion, a U.S.-based not-for-profit that promotes disability rights, is taking donations for basic aid and rehabilitation care for tsunami survivors with serious injuries and disabilities. Thousands of people have been left homeless from the tsunami, in addition to locals who were already experiencing homelessness. Consider donating to local, national, or international organisations that are trying to address the immediate crisis of homelessness. Oxfam, for example, is working with local Indonesian partners to deliver essential aid like emergency shelters, soap and sanitary items, water containers, tarps, and toilets. Some of the most vulnerable survivors of a natural disaster are the youngest among us. Consider supporting nonprofit groups that serve children. Save the Children is on the ground in Sulawesi, providing medical care, emotional support, and child-friendly spaces in shelters with diapers and cribs. 3. Keep checking in after the headlines have faded The fallout after a natural disaster is immense, but it eventually stops making headlines. Once the media coverage has ebbed, those affected by the disaster still have to piece together their lives. Keep checking in with your chosen charity to see how things are progressing, and check situation updates from the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance (AHA Center). Finally, if you need guidance on deciding which cause to support amongst so many worthy aid and recovery efforts, consult Charity Navigator's tips for how to give in a crisis. Strategies include giving money instead of material items and making long-term donations.","A magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the Indonesian island region of Sulawesi on Friday.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","If you needed a visual representation of our global environmental crisis in 2018, it doesn’t get much better (well, worse) than the gigantic iceberg looming over the village of Innaarsuit in Greenland, now seen from the vantage of space. Last week, news outlets began reporting that an alarmingly large iceberg had drifted close to Innaarsuit, a village of about 170 people on Greenland’s west coast. Folks were concerned the iceberg could crack apart and generate a dangerous tsunami wave, a fear stoked by memories of last summer, when a freak tsunami wave flooded the western Greenland village of Nuugaatsiaq, killing four people. By Friday, state broadcaster KNR reported that folks in a “danger zone” had been evacuated. Meanwhile, photos and video footage of the ‘berg were going viral far beyond Greenland’s icy shores because, well, just take a look: Denise Holland, a researcher at New York University who has been organizing field campaigns to Greenland for nearly a decade, said that icebergs such as this one “can be extremely unstable.” “If they roll or break apart, they can cause great hardship and possible loss of life for the residents of the village,” Holland told Earther via email. “One main way in or out of Innaarsuit is by boat, and this iceberg will undoubtedly also be a logistical nightmare for those trying to move around.” Things have been looking up since the weekend, when KNR reports that the iceberg drifted about 500-600 meters further north, causing authorities to lift evacuation orders. But according to KNR, a new danger zone includes the village’s power plant, so Innaarsuit isn’t quite out of the woods yet. On Tuesday, the European Space Agency released a satellite image snapped by Sentinel-2A on July 9 that offers another striking visual of the village’s predicament. The ‘berg, which ESA says weighs approximately 10 million tons, looms large over the village, which wouldn’t even be visible if the space agency didn’t helpfully circle it in red. Icebergs have always posed a risk to folks living in the far north. But in our current era of rapid climate change, events like this are a stark reminder of how changing ice conditions uniquely threaten the people of the Arctic. As global temperatures rise, Arctic sea ice is vanishing. Greenland is also losing a tremendous amount of ice as some of its largest coastal glaciers accelerate toward the sea. Changes to ice are disrupting Arctic shipping and affecting subsistence hunting traditions that have sustained villages for generations. Calving events that produce large, dangerous icebergs also seem to be happening more and more. Last month, Holland captured video footage of an iceberg roughly the size of lower Manhattan breaking off Helheim Glacier on Greenland’s east coast.","If you needed a visual representation of our global environmental crisis in 2018, it doesn’t get much better (well, worse) than the gigantic iceberg looming over the village of Innaarsuit in Greenland, now seen from the vantage of space.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Indonesia quake looter: ""We need to eat"" Volunteers have begun burying victims of Indonesia's deadly earthquake and tsunami in a mass grave. The disaster devastated swathes of Sulawesi island and has left at least 844 people dead. Four days after the natural disaster hit, some remote areas have yet to be contacted. A lack of heavy lifting equipment is hampering rescuers' attempts to reach people who remain alive in the ruins of collapsed buildings. ""Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. Dozens of people are feared to be underneath the rubble of one hotel alone, the Roa-Roa in the devastated coastal resort of Palu. Yenni Suryani, of Catholic Relief Services, said aid agencies were struggling to get staff into affected areas as the main airport at Palu was damaged, landslides had cut road links and ""power is out almost everywhere"". Some survivors have been looting shops for food, water and fuel, telling reporters they have run out of supplies. Reuters news agency reports that police are escorting aid convoys to prevent supplies being stolen. President Joko Widodo has welcomed offers of international help. On a visit to the region, the president urged a ""day and night"" effort to rescue survivors. Meanwhile, government officials say some 1,200 inmates escaped from three prisons in the region as the quake struck.

The authorities say they want to prevent an outbreak of disease caused by decomposing bodies. In the hills above Palu, AFP news agency reports, volunteers filling a mass grave were instructed to prepare for a total of 1,300 victims to arrive. Trucks arrived with bodies wrapped in orange, yellow and black bags. They were dragged into the grave and motorised diggers poured earth on top. But many people are still looking for missing loved ones. Adi told AFP he was hugging his wife by the beach in Palu when the tsunami struck, and has not seen her since.

She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. ""We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live."" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies. A few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: ""They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer."" Rows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood. People's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open. Why was the tsunami so destructive? The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami. The earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis. A sophisticated tsunami warning system was put in place across the whole Pacific region after the 2004 disaster, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people. A tsunami warning was issued after the earthquake hit on Friday, but many people in Palu did not receive alerts because of power cuts caused by the tremor. There were also no sirens located along the coast. Videos show people screaming as waves 6m (20ft) high power over the beach - where a festival was being set-up - sweeping up everything in their path. Indonesia, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries, lies on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide and many of the world's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.

"Matt Rivers, Jo Shelley and Ben Westcott, CNN","(CNN) Desperation is growing in the stricken Indonesian city of Palu, as residents faced a fifth day without adequate supplies of food and clean drinking water, amid a sharp rise in the official death toll following Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami. Indonesia's national disaster agency said the number of people killed in the disaster had risen to 1,234 on Tuesday. The toll is expected to continue to climb in the coming days as bodies continue to be retrieved from under the rubble. The situation for those left alive has grown increasingly dire, as families scramble to get even the most basic of goods. On Tuesday, motorists lined up for hours around the block in the blazing sun, standing among the ruins and debris, in the hope of obtaining a small amount of gas. At the last available gas pump in town, large group of men crowd around a single overworked attendant. In his hand is a wad of cash nearly too big to grip. Money though is of little use when their is nothing left to buy. Roads to Palu -- a city of 350,000 people -- remain blocked and aid has been slow to trickle in. Indonesian vessels carrying food and water has still yet to arrive. Indonesian military have been patrolling the streets in Palu over the past 24 hours to crack down looting by desperate survivors, searching for limited supplies and goods. An official from the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent described the situation on the ground as ""nightmarish."" Bodies of victims remain unburied on the side of the roads. In a public cemetery on the outskirts of the city, workers are digging a mass grave the size of a football pitch to try to bury as many bodies as quickly as possible before disease begins to spread. Almost 200 bodies are in this pit alone, with more still being added every hour. A few ID cards lie on the ground next to the pit, but not all bodies have been identified before they were laid to rest. Amid the long wait for supplies and aid, the desperate search continues for survivors with reports of more than 700 houses buried under a mudslide in a nearby town, which still remain unexplored. 'I need to get the kids out of here' An estimated 2.4 million people have been affected by the disaster, according to Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. He said Tuesday that 799 were injured, and more than 61,000 people have been displaced. In total, Sutopo said 66,000 homes had been destroyed so far. Desperate to leave the scene of the disaster and escape the treat of looting, thousands of locals were queuing at Palu airport with children and belongings in the hope of a way out. ""People are trying to get stuff from my house so I needed to get the kids out of here... they're trying to rob us,"" one local woman told CNN Monday as she waited in line at the airport. While some residents are battling to escape the surrounding area, international aid organizations and Indonesian military are trying their hardest to reach as much of the region as possible. Palates of supplies are en route to the affected area courtesy of the organization like the Red Cross, who sent seven tons of logistical supplies from Jakarta on Tuesday. Countries from around the world have begun to announce aid packages for Indonesia as well. Australia, one of the country's closest neighbors, said it had already provided $500,000 of support immediately through the Indonesian Red Cross. ""Australia has some expertise and has resources in particular areas we can deploy, and we are looking to see how we can best fit the need,"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday. The United States announced it had released $100,000 in initial disaster assistance on Monday, according to a state department spokesman. But on the ground, there's little evidence so far of the pledged aid with shipments expected to arrive in the days ahead.","Desperation is growing in the stricken Indonesian city of Palu, as residents faced a fifth day without adequate supplies of food and clean drinking water, amid a sharp rise in the official death toll following Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami.",2018-10-02T08:09:11Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","More than 1,200 were killed in Indonesia quake and tsunami",https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/asia/indonesia-palu-tsunami-earthquake-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181002151513-03-palu-tuesday-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,tsunami,1

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake struck roughly 22.4 miles (36 kilometers) offshore centered about 25 miles (40 km) into the Pacific Ocean from the town of Acari. CNBC reported that local officials said one man was killed by a rock in Yauca. Beyond that, there were some indications that the damage may not be as grim as originally reported. Per the BBC, Health Minister Abel Salinas disputed reports that 17 miners had gone missing inside a collapsed shaft. Reports of another death in Bella Union were also disputed by local officials. Per CNN, the National Civil Defense Institute reported at least 65 additional injuries “in the cities of Arequipa, Ica and Ayacucho.” The casualty count is likely to rise as emergency personnel continue to look through rubble. Though the U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center warned that a wall of water could come crashing onto the shoreline, fortunately no such tsunami actually occurred and the center later advised that the threat had passed. Earthquakes of magnitude 7 and higher are considered major events with the possibility of serious damage or casualties; only an estimated 20 or so occur each year. A magnitude 8.0 quake in 2007 off the central coast of Peru was estimated to have killed well over 500 people and destroyed tens of thousands of buildings. Earthquakes are fairly common in Peru due to its proximity to massive fault lines, as the Christian Science Monitor noted in 2013: Peru is located on the “Ring of Fire,” the belt of earthquakes and volcanoes surrounding the Pacific Ocean. All along its western coast, the South American plate is colliding with the Nazca plate, forcing the heavier ocean crust down into the Earth’s mantle. The collision of the plates is like a slow-motion car wreck. They’re colliding at only 3 inches per year, but that’s enough to cause frequent earthquakes—and build the Andes Mountains. The tectonically active region along the coast of South America, known to geologists as the South American arc, is more than 4,000 miles long, from just below the southern tip of Chile to just off the coast of Panama. Despite the high risk throughout Peru, though, the situation with regards to preparation for seismic events (particularly in construction and building standards) is not so good. A 2012 review found the capital city of Lima, with a population of over nine million, could suffer tens of thousands dead and hundreds of thousands injured if an 8.0 magnitude earthquake hits there.

Coastal residents near Indonesia's Anak Krakatau volcano have been warned to keep away from beaches amid fears it could trigger a new tsunami.
On Saturday, giant waves crashed into coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java, killing at least 222 people and injuring 843.
It is thought that volcanic activity set off undersea landslides which in turn generated the killer waves.
Anak Krakatau was erupting again on Sunday, spewing ash and smoke.
Video shot from a charter plane captured the magnitude of the event in the Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java.
President Joko Widodo has expressed his sorrow for the victims and urged people to be patient.
Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads but heavy lifting equipment is being transported to badly hit areas to help search for victims.
What warning was given?
The head of the National Disaster Management Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, held a news conference on Java.
""Recommendations from [the] Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while,"" he said.

""The potential for a fresh tsunami is still possible because the volcanic eruption of Anak Krakatau continues to occur, potentially triggering tsunami.""
Anak Krakatau, which formed in 1927 after the Krakatoa volcano eruption, has seen increased activity in recent months with people asked to avoid the area around its crater. 
On Friday it erupted for two minutes and 12 seconds, creating an ash cloud that rose 400 metres above the mountain. 
Why was Saturday's tsunami so deadly?
It struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake.
Seawater did not recede as in an earthquake tsunami and experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time.
However, officials say a warning siren did go off in some areas, Reuters news agency reports.

 Band Seventeen were performing on stage when the tsunami hit
The waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java.
Footage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen was performing. 
Members of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage.
Officials say more than 160 people were killed in Java's Pandeglang tourist district.
On Sumatra, 48 were reported dead in South Lampung, and deaths were also reported in Serang district and Tanggamus.
So far, no foreign nationals have been reported dead, officials say.
What caused the tsunami?
By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent
It is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate large waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water. 
Except, unlike in a classic earthquake-driven tsunami in which the seafloor will thrust up or down, it seems an eruption event set in motion some kind of slide. 
It is not clear at this stage whether part of the flank of the volcano has collapsed with material entering the sea and pushing water ahead of it, or if movement on the flank has triggered a rapid slump in sediment under the water surface. 
The latter at this stage appears to be the emerging consensus, but the effect is the same - the water column is disturbed and waves propagate outwards. 
How common are tsunamis in Indonesia?
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit
Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.
In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.
On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.
However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.
Krakatoa (Krakatau in Indonesian)
Image copyrightOystein Lund Andersen
In August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history:
Massive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people
Thousands more were killed by hot ash
The eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945
The eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away
World temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year
The volcanic island virtually disappeared

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
Regardless of how any business leader personally feels about data-privacy regulations, they seem destined to grow stronger.
In December, a coalition of more than 200 banks, retailers and tech companies called on Congress to draft stricter privacy legislation. Coalition members said they believed that all companies should be subject to the same rules, regardless of their size or industry, and that there should be a national standard for data-breach notifications.
The fact that private industry was itself calling for legislation is significant. Companies are now acutely aware of the financial and public relations fallout from data breaches, so much so that they are actually asking lawmakers to hold them to higher standards. The public is equally anxious about data privacy.
Related: The Very Strong Business Case for Complying With the World’s Toughest Data Protection Regulation
And it's that combination that makes it extremely likely that tougher data regulations are headed down the pipeline.
All this comes on the heels of the General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) implementation in the European Union last spring, plus the passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act last summer. Congressional Democrats and Republicans are currently butting heads on the issue, with the GOP interested only in a federal law that would supersede any state regulations.
What does small business think of all this? Considering that California's law goes into effect in January 2020 and that nearly every other state has proposed various data privacy legislation, small businesses are obviously eager to avoid a potential patchwork of state laws. The regulatory waters are already choppy enough.
Some industries, like finance, are accustomed to data regulations. Considering the scope of potential new regulations, that finance sector experience won’t count for much, however. For the simple fact is that every company in America needs to prepare for new compliance challenges throughout 2019.
Have you thought about what compliance means to you?
The costs 
Most companies expect pending regulations to be modeled on the GDPR that now applies to every business serving customers in the European Union. GDPR levies fines for every single record that is exposed in a breach, meaning fines can run into the millions (or even billions) of euros (do the math for $U.S.).
If the size of those numbers is troubling, consider the likelihood of a fine. Forthcoming regulations will obligate companies to take a whole new approach to data and customer engagement. Adjusting to complex, wide-ranging new regulations won’t be easy. Companies may be eager to comply but find themselves in trouble because they’re unable.
The ever-increasing threat of cybercrime is another worry. Today’s hackers are both tenacious and sophisticated, making cybersecurity incredibly difficult to ensure. Following whatever regulations are released won’t make companies immune to attack or exempt from fines -- though it will make them better protected than they are today.
Making compliance simple and certain
We don’t yet know what form any new regulations might take or how they would affect individual companies. Luckily, the details are not necessary for businesses to begin building a better approach to compliance. The goal is to make managing compliance simultaneously easier and more consistent. Start with these steps:
1. Collect data from across channels. 
Don’t think of data as ""regulated"" versus ""unregulated."" All data is potentially sensitive, so instead of protecting some data, companies should begin protecting all data equally. That starts with busineses being able to collect data from as many sources as possible for storage on one platform that’s been standardized for compliance.
Related: The Feds and the States Are Embracing Privacy Law; What That Means to Your Business
Xerox recognized the value of standardization when, in 2017, it established an Office of Compliance, which strives to create a positive corporate compliance culture by helping employees do diligent work, and ensuring that senior leaders and all members of management send consistent messages. This office also constantly reviews and updates corporate policies to align with evolving regulatory and legal requirements.
Such top-down coordination will be essential once fast-moving data in multiple formats becomes subject to privacy laws. Think of it as a dedicated compliance team that's entrusted to stay abreast of each new development and respond accordingly.
Companies of all sizes should copy Xerox and make an effort to codify their compliance protocols -- the sooner, the better. Just make sure to stay open to the possibility of procedural changes, as forthcoming regulations will surely require flexibility as they are introduced and enacted.
2. Facilitate internal and external audits.
Audits are crucial for compliance. Complying with auditors often means turning over massive amounts of information. Alternately, conducting internal audits allows companies to find and correct issues before the regulators even arrive. In either case, companies need to have on-demand access to all their data; otherwise, any kind of audit is a burden.
Having all data on a platform accessible with unified search makes retrieval basically effortless. Nikon understands that a fast response is important -- so much so that it has developed independent systems. These systems enable the company's internal audit department to review compliance with laws and regulations, as well as with internal rules, without interference from operational divisions.
An overview of each department’s annual activities -- to determine primarily whether divisions' operations are being conducted in accordance with laws and regulations, as well as to create proposals for improvement -- is provided to the company’s executive committee and board of directors.
Picture how much easier external investigations will be to manage after your company performs numerous dry runs. Practice makes perfect. As regulations evolve over the course of 2019 and beyond, reacting and adapting fast will be key. Get a head start by instituting a system of internal audits as soon as you can.
3. Practice good governance.
Regulations dictate how a company must act both before and after a breach. Because of that increased scrutiny, companies must become hyperaware of data security. If, for instance, a breach went undetected, and therefore unreported, the resulting fine could be multiplied. Considering how unpredictable cybersecurity can be, companies need to have plans and policies detailing exactly how to act after a breach.
Related: Three Reasons Why Your Startup Needs A Corporate Governance Playbook
General Electric helps its global workforce keep compliance top of mind by employing about 800 compliance leaders and more than 600 part-time ombudsmen to serve as sounding boards.
Instead of trying to sweep compliance issues under the rug, GE confronts them head-on, ensuring that concerns are heard and addressed, and utilizing a hotline where employees can report any compliance concerns. Workers can also go to their managers with those concerns. The idea is that honest, open dialogue among all parties will stop many problems before they have a chance to start.
Every company should follow GE's lead. Sure, you likely don't have hundreds of employees to commit to the task, but having a layered network of oversight will help eliminate blind spots and stay on top of new legislation.
Avoiding hefty fines and negative publicity is important, but penalties are not the core reason to care about compliance in 2019. What is: Customers care about their private data and are tired of seeing companies misuse it.
In that way, regulators are paving a path for companies to thrive in a future economy driven entirely by data.",Compliance will be an increasingly challenging business issue in 2019.

"Fergus Jensen, Reuters","LABUAN - Indonesian military and rescue teams fanned out across a stretch of coastline on Monday, hoping to find survivors of a tsunami triggered by a landslide from a volcano that killed at least 373 people.
Thick clouds of ash spewed from Anak Krakatau, a volcanic island where a crater collapse at high tide late on Saturday set off waves that smashed into coastal areas on both sides of the Sunda Strait between the islands of Sumatra and Java.
Rescuers used heavy machinery and bare hands to dig bodies out of mud and wreckage along a 100 km (60 mile) stretch of Java's west coast.
More than 1,400 people were injured, and about 12,000 residents had to move to higher ground, with a high-tide warning extended to Wednesday.
The vast archipelago, which sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade.
Earthquakes flattened parts of the island of Lombok in July and August, and a double quake-and-tsunami killed more than 2,000 people on a remote part of Sulawesi island in September.
""At least 373 people have died, while 128 people are currently missing,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said on Monday evening.
Saturday's tsunami destroyed more than 700 buildings, from small shops and houses to villas and hotels. It took just 24 minutes after the landslide for waves to hit land, and there was no early warning for those living on the coast.
""EVERYTHING IS DESTROYED""
Vehicles were crushed by waves that lifted chunks of metal, felled trees, wooden beams and household items and deposited them on roads and rice fields.
Nurjana, 20, ran uphill after the tsunami hit. Her beachside snack stall was washed away.
""I opened the door straight away and saved myself. I jumped over the wall,"" she said. ""Everything is destroyed.""
Out in the strait, Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was still erupting on Sunday night, belching white smoke and ash into the sky.
The meteorology agency that an area of about 64 hectares, or 90 soccer pitches, of the volcanic island had collapsed into the sea.
In 1883, the volcano then known as Krakatoa erupted in one of the biggest blasts in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunami, and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash. Anak Krakatau is the island that emerged from the area in 1927, and has been growing ever since.
The high waves isolated hundreds of people on Sebesi island, about 12 km from the volcano.
""We are completely paralysed,"" Syamsiar, a village secretary on the island, told Metro TV, calling for food and medicine.
President Joko Widodo, who is running for re-election in April, told disaster agencies to install early warning systems, but experts said that, unlike with tsunami caused by earthquakes, little could have been done to alert people that waves were coming.
MEMORIES OF 2004
""Tsunamis from volcanic flank collapse are generated right at the coast and often close to populations,"" said Eddie Dempsey, lecturer in structural geology at Britain's University of Hull.
""The interval between the volcanic collapse and the arrival of the waves is minimal.""
The timing of the disaster over the Christmas season evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
Families streamed out of the area on Monday for fear of further tsunami, jamming roads already blocked by debris.
Fishermen told how a light breeze was followed by a huge wave that smashed together wooden fishing boats moored off the coast and pulled down the trees they were tied to.
Excavators were being used to move debris including piles of steel roofing tangled like spaghetti. Medics were sent in with the military, while groups of police and soldiers reached remote areas.
One team used sniffer dogs to search for survivors at the beach club where a tsunami washed away an outdoor stage where the Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing at a party for about 200 guests. They had already pulled out nine bodies that day.
At a village 20 km away, district chief Atmadja Suhara said he was helping to care for 4,000 refugees, many of them now homeless.

Reuters Editorial,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The U.S. region most vulnerable to tsunamis - the massive waves of water unleashed by undersea earthquakes - is dangerously under-prepared, experts and officials in Oregon and Washington state said after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake this week. The quake that struck in the Gulf of Alaska late Monday, triggering a tsunami warning for Alaska and a tsunami watch for the U.S. West Coast, rekindled concerns that a seismic sea wave along the northwest coast could kill, injure or displace tens of thousands of people and cause billions of dollars in damage. In this week’s quake, the warnings and watches were quickly lifted, and there was no damage from the slight change it caused in the ocean. But experts worry that in some parts of the region there is too little information about where tsunamis might occur, and in others too much infrastructure built in locations known to face a threat. “There’s still a lot that needs to be done,” said Corina Forson, Washington’s chief hazards geologist. Scientists in the state have pinpointed just half the locations where a destructive tsunami triggered by the Cascadia subduction zone off the northwest coast might come ashore, and about 10 percent of sites that might be hit by a wave emanating from the Seattle fault zone, Forson said. She called the lack of information dangerous. A tsunami could send a wall of water 50 feet (15 meters) high crashing onto the coast, or a wave 16 feet (5 meters) high into Seattle, the state’s largest city, she said. “If there’s the real thing and people don’t have evacuation routes and plans, they won’t know where to get to safety and it could be life-threatening,” she said. In neighboring Oregon, officials have created evacuation plans and public awareness campaigns to help people prepare. But the state has not done enough to stop people from building in potential danger zones, said Jay Wilson, former chairman of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission. “There are about 30,000 people who live in the tsunami zones,” Wilson said. “If we do everything right, they’re going to run up to the top of the hill. And then they’re all going to be permanently displaced.” DEADLY THREAT Parts of Oregon and far northern California have up to a 37 percent chance of a tsunami from a rupture of the Cascadia subduction zone in the next 50 years, said Chris Goldfinger, a tsunami and earthquake expert with the Oregon State University. Tsunamis are generally produced when tectonic plates move against each other under the ocean in subduction zones, displacing ocean water through powerful quakes. They have a deadly history. The 2011 quake and tsunami in Japan killed up to 18,000 people and wrecked Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant, causing the worst meltdown since the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union. The 2004 Asian tsunami killed 226,000 people. A big tsunami on the Oregon coast could kill up to 10,000 people, said Althea Rizzo, the state’s geologic hazards program coordinator. In recent years, Oregon has instituted practice drills at schools and hospitals, provided evacuation materials to tourists in their hotel rooms and in some areas painted blue evacuation lines to higher ground on roads and paths, Rizzo said. The city of Seaside, Oregon, voted in 2016 to fund a bond measure to move its schools out of the inundation zone. There are statewide restrictions on building essential facilities like hospitals in tsunami zones. But updated maps showing where those zones are located have not been incorporated into the law, meaning the restrictions might not apply in areas that are now known to be dangerous, Wilson said. “In the Northwest our biggest problem is not getting the word out, it’s that our built infrastructure is very vulnerable,” said Goldfinger. “Buildings within a tsunami zone are pretty much going to be destroyed.” California is considering adopting international zoning standards for tsunami zone construction, as well as “blue line” evacuation routes like those in Oregon, said Rick Wilson, senior engineering geologist for the California Geological Survey. In Manzanita on the Oregon coast, resident Kerry Driscoll said she has an evacuation plan and the cabins at the beachside resort where she works are equipped with pamphlets telling tourists how to prepare. But tsunamis can come with little warning, and she knows it might be hard to get out. “If we don’t have major advance warning I don’t think there’s much that we can do,” Driscoll said. “I can’t see running from giant tidal waves.” Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Frances Kerry","SACRAMENTO, Calif.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"A powerful earthquake struck Taiwan today, causing damage and a partially collapsed hotel building, sources report. The USGS reports that the magnitude 6.4 quake struck 21 kilometers (13 miles) north of the city of Hualien at 10:50 U.S. Eastern Time, at a shallow 9.5 kilometers (6 miles) below the surface. No tsunami warnings have been issued. The English-language Taiwan News and the BBC report that a number of buildings have collapsed in Hualien City, including a roof of a hotel. There are no reports of injuries yet. Residents as far away as Taipei (around 120 kilometers (75 miles) north) could feel tremors. This is the second powerful earthquake in the area in just a few days. A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck in nearly the same spot on Sunday (Monday Taiwan time). Taiwan’s location on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire means they’re no stranger to tremors. Many of the country’s buildings are built to withstand some shaking. With a quake of this size there’s always the potential for aftershocks. “We haven’t seen any large enough here to record yet,” John Bellini from the USGS told Gizmodo. “But don’t have the local instrumentation they would have. I wouldn’t be surprised for there to be a number of aftershocks in the next couple of days.” This story is developing. We will update the post when we know more.

,"At a Glance At least 1,234 people were killed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Officials fear the death toll will continue to jump, with several coastal towns still cut off. The quake also triggered a tsunami, according to Indonesia's geophysics agency. At a press conference, Indonesian officials announced Tuesday that the death toll had increased to 1,234 from a devastating earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, and about 800 others were severely injured. Rescue officials worried that the extent of the disaster could escalate even further with several large coastal towns still isolated because of damaged roads and downed communication lines. The country's disaster agency said nearly all of the victims were from the devastated city of Palu on Sulawesi. ""The death toll is believed to increase further since many bodies were still under the wreckage, while many have not been reached,"" said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. A mass burial for more than 500 bodies was held Sunday for health and religious reasons; the majority of Palu's inhabitants are Muslim. Late Monday night, there was some good news: crews were able to rescue a 38-year-old man trapped for three days under the rubble of a collapsed building in Palu. The survivor, identified as Sapri Nusin, was conscious as he was seen on Indonesian TV being rescued. Hundreds are still waiting to be evacuated from Palu as concerns about food and fuel shortages mount. ""We feel like we are stepchildren here because all the help is going to Palu,"" said Mohamad Taufik, 38, from the town of Donggala, who said five of his relatives are still missing. ""There are many young children here who are hungry and sick, but there is no milk or medicine."" Along the coast, the tsunami, which reportedly reached as high as 6 meters (nearly 20 feet) in some places, shattered buildings, uprooted concrete and thrust houses and boats tens of meters inland. Nugroho said more people remain trapped in Sigi and Balaroa, meaning the toll is likely to rise. More aid was being distributed, he added, but ""we still need more time to take care of all the problems."" He said 153 bodies were buried Monday in a mass grave and that the operation continued Tuesday. Rescuers try to pull 15-year old earthquake victim Nurul Istikharah from her damaged house Sunday, Sept. 30, 2018, in Palu, Indonesia. (AP Photo/Arimacs Wilander) A special aircraft carrying more than 3,000 gallons of fuel had arrived and trucks with food were on the way with police escorts to guard against looters. Nugroho said many gas stations were inoperable either because of quake damage or from people stealing fuel. Desperation was visible in Palu. Signs propped along roads read ""We Need Food"" and ""We Need Support,"" while children begged for cash in the streets and long lines of cars snarled traffic as people waited for gas. Teams were searching for trapped survivors under destroyed homes and buildings, including a collapsed eight-story hotel in Palu, but they needed more heavy equipment to clear the rubble. Nearly 62,000 people have been displaced from their homes, Nugroho said. Many people were believed trapped under shattered houses in the Palu neighbourhood of Balaroa, where the earthquake caused the ground to heave up and down violently. ""I and about 50 other people in Balaroa were able to save ourselves by riding on a mound of soil which was getting higher and higher,"" resident Siti Hajat told MetroTV, adding that her house was destroyed. Nugroho said generators, heavy equipment and tents are among the most-needed aid items. The countries that offered assistance include the United States and China, he said. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday that his government has given $360,000 to help victims and is in talks with Indonesian authorities about the second round of aid. The initial funds are to go to the Indonesian Red Cross for the most obvious emergency aid needs, such as tarpaulins. The coastline at Palu was strewn with rubble and a few brightly coloured cargo containers poking out of the water. Buildings near the water were ruined shells. The arches of a large yellow bridge rested in the water and eerie drone video showed a Ferris wheel, untouched, on a beach scraped bare by the waves. Indonesia is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. A powerful quake on the island of Lombok killed 505 people in August, and two moderate quakes near an eastern island on Tuesday reportedly damaged a bridge. The vast archipelago is home to 260 million people on more than 17,000 islands that stretch a distance similar to that between New York and London. Roads and infrastructure are poor in many areas, making access difficult in the best of conditions.","The Weather Channel A Desperate Search for Survivors as the Earthquake, Tsunami Claims 1234 Lives in Indonesia The Weather Channel At least 1,234 people were killed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.

Emily Sullivan,"As people along the East Coast, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean were preparing for their day around 8:30 a.m. ET, a smartphone push notification warned some of them of a possible tsunami. The threat, as it turned out, was nonexistent. The National Weather Service tells NPR that it was a ""test message"" released by at least one private company as an official warning. In a statement, spokesperson Susan Buchanan said: ""The National Tsunami Warning Center of the National Weather Service issued a routine test message at approximately 8:30 am ET this morning. The test message was released by at least one private sector company as an official Tsunami Warning, resulting in widespread reports of tsunami warnings received via phones and other media across the East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean."" The federal agency issued a tweet addressing the incident over an hour after the false warning was delivered. The NWS would not elaborate on how widespread the warnings were, but said the agency is currently looking into why the test message was communicated as an actual tsunami warning. The NWS says neither the agency nor its National Tsunami Warning Center division were responsible for the false push notification, which they say was misinterpreted and issued as an official warning by ""at least one"" private sector company. The error comes weeks after a false ballistic missile alert in Hawaii declaring ""THIS IS NOT A DRILL"" advised Hawaii residents and tourists to seek immediate shelter. The alert issued by the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency was sent at 8:07 a.m local time. It took until 8:20 a.m. for the agency to post to its Twitter and Facebook accounts that there was no missile threat to Hawaii. It took the agency a full 38 minutes after it had sent the false alert to issue a correction through the emergency alert system. The alert was issued because emergency worker believed there really was a missile threat, according to a preliminary investigation by the Federal Communications Commission.

James Martin,"Water leaking from the damaged reactors has to be stored on site at Fukushima Daiichi. 
The fuel rods in the three damaged radioactive units need to be continuously cooled with fresh water, but Tepco must collect and store the leaking (and now contaminated) water.
In the eight years since the accident, that has meant Tepco has collected more than 1.1 million tons of leaking, contaminated water.
Where does it all go? There are currently 900 huge silos on site and counting. Tepco estimates it has enough space in the 37.7-million-square-foot facility to house an additional 270,000 tons of water, which means it will run out space to store any more water sometime in 2020.

Camila Domonoske,"Updated at 2:05 p.m. ET A magnitude 7.0 earthquake has hit southern Alaska, with its epicenter just north of Anchorage. A tsunami warning was temporarily issued for coastal regions of Cook Inlet and the Southern Kenai Peninsula, but it has since been canceled. The earthquake struck just before 8:30 a.m. local time (12:29 p.m. ET). The epicenter was about 8 miles north of Anchorage, at a depth of some 25 miles. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, some of them strong. The original earthquake powerfully shook Anchorage, the most populous city in Alaska. Some schools and businesses across the city are closing for the day.

Jennifer Calfas,"Residents on the East Coast, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean had a startling start to their Tuesday morning after the National Weather Service accidentally sent out a tsunami warning push notification to mobile phones. The foreboding message was a mistake during a regularly scheduled test from the National Tsunami Center, the National Weather Service said in a statement to TIME. “The test message was released by at least one private sector company as an official Tsunami Warning, resulting in widespread reports of tsunami warnings received via phones and other media across the East Coast, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean,” the NWS said. “We’re currently looking into why the test message was communicated as an actual tsunami warning,” the statement said. The warning was sent at around 8:30 a.m. EST Tuesday. Regional agencies scrambled to clarify the mistake, sending out a slew of messages to make it as clear as possible that the warning was made in error. “NO current Tsunami Warning, Advisory, Watch, or Threat for the U.S. East Coast,” the NWS’s Eastern Region tweeted Tuesday morning. “Repeat, a Tsunami Warning is NOT in effect,” tweeted the NWS for Key West. “Please note there is NO TSUNAMI THREAT FOR New England,” tweeted the NWS for Boston. The NWS is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Some recipients of the message posted images of it on social media, with some showing the alert in the AccuWeather app. Other images showed language clarifying that the push notifications were sent out as a test could be seen once the notification was opened. A representative from AccuWeather did not respond immediately to a request for comment. While startling for some, the mistake Tuesday morning did not appear to have the same impact as a more severe one did in Hawaii last month when an emergency alert warning of a ballistic missile threat was mistakenly sent to residents. The all-caps message, which told people to “SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER” and that “THIS IS NOT A DRILL,” sparked panic and chaos on the tropical islands as residents called their loved ones and sought shelter. That mistake was not corrected until 38 minutes later. On the West Coast in January, residents were correctly issued tsunami warnings following an earthquake in the Gulf of Alaska.

"Fergus Jensen, Reuters","SUMUR, Indonesia - Indonesian rescue teams on Wednesday struggled to reach remote areas on the western coast of Java amid an ""extreme weather"" rain warning after a tsunami killed more than 400 people last week.
Heavy rain lashed fishing villages along the coast, muddying roads and holding up convoys delivering heavy machinery and aid to isolated areas while authorities urged residents to stay away from the shore in case of further waves.
Clouds of ash spewed from the nearby Anak Krakatau, or child of Krakatau, almost obscuring the volcanic island where a crater collapse at high tide on Saturday sent waves up to 5 meters (16 feet) high smashing into the coast on the Sunda Strait, between Java and Sumatra islands.
Indonesia's meteorology agency (BMKG) said the rough weather could make the volcano's crater more fragile.
""We have developed a monitoring system focused specifically on the volcanic tremors at Anak Krakatau so that we can issue early warnings,"" said BMKG head Dwikorita Karnawati, adding that a 2-kilometer exclusion zone had been imposed.
The confirmed death toll is 430, with at least 159 people missing. Nearly 1,500 people were injured and over 21,000 people have evacuated to higher ground.
A state of emergency has been declared until Jan. 4, which authorities hope will make it easier to deploy assistance, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency.
Search and rescue teams were focused on the town of Sumur near the southwest tip of Java, but ""the roads are damaged and clogged"" and helicopters had to be deployed to carry out assessments and evacuations, he added.
Volunteers were having to piece together makeshift bridges out of concrete blocks after the waves washed away infrastructure along the coast.
Indonesia is a vast archipelago that sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"". This year, the country has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade.
The latest disaster, coming during the Christmas season, evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
The Saturday evening tsunami followed the collapse of an area of the volcano island of about 64 hectares (222 acres), or about 90 soccer pitches.
The waves engulfed fishing villages and holiday resorts, leaving a coast littered with the matchwood of homes, crushed vehicles and fallen trees. Children's toys and rides at a seaside carnival in Sumur were left scattered along a swampy beach.
The surge of seawater also left dozens of turtles, weighing several kilograms, stranded on land, and some volunteer rescuers worked to carry them back to the sea.
On Sebesi Island in the middle of the Sunda Strait, helicopters had been dispatched to evacuate residents.
Along the coast, thousands of people are staying in tents and temporary shelters like mosques or schools, with dozens sleeping on the floor or in crowded public facilities. Rice and instant noodles have been delivered to many shelters, but clean water, wet weather gear, fresh clothes, and blankets are in short supply, some evacuees said.
Ade Hasanah, 45, staying in an emergency center with her children, said people were being told not to return to their homes.
""It's safe here,"" she said. ""We hope if the children are safe and the situation is stable, we can go home quickly. We're restless.""
In 1883, the volcano then known as Krakatoa erupted in one of the biggest blasts in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunamis and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash.
Anak Krakatau is the island that emerged from the area in 1927 and has been growing ever since.","Indonesian rescuers struggle against heavy rain to reach tsunami-hit villages ABS-CBN News Indonesian rescuers use drones as tsunami death toll tops 400 GMA News Indonesia says avoid coast near volcano, fearing new tsunami INQUIRER.net Indonesian pop group si…",2018-12-26T09:08:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Abs-cbn.com'}",Indonesian rescuers struggle against heavy rain to reach tsunami-hit villages - ABS-CBN News,https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/12/26/18/indonesian-rescuers-struggle-against-heavy-rain-to-reach-tsunami-hit-villages,https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/news/12/26/20181226-indonesia-tsunami.jpg,,Abs-cbn.com,tsunami,1

MARI YAMAGUCHI / AP,"TOKYO — A powerful earthquake hit wide areas on Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido early Thursday, triggering landslides as well as causing the loss of power at nearly all of 3 million households and a nuclear power plant to go on a backup generator. A magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck southern Hokkaido at 3:08 a.m. Thursday (18:08 GMT Wednesday) at the depth of 40 kilometers (24 miles), Japan’s Meteorological Agency said. The quake’s epicenter was east of the city of Tomakomai. It also struck Hokkaido’s prefectural capital of Sapporo, with a population of 1.9 million. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude at 6.6. No tsunami warning was issued. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said a man was found without vital signs in Tomakomai, and several people were reported missing in the nearby town of Atsuma. At least 20 other people were injured in nearby towns, though their conditions were not immediately known. Footage on NHK national television showed the moment the quake struck Muroran, with its camera violently shaking and all city lights going out a moment later. In nearby Sapporo, a mudslide hit a road, leaving several cars half buried. In the town of Atsuma, a massive landslide occurred on the side of a mountain, crushing houses at lower levels. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference that the authorities have received hundreds of calls about people missing and buildings collapsing. Officials are doing their utmost for the search and rescue while they assess the extent of damage, he said. The central government set up a crisis management taskforce at the prime minister’s Office, Suga said. Three reactors at the Tomari nuclear plant were offline, but they are running on backup generators after losing external power because of the island-wide blackouts that also caused power loss at all 2.9 million households and disrupted traffic, Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority said. Spent fuel in storage pools was safely cooled on backup power that can last for a week, the agency said. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan destroyed both external and backup power to the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, causing meltdowns.

Casualty figures from Saturday night's disaster continued to rise, with at least 373 people confirmed dead and more than 1,400 injured. The death toll was certain to rise further, with 128 people still missing from the affected areas along the coastlines of western Java and southern Sumatra islands, where hundreds of military personnel and volunteers were conducting their grim search along debris-strewn beaches.
Where victims were found, yellow, orange and black body bags were laid out, and weeping relatives identified the dead.
The waves that swept locals and tourists into the sea along the Sunda Strait followed an eruption and apparent landslide on Anak Krakatau, or ""Child of Krakatoa,"" one of the world's most infamous volcanic islands.
Hotels and hundreds of homes were heavily damaged by the waves. Broken chunks of concrete and splintered sticks of wood littered hard-hit coastal areas, turning popular beach areas into near ghost towns. Debris from thatch-bamboo shacks was strewn along the coast.
The Indonesian Medical Association of the worst-affected Banten region said that it sent doctors, medical supplies and equipment, and that many of the injured were in need of orthopedic and neurological surgery. It said most victims are domestic tourists who were visiting beaches during the long weekend ahead of Christmas.
It was the second deadly tsunami to hit seismically active Indonesia this year. A powerful earthquake triggered a tsunami that hit Sulawesi island in September, giving residents a brief warning before the waves struck.
On Saturday night, however, the ground did not shake to alert people before the waves ripped buildings from their foundations and swept terrified concertgoers celebrating on a resort beach into the sea.
""I heard people shouting to run away and I saw the water had gone up to the mainland and the hotel had been flooded by water,"" said witness Feri Ardian. ""About 200 people were dragged away by the waves.""
Dramatic video posted on social media showed the Indonesian pop band Seventeen performing in a tent on Tanjung Lesung beach at a concert for employees of the state-owned electricity company. A wave smashed through the makeshift stage, tossing the band and its equipment into the audience.
Seventeen's bass player, guitarist, drummer, road manager and technician were all killed. The lead singer, Riefian Fajarsyah, survived, but his wife, who was also a backup singer, remains missing.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who faces what promises to be a tough re-election campaign next year, responded Monday to the lack of any warning of the disaster with a vow to have all equipment used for detection of tsunamis replaced or repaired.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency, acknowledged on Twitter that the country's network of detection buoys had been dysfunctional since 2012, due to vandalism and budget shortfalls.
But the head of Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency, Dwikorita Karnawati, said Monday that the tsunami was caused by Krakatau's volcanic activity, so could not have been picked up by her agency's sensors, which monitor the conventional tectonic earthquakes that are responsible for more than 90 per cent of Indonesia's tsunamis.
With Anak Krakatau still erupting, she warned people to avoid activities around coastal areas in the coming days.
The president told journalists after arriving by helicopter in the disaster region that he has ordered the Social Ministry to give compensation to the families of the dead as quickly as possible. He praised the army and police, along with local government officials, for their work in evacuating shorefront areas, which are still considered a danger zone.
Scientists, including those from Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics agency, said the tsunami could have been caused by landslides -- either above ground or underwater -- on the steep slope of the erupting volcano. The scientists also cited tidal waves caused by the full moon.
Gegar Prasetya, co-founder of the Tsunami Research Center Indonesia, said the tsunami was likely caused by a flank collapse -- when a big section of a volcano's slope gives way. It's possible for an eruption to trigger a landslide above ground or beneath the ocean, both capable of producing waves, he said.
The 305-meter (1,000-foot) -high Anak Krakatau lies on an island in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra islands, linking the Indian Ocean and the Java Sea. It has been erupting since June and did so again about 24 minutes before the tsunami, the geophysics agency said.
The volcanic island formed over years after the 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano, one of the largest, most devastating in recorded history. That disaster killed more than 30,000 people, launched far-reaching tsunamis and created so much ash that day was turned to night in the area and a global temperature drop was recorded.
Most of the island sank into a volcanic crater under the sea, and the area remained calm until the 1920s, when Anak Krakatau began to rise from the site. It continues to grow each year and erupts periodically.
Indonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands and home to 260 million people, lies along the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. Roads and infrastructure are poor in many areas, making access difficult in the best of conditions.
A powerful quake on the island of Lombok killed 505 people in August. The tsunami and earthquake that hit Sulawesi in September killed more than 2,100, while thousands more are believed to still be buried in neighbourhoods swallowed by a quake phenomenon known as liquefaction.
Saturday's tsunami also rekindled memories of the massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake that hit Indonesia on Dec. 26, 2004. It spawned a giant tsunami off Sumatra island, killing more than 230,000 people in a dozen countries -- the majority in Indonesia.

As the white strobe lights flashed hypnotically, the bands lead singer screamed into the crowd: We are! We are Seventeen! Seventeen! He then let loose with a long note as the guitarist wailed behind him.
Some in the audience clapped as they sat at beachside tables covered in crisp white linens. Others walked casually across the grass. A small boy wandered among the tables, and a woman in a head scarf moved closer to the stage, her cellphone out and ready to capture the memory of this perfect night, a year-end concert at a popular resort on Java islands west coast.
Then, in a heartbeat, it was all gone.

Indonesia searches for survivors after tsunami kills at least 373
A torrent of water emerged from the darkness like a monster, swallowing the stage and tossing band members, their instruments and all of their equipment into the audience. It was the last moment, caught on video, that most of them would ever know.
The tsunami that roared ashore from the Sunda Strait on Saturday night, killing more than 370 people and injuring over 1,400 on Java and Sumatra islands, was particularly cruel. It hit on a busy holiday weekend when many people were enjoying the warm night breeze on the beach under a full moon.
And unlike most big waves, which are typically portended by an earthquakes violent shaking, this was a stealth attack. There were no major ground convulsions, no sirens, no text messages.

Instead, a volcanic island with an ominous name Anak Krakatau, or Child of Krakatoa rumbled as it has been doing for months before a giant chunk of it apparently broke loose like a rock falling into a tub, silently unleashing disaster.
The perfect atmosphere suddenly changed dramatically in just seconds, recalled Mamad Setiadi, who had helped set up at the Tanjung Lesung Beach Club for the pop band Seventeen, which performed for employees of a state-owned electric company while a comedian simultaneously had audience members laughing in another area of the lawn.
I saw the seawater suddenly rising and pushing everything on the stage, and I instinctively climbed a tree, Setiadi said. From the top of that tree, I witnessed a horror that is difficult for me to describe in words. The seawater drowned everything trees, cars, buses, benches mixed with men, women and children! The sound of music turned into a hysterical scream!
An estimated 500 guests and workers were milling about the resorts grounds when the wall of water surged forward, then sucked back to the sea with such force that survivors had to use most of their strength just to hold on. Seventeens bass player, guitarist, drummer, road manager and technician were all killed. The lead singer, Riefian Fajarsyah, survived, but his wife, a backup singer, remains missing. The comedian and his wife were also killed.

On Monday morning, rescuers found eight more bodies near the hotel, including a boy around 8 years old. Six soldiers in green fatigues carried a body bag through the pool area, the once-gleaming blue water now replaced with mud and debris.
Nearby, only a skeleton of the bands stage remained beside a heap of twisted metal, overturned chairs and splintered sticks of wood. Soggy white tablecloths covered in dirt were strewn across the lawn. Grass and sod were jammed up against a keyboard resting beside broken speakers on the ground.
Fajarsyah vowed not to leave without his wife.
Im still here. Im not going anywhere, he posted online. I will pick you up. We will go home together, darling. Wait for me, Dylan Sahara.
Thousands of soldiers, police and volunteers fanned out across beaches on both affected islands Monday, searching for anyone trapped alive under the debris.

The tsunami did not rise very high or surge far inland, unlike the one that hit Indonesias Sulawesi island in September, killing more than 2,100 people and burying thousands more. But it was still powerful and destructive, with hotels and hundreds of homes heavily damaged or ripped apart.
Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of Indonesias Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency, said the tsunami was probably caused by a landslide on Anak Krakataus steep slope. The 305-meter-high (1,000-foot-high) volcano lies on an island linking the Indian Ocean and the Java Sea. It has been erupting since June and did so again 24 minutes before the tsunami, the agency said.
Satellite imagery showed a 64-hectare (158-acre) deformation on the volcanos southwest side, suggesting the eruption caused a section to break loose, Karnawati said.
The volcanic island formed after the 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano, a disaster that killed more than 30,000 people. Most of the island sank into a volcanic crater under the sea, and the area remained calm until the 1920s, when Anak Krakatau began to rise from the site. It continues to grow each year and erupts periodically.

But even in a disaster-prone country where mass casualties are commonly reported, survivors of Saturdays tsunami said it seemed extra menacing because everything seemed perfect until the second it hit.
That night was a nightmare, said Setiadi, the stage crew member who climbed down from the tree after the water receded. He ran home in the darkness, tripping and falling several times over bodies in the street.

Natasha Lomas,"Reports of the death of Bitcoin in India have been greatly exaggerated. On Thursday a budget speech by finance Minister Arun Jaitley generated a tsunami of ‘the Bitcoin party is over in India’ headlines, adding to downward pressures on the cryptocurrency. Safe to say, the truth of the matter is a lot more gray. Yes, Jaitley talked tough on crypto currencies. But no, there was no outright ban — not yet, anyway. The Indian government’s plans for crypto regulation remain unformulated (or at least unstated). Here’s the relevant chunk of Jaitley’s speech (via The India Express ): Distributed ledger system or the block chain technology allows organization of any chain of records or transactions without the need of intermediaries. The Government does not consider crypto-currencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system. The Government will explore use of block chain technology proactively for ushering in digital economy. One clear takeaway from that is the minister is sounding much more positive about blockchain technology. And his tonal contrast between blockchain and cryptocurrencies is obviously intentional — and therefore interesting. So yes Jaitley wants to sound like he’s pouring cold water on crypto. But whether that means you should hodl or not depends on your own personal threshold for risk. The point about the Indian government not recognizing crypto as legal tender was already made by Jaitley, back in December. And a crackdown on crypto financing illegitimate activities is what any government will say it wants to do. What’s more interesting is the second clause in his sentence — where he tacks on “or as part of the payment system”, which is certainly suggestive of a ban. But nothing is explicitly stated. And, as CNN reported earlier, Jaitley was explicitly asked if the government is moving to ban cryptocurrencies by Indian state-owned broadcaster Doordarshan, which interviewed him after the budget speech. Here’s CNN’s translation of the exchange (emphasis mine): TV Host: We’ve seen a lot of excitement over bitcoins. Why aren’t you banning it instead of stating it isn’t legal tender? Jaitley: We are discouraging people from using it now. There is a government committee that’s looking into it right now and they will announce their decisions and next steps after they are done. So really the minister’s intention looks to have been to try and inject a little more sanity into the crypto space by splashing a little cold water around. And no one should argue with the sense of that. But how exactly will Bitcoin and crypto be regulated in India? Well, that remains to be seen.

Patrick Allan,"Anybody can spew out some half-assed apology to save face, but a real apology takes serious introspection, sincerity, and focuses on helping the victim heal. It’s not easy to do, but this simple interactive tool can help if you’re struggling. “It’s good that you’re here,” the first screen reads when you load it up. It is good. Man, this last couple of weeks has seen a veritable tsunami of sexual-harassment allegations,… Read more Read The tool, called Am I Part of the Problem?, comes from game designer and activist Elizabeth Sampat. It’s a step-by-step self-examination tool she built using the Twine open-source storytelling platform which allows those who need to apologize a way to better understand the intent of their actions, how they harmed others, and what they can do to make amends in a way that benefits the victim. It gives you an opportunity to be honest without being judged and learn how you can not only apologize better, but how you can grow as a person. For example, you’ll be asked right off the bat if you meant to hurt someone with your actions. If you say yes, you’ll be shown a list of reasons why, like “I was angry,” “I was jealous,” or “I was insecure.” Then you see a message like this: At that point, if you say that you’re worried that you’re a bad person, the tool keeps you focused on what matters in a good apology by saying: Here’s the thing: the question of whether this makes you a bad person is irrelevant. I know it doesn’t feel that way. But the problem with asking the question “Does this action make me a bad person?” makes the situation about you, and not about the person you harmed... I can’t tell you if you are a bad person. I can only tell you that focusing on the person you hurt is an important part of being a good person. As you go on, the tool walks you through the process of writing an effective, well-meaning apology, and tries to see if amends can or should be made for what you did. In some cases, the tool will even warn you to hold off on an apology for now, as it might interrupt the victim’s healing process. There are several types of scenario built into the tool, and they all end with additional resources for transgressors to consider. Sampat explained to The Verge : “I know that it can be really overwhelming to realize that something in your life needs to change, and not know where to start. I wanted to make sure that people using this tool at least had a place to begin.” That said, Sampat also admits she’s no expert. Am I Part of the Problem? draws from a wide variety of real psychology and professional resources, including the 12-step program found in most recover programs, but it’s only a starting point. Still, if you’ve hurt somebody recently or in the past, give this tool a try. It will help you apologize for what you did the right way, but it might also open your eyes to a larger problem you can work on. Check it out at the link below.

Photo An advertisement for a new baseball team on the side of a vending machine. Credit Seth Berkman for The New York Times “We are looked at like Chernobyl,” said Saito Nobuyuki, who was born in Fukushima and now owns Sportsland, a sporting goods store here. “It’s difficult to change.” Akinori Iwamura is among those hoping to rehabilitate Fukushima’s name. Iwamura was the starting second baseman for the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2008 World Series. He also won two World Baseball Classic championships with Japan and played in the Nippon Professional Baseball League for 13 years. Today, Iwamura, 38, is toiling at the lowest levels of organized baseball. He is the manager of the Fukushima Hopes, a semipro team whose games are sparsely attended; Iwamura equated the level of play to Class AA baseball in the United States. “I call myself a missionary,” Iwamura said. “Even though it’s a negative way many people know the name of Fukushima, we have to change it into a positive way.” Iwamura was preparing to play for the Rakuten Golden Eagles when the earthquake and tsunami struck. Although he is from Ehime Prefecture in southern Japan, Iwamura said he felt it became his “destiny” to help rebuild Fukushima after he retired. Among those who encouraged him, Iwamura said, was Chicago Cubs Manager Joe Maddon, who was his coach with the Rays. Iwamura could have a big stage to help bolster the area’s image when Fukushima Azuma Baseball Stadium, the home park of the Hopes, hosts Olympic games in 2020. Iwamura sees in that another opportunity to inform the world about life beyond the disaster. Photo The Fukushima Azuma Baseball Stadium in November.

The stadium is in the capital, about 90 minutes from Tokyo by high-speed train and 55 miles west of the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The city did not receive extensive damage like other towns closer to the plant and the coast, which concerns critics who believe the conditions of more seriously affected areas will be ignored because of the Olympics. Immediately after the announcement in March that Fukushima would host baseball, antinuclear activists denounced the move. They argued it created a facade that Fukushima had returned to normal and glossed over the remaining hardships faced by an estimated 120,000 residents who still cannot — and may never — return to their homes. “The Japanese government wants to show the fake side of Fukushima,” said Hajime Matsukubo, secretary general for the Citizens’ Nuclear Information Center in Tokyo. In his office, Matsukubo showed a copy of the Fukushima Minpo newspaper, which listed radiation levels of all the towns in Fukushima like box scores in a daily sports section. Azby Brown, who works for Safecast, an organization that helps citizens independently measure environmental data like radiation levels, said Olympic visitors staying near the stadium for a week probably would not be exposed to higher than normal radiation. But he also disagreed with the government’s messaging about Fukushima. “Communities have been destroyed, there has been no real accountability, the environmental contamination will persist for decades and will require vigilance and conscientious monitoring the entire time,” Brown wrote in an email. “People who accept the radiation measurements and make a rational decision to return still live with a nagging concern and doubt, as if they’re living in a haunted house.” Photo The No. 3 nuclear reactor of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that caused meltdowns and radiation leaks at the plant forever changed the area. Credit Digital Globe, via Reuters When Japan was awarded the 2020 Olympics in September 2013, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe assured the I.O.C. that “ the situation is under control ” in Fukushima. Four years later, Brown said, public infrastructure projects in destroyed areas have been delayed because construction companies became too focused on gaining Olympic-related work around Tokyo. Prefectural Gov. Masao Uchibori contended that the area was showing notable progress in reconstruction. Uchibori cited the continual reopening of tourist sites in the area and the growing influence of sports on civic pride. He added that the rebuilding of contaminated areas and a declining population cannot be overlooked, calling these contrasting aspects the “light and shadow” of Fukushima. “At this moment, I cannot find any negative point,” to holding Olympics events in Fukushima, Uchibori said, “but I would like to work in cooperation with the organizing committee and the central government in order to make people think it was good to hold the events in Fukushima.” Uchibori added that “rumors” of Fukushima’s condition contribute to the shadow over the prefecture.

Credit Tomohiro Ohsumi for The New York Times Large swaths of Fukushima remain uninhabitable, with cleanup at the plant estimated to take up to 40 years and cost almost $200 billion. Still, some residents see hope in the Olympics. “If the Olympics doesn’t happen in Fukushima now, the image of Fukushima doesn’t change for a long time,” said Aya Watanabe, a student at Fukushima University who interned in Houston during the summer and saw the impact the Astros’ World Series victory had on morale in the hurricane-stricken city. “It’s a very big chance for Fukushima to change the prospects.” While teams like the Hopes and Firebonds are still relatively new, their players have already seen how sports can be helpful in Fukushima’s recovery. Deon Jones, who played college basketball at Monmouth University, is in his first year with the Firebonds. His mother initially worried about him living in Fukushima, but he has enjoyed playing here, learning about the backgrounds and hardships of local teammates like the point guard Igari and Shota Kanno, who is from the nearby city of Nihonmatsu. Several times a week, players hold clinics at local schools. A team spokeswoman said Firebonds home games draw about 2,000 fans. “You’re playing for a little bit more than basketball,” Jones said. “You’re playing for everyone in Fukushima.” And then there’s baseball, Japan’s national pastime. After Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Olympics, a strong push was made to reintroduce baseball specifically for these Games because of its history and popularity among youth in Japan. Participation has fallen in Fukushima since the 2011 tsunami. Atsushi Kobari, director of the Fukushima High School Baseball Federation, has tracked the declining enrollment of high school players over the last six years.

But a majority of the 21,434 former residents asked for their homes to be demolished instead.

Miwako Kurikama, whose son Ryota plays baseball for Fukushima Commercial High School, was evacuated after the tsunami. Ryota’s elementary school permanently closed. At times, Kurikama drove 90 minutes away just to find fields where her son could practice. On a recent Sunday morning, Kurikama watched him in a scrimmage with his high school teammates at Shinobugaoka Baseball Stadium in Fukushima. She was joined by six other mothers sitting behind home plate. They shared snacks and kept score on a chalkboard, laughing and cheering in unison during rundowns or run-scoring hits. Kurikama has known some of the players since first grade, before her son’s school closed. Having them all together again seemed cathartic, familial. Nearby at the baseball stadium, Little Leaguers from Fukushima were playing on the same field in Azuma Park that Olympians will patrol in two and half years. At Matsukawaundo Koen Ya Baseball Field, a children’s tournament was invigorated by a soundtrack of banging plastic megaphones, resembling a Japanese professional game. As normal as these scenes may have felt for some residents, the specter from the 2011 disaster remained. In a fenced-off area in Azuma Park, hundreds of giant black trash bags filled with decontaminated waste were being stored, stacked above eye-level and still not yet properly discarded. The city government is working with Japan’s ministry of the environment to remove them before the Olympics, but for now the area, which was big enough to hold another baseball field, instead resembled a junkyard. At the baseball fields around the city, as children ran down the first base line or chased down fly balls in right field, they passed by ominous signs posting the day’s radiation levels — tallies with more serious implications than the runs on the scoreboard. Although sports are helping some in Fukushima heal, they have not erased all doubts about the future — and perhaps they shouldn’t be expected to. “The government needs to inform us of actual information with scientific proof,” said Michiaki Kakudate, who was watching his son, Keigo, 11, pitch at the children’s tournament. “They say it’s no problem, but that doesn’t convince people.” Continue reading the main story",Children played baseball at Matsukawaundo Koen Ya Baseball Field in Fukushima in November.

Rachel Becker,"The worst disaster in California’s history wasn’t an earthquake, or a fire, or a drought — it was a flood that killed thousands, wiped out mines and ranches, and submerged the state capital, Sacramento. For 43 days, starting in December 1861, California was inundated. Today, hardly anyone thinks about the floodwaters that turned California’s Central Valley into a vast lake — but it will happen again. “It’s not a question of if, but when,” writes seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones in her new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters H ave Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them). That’s why it’s key for us to know about the disasters in our history, so that we’re not doomed to repeat them on what will certainly be a much larger scale. After all, more than 100 times as many people now live in California as did during that deluge, Jones writes. “What’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities.” While natural hazards are inevitable, the destruction they wreak is not, Jones says in an interview with The Verge. “We can make choices about how we handle that — but we have to think ahead,” she says. Working at the US Geological Survey, Jones led a team of scientists who investigated the potential catastrophes in California’s future. One of them was a flood, and the team discovered that our existing flood control strategies would be no match for a deluge nearly the size of the one that started in 1861: The disaster would cause more devastation than an earthquake on the infamous San Andreas fault. After 33 years at the USGS, Jones retired and opened the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, which aims to boost community resilience using science. In her book, she lays out catastrophic disasters in human history from the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii to Hurricane Katrina to the Tohoku quake in Japan in 2011. She tells both the scientific story of how disasters unfolded, and the human story of the communities they struck. “We have to think ahead.” Her goal is to teach readers about disasters by drawing them in with narratives, and to address the ways human nature can make it harder to prepare for the future. Most of us assume a big disaster is going to be similar to smaller ones we’ve experienced, which can make us overconfident in our ability to deal with catastrophes — something experts call “normalization bias.” Our tendency to focus on more immediate threats can also come at the expense of preparing for more distant ones — which makes sense, Jones says: “If you worry about the 100-year flood and not about the wolf that’s about to eat your children, your DNA does not get passed down.” She draws on her experience as a scientist, and as a communicator who helped the public make sense of the destruction in the aftermath of earthquakes. The Verge spoke with Jones about natural hazards, risk assessment, and the disaster that haunts her. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. I grew up in California, and only learned about the 1861-1862 flood last year. How do you keep the memory of such a major disaster fresh, and make sure that people don’t forget that this could happen again? Photo by Helen Berger Dr. Lucy Jones It’s very difficult to do. In a natural world, if we hadn’t built all of our flood control systems, we would have smaller floods much more often. When you have the smaller ones, at least you know that flooding is a risk. But you do tend to believe that the risk is what you’ve already dealt with. So, paradoxically, the flood managers who were fully aware of the 1861 flood seemed more willing to say, ‘We’ve got it covered. That isn’t really going to happen again.” And, like with earthquakes, I find that the people were actually part of a response to Northridge, [ a quake that hit part of the Los Angeles area in 1994 ], are much more overconfident about their abilities to handle the really big one, because they feel like they dealt with the really big one. And that that wasn’t the really big one doesn’t get through. Hundreds of years ago, we didn’t have the information to be able to think ahead. Now we have more information, and yet we still struggle with the emotional aspect of it, because it doesn’t seem real to us. And that, right there, is the challenge of natural disasters. We know what they’re going to do, we know how to build to avoid the damage, but everything about human nature keeps us from looking forward [for] that really long-term planning. So it requires much more rational, logical thought, and reasoned discourse. So how do we now wrestle with the human inability to think ahead and also to remember the past? “Around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before.” Because of globalization and improved telecommunications, we now have a situation where a flood or a big disaster somewhere else in the world is something we can experience in real time. One of the most striking examples of that was the Tohoku earthquake in northern Japan [in 2011]. I’m sitting in my living room in California, and I can turn on the TV and watch in real time the tsunami wave. And we see the people fleeing from it, from the air. We don’t have enough to save them at this point, but we watch them in real time suffer through this. Now, around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before, I would say. Fifteen years ago, it was rare to find a person who knew what a tsunami was. But between the Indian Ocean event [in 2004], and Japan [in 2011], and the really direct, emotional experience with the power of telecommunications, we have a really different understanding and experience of it. And that is allowing us to overcome that normalization bias, and it’s part of the reason that we’ve been able to [make progress] here in Southern California [with] getting people to take the risk seriously and doing something about it. For us, it isn’t about tsunamis, it’s mostly about earthquakes. The book is divided by chapter into case studies of different disasters through history — which one kept you up at night? Which one haunted you? The 1927 Mississippi flood — the greatest flood disaster in American history. Mississippi is a huge river system that drains the majority of American states. A huge rainfall starting in the fall of 1926 through winter and spring led to failures of the levees protecting the land around the Mississippi river. And 27,000 square miles were flooded and over 1 million people were flooded out of their homes. Over 600,000 people were living in refugee camps. “What really haunted me... was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens.” But what really haunted me about it — and made it by far the most difficult chapter to research and write — was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens. What happened to African American victims of the flood was appalling, and just the inhumanity of how they were treated. The Kanto earthquake, which was only four years before that was also — in Japan — an equally horrible turning on neighbors. And it was recognizing that part of the human experience is the need to find a reason why it was the victim’s fault, to blame the victim: “Because if it was the victim’s fault, then I can protect myself by not making those same mistakes.” It’s a subconscious response to fear: “I don’t want that to be able to happen to me.” So you find reasons that it’s the victim’s fault. And at the worst level, you then punish the victim of the situation. So when you ask what haunted me, I’m an Earth scientist. So the physical part of it was all what I understood and expected going in. What haunted me, and inspired, was sometimes the horribleness of human response, and sometimes the real inspiration of human response. And you see both in those stories. The book talks about the disconnect between the language scientists use and the language the public use s to talk about disasters. Scientists have their wind speeds for hurricanes, magnitude for earthquake, probability for flood — then the public asks, “Was it The Big One?” How do we bridge that gap — and do we need to? “I just see people talking past each other so much.” The stuff I put in this book — none of it is really hard to understand. A high schooler could easily read the book and understand it, maybe even somebody younger. And yet we don’t teach it. And therefore, the public doesn’t have a context within which to be getting the information or having the discussion. So we need better education in science, which does not mean learning a bunch of facts — the other part is to understand how to think about science, the fundamentals of science as a process for learning what’s really true. We don’t teach that. But then we also need to help the scientists understand that people are looking for a mix: they want the science, but they also want the human side of it. And we need to help the scientists do a better job of being to answer the human questions. I just see people talking past each other so much. You write about how being a seismologist gives you an unusual perspective on time and that a forecast that a disaster will happen “‘sometime in the next millennium’ sounds not like an evasion, but like a threat.” How has this perspective shaped your own relationship with risk? Are you resigned to it, or have you bought every kind of disaster insurance there is? “The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but chances of it in my lifetime?” The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but the chances of it in my lifetime? Well, the San Andreas is probably going to have [an earthquake] in my lifetime, but the fault I live near probably isn’t. So yes, it’s a possibility, but I just have to keep it balanced because it’s a relatively low possibility compared to other things. People assume that where I live must be a place that’s really safe from earthquakes, but we moved to a community with really good schools sitting right on top of a significant fault. We were basically gambling that an earthquake wouldn’t happen before the kids got out of high school, and it worked. Climate change is going to make meteorological disasters more frequent and more devastating, right? What do we need to do to make sure that we’re prepared? It’s going to be very difficult. People do not sufficiently understand what we are doing to ourselves with this. We need to do everything we can to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere and reduce what’s already there if it’s at all possible. Because more heat in the atmosphere doesn’t just mean it’s warmer and ‘oh I guess I can handle that.’ That means more energy to drive storms, and they are going to be getting worse. “That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger.” So first off, we’ve got to admit it. We can’t talk about nuisance flooding, because high tide is bringing it into your house, without thinking about what that means when the hurricane comes through. One of the big issues in America is that we have a pretty strong tradition of individual land rights: nobody gets to tell you what to do with your own land. We are really struggling as a society to be able to make those big scale decisions. We need to be changing our attitudes about community, how much we share, to accept that we’re dependent on the decisions of others. We don’t like to do that as Americans either, we so prize our independence. So we philosophically oppose that, but that doesn’t change what’s going to happen. That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger. If there were one thing you wanted your reader to take home about this book, what is it? You have choices. That hazards are inevitable and the disaster is not. We as a society have choices, both what we do individually, but also a choice to work together. The thing that came out of it for me is that what’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities, and we can change that if we can work together as a community.","In the new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them),  seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones tells both the scientific story of disasters, and the human story of the communities they struck.",2018-05-26T13:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",The hardest part of preparing for disasters is overcoming human nature,https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/26/17321100/the-big-ones-natural-disasters-lucy-jones-earthquakes-hurricanes-volcanoes-floods,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoH9Pj5-jHrX7PK8KOR706Ssf7I=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10780201/mdoying_180504_2512_0002.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,tsunami,1
Fergus Jensen,"CIGONDONG/JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - As Indonesia reels from the carnage of yet another natural disaster, authorities around the globe are working on how they can prepare for the kind of freak tsunami that battered coasts west of Jakarta this month. 
The Dec. 23 tsunami killed around 430 people along the coastlines of the Sunda Strait, capping a year of earthquakes and tsunamis in the vast archipelago, which straddles the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire. 
No sirens were heard in those towns and beaches to alert people before the deadly series of waves hit shore. 
Seismologists and authorities say a perfect storm of factors caused the tsunami and made early detection near impossible given the equipment in place. 
But the disaster should be a wake-up call to step up research on tsunami triggers and preparedness, said several of the experts, some of whom have traveled to the Southeast Asian nation to investigate what happened. 
“Indonesia has demonstrated to the rest of the world the huge variety of sources that have the potential to cause tsunamis. More research is needed to understand those less-expected events,” said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton. 
Most tsunamis on record have been triggered by earthquakes. But this time it was an eruption of Anak Krakatau volcano that caused its crater to partially collapse into the sea at high tide, sending waves up to 5 metres (16 feet) high smashing into densely populated coastal areas on Java and Sumatra islands. 
During the eruption, an estimated 180 million cubic metres, or around two-thirds of the less-than-100-year-old volcanic island, collapsed into the sea. 
But the eruption didn’t rattle seismic monitors significantly, and the absence of seismic signals normally associated with tsunamis led Indonesia’s geophysics agency (BMKG) initially to tweet there was no tsunami. 
Muhamad Sadly, head of geophysics at BMKG, later told Reuters its tidal monitors were not set up to trigger tsunami warnings from non-seismic events. 
The head of Japan’s International Research Institute of Disaster, Fumihiko Imamura, told Reuters he did not believe Japan’s current warning system would have detected a tsunami like the one in the Sunda Strait. 
“We still have some risks of this in Japan...because there’s 111 active volcanoes and low capacity to monitor eruptions generating a tsunami,” he said in Jakarta. 
Scientists have long flagged the collapse of Anak Krakatau, around 155 km (100 miles) west of the capital, as a concern. A 2012 study published by the Geological Society of London deemed it a “tsunami hazard.” 
Anak Krakatau has emerged from the Krakatoa volcano, which in 1883 erupted in one of the biggest explosions in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunamis and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash. 
BROKEN WARNING SYSTEM 
Some experts believe there was enough time for at least a partial detection of last week’s tsunami in the 24 minutes it took waves to hit land after the landslide on Anak Krakatau. 
But a country-wide tsunami warning system of buoys connected to seabed sensors has been out of order since 2012 due to vandalism, neglect and a lack of public funds, authorities say. 
“The lack of an early warning system is why Saturday’s tsunami was not detected,” said disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho, adding that of 1,000 tsunami sirens needed across Indonesia, only 56 are in place. 
“Signs that a tsunami was coming weren’t detected and so people did not have time to evacuate.” 
President Joko Widodo this week ordered BMKG to purchase new early warning systems, and the agency later said it planned to install three tsunami buoys on the islands surrounding Anak Krakatau. 
The cost of covering the country is estimated at 7 trillion rupiah ($481.10 million). That is roughly equivalent to Indonesia’s total disaster response budget of 7.19 trillion rupiah for 2018, according to Nugroho. 
But other experts say even if this network had been working, averting disaster would have been difficult. 
“The tsunami was very much a worst-case scenario for any hope of a clear tsunami warning: a lack of an obvious earthquake to trigger a warning, shallow water, rough seabed, and the close proximity to nearby coastlines,” said seismologist Hicks. 
In the Philippines, Renato Solidum, undersecretary for disaster risk reduction, said eruptions from the country’s Taal volcano had caused tsunami waves before in the surrounding Taal Lake. 
He told Reuters that what happened in Indonesia showed the need to “re-emphasize awareness and preparedness” regarding volcanic activity and its potential to trigger tsunamis in the Philippines. 
The United States has also suffered several tsunamis caused by volcanic activity, including in Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington, according to the national weather service. 
MORE EDUCATION 
In Indonesia earlier this year, a double quake-and-tsunami disaster killed over 2,000 people on Sulawesi island, while at least 500 died when an earthquake flattened much of the northern coastline of the holiday island of Lombok. 
In a country where, according to government data, 62.4 percent of the population is at risk of being struck by earthquakes and 1.6 percent by tsunamis, attention is now focused on a continued lack of preparedness. 
“Given the potential for disasters in the country, it’s time to have disaster education be part of the national curriculum,” Widodo told reporters after the latest tsunami. 
For Ramdi Tualfredi, a high school teacher who survived last week’s waves, these improvements cannot come soon enough. 
He told Reuters that people in his village of Cigondong on the west coast of Java and close to Krakatau had never received any safety drills or evacuation training. 
“I’ve never received education on safety steps,” he said. 
“The system...totally failed.”

"Harry Pearl, Agence France-Presse","CARITA, Indonesia - Desperately needed aid flowed into a stretch of Indonesia's tsunami-struck coastline Tuesday, but humanitarian workers warned that clean water and medicine supplies were dwindling as thousands crammed makeshift evacuation centers.
Fears about a public health crisis come as the death toll from Saturday's volcano-triggered disaster rose to nearly 400 with thousands more displaced from flattened homes.
""A lot of the children are sick with fevers, headaches and they haven't had enough water,"" said Rizal Alimin, a doctor working for NGO Aksi Cepat Tanggap, at a local school that was turned into a temporary shelter.
""We have less medicine than usual...It's not healthy here for evacuees. There isn't enough clean water. They need food and people are sleeping on the floor.""
The powerful tsunami struck at night and without warning, sweeping over popular beaches on southern Sumatra and western Java and inundated tourist hotels and coastal settlements.
The latest death toll stood at 373, with 1,459 people injured and another 128 missing.
Experts have warned that more deadly waves could slam the stricken region.
Many of the more than 5,000 evacuees are too afraid to return home, fearing another disaster.
""I've been here three days,"" said Neng Sumarni, 40, who was sleeping with her three children and husband on the school's floor with some three dozen others.
""I'm scared because my home is right near the beach.""
'CAN'T REACH THEM'
Abu Salim, with volunteer group Tagana, said aid workers were scrambling to stabilize the situation.
""Today we're focusing on helping the evacuees in shelters by setting up public kitchens and distributing logistics and more tents in suitable places,"" he told AFP on Tuesday.
""(People) still don't have access to running water...There are many evacuees who fled to higher ground and we still can't reach them.""
Aid was flowing in mainly by road while two government boats were on their way to several islands near the Sumatran coast to help dozens of marooned residents.
Officials have said the evidence suggested that an eruption at the rumbling Anak Krakatoa volcano in the Sunda Strait -- between Java and Sumatra -- caused a section of the crater to collapse and slide into the ocean, triggering the tsunami.
Unlike those caused by earthquakes, which usually trigger alert systems, volcano-triggered tsunamis give authorities very little time to warn residents of the impending threat.
Indonesia's disaster agency initially said there was no tsunami threat at all, even as the killer wave crashed ashore.
It was later forced to issue a correction and an apology as it pointed to a lack of early warning systems for the high death toll.
Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said on Monday: ""The lack of a tsunami early warning system caused a lot of victims because people did not have the time to evacuate.""
Meanwhile, rescue teams were using their bare hands, diggers and other heavy equipment to haul debris from the stricken area and hunt for corpses, as hopes of finding more survivors dwindle.
The tsunami was Indonesia's third major natural disaster in six months, following a series of powerful earthquakes on the island of Lombok in July and August and a quake-tsunami in September that killed around 2,200 people in Palu on Sulawesi island, with thousands more missing and presumed dead.
It also came less than a week before the 14th anniversary of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the deadliest disasters in history that killed some 220,000 people in countries around the Indian Ocean, including some 168,000 Indonesians.
The vast archipelago nation is one of the most disaster-hit nations on Earth due to its position straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates collide.

Reuters Editorial,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - A tsunami killed at least 62 people on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra and injured hundreds following an underwater landslide caused by a volcanic eruption on Saturday, the disaster mitigation agency said. 
Indonesia sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years: 
- 2004: A massive 9.1 magnitude quake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh. 
- 2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April. Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra. 
- 2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people. 
- 2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province. More than 1,100 people were killed. 
- 2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people. 
- 2016: A shallow quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded by the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami. No tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 were killed by fallen buildings. 
- 2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island. 
- 2018: More than 2,000 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, on the west coast of Sulawesi island.","A tsunami killed at least 62 people on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra and injured hundreds following an underwater landslide caused by a volcanic eruption on Saturday, the disaster mitigation agency said.",2018-12-25T04:45:59Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Factbox: Indonesia regularly hit by quakes and tsunamis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-tsunami-factbox-idUSKCN1OO06D,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20181225&t=2&i=1338773568&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEEBO04J,reuters,Reuters,tsunami,1
Niniek Karmini,"Brightly colored body bags were placed side-by-side in a freshly dug mass grave Monday, as a hard-hit Indonesian city began burying its dead from the devastating earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 840 people and left thousands homeless. The death toll, largely from the city of Palu, is expected to keep rising as areas cut off by the damage are reached. The magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck at dusk Friday and generated a tsunami said to have been as high as 20 feet in places. Local army commander Tiopan Aritonang said 545 bodies would be brought to the grave from one hospital alone. The trench dug in Palu was 33 feet by 330 feet and can be enlarged if needed, said Willem Rampangilei, chief of Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency. ""This must be done as soon as possible for health and religious reasons,"" he said. Indonesia is majority Muslim, and religious custom calls for burials soon after death, typically within one day. Local military spokesman Mohammad Thorir said the area adjacent to a public cemetery can hold 1,000 bodies. All of the victims, coming from local hospitals, have been photographed to help families locate where their relatives were buried. Video footage showed residents walking from body bag to body bag, opening the tops to check if they could identify faces. Around midday, teams of workers, their mouths covered by masks, carried 18 bodies and laid them in the trench. A backhoe waited to push soil on top of the dead. More burials were expected to follow. Military and commercial aircraft were delivering some aid and supplies. But there was a need for heavy equipment to reach possible survivors buried in collapsed buildings, including an eight-story hotel in Palu where voices had been heard in the rubble. People suffering from a lack of food and supplies were also becoming more desperate. Local television said around 3,000 residents had flocked to the Palu airport trying to get out. Footage showed some people screaming in anger because they were not able to board departing military aircraft. The airport has resumed only some commercial flights. ""We have not eaten for three days!"" one woman yelled. ""We just want to be safe!"" Indonesian President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo authorized the acceptance of international help, said disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, adding that generators, heavy equipment and tents were among the items needed. He said the European Union and 10 countries have offered assistance, including the United States, Australia and China. ""We will send food today, as much as possible with several aircraft,"" Widodo told reporters in the capital, Jakarta, adding that a supply of fuel was also set to arrive. Nugroho said conditions in the Balaroa section of Palu were particularly bad because the earthquake caused the ground to violently heave up and sink down in places, trapping many people under destroyed houses. In Petobo, another area of the city, the temblor caused loose, wet soil to liquefy, creating a thick, heavy mud that caused massive damage. ""In Petobo, it is estimated that there are still hundreds of victims buried in mud material,"" Nugroho said. Villagers who pulled out loved ones alive and dead over the weekend expressed frustration that it took rescue teams until Monday to reach Petobo. Edi Setiawan, 32, said he and fellow villagers were able to rescue five children and four adults, including a pregnant woman. However, his sister and father were not among them. ""My sister was found embracing her father,"" he said. ""My mother was able to survive after struggling against the mud and being rescued by villagers."" Another villager, 52-year-old Idrus, who uses one name, said that ""up to Saturday we still saw many people screaming for help from the roofs. But we could not do anything to help them. Now their cries are no longer heard."" But there were cases of survivors still being pulled from the rubble in different locations, including a 25-year-old woman found alive Sunday evening in the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, according to the National Search and Rescue Agency, which released photos of her lying on a stretcher covered with a blanket. Novry Wullur, an officer from Indonesia's search and rescue agency, said Nurul Istiharah, 15, managed to survive after being trapped inside her house after it collapsed. Her mother and niece were dead beside her, and water had left her submerged up to her neck and in danger of drowning. Her legs were finally freed and she was pulled out of the rubble. She was being treated for hypothermia at a hospital. The confirmed death toll of 844 released by Nugroho on Monday afternoon was an increase of only 12 since the previous day, with nearly the entire total from Palu. The regencies of Donggala, Sigi and Parigi Moutong with a combined population of 1.2 million had yet to be fully assessed. Nearly 50,000 people have been displaced from their homes in Palu alone, Nugroho said. He said 114 foreigners were in Palu and Donggala during the disaster. All were accounted for except one Belgian, one South Korean and six French. It was the latest natural disaster to hit Indonesia, which is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island in western Indonesia triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries. More recently, a powerful quake on the island of Lombok killed 505 people in August. In Donggala, the site closest to the earthquake's epicenter, aerial footage on Metro TV showed the sugary blond sands of beaches swept out to sea, along with some buildings. Some buildings in the town were severely damaged, with plywood walls shredded and chunks of concrete scattered on the pavement. Much of the damage, however, appeared limited to the waterfront. Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was strewn with debris from the earthquake and tsunami. A heavily damaged mosque was half submerged and a shopping mall was reduced to a crumpled hulk. A large bridge with yellow arches collapsed. The city is built around a narrow bay that apparently magnified the force of the tsunami as the waves raced into the tight inlet. Nugroho said water was reported as high as 20 feet in some places. In one devastated area in Palu, residents said dozens of people could still be buried in their homes. ""The ground rose up like a spine and suddenly fell. Many people were trapped and buried under collapsed houses. I could do nothing to help,"" resident Nur Indah said, crying. ""In the evening, some of them turned on their cellphones just to give a sign that they were there. But the lights were off later and the next day."" With hundreds injured, earthquake-damaged hospitals were overwhelmed. Indonesia is a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands home to 260 million people. Roads and infrastructure are poor in many areas, making access difficult in the best of conditions.

Asia Times staff,"The extent of the death and destruction wrought by a twin earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi will become more clear on Tuesday as authorities and rescue workers reach affected areas that until now have been inaccessible due to broken infrastructure. Authorities provisionally put the death toll at 844 on Tuesday, a figure based largely on destruction in the capital of Palu. Reports indicate that figure will likely rise dramatically as rescuers reach outlying areas of the islands, including communities that were closer to Friday’s 7.5 magnitude earthquake’s epicenter. Authorities have said they fear whole communities may have been swept away by a tsunami which dramatic video footage taken by residents showed crashing into coastal areas of the capital, Palu. The killer wave has devastated infrastructure, leaving affected areas without electricity and fuel. As of Tuesday, nearly 60,000 people have been displaced and are in need of emergency help, while thousands have been streaming out of stricken areas, Reuters reported. Also on Tuesday, some of the dead were taken to a mass grave for burial. Grieve for the people of Central Sulawesi, we all grieve together, President Joko Widodo said on Twitter late on Sunday. Vice President Jusuf Kalla had said earlier that the death toll could rise into the “thousands.” Rescuers are expected today to reach Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts, which have been cut off from communications since Friday, agencies reported. The districts have a combined population of 1.4 million, the reports said. The situation in the affected [Donggala] areas is nightmarish, Jan Gelfand, head of an International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies office in Jakarta, said in a statement. The city of Palu has been devastated and first reports out of Donggala indicate that it has also been hit extremely hard. While rescuers endeavor to locate and provide assistance to survivors, Widodos government is scrambling to show a competent and prompt response amid rising questions about its failure to warn residents of the incoming tsunami. News agencies reported that dozens of people were trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in Palu. On Monday, Widodo told reporters rescuing those trapped people was a priority. The evacuation is not finished yet, there are many places where the evacuation couldnt be done because of the absence of heavy equipment, but last night equipment started to arrive, Widodo said to reporters. He said the government was sending “as much food supplies as possible” by military transport aircraft from the national capital. On Tuesday, a navy vessel capable of taking 1,000 people at a time was due to be deployed to help with the evacuation. State-owned oil and gas company Pertamina started distributing diesel fuel to crucial facilities like hospitals and electricity company PLN, as well as for search and rescue operations in Palu and Donggala, the Jakarta Post reported. But hard questions are rising in particular over why the meteorological and geophysics agency, known as BMKG, issued a tsunami warning soon after the quake hit, but lifted it 34 minutes later. Officials have claimed that the tsunami warning was still in place when the killer wave hit coastal areas. Videos of the wave as it hit Palu taken by residents in high rise buildings showed people on the beach and beachside roads apparently unaware as the massive water surge approached. Those images harked to the December 26, 2004 tsunami caused by an earthquake off the coast of Sumatra that killed 120,000 people in Indonesia, largely in the northern Aceh province. The lack of early warning systems contributed to the high death toll in that disaster. Other critical questions surround why warning systems established in the wake of that disaster appear to have failed to warn citizens on Friday. NDMAs Nugroho told reporters that none of the tsunami buoys used to detect the waves had been operational since 2012 due to a lack of funding. Widodos government is bidding to appear more responsive in the disasters aftermath, so far with mixed results. On Sunday, the president visited a housing complex smashed by the quake while calling on survivors for “patience” as assistance started to trickle into affected areas that were still being rattled by aftershocks. I know there are many problems that need to be solved in a short time, including communications, he said. He assured residents that the ruins would be rebuilt, according to reports. The Jakarta Post said in a commentary that while disaster-related authorities say public awareness campaigns on natural disasters have continued for years, including in Central Sulawesi, it was evident in how easily buildings collapsed that leaders and city planners had not implemented earthquake-resistant building codes and standards. At the same time, there are risks that the disasters aftermath could tilt towards anomie amid rising reports, including videos posted to social media, of widespread looting. Television images showed scores of residents shouting were hungry, we need food as soldiers distributed rations from a truck in one neighborhood, while footage from elsewhere showed people making off with clothes and other items from a wrecked mall, Reuters reported. Internal Affairs Minister Tjahjo Kumolo said he had ordered authorities to help people get food and drink and businesses that suffered from looting would be compensated. The apparent official condoning of looting is raising hackles with local retailers who claim that at least 40 damaged outlets have been affected. We are concerned about the government’s arrogance in allowing people to loot goods from retail outlets in Palu and Donggala, without [first] coordinating with their owners or management, or with the association, said Roy Nicholas Mandey, chairman of the Indonesian Retailers Association, according to local reports. Local residents had also stolen fuel from the trucks of state-owned oil and gas giant Pertamina, according to reports. Tjahjo has since denied he made any statement condoning looting as a means to distribute goods to affected populations. On Monday, a witness quoted by Reuters said queues at petrol stations on the approaches to Palu stretched for kilometers. Convoys carrying food, water and fuel awaited police escorts to prevent pilfering before heading towards the city while a stream of residents headed out. One aid worker quoted anonymously by Reuters spoke of growing lawlessness and threats of violence among survivors seeking fuel. The state energy company, Pertamina, said it was airlifting in 4,000 liters of fuel, while Indonesias logistics agency said it would send hundreds of tons of rice. On Monday, Widodo authorized the country to accept international assistance to deal with the aftermath, according to a tweet by Indonesia’s Investment Coordinating Board. It was not immediately clear what types of assistance the government will allow. Widodo’s government shunned outside assistance after an earthquake devastated the eastern island of Lombok earlier this year. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, meanwhile, said the government had allocated 560 billion rupiah (US$37.58 million) for disaster recovery, media reported. But Widodo’s government will likely need to reach much deeper into its coffers to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe that increasingly risks being exacerbated by lawless chaos.

,"At a Glance A 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred Friday evening local time on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The quake triggered a tsunami, according to Indonesia's geophysics agency. A 6.1 magnitude foreshock struck earlier in the day, killing at least one person. A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi Friday evening just hours after a powerful, deadly foreshock, apparently triggered a tsunami that hit the coast minutes later. The main tremor struck at 6:02 p.m. local time Friday evening (6:02 a.m. EDT) about 35 miles northeast of Donggala, Indonesia a town of about 300,000 according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Shortly after, a tsunami warning was issued by Indonesia's geophysics agency, then lifted. It's believed the tsunami, confirmed by local agencies to be up to 10 feet tall, struck Donggala and Palu, a coastal town of about 330,000 after the alert was cancelled. Hary Tirto Djatmiko, a spokesman for the agency, confirmed to the Associated Press that a tsunami occurred and more information would be released once it was gathered. ""Based on historical data and tsunami modelling, this earthquake is not capable of generating a tsunami affecting the Indian Ocean region,"" said the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysical Agency of Indonesia. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency, told a local TV station that houses were carried away by the tsunami and families were missing, but darkness hindered the search Friday night. ""The situation is chaotic, people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore,"" Dwikorita Karnawati, head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency, told BBC.com. There were at least 10 foreshocks and aftershocks recorded at magnitude 5 or stronger on Friday. The main quake was relatively shallow in preliminary observations just 6.2 miles deep, according to the USGS. Earlier Friday, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake killed one person, injured several others and damaged dozens of homes, according to the AP. ""It happened while we still have difficulties in collecting data from nine villages affected by the first quake,"" an official with Akris, the local disaster agency, told the AP. ""People ran out in panic."" The tremors came a month after a large earthquake killed as many as 500 on the island of Lombok, southwest of Sulawesi.

Reuters Editorial,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - At least 384 people were killed, many swept away as giant waves crashed onto beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday. Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path. The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. “When the (tsunami) threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta. “The tsunami didn’t come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the shoreline. Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations showed waves crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies being lined up along the street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered with clothes. Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu. Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water. Graphic: Sulawesi map - tmsnrt.rs/2OYa4YD DEATH TOLL SEEN RISING Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday. The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people. Indonesia’s Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in statement the energy released by Friday’s massive quake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two. The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, it said. Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed. A bridge was washed away and the main highway to Palu was cut off due to a landslide. Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing. Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors, TV images showed. Nugroho said the casualties and the damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake. Communications “were totally crippled with no information” from Donggala, Nugroho said. More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu. “We’re now getting limited communications about the destruction in Palu city, but we have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying. There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas. “This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” it said. Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the death toll could rise to thousands. PRESIDENT TO VISIT DISASTER AREA Indonesia’s meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued. In amateur footage shared on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below. Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars. Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage. The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts. The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly need food and other basic necessities. The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct. 4 for commercial flights, Nugroho said. The airport’s runway and air traffic control tower were damaged in the quake, authorities said. President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In August, a series of major quakes killed more than 500 people in the tourist island of Lombok and destroyed dozens of villages along its northern coast. Palu was hit by tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to BNPB.

The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down shopping malls, hotels and other buildings in the city of Palu, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront. But perhaps more deadly was soil liquefaction which obliterated several Palu neighborhoods. No one knows how many people are missing but it is at least in the hundreds, rescuers say. The official death toll has risen to 1,763 but bodies are still being recovered, at least 34 in one place alone on Saturday and more on Sunday. “Many of us are angry that we haven’t found our families and friends and they want to give up?” said Hajah Ikaya, 60, who says she lost her sister, brother-in-law and niece in the Balaroa neighborhood in the south of the city. They are all missing. Balaroa was one of areas particularly hard hit by liquefaction, which turns the ground into a roiling quagmire, destroying houses and dragging people under the mud and debris. The disaster agency said earlier liquefaction destroyed 1,700 houses in one neighborhood alone with hundreds of people buried in the mud. “We’re Muslim. We need a proper burial, in the Islamic way,” said Ikaya. “We don’t want this.” Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta some limited searching might continue but large-scale searches with many personnel and heavy equipment would cease on Oct. 11. Debris would be cleared and areas hit by liquefaction would be turned into parks and sports venues. Surveys would be carried out and people living in vulnerable places would be moved. “We don’t want the community to be relocated to such dangerous places,” Nugroho said. Most of the dead from the quake and tsunami were in Palu, the region’s main urban center. Figures for more remote areas are trickling in but they seem to have suffered fewer deaths than the city. Dede Diman, 25, a resident of Petobo, another neighborhood in Palu that was laid waste by liquefaction, said rescuers hadn’t even started searching where his sister was lost. “We’re already angry,” said Diman, who is living in a shelter with his brother and another sister. Their mother was killed and her body found. “We don’t agree with giving up. Even if they give up, we won’t. We want to find our sister.” Graphic: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo PRAYERS Mohammad Irfan, 25, got home to Palu on Sunday, as air services picked up, from his job on Bali island, to help search for his missing grandfather. “I’d feel very sad if the search mission ends because there are so many still missing and buried,” he said. A grieving father was resigned to the search ending without his two-year-old daughter being found. “What’s the point anyway? At this stage, they’re not even recognizable,” said Ondre, 38, who makes toys for a living. His wife and two daughters were swept away in the tsunami that hit Palu’s seafront after the earthquake. He found the bodies of his wife and older daughter but is still looking for his younger daughter. “I don’t want her to feel like her father never tried to find her. My soul wouldn’t rest,” he said by a mass grave atop a hill overlooking Palu’s bay as the sun set, where he had come to offer prayers. Sulawesi is one of Indonesia’s five main islands. The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunami. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Earlier on Sunday, dozens of Christians gathered outside ruined churches for services to give thanks for their survival and to mourn members of their congregation killed in the disaster. Indonesia has the world’s biggest Muslim population but there are Christian communities throughout the archipelago, including in Palu. “We are so relieved to be alive but sad because so many of our congregation died,” said Dewi Febriani, 26, after a service in a tent outside the Toraja Church in Jono Oge village, south of Palu. Jono Oge was hit hard by liquefaction with dozens of teenagers at a nearby church and Bible camp killed. Many of lie buried in the mud.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Electricity was restored and some shops reopened in Indonesia’s quake and tsunami stricken city of Palu on Thursday, but the fate of many thousands of people in outlying districts was unknown nearly a week after the disaster struck. The small city of 370,000 people has been the focus of the aid effort launched after last Friday’s 7.5 magnitude earthquake and tsunami on the west coast of Sulawesi island. (GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo ) International help in searching for survivors has gathered pace, but communities in more remote areas have been cut off by broken roads, landslides and crippled communications, leaving people increasingly desperate for basic needs as aid has only just begun to trickle through. By Thursday, the official death toll stood at 1,424, but it will certainly rise as bodies were still being recovered in Palu, where most of the dead have been counted. Figures for more remote areas were only trickling in, if at all. “There are so many challenges with this disaster, it’s never been so bad,” said Frida Sinta, an aid volunteer trying to get basic food and other supplies out to fellow residents of Palu. The city, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, has teetered close to chaos this week, with outbreaks of looting, but a recovery was evident as some shops and banks reopened and a major mobile phone network was back up. Orderly queues formed at petrol stations after the arrival of fuel shipments and late in the day, traffic lights and televisions flickered back to life as the power came back on. The improvements are helping with the aid effort. “We carry whatever we can by car or motorbike within the city wherever we can. But not yet to the most inaccessible places,” Sinta said. Altogether, the badly affected areas in the disaster zone include some 1.4 million people. Rescue workers are pushing into outlying districts, where residents say they have been scavenging for coconuts, bananas and cassava. Villagers rushed a Red Cross helicopter that landed near the town of Donggala, northwest of Palu, to distribute bread and other food, a Reuters photographer said. National disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing the main roads to the south, west and east of Palu had been opened. But there has been scant information about conditions on the road to the north, along the coast toward the epicenter of the quake, 78 km (50 miles) from Palu. “There’s no data,” said Abdul Haris of the national search and rescue agency, when asked about the string of small settlements that line the road, which passes some sandy beaches that attract a trickle of tourists. “GOD DOES NOT STRIKE TWICE” While the power is back in Palu, it will take much longer for people to pick up the pieces of their lives. “We will start again here ourselves because God does not strike twice,” said Eko Joko who was building a new house, a wooden A-frame home, in the midst of a wasteland of concrete, mangled sheets of iron and uprooted trees near Palu’s beach.. In Palu’s Balaroa district, badly hit by deadly soil liquefaction, Asril Abdul Hamid, 35, was poking through the wreckage of his home. He salvaged a few mementoes including a family portrait. “My immediate family is safe, thank God, but my cousin was killed,” he told Reuters, adding that his family had got food and water in the past few days. Not far away, rescuers were using small flags to mark the location of bodies found in the debris. “We discovered eight bodies with the rescue team but we haven’t been able to bring them out because we don’t have the right equipment,” said district police chief Andi Samsudin Effendy. The body of a South Korean man, who had been in Palu for a sports event, was also found in the ruins of a hotel where dozens of people were killed. Just to the east of Palu, the 500-tonne KM Sabuk Nusantara 39, lies, high and dry in a dock-side settlement, where the tsunami picked it up and dumped it. No one on board was hurt. Engineer Charles Marlan, waiting with fellow crewmen on board the marooned ship for its owners to decide what to do, said he was thankful his ship had not killed anyone on land, as far as they knew. “What is important is we are alive and for that we should be grateful,” he said. Straddling the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia has long been vulnerable to quakes and tsunamis. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

Australians have a long tradition of abbreviating and slackening words and phrases, particularly by adding “ie” to the end. “Aussie” appears in references from World War I. A book by Gertrude Moberly, recounting the experiences of a nurse, described a “farewell dance for the boys going home to ‘Aussie’ tomorrow.” And Australians always have their “mates.” The nation’s unique camaraderie, known as mateship, is especially evident during commemorations of the Australian and New Zealand Armed Corps (or Anzacs), the World War I-era fighting force.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Hungry survivors of an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia said on Wednesday they were scavenging for food in farms as President Joko Widodo made a second visit to the area to ramp up aid efforts five days after disaster struck. The official death toll from the 7.5 magnitude quake that hit the west coast of Sulawesi island last Friday rose to 1,407, many killed by tsunami waves it triggered. (GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo ) But officials fear the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead have come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, and losses in remote areas remain unknown, as communications are down, and bridges and roads have been destroyed or blocked by landslides. National disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said most of the aid effort had been concentrated in Palu, where electricity supply has yet to be restored. But rescue workers have begun to reach more remote areas in a disaster zone that encompasses 1.4 million people. Johnny Lim, a restaurant owner reached by telephone in Donggala town, said he was surviving on coconuts. “It’s a zombie town. Everything’s destroyed. Nothing’s left,” Lim said over a crackling line. “We’re on our last legs. There’s no food, no water.” In another part of Donggala district, which has a population of 300,000 people, Ahmad Derajat, said survivors were scavenging for food in fields and orchards. “What we’re relying on right now is food from farms and sharing whatever we find like sweet potatoes or bananas,” said Derajat whose house was swept away by the tsunami leaving a jumble of furniture, collapsed tin roofs and wooden beams. “Why aren’t they dropping aid by helicopter?” he asked. Aid worker Lian Gogali described a perilous situation in Donggala, which includes a string of cut-off, small towns along a coast road north of Palu close to the quake’s epicenter. “Everyone is desperate for food and water. There’s no food, water, or gasoline. The government is missing,” Gogali said, adding that her aid group had only been able to send in a trickle of rations by motorbike. Underlining a growing sense of urgency, President Widodo made his second visit to the disaster zone, putting on an orange hard hat to talk to rescue workers at a collapsed hotel in Palu. “What I’ve observed after returning now is heavy equipment has arrived, logistics have started to arrive although it’s not at maximum yet, fuel has partly arrived,” Widodo told reporters. ‘PRESIDENT NOT HEARING’ Widodo, who will seek re-election next year, called on Tuesday for reinforcements in the search for victims, saying everyone had to be found. He repeated that on Wednesday, after inspecting what he called an “evacuation” effort at the Hotel Roa Roa, where he said some 30 people lay buried in the ruins. Yahdi Basma, a leader from a village south of Palu hoping to get his family on a cargo plane out, said Widodo had no idea of the extent of the suffering. “The president is not hearing about the remote areas, only about the tsunami and about Palu,” he said. “There are hundreds of people still buried under the mud in my village... There is no aid whatsoever which is why we’re leaving.” At least seven cargo planes arrived at Palu airport earlier on Wednesday carrying tonnes of aid, some bedecked in the red and white national colors and stamped with the presidential office seal declaring: “Assistance from the President of Republic of Indonesia”. The quake brought down hotels, shopping malls and thousands of houses in Palu, while tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) scoured its beachfront shortly afterwards. About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said. Indonesian Red Cross disaster responders said the village of Petobo, just south of Palu, which was home to almost 500 people, had been “wiped off the map”. “They are finding devastation and tragedy everywhere,” Iris van Deinse, of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a statement. Nearby, rescue workers, some using an excavator, were searching for 52 children missing since liquefaction destroyed their bible study camp. Bodies of 35 of the children have been found. Aircraft, tents, water treatment facilities and generators were the main needs for survivors including more than 70,000 displaced people, according to the national disaster mitigation agency spokesman. Sitting on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to quakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Adding to Sulawesi’s woes, the Soputan volcano in the north of the island, 600 km (375 miles) northeast of Palu, erupted on Wednesday but there were no reports of casualties or damage.

Colin Dwyer,"Nikol Pashinyan's supporters packed a square Tuesday in the capital, Yerevan, after lawmakers rejected the opposition leader's bid for prime minister. Pashinyan is calling for a campaign of civil disobedience in protest. Vano Shlamov/AFP/Getty Images Just minutes after midnight Wednesday, Nikol Pashinyan stepped in front of a huge crowd in Armenia's capital, microphone in hand. Not long before, lawmakers had rejected the opposition leader's bid for prime minister — the only one officially in the running — after he was grilled for hours in parliament Tuesday. Now he was speaking to a different crowd: tens of thousands of his supporters packing a square in downtown Yerevan. After weeks of anti-government rallies which led to the ouster of the previous prime minister, longtime leader Serzh Sargsyan, Pashinyan told the crowd he was not giving up. ""We will block the streets, the airports, the metro, the railway, everything that can be blocked,"" he told them, according to a Reuters translation. ""If everyone participates in a total act of civil disobedience, this will be a total victory of the people of Armenia. Our struggle is a struggle of non-violence, it is a peaceful act of civil disobedience."" Nikol Pashinyan, the only candidate for prime minister, answers lawmakers' questions at the extraordinary session of parliament Tuesday. Lawmakers later rejected him, leaving the post vacant. Karen Minasyan/AFP/Getty Images Pashinyan's call for a general strike came shortly after the 42-year old former journalist saw his candidacy stamped out by Sargsyan's ruling Republican Party. Ultimately, his bid failed to win the required majority, with most of his fellow lawmakers preferring to leave the post of prime minister vacant rather than give Pashinyan the job. ""Mr. Pashinyan, you're a good parliament member,"" said Republican Party member Arman Saghatelyan, according to Al Jazeera, ""but not qualified for prime minister."" The Armenian constitution dictates that the government now has seven days to hold another election. If lawmakers fail again to decide on a new prime minister themselves, this current parliament will be dissolved and Armenian voters will have the chance to replace them all in a general election. It appears that many in the crowd backing Pashinyan, while disappointed with the day's result, eagerly welcomed an opportunity to cast their own ballots. The demonstrators are fresh off weeks of protests against Sargsyan, a two-term president whose shift to prime minister earlier this year they viewed as a cynical attempt to evade term limits. Led by Pashinyan, the protesters blocked major thoroughfares and surrounded government buildings until Sargsyan finally ceded to their objections and stepped down. ""The movement in the streets is against my tenure,"" he said in a statement last month. ""I comply with your demand."" Now, the protesters have turned to another cause: Pashinyan's election. On Tuesday, shortly before his bid failed, Pashinyan had threatened a ""political tsunami"" in the country of 3 million if he were not elected. By the time night fell, several protesters attending the rally were already echoing the sentiment. ""They spat on us but we're not going to tolerate this,"" a baker attending the post-election rally for Pashinyan told The Associated Press. ""This government just won't resign on its own will. It's tens of thousands of us, and we need them to go. We can't take this anymore.""","Despite being the only candidate to replace the recently ousted prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan failed to obtain a majority vote in parliament. Now, he's calling for a ""struggle of non-violence.""",2018-05-01T23:38:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Armenian Protest Leader Loses Bid For Premier, Warns Of A 'Political Tsunami'",https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/01/607395565/armenian-protest-leader-loses-bid-for-premier-warns-of-a-political-tsunami,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/01/gettyimages-953385930_wide-94ca73bb2821db62125e2fad8102a67de48eff65.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,tsunami,1

 The death toll after Saturday's tsunami continues to rise
It is very likely that a collapse of rocks on Indonesia's Anak Krakatau volcano caused an undersea rockslide, which in turn generated a tsunami on Saturday that has claimed hundreds of lives.
The volcano is now entering a new, deadly phase, writes California-based volcanologist Jess Phoenix as she looks at a series of spectacular images to analyse the timeline of eruptions.
Image copyrightGetty Images
In the illustration above, we see Krakatau volcano (also known as Krakatoa) from before its infamous 1883 eruption. 
The name ""Anak Krakatau"" means ""Child of Krakatau,"" so this look at the modern volcano's predecessor provides perspective for scientists. 
Krakatau was a classic cone-shaped stratovolcano (meaning it was made of layers and layers of erupted material) that appeared to be intact and large. 
The presence of the fishing vessel in the illustration indicates that despite what appears to be a small steam plume rising from the top, there were no worries about danger from the volcano.
A steam plume would be normal for a volcano that is not erupting and is caused by water heated inside of the volcano rising to the surface.

This image, taken in July 2018, is of a small eruption of Anak Krakatau, likely one that would be classified as a 0 or 1 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. 
That scale measures the amount of material erupted from a volcano and increases exponentially, with 0/1 being typical of Hawaiian eruptions, and 8 being cataclysmic, like the eruption of Yellowstone 630,000 years ago. 
These types of eruptions can occur as often as daily over the course of years without resulting in a larger eruption. 
However, it is possible that if more magma enters the system, the volcano will erupt on a larger scale.

In this photo, also from July 2018, we see incandescent material being ejected from Anak Krakatau's summit crater. 
The visible glow shows the material is still quite hot, as it will cool to a black colour with time. 
The material is cooling magma, and can form cinder, small fragments of lava known as lapilli, and larger objects called lava bombs. 
These are all dangerous to humans, and lava bombs can travel hundreds of metres from the volcano's summit vent before hitting the ground.

This aerial image from August 2018 shows Anak Krakatau as a small island mostly covered by ejected volcanic material. 
It sits in the middle of a rough circle of three other islands which make an approximate boundary of where the original Krakatau volcano was. 
The 1883 eruption caused a massive collapse of the major structures of Krakatau, and Anak Krakatau has been building up from the collapsed area since it breached sea level in 1930. 
This image documents a weak eruption plume and relatively fresh materials on the island.

By contrast, this aerial photo from September 2018 shows a vastly different situation than that of the previous image. 
A thick brown eruption column obscures one of the three boundary islands, and it shows evidence of convection, which can be seen this picture in its changing width. 
Eruption columns pose a threat to air traffic and human health, as they are composed of rock fragments that cause damage if inhaled by engines or humans. 
These rock fragments can also cause the collapse of buildings due to their weight.

This stunning photo from 23 December 2018 shows a dramatic contrast between the Anak Krakatau of today and the one we saw just a few short months ago. 
The cone itself is obscured by the violent eruption, with the interaction between superheated magma, gas, and water causing explosions that result in the water flashing to steam. 
Since Anak Krakatau is surrounded by water, there is even greater interaction of water and hot volcanic materials, which produces more steam and a messy-looking eruption.

Volcanoes can create their own lightning, as this Anak Krakatau image also taken on 23 December 2018 shows. 
The mid-air collision of fragmented rock, volcanic ash, and water can create a static charge. 
The volcano itself is obscured by the eruption column. 
The lightning does not come down from storm clouds, but rather from the eruption column itself discharging the static energy through a process called charge separation.
Of course, volcanoes don't erupt in a vacuum. Their impacts are felt locally, and sometimes regionally or globally. 
The new phase of eruptive activity of Anak Krakatau has come with an unusual tragedy in the form of a tsunami. 
With the data currently available, it appears that the tsunami that hit the western end of the island of Java may have been the result of a collapse of part of Anak Krakatau that triggered an underwater rockslide. 
That displacement of rock likely generated the deadly tsunami, some effects of which are pictured above. 
Volcanic hazards are not new to Indonesia, and the effects of the latest eruption of Anak Krakatau should serve as a reminder that we need additional study, education, and preparedness measures to keep people and property safe during volcanic disasters and their aftermath.

Agustinus Beo Da Costa,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi jumped to 384 on Saturday, authorities said, with many of those killed swept away by giant waves as they played on the beach. Strong aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday morning after waves up to six meters (18 feet) high swept through the scenic tourist town on Friday, triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on land. “When the (tsunami) threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in news briefing in Jakarta. Hundreds of people were preparing for a beach festival to celebrate Palu’s anniversary. The festival was due to start Friday night. Some people climbed six meter (18 feet) trees to escape the tsunami and survived, Nugroho said. Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies being lined up along the street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered with clothes. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” with thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, a bridge washed away and the main highway to Palu cut due to a landslide. Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured. Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors, TV images showed. Indonesia’s meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. The agency has been widely criticized for not informing a tsunami had hit Palu on Saturday, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued. The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu and on Saturday authorities were still having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts. The disaster mitigation agency has not been able to get any information from the fishing town of Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the quake 27 km (16 miles) away. More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu. Chief security minister Wiranto told TVOne the military had started sending in cargo planes from the capital Jakarta carrying relief aid. The city’s airport remained closed after its runway and air traffic control tower was damaged in the quake but officials said they were preparing to reopen to allow aid to come in. Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said no command center for disaster recovery has been created yet. The Palu area was hit by a less powerful quake earlier on Friday, which destroyed some houses, killed one person and injured at least 10 in Donggala, authorities said. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In August, a series of major quakes killed over 500 people in the tourist island of Lombok and destroyed dozens of villages along its northern coast. Palu was hit by tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to BNPB.

DAVID M. HALBFINGER,"Theres a certain justification for that, Mr. Pfeffer said.
The left wing always said, Heres the deal: If you dont solve your issues with the Palestinians and end the occupation, and resolve your outstanding issues with Arab countries, you wont realize your incredible potential, he said. Youll have a spartan lifestyle, youll have to go to war all the time, and the world may isolate you the diplomatic tsunami. And its inarguable that in the last 10 years, Netanyahu has broken this paradigm.
Yet, at the same time, Mr. Netanyahu has fueled and directed the right wings animosity at predominantly liberal institutions like the courts, the police, higher education and the news media. To the left, Israeli democracy is on the defensive. To the ethnonationalist right, which succeeded last year in enshrining Israels self-definition as the nation-state of the Jews in a basic law, it is in need of an adjustment.
Somebody told me that Israel went really far on the democracy side, and now we have to rebalance it, said Dahlia Scheindlin, a liberal pollster and writer. They see it as a corrective, that Israel has too healthy a democracy.
Some, including Mr. Gantz, have warned that Mr. Netanyahu was headed down a path toward a regime like that of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.
Mr. Pfeffer said Israel was not there yet.
Those other countries dont have the institutions that can indict the prime minister, he said. It hasnt happened here; the media and judiciary are still strong. But once you erode democracy, you make it much easier for the incumbent to win.","In re-electing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israelis endorsed a politician who offered himself as the embodiment of stability and military and economic security.",2019-04-10T11:15:49Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",News Analysis: It’s Bibi’s Israel Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/world/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-election.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/09/world/09HFO-netanyahu-israel1/09HFO-netanyahu-israel1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tsunami,1
ANDREW E. KRAMER,"Mr. Putin also noted what he called progress on Russias development of new types of nuclear weapons not covered by the treaty, including a drone submarine called Poseidon that carries a massive thermonuclear warhead designed to detonate in shallow coastal waters, flooding the enemys ports and seaside cities with a radioactive tsunami.
In his remarks, the Russian minister of foreign affairs, Sergey V. Lavrov, presented a picture of the wobbly state of the whole architecture of American and Russian nuclear disarmament that had been erected over the past 50 years, beginning with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.
Mr. Lavrov suggested a number of treaties were in need of urgent review, such as the Nonproliferation Treaty that prohibits passing nuclear weapons technology to countries that do not already posses it. He argued that America had violated it by conducting nuclear deterrence training exercises with NATO nations that were not declared nuclear powers.
Chinas array of nuclear weapons remains much smaller than the American and Russian forces, but Beijing has been upgrading and expanding its arsenal. Some critics of the intermediate nuclear forces treaty have argued that it unfairly ties the United States hands from responding effectively to Chinas military buildup.
In October, President Trump cited Chinas potential expansion as a reason the United States should consider quitting the treaty.
If Russias doing it and if Chinas doing it, and were adhering to the agreement, thats unacceptable, Mr. Trump said after a rally in Nevada.
In January, Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party-controlled tabloid newspaper with a heavily nationalist tone, reported that a Peoples Liberation Army unit had carried out an exercise with an intermediate-range ship killer missile formally called the DF-26. China probably has 16 to 30 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, an annual Pentagon report on Chinas military said last year.","Russia will no longer observe the 1987 nuclear pact, which the Trump administration suspended on Friday.

DAVID WALDSTEIN,"Professional tennis has several tiers, much like baseball with its major leagues and several levels of minor leagues below them. The best and most famous tennis players play in ATP or WTA tournaments. The rest, as many as 14,000 of them, toil anonymously around the globe in small events that are supposed to serve as tenniss talent incubator.
Patrascu is one of those. Born in Bucharest, Romania, in 1997, she moved to Toronto with her parents when she was 5. She showed promise as a junior, winning the Canadian under-14 championship, and turned professional at 18. But her career-high ranking is No. 615 in the I.T.F. and No. 819 in the WTA.
Most players chances of making it to stardom are slim, and for many, it is challenging to just break even financially after paying for travel, training and other expenses. That is why the I.T.F., after commissioning an extensive study, declared the old structure unsustainable. Too many marginal players were basically masquerading as professionals.
The I.T.F.s mission is to promote tennis around the world, and the organization works to ensure that there are tournaments on all continents. But those events have been open to all comers, and they have included players with little hope of breaking into the top tier some of them over 50 years old. The I.T.F. study determined that in one year, as many as 6,000 so-called professional players did not earn even $1. A recent independent investigation also found that there was a tsunami of fixed matches at the lower levels, where players earning little prize money are vulnerable to betting syndicates.
The I.T.F. determined that the best model for professional tennis should include no more than 750 men and 750 women. It recommended new rules to restructure the tour, effectively eliminating almost 13,000 aspirants.","Maria Patrascu, never ranked higher than 600th, has emerged as the spokeswoman for those angry about rules designed to slash the number of pro tennis players.",2019-03-17T21:58:35Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trying to Change Pro Tennis One Signature at a Time,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/sports/tennis/itf-tour-petition.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/12/sports/12itf-tour-1/12itf-tour-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tsunami,1
Francesca Paris,"Indonesian soldiers search the bodies of tsunami victims at a beach resort on the island of Java on Monday. Waves swept terrified people into the sea Saturday night following an eruption on Anak Krakatau, one of the world's most infamous volcanic islands.
Achmad Ibrahim/AP
Rescue crews are helping thousands of people who were injured or displaced after a tsunami struck the coasts of Java and Sumatra in Indonesia on Saturday night. Manyresidents did not receive any warning before the tsunami, which killed hundreds. 
Volcanic activity on Indonesia's famous Anak Krakatau island triggered underwater landslides that caused the tsunami, officials say. Anak Krakatau emerged from the site of an 1883 eruption that killed tens of thousands of people, and has drawn tourists from around the world.
At least 373 people have died, with 128 missing and nearly 1,500 wounded, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency. 
Crews continue to search for survivors while retrieving bodies from the wreckage with heavy machinery and their hands, Reuters reports. 
The Red Cross has dispatched 22 ambulances and over a hundred volunteers to transport the injured. Blocked streets have hindered access to health centers in Pandeglang, on the island of Java, where Doctors Without Borders volunteers are helping to treat patients injured by the tsunami and falling rubble. 
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at the disaster zone on Monday, while military and volunteers continue to search affected areas. Authorities have warned residents to stay away from beaches because of the risk of continued volcanic activity.
The tsunami caught residents by surprise because the country's seismic activity detectors were not functioning properly, NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports. Nugroho acknowledged Indonesia's detection buoys have been dysfunctional since 2012, according to the Associated Press, a result of vandalism and budget issues.
Kathy Mueller, a communications delegate with the Red Cross, was working in Indonesia when the tsunami hit because of ongoing recovery efforts after a previous tsunami in September, which killed over 1700 people. 
She says Saturday's tsunami affected Java's entire western coastline.
""There are a lot of communities we know ... have not yet been accessed,"" she told NPR's David Greene. ""It's going to take some time before we get a fully clear picture of what the full extent of the damage is.""
The Indonesian Red Cross dispatched more than 117 volunteers to the affected area immediately after the disaster, Mueller says. They brought basic supplies, including blankets, clothes, food and water. 
The tsunami struck Indonesia's two most populous islands. Proximity to the nation's capitol, Jakarta, has facilitated the mobilization of volunteers, military and emergency personnel, compared to previous disasters.
Mueller adds that emergency respondents have become proficient at purifying drinking water since the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, which killed over 200,000 people.
But she says three major disasters since the summer massive earthquakes on the island of Lombok in July and again in August, followed by the September's tsunami and earthquake on the island of Sulawesi have taxed the country, even before the latest tsunami.
""People are a little bit tired now,"" she says.
On Sulawesi, thousands of residents still live in tented camps, according to Mueller.
Now this disaster has displaced 11,000 more people in Java and Sumatra, who are residing in government buildings and camping out in tents beside hospitals. 
""A lot of them were holidaymakers,"" Kuhn says. ""The government has tried to turn the western tip of Java into a new tourist destination to rival the island of Bali. But that effort has been suspended after this disaster.""
Several of the dead were members of the local pop-rock band Seventeen, which was performing at a year-end party in Java when the tsunami struck, sweeping away performers and concert-goers.","Warning systems failed to alert residents of danger when volcanic activity triggered a tsunami on Saturday.

Reuters Editorial,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - At least 30 people were killed when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the city of Palu on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island on Friday, a hospital official told Metro TV in a report broadcast on Saturday. A tsunami up to two meters (six feet) high swept through Palu at dusk after the sleepy but growing tourist resort was rocked by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. “Bodies of victims were found in several places, because they were hit by the rubble of collapsing buildings or swept by tsunami... but we are still collecting data,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman said on Saturday. Doctor Komang Adi Sujendra told Metro TV that 30 people were killed and their bodies taken to his hospital, adding another 12 injured needed orthopaedic surgery. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Nugroho declined to give an official death toll. The Palu area was hit by a lighter quake earlier on Friday, which destroyed some houses, killed one person and injured at least 10 in the fishing town of Donggala, closest to the epicenter, authorities said. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7. The quake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut communications around Palu. On Saturday, authorities were still having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts without power and communications as the area was rocked by aftershocks. Metro TV played an amateur footage which showed water remaining from the tsunami, a collapsed bridge, large cracks in roads and buildings badly damaged. Tezar Kodongan, a resident of Palu who took one of the videos, told the TV station some of the city landmarks were broken. “There is no evacuation yet in the disaster area,” Kodongan added.

https://www.facebook.com/sim.alva,"As China gears up for Model 3 deliveries to begin in the country, the interest and anticipation for the electric car among reservation holders and potential buyers appear to be reaching a fever pitch. If reports from Chinese social media are any indication, it seems that waves of Model 3 orders are already hitting the countrys stores. 
For the Model 3 to be successful in China, the electric car must be good enough to attract a lot of attention and demand from the car-buying public. Recent reports from Chinese social media users suggest that consumers are indeed interested in the Model 3. During the past few days alone, social media posts from the region noted that some Tesla stores ended up having system issues due to the influx of orders they are receiving for the Model 3.

Other posts from the area were equally optimistic. A Weibo user who took the electric car for a test drive on February 13, for one, observed that her sales representatives mobile phone was receiving notifications for Model 3 orders every 6-10 minutes. During the chat with the Tesla specialist, I observed that his cellphone popped three times with new Model 3 orders in about 20-30 mins. In other words, about 6-10 minutes, there is a Model 3 sold in that location, , the Weibo user, wrote. 
Last week, reports emerged stating that the Glovis Symphony, a cargo ship loaded with China-bound Model 3, has arrived at the Tianjin Port. Other ships loaded with the sedan, such as the solar-hybrid car carrier, Emerald Ace, are expected to arrive in China within the next weeks as well, as noted in a report from local news outlet CCTV. With these factors in mind, it appears that Model 3 deliveries in China would likely begin very soon.

It remains to be seen if the Model 3 would be as big of a success in China as it was in the United States, where its disruption was so notable that it became the countrys best-selling luxury vehicle in 2018. Nevertheless, the reception that the car has received from Chinese auto media and social media users appears to be mostly positive so far. In a review of the Model 3 Performance by Chinese auto group Know the Car, for one, it was concluded that the electric car could outperform rival premium, high-performance sedans such as the BMW M3 and the Mercedes-AMG C63 at the racetrack. 
Tesla has been pushing some offers to make the Model 3 an attractive purchase for Chinese buyers. Earlier this month, for example, Tesla opted to include Enhanced Autopilot, an add-on that previously cost 46,300 yuan (around $6,800), as standard for all Model 3 purchases in the country.","As China gears up for Model 3 deliveries to begin in the country, the interest and anticipation for the electric car among reservation holders and potential buyers appear to be reaching a fever pitch.

As it turns out, the king of the Moogles has an unlikely origin: one of Japan’s biggest natural disasters. At E3 in Los Angeles earlier this month, I asked Final Fantasy XIV composer Masayoshi Soken where that ridiculous chanting song had come from, and he told me the whole origin story of Good King Moggle Mog, a Primal enemy who launched during Final Fantasy XIV 1.0, before the developers at Square Enix took down the game and re-launched it as A Realm Reborn in 2013. “We were working on two Primals at the time, Leviathan and Titan,” said Soken, speaking through a translator. “But of course March 11 happened with the tsunami and the earthquake.” That’d be March 11, 2011, the day a massive earthquake hit Japan, triggering a tsunami and killing thousands upon thousands of people. Given that Final Fantasy ’s Leviathan and Titan, beasts of water and earth, use “Tsunami” and “Earthquake” as their respective main spells, the team suddenly had to pivot. “Leviathan and Titan being ‘Tsunami’ and ‘Earthquake,’ there was no way we could release this content,” Soken said. “We were scrambling wondering: ‘What could we have the players fight?’ The only thing we had the models for was Moogles. There was a Moogle theme that Mr. Uematsu had previously composed, so I took that and made it have more of a devil feel to it. Moogles as you know are floating around, being cheerful. Imagine that gigantified and trying to beat up the players. In my mind I was thinking, ‘How do you take that song, cute cheerful song, and make it more devil-like?’” The final product, which Soken admits was very inspired by Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas, doesn’t sound devil-like at all. In fact, it’s one of the silliest things in the game: “But I mean, listening to the finished product it still sounds very comical,” said Soken. “With the original source music being so comical, I guess no matter how you tweak it, it still came off comical.”","One of Final Fantasy XIV ’s most memorable bosses is Good King Moggle Mog, a giant demonic moogle whose Tim Burton-inspired theme song has been haunting players since the game’s earliest days.

JILL LAWLESS / AP,"(LONDON) — A senior British opposition politician said Sunday that it’s unlikely the U.K. will leave the European Union as scheduled on March 29, while a government minister warned that failure to deliver on Brexit would betray voters and unleash a “political tsunami.”
The Brexit process has been deadlocked since Prime Minister Theresa May’s divorce deal with the EU was rejected by Parliament last week. Some lawmakers are pushing for the U.K. to delay its departure until politicians can agree on a way forward.
Labour Party Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said “it’s inevitable” Britain will have to ask the EU to extend the two-year Brexit countdown that ends on March 29.
“The 29th of March is 68 days away,” Starmer told the BBC. “We are absolutely not prepared for it. It would be catastrophic.”
Britain’s political impasse over Brexit is fueling concerns that the country may crash out of the EU on March 29 with no agreement in place to cushion the shock. That could see tariffs imposed on goods moving between Britain and the EU, sparking gridlock at ports and shortages of essential supplies. Many economists expect Britain to plunge into recession if there is a “no-deal” Brexit.
May’s government is split between ministers who think a “no-deal” Brexit must be avoided at all casts, and Brexit-backers who believe it would be preferable to delaying or reversing Brexit.
Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, who quit the government in opposition to May’s agreement with the EU, said a no-deal Brexit would have “short-term risks,” but they would be “manageable.”
International Trade Secretary Liam Fox wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that “failure to deliver Brexit would produce a yawning gap between Parliament and the people, a schism in our political system with unknowable consequences.”
He said public anger could trigger “a political tsunami.”
May has spent the last few days meeting government and opposition lawmakers, and is due to report to Parliament Monday on how she plans to alter the rejected deal. The talks have produced few signs that May plans to make radical changes.
Lawmakers who want a softer Brexit are preparing to try to amend May’s plans in a Jan. 29 debate, and to use parliamentary rules to try to prevent a “no-deal” Brexit and take control of the exit process.
Speaking on the BBC, Fox said that “Parliament has not got the right to hijack the Brexit process.”
But Starmer said there was a roadblock in the way of a solution to the Brexit crisis, “and that roadblock is the prime minister.”
“Her mind is closed,” he said.

Ray Cavanaugh,"The molasses tank operated by the Purity Distilling Company in Boston’s North End had been leaking from the start. Employees had expressed concern that the giant tank, which measured 50 feet in height and had a diameter of 90 feet, was a safety hazard. Its owners even painted the tank the color of molasses in an effort to mask the constant leaks.
Less concerned were the neighborhood children, who could fill their cans with free molasses from the drippings. But around 12:30 pm on Jan. 15, 1919, following a quick succession of unnaturally loud ominous sounds, the North End in a span of seconds received more of the syrup than anyone could collect in a lifetime. And it was anything but free.
The distillery tank had exploded and released its contents in a spectacular wave some 25 feet in height and 165 feet wide. Despite the “slow as molasses” cliché, a tsunami of the thick syrup crashed through the neighborhood at a reported 35 mph. Molasses may not seem to be the most dangerous of substances, but when 2.3 million gallons are unleashed at once, it can demolish buildings, tear apart train tracks, rip a fire station from its foundation, and drown or suffocate dogs, horses and people.

This bizarre and terrifying event, known as the Great Molasses Flood, claimed 21 lives, with victims ranging in age from 10 to 78. Some 150 persons were injured, and the damage to property — much of which had cascaded into nearby Boston Harbor — amounted to about $100 million in today’s money.
The ensuing rescue effort lasted four days, as firemen and police, among others, struggled to contend with quicksand-like conditions and attend to persons who were not only maimed but literally stuck in their horrendous predicament. Early newspaper articles misreported the number of dead because the often-impenetrable mess delayed an accurate fatality count.
In the aftermath of such chaos came an investigation, which determined that the man who supervised the distillery tank’s construction not only lacked technical training, but also was unable to read blueprints. Furthermore, no legitimate engineers or architects had been commissioned to assess the structure.
But the U.S. Industrial Alcohol (USIA) corporation, which owned the Purity Distilling Company that operated the molasses tank, claimed that the explosion was not the result of substandard construction but was instead an act of sabotage perpetrated by anarchists.
In theory, the claim was plausible, as anarchists and their dynamiting tactics were common during that time. In fact, the Boston area had experienced 40 explosive incidents in the year leading up to the Molasses Flood. Moreover, anarchists had bombed USIA facilities in New York several years before, and one employee reported having received a bomb threat against the tank in Boston.
However, the ensuing court case, which lasted more than five years, decided that no act of sabotage had taken place and that structural failure was the cause of the explosion. Two days before the explosion, the temperature was a mere 2° F. But on Jan. 15, the temperature had climbed to about 40°, increasing pressure within the tank. Additionally, a recent delivery of warm molasses was mixing with the cooler molasses that had been inside the tank for weeks. Such a mix of significantly differing temperatures produced gas and added to the air pressure within the tank, which hadn’t been able to take it.
Because of the court’s ruling, the USIA was compelled to pay restitution amounting to about $15 million in today’s money.
Although this penalty was relatively moderate given the extent of death and destruction, it still carried the message that the legal system could hold businesses culpable for unsafe structures. In the words of architect William J. Hirsch Jr., author of Designing Your Perfect House: Lessons from an Architect, put it, “Accountability in construction was born.”
A sign of such accountability was the Boston Building Department’s requirement that any architect or engineer must include a signature along with all relevant calculations on building plans. As this requirement became standard practice nationwide, America’s freewheeling days of unregulated large-scale construction and do-it-yourself engineering came to an end.
Before long, all U.S. states had also instituted laws requiring engineers to have professional certification — something that the “engineer” of the giant North End tank had most certainly lacked. Additionally, in order for a municipality or state to grant a building permit, the plans for any large structure needed to bear the seal of a registered engineer.
Stephen Puleo, author of Dark Tide: The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919, views the Molasses Flood as a pivotal event that did for U.S. construction standards what the Cocoanut Grove fire did for fire codes.
Though not quite as impactful as the enhanced safety regulations, a syrupy aroma was purported to have lingered in Boston’s North End for decades. It would resurface on hot days, serving as an eerily sweet reminder of what can happen when amateurs undertake jobs that ought to be left to professionals.

Tom McKay,"A terrifying wall of lava from Kilauea volcano in its East Rift Zone has destroyed two entire tracts of suburban housing containing at least 280 units in the eastern part of Hawaii’s Big Island, Reuters reported on Wednesday, meaning that the ongoing eruption there has now claimed at least 350 homes. According to Reuters, the volcanic activity in the past few weeks exceeds the entirety of damage since Kilauea’s current eruption cycle began some 35 years ago: The obliteration of the Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacationland subdivisions by a churning river of molten rock some 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.6 meters) tall brings to at least 350 the number of homes and other structures consumed by volcanic lava during the past month. That latest toll of property losses from Kilauea’s ongoing upheaval, which entered its 35th day on Wednesday, far surpasses the 215 structures destroyed by lava during all 35 years of the volcano’s last eruption cycle, which began in 1983. US Geological Survey (USGS) vulcanologist Wendy Stovall told Reuters that the Vacationland subdivision is “gone” with “no evidence of any properties there at all.” Only a few homes are left standing in the other community, Stovall added. Land access to the region was cut off on Saturday when lava flows swept over existing roads, Reuters wrote, mere hours after remaining residents were able to evacuate with the assistance of authorities. As the New York Times noted, USGS footage shows that the eruption on Kilauea is already reshaping the island’s coastline and forming a delta in what was formerly known as Kapoho Bay— producing toxic clouds of hydrochloric acid, steam, and tiny glass particles in the process. Ikaika Marzo, a local tour guide, told the Times that the entirety of the bay was now covered in a spiny type of lava flow called “a’ā.” According to ABC News, a magnitude 5.6 earthquake struck the summit of Kilauea on Wednesday, which could cause ash to fall over the nearby towns of Volcano and Pahala. No tsunami risk was expected, though a live webcam of the summit on YouTube showed clouds of gas and ash pouring outward in the wake of the event.

Fergus Jensen,"LABUAN, Indonesia (Reuters) - The death toll from a tsunami that hit the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra after the Anak Krakatau volcano erupted rose to at least 280 on Monday, officials said, as rescuers using heavy machinery and their bare hands searched for more victims. 
Hundreds more were injured when the tsunami struck, almost without warning, along the rim of the Sunda Strait late on Saturday. More than 3,000 coastal residents were forced to evacuate to higher ground, with a high-tide warning in place until Tuesday. 
The vast archipelago, which sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade. Earthquakes flattened parts of the tourist island of Lombok in July and August, and a double quake-and-tsunami killed more than 2,000 people on Sulawesi island in September. 
Search and rescue officials used their bare hands and some heavy machinery to clear the remains of buildings on Monday. Government and non-government aid trickled in to Pandeglang, the worst-affected area on Java’s west coast. 
Indonesia’s disaster agency had put the death toll at 222 on Sunday, with about 850 injured and 28 people missing, but raised it to 280 early on Monday. A disaster mitigation agency official in Banten province named Jhony told reporters most victims were Indonesian holidaymakers. 
Dudi Dwiriadi, a district military commander, said personnel and volunteers had been briefed to sweep at least 100 km (60 miles) of coastline in search of victims. 
The timing of the tsunami over the Christmas holiday season evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. 
Graphic of disaster zone: tmsnrt.rs/2RdjsMd
ROADS BLOCKED 
Some roads remained blocked by debris and traffic, with families streaming out of the area for fear of further tsunamis. 
President Joko Widodo, who is running for re-election in April, was scheduled to visit the area later on Monday. 
Television images showed when the tsunami hit the beach and residential areas in Pandeglang, dragging with it victims, debris, and large chunks of wood and metal. 
Many coastal residents reported not seeing or feeling any warning signs, such as an earthquake, on Saturday night before waves of 2-3 meters (6-10 feet) washed ashore. 
Yuni, a resident of Lampung in Sumatra, was watching television at home when she heard the water coming. 
“I heard a rumbling sound and I thought it was the wind. After I opened the door, water came in quickly and dragged me out. When I saw outside, the sea was receding. I decided to run and go as the water came again for the second time,” she said. 
Roman, a resident of the area who operates tours to Anak Krakatau, said by text message the weather had been fine when the waves struck, although residents had become wary of the rumbling volcano. 
He said many others had taken refuge in his elevated village of Tahura Carita, which is about 100 meters from the sea. Evacuees were relying on instant noodles, he said. 
Heavy equipment was being moved in to help with rescue efforts, as well as water and sanitation equipment. The military said it was deploying troops to distribute aid and blankets, as well as sending in medics. 
The western coast of Banten province in Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, was also badly hit, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency. 
At least 48 people were reported dead in Lampung in southern Sumatra, he said. 
With the exact cause of the disaster still unknown, authorities were wary of the risk of a recurrence. Public works minister Basuki Hadimuljono said emergency operations would be carried out continuously but “would stop at the first sign of possible high tides”. 
“WASHED AWAY” 
Television footage showed how the tsunami washed away an outdoor stage where Indonesian rock band Seventeen was performing for hundreds of guests at an end-of-year party for state utility company PLN. 
At least four band members and support crew were killed, lead singer Riefian “Ifan” Fajarsyah told followers in a tearful Instagram account. The band’s drummer was among the missing. 
Another 29 PLN employees and relatives were also killed. 
Anak Krakatau, roughly halfway between Java and Sumatra, has been spewing ash and lava for months. It erupted again just after 9 p.m. on Saturday and the tsunami struck about 30 minutes later, according to the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG). 
The tsunami was caused by an undersea landslide resulting from volcanic activity on Anak Krakatau and was exacerbated by abnormally high tides because of the full moon, Nugroho said. 
Ben van der Pluijm, an earthquake geologist and professor at the University of Michigan, said the tsunami may have been caused by a partial collapse of Anak Krakatau. 
“Instability of the slope of an active volcano can create a rock slide that moves a large volume of water, creating local tsunami waves that can be very powerful. This is like suddenly dropping a bag of sand in a tub filled with water,” he said. 
The eruption of Krakatau, previously known as Krakatoa, in 1883 killed more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunamis. 
Anak Krakatau, which means child of Krakatau, is the island that emerged from the area once occupied by Krakatau, which was destroyed in 1883. It first appeared in 1927 and has been growing ever since.

Gaurav Saran,"For anyone who has worked as a customer service agent, it will come as no surprise that returns are one of retailers' biggest nightmares. Haven't worked in retail? The internet is rife with stories you can read to glean a taste of what this hell is actually like. Related: Holiday Returns Scammers to Cost Retailers Billions For example, one agent shared a story on ihateretail about a customer who spent $17,000 in one day. The following day, that customer came back with a note from her therapist that claimed she was a shopping addict and needed to return the items! The National Retail Federaation has estimated that every year, retailers are hit with $70 billion in returns. With around 9 percent of all purchased items being returned, retail businesses need a streamlined procedure in place that is quick and convenient both for consumers, as well as for employees. Dealing with a return is not ideal for the customer retailer; however, returns can be a prime opportunity to demonstrate a high level of customer service and efficiency, if executed correctly. So, it's important to have a tried and tested system in place for before and after the Christmas period to ensure that potential tsunami of returns does not have a negative effect on anyone involved, meaning consumers and employees alike. So what does that look like (for this year or maybe even next year)? Here are some tips for dealing with the onslaught: 1. Leave yourself plenty of time. By the end of January, it's likely that most of your staff will know your company's return policies inside out. However, this would be a case of too little too late. It is important to undertake, at every level of your organization, effective returns-training in the months running up to the holiday season. Everyone from the CEO to the cashier needs to be well acquainted with the policy, so that there are no misunderstandings, and so all stakeholders provide the most accurate information and best service possible to customers. HR staff or managers who are running training sessions and role plays should ensure that staff are well versed with processes, technology and the art of dealing with challenging customer service scenarios -- before the post-Christmas craziness arrives. Related: 5 Common Ecommerce Returns Mistakes 2. Have a tried and tested technological solution in place beforehand. By adopting a process that can be automated as much as possible, you remove the burden from your staff, while making the overall process much smoother. This is especially true for businesses that operate multi-channel returns, in which goods can be ordered online and returned in store, and vice versa. According to a recent study from UPS, 62 percent of shoppers surveyed said they were more likely to shop online if they can return those items in-store, and 70 percent who return items in-store said they were more likely to make an additional purchase when at the store,. However, to appeal to these shoppers, it's essential to have a smooth system in place, one in which online and in-store inventories are connected in the same database, so that employees can easily check whether an item is covered by a returns policy and offers on-the-spot credit or cash back. It is also wise to implement a software platform that provides an online support portal for returns, to reduce the workload and strain of customer support staff, while providing a simple, automated solution for clients. Various retail giants, such as Amazon, have integrated such a platform into their returns process. 3. Have a disposition-returns system in place. Ensure that a plan is in place to deal with the disposition of returns. Though many customers may assume their returns are simply placed back on the shelf, this is actually far from the truth. Many items end up as donations, or are repaired and resold to third parties, recycled or simply disposed of depending on the nature of the product. Another option is to work with a third-party dispositions service. Companies such as Liquidity Services, which dubs itself as ""the world's largest marketplace for business surplus,"" purchase stock with the intention of turning it into value again. According to the company, 50,000 items move through its 10,000-square-metre warehouse every two to four weeks, resulting in between 600,000 and 1.3 million products per year, all coming from a major retailer. Liquidity Services sorts, catalogues and, when needed, refurbishes the returns and then turns around and sells them with heavily discounted wholesale prices. Occasionally, revenue can be returned to the retailer after Liquidity Services takes its commission. However, for retailers who would prefer to keep dispositions in house, it is best to establish an automated system which can identify the best course of action for each returned item, limiting the time items spend in stockrooms, and thus maximizing the chances of financial returns from used goods. 4. Have a ""returns zone"" ready before the holidays. Considering that these final days of December include several holiday (off from work) days, it is important to have everything in place for the January returns spike before people leave to celebrate with their families. Another tale to put this into context? According to Buzzfeed, one returns agent told how, when she worked in a supermarket, a woman returned a disposable barbecue because, ""It's just got lumps of black stuff in it."" Said the ex-supermarket worker: ""She had seen the picture on the front of the box that showed burgers and sausages on it and assumed they came with the barbecue."" Imagine the strain on a small business if it doesn't think ahead about how to handle customers like that. Then there's the space issue: Though many companies might be able to deal with a steady flow of returned goods throughout the year, the festive period can prove especially stressful when companies face a larger-than-usual glut of returned items, with very little space to store them. Leaders within the retail industry understand the need to think ahead on this one: Back in 1991, the Los Angeles Times reported on a 6,000-square-foot Nordstrom warehouse in Anaheim, Calif. reserved exculsively for Christmas period return items. Your own company might not need a 6,000-square-foot warehouse, but it is important to ensure adequate space is reserved in stock rooms, or storage spaces, to process and store high volumes or returns in the first weeks ofJanuary. 5. Make sure everyone knows his or her role Returning to work in the new year, after a week of over-indulgence and family fun, is tough enough as it is, without walking into a store or warehouse which resembles a disaster movie. In preparation for the high influx of returns that will arrive as early as staff do, managers should clearly assign roles in advance, so that everyone knows what part he or she needs to play straight off the starting line. Many retailers choose to bring on extra seasonal staff to tide their staff over until the end of January. To maximize productivity for returns, it's smart to roll out a system that's similar to an assembly line, with a clear order and structure. Finally, it is extremely important to reinforce to employees the fact that just because the post-holiday rush will be busy and stressful doesn't mean that customer service isn't still to be maintained at the highest level. Christmas returns are traditionally linked with frustrating customer-service interactions such as lost receipts. Employees should deal with customers in a polite and understanding manner, even if those customers are misinformed or lack the correct evidence of purchase. Related: The Secret to Long-Term Customer Loyalty Is an Easy Return Policy Overall, the festive season may be a very profitable time of year for retailers, but January may be bittersweet. Yet if retailers take the time to prepare their returns processes, employees, technological systems and workspaces, they can start the year off illustrating how they intend to behave all year long: providing great service.","Staffers need to be well versed with processes, technology and customer service challenges, before the post-Christmas craziness arrives.",2017-12-22T18:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",5 Ways Retailers Can Prepare for the Post-Christmas Tsunami (as in Holiday Returns),https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/306535,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20151106175910-call-center-girl-customer-service-.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,tsunami,1
Reuters Editorial,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Rescue teams in Indonesia struggled on Sunday to reach communities feared devastated by a major earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi island, with a toll of more than 400 killed expected to rise sharply as contact is restored with remote areas. Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of two hotels and a mall in the city of Palu, which was hit by waves as high as six meters (20 feet) following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday. A young woman was pulled alive from the rubble of the Roa Roa Hotel, the news website Detik.com reported. Hotel owner Ko Jefry told Metro TV on Saturday that up to 60 people were believed trapped. Hundreds of people gathered at the mall searching for loved ones. “We’ve got information from people that their relatives are still inside, so we’re focusing on that, especially to find survivors,” a rescuer identified as Yusuf, working at the ruins of the mall, told Metro TV. Graphic: Sulawesi map - tmsnrt.rs/2OYa4YD With confirmed deaths only from Palu, authorities are bracing for much worse as reports filter in from outlying areas, in particular, Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and closer to the epicenter of the quake. Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the toll could rise into the thousands. A disaster official said the tsunami traveled across the sea at speeds of 800 kph (500 mph) before striking the shore and casualties could have been caused along a 300 km (200 miles) stretch of coast, north and south of Palu. Donggala town has been extensively damaged, with houses swept into the sea and bodies trapped in debris, according to a Metro TV reporter on the scene. The Red Cross said it had heard nothing from the Donggala region. “This is extremely worrying,” it said in a statement. “This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.” National search and rescue agency chief Muhammad Syaugi told Reuters rescuers were flying to Donggala by helicopter. QUESTIONS ABOUT WARNINGS Indonesia is all too familiar with deadly earthquakes and tsunamis. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean, killing 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up around the country after that disaster appear to have failed on Friday. The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the Friday quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had withdrawn it too quickly. But officials said they estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force. Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on Palu’s beach when the water smashed onshore at dusk. Palu is at the head of a narrow bay, about 10 km long and 2 km wide, which had “amplified” the force of the wave as it was funneled toward the city, a geophysics agency official said. Questions have been raised about what caused the tsunami, with speculation an underwater landslide was to blame. The BMKG said its closest sensor, about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu, had only recorded an “insignificant”, six-cm (2.5 inches) wave, while researchers said it was surprising the quake, which was recorded as a “strike-slip” event, when tectonic plates move horizontally against each other rather than vertically, had generated a tsunami. “It may be that the shock of the quake triggered a landslide underwater, but we don’t have any proof yet,” Abdul Muhari, who heads a tsunami research team that advises the government, told Reuters. Video footage on social media showed a man on the upper floor of a building shouting warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below moments before the wave crashed ashore. Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage. The Head of the National Disaster Management Agency, Willem Rampangilei, told reporters in Sulawesi late on Saturday rescuers were struggling in their hunt for more victims. “We are having difficulty deploying heavy equipment... because many of the roads leading to Palu city are damaged,” he was quoted by the Kompas newspaper as saying. About 10,000 displaced people were scattered at 50 different places in Palu, he said. Dozens of injured people were being treated in tents set up in the open. ‘HORRIFYING’ Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies lined up on a street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered by clothes. President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers on Sunday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Indonesia had not asked for help but he had contacted President Widodo overnight to offer support and deep sympathies. “It is horrifying... If he needs our help, he’ll have it,” he told ABC TV’s Insiders program. The military has started sending in aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said. Palu’s airport was damaged in the quake, but had reopened for limited commercial flights, authorities said. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In August, a series of quakes killed more than 500 people on the tourist island of Lombok, hundreds of kilometers southwest of Sulawesi.

Reuters Editorial,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - More than 400 people were confirmed killed, many swept away as tsunami waves triggered by a massive earthquake crashed into the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, and authorities expected the toll to rise sharply on Sunday as news arrives from remote areas. Dozens of people were reported to be still trapped in the rubble of a hotel and a mall in the city of Palu, which was hit by waves as high as six meters (20 feet) following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Graphic: Sulawesi map - tmsnrt.rs/2OYa4YD With the death toll so far from Palu alone and reports only slowly filtering in from Donggal, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and closer to the epicenter, authorities are bracing for worse to come. Indonesia’s Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the toll could rise to thousands. Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the Palu’s beach when the wall of water smashed onshore at dusk on Friday, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in its path. Indonesian President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in the city on Sunday. The Head of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), Willem Rampangilei, told reporters in Sulawesi late on Saturday the death toll from Palu had reached 420 people, according to news website Kompas. “It’s estimated that 10,000 refugees are scattered in 50 points in Palu city,” he was quoted by Kompas as saying. “We are having difficulty deploying heavy equipment to find victims under the rubble of buildings because many of the roads leading to Palu city are damaged.” Amateur footage shown by local TV stations showed waves crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors. Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies being lined up along the street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered with clothes. TOLL SEEN RISING BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta the damage was “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed. A bridge was washed away and the main highway to Palu was cut off due to a landslide. “The tsunami didn’t come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (500 mph) before striking the shoreline. Metro TV reported hundreds of people had gathered outside a collapsed mall on Sunday, looking for relatives feared trapped under rubble. Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline for 300 km (200 miles) north and south of Palu, including the region of Donggala. The Red Cross said staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas. “We’re now getting limited communications about the destruction in Palu city, but we have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying. There are more than 300,000 people living there,” Red Cross said in a statement. “This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.” Donggala’s waterfront and port was extensively damaged, with houses swept into the sea and bodies trapped in the rubble, according to a Metro TV reporter on the scene. Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Indonesia had not yet asked for help but he contacted President Joko Widodo overnight to offer support and deep sympathies. “It is horrifying,” he told ABC TV’s Insiders program on Sunday. “To secure the scene and make sure that issues do not deteriorate further, I think, will be a big challenge,” he said. “But I know that President Widodo will be taking a very direct and close interest in how these issues are managed and if he needs our help, he’ll have it.” PRISON BREAK More than half of the 560 inmates in Palu’s prison escaped after its walls collapsed during Friday’s quake, according to state news agency Antara. “It was very hard for the guards to stop the inmates from running away as they were so panicked and had to save themselves too,” Antara quoted warden Adhi Yan Ricoh as saying. Over a hundred inmates staged a separate escape from a prison in Donggala. Prison warden Saifuddin told Kompas inmates had started a fire in the detention center after authorities refused their demands to be released to check on their families. In Palu’s Roa-Roa Hotel, which was completely flattened by the quake, many people were still missing. “Communication is cut off. All we knew is that 24 guests were successfully evacuated and one has died,” hotel owner Ko Jefry told Metro TV on Saturday night. “It is estimated that 50 to 60 people remain trapped.” Amateur video footage showed trees, buildings and a communications tower being swept through a rural landscape. The landslide was caused by liquification of the soil, according BNPB’s Nugroho. In other footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below. Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars. Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage. Indonesia’s meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after Friday’s quake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. The agency was widely criticized for withdrawing the warning too quickly, though officials said they estimated the waves had come within the time the warning was in force. The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly needed food and other basic necessities. Palu’s airport was damaged in the quake, but was reopened for limited commercial flights on Sunday, authorities said. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes, including the devastating Boxing Day 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 120,000 in northern Aceh province alone. In August, a series of major quakes killed more than 500 people in the tourist island of Lombok and destroyed dozens of villages along its northern coast. Palu was hit by tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to BNPB.

,"A magnitude 7.5 earthquake rocked Indonesias Sulawesi island, near the city of Palu, on Friday. The quake triggered a 20-foot-tall tsunami that swept across Palu and the surrounding area. The death toll has climbed past 800, but authorities say they fear it could grow, as the desperate search for survivors continues. One survivor told reporters: ""The ground rose up like a spine and suddenly fell."" Officials said hundreds could still be buried in the mud and debris. Several towns remain cut off because roads and bridges were damaged or destroyed, hindering rescue and recovery efforts.

""We have to do many things soon, but conditions do not allow us to do so."" Jokowi also said there are also shortages of fuel, electricity and food. The quake and tsunami were the latest natural disasters to hit Indonesia, which is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.

Zahra Matarani,"CARITA, Indonesia (Reuters) - It was a solemn Christmas for the congregation in Indonesia’s Carita, a seaside town left reeling from the tsunami that has killed over 400 people and devastated the western coast of Java, as many churchgoers have fled the area for fear of further disasters. 
Instead of holding festivities and exchanging presents, Pastor Rusman Anita Sitorus led a tearful vigil at a mass in her small church. 
“We were planning on holding a Christmas celebration every year, but this year is different due to the tsunami,” Sitorus said, as churchgoers lit candles and cried while praying. 
The occurrence of the disaster during the Christmas season evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. 
Thick ash clouds continued to spew from nearby Anak Krakatau, a volcanic island where a crater collapse on Saturday sent waves smashing into coastal areas on both sides of the Sunda Strait between the islands of Sumatra and Java. 
At least 429 people were killed and more than 1,400 injured, and 154 people remain missing. 
Thousands of residents have had to move to higher ground, and officials have extended their high-tide warning to Wednesday. 
Sitorus said the congregation was much smaller than usual. But residents like Nikson Sihombing, now staying in a temporary evacuation centre, attended. 
“We usually celebrate with joy and festivities, but with the tsunami, we can only pray humbly and not celebrate much for this year’s Christmas,” he said. 
Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population and is also home to sizeable Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities.

Alix Langone,"AccuWeather says it was not responsible for Tuesday morning’s mistaken Tsumani warning push notifications. The company, which provides commercial weather forecasting services around the world, blamed the National Weather Service in a statement, saying that this is not the first time the NWS has mistakenly used actual warning codes in test alerts that ultimately resulted in real warnings being sent out. Meanwhile, the NWS is blaming “one private sector company” that it says sent out the routine test message as an official tsunami warning. It did not mention AccuWeather by name. Barry Meyers, AccuWeather’s CEO, advised the NWS to change the way it issues test alert three years ago, the company said. “We understand the reason for test messages, but we feel that NWS consider fail safe measures for the future to prevent such an occurrence. The issuance did say it was a “TSUNAMI WARNING,” but it was not a tsunami warning, rather simply a test of the system,” he wrote. “We note that the method currently used of relying on the “TEST” in the header of the product and a test in the VTEC status, as the identifying device for software coding in numerous programs and systems used by a plethora of companies to identify such messages, has proven to be a less than perfect system.” AccuWeather said in a statement that it uses “sophisticated algorithms” to scan all of the codes the NWS sends out, and that the mistake happened not because of a computer error on their end, but because the NWS embedded the wrong code in its original message.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia is in a race against time to save victims of a devastating earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi island, the government said on Tuesday, as the official death toll rose to more than 1,200 and looting fueled fears of lawlessness. Four days after the double disaster struck, officials feared the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead had come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Some remote areas have been largely cut off after Friday’s 7.5 magnitude quake triggered tsunami waves, destroying roads and bridges, and their losses have yet to be determined. “The team is racing against time because it’s already D+four,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of National Disaster Mitigation Agency, told a briefing in Jakarta, referring to four days since the quake. He said rescuers had reached all four of the badly affected districts, which together have a population of 1.4 million, but he declined to give an estimate of casualties. He gave few details of the conditions rescuers had found, saying they were similar to those in Palu. Earlier, President Joko Widodo called for reinforcements in the search for survivors saying everyone had to be found. The official death toll surged to 1,234 with 800 people seriously injured. There has been particular concern about Donggala, a district of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, which only a few aid workers have managed to reach. Nugroho said it had been “devastated” by the tsunami. A video from the district, broadcast by the Antara state news agency, showed widespread destruction, including flattened buildings and a ship hurled into port buildings by the tsunami. “What we need is food, water, medicine, but to up now we’ve got nothing,” said an unidentified man standing in ruins. In Palu, tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) smashed into the beachfront, while hotels and shopping malls collapsed in ruins. About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said. Before-and-after satellite pictures showed a largely built-up neighborhood just south of Palu’s airport seemingly wiped clean of all signs of life by liquefaction. Nugroho said Sigi district was “flattened” by liquefaction. Among the dead were 34 children killed at a Christian bible study camp. LEAVING AND LOOTING More than 65,000 homes were damaged and more than 60,000 people have been displaced and are in need of emergency help. Thousands of people have been streaming out of stricken areas. Commercial airlines have struggled to restore operations at Palu’s damaged airport but military aircraft have taken some survivors out. Many more want to leave. The government has ordered that aid be airlifted in but there’s little sign of help on Palu’s shattered streets and survivors appeared increasingly desperate. A Reuters news team saw a shop cleared by about 100 people, shouting, scrambling and fighting each other for items including clothes, toiletries, blankets and water. Many people grabbed diapers while one man clutched a rice cooker as he headed for the door. Non-essential goods were scattered on the floor amid shards of broken glass. Police were at the scene but did not intervene. The government has played down looting saying victims could take essentials and shops would be compensated. Indonesia is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. It has said it would accept offers of international aid, after shunning outside help this year when an earthquake struck Lombok island. A spokesman for the main U.N. aid coordinating agency, OCHA, said humanitarian agencies were in contact with the government and ready to help. “There is an immediate need for food, clean water, shelter, medical care and psycho-social support,” the spokesman, Jens Laerke, told a briefing in Geneva. State port operator Pelindo IV said a ship carrying 50 tonnes of supplies including rice and baby milk had arrived in Palu on Monday. It was unclear if the aid had been distributed. ‘BURIED FAST’ Power has yet to be restored and aftershocks have rattled nerves but rescuers in Palu held out hope they could still save lives. “We suspect there are still some survivors trapped inside,” the head of one rescue team, Agus Haryono, told Reuters at the collapsed Hotel Roa Roa as he pored over its blueprints. About 50 people were believed to have been caught inside the hotel when it was brought down. About nine bodies have been recovered and three rescued alive. Elsewhere, on the outskirts of Palu, lorries brought 54 bodies to a mass grave. Most had not been claimed, a policeman said, but some relatives came to pay respects to loved ones at the 50-meter (165 ft) trench. Rosmawati Binti Yahya, 52, was still looking for her missing daughter. But her husband was among the victims laid in the grave. “It’s OK if he’s buried in the mass grave, it’s better to have him buried fast,” she said.

Reuters Editorial,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - At least 30 people were killed in the bay city of Palu in Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, a hospital official told Metro TV on Saturday, after the area was hit by strong earthquakes and a tsunami a day earlier. In a video that appeared to be taken at night, doctor Komang Adi Sujendra said 30 people were killed and had been taken to the hospital where he was, adding that another 12 injured needed orthopedic surgery. Authorities were having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts as the 7.5 magnitude quake caused a power outage that cut communications around Palu and the nearby fishing town of Donggala, the closest to the epicentre of the quake 27 km (17 miles) away. Officials had not yet provided any new information on the death toll on Saturday, but on Friday night they said initial reports showed some dead victims in the rubble of collapsing buildings.

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo ordered more rescuers to hunt for victims of a devastating earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, saying on Tuesday everyone had to be found, as the scale of destruction became clearer. Some remote areas have been out of contact for more than three days and officials fear the confirmed death toll of 844 could soar into the thousands when losses in those areas are revealed. “The are some main priorities that we must tackle and the first is to evacuate, find and save victims who’ve not yet been found,” Widodo told a government meeting to coordinate disaster recovery efforts. He said he had ordered the national search and rescue agency to send more police and soldiers into the affected districts, some cut off since Friday’s 7.5 magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami waves destroyed roads, triggered landslides and downed bridges. The Red Cross said the situation was “nightmarish” and reports from its workers venturing into one cut-off area, Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter, indicated it had been hit “extremely hard”. Four badly hit districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. Most of the confirmed dead have been in the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. The quake triggered tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) that smashed into the city’s beachfront, while hotels and shopping malls collapsed in ruins and some neighborhoods were swallowed up by ground liquefaction. Among those killed in the area were 34 children at a Christian bible study camp, a Red Cross official said. More than 50 of the dead were taken to a mass grave on the outskirts of Palu on Tuesday, while rescuers held out hope they could still save lives. “We suspect there are still some survivors trapped inside,” the head of one rescue team, Agus Haryono, told Reuters at the collapsed seven-storey Hotel Roa Roa. About 50 people were believed to have been caught inside the hotel when it was brought down. About 12 people have been recovered from the ruins, with one more body on Tuesday. Three of the victims were recovered alive. Haryono pored over the hotel’s blueprints and building plans, searching for possible pockets and a way through to them. A faint smell of decomposition hung in the air. “We have to be very careful so we don’t risk hurting any survivors when we move the debris,” he said. Power has yet to be restored in the area and access by land to outlying villages has been disrupted by broken roads, landslides and downed bridges. Nearly 60,000 people have been displaced and are in need of emergency help, while thousands have been streaming out of stricken areas. ‘BURIED FAST’ Indonesia has said it would accept offers of international aid, having shunned outside help earlier this year when an earthquake struck the island of Lombok. Aftershocks have rattled jangled nerves. A particular horror in several areas in and around Palu was liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid. About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up, with hundreds of people believed buried, the national disaster agency said. Before-and-after satellite pictures show a largely built-up neighborhood just south of Palu’s airport seemingly wiped clean of all signs of life by liquefaction. Elsewhere on the outskirts of Palu, trucks brought 54 bodies to a mass grave dug in sandy soil. Most of the bodies had not been claimed, a policeman said, but some relatives turned up to pay respects to loved ones at the 50 meter (165 feet) trench, where the smell of decomposition was overpowering. “It’s OK if he’s buried in the mass grave, it’s better to have him buried fast,” said Rosmawati Binti Yahya, 52, whose husband was among those placed in the grave, before heading off to look for her missing daughter. Commercial airlines have struggled to restore operations at Palu’s quake-damaged airport but military aircraft took some survivors out on Monday, while about 3,000 people thronged the airport hoping for any flight out. A navy vessel capable of taking 1,000 people at a time was due to be deployed to help with the evacuation. The power company was working to restore electricity while the state oil firm had sent in fuel, officials said. Teams of police were out on the streets on Tuesday, clearing debris and providing some reassurance to traumatized residents worried about looting.

Rosie Perper,"The full scope of devastation in the city of Palu in indonesia is becoming clearer, days after an earthquake and tsunami hit the region. Scores of people are thought to still be trapped in the rubble on the island of Sulawesi, which was hit by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake and a subsequent tsunami with waves reaching as high as 20 feet. Citing government officials, local media said at least 1,200 people were killed NPR reported on Monday. Other estimates put the death toll around 844. Officials have warned the number of casualties could rise as rescuers clear debris scattered by massive waves. Downed power lines have left parts of the city in darkness. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management, posted video showing the moment the tsunami battered the island's coast on Friday. Nugroho also posted video of the moment when the earthquake hit the area earlier on Friday. People can be seen fleeing as buildings around them collapse. He said at the time that victims could still trapped in the surrounding area, adding that Palu's Petobo neighborhood was devastated, and said there were still ""hundreds of victims buried in mud."" ABC News confirmed that some victims were found ""entombed"" in mud, most of the casualties were caused by the quake and the tsunami, though hundreds of others were buried alive under soil that had loosened and collapsed after the earthquake in a process known as liquefaction. Special rescue teams arrived on Monday to begin digging. Victims buried in mass graves Local and military officials have arranged for a mass burial site in Palu for the overwhelming number of victims. According to Sutopo, officials worry that a delay in burying the victims could create a new health crisis. According to The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, relatives have sifted through body bags searching for their loved ones. Victims in local hospitals have been photographed to help families locate their bodies. The injured lie on the ground as they wait to be transported via the airport in Palu. Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images According to ABC, local army commander Tiopan Aritonang said 545 bodies were to be brought from one hospital alone. The gravesite could be enlarged if necessary, officials added. Across the island, around 50,000 people remained displaced as the main Palu airport was damaged and operating with only one functioning runway as of Tuesday, according to the Guardian. Thousands of people sought refuge at the airport, which forced it to shut down temporarily. Early detection warning systems failed A car sits wedged into a building in Palu. Carl Court/Getty Images Reports indicate that the country's early detection warning systems were not working before the tsunami hit. Officials confirmed to the BBC that a network of more than 20 floating detection units connected to underwater sensors which transmit advance tsunami warnings to the Indonesian meteorology and geophysics agency had either been damaged or stolen. The system had not worked since 2012, and an apparent lack of funding hasn't helped. ""If we look at the funding, it has decreased every year,"" disaster agency spokesperson Sutopo told local media Sunday. A tsunami warning was still issued, but it appeared to significantly underestimated the scale of the impending waves. Indonesia's geophysics agency warned of a tsunami nearly 10 feet tall, but lifted the warning shortly after it was issued. OLA GONDRONK/AFP/Getty Images Many people didn't recieve alerts at all because of non-functioning power lines and a lack of storm sirens along the coast. It is unclear whether the tsunami hit before or after the warning had been lifted. ""If we had a tide gauge or proper data in Palu, of course it would have been better,"" Rahmat Triyono, head of the geophysics agency, said. ""This is something we must evaluate for the future.""","The full scope of devastation in the city of Palu in indonesia is becoming clearer, days after an earthquake and tsunami hit the region.

Alexandra Ma,"Indonesia ordered planes to stay away from the country's airspace after one of its volcanoes partially collapsed, spouting volcanic ash into the atmosphere and triggering a devastating tsunami earlier this week. 
 A crater on the Anak Krakatau island volcano collapsed on Saturday, which caused an underwater landslide and sent waves of up to 16 feet high along coastal regions on the Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra. 
The tsunami claimed at least 430 people's lives.
 FERDI AWED/AFP/Getty Images 
At least 430 people are dead, 1,495 are injured, and 159 are missing, according to Reuters. 
 Because a volcano and not an earthquake caused the disaster, authorities couldn't trigger a tsunami warning at the time. Coastal residents also reported not seeing or feeling warning signs before the tsunami hit on Saturday night.

Indonesia's disaster management agency (BNPB) on Thursday upgraded its alert level for the volcano to its second-highest level, warning in a statement that volcanic activity on the island volcano ""continues to increase."" 
 The volcano is still throwing up hot lava and volcanic ash, the BNPB added. 
 While the ash is not dangerous — and in fact ""actually fertilizes the soil"" — the agency said people should be ""using masks and goggles when moving outside when it rains ash."" 
 The BNPB also extended the danger zone from 2 km (1.2 miles) to 5 km (3 miles) around the island, and said: ""People and tourists are prohibited from carrying out activities within a 5 kilometer radius of the crater peak of Mount Anak Krakatau.""

AirNav Indonesia, the country's traffic control agency, said it was closing flight routes to avoid the volcanic ash. 
 Between 20 and 25 flights were rerouted as of Thursday evening local time, including international routes to and from Australia, Singapore and the Middle East, the BBC reported. 
 The reroutes mean that passengers may experience longer journeys, and planes may require more fuel to power their trips, the BBC added. 
 The next phase of the volcanic eruption will involve incandescent — or extremely hot — lava mainly flowing to the island's southeast.","Indonesian authorities warned of continued eruptions out of its Anak Krakatau volcano, which triggered a devastating tsunami earlier this week.

,"A magnitude 5.3 earthquake was reported Thursday afternoon off the coast of California near Los Angeles. It was the largest earthquake to strike the Channel Islands region since a 6.0 temblor in 1981, Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson told the Los Angeles Times. No significant damage has been reported after a magnitude 5.3 earthquake in the Channel Islands region off the Southern California coast, but some bricks fell from a chimney at a historic ranch on one of the islands, according to the Associated Press. Channel Islands National Park spokeswoman Yvonne Menard told AP that the bricks fell Thursday at a ranch building on Santa Cruz Island that dates to the 1860s. Menard says the quake was felt by visitors and staff on the island. The quake's epicenter was 17 miles from Santa Cruz Island, which is largely unpopulated but does have some staff and is visited by campers. Authorities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties did not report any immediate damage. The National Tsunami Warning Center said there is no tsunami threat to the California coast.","The Weather Channel Earthquake Shakes Southern California; No Injuries Reported, But Historic Ranch Damaged in 5.3 Magnitude Tremor The Weather Channel Meteorologist Kait Parker reports that a 5.3 magnitude earthquake was felt off the coast of Southern Califo…",2018-04-05T21:41:21Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Weather.com'}","Earthquake Shakes Southern California; No Injuries Reported, But Historic Ranch Damaged in 5.3 Magnitude Tremor - The Weather Channel",https://weather.com/news/news/2018-04-05-earthquake-southern-california,https://s.w-x.co/screen_shot_2018-04-05_at_3.42.53_pm.png,,Weather.com,tsunami,1

Balaroa is now a vast wasteland of debris. Rooftops are all that remain of many houses. The minaret of a mosque, leaning precariously to one side, is one of the few structures still standing. Across Palu and in neighboring areas, many people are still unaccounted for. Officials put the number of missing at 113, but that was only those who had been reported. An untold number were swept away by the tsunami, especially by the third and final wave that was more than 20 feet high in some places. And many bodies are thought to still be buried under rubble in places like Balaroa. The quake struck at 6:02 p.m., an hour when many would have been at home.

Melissa Locker,"A massive tsunami hit Indonesia on Saturday. Without any warning, a wall of water flattened communities on its two most populous islands (Sumatra and Java), killed at least 429 people, and injured hundreds more. The disaster comes only a few months after an earthquake and tsunami in September killed over 2,000 people and displaced some 206,000 people on the island of Sulawesi.The tsunami was apparently triggered by underwater landslides caused by the eruption of the Krakatoa volcano in the Sunda Strait that lies between the two hard-hit islands. On Wednesday, Indonesian authorities warned that the continued eruption of Anak Krakatau, or “Child of Krakatau” volcano, could trigger an additional tsunami, according to Singapore’s Straits Times newspaper.
For now, though, relief teams are on the ground aiding authorities to find the missing, clear debris, and provide basic needs, while rescue teams use drones and dogs to help find the more than 100 people who are still missing. If you want to help, experts say sending money is usually the most efficient assistance in a disaster. Here are a few charities working in Indonesia right now:
Catholic Relief Services is supporting both the government and local partner organizations to reach affected families and provide relief and assistance. The group has a 4 out of 4-star rating on Charity Navigator.
Islamic Relief USA has sent a team to survey the damage directly and is on the ground providing aid to survivors, including emergency water, food, and medical aid. It also has a malnutrition project in Indonesia. The group has a 4 out of 4-star rating on Charity Navigator.
Doctors Without Borders has a team on the ground in the affected areas helping to support local healthcare providers in the aftermath of the tsunami, in addition to their long-term work in Pandeglang, Indonesia. The group has a 4 out of 4-star rating on Charity Navigator.
GlobalGiving, which funnels donations to local organizations, has many options for helping in Indonesia, whether specifically for tsunami and earthquake recovery, or for other worthy causes like orangutan rescue or saving slow lorises or saving street kids from a life of poverty. GlobalGiving has a 4 out of 4-star rating on Charity Navigator.
UNICEF USAis on the ground in Indonesia, accompanying authorities as they assess the damage and its impact on children. They are ready to assist children and families, when the government gives them the green light, as per their mandate. The group has a 3 out of 4-star rating on Charity Navigator.
Red Cross volunteers, including those from the local outpost, the Indonesian Red Cross, are helping in the affected area. They are assisting in search and rescue, distributing drinking water, dispatching Red Cross ambulances to transport people to hospitals, and doling out hygiene, cooking, and cleaning supplies to people who have lost or cannot return to their homes. They are also sending helicopters to drop supplies to hard-to-reach communities along the coastlines of western Java and south Sumatra. The American Red Cross has a 3 out of 4-star rating on Charity Navigator.

(Photo: TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA, AFP/Getty Images) TOKYO — They bowed their heads, hands clasped or palms firmly pressed together. They stood in grassy areas or roadsides overlooking the choppy sea. In Japan’s capital, they lit candles and offered flowers. Some dabbed at tears. Japanese marked the seventh anniversary Sunday of a tsunami that took more than 18,000 lives on the northeast coast and triggered a nuclear disaster that turned nearby communities into ghost towns. Residents along the coast gathered outdoors to remember the tragedy as sirens wailed at 2:46 p.m., the moment the magnitude-9.0 offshore earthquake struck on March 11, 2011, setting off a massive tsunami. The tsunami overwhelmed sea walls and washed away buildings, cars and entire neighborhoods as it swept inland. It knocked out power at the seaside Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, causing partial meltdowns in three reactors. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Sunday at an official ceremony in Tokyo that reconstruction is making steady progress, but more than 70,000 people are still displaced and many have no prospect of returning to their homes. Prince Akishino, the second son of Japanese Emperor Akihito, expressed hope that the tsunami would raise awareness and help prevent or mitigate damage from future natural disasters. “It is my earnest hope … that we hand down the knowledge to future generations in order to protect many people from the dangers of disasters,” he said. Separately, several hundred people observed a moment of silence and made offerings at an altar set up in Hibiya Park in central Tokyo. Cleaning up the still-radioactive Fukushima nuclear plant site remains a daunting challenge that is expected to take 30 to 40 years.

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - The extent of the devastation caused by an earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi should become clearer on Tuesday, as rescuers push into remote areas that have been out of contact for more than three days. Officials fear the death toll will rise into the thousands. Indonesia has said it would accept offers of international aid, having shunned outside help earlier this year when an earthquake struck the island of Lombok. The number of confirmed deaths stood at 844 on Tuesday, most of them in Palu, the main city in the disaster zone, where rescuers were hunting for victims in the ruins. “We suspect there are still some survivors trapped inside,” the head of on rescue team, Agus Haryono, told Reuters at the collapsed seven-storey Hotel Roa Roa. About 50 people were believed to have been trapped when the hotel was brought down by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday. The quake triggered tsunami waves as high as six metres (20 feet) that smashed into the city’s beachfront, about 2 km from the hotel. About 12 people have been recovered from the ruins of the hotel, three of them alive. Haryono pored over the hotel’s blueprints and building plans, searching for possible pockets and a way through to them. A faint smell of decomposition hung in the air. “We have to be very careful so we don’t risk hurting any survivors when we move the debris,” he said. Power has yet to be restored in the area and access by land to outlying villages has been disrupted by broken roads, landslides and downed bridges. Aftershocks have rattled jangled nerves. A 5.9 magnitude quake struck earlier on Tuesday near the southern island of Flores, hundreds of kilometres from Sulawesi, the U.S. Geological Survey said. There no immediate reports of casualties or damage. ‘DOUBLE DISASTER’ A particular horror in several areas in and around Palu was liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid. About 1,700 houses in one Palu neighbourhood were swallowed up, with hundreds of people believed buried, the national disaster agency said. There was also mounting concern over Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicentre, and two other districts - with a combined population of about 1.4 million. Initial reports from Red Cross rescuers who had reached the outskirts of Donggala district were chilling. “The situation in the affected areas is nightmarish,” Jan Gelfand, head of an the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) office in Jakarta said in a statement. “The city of Palu has been devastated and first reports out of Donggala indicate that it has also been hit extremely hard by the double disaster,” Gelfand said. Nearly 60,000 people have been displaced and are in need of emergency help, while thousands have been streaming out of the stricken areas. Chief security minister Wiranto said on Monday the government was trying to meet survivors’ immediate needs and would accept offers of international help. “Right now, we need emergency aid,” Wiranto said, referring to the foreign aid that would be airlifted to Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Commercial airlines have struggled to restore operations at Palu’s quake-damaged airport, but military aircraft took survivors out on Monday. About 3,000 people thronged the airport hoping to get on any flight and officers struggled to keep order. Wiranto said a navy vessel capable of taking 1,000 people at a time would also be deployed to help with the evacuation. He said the power utility was also working to restore electricity: “Without energy, everything is crippled.” Anger and desperation among traumatized residents of Palu appeared to be simmering, with some outbreaks of looting. “Stop hiding Mr Mayor,” was daubed on a wall in one part of Palu. Mayor Hidayat was unavailable for comment.

So that means an end to services that let those controlling large numbers of accounts to batch tweet, follow users, retweet or like tweets. Twitter will continue to allow content to be posted to accounts using software, for example, weather alerts, RSS feed updates and more, but they will now be limited to a single account going forward. “These changes are an important step in ensuring we stay ahead of malicious activity targeting the crucial conversations taking place on Twitter — including elections in the United States and around the world,” Yoel Roth, who heads up API policy and product trust, for Twitter explained in a blog post. There is a small caveat for public service-related information. “As a sole exception to this rule, applications that broadcast or share weather, emergency, or other public service announcements of broad community interest (for example, earthquake or tsunami alerts) are permitted to post this content across multiple accounts who have authorized an app,” Roth wrote. The new measures are a clarification of a crackdown that Twitter first announced in January in response to concerns around how the platform was used in relation to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Overall, it’s a shame. Bots can be great when put to work properly — researchers have come to that very conclusion — but some internet people are inherently bad and bot networks can be used to give them oversized influence and power. For example, Twitter itself has confirmed that there were over 50,000 Russia-linked bots that attempted to interfere with the election. It isn’t exactly clear what size audience those bots reached overall, but it is likely to be some way lower than the Russia-backed election meddling efforts on Facebook, which are said to have reached nearly 150 million of the social network’s users. “Since June 2017, we’ve removed more than 220,000 applications in violation of our rules, collectively responsible for more than 2.2 billion low-quality Tweets,” Twitter said last month. For anyone who has been at the receiving end of bots — whether it be spam or more serious incidents such as harassment — Twitter’s move to restrict what is possible is long overdue. App developers have until March 23 of this year to make the necessary changes to comply with this new policy so we’ll get a chance to see what a difference this makes right after that date. Already there has been some controversy after the social network removed large numbers of suspected bot accounts from its service this week. In doing so, some users’ follower counts were reduced. The numbers seemed to particularly hurt conservative and right-wing opinionated users who cried foul play, as Gizmodo reports. Twitter told Gizmodo that it acted without political bias in response to accounts that it suspected were bots or had violated its policy. Twitter’s tools are apolitical, and we enforce our rules without political bias. As part of our ongoing work in safety, we identify suspicious account behaviors that indicate automated activity or violations of our policies around having multiple accounts, or abuse. We also take action on any accounts we find that violate our terms of service, including asking account owners to confirm a phone number so we can confirm a human is behind it. That’s why some people may be experiencing suspensions or locks. This is part of our ongoing, comprehensive efforts to make Twitter safer and healthier for everyone. Hold on to that popcorn, more drama to come soon.

Rosie Perper,"Officials fear at least 5,000 people may still be missing in Indonesia following a deadly earthquake and tsunami that killed 1,763 people and devastated the northern island of Sulawesi. Officials updated the number of casualties on Sunday. The country's disaster agency announced the search for survivors would end Thursday, despite fears that scores of people still remain buried under heaps of rubble and mud. Thousands of those still missing are thought to be from the towns of Baleroa and Petobo, which was swept away following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami last month, leaving mass destruction in its wake. Officials are reportedly considering declaring the area mass graves because of the widespread damage. Officials said it was still unsafe to use heavy machinery in some areas where soil had loosened and collapsed after the earthquake in a process known as liquefaction. Many of the dead were buried in mass graves because of the overwhelming amount of victims. Officials have said they worry that a delay in burying the bodies could create a new health crisis. Families have sifted through body bags searching for their loved ones. Many of the missing are believed to be dead as rescue efforts enter its second and final week. Those not found by Thursday will be presumed dead, disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said. More than 30 bodies were recovered in one place on Saturday. Officials said rescue efforts will now focus on supplying aid and relief to survivors of effected areas. 62,000 people remain displaced, Nugroho said, as aid donations slowly reach those impacted by the disaster. Aid deliveries have slowly trickled in. Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images Reports indicate that the country's early detection warning systems were not working before the tsunami hit. Officials confirmed to the BBC that a network of more than 20 floating detection units connected to underwater sensors which transmit advance tsunami warnings to the Indonesian meteorology and geophysics agency had either been damaged or stolen. The system had not worked since 2012, and an apparent lack of funding hasn't helped. ""If we look at the funding, it has decreased every year,"" disaster agency spokesperson Sutopo told local media Sunday. A tsunami warning was still issued, but it appeared to significantly underestimated the scale of the impending waves. Indonesia's geophysics agency warned of a tsunami nearly 10 feet tall, but lifted the warning shortly after it was issued.","Officials fear at least 5,000 people may still be missing in Indonesia following a deadly earthquake and tsunami which killed 1,763 people and devastated the northern island of Sulawesi.

Julie McCarthy,"The Donggala District Prison was torched by rioting prisoners one day after the double earthquake and tsunami disasters on Sept. 28. Donggala is close to the epicenter of the earthquake, and rattled prisoners wanted a way out. Noele Mage/NPR It's not every day you see freed prisoners walk back into the arms of their jailers. But about 80 inmates from Indonesia's Donggala District Prison are doing just that. They assembled this past week on the patchy grass of the prison grounds and counted off for prison head Safiuddin. The diminutive warden's powers of persuasion worked for this group, but not for all of the 360 prisoners who had been serving time in the old jailhouse when an earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia on Sept. 28. Donggala lies close to the epicenter of the earthquake, where the shaking was the most violent. Rattled prisoners rioted to get out. The disasters killed more than 2,000 people across the country. Thousands more are believe to be missing, and the government says it will halt its search for any more victims starting Thursday. The true death toll may never be known. Warden Safiuddin says that as tensions escalated inside the prison, he pleaded for patience but was met by a ""band of inmates"" who ""could not be controlled."" First, one cellblock was torched. Then prisoners set fire to the football field out back. After that, they returned to the prison again to burn another cellblock. ""Some were wearing ninja masks and shouting to attack the prison officers,"" Safiuddin says. The inmates devolved into ""anarchy,"" he adds. He decided to throw open the doors and let them out, rather than risk ""all sorts of casualties."" ""It was a tough decision,"" Safiuddin says one he made out of concern for the safety of his officers whose lives were under threat. Safiuddin acknowledges the escapees were animated mostly out of worry for their families, and rumors. Word had spread that inmates at other prisons had already been released to check on their loved ones. On Sept. 30, the day after the fire, Safiuddin addressed an emotional gathering of about 260 prisoners who had stayed. ""I cried, the prisoners cried,"" he recalls. He excoriated them, saying, ""We are all in trouble now."" The rioting and burning had made the prison uninhabitable. He told them they were all free to go and visit their families, on the condition they come back and regularly report on their status. About a quarter of the prisoners check back every other day, as they await assignment to another prison. On this day, Safiuddin asks these self-reporting inmates, ""Are you ready to be transferred?"" The inmates shout back: ""Ready!"" The warden is part preacher, part tough-love coach. ""Encourage your fellow inmates to turn themselves in,"" he says. ""Serve your sentence, and live out your life without worry,"" he exhorts. The Donggala High Court Judge is on hand with a sterner message to the inmates: ""Don't think if you run, you can hide,"" he warns. Donggala is a medium-security prison. There are no murderers or rapists. In fact, there are no felons at all. These morning assemblies are studies in casualness, with prison guards standing around swapping cigarettes with the returning inmates who have been convicted of minor offenses. Small-time corruption is a common one. Mohammad Taris, 49, was convicted of corruption. As a village chieftain, he falsified receipts for item such as chairs and kindergarten toys, but now says he's determined to ""obey the law, and with a clear conscience and without pressure from anyone."" He plans to report back to the prison even though he's free. Noele Mage/NPR Mohammad Taris, a stocky 49-year-old with a quick smile, was the village chief when he falsified receipts for things such as ""chairs and kindergarten toys."" Mohammad says he has checked in with his grown sons, and is determined to serve out the remaining seven months of his sentence. Given the chance for freedom, most people would take it and never look back. Not Mohammad. ""I want to obey the law. Obey the law,"" he repeats for effect. ""With a clear conscience, and without pressure from anyone, I will report here."" Prisoner Arifudin, 49, said he dutifully reports back in because ""it was better to fully serve"" his sentence. He has one month left on his prison sentence for underage marriage. A female self-reporting prisoner, Lili Setioningsih, was convicted of stealing from the school where she worked. The 37-year old mother says that a sea of mud carried her house away in the district of Sigi. Her children have been moved to her parents' home, far away. She's appealed to the warden to ease her ""trauma."" She wants him to ""find a prison where I can serve out my time closer to my children. It's all up to him,"" she says. The warden, who is listening to our conversation, leans in and quietly assures her: ""It will be done."" Perhaps a fresh start in the making, from the ruins of Indonesia's twin disasters.","Prisoners at the Donggala District Prison rioted as the earthquake and tsunami hit last month.

Robinson Meyer,"Seventy-six people are dead. At least 1,276 are missing. And more than 7 million have been confined to their homes, as a cloud of toxic, corrosive ash darkens their windows and creeps under their doors. The Camp Fire—which is still burning across some 232 square miles of Northern California—now ranks among the worst natural disasters to hit the United States this century. Only a handful of hurricanes and a “super outbreak” of tornadoes in 2011 have killed more Americans. This fire has robbed more Californians of their lives than has any earthquake since 1933. It came like an ocean of flame. At 6:33 a.m. on Thursday, November 8, someone called 911 about a fire in the woods on Camp Creek Road. (The road would lend the fire its bitterly ironic name.) When firefighters arrive 10 minutes later, they noted the parched conditions and the harsh, hot wind. “This has got the potential for a major incident,” one says over the radio. For the next 24 hours, the Camp Fire devoured roughly a football field of forest every second. By 11 a.m., it grew to 1,000 acres. By noon, its ash cloud blocked out the sun. By 1 p.m., that plume was visible from space, a gray blot smearing across the green of California. That morning, the 26,000 residents of Paradise began to evacuate. But the fire moved too fast. It consumed homes before their occupants could flee and devoured cars while they sat on the road out of town. Later, authorities revealed that in the pandemonium, bulldozers cleared torched cars off the highway so that the cars behind them could escape. Within hours, Paradise was gone. When Californians woke up on Friday, November 9 th, they learned that the Camp Fire had devoured 70,000 acres of land. Now, nine days later, it flickers across some 149,000 acres, and it is only 55 percent contained. There is no disaster like a wildfire. Earthquakes can strike at any time, but they only last for a few moments. Hurricanes might rage for days, but they can be forecast ahead of time. Fire might most closely resemble a tsunami—it arrives like an ocean you can’t outrun—except that fires also choke every city downwind with poisonous billows of ash. Earlier this week, Park Williams, a professor at Columbia, recalled the first time he saw the 100-foot wall of flame that serves as a wildfire’s herald. “It looked like a skyline of buildings,” he told me. “The fire, to me—it’s like an ocean. It’s so strong that we don’t really stand a chance of doing much to it.” It has come to resemble an ocean in its scale, too. The Camp Fire’s smoky air now envelops millions of people, from the state’s desert-like south to its evergreen-crowned north. The ash fills the state’s Central Valley like water in a bathtub —with the Golden Gate as the main plug where it can all rush out. And perhaps the worst aspect here is: This will all happen again. The science on climate change and wildfires is clear—much, much clearer than on many other topics, including hurricanes. Scientists know that scorching-hot summers dry out the needles and twigs on the forest floor, turning them into a tinderbox. They know that climate change has doubled the area that forest fires have burned since 1984. They know that a century of putting out fires—in forests that are evolved to burn regularly—has crammed the timberlands full of burnable fuel. And finally, scientists know that California’s tendency to lurch from a big dry year to a big wet year is intensifying, its “feast and famine” cycle getting more pronounced. They know this will make fires worse, Williams told me: It will allow more plant matter to grow during the wet years; which, during the dry years, will dry out and die and become fire fuel. Seventy-six people, trapped in their homes, fleeing in their cars, now lost forever. And the science is clear: Far more than on hurricanes, far more than on droughts, humanity played a role in this. Through the negligence of spewing carbon into the air, and through the hubris of trying to suppress fires. We have toyed with fire, thinking it in our tool. But the Camp Fire should remind us that we are its plaything.","The Camp Fire now ranks among this century’s worst U.S. natural disasters, and the number of dead could still rise.",2018-11-18T14:51:56Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",A Deadly Tsunami of Fire,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/california-fire-76-are-dead-1276-missing-us-catastrophe/576130/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/11/RTS257IJ/facebook.jpg?1542524072,,Theatlantic.com,tsunami,1
JEFFREY A. LIEBERMAN,"Photo Credit Illustration by Delcan &amp; Company; Pool photo by Ron Sachs As a past president of the American Psychiatric Association, I feel strongly that my fellow psychiatrists, and any psychologists or therapists, should stop speculating publicly about President Trump’s mental fitness and stop trying to diagnose possible mental conditions based on their armchair observations. It’s not that Mr. Trump’s mental fitness should not be evaluated — quite the contrary. All sitting presidents should be evaluated, though most presidential physical exams have included only cursory evaluations of their mental health. When President Trump undergoes his annual medical examination on Friday, his first since taking office, I hope that his assessments include the specific tests that could readily determine if he suffers from a neuropsychiatric condition that could explain his erratic behavior and undermine his ability to perform his duties. But even if these tests are conducted, it is unlikely that we will learn the results. This would be unfortunate, because speculation about Mr. Trump’s mental fitness appears to be reaching its zenith. It is not just the odd behaviors that have become so common: his obsessive tweeting; his shocking, often contradictory statements; and his instances of confusion (for example, not recognizing Rudy Giuliani sitting across from him at a White House meeting or appearing not to remember the words to the national anthem at a sport event). Now we have Michael Wolff’s book, “Fire and Fury,” in which the president’s own staff members question Mr. Trump’s stability and cognitive ability. In response to early accounts of the book, the president tweeted in defense of his mental capacities that “actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.” Yet the reality is that, unless the president is properly evaluated, we have no real evidence to know with certainty if he has a mental disorder. And even if we did, we lack a clear constitutional standard for what severity of impairment would render him unfit to serve. History has shown us that former presidents have suffered conditions hampering their mental function while still in office, including Ronald Reagan, Calvin Coolidge and Woodrow Wilson. Consider the case of Reagan: He was eventually diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, but if he was beginning to show symptoms in his second term, as some believe he was, that did not preclude him from finishing his term. The experiences of those presidents provide convincing evidence that, even if there weren’t a tsunami of speculation about Mr. Trump’s mental condition now, Congress should consider adopting policies to standardize, and to expand as needed, the scope of presidential medical exams to include neuropsychiatric assessments.

The pendulum has swung so far and frequently between the extremes of hopeful and horrific this week that it’s hard to remember everything that happened in between. We’ll help break it down for you. On Monday, things were pretty good: On Tuesday, all eyes were on politics: The Supreme Court voted to uphold Donald Trump’s travel ban, which effectively bars people from Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. Tech executives from Amazon, Google, Apple, and Twitter, among others, met with U.S. security officials to devise a plan for coping with threats to the integrity of the upcoming midterm elections in November. New York, Utah, Oklahoma, Maryland, Colorado, South Carolina, and Mississippi headed to the polls to vote in their primaries. In Oklahoma, where teachers went on strike in protest of low wages and poor benefits in April, 100 teachers appeared on local ballots to try to change the system that necessitated the strikes from within.

The death toll could rise even higher, officials warn, as workers clear debris, rubble and vehicles that were swept away by a massive wave of seawater on Friday. The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck along the coastal district of Donggala on Friday. Most of the dead were found in nearby Palu, a city of nearly 300,000 where an onlooker took a video of the seawater raging ashore just after 5 p.m., local time.

Photos from the region also show people clambering atop a fuel truck, filling up makeshift containers and passing them down to a waiting crowd. Other residents gathered at Palu's port, hoping to get at any supplies arriving by ship. A number of stores were looted, the Post adds.

But the airport has only been operating at partial capacity since it reopened. And as they wait for a chance to fly out, people are also enduring heat of more the 90 degrees, with little to sustain them. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of bodies to deal with, local and military officials arranged for a mass burial site for the victims, according to Indonesian disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, who says officials feared a prolonged delay could create a new health crisis.

Carl Court/Getty Images In addition to travel and communication problems, relief agencies say their response to the latest crisis is somewhat limited by the fact that many staff members remain deployed to Lombok an island hundreds of miles to the south of Sulawesi, where a 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck one month ago. ""Oxfam is provisionally planning a response to reach 100,000 people in Palu city and Donggala district,"" said Ancilla Bere, Oxfam's Humanitarian Manager in Indonesia.

Bere added in a statement emailed to NPR that while access ""remains a big concern with a key road cut off by a landslide and other infrastructure badly damaged,"" she's glad to hear the Indonesian Armed Forces is using military aircraft and helicopters to reach survivors. On Monday, Indonesia's energy agency said it hopes to restore the electricity network within three days. In the meantime, portable generators and other supplies are being sent to the area aboard two C-130 Hercules cargo jets, according to Nugroho. The earthquake hit at 5:02 p.m., quickly triggering a tsunami alert. But about 30 minutes later, Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency canceled the warning, saying the quake was ""not capable of generating a tsunami affecting the Indian Ocean region.""

,"At a Glance A powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia Sunday evening local time. At least 82 people have been killed, the Associated Press reported. The earthquake was centered in a similar spot as a deadly quake one week ago. A powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok on Sunday, killing at least 82 people and shaking neighboring Bali, one week after another quake on Lombok killed more than a dozen. The latest quake, which triggered a brief tsunami warning, damaged buildings as far away as Denpasar on Bali, including a department store and the airport terminal, where ceiling panels were shaken loose, authorities said. Video showed screaming people running in panic from houses in a Bali neighborhood and vehicles rocking. On Lombok, soldiers and other rescuers carried injured people on stretchers and carpets to an evacuation center. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the death toll had risen 82 with hundreds others were injured. Earlier officials said at least 39 people had died. A total of 65 of the deaths were in North Lombok district, nine in West Lombok district, four in the provincial capital Mataram and two each in Central Lombok and East Lombok districts, Nugroho said. Thousands of houses were damaged, and most of the dead victims were hit by collapsed houses, Nugroho said. The quake, recorded at magnitude 6.9 by the U.S. Geological Survey, struck at 6:46 p.m. Sunday evening local time in the northern part of Lombok. Strong aftershocks ranging from 5.4- to 4.3-magnitude followed the main quake, the USGS said. ""I was watching TV when I felt a big shake,"" said Harian, a Lombok woman who uses one name. ""The lamp was shaking, and people were shouting 'Get out.' I ran out into the dark because the power cut off."" A tsunami warning was lifted after waves just 6 inches high were recorded in three villages, said Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency. The quake was felt strongly across Lombok and Bali and had damaged houses on both islands, Nugroho said. Frightened people poured out of their homes to move to higher ground, particularly in North Lombok and Mataram, the capital of West Nusa Tenggara province, said Iwan Asmara, a Lombok disaster official. Indonesian soldiers tend to a woman injured in the earthquake at a makeshift hospital in Lombok, Indonesia, Sunday, Aug. 5, 2018. A strong earthquake struck Indonesia's popular tourist island of Lombok on Sunday, triggering a tsunami warning, one week after another quake in the same area killed more than a dozen people. (AP Photo) The Bali and Lombok airports continued operating Sunday night, according to the director general of civil aviation. There had been a half-hour evacuation at the Lombok airport following the quake because the electricity went off. TV showed crying women consoling each other outside Lombok's airport. The island was already reeling from a magnitude 6.4 quake on July 29, which killed 16 people. Like Bali, Lombok is known for pristine beaches and mountains. Hotels and other buildings in both locations are not allowed to exceed the height of coconut trees. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Landslides have cut off some of the worst-affected areas Tens of thousands of people in Papua New Guinea are in urgent need of supplies after last Monday's powerful earthquake, aid agencies say. Landslides and damaged roads have made it impossible to reach the worst-affected communities in isolated areas. Many people are thought to be living under canvas roofs in the rubble of damaged buildings. The 7.5-magnitude quake rattled villages and a large gold mine in the country's Enga province. US seismologists said it struck 90km (56 miles) south of Porgera at 03:45 local time on Monday (17:45 GMT on Sunday). There have been dozens of aftershocks, including a 5.7 quake on Tuesday afternoon. Local reports say dozens of people have been killed but there has been no official confirmation. ""The challenge is road access; it's still not accessible to trucks and four-wheel drives,"" Udaya Regmi, of the International Red Cross, told Reuters news agency. ""Big trucks cannot go there. It's one of the reasons the food is becoming less and less. There are no fears of starvation yet but we've not got the full picture."" Mr Regmi - who is based in the country - said that 147,000 people were in severe need of food, water and sanitation. A state of emergency has been declared but the full scale of the damage will not be clear until relief workers can complete a full assessment. In a statement, Darian Clark, of the Australian High Commission in Papua New Guinea, described the extent of the damage. ""This was the biggest earthquake in 100 years and it spread 150km across the fault line,"" he said. ""A number of urban settlements, as well as villages, have been affected, many in the form of landslides and landslips, which means that roads have been cut off, water contaminated and power knocked out."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption The 7.5-magnitude quake damaged rural villages The governor of Hela province, Philip Undialu, told local media the damage was ""extensive"". ""Our police station, courthouse, hospital... even private houses have been ripped apart or sunk into the ground,"" Mr Undialu said from the country's capital, Port Moresby. Earthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a hotspot for seismic activity. Part of the country's northern coast was destroyed by a tsunami in 1998, caused by a 7.0 earthquake. Some 2,200 people were killed.","Aid agencies struggle to reach isolated areas in Papua New Guinea, nearly a week after a large quake.",2018-03-04T12:34:26Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Papua New Guinea earthquake: Tens of thousands need urgent aid,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-43277013,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12C4C/production/_100267867_hi045188452.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tsunami,1
Katharine Schwab,"In 2011, a devastating tsunami hit Japan, killing 18,000 people. Many people impacted by the disaster found an unusual way to grieve–an empty telephone booth that a resident placed in his garden in the coastal town of Otsuchi. The booth has a disconnected rotary phone inside. After the tsunami, hundreds have come to “call” their lost loved ones on what’s known as the “wind phone,” sending their love to the dead on the sea breeze. [Image: Ntropic] Now three stories of people who have visited the phone booth to speak with their dead loved ones are part of a new virtual reality experience. Created by the creative studios Ntropic and Yes Please Thank You in partnership with Oculus, the experience Phone of the Wind is a mix between live action footage, animation, and an interactive finale. The project is underwritten by Oculus as content to add to its VR platform, making it an experience that anyone with an Oculus can purchase and watch. With its heart-wrenching subject and mix of storytelling techniques, Phone of the Wind demonstrates VR’s capacity to move us–and perhaps help us come to terms with our own grief. [Image: Ntropic] For Nate Robinson, the founder of Ntropic, the project came at a difficult time. A close friend’s husband had passed away suddenly, and Robinson was feeling the wrench of loss. “It was one of the first times in my life where someone was taken so suddenly without rationale,” he says. “When something happens so suddenly like the tsunami in Japan, it just kicks you in the gut.” To create the VR film, the team working on the project went to Japan to visit the real phone booth. They used a drone to do an aerial opening shot, where the viewer drops down from on high and ends up inside the phone booth. Then, for each story, there’s a short animation telling the story of the relationship between the living and a lost loved one. One story is about a grandmother who brings her two grandchildren to talk to their lost grandfather–this part is live action. But as soon as she picks up the phone, the world is taken over by an illustrated dream, as she relives the memories of their time together. “We want when people watch this to not get depressed, but to celebrate the connections and the memories,” Robinson says. [Image: Ntropic] The final piece is an interactive phone booth, where viewers have a chance to call their own lost loved ones on a virtual rotary phone or write down a note for them. Anyone who visits the virtual booth can see the notes that others have written as well, turning the project into a communal memorial. “We recreated it exactly how it is,” says Andrew Cohen, a CG artist at Ntropic.” It’s not a tourist attraction. It’s a real place where people use this tool for real reasons. To embellish it too much would have felt wrong.” Robinson hopes viewers will be as moved as he is by the story and the experience of the phone booth (which is also beautifully documented in a This American Life e pisode that will leave you in a puddle of tears). The immersive elements –building a real model of a phone booth, complete with a rotary phone, for people to stand inside as they go through the experience–are designed to simply amplify the experience. That way, when it comes time to talk to someone you’ve lost, there’s something real to hold on to.","The phone booth where people go to grieve for loved ones lost in the 2011 tsunami is the centerpiece of a new VR experience.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Press Association Image caption The Belgian probe follows an April report on match-fixing in lower-level tennis matches. Belgium has detained 13 people in a probe into allegations of match-fixing in lower-level professional tennis. Prosecutors said a Belgian-Armenian ring has been bribing players since 2014, with criminals winning bets on the fixed results. Professionals competing in lower-level tournaments were easier to bribe, prosecutors said. The investigation follows a report in April complaining of a ""tsunami"" of corruption in the sport. An Independent Review Panel (IRP) looked into the integrity of professional tennis after a joint Buzzfeed and BBC News investigation found suspected illegal betting. Belgian authorities cooperated with Bulgarian, Dutch, French, German, Slovakian and US counterparts in mounting simultaneous raids on Tuesday. Twenty-one properties in Belgium were searched, with 13 people held on suspicion of match-fixing, corruption, money laundering and participation in organised criminal activities. According to a report in Belgian newspaper Le Soir (in French), the matches in question took place on the International Tennis Federation (ITF) Futures circuit and the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Challenger tour. A judge will decide whether those held will be formally arrested, prosecutors said. In response to the IRP report in April, the governing bodies of professional tennis - the ATP, WTA, ITF and Grand Slam Board - said they recognised ""vulnerabilities"" in the sport, particularly at lower levels. They also said they were ""committed to seizing the opportunity to address these concerns through firm and decisive action"". They are yet to comment on the Belgian raids. Media caption Sports correspondent Joe Wilson explains report into tennis integrity Led by Adam Lewis QC, the IRP found a ""very significant"" corruption problem at ""lower and middle levels of the sport"" which Mr Lewis described as a ""fertile breeding ground for breaches of integrity"". There was no evidence of a cover-up by governing bodies. Men's games accounted for 83% of suspicious match alerts between 2009 to 2017, Mr Lewis said. There was also some evidence of issues at elite events like Grand Slams, but this was not seemingly a ""widespread problem"", the report said.",Prosecutors say a Belgian-Armenian criminal ring has been bribing professional players since 2014.,2018-06-05T10:05:32Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Tennis match-fixing investigators detain 13 in Belgium raids,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44366357,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BBA6/production/_101883084_046410358.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tsunami,1

At least 832 people were killed after an earthquake caused giant waves to smash into the Southeast Asian nation on Friday, and the toll is expected to rise significantly. Heavily populated areas were cut off, and rescuers in the city of Palu, where thousands of buildings collapsed, often used their bare hands to search rubble for survivors. Recriminations begin: Scientists were surprised by the size and power of the tsunami, but critics are starting to question why residents were not given better warning of the coming waves, which reached as high as 18 feet within half an hour of the quake. While 22 monitoring buoys had been spread over Indonesias open water, none had been operational for years, an official said. Hundreds of children per week more than 1,600 so far have been bused to an unregulated camp in the desert, where theres no schooling and limited access to legal aid. To limit escape attempts, the buses leave at night with little warning. Until now, children held by the federal immigration authorities had been housed in private foster homes or shelters, which are regulated and monitored by welfare authorities.

"Associated Press, Associated Press","An Indonesian man is pictured walking inside a damaged room in the Banyumas regional public hospital after a 6.5-magnitude earthquake in Banyumas, Central Java, Indonesia killed at least two people. (Photo: Bayu Nur, EPA-EFE) JAKARTA, Indonesia — A strong earthquake shook Indonesia’s densely populated Java island on Friday night, killing two people and severely damaging dozens of homes near the epicenter. The magnitude-6.5 quake struck at 11:47 p.m. and was felt across the island, including about 200 kilometers (124 miles) away in the capital Jakarta, where office towers and apartment buildings swayed. Powerful tremors lasted as much as 30 seconds in places. Panicking people ran out of buildings in many areas and roads were clogged with motorbikes, cars and trucks as people fled coastal areas in fear of a tsunami. Ahmad Solihin, a food vendor in a coastal area of the Sukabumi region, said his village was jolted by a 20-second tremor that cracked walls in his home. He fled on his motorbike with his wife and two children after neighbors shouted that water was coming, he said. “People suddenly started running so I joined them,” said Solihin. More than 1,000 villagers in his area evacuated to higher ground and didn’t return until Saturday morning after authorities convinced them it was safe, he said. A 62-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman were killed in building collapses, said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. Damage was heaviest in the Tasikmalaya, Pangandaran and Ciamis regions of West Java Province near the epicenter. More than 40 houses collapsed and about 65 suffered severe damage, said Nugroho. The earthquake was about 91 kilometers (56 miles) deep and located just inland, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It triggered a tsunami warning for parts of Java’s coastline that was lifted about two hours later. No significant waves were reported. Several hospitals were damaged by the shaking and patients evacuated. Indonesia sits on the “Pacific Ring of Fire” and has frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

Christian Edwards,"At least 280 people have been killed and more than 1,000 people injured in Indonesia after a tsunami struck coastal areas along the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra on Saturday night, according to the country's National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB). 
Associated Press reports that a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho updated the tool on Monday around midday, local time adding that while only 57 have been officially reported missing, there are fears that number is likely to keep rising. 
 Medecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which has been a running a nascent health project alongside the Ministry of Health in Labuan and Carita in Pandeglang district, one of the areas most severely hit has warned that casualties are likely to move well beyond the current 1,100 injured and missing. 
 Indonesian officials joined MSF is warning of a growing death toll in the wake of an almost silent tsunami swept long both sides of the Sunda Strait coast where western Java and southern Sumatran islands under cover of darkness. 
 A wall of water inundated populated coastlines around 9.30pm local time as resorts and towns welcomed regional holiday makers, leaving scenes of devastation along both coasts. 
 Lightly constructed homes, resorts and and almost all other buildings were toppled and the surrounding areas devastated officials said. 
 Tsunami waves swept along the Sunda Strait coastlines devastating Pandeglang, Serang, South Lampung, and Tanggamus regencies, according to MSF teams on the ground, Monday morning local time. 
 ""All were Indonesian citizens..."" 
Rescuers and residents look for survivors along the coast in South Lampung on South Sumatra on December 23, 2018, after the area was hit by a tsunami on December 22 following an eruption of the Anak Krakatoa volcano. - A volcano-triggered tsunami has left at least 280 dead.

A spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told media that the beaches along Pandeglang were packed with local tourists when the water hit, according to Reuters. 
 ""There are no foreign national casualties, all were Indonesian citizens,"" Nugroho told media. 
The tsunami waves struck in succession along Pandeglang, Serang, South Lampung, and Tanggamus regencies, according to Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams on the ground, Monday morning local time 
 Daniel von Rège, MSF head of mission in Indonesia, said his MSF teams in Pandeglang were trying to attend to injured people and [dead] bodies brought in to MSF health centers on the morning of December 23. 
 ""As the most severe cases were being referred to bigger hospitals in the area and the deceased were being managed by local authorities, MSF supported the exhausted health workers by ensuring proper case management of injured people, infection control and hygiene standards, as well as material support."" 
 ""During the course of the day, more injured people and dead bodies arrived which needed immediate attention—and we expect this to continue over the next few days,"" von Rège said in statement on Monday morning. 
 The nature of this event is yet to be definitively confirmed, although scientists are already pointing to an undersea landslide caused by volcanic activity, which would explain why local media has been told there was no indication that disaster was about to strike 
 ""An undersea landslide resulting from volcanic activity on Anak Krakatau"" - and was likely compounded by very strong high full moon tides, Nugroho said.

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Children in the Indonesian city of Palu began returning to school on Monday to tidy up their classrooms and to help gather data on how many of them will be coming back 10 days after a major earthquake and tsunami hit their city. The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down many buildings in the small city on Sulawesi island, 1,500 km (30 miles) northeast of Jakarta, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront. But the biggest killer was probably soil liquefaction, which happens when a powerful quake turns the ground into a liquid mire and which obliterated several Palu neighborhoods. The official death toll is 1,763 but bodies are still being recovered. No one knows how many people are missing, especially in the areas hit by liquefaction, but it could be as high as 5,000, the national disaster agency said.

Trophies had fallen from a broken school showcase and the basketball court was cracked. “It’s sad to see our school like this,” said Dewi Rahmawati, 17, who expects to graduate next year and wants to study economics at university. The students found out that they had to turn up to school through messages on Facebook and WhatsApp. School principal Kasiludin said authorities told all teachers to show up for work from Monday to collect information on student numbers. “We won’t force the students to come back because many are traumatized.

Most of the dead from the quake and tsunami were in Palu, the region’s main urban center. Figures for more remote areas are trickling in but they seem to have suffered fewer deaths than the city.

Kennedy has been the swing justice for 12 years, since the retirement of [Justice] Sandra Day O’Connor, and in occupying that center role, he moved the court to the right from where it was before. But he didn’t move it always to the right, and he didn’t move it giant steps to the right. And his exceptions happened to be causes that liberals deeply cherish. So Kennedy will be remembered as the champion of gay rights, in a way that’s deeply important to civil rights and to progressives in the country. He also protected the right to abortion in two really important ways. He was part of this compromise with O’Connor and former Justice David Souter in 1992 when he had the vote to either overturn Roe or fundamentally change it. He didn’t. He opted to protect its core, and then in 2016 there was a big case, Whole Woman’s Health, where lots of state restrictions were purporting to protect women’s health, and Kennedy joined the majority in seeing through that and seeing that the notion that closing clinics helps women and protects their health has no factual basis. His other really important progressive set of moves has been in the area of criminal defense, where he helped end the death penalty for people who commit crimes as juveniles and for people who are intellectually disabled. Recently, he’d called into question the constitutionality of prolonged solitary confinement and had importantly ruled against California in a case about their terrible overcrowded prison conditions. So there were these sets of concerns he had that mattered a great deal to the left and made him seem like a kind of—I used the phrase guardian angel when I was writing about this [on Wednesday]. He was a super fickle guardian angel because most of the time he delivered the kinds of fifth votes that we saw this week, where we’re talking about the electoral process, whether to make the vote harder or easier to access—Kennedy sided with the conservatives consistently. There’s just no question that a Trump appointee will be more reliably consistently conservative than Kennedy will be. So yes, Roe v. Wade and the right to abortion [are] on the line. It could change in a couple ways. The court could outright overrule Roe or perhaps more cleverly, and more in the kind of canny style of Chief Justice John Roberts, it could just whittle away at Roe and gut it in a way that maybe would create less of a political backlash. We are in for a real sea change in American law. It’s going to be a roller-coaster ride when this new justice gets appointed. And of course that means we’re going to have a huge fight over this nomination. Plotz: “Roller-coaster ride” implies it goes in more than one direction. This is just going down. This is the down part or the up part, depending on your point of view. Bazelon: Maybe I should say from my point of view, it’s going to be a very rough, rough ride to watch. And to live. Plotz: John, let’s talk a little bit about the political machinations here. Famously, and in probably the most successful political gambit of our lifetimes, Mitch McConnell kept that seat that [Justice] Neil Gorsuch occupies open. He refused to allow any hearings. He refused to allow a Senate vote in 2016 [and] said the elections had to happen. Now there’s an election coming in only [127] days. There were [269] days when [Justice Antonin] Scalia died. There’s no chance that Mitch McConnell is going to delay a vote in this case, is there? Is there anything the Democrats can do to stop or slow or inveigle the appointment of a Supreme Court justice that Donald Trump wants? John Dickerson: I think the short answer for Democrats at the moment is there’s not much they can do. Other than to deny unanimous consent for anything to go forward in the Senate—that’s the burning-the-ships move. The Senate would have to just stop functioning, period. Bazelon: What needs to be done between now and November? Dickerson: I guess what needs to be done is you’ve got [Sens.] Heidi Heitkamp and Jon Tester and Claire McCaskill all running in the states where Democrats think they have a chance to hold those seats, and their electorates are more conservative than they would be, and that electorate would probably not take kindly to shutting down the Senate completely. The benefit you would get from rallying Democrats by taking such a move would, in those redder states—the nine that are red states where Trump won—it probably would backfire on those candidates. Then you’d probably have somebody, like Heitkamp, [who] would bolt, and then the story would be Democratic infighting. Bazelon: Politically, it’s not viable. Dickerson: And also they do want some stuff. Democratic senators in particular, on things like appropriations bills and things like that, do want things. They are a particular of the normal quote-unquote “functioning” of the Senate. Plotz: But also let’s assume they decided to deny unanimous consent, and they were able to delay things such that nothing was able to happen. That presumes that the Senate composition would change enough for the Democrats to control that. They don’t think they’re going to control the Senate in 2019, do they? Dickerson: It’s like a 100-to-1 shot. Because they not only have to hold all their seats, they’d have to then beat [Dean] Heller in Nevada. Bazelon: He looks vulnerable in the polls. Dickerson: Maybe. But you’d have to run the table. And we should note that any Republican who needs to be encouraged to turn out, this is [a] turnout mechanism for Republicans. If it is dealt with before the election, it still is a tidy reminder to Republicans, many of whom voted for Donald Trump only for this reason—that he could name people to the Supreme Court—that he has a shot to name people to the Supreme Court in perhaps two other instances if [Justice] Ruth Bader Ginsberg or Justice [Stephen] Breyer retire. So he’ll need the Senate to confirm that, and they’ll need a majority in the Senate for those years, 2019 and 2020, and so would even further lock in conservative control of the Senate. Republicans will turn out in strong numbers if they follow the behavior that they followed in 2016, where they had doubts about the presidential nominee of their party but they overcame those doubts for the purposes of gaining control of the Supreme Court. That bet paid off for them—it’s paying off quite handsomely. Bazelon: And it would seem to help Republicans either way in the sense that Democrats have already been energized and so now this is the kind of issue that, traditionally, Republicans have been more energized about. Plotz: I guess I’m not sure I necessarily agree with you about that, Emily, in the sense that, I think, if there’s no justice confirmed by Election Day, that’s a huge turnout mechanism for Republicans. And it almost certainly helped them in the election, particularly in redder states in Heidi Heitkamp’s race or in Claire McCaskill’s race. But if there’s a very conservative justice who is put on the court in the next month and is perceived to have been jammed through, yes, Democrats are already motivated, but they can be even more motivated. I think that will surely, surely be helpful. Dickerson: I think that’s right. I don’t know how we’d play this out, but given that it’s likely to go through, how then, if you’re [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer and the Democrats, do you play this politically in a way that kind of allows this to move through the bloodstream? In other words, there isn’t a fight. Bazelon: No, they have to have a fight. Their base will absolutely clobber them if they don’t. I’m not sure about shutting down the Senate. I’m gonna be agnostic about that. But this is the Supreme Court. This is for generations. Plotz: Emily, let’s go back to Kennedy for a little bit. What real, practical difference do you think his retirement makes? Certainly on abortion rights, it’s a huge shift because, undoubtedly, whoever comes in will be much more opposed to abortion rights than Kennedy is. But on the other issues, he’s been very conservative on almost everything else. So is his loss gonna make that much of a difference? Bazelon: Two things: It matters a lot what the reasoning is behind votes—not for the outcome in that particular case, but for what happens next. And Kennedy was mediating, slow, like a simmer. He was not someone who liked to make everything happen rapidly and turn up the water to full boil immediately, in the way that Justice [Antonin] Scalia famously was. He was an incrementalist. And so there are ways in which behind the scenes, he tempered the kinds of rationales that the conservatives used for their 5–4 votes. For example, he did vote to uphold these racially gerrymandered redistricting maps in Texas this week, but Neil Gorsuch and Justice [Clarence] Thomas wanted to argue that the Voting Rights Act doesn’t apply at all in redistricting. That’s a question that was originally settled in 1968. The court has assumed that the Voting Rights Act matters to redistricting for all those 50 years, and there’s a whole body of law. And if the court decides that is no longer the case, that’s a huge seismic shift in law, instead of just a decision against the plaintiffs in this one case that a different majority of the Supreme Court could easily move away from. The second is the abortion part of this. I wonder what you guys think of Jeff Toobin and Elie Mystal, who was saying when I was on the radio with him on Wednesday —they were arguing that between 20 and 24 states are gonna outlaw abortion. Because what was standing between them and having that outcome was the presence of Justice Kennedy—the knowledge that a district court would stop that law from going into effect because the Supreme Court would strike it down. And now that is gone. Jeff and Elie were arguing that within a year and a half or two years, we’re gonna have a country where there are huge swaths where there are no abortion clinics and women have to travel vast distances to have access to abortion. Now, because Roe v. Wade has been such a divisive issue for so long, I guess you could argue that maybe that kind of traveling and that kind of lack of access will either galvanize people politically in a different way or heal this breach in the country. But on the other hand, at least to me, I just don’t know how women are supposed to live in a society without a right to end their pregnancies and still be free human beings on the planet. I wish I could come up with that idea, but I can’t. And so that part of it alone seems worth really thinking through. I wonder, John, what you think about the politics of that. In those states that now have that freedom to make this move, in those legislatures, how many of them will it really be politically popular to ban abortion? Certainly they’re a whole bunch, but I wonder what the count will end up being? Plotz: There are 17 states that have automatic triggers such that if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, abortion’s automatically outlawed in those states. So there won’t even be any process—it will just happen. Dickerson: Emily, tell me if this is right, but of the 13 cases in which there were 5–4 decisions [this term], Kennedy voted with the conservatives in all 13. Bazelon: Yes. It is a very funny moment for liberals to mourn Kennedy. He delivered nothing for them this term. And you know, to me the most important thing the Supreme Court is doing are the cases that affect the electoral process, and the chances that we’re gonna have of a free and fair vote. And on all of those cases, and not just this term, he voted with the conservatives. And this year he had teed up, with great fanfare back in 2004, a challenge to parties in gerrymandering. He looked like he was just waiting for some social scientist to come up with a valid measure so that he could intervene and stop both parties from redistricting in a way that turns partisan advantage to an extreme sport. There, when faced with these cases from Wisconsin and Maryland, which were well-positioned for a big decision, he totally punted, and there’s just no question that his replacement is going to close the door to partisan gerrymandering challenges. Plotz: We live in a country where increasingly it is incredibly difficult for women to get access to birth control. Then at every turn someone is trying to prevent them from doing it. The pharmacist declines to fill the prescription. The employer is saying they have [a] religious objection to it. Their insurer won’t cover it. And now, it’s the constraint on abortion, the constraint on abortion drugs. Or, if you do want an abortion, being delayed, having to sit through some nonsense lies about the effects [of[ abortion on you. I don’t know why women who have to consider the possibility of childbearing, either because they want to do it or they don’t want to do it, why they’re not enraged, and every single one of them isn’t voting on this issue. It’s insane to me. Bazelon: Some women are enraged. There are a lot of women who think abortion is sinful, and they don’t support access to it. And sometimes when they’re confronted with an unplanned pregnancy in their own lives or families, and they change their mind, and sometimes they don’t. I don’t think women are united on this front at all. Plotz: But it’s not just abortion. It’s birth control. Make abortion illegal, but let me have birth control so I don’t have to get pregnant. Bazelon: Right. And there is almost no space to stand in this country where people say, “I believe in outlawing or restricting abortion, but I want to make the most effective forms of long-acting contraception as available as possible.” Please, yes, let’s make it really easy and cheap for everybody to get IUDs and other long-acting contraceptives. No, that contingency doesn’t exist. Look, you’re right that women’s sexual freedom is on the line. And that there are ways in which the Trump administration has been nibbling away at it in terms of reducing funding for Planned Parenthood, the nonabortion work Planned Parenthood does. And you’re also right about contraception becoming harder to get or harder to pay for. And maybe this will produce a kind of groundswell of women, more women seeing that it’s our lives that we need to be thinking about and voting on. But I think it’s complicated. I think people’s ideas about all of these issues get baked into their more tribal identities. And the women who are supporting President Trump feel like he is embattled. They feel like he’s their guy. They’re culturally alienated from a lot of the people on the pro-choice side of the equation. And people who stay home might feel like this is really a reason to go vote. I just wish I wasn’t so worried about the ways in which we’re making it harder for them to vote. Dickerson: Can we just tally for a moment the possibility here on the court and what it could mean depending on the way the 2018 election rolls out [that Trump] will have named 20 percent of the court? The court will be a locked-in conservative court. You see a president who has unity and power of a kind we haven’t seen—I think, you certainly go back to Johnson, but Johnson was making more deals with Republicans in some cases. He had a split Democratic Party that he had to massage and deal with and handle. There is no split like that in the Republican ranks of any consequence for President Trump. So [there] is really potential for an extraordinary historical consolidation for the president, if his Republicans retain control of the House and the Senate. Plotz: [The court] has very strong approval ratings, and it’s been seen as a fairly neutral arbiter, even though it’s been fairly conservative, for a long time. But it’s largely because of Kennedy’s presence as a counterweight to a lot of what people see as the excesses of both left and right. I do worry that the concretization of the court as a conservative institution is going to be pretty damaging to people’s sense of democracy as a whole. On the left, people are going to be very skeptical because you have this incredibly expansive executive, you have a totally supine Congress that will not do anything, and then a court which is affirming that which the president and that which conservatives want to do. That could be quite disillusioning. I worry about that. One of the things I hear Democrats talking about now, Emily—and I don’t quite understand it because I thought this was a New Deal failure and it was illegal—is expanding the size of the court so that it’s clear that Democrats cannot overturn the conservative majority by the usual means because unless they can force Justice Thomas to retire with a Democratic president, they’re not going to be able to do it. So there’s a discussion about making it a bigger court. Is that realistic? Dickerson: How does that happen? Bazelon: They just could put more people on, the same way FDR tried. Dickerson: But how? Bazelon: The Constitution doesn’t specify the number of justices. It would be a hugely out-of-order move, right? Dickerson: That’s what I mean. I get the theory, but other than having a magic wand, how does it go? Bazelon: The practice is what Mitch McConnell did. You think of it as a counterpoint. You think of it as Mitch McConnell broke all norms, played constitutional hardball by refusing to give Merrick Garland a hearing. The only way to retain and to restore balance on the court is to add some new justices. Dickerson: I get that, but that requires getting control of the Senate back. Bazelon: You need the presidency and the Senate. Plotz: If you have the presidency and the Senate, is it a trivial thing? Bazelon: It’s highly untrivial. Do you mean if it’s possible? Plotz: Is it just matter of saying, “I nominate our 10 th Supreme Court Justice Bazelon, our 11 th Supreme Court Justice Dickerson”? Bazelon: I don’t see what the legal barrier is to it. And maybe there is one that was put in place after FDR’s court packing, but there’s no constitutional amendment that specifies the number of justices, so I don’t think so. I think we’re just talking about deeply embedded norms and expectations and politics. This in itself, this conversation being live, is a kind of check and restraint on the court because Chief Justice Roberts, while a far more conservative figure than Justice Kennedy, cares about the image of the court. He does not want his legacy to be the court going down in flames and becoming this wholly partisan institution. What he is going to try very hard to do when he gets his reliable fifth vote is to write the kinds of opinions that do a lot of change without seeming to do a lot of change. So I don’t think that Roe v. Wade will be directly overturned. I don’t think those trigger mechanisms in those 17 states will go into place. I think he will open the door for states to pass laws that effectively close down clinics and eliminate the right that Roe has preserved, but I don’t think it will be the kind of direct acts of aggression that would put the court so out of sync with the country that you end up with something like court packing.

"Juliette Kayyem, CNN National Security Analyst","CNN analyst Juliette Kayyem is the author of the best-seller "" Security Mom: My Life Protecting the Home and Homeland. "" She is a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School, a former assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration and CEO of Zemcar. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN) Do you know where the children are? For the United States, the answer to that question is still a remarkable ""no."" The Trump administration is in the middle of a humanitarian crisis that it created. And it has exacerbated the tragedy by failing to implement, with urgency, well understood crisis management skills to solve the problem. There is no reason that the reunification of children who were separated by US authorities from their parents should be so chaotic. Just a day after Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar confidently notified the public that the administration would satisfy a court's order to reunite all children younger than 5 by a July 10 deadline, the government reversed course and asked the court for an extension. Sarah Fabian, an attorney for the Justice Department, admitted that the administration still does not know where the parents of nearly 20% of the children are because those parents were released from ICE custody. In other words, the administration would not be able to satisfy the judicial order. These numbers do not include reunification of ""older"" (older than 5) children, which is set for July 26. The lack of any paperwork or accounting means the government is resorting to DNA testing to be able to match these families. And the numbers are all over the place: The government still does not have an exact number of parents or children who remain separated. It has estimated that number to be about 3,000. There are no excuses. Even assuming that the removal policy was sound public policy -- and it was not -- it simply defies logic that our own government would separate children from their families with no serious effort at an accounting and tracking system to be able to reunite them at some stage. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised. After all, the Trump administration, through Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, originally denied even doing it, then balked at the notion that they could stop it. Donald Trump eventually caved to public pressure with an executive order that was so weak it took a court to step in to demand reunification. Was the thought that if the policy wasn't acknowledged these kids would simply -- what, exactly? Go away? Even worse, the reunification process has lacked the urgency and organization that is required of any crisis. Family reunification is a well understood consequence of any disaster; governments spend considerable effort in training and planning procedures (such as organizing non-governmental agencies, churches and schools to assist, creating databases, and picture galleries) in focusing on how to bring children and families back together should they be separated by an event. Family unification is always a priority. After all, disasters happen all the time, and while this one was planned and executed by the government, our efforts would have been better served by implementing disaster management lessons to try to bring them together. What would that take? Well, let's start with the obvious. This is the United States. Unlike Haiti after an earthquake, or Thailand after a tsunami, the basic infrastructure here works: phones, electricity, cameras and computers. The pool of children separated is relatively small compared to many other disasters, such as the Haiti earthquake or Thailand's tsunami; the number of facilities holding these children should be known with some certitude. What's lacking then, is a focus by the very White House that got us to this moment. As reported, the reunification has been stymied by the number of agencies and state and local stakeholders involved in the effort. HHS has borne the brunt of the reunification demands since the children are in their custody. But, multiple players also have strong equities and insights. DHS, whose agencies forcibly removed these children, has been accused of destroying some of the data that links parents to their children, though DHS has denied this claim. There is also the Department of Justice, which oversees the immigration courts; the Department of Defense, which has been preparing to hold families; the State Department, which is getting queries from nations where the children came from; state and local governments where the facilities reside; and private sector contractors who own and manage where these kids are held. What we are missing here is leadership. A point person, an incident commander, a czar, someone in the White House who can manage these various entities and claims and force movement and solution. The White House has remained relatively quiet on this front; the President's homeland security adviser has been notably absent when it comes down to the reunification effort. And so the consequence, outside the mere fact that these children are waiting in limbo, has been a second kind of disaster. It means that what should have been a process to reunite these kids has been too slow; data and numbers have been all over the place, and therefore unreliable; and courts have had to get involved to force the government to do what it could have done on its own. It is clear now that the Trump administration never processed the consequences of its policy and then never processed the urgency of finding a solution. The reason? Others can fill in the blanks: cruelty as a public policy, racism, ignorance, chaos as a means of management, or simply bad execution. Tuesday, the Trump administration is supposed to reunite children younger than 5 with their parents. It will miss that deadline for some of these kids. That we are at this stage defies any appropriate adjectives.

A new exhibition, scheduled to take place from March 7 to April 27 at the Howard Greenberg Gallery, features Van Der Zees photographs from the 1920s through the 1950s, and illustrates this signature style in a powerfully understated way. In photo after photo, his human subjects are buoyed by their inanimate backdrop. And in the unpeopled photos, with just a storefront or restaurant facade, the windows and signs appear to be longing for human contact. Van Der Zee renders a certain reverence for the living community that makes the shops and churches and stores central to its livelihood.

Black-and-white photographs often evoke a particular era, but taken by a black photographer less than 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, of a place where black Americans could strive and thrive, these photos become a coat of arms: a visual symbol that represents the achievements of a most regal family, replete with the uniformed cavalry, the shield of the church, the motto of salvation and the crest of the horizon.

Patrick Howell O'Neill,"Its been a strange, painful couple of days for some Wells Fargo customers.
A tsunami of problems hit the bank this week, leaving some customers not knowing how to access their money. As a result, an army of angry Wells Fargo customers hit social media to report missing their paydays, trouble using debit cards, and problems with mobile banking apps. As of Friday morning, after to days of technical issues, the bank says the problem should finally be fixed.
On Thursday, a power shutdown at one of Wells Fargos main data centers caused a cascade of issues that hamstrung many of the banks core operations. The shutdown occurred after fire suppression systems were activated following utility work on Thursday, but no actual fire happened, according to the company. When the banks backup plans didnt work as expected, customers started to see problems.
The most striking complaints were from customers worried they had missed paydays and companies unable to file payroll. A bank spokesperson said all the transactions were processed, but the bank appears to have failed to properly notify customers about the issue. Customers reports suggest the bank initially had trouble playing catch up as it recovered from the power shutdown and ended up processing the transactions in batches, resulting in delays that caught people off guard.
The spokesperson said everything should now be back to normal as of Friday. A sizable flow of complaints is still rolling in on social media, however. So, if youre a Wells Fargo customer who had issues, its worth checking back with your account to see if all is now well.
Wells Fargo tried to deal with the onslaught of complaints by apologizing repeatedly on Twitter:
As a result of the process to restore systems yesterday, some transactions and balances were not visible in online banking or ATMs earlier today, the bank told Gizmodo on Friday. The transactions were processed normally, and customers can use their accounts with confidence. This issue has now been corrected, and all transactions are now visible. We are experiencing higher than normal volumes so there still may be delays in online banking and contact center response times.

In 2016, French prosecutors said they had uncovered more than $2 million in payments made by Tokyos bidding committee to a little-known Singaporean company, Black Tidings, during the competition to host the 2020 Olympics. That company was found to belong to a close friend of Mr. Diack.
The Japanese authorities, at the request of the French, questioned Mr. Takeda about those payments in 2017, but have taken no action since. Officials said the payments were for consulting work, and a panel commissioned by the Japanese Olympic Committee said in 2016 that it had found that the payments were legitimate.
It was unclear whether the Japanese committee would reopen is investigation in light of the French charges. Calls to the committee went unanswered late Friday.
Tokyo beat out rivals Madrid and Istanbul to win the Summer Olympics for the first time since 1964. Back then, the Olympics symbolized Japans recovery from World War II; similarly, organizers in Japan had seen the 2020 Games as a chance to show the world that their country was bouncing back from the devastating March 2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster at Fukushima. Now, suggestions that corruption played a role in Japans triumph have cast a pall over the preparations.
Former prime minister Yoshiro Mori, who leads the Tokyo Olympics organizing committee, told the Fuji News Network that he was simply shocked by Frances move. The organizing committee was set up jointly by the Japanese Olympic Committee and the Tokyo metropolitan government, and Mr. Takeda serves as one of its vice presidents.
Perhaps perceptions differ from those of Japan, and I hope this is a mistake, Mr. Mori said.
Mr. Takeda is the second Olympic luminary to face serious legal action in recent months. In November, Sheikh Ahmed al Sabah, a member of Kuwaits royal family and close ally of the I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach, temporarily stepped down from the committee after being accused by the Swiss authorities in a forgery case. He was also identified in 2017 as an unindicted co-conspirator in a soccer corruption filed case by the United States Department of Justice. He denies all the allegations.","Tsunekazu Takeda, president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, acknowledged in a statement that he had been questioned by the French authorities, but denied their accusations.",2019-01-11T12:59:57Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Japan’s Olympics Chief Faces Corruption Charges in France,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/world/europe/japan-olympics-corruption-tsunekazu-takeda.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/12/world/12olympics/12olympics-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tsunami,1
Cory Doctorow,"Democratic pollster Celinda Lake surveyed 600 likely voters in 30 ""swing"" districts (districts that are considered too close to call in the 2018 midterms), along with 300 ""surge"" voters (who are less likely to turn out for the 2018 midterms), and found that a platform that advances policies like ""Medicare for all,"" cheaper prescription drugs, and cracking down on Wall Street would deliver these swing districts for the Democrats. These are the policies that the Warren/Sanders wing of the party advocates, and the policies that the Dem establishment (whose go-to donors would suffer under these policies) insist are unwinnable nonstarters. A majority of the voters surveyed preferred a bold economic vision, as opposed to an incremental approach. When asked, 52 percent said they prefer “a bold and comprehensive agenda to rewrite the rules of the economy,” compared to the 36 percent of voters who would choose to “make our economy work for everyone by building on the success of the past.” Another takeaway from the memo, Jayapal said, is that talking about race is not something Democrats “should shy away from.” Support for a policy to “improve opportunity for working and low-income families — white, black, and brown — by investing $2 trillion in rebuilding our roads, bridges, schools, and communities, while creating millions of good-paying jobs” had more support among likely voters than the phrasing of the policy that did not include race. Progressive candidates that win elections are seen as a niche group that “somehow managed to beat the odds,” despite polls showing that progressive policies are actually mainstream values to voters across the country, Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., said.","Democratic pollster Celinda Lake surveyed 600 likely voters in 30 ""swing"" districts (districts that are considered too close to call in the 2018 midterms), along with 300 ""surge"" voters (who are less likely to turn out for the 2018 midterms), and found that a…",2018-03-21T18:57:07Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Boingboing.net'}","Swing district poll suggests that progressive policies could deliver a 2018 ""blue tsunami""",https://boingboing.net/2018/03/21/fuck-the-dccc.html,https://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/New_Deal_N.R.A._3c_1933_issue_U.S._stamp.jpg,,Boingboing.net,tsunami,1
Camila Domonoske,"The world's oldest known wild bird, a Laysan albatross that is at least 68 years old, has laid another egg. Wisdom, who returns each year to Midway Atoll to nest, was sighted back at her favorite nest site in late November, and biologists at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge have now confirmed she's brooding. The remarkable albatross is believed to have laid nearly 40 eggs over the course of her life, although it's impossible to know the precise number. She has single-wingedly transformed scientists' understanding of albatross lifespans and the age limits on avian reproduction. The bird is ""a world renowned symbol of hope for all species that depend upon the health of the ocean to survive,"" according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Wisdom is not just continuing to procreate she's doing it at an impressive clip, too. Many albatrosses take a year off between eggs, because the process of laying and incubating an egg is so energy-intensive. But every year since 2006, Wisdom and her current mate, Akeakamai, have laid an egg at the same nest in Midway Atoll. When not raising their young there, Wisdom and Akeakamai are world travelers. Albatrosses are renowned long-distance fliers, capable of soaring thousands of miles without even flapping their massive wings, more than 6 feet across. As NPR has previously reported, Wisdom has probably flown more than 3 million miles over the last six decades far enough to fly to the moon and back six times. The birds find food on the surface of the ocean, mostly at night. ""They feed on anything that floats on the surface of the water; squid, fish, crustaceans and flying fish eggs,"" the Fish and Wildlife Service writes. ""Unfortunately, this includes marine debris as well; with an estimated 5 tons of plastic that was mistaken for floating fish eggs or squid being fed to chicks each year."" Wisdom, the 68-year-old albatross, has still got it going on. Here she is incubating her egg this week at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. Madalyn Riley/USFWS Volunteer/Flickr Wisdom was first banded by biologist Chandler Robbins in 1956, along with thousands of other albatrosses. At the time, she was already mature, or more than 5 years old. That means we know Wisdom is at least 68 but she could easily be even older than that. Wisdom carried Robbins' band around the globe for decades. Then, astonishingly, the biologist and the bird were reunited in 2002, when Robbins returned to Midway to research the albatrosses again. He rebanded Wisdom, and checking the detailed band records, discovered he himself had placed her original band there 46 years before. In 2006, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff located Wisdom again, and gave her yet another band, this one designed to make her easier to spot for monitoring. Since then, the FWS has kept a close eye on Wisdom's life. In 2011, Wisdom survived a tsunami that crashed into Midway Atoll and killed thousands of birds. In 2015, Wisdom and Akeakamai lost an egg, possibly due to predators, but the couple successfully hatched chicks again in 2016, 2017 and February of this year. Albatrosses lay just one egg at a time. Eggs take two months to hatch, and the chicks live at the nest for five months before they are ready to live on their own. During that time, mother and father alternate between nest duty and food foraging. Akeakamai, by the way, means ""lover of wisdom."" And albatrosses mate for life, though it appears that Wisdom outlived at least one partner before Akeakamai.",Wisdom is known to be at least 68 years old and nests each year at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge.
