Steve Dent,"If you think I'm exaggerating about how dramatic these storms can look, a quick Google image search of "" dirty storm "" will change your mind. All suggest that some kind of impending apocalypse/horsemen scenario is about to take place. Many of the best ones were taken by Negroni himself, but even he admits that the image above is special. ""The photograph with which I obtained second place in the Pano Awards was taken during the violent eruption of the Volcán Calbuco, located in the south of Chile,"" he told Engadget via email. ""The technique was simple: long exposure, tripod and a 80-200mm lens. Approximately 10 minutes to achieve that incredible image that, without a doubt, is my best photograph of an eruption and I think the best taken in the world."" How does this happen? In a regular thunderstorm cloud, lightning is created when rising air makes ice crystals and water droplets bump together, forming static electricity. Once the charges build up enough to surpass the atmosphere's natural insulating tendency, lightning discharges either from one cloud to another or to the ground. Volcanic lightning works on the same principle, but via different actions. Recently, researchers studying one of the world's most active volcanoes, Japan's Mount Sakurajima (above), learned more about how it forms. Using high-speed cameras, they discovered that charge created by churning magma builds up just above the rim, electrifying the ash just above it. That creates an electrostatic potential in the lower portion of the cloud that eventually causes lightning to discharge into the cloud or air, often in the opposite direction of regular lightning. As such, lightning formation is usually limited to the bottom part of the ash plume, and depends strongly on how the plume develops. Chile is located on the Pacific ""Rim of Fire,"" and has 90 active volcanoes, the second most in the world after Indonesia. Negroni has photographed volcanoes like Llaima in the Araucania region, the 2011 eruption of Puyehue-Cordon Caulle, and in 2015, the Villarrica Volcano and Calbuco pictured here. Volcanologists and seismologists have become extremely adept at detecting eruptions ahead of time, so endangered inhabitants were evacuated well ahead of time. Though volcano science has improved dramatically, getting near active ones that produce lightning isn't for the faint of heart. ""Photographing volcanoes is very dangerous and I do not recommend it to anyone,"" Negroni said. ""But if you have the opportunity to do it from a very safe place, it will be an incredible show that nature gives us.""","What do you get when you marry two of Earth's most dramatic natural events, lightning and volcanoes ?

ZAHID SARDAR,"Upstairs, they added dormers and skylights. Downstairs, they ripped out the addition and extended the central foyer by 12 feet for extra living space and a larger kitchen. The back porch was enclosed for a dining area with insulated windows overlooking the water. Nearing the end of her work, Ms. Doermann went to inspect the house. All that remained were final decisions on the interior paint colors and spots to be patched on the siding and roof. Lightning rods lay on the living room floor, ready to be installed. And so they remained the next day, when lightning hit. “If the barn had caught, the fire would have spread to the whole town,” Mr. Cogan said. The bucket brigade saved it and the century-old one-room schoolhouse next door, but not Chapin House. The top floor was incinerated and water ruined the rest. Photo Fannie Allen owns Chapin House with her husband, George Cogan. Credit Stacey Cramp for The New York Times The couple discussed remodeling again. “But nobody could guarantee that we would get rid of the burnt smell,” Mr. Cogan said. Anyway, it would have been just as costly to salvage the remains as to knock them down and rebuild. This time, they started from scratch. The couple decided the 2,500-square-foot replacement home would be a replica of the destroyed one. “Context was important,” Ms. Allen said. A modern building would have clashed with the nearby gabled stone town hall and 19th-century Congregational church. So a new Chapin House rose on the old stone foundation. To save time, even mainlanders on the construction team lived on Isle au Haut on and off from August 2009 through June 2010.“During the winter, it was hard enough to get materials to the island and get waste off it,” Ms. Doermann said, never mind the workers. The mail boat that ferried between the mainland and town dock could transport small loads, but large barges were needed for lumber and Dumpsters and were often delayed by tides and weather. Photo A replacement for an original square stained-glass window came from Portland, Ore. Credit Stacey Cramp for The New York Times “Perhaps that’s why islanders don’t get rid of things and reuse what’s there,” Ms. Doermann said. “Many houses have pieces from other houses because of that ingrained mentality of recycling.” Indeed, Bill Stevens, the roads commissioner-turned-contractor who did the septic site work, gathered Chapin House’s charred but usable frame and windows to build a painting studio for his wife. Ms. Doermann turned her energies to reclamation, as well. Pine beams from a Boston warehouse were milled for the new house’s main-level flooring (now with radiant heat), while the hand-hewn floorboards upstairs came from a Nova Scotia barn.

Rachel Becker,"Lightning during a recent thunderstorm appears to have killed six cows in Queensland, Australia last week, the Beaudesert Times reports. The cows were discovered days after the storm — dead and bloated, lined up against a metal fence. The bizarre incident is a reminder that while lightning strikes may be rare, they’re also deadly — particularly for big animals like cows. The ranch owner’s son, Derek Shirley, discovered the four cows and two calves when he surveyed the property after the storm. The cows had been dead for enough time to have puffed up and rolled onto their sides with their legs in the air. But none had any marks on them, Shirley told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The timing made lightning a likely suspect. It’s happened before; lightning killed 323 reindeer in Norway in August 2016. “It isn’t that unusual to see farm animals, or wild animals such as reindeer, being killed by lightning,” lightning safety expert John Jensenius with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Verge’s Angela Chen at the time.

Four cows and two calves have been found dead in a paddock in Beaudesert, they’re all in a line and there isn’t a mark on them. What happened? Dr Karl explains: http://ab.co/2tqqmDf Posted by ABC Brisbane on Wednesday, March 7, 2018 Most lightning deaths, particularly mass livestock deaths, are caused by the ground current. That’s the energy that radiates along the ground after lightning strikes a tree, or the ground nearby. If you — or, say, a couple hundred reindeer — are standing in the wrong spot, at the wrong time, that energy can travel through the ground, up one leg, and down the other. As that electrical current travels through the body, it can stop the heart, Jensenius told Chen. And the farther that electricity travels before it leaves the body, the more damage it can do, according to the National Weather Service. So big animals like cows or reindeer are especially at risk. Graphic: NOAA/National Weather Service Lightning Science Lightning can travel along metal wires — like in fences. But it’s also possible that the metal wires on the fence conducted the electricity — zapping the cows huddled along it. While metal doesn’t actually draw the lightning, according to the NWS, metal objects can become a conduit for the lightning’s energy. “Whether inside or outside, anyone in contact with anything connected to metal wires, plumbing, or metal surfaces that extend outside is at risk,” the NWS says. Livestock deaths can be hard to track, so we don’t actually know how common events like these are, Jensenius said. But we do know that fewer people die from lightning strikes these days than they used to. In the 1930s and ’40s, between 300 and 400 people in the US were killed each year by lightning. Over the past ten years, the number has dropped to an average of about 35 people per year in the US. To keep those numbers down, these latest lightning deaths are a good reminder to get inside during thunderstorms and stay away from anything that can conduct electricity — barbed wire fences included.","Lightning during a recent thunderstorm appears to have killed six cows in Queensland, Australia last week, the Beaudesert Times reports.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"As unearthly as it may be, Jupiter shares a phenomenon with our own planet that you might find very familiar: lightning strikes. And lightning on Jupiter is somehow both more (and less) like the lightning on Earth than scientists previously thought. Every spacecraft to have visited Jupiter, as far back as Voyager in 1979, has spotted flashes of lightning. So it makes sense that the Juno orbiter, which arrived at the gas giant in 2016, would spot it, too. Some newly published results greatly expand our knowledge of these Jovian lightning strikes. “We succeeded in collecting the largest set of lightning detections known up to now,” study author Ivana Kolmašová from the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague told Gizmodo. Voyager scientists first discovered lightning on Jupiter in the form of radio waves they generated called “whistlers.” When played as audio, they have a slowly descending whistling pitch that sounds like a bomb falling, distortions caused by their passing through the planet’s plasma. But the whistlers aren’t the whole story. Visiting crafts should have also detected a higher-energy flash called a sferic, but they didn’t, making scientists wonder whether Jupiter’s lightning was in some way different from Earth’s. Scientists also wondered how frequently lightning struck and where it actually occurred. Two instruments on Juno, the Waves plasma and radio wave detector and the Microwave Radiometer, gave answers to both of these mysteries, while simultaneously posing new questions. The Waves instrument on Juno discovered six times more lightning than originally observed by Voyager, with much shorter-lasting whistlers, which probably has more to do with Juno’s differing orbit around Saturn. There were up to four lightning strikes per second, very similar to rates here on Earth. The Microwave Radiometer spotted the high-energy sferics that other craft had been unable to detect. The researchers published the results in a pair of papers today, one in Nature and the other in Nature Astronomy. Previous missions like Voyager may have missed much of the lightning because they were orbiting the gas giant inside of the Io plasma torus, a noisy ring of electrically charged particles around Jupiter, said Bill Kurth, University of Iowa physicist who helped discover whistlers with Voyager. Kurth assisted in the analysis on the new results. So, in a sense, Jupiter’s lightning is more similar to Earth’s than scientists thought—it happens about as frequently, and produces similar radio emissions. But there are new mysteries. Unlike on Earth, Jupiter’s lightning mainly appears closer to its poles, and more often in the northern hemisphere than in the southern, Kurth told Gizmodo. “We’re surprised every time we go around,” he said, “even when we go back to planet for the seventh spacecraft or so.” What does all this mean? There are probably convective storms on Jupiter with water, similar to the thunderheads on Earth, but they demonstrate a different movement of that water than on our own planet. Thankfully the Juno mission will continue its work until at least the early 2020s, sending us more fascinating insights into our solar system’s largest planet. Fingers crossed, all of the probe’s equipment will continue working in the extreme Jovian environment. “We hope that the instrumentation onboard Juno stays in a good shape under the harsh radiation conditions close to Jupiter,” Kolmašová said. “We may expect further surprises in future research and we are looking forward to finding them.” [ Nature, Nature Astronomy ]","As unearthly as it may be, Jupiter shares a phenomenon with our own planet that you might find very familiar: lightning strikes.

Ed Cara,"When a 32-year-old man was struck and killed by lightning while visiting Sunken Meadow State Park in Long Island, New York this August, he became the first lightning fatality recorded in the state since 2016. And he was only the 16th lightning death reported in the entire U.S. this year. As late as the 1940s, lightning used to kill hundreds of Americans every year. But even as our population has tripled, these deaths have become vanishingly rare, largely thanks to advances in city architecture that steer ground strikes away from humans. But the New York mans tragic death illustrates how dangerous lightning can still be. In his case, he was reportedly struck while standing beneath a tree. But while the heat and energy of a direct hita lightning bolt can reach temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sunis more than enough to kill, the truth is that lightning causes death in many strange ways. Sometimes, as with people who send off a powerful streamer discharge, lightning can be fatal without physically hitting a person at all.

Sam Rutherford,"For years, Apples mobile devices have been off in their wonderland of proprietary ports while the rest of the tech world did its best to converge on a few simple standards. Im talking about the 30-pin connector used on the original iPod and iPhone, which later gave way to the Lightning connector in 2012. And while I do have to give Apple credit for going full USB-C on its laptops a while back, lets not forget about the old MagSafe connectors Apple was using prior to that. But today, when Apple announced that its new iPad Pro was ditching its traditional Lightning connector in favor of USB-C, the company set in motion a subtle shift that could see the end of proprietary ports across Apples entire range of products. From a technical standpoint, the benefits are obvious. USB-C offers faster charging and data speeds than Lightning plus USB-A currently offers, and it lets the new iPad Pros do things like send 5K video to an external monitor and even reverse charge other devices. USB-C also helps simplify the tangle of cable and dongles you currently need to connect all of Apples various products together. But with the new iPad Pro, the same cable you use to charge a MacBook can also be used to charge Apples fancy tablet. Neat. More importantly, now that Apple has finally made the first iPad with USB-C, it wouldnt make sense not to continue this trend. (Though that hasnt necessarily stopped Apple from making odd choices before.) Weve already seen small consequences of this on the new Apple Pencil, which recharges magnetically instead of using Lightning or even USB-C. But the real coup would be what happens when this strategy cascades to the iPhone. Currently, even a new iPhone XS comes with a charging brick that features USB-A on one end and a Lightning connector on the other, which is far from ideal, especially when it comes to recharging the phone. But if the iPhone and future iPads make the switch to USB-C, suddenly, the only cable Apple folk may ever need to connect all their gadgets is a double-sided USB-C cord. Thats been the dream of the Universal Serial Bus all along. No more confusion when thinking about which cable you need, theyre all the same. And when you look outside of Apples walled garden, this change could make it possible for iPhone and Android people to live together (slightly) more harmoniously. The days of Does anyone have an iPhone charger? simply wont exist anymore. There wont be a need to specify. That said, aside from Apple putting USB-C on the new iPad Pro, none of this has happened yet. And with Apples patents allowing the company to take a cut on every single product made with a Lightning port, fully committing to USB-C could have an important impact on its bottom line. But at least this one little change makes it seem like a total switch to USB-C is a possibility. Maybe.","For years, Apple’s mobile devices have been off in their wonderland of proprietary ports while the rest of the tech world did its best to converge on a few simple standards.

Jacob Kleinman,"One of Apple’s big new features for the iPhone X (and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus ) is wireless charging, but if you care more about speed than convenience, there’s another perk you should know about. The company’s newest smartphones all support fast charging, too. Apple claims you can get from 0 to 50% charge in 30 minutes—just not with the charger that comes in the box. The Verge has a handy guide to all the gear you’ll need to fast charge the iPhone X, 8 or 8 Plus. Here’s a quick rundown of the key details. The Fastest Fast Charging Option According to Apple, you’ll need a USB-C to Lightning cable to fast charge your new iPhone, but the company ships each phone with a regular USB-A cable instead. That means you’ll need to buy a new cable, and in this case you should really get it from Apple. ($25 for a 1-meter cable or $35 for 2 meters.) The company still has total control over Lightning input, so any third-party USB-C to Lightning cables you might see are non-sanctioned and might not be safe to use. That’s particularly important when you’re transferring as much power as possible to your new iPhone. Thankfully, you won’t need to spend as much on a USB-C charging brick, since that technology isn’t controlled by Apple. If you have a new MacBook, you can use that brick for your iPhone. If not, The Verge has a few suggestions, with the cheapest being Aukey’s for $23.99. Cheaper Fast Charging Options If you want a faster charge but don’t feel like shelling out for extra cables, you still have a few options. Just don’t expect to hit 50% battery power in 30 minutes if you go this route. The easiest solution is to just use an iPad charger, assuming you have one lying around. Apple added this option years ago with the iPhone 6, and it’s still a great way to give your charging speed a boost. If you don’t have the right charger on hand, you can also grab one for pretty cheap. Amazon has a charging brick with two USB ports for just $9.99 that will get the job done just fine.","One of Apple’s big new features for the iPhone X (and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus) is wireless charging, but if you care more about speed than convenience, there’s another perk you should know about.

According to the CDC, high temperatures kill more people in the U.S. than hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, earthquakes, and floods combined. Here’s how to survive a heat wave when you’re going to be outside all day. It’s Heat Week, and we’re on fire! The heat and humidity have gone right to our heads, and all we can think about is getting into a pool and staying there until September. But because we have jobs to do, damn it, here’s the summer content you’ve been craving: from the best ice-cold cocktails to how to keep from broiling in the summer sun, we’ve got your (sweaty) back. According to all the Instagram pictures of toes stretched out on deck chairs, many people looove… Read more Read How Extreme Heat Kills To understand how to survive in extreme heat, you need to know how extreme eat can harm you. Outside of making you severely uncomfortable, heat can slowly but surely shut your vital systems down—and the symptoms can be surprisingly hard to notice, especially in children and the elderly. There’s more to it than the sun slowly cooking you with it’s all-powerful rays. Here’s how it works: A high pressure weather system moves in. That system pulls air down from the upper atmosphere toward the ground, then the air compresses and heats up. This high pressure system prevents cloud cover and inhibits wind, making the sun’s already intense heat even worse. When we spend time outside in this heat, our core body temperature rises, triggering our body’s cool-down system: sweat. We dissipate the heat by sweating out moisture, which then evaporates on our skin to cool us down. But in extreme heat, we either sweat too much for it to have time to evaporate, or high humidity prevents moisture from evaporating. That leads to more and more sweating as our body kicks your cool-down system into overdrive, and that leads to dehydration. At this point, you start to get very thirsty because your body is desperately trying to replenish the fluids you’ve lost while sweating. You also start to run low on electrolytes, which can cause symptoms like muscle cramps, exhaustion, and fainting. If the heat isn’t dissipated, you become in danger of suffering heatstroke. The heat completely overwhelms the body’s ability to cool itself and you stop sweating entirely. At that point, the heat overloads your brain and you become dizzy, weak, uncoordinated, confused, nauseated, and possibly unconscious. Eventually, your blood gets thicker and has less oxygen due to water loss and the heart and kidneys have to work harder to pump your blood and clean it. In response, the heart tries to pump more blood faster, which heats up the body even more. As your heart desperately tries to pump blood, your skin starts to feel cold and clammy. Before you know it, your brain can’t handle the lack of oxygen and shuts down for good. Fortunately, as horrifying as that all sounds, there’s a lot you can do prevent it from happening. Wear Loose, Lightweight, Light-Colored Clothing Made of Cotton The clothing you wear in extreme heat is paramount to both your comfort and your safety. Clothing should be loose enough to allow air flow between the fabric and your skin so evaporation of sweat is possible. Remember, no evaporation means no cooling. Your clothing should also be lightweight, meaning both light to carry on your body (more weight means more work, which means more burning of energy and more generation of heat) and not so thick that air can’t flow through the fabric. Light colored clothing, like white, beige, and other similar tones are ideal as well. Lighter colors reflect sunlight, thus reflecting some heat. Most importantly, make sure your clothing is made of cotton. Cotton absorbs excess moisture on your body, which aids the evaporation process so your body can cool down. Fancy sweat-wicking fabrics may be great for a temperature regulated gym or during cooler hours of the day, but they aren’t ideal for high heat. This week Hack Your City went to Black Rock City, the seasonal settlement that fills up every… Read more Read Soak Clothing, Hats, and Towels In Water Because cotton is so good at absorbing and retaining moisture, you can soak your clothing in water and cool off that way. Take off your shirt, then dunk it in a stream or pour some water from a bottle all over it. Give it a wring, then put it back on. You’ll cool off quickly. Hats are useful in more ways than one. They can keep sun out of your eyes and off your face, but they can also be soaked in water to keep your head nice and cool. Let outside sources of water evaporate on your skin so you don’t have to sweat as much. Last but not least, it’s a good idea to carry a towel or rag with you when you head outside in the heat. Get it wet, wring it out, then wear it on the back of your neck. There are even some specialty towels out there designed to hold water better than cotton and keep you cool longer. Find Shade and Spend Time In It Regularly On days where it feels like the sun is mere feet away, shade is everything. No matter what you’re doing outside, you should be looking for shade and cooling off in it as much as possible. When someone is being treated for possible heatstroke, medical personnel follow the “cool first, transport second” protocol, and it’s a good rule to follow for your own adventures. If you’re feeling your temperature rise, find shade and cool yourself before you try to move again. Don’t try to suffer through the heat in long spurts because you think you’re close to your destination. Take it slow and cool. Don’t Overexert Yourself Here’s the deal: the more you move the hotter you’ll get; the less you move the more you’ll cool down. Around 80 percent of the energy you burn when you exercise is transformed into heat, and you don’t need any more of that when it’s already roasting outside. Take breaks (in the shade) and don’t push yourself too hard. Exertional heatstroke, or what’s known as sunstroke, is one of the top three killers of athletes and soldiers in training. The scorching summer heat is hard on our bodies, our moods, and our electric bills. Don’t let the… Read more Read Drink Water and Replenish Electrolytes Drink water! The human body does a pretty decent job of keeping you cool, but you have to provide it the fuel it needs to do so. That means drinking so much water you think it might be too much. Also, replenish your body’s electrolytes with salt if you can. And avoid drinks with alcohol, caffeine, and carbonation. These types of liquids can lead to dehydration or slow the hydration process. Obviously, you don’t want to waste water if you know you have a limited supply and a long way to travel, but you should pack enough to drink a lot during your time outdoors. Bring more than you think you need. Avoid Using Handheld Electric Fans As nice as they may feel, FEMA recommends you don’t use electric fans when temperature outside is more than 95 degrees Fahrenheit. They explain that fans create air flow and a false sense of comfort, but they don’t do anything to actually reduce your body temperature. Furthermore, they dry the skin so evaporation can’t occur. This false comfort and lack of cooling could lead to a surprise attack of sunstroke. Carry a Misting Bottle Instead of a fan, carry a misting bottle. It’s your best bet for providing comfort in the high heat. A quick spurt or two of water covers your face in tiny water droplets that will quickly evaporate and help you cool off. It will only help lower your temperature a little bit, but it will help you feel more comfortable. Just make sure it’s a misting bottle, not a spraying bottle, so you can conserve water and provide more even coverage on your skin. If the heat outside is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, be cautious and only go out if you are fully prepared. Heat above 100 degrees should be avoided if possible, and if it’s 104 degrees or higher outside, don’t even try. It’s not worth the risk.","There are a lot of intense dangers in nature, but perhaps the scariest of all is a hot, silent killer.

Connie Loizos,"Lightning Labs, a young, Bay Area-based startup, is trying to make it easier for users to send bitcoin and litecoin to each other without the costly and time consuming process of settling their transactions on the blockchain. It has investors excited about its work, too. The company is announcing today that it has raised $2.5 million in seed funding to date from a kind of list of big names in payments and beyond, including Square and Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey, Square exec Jacqueline Reses, serial-founder-turned investor David Sacks, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, Eventbrite cofounder Kevin Hartz, BitGo CTO Ben Davenport, and Robinhood cofounder Vlad Tenev, along with The Hive, Digital Currency Group, and others. In a tweet earlier today, Sacks characterized the company as “one of the most important projects in crypto overall.” Why and how does it work exactly? For starters, Lightning Labs works off Lightning Network, a protocol that’s sometimes called the second layer of bitcoin. (Think of it like the HTTP for blockchains.) Boosters of this newer layer, including Lightning Labs, see it as a way to exponentially boost the number and speed of transactions of the bitcoin blockchain without increasing the size of blocks — batches of transactions that are confirmed and subsequently shared on bitcoin’s public ledger. It’s all a little confusing to people still trying to get a handle on how the blockchain works (including yours truly), but Lightning Labs essentially aims to let two or more people — and eventually machines — create instant, high-volume transactions that still use the underlying blockchain for security. How: they assign funds on the blockchain into an entry that requires both to sign off on what they plan to spend. Say this is $20. After that transaction is recorded, they can transact that amount of money between each other as many times as they want. If they want to change the amount of that spend, they just update the entry on the blockchain. If you’re wondering whether there’s room for grift if these transactions move further from the blockchain, so were we. But one of the core tenants of Lightning Labs is that it allows you to do away with counter-party risk. You don’t have to trust someone you are transacting with because — ostensibly, anyway — no one can steal your cryptocurrency. First, a so-called cryptographic “proof” is created when users initially broadcast that first transaction (and updated versions of it) to the blockchain and that proof ensures that if one party tries to steal from another, not only will be incapable of doing so but as a penalty for trying, the thief’s currency will be awarded to the person they were trying to swindle. As for people who try hopping offline in the middle of a transaction, again with the aim of stealing someone else’s cryptocurrency, there are separate safety measures in place in the form of time-out periods that, when they expire, ensure that the currency sender gets back his or her money. The blockchain acts as a kind of unbiased arbiter. Lightning Labs isn’t the only outfit that has sprung up around creating these contracts, but it’s the furthest along, suggests cofounder and CEO Elizabeth Stark, who says more than 1,800 developers are part of a Slack channel and that thousands of volunteers helped her seven-person team find glitches in the alpha version of their open-source software. Their help enabled them to, starting today, release a beta version that’s open to anyone, though it’s only truly developer friendly at this point. (You have to write command code to use it. Stark says a much friendlier user interface will be available down the road.) Stark also suggests that because the beta version is just being released that people only transact with the amount of money they might carry in their wallet. In fact, there are limits on how much you can transact using its software, which Stark says is less to protect users from theft than from them “putting their life savings in bitcoin.” (The presumption: that people will start using bitcoin thanks to the Lightning protocol, because it will let them transact far more quickly and easily in tiny amounts than is possible today.) Finally, for now, Lightning Labs — which is enabling people to transact with bitcoin and litecoin for now — is available on desktops only, though a mobile version is coming. We asked Stark yesterday about the origin of the company. A former lecturer at Stanford and Yale who taught about digital copyrights, she said she realized in 2016 that if bitcoin was going to be “used by the entire world, it couldn’t happen on blockchain.” Like a lot of people, too, Stark says she got excited by the prospect of micropayments, including for artists and musicians.” When she edited a paper about the Lightning protocol and realized it might be possible for people and computers to send high volumes of small payments — think thousands if not millions, to each other — for there to be a genuine currency of the web, she suggests she jumped in with both feet with cofounder and CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun. “He’s the genius behind our work here,” she says of Osuntokun, who has two computer science degrees from UC Santa Barbara and who graduated in 2016. To learn more, you might enjoy this talk that Stark gave on the importance of the layers that Lightning Labs and others are building atop the blockchain.","Lightning Labs, a young, Bay Area-based startup, is trying to make it easier for users to send bitcoin and litecoin to each other without the costly and time consuming process of settling their transactions on the blockchain.

Emily Long,"The iPhone XS and XS Max woes continue: In addition to cellular and wifi connectivity issues, some users are reporting charging problems with their devicesmainly when their iPhones screens are turned off. When they go to plug their devices in to give them some juice, some users report having to first wake the screen in order to initiate charging. Others say their devices must be unlocked or have the screen lit up when the Lightning cable is first plugged in. Users in online forums like Reddit and Macrumors have speculated about the cause and proposed a number of solutions, including enabling USB accessories in locked mode (found under Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode ) and using Apples official Lightning cable instead of third-party cables. However, the results of these suggestions are mixed. It appears that upgrading to the public beta of iOS 12.1 is the best way to eliminate the charging issue, but then youre running potentially buggier software. You could also solve the issue by purchasing a wireless charging pad for your iPhone, but then youre paying extra to solve what appears to be a temporary software bug, at worst.","The iPhone XS and XS Max woes continue: In addition to cellular and wifi connectivity issues, some users are reporting charging problems with their devices—mainly when their iPhones’ screens are turned off.

Jacob Kleinman,"Lightning bolts suck. Thankfully, the painstaking work of software engineer Stephen Cook doesn’t include any of these (cheater) tricks. In his simplified version of Mario Kart, which you can play right in your browser, you just have to worry about easy driving, not item management. The impressive part of Cook’s Nintendo knockoff is that it’s built almost entirely in CSS —a stylesheet language mostly used to control the look and feel of the websites you visit. CSS has evolved over the years, and crafty creators can now use it to build everything from the Mona Lisa to a playable chess game. Despite those advancements, Cook’s version of the classic game is still pretty simple. You can only drive your kart left and right (using the “A” and “D” keys, respectively), and the map is really just a single straight road without any obstacles. Sorry, Rainbow Road fans—no crazy maneuvering for you. Though the game defaults to Mario, you can switch characters if you’d rather play as Bowser. In a blog post explaining the process, Cook explains that he picked Mario’s recurring enemy “because I respect how he’s not afraid to fail repeatedly at a task, despite not having a clear end-goal.” That’s kind of like when your fellow Mario Kart players hit a lightning bolt just as you’re just about to make a critical jump, bumping you back from first to last place and making you question why you keep playing this game and/or maintaining your friendships.","Lightning bolts suck.

JAMES PONIEWOZIK,"Most superhero series, for instance, begin with young protagonists discovering their powers. “Black Lightning,” airing Tuesdays, is the reluctant comeback story of a hero grappling with heroism’s limits. By day, Jefferson is a high school principal, something of a local hero for his outreach to troubled students. Until nine years ago, though, he patrolled the fictional city of Freeland, wearing a space-age electro-suit that one observer likens to a Parliament-Funkadelic outfit. Photo Mr. Williams in Black Lightning’s Parliament-Funkadelic-type superhero duds. Credit Bob Mahoney/CW Targeted by the police for vigilantism, he wearily gave it up. But he’s drawn back in as the city is overrun by a brutal gang, the One Hundred, which ends up threatening his two daughters: Anissa (Nafessa Williams) and Jennifer (China Anne McClain). In the first two episodes, “Black Lightning” is suffused with the ideas of Black Lives Matter, though it comes at them from an angle. The pilot, for instance, involves street protests, not against police brutality but against gang violence. But the parallel images are unmistakable, as is the use of smartphone video by ordinary citizens, in both episodes, as a means of fighting back. In a key early scene, Jefferson is driving and arguing with Anissa, whom he just bailed out after her arrest at a protest. He quotes the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: “Returning violence for violence multiplies violence.” She answers with Fannie Lou Hamer: “I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired.” Suddenly, they’re pulled over by police officers — one of them white — who suspect Jefferson in a liquor-store robbery, though he’s in a suit and driving a Volvo wagon. For a moment, his eyes flare with the glow of his suppressed power, but he reins it in. The superhero who must hide his nature from the authorities is old hat in comics. So are arguments over vigilantism and the limits of nonviolence. But the context of “Black Lightning” is everything. Here, the image — a powerful black man quelling his emotion and struggling to present as calm, smaller, nonthreatening — has the strength of parable. The weakest part of the show so far is the actual superheroism. The One Hundred’s members are thinly sketched, and they make paltry competition for an armored superguy who shoots lightning from his fingertips. Their leader is a more intriguing, ruthless presence: Tobias Whale (Marvin Jones III, who raps under the name Krondon ), an African-American with albinism who denigrates other black people as “darkies.” But the arch-villain gets little screen time early on. Mr. Williams has to carry most of the story. Fortunately, he’s up to it, inhabiting his character’s strength, his burden and his sense of humor in a series that’s picked an opportune moment to strike.

"Shep McAllister on Kinja Deals, shared by Shep McAllister to Lifehacker","Save big on a popular Brother laser printer, a powerful pressure washer, and an affordable smartphone, plus the rest of today’s best deals. For all the best Memorial Day sales on apparel, home goods, tech, and more, head over to our roundup post. We’ve rounded up the best Memorial Day Sales happening around the web, and will continue to update… Read more Read Bookmark Kinja Deals and follow us on Twitter to never miss a deal. The trusty Brother HL2380DW laser printer has long been a hit with our readers, but it was recently replaced by the HL2395DW, and the new model is on sale for its best price ever. Compared to the 2380, the new one is slightly faster (36 ppm vs. 32), uses less electricity, and has NFC for direct printing from compatible Android phones. All the basics that have made Brother printers a hit are still there too, including duplex printing, AirPrint and Google Cloud Print support, relatively inexpensive and long lasting toner, and a complete lack of the carriage jams and destroyed paper you’ve come to expect from inkjet printers. If you aren’t satisfied with your current printer (which is a pretty safe bet if it’s not a Brother), this is a great buy at $100. We see deals with some regularity on Anker’s 6' nylon-wrapped PowerLine+ Lightning cables, but today, you can also upgrade your standard 3' cords for just $8 each. The PowerLine+ feels ridiculously nice in the hand, is way more durable than Apple’s first party cable, and comes with an 18 month warranty, so what’s not to love? Just use promo code AKLTNNEW on any color of either size to save. Logitech MX Sound Computer Speaker System | $70 | Amazon If you’re still listening to your computer through its built-in speakers, stop torturing yourself and buy Logitech’s MX Sound 2.0 audio system for $70, or $30 less than usual. In addition to connecting to your PC with a 3.5mm cable, the MX Sound also includes Bluetooth to pair to your phones and tablets, with one-touch switching between devices. And not for nothing, they happen to look way better than most computer speakers, which matters for something that sits out on your desk all day. Yamaha’s YAS-207BL was the first sound bar on the market to simulate surround sound with Dolby DTS Virtual:X, which bounces audio off your walls and ceiling without the aid of satellite speakers. I tried it myself, and the result was surprisingly convincing. If you’ve been holding out for a good deal, it just dropped to $270, or $30 less than usual. We’ve seen it go a bit lower on a few occasions, but this is still a solid price if you’re in the market. While it’s certainly no flagship, if you’re in need of a decent phone for not much money, this Prime-exclusive LG X Charge is down to just $100 in today’s Amazon Gold Box. That’s $30-$70 less than usual, an all-time low, and a great price for a phone with expandable storage, a 13 MP camera, and an octacore processor. Just note that it’s not compatible with Verizon. You never want to be without the proper charging gear, and Anker’s PowerPack bundles everything you need to keep your battery out of the red when you travel. For $50 (with promo code ANKERPP1), you get an aluminum PowerCore+ 10,050mAh battery pack, a four-port travel wall charger, and nylon-braided PowerLine+ Lightning and microUSB cables, all packaged in a premium carrying case. You’re saving a bunch of money here by bundling, even accounting for sale prices on the individual gear, and this could make a great Father’s Day gift as well. Amazon is selling the Kano Complete Computer Kit for just $200 today, a savings of $50 and the lowest price we’ve seen. Instead of dropping about that much on a week of nominally enriching summer day camp that you’ll still have to drive to and fro, I suggest you grab one of these. Our deal researcher Corey wrote a lot more about his daughters’ experience with the Kano here, if you’d like to know more. While generally not all-time low prices, I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a more wide-ranging Philips Hue sale than the one Amazon’s running right now. In addition to individual bulbs, standalone lights, and starter packs, there are some products here I didn’t even know existed. Anker’s SoundBuds Curves were a runner up in our recent affordable headphone poll (they were only beat out by Anker’s own SoundBuds Slims), and you can grab a pair for just $22 today. Just use promo code 4N7I447D at checkout to save $4. The SoundBuds Curve are the sportiest member of the SoundBuds family, and are designed with active users in mind. Their ear wings ensure they stay put while you exercise, and an internal hydrophobic coating means your sweat won’t fry them. Their best spec though? 12.5 hours of battery life, which is basically unheard of in the space. TCL’s P and C-series TVs are noteworthy for offering Dolby Vision HDR for a fraction of the price of most competitors, and you can get last year’s 55"" C-series set for $500 right now, or $100 less than usual. The 65"" is also $100 off its previous low price at $800, but it looks like it will sell out soon. These were technically TCL’s top of the line sets, but actually offered slightly worse contrast performance than the cheaper P-series, due to the lack of full-array direct backlighting. However, the trade-off is a slimmer, sleeker design, and you’ll still get a terrific picture and Dolby Vision. If size trumps features in your hierarchy of new TV needs, here are a couple of 75"" sets that are surprisingly affordable for Memorial Day. This RCA is the barest of barebones sets. While it does have 4K support, it lacks HDR, and even built-in smart apps. But you can always plug in a 4K-compatible streaming dongle for the same effect, and at just $1,050 (including the mandatory $50 freight shipping charge), it’s one of the cheapest 75"" sets we’ve ever seen. Or, for about $250 more, you can upgrade to a Vizio E-series with some HDR support (not Dolby Vision at this price, sorry) and built-in Chromecast. It’s still not going to give you the best picture quality on the market, but most higher-end 75"" sets cost well upwards of $2,000, even during major sale events. It’s not one of the high-end models with GPS or LTE, but $149 for a 38mm Apple Watch Series 1 (or $179 for the 42mm ) is one of the best deals we’ve ever seen on Apple’s increasingly popular wearable. Update : Also available at Walmart, if you want to pick it up in person today. Somewhat confusingly, the Series 1 is not quite the same as the original Apple Watch, as it has a second generation chip for faster performance. We don’t know how long this Jet deal will last, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it sold out soon. Will these noise-canceling Bluetooth over-ears sound as good as, say, Sony’s? I doubt it. But they’re significantly (significantly!) cheaper at just $40, and should still be able to turn down the volume on the background noise in your office, or on an airplane. DirecTV Now is one of the better over-the-top cable replacements out there, and with this deal, there’s very little reason not to give it a try. For a limited time, if you prepay for three months of the service at $35 per month, you’ll get a 4K Apple TV included for free. That Apple TV costs $179 normally, so you’re basically getting a $74 discount on the box, plus three months of live TV. No brainer. VPNs have been in the news, and whether you want to get around video geoblocks, circumvent proxy filters, or just keep prying eyes out of your browsing data while using sketchy public Wi-Fi, reader-favorite Private Internet Access has a deal to fit your needs. Last month, they offered our readers $10 off two year memberships, but this time around, you get a few more choices, ranging from a quick taste of the service to an extended commitment with additional savings: These deals are only for our readers, but we aren’t sure how long they’ll be available, so go ahead and sign up while you can. Update: This deal is back if you missed it a few weeks ago. Victorinox’s Fibrox 8” chef’s knife is one of your favorite chef’s knives period, and by far the best value in the industry. It’s also the knife I’ve used almost every day for almost five years. Amazon has it for $30 right now, which is an absolute steal for the quality you’re getting. It’s a common enough occurrence, but you probably don’t have a great solution for it: When you travel with your pet, how do you transport their food? This $5 container is designed just for this purpose, and includes two built-in bowls too. Your phone’s alarm can certainly wake you up at an appointed time, but I think it’s worth having a real alarm clock that lets you to see the time at night without waking up your phone. This one from Mpow has a large display, a time projector that can beam the time onto your ceiling, an FM radio, and even a USB charging port for your phone. Get it for just $22 today with promo code 3LDTDMPC. Pressing isn’t always the best way to prepare garlic, but it’s certainly the fastest, and it extracts far more flavor (for better or worse) than regular mincing. If you like to cook, a garlic press should definitely be in your toolkit for $8 with promo code GXOUW8WH. It’s a pen. It’s a flashlight. It’s a multi-tool. It’s an emergency glass breaker. Most importantly though, it’s $10 with promo code T35CVTMD. You might not have an immediate need for a pressure washer, but if you own a home, it’s a useful thing to stash in the back or your garage. Today only, Amazon’s marked down a powerful Sun Joe washer down to $159, way below its usual ~$250, and the best price ever. At 2300 PSI, this is far more powerful than most electric pressure washers, so get yours before the deal is blasted away. Snack on some peanut butter on the go with this honey peanut butter packs from Justin’s. This pack of 10 is just $6, which means it’s under a $1 each for a snack on the go. It’s a matter of taste, but some might say that the new, cheaper Nest Thermostat E is even nicer looking than the original, while still packing in almost all of the original model’s features. It’s a bargain at its usual $170, but today you can get it for $149 from Walmart, plus a FREE Google Home Mini, which is arguably the best deal we’ve ever seen. If you haven’t steam cleaned your carpet in awhile, get ready for a rude awakening; it’s going to be gross. This highly rated Hoover SteamVac includes a heated drying mode, and a handheld tool so you can use it on furniture and car upholstery as well. Get it for just $89 from Jet today, and thank us later. You’ve heard of Automatic’s smart driving assistant, but if $130 is too rich for your blood, this OBD2 dongle costs over 90% less (with code LMD5ITVY), connects to any iPhone or Android device over Wi-Fi, and can fulfill many of the same functions using various third party apps. The most obvious use case here is understanding and clearing check engine codes, but these things give you access to pretty much all of the sensor data in your vehicle, at a much more granular level than you’d get from all of the symbols in your instrument cluster.

Beyond the standard $50 discounts you hear about in the middle of every podcast, Casper mattresses don’t go on sale often, and Casper accessory deals are even rarer. But this weekend only, Casper’s 10% Memorial Day sitewide sale holds the promise of serious savings, if you still haven’t gotten rid of that old coil spring. To get this deal, you have to buy a mattress (sorry, dog mattresses don’t count), so you can’t take advantage if you’re only shopping for accessories. But 10% savings on a standard Casper mattress works out to nearly $100 on a queen, or as much as $240 on the new, advanced Wave mattress. Just use promo code SUMMER10 at checkout to see the savings stack up. The best part of the deal is that any accessories you order at the same time will be discounted as well. I’m personally a huge fan of Casper’s pillow, but they make everything from adjustable bed frames to sheets to box springs, and unlike the mattresses, those are hardly ever eligible for discounts. You have until Memorial Day, so sleep on it if you must, but they don’t run sales like this often. Memorial Day weekend is coming up and that means pretty much everything on Wayfair is at least 50% off. You can get even bigger savings on living room furniture, wall art, lighting, kitchen &amp; dining room furniture, and more. They’ve rolled back the prices on select area rugs down to $50 and are running special discounts on Cuisinart kitchenware. So whatever your home needs, chances are Wayfair has it. The sale ends the 28th, so head over there and start shopping. Look around the garage at any mechanic, and there’s a good chance you’ll find a tub of Gojo pumice hand cleaner.

They’ll ship you two liters of the stuff for just $16. You love Lodge’s cast iron skillets, but have you tried their dutch oven? It’s only $32 on Amazon today, the best price in over a year. And while it’s an excellent dutch oven, its coolest feature is actually its lid. Just flip it over, and you’ve got yourself an extra cast iron skillet. That’s two great pieces of cookware for the price of one. While best known for its trash cans, simplehuman also makes the best shower caddies money can buy, and two of them are on sale for easily their best prices ever today, in addition to a triple soap pump. Simplehuman discounts are pretty rare, and when they do see them, they tend to be around 20%. But these deals are at least 40% off. Just place your orders before these deals go down the drain. Everyone ought to own a good old fashioned Swiss Army Knife, and the EvoGrip model is down to its best price ever right now.

Frederic Lardinois,"Yubico, the company behind the almost ubiquitous Yubikey two-factor authentication dongles, today announced that its YubiKey for Lightning is now in private preview. Once it is widely available, this will mark the first time the company offers a key that supports iPad and iPhone users. One nifty feature of the new key is that it has both USB-C and Lightning connectors — one on each side. Thanks to that, you’ll be able to use it on both moderns Macs and iPhones.
With this, Yubico is also announcing that it is extending its developer program to developers who want to use the company’s software tools for two-factor authentication to iOS developers.
“Yubicos goal is to make strong, simple authentication truly ubiquitous, across all services, devices, and operating systems, said the company’s CEO and founder Stina Ehrensvard in today’s announcement. Today at CES, we are excited to introduce the addition of NFC to our Security Key Series, and reveal our YubiKey for Lightning. These two products deliver on our mission to enable a passwordless future for all.
In addition to the new Lightning key, the company also today announced the launch of its new Security Key NFC, which supports authentication for FIDO2/WabAuthn and U2F services on computers and mobile devices with NFC support. The new key is basically a simplified consumer version of the standard YubiKey 5 devices. It’s now available for $27, compared to $45 for the black YubiKey 5. It’s still a pretty solid device, though, that’s manufactured in Sweden and the US.","Yubico, the company behind the almost ubiquitous Yubikey two-factor authentication dongles, today announced that its YubiKey for Lightning is now in private preview.

Two men were playing soccer in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park about 7:30 p.m. when they were hit, a police spokesman said. The two were taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center. One of the men, who is 30, was in critical condition; the other, 42, had non-life-threatening injuries.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright ESA/NASA Image caption The ISS provides a unqiue perspective on Earth's weather Thunderstorms are some of the most spectacular events in nature, yet what we can see from the surface of our planet is only the beginning. There are bizarre goings on in Earth's upper atmosphere, and a new mission aims to learn more about them. Launched to the International Space Station on Monday, the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) will observe the strange electrical phenomena that occur above thunderstorms. Sky lab Orbiting at an altitude of just over 400km, the ISS provides the perfect view of Earth's turbulent weather systems. ASIM will be deployed aboard the station later this month. Media caption A series of thunderstorms as seen from the ISS The electrifying effects of storms are frequently observed from the space station. Yet when lightning strikes downward, something very different is happening above the cloud tops. Known as Transient Luminous Events (TLEs), these unusual features were first spotted by accident in 1989. Minnesota professor John R Winckler was testing a television camera in advance of an upcoming rocket launch, when he realised that two frames showed bright columns of light above a distant storm cloud. Image copyright OTD/LIS, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Image caption Lightning strikes tend to concentrate over land masses The discovery came as a shock to scientists at the time, according to Dr Torsten Neubert, ASIM's lead scientist. ""That really surprised all of us. How come this exists and we didn't know it? Airline pilots must have known about it - there are some anecdotal descriptions,"" the Technical University of Denmark physicist said. For the better part of a century before TLEs were caught on camera, people who spotted them had been reporting ""rocket lightning"" or ""upward lightning"". Now in need of names, the phenomena were christened sprites and elves because of their fleeting, mysterious nature. Yet despite their diminutive monikers, these features are anything but small, and extend tens of kilometres into the atmosphere. Sprites, elves and jets So, what's causing these events? ""They are slightly different to lightning,"" Dr Neubert told BBC News. ""It's a pulse of the electric field that travels up. For the sprite - when the atmosphere gets thin, the field can get a discharge."" Sprites appear milliseconds after a powerful cloud-to-ground lightning strike. Elves, on the other hand, are caused by the electromagnetic pulse the strike produces. A brief, aurora-like expanding halo in the ionosphere, they occur too quickly to be spotted by the human eye and last less than a millisecond. Although they are more elusive, ""elves are incredibly well understood,"" says Dr Martin Fullekrug from the University of Bath. They are the most common TLE, thought to occur twice as often as sprites. Image copyright Jason Ahrns Image caption Sprites can last several milliseconds Blue jets - upward electrical discharges from cloud tops - are the least well known. ""The jets are not very well studied because they're very faint. They're mainly blue. Also they're not necessarily associated with lightning. They pop up now and again and they're very mysterious,"" Dr Fullekrug added. While elves are mainly spotted over warm ocean waters, sprites tend to occur over land. North America, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa are all good places to see them. Media caption ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen captured footage of rare blue jets from the ISS But it is possible to spot sprites elsewhere. A normal summer thunderstorm in the UK is about 10km wide. Sprites appear above mesoscale convective systems - storm complexes about 10 times larger. ""In Britain we also have [these storms] from time to time,"" explained Dr Fullekrug. ""We're conducting research on one that happened in May last year. It produced a wonderful sequence of sprites [over Cornwall]."" The sprites were spotted by meteor observers, who had cameras trained on the sky to follow the trails of shooting stars. Stormchasing from space ASIM's main goals are to study the physics of TLEs, and the characteristics of thunderstorms that produce them. The payload includes two cameras, which can capture 12 frames per second, plus X-ray and gamma ray detectors. This will allow the international team of researchers, for many of whom this is the culmination of decades of work, to determine where in the cloud sprites or jets originate. Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Sprites occur well above the cloud tops With the aid of the European Space Agency, ASIM's minimum mission length is two years. During this period, it is expected to observe a minimum of one TLE per day, although it is thought that they occur at least every minute, somewhere in the world. For Dr Neubert, this will be an incredibly exciting time. ""We don't really know what's inside lighting. It happens so fast and it's so dangerous... it's hard to get to the real inside physics,"" he said. In the thin upper atmosphere, TLEs are larger and easier to measure. ""To me,"" he added, ""they represent a window to the inside of lightning.""",A new mission aboard the International Space Station is taking storm chasing to new heights.,2018-04-06T23:18:45Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Hunting mysterious giant lightning from space,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43585113,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3194/production/_100729621_thunderstorm_seen_from_space_station.png,bbc-news,BBC News,lightning,1
Justin T. Westbrook,"Around six months ago, I really started dreading the sense that I would have to buy a new phone soon. The iPhone 7 Ive had in my pocket and hand for the last three years was beginning to have problems charging, and I could no longer use my Lightning connector headphones. It was really pissing me off.
I have absolutely zero desire to drop $1,000 on a new phone. Even if I wanted to, I hate the large size of the latest iPhones, and still havent gotten over Apple rolling everything into a solitary Lightning porteven three years later.
Everything I dislike about my phone is rooted in the Lightning port, so when it started acting up last year, my relationship with the most important device in my life became increasingly toxic. The first real hint that something was up was on a flight back from California to New York.
My laptop had died and there was no free in-flight entertainment, so my plan was to use my Apple Lightning earphones and just relax for the last few hours on the plane. To my horror, Ciaras One, Two Step came blasting out of the phone speakers, startling my row buddies, despite my earphones appearing to be plugged in.
After ten minutes of fidgeting, I gave up and took one of the worst naps Ive ever had. I havent enjoyed that song ever since. It even motivated me to flex on the casuals and buy AirPods.
Then the charging problems began. I would plug the cord in, it would signal that it was charging, and then as soon as I put the phone down, signal that it was unplugged. How irritating.
Over the months, I developed a strategy of either propping my phone up so that its weight kept the connector in contact, or an even more complicated process of charging a third-party battery case first, and then using that to charge my phone. It was needlessly stressful, but it prevented me from dropping a stack to replace an otherwise satisfactory phone.
That brings us to this morning. I woke up at 5:30 a.m. despite an alarm set for 7 a.m. Since I personally believe that going back to sleep in situations like this is detrimental, and the universe had awoken me for some purpose Ive yet to discover, I rolled over to check my phoneonly to find that it hadnt been charging overnight and had dropped under 20 percent.
Not a great start to the day! But this frustration motivated me to finally figure out what was happening with my Lightning port. I had an extra hour before work to spare, anyway.
For a while, I just sort of assumed the little bearings, or whatever you call them, inside the phones port were wearing down after years of use, and just not holding the connector in place. At one point a couple months ago, I even poked at the port with an extended paper clip, suspicious that something could be in there, but for whatever reason, that didnt work and I accepted that something else must be wrong.
But today, I held the ass of my phone up to the window light and saw a few flecks of color, a clear indication that something was wedged in there. In my questionable early-morning judgment, I grabbed the first hard, pointy object skinny enough to fit in the port I could think of: a fucking nail.
This all came out.
Im not saying Im any sort of genius, OK? I couldnt even troubleshoot lint in a hole for over six months and was this close to just throwing it out for a new phone. This entire experience has been extremely humbling.
But whatever, because it worked! Using the sharp tip, which uncomfortably scraped against the metal housing inside my phone, I slowly dragged out bundle after bundle of lint. There was so much lint. Three years of lint. It was like cleaning a forgotten belly button that had only been dressed in wool sweaters for three years.
I stood by the window, sticking this nail in my phone again and again for about a solid minute, my mouth agape as my false reality of perceived cleanliness crumbled before my eyes.
This is a good time to advise all of you that, if youre suddenly motivated to Marie Kondo your iPhone Lightning port, just take it to an Apple Care location where a coworker of mine reports they have a special brush specifically designed to clean out Lightning ports.
Even if you dont want to do that, finding something small and non-metal, like a wooden or plastic toothpick, is probably a much, much smarter thing to do.
After stepping off the emotional roller coaster of shock, then morbid self-reflection of my personal hygiene, and then the strange satisfaction of feeling these super-packed bundles of lint unfurling as I removed them from their very expensive cave, I ran over to my charging cable and enjoyed the first satisfying plug-snap Ive felt in over a year.
Reflecting on the lint situation, its not all that surprising how much was in there. My phone is always in my pocket with the hole exposedI believe in minimal-to-no casing for the smallest possible phone profileand when I charge it at night, its in my beda breeding ground of lint.
This is all to say, next time you are at the mall, or near an Apple Store, and have some time to kill, you should probably run in quickly and have them brush out your Lightning port. Just pray they dont judge you too harshly.
Never before have I better understood the mood of the existential beach cow in my phone background than I did this morning.","Around six months ago, I really started dreading the sense that I would have to buy a new phone soon.

ARIELLE DOLLINGER,"“Every nut ends up at Montauk Point,” Ms. Winski said. Once, about a decade ago, a car drove up behind her. Normally, she would turn after-hours visitors away, but there was “something about these people.” She invited the group in for a tour and up the 137 steps to the tower. It was the actress Nicole Kidman; the singer Keith Urban, her husband; and Ingrid Sischy, the Vanity Fair writer and critic. Leslee Dart, whose public relations firm represents Ms. Kidman, confirmed the outing. “I sort of knew who she was, but had no idea who he was,” Ms. Winski said. “He’s like, ‘Hi, I’m Keith.’ I’m like, ‘Good. I’m Marge.’” She searched for him online after he left. Ms. Winski, known as Marge, had become a lighthouse fixture. Mr. Osmers said, “Having Marge here was like having a well-fitting glove. It was just comfortable.” When Joseph Gaviola learned that Ms. Winski was moving out, he volunteered to move in. Mr. Gaviola, 63, a Montauk businessman and member of the lighthouse board, grew up on Long Island. “I look at it as an adventure; but, on the other hand, we have a National Historic Landmark, and we want and require somebody to be in attendance there,” Mr. Gaviola said. He plans to renovate the living space, he said, in part to create more closet space for his suits. “It’s going to be a learning curve for a while,” he said, of living in a public space. He is prepared.","As the lighthouse resident, Margaret A. Winski has watched her share of lightning storms and turned away gate jumpers at night.

David Murphy,"Today’s “I’ll believe it when I see it” iPhone rumor-mongering concerns not the iPhone itself, but its charger—the most important accessory you’ll find in its meticulously crafted packaging. As the speculation goes, Apple is allegedly considering bumping up the default charger for the iPhone 9 or iPhone X2: iPhones United (or whatever) from 5W to 18W. I’m skeptical, because I don’t think Apple gives two shits about helping its customers charge their devices faster—not when it can charge more for adapters that support faster charging speeds. After all, Apple could upgrade all of its iPhone’s chargers right now—tossing a speedier 12W charger in the box for the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, or iPhone X, for example. A 29W charger is the sweet spot for all three iPhones, but I doubt Apple would ever be that generous. This is the same company that demands an extra $20 for a different keyboard color, after all. If Apple proves me right—or if you’re just looking for a way to charge your iPhone even faster right now—let’s recap the basics: Which Apple power adapter should you get? If you’re apprehensive about buying any third-party charger—a justified fear, though you’ll probably be safer sticking with a reputable brand over an eBay knock-off—here’s what Apple offers: Apple 5W USB Power Adapter ($19) Comes in the box Requires a USB Type A to Lightning cable (comes in the box, too) Slowest possible charge for your iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X Don’t buy this (when Apple’s 12W USB Power Adapter costs the same amount) Apple 12W USB Power Adapter ($19) Should come in the box, but doesn’t (but does come with an iPad or iPad Pro) Requires a USB Type A to Lightning cable (comes in the box) Performs similarly to higher-watt chargers for the iPhone 8; slower for the iPhone 8 Plus; and slowest for the iPhone X (but still a lot faster than the 5W charger) The best budget charger you should buy from Apple 29W USB-C Power Adapter ($49) Doesn’t come with your iPhone, but does come with your standard-issue MacBook Requires a USB Type C to Lightning cable (not in the box; starts at $19 from Apple) Fastest charger for your iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X; more expensive chargers match it, but don’t beat it Buy this, even though you’ll spend nearly $70 to double your iPhone’s charging capabilities 61W USB-C Power Adapter ($69) This comes with your 13-inch MacBook Pro Requires a USB Type C to Lightning cable (not in the box; starts at $19 from Apple) Don’t buy this to charge your iPhone, because it’s not any faster than the 29W charger If you aren’t using it to charge your MacBook Pro, feel free to use it to charge your iPhone 87W USB-C Power Adapter ($79) This comes with your 15-inch MacBook Pro Requires a USB Type C to Lightning cable (not in the box; starts at $19 from Apple) You really, really shouldn’t buy this to charge your iPhone. You can use it to charge your iPhone, but it’s a wee overkill, no?

If you’ve upgraded your iPhone to iOS 11.2 —and there’s no reason not to, unless you have an older device that simply can’t —you’ll now be able to enjoy 7.5W wireless charging on your iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X. (That’s a 2.5W increase over pre-iOS 11.2 devices.) So, when you’re looking for a Qi-compatible wireless charger, make sure it can output at least 7.5W. You’ll probably be able to find a great one around the 9–10W range. You can always get a wireless charger that does more, but you’ll be future-proofing. Your iPhone can only charge so quickly, much like how plugging your device into a 87W USB-C Power Adapter won’t make it charge any faster than the 29W Power Adapter.","Today’s “I’ll believe it when I see it” iPhone rumor-mongering concerns not the iPhone itself, but its charger—the most important accessory you’ll find in its meticulously crafted packaging.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"There’s an eerie and incredibly rare phenomenon witnessed by few that has long puzzled scientists: ball lightning. These flashes, which typically appear in the evenings during thunderstorms and look like small, bright spheres, have gone mostly unexplained aside from some theories. But now, using some of the most mind-bending physics around, physicists think that they’ve recreated ball lightning, in miniature, in the lab, while at the same time observing a different physical phenomenon in its own right for the first time. What the scientists created is called the Shankar skyrmion, a three-dimensional, tangled, closed, synthetic magnetic field formed in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Bose-Einstein condensates are systems of atoms—in this case, rubidium atoms—near absolute zero. They’re able to demonstrate strange quantum effects on macroscopic scales, and they allow researchers to create otherwise impossible-to-study phenomena, like magnets with only one pole, supersolids, Rydberg polarons, and in this case, strange, knotted magnetic fields. And the authors, whose work appears today in Science Advances, are absolutely sure about what they’ve spotted. “That’s the great thing about these quantum gases—you can take photos of them and see the details of the structure,” study author Mikko Möttönen, from Aalto University in Finland, told Gizmodo. “We’re absolutely sure it’s the [three-dimensional] skyrmion that we’ve seen.” Aside from being a beautiful, tangled mess of atoms, the skyrmion quasiparticle is a really neat object because it seems to model the electric and magnetic fields of ball lightning. That was a surprise to the team. “The biggest moment was when we realized we got the same electromagnetic fields as predicted for ball lightning,” said Möttönen. “We didn’t aim for that. But wow.” To conduct this experiment, the scientists took advantage of the fact that particles have an innate property called spin, which makes them kind of like the smallest possible bar magnets. By applying an external magnetic field on a Bose-Einstein condensate, the researchers could arrange each of the rubidium atoms’ spins in a special configuration, so that they all face the same way along the surface of a ball, but twist in a peculiar way inside the ball. There are multiple possible configurations of the skyrmion allowed, so long as they follow two rules: Each magnetic field line is a circle and linked with every other line once, and if you follow circular paths that maintain the same spin direction inside of the skyrmion, the atom will twist twice. Basically, think of a magnetic field as a list of instructions at every point in space of where a magnetic thing will go, and an electric field as a similar list of where a charged particle will go. The skyrmion isn’t an intrinsic magnetic field, but a synthetic one based on the arrangement of the rubidium atoms that would take any particle on a twisted journey. It has an equally tangled electric field, and the particles clump to form complex structures in the gas. Other scientists I spoke with were impressed by the research. “It takes a lot of really incredible experimental engineering to be able to create these things,” said Azure Hansen, postdoctoral researcher at the National Institute for Standards and Technology. She was struck by the impressive match between theory and their observations. Bose-Einstein condensates are nearly macroscopic, and these systems expand from tens of micrometers to a hundred micrometers on each side. The scientists took pictures of the skyrmion’s shadows to confirm that it existed. More research on skyrmions could prove useful for other reasons than just modeling ball lightning, Hansen said. Since you can have lots of different skyrmion configurations so long as they obey the same rules, they’re topological objects. Topological objects are things that could morph into each other through squishing or stretching, while still retaining certain innate properties. Donuts and coffee mugs, for example, are the same topological object in that, if they were both made from clay, you could smush one form into the other and preserve the hole in the center. Because skyrmions stay skyrmions even when you squish and deform them, they could be useful for things like quantum computing, which requires maintaining a coherent quantum state despite jostling from the outside environment. Ultimately, the discovery itself is exciting. “We knew this was going to be a big result because it’s never been seen before,” said Möttönen, “but then on top, we got this analogy to the ball lightning—which was great.” [ Science Advances ]","There’s an eerie and incredibly rare phenomenon witnessed by few that has long puzzled scientists: ball lightning.

Noah Berlatsky,"2018 saw the release of a record-breaking number of major superhero films. That includes Avengers: Infinity War, the first superhero film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide, and Black Panther, which grossed $1.34 billion, making it the fourth highest-earning superhero film ever. It was a year in which superheroes triumphed — but it was, also, unfortunately a year in which ugly political realities made most superhero fantasies seem increasingly strained and irrelevant. The superhero genre is clearly one of the major draws for moviegoers at the moment. But it feels less and less like what we need as a culture. Superheroes have always been political. Colorful figures in tights were beating the tar out of the Nazis long before America was ready to face that conflict in the real world. Faced with a looming global threat, Americans during World War II flocked to pick up stories of star-spangled heroes like Wonder Woman and Captain America, who thumped Axis agents (and Hitler himself !) while spreading the gospel of justice and righteous empowerment. Our current superhero moment was inspired by a similar dynamic. After the 9/11 attacks, Americans who felt scared and powerless naturally turned to empowerment fantasies. Mired in a seemingly endless war on terror, audiences once again rushed to narratives of noble, powerful people using their amazing powers to right the world’s wrongs. The number of superhero films began to expand, Hulk-like, in the early 2000s, and the trend continues booming. In 2018, so much superhero product was released, it’s almost impossible to list it all. Theaters saw blockbuster business around Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Venom, Deadpool 2, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Aquaman, and Incredibles 2. Then there are the television series: Legion, Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, Supergirl, Flash, Arrow, Legends of Tomorrow, Black Lightning, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Cloak & Dagger, Runaways, Krypton, Titans, Young Justice, and on and on. The glut of superhero stories has led to surprising mutations. In every sense, superheroes on screen are more diverse than ever before. Legion turns the genre into psychological horror. Deadpool 2 uses superheroes for gross-out comedy. Incredibles 2 is a family sitcom, Runaways is high-school melodrama, Venom is horror/comedy. Changes in the genre have also meant a greater diversity of people who get to be empowered — and a greater acknowledgement of different kinds of injustice. In a year when Trump and the Republican party spouted constantly escalating hateful rhetoric about the dangers of people of color crossing America’s borders, the superhero genre responded by embracing a growing wave of non-white and non-male heroes. In Iron Fist, an Asian woman replaced the white guy in the title role. Black Panther presented an extended critique of American racism, and cast a black foreign power as the hope of the world. Into the Spider-Verse openly stated, “Anyone can be Spider-Man”; the main character in the story is a mixed-race teenager who inherits the Spider-Man costume and powers. Photo: Sony Pictures Entertainment But in spite of these advances, the superhero genre in 2018 still seemed oddly disconnected from the realities of 2018. Superhero stories are all about defeating evil, but the kind of evils they tend to focus on — most often, superpowered criminals, leaders, and invaders — aren’t the evils that seem most pressing right at the moment. Superhero stories often have political themes — Aquaman and Infinity War both confusedly address environmental concerns, for example, and Black Panther is admirably frank about racism, poverty, and inequality. But superheroes struggle to address the political ascendancy of reactionary authoritarianism. That’s in large part because superheroes are traditionally conservative and elitist. The superhero genre has always had a strong bias toward defending the status quo. It’s no coincidence that the genre reaches its peaks of popularity during times when the culture is focused on the spectre of rising threats from abroad. Superheroes are almost always dedicated to stopping someone bad from changing things, not changing things that are already bad. Tony Stark’s amazing technological advances are used to beat the tar out of alien invaders and protect the world, but not to end world hunger or forge peace in the Middle East. Great power is used to protect the world, not revolutionize it. In fact, in superhero narratives, the revolutionaries are almost always the villains. Erik Killmonger in Black Panther wants a world-wide anti-racist revolution. Thanos in Infinity War believes radical steps are necessary to prevent ecological collapse. The villain in Venom decides to ally with human-devouring space aliens in the name of environmentalism. King Orm in Aquaman is building an undersea coalition to fight back against humanity’s pollution of the seas. All these antagonists are somewhat sympathetic, but their desire for meaningful change in the face of real problems is presented as leading inevitably to mass murder and genocide. Even criminal reform gets short shrift in Daredevil season 3, in which the evil imprisoned villain pretends to have a change of heart. He fools some bleeding-heart liberals, maybe, but not the hero. (Ant-Man is an ex-con—but the narrative goes out of its way to show that he was always a good guy who never really should have been in prison in the first place.) Image: Marvel Studios The superhero genre’s super-skepticism about radical beneficial change is complemented by a super-skepticism about collective action. The whole point of the genre is that some people have great powers — and some people don’t. Those who do are the heroes. Those who don’t are romantic interests, bystanders, and potential victims. The story isn’t about them. Change comes about not through community action or political efforts, but through the outsize actions of special, strong saviors. In season 2 of Luke Cage, for example, Luke’s community is racked by violence and gang wars. His solution is to become a gang lord himself, essentially imposing a benevolent dictatorship on his neighborhood. This decision is presented as a personally damaging but effective sacrifice; community action isn’t even considered. Crime calls for a tough law-and-order response that cracks down on even non-criminals. Trump — who has called for unconstitutional “stop and frisk” policies to curb gun violence in Chicago — would approve. The conservatism and elitism of the superhero genre is most starkly revealed when a superhero story rejects conservatism and elitism — and in the process, stops being a superhero story. The oddest, most adventurous “superhero” film of 2018 was probably Sorry To Bother You. Boots Riley’s film is about a broke, shy black man, Cash Green (Lakeith Stanfield) who gains the ability to talk with a smarmy “white voice,” transforming himself into a super-telemarketer. Green has special, magical abilities, but they don’t make him strong or noble. They just enrich him personally, and turn him into a jerk. It’s only when he sets aside his individual talents and joins with his fellow workers in a labor action that he’s meaningfully on the side of good. Photo courtesy of Annapurna Pictures Superheroes, Sorry To Bother You suggests, are scabs who enforce a corrupt status quo. A narrative about special powers can’t be a narrative about solidarity, and a narrative that isn’t about solidarity can’t really be a narrative about change, justice, or hope. There’s no sign that Boots Riley’s insights are going to be taken to heart. There’s already a slate of superhero narratives scheduled for 2019, including the MCU’s Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel, DC’s light-hearted Shazam!, the X-Men spinoffs Dark Phoenix and The New Mutants, and outliers like M. Night Shyamalan’s Glass and Spider-Man: Far From Home. Some will be good, some will be mediocre, and some will continue to push at the edges of the genre’s possibilities. That’s not a bad thing in itself. It’s understandable that in a time of political division, anger, and complexity, people wish for magical abilities to allow them to get above it all. There’s nothing innately wrong with imagining that you can fly. It’s not the best time, though, to be imagining, so obsessively, in film after film and television show after television show, that everyone else is stuck on the ground.","Superhero stories are big, booming business, and they’re coming out at a record-breaking rate, with films like Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War dominating the box office, and shows from Daredevil to Supergirl to Black Lightning taking over TV.

JIM TANKERSLEY and ALAN RAPPEPORT,"Photo With Republicans intent on passing a tax overhaul along party lines, public protests have been Democrats’ only weapon throughout the lightning-fast progression of the bill. Credit Justin Gilliland for The New York Times WASHINGTON — By midafternoon on Friday, Republicans had the votes to pass their tax bill in the Senate. What they did not have was a bill. The legislation, covering nearly 500 pages, finally surfaced well after the sun had set. It appeared first in the lobbying shops of K Street, which sent back copies to some Democrats in the Senate, who took to social media to protest being asked to vote in a matter of hours on a bill that had yet to be shared with them directly. The drafts that leaked to journalists included changes scrawled in looping handwriting in the margins. Democrats posted screenshots and accompanying complaints. Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, called it “Washington D.C. at its worst” in a video in which he held up a page of the bill with the changes. “This is unbelievable, we’re doing massive tax reform on an absolute incredible timeline,” he said. “This is going to affect everybody in this country.” I was just handed a 479-page tax bill a few hours before the vote. One page literally has hand scribbled policy changes on it that can’t be read. This is Washington, D.C. at its worst.

The minority party has no ability to stop the bill, because Republicans are employing a Senate tactic that allows them to bypass a Democratic filibuster. The first version of the tax plan was introduced in the House on Nov. 1 and approved two weeks later; the Senate is on course to match that pace. That would be a compressed schedule in any event, but it was particularly so on Friday, as Republicans inserted several last-second amendments to secure majority support for their bill. Democrats could only scold and work up a frenzy on social media. Photo Some senators began sharing images of the legislation, which included handwritten additions along the margins. In a separate video, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, held up a stack of legislative text and tried to read the changes that the Republicans had made. She struggled to make sense of the garbled language and lamented that she could not possibly read the bill in the hour or so before the expected vote.

Ron Miller,"Salesforce has been talking about the Internet of Things for some time as a way to empower field service workers. Today, the company announced Field Service Lightning, a new component designed to deliver automated IoT data to service technicians in the field on their mobile devices. Once you connect sensors in the field to Service Cloud, you can make this information available in an automated fashion to human customer service agents and pull in other data about the customer from Salesforce’s CRM system to give the CSR a more complete picture of the customer. “Drawing on IoT signals surfaced in the Service Cloud console, agents can gauge whether device failure is imminent, quickly determine the source of the problem (often before the customer is even aware a problem exists) and dispatch the right mobile worker with the right skill set,” Salesforce’s SVP and GM for Salesforce Field Service Lightning Paolo Bergamo wrote in a blog post introducing the new feature. The field service industry has been talking for years about using IoT data from the field to deliver more proactive service and automate the customer service and repair process. That’s precisely what this new feature is designed to do. Let’s say you have a “smart home” with a heating and cooling system that can transmit data to the company that installed your equipment. With a system like this in place, the sensors could tell your HVAC dealer that a part is ready to break down and automatically start a repair process (that would presumably include calling the customer to tell them about it). When a CSR determines a repair visit is required, the repair technician would receive all the details on their smart phone. Customer Service Console view. Gif: Salesforce It also could provide a smoother experience because the repair technician can prepare before he or she leaves for the visit with the right equipment and parts for the job and a better understanding of what needs to be done before arriving at the customer location. This should theoretically lead to more efficient service calls. All of this is in line with a vision the field service industry has been talking about for some time that you could sell a subscription to a device like an air conditioning system instead of the device itself. This would mean that the dealer would be responsible for keeping it up and running and having access to data like this could help that vision to become closer to reality. In reality, most companies are probably not ready to implement a system like this and most equipment in the field has not been fitted with sensors to deliver this information to the Service Cloud. Still, companies like Salesforce, ServiceNow and ServiceMax (owned by GE) want to release products like this for early adopters and to have something in place as more companies look to put smarter systems in place in the field.","Salesforce has been talking about the Internet of Things for some time as a way to empower field service workers.

Patrick Allan,"The goal of brainstorming is to find possible solutions to a problem, but the process often becomes a platform for the outspoken, who offer the same perspective time and time again. Instead: ask everyone to generate more questions about the problem so you get a better understanding of what it really is. This counterintuitive method from Hal Gregersen, the executive director of the MIT Leadership Center, gets everyone thinking and participating, and can turn a lackluster brainstorming session into something far more effective. Over dinner a couple months ago, one of my friends said he needed some help coming up with a name… Read more Read According to Gregersen, brainstorming for answers can manifest a destructive group dynamic that kills creativity and stifles participation. Coming up with answers is hard, after all, and nobody wants to seem stupid, so people end up keeping their ideas to themselves. But when you brainstorm for questions instead, you can take a deeper look at problems and give the opportunity for your fellow stormers to offer fresh perspectives on the matter. Here’s how Gergersen does it: 1. Set the stage : Select a problem, invite a small group to help you consider it from different angles, and describe it in broad-brush fashion so you don’t limit the group’s thinking. 2. Generate only questions about the challenge : Redirect anyone who suggests solutions, and explain that no lengthy preambles or justifications are allowed. Go for quantity and speed with the questions. That will open up new pathways to understanding or addressing the problem. 3. Pursue at least one of those pathways : Devise a near-term action plan to keep the momentum going. Asking questions is much easier than trying to come up with answers, so more people will participate. As the session goes on, people’s questions might spark someone’s genius and create answers that weren’t there before. In a normal brainstorming session, you’re waiting around for lightning to strike. Why not create more storm clouds, and thus more opportunities for that lightning?

Vlad Savov,"The Google branding is just a sticker on the packaging of existing products When Google sliced the headphone jack off from its 2017 generation of Pixel phones, the move was commonly defended by reference to a false equivalence between the iPhone and the latest Pixels. If Apple can go jack-less, went the reasoning, why not Google too? Well, Apple’s iPhone happens to have the best-developed third-party ecosystem of bespoke peripherals and accessories, and today some of the leading audio companies have iPhone-specific, Lightning-connected headphones. Audeze, Shure, Bowers & Wilkins, and a number of others have introduced Lightning audio cables and Lightning versions of their best portable headphones. Google’s preferred USB-C, on the other hand, is a relative wasteland. Libratone is an interesting Danish company that lands smack in the middle of this Apple-Google dichotomy. In September of 2016, Libratone joined the growing list of companies with Lightning headphones by launching its Q Adapt Lightning earphones with built-in noise cancelling. At the time, I asked the company whether it would do a USB-C version, and was treated to a horror story about the inconsistency of USB-C implementations across phone manufacturers and the dreadful difficulty of making a pair of headphones compatible with every USB-C device on the market. The whole notion that I had in my mind — of Android devices outselling iPhones in most places around the globe and therefore making USB-C more appealing than Lightning — seemed to be crumbling. The workaround that Libratone chose for Android’s chronic fragmentation was to work with just one company, signing up to be among Google’s first “ Made for Google ” peripheral-making partners. That’s how the $149 USB-C version of the Q Adapt earphones came to be. Carrying the Google sticker meant Libratone had to only ensure compatibility with one family of phones: Google’s Pixels. The larger and pricier ($249) Q Adapt on-ear headphones, on the other hand, have practically no Google affinity to speak of; they’re just wireless Bluetooth headphones that also have the “Made for Google” sticker on their box. (Aside: I’m really bothered by this sticker. If either pair of headphones were “Made for Google,” shouldn’t that be reflected in the actual packaging? By its transient nature, the sticker betrays the fact that the “Made for Google” idea was an afterthought). The dearth of USB-C earphones means that the USB-C Q Adapt are practically in a field of their own. My colleague Helen Havlak had an exasperating struggle trying to find a pair for her Pixel 2, and the responses to my tweet below also illustrate the unfulfilled need. USB-C earphones: do they exist? Asking for many friends. If you make them and think they're good, I'll prioritise them for review. — Vlad Savov (@vladsavov) October 26, 2017 It’s a good thing, then, that the Libratone Q Adapt earphones sound quite terrific. Granted, I didn’t have the highest expectations from a company with no competition, but Libratone has really crafted a pair of highly entertaining, pleasing earphones — which just happen to connect via USB-C rather than the traditional headphone port. The Q Adapt’s bass is satisfyingly deep and anchors everything nicely, with the rest of the presentation retaining clarity and definition even with the bass bump. I enjoy my music through these earphones, even if they don’t have the widest soundstage or the most refined and precise audio response. They sound good enough for me, and I’m habituated to reviewing $1,500 cans like the Focal Clear. The USB-C connection helps Libratone port over one of the unique Q Adapt features from the Lightning version of these earphones: adaptive noise cancelling. There are various levels of intensity for it, and you can toggle between them with a dedicated key on the in-line remote control. I find each setting actually alters the sound produced by the Q Adapt quite substantially, so you’re not simply choosing how much external sound to let in: you’re also choosing between varieties of tuning. Without USB-C, this feature would have required batteries inside the earphones, but Libratone’s able to get noise cancelling done with just the power it draws from the phone, which is a nice efficiency win and saves you having to worry about charging. Between the USB-C plug and the rather long in-line remote, the Q Adapt’s cable is covered in a nice braided fabric, and then after the Y-splitter it’s a relatively thin plastic culminating in the polished plastic ear buds. I find these earphones easy to put on, wear, and remove, and I find that ease of use a big attraction when paired with the friendly sound tuning. Nothing here is groundbreaking or setting new heights of excellence, but everything is done to a high enough level to justify the $149 price tag. One problem that the Q Adapt earphones do have, though: you have no idea which USB-C device they’ll be compatible with and to what extent. Take smartphones as the obvious example: the Google Pixel 2 and 2 XL work with it perfectly, of course, and so do the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 and the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. But the OnePlus 5T? Nothing. It’s like I haven’t plugged anything into it at all. When I connect the Q Adapt in-ears to my MacBook Pro, they play very nicely, but I can’t use their remote control to pause the music I’m listening to or adjust its volume. On the Mac, only software-based volume controls — such as the volume slider in Spotify or iTunes — can tweak the sound output of the Q Adapt earphones. Turning to the Q Adapt on-ears, I find there’s much less excitement and interest to convey. The cynical branding exercise is perfectly obvious here, as these headphones don’t even use a USB-C port to charge; they’re still stuck on the old and busted MicroUSB. Libratone could have used USB-C to charge the Q Adapt on-ears and also receive a digital music signal, much as Bowers & Wilkins does with its own wireless PX headphones. The USB-C connection on the PX delivers a slightly better sound quality than the wireless alternative. But nope, Libratone just slapped that Google sticker on its box. I can heartily commend the Q Adapt on-ear headphones for their comfort and lightness. They are featherlight but steady on my head, and they make a nice neck decoration when I don’t want to listen to them. It would have been nice if they could contract down to a smaller shape, though. As the name suggests, this pair of cans shares in the adaptive noise cancelling tech of its in-ear siblings, and I appreciate it just as much here. Where the on-ear Q Adapt differs, though, is that it doesn’t sound anywhere near as good as the USB-C version. The heft of the in-ear Q Adapt’s bass is missing, and the on-ear headphones just sound a whole lot more digital and less convincing. I find the artificiality of their sound distracting, and I find myself avoiding them. Two other important downsides to the Q Adapt on-ears: The Libratone logo on the right ear cup continually glows while they’re active, and that glow is too bright and just plain annoying. And the battery is not particularly impressive. Libratone promises 20 hours of battery life, but I get down to a 60-percent charge within just a couple of hours of listening and have found myself recharging them even without any epic music marathons (which these headphones’ sound is never good enough to justify). As far as Android compatibility goes, there’s nothing additional or special to these Bluetooth Q Adapt on-ears. On a Pixel 2, you can see the battery level of the headphones, but that’s pretty much a universal feature in modern platform-agnostic wireless headphones like the B&W PX too. All in all, the Q Adapt on-ears are just overpriced Bluetooth headphones that Google is selling in order to flesh out its online peripherals store. That’s my best guess, anyway. Libratone’s achievement with the Q Adapt in-ears shouldn’t be underestimated. The company took a successful new product in its Lightning-based earphones, and it successfully transposed it to the Android realm of USB-C. No, the Q Adapt USB-C buds aren’t compatible with every USB-C phone, and that’s a problem, and they also cost $30 more than the now-discounted Q Adapt Lightning model. But even at $149, these are comfortable, good-sounding earphones that are difficult to criticize. If you’re buying a Pixel or any other USB-C phone without a headphone jack of its own, I recommend these as an essential accessory. I just hope their price comes down to more reasonable levels soon. The Q Adapt on-ear headphones, on the other hand, are hard to rationally justify. Yes, they’re comfy and stylish. But they cost more than the excellent Sony 1000X, which are now at $229, and do absolutely nothing better. These are utterly forgettable Bluetooth headphones that have gained a bit of notoriety by virtue of Google’s endorsement.

Ed Cara,"It’s the sort of story that you’d find in a Marvel movie, but with far less cool consequences. Doctors in Slovenia have reported what they say is the first instance of lightning shutting down a person’s brain implant. The bizarre case, detailed in the Journal of Neurosurgery, concerned a 66-year-old woman with an implantable pulse generator (IPG). IPGs are portable devices that send periodic shocks to the brain to help re-stabilize its neural activity—a technique known as deep brain stimulation. The women’s IPG had successfully tamped down her neck dystonia, also known as uncontrollable neck spasms, for five years. During a particularly stormy day, though, her apartment was struck by lightning. And along with destroying her plugged-in air conditioner and television, the strike turned off the women’s IPG. It wasn’t until her tremors returned a hour after the storm had ended that she realized something was wrong. Thankfully, once she visited an outpatient clinic and had the device checked out, it was found to be perfectly unharmed. And after she turned back it on, the neck spasms went back under control, and she suffered no further harm. As far as the doctors can tell, the lightning had generated a large electromagnetic field (EMF). And since the women’s device had a safety system that detects EMFs (they’re known to interfere with IPG function), it automatically turned itself off. But though the woman escaped unscathed, things could have gone way worse. The device is charged by a pad that itself is charged through a typical plug into an outlet. But the device can be charged at the same time as the pad is charging—the person simply holds the pad against their head while it is plugged in. If the lightning had struck then, there’s no telling how dangerous it could have been for the woman. The doctors behind the report say the best possible way to prevent these sort of freak accidents from happening should be pretty simple. For one, chargers should be connected to a surge protector, and they should be charged separately from the device itself. “Last, we propose that in the future [deep brain stimulation] manufacturers’ safety recommendations should specifically mention the possibility of hazards from naturally generated electromagnetic interference, such as during thunderstorms,” the authors write.

Aaron Souppouris,"Audeze isn't the first company to release such an attachment -- Shure has a pendant that lets its IEMs work wirelessly -- but Audeze's approach here is neat nonetheless. The new cable is short, and is intended to hook around the back of your neck. It has two modules attached, which rest a couple of inches below your ear on both sides. One module houses the DAC, controls, Bluetooth receiver and a Micro-USB charging port, while the other is taken up entirely by a battery. The result is a design that, once connected to the headphones, looks like they've always been this way, rather than a retrofitted mess.

Stan Schroeder,"Dongle hell might finally be getting a little better next year. According to a new report from DigiTimes, Apple is planning to replace its proprietary Lightning connector with the more widely used USB-C connector on the iPhone and iPad next year. SEE ALSO: Apple to use OLED for all iPhones in 2019, report claims Citing sources from Apple's supply chain, Digitimes says previous rumors that this would happen this year are incorrect, as Apple is still in ""redesign phase"" and will not be able to make the switch until 2019. Digitimes has a spotty record when it comes to accuracy of its Apple-related rumors, but this one actually makes a lot of sense. A report in May claimed that Apple will start shipping iPhones with a faster, USB-C charger and a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box. From there, switching to USB-C completely is the logical step for several reasons. First, everyone else is using it. Second, Apple itself is using solely USB-C ports on its new MacBooks and MacBook Pros. That means you can connect a newer Android phone directly to a MacBook, but you need a converter to connect an iPhone to a MacBook, which is beyond ridiculous. Finally, the port itself is getting less important now that the iPhone X (and, presumably, its successors) is equipped with wireless charging. Perhaps one day we'll see an iPhone with no charging port at all, though that's still wishful thinking at this stage. Apple's Lightning port is a bit thinner than USB-C, and possibly easier to waterproof, which might make Apple reluctant to make the switch. But there are many thin and waterproof Android phones with a USB-C connector around, so these potential issues shouldn't be deal-breakers. And yes, iPhone and iPad users are used to the Lightning port. But now that newer MacBooks have gone USB-C only, I bet most of them wouldn't mind the switch. Keep in mind that we're fully in rumor territory here, and 2019 iPhones are likely more than a year away. This year, Apple is rumored to launch three new iPhones — a 5.8-inch, 6.1-inch and a 6.5-inch variant — with two or even all three sporting OLED screens similar to the screen on iPhone X.","Dongle hell might finally be getting a little better next year.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"When you think of an alien world, you might think of a strange, stormy place with an inhospitable environment, frequent lightning strikes, and extreme radiation. But who needs an imagination when the storms here on Earth already beam radiation, including antimatter, down toward the ground? Hurricane Patricia in 2015 was the second most intense tropical cyclone ever on record, traveling up the Pacific coast of Mexico with winds topping out at 215 miles-per-hour. Despite the fierce conditions, scientists still had science to do, and they flew in a plane through its eyewall on October 23, 2015. The plane’s instruments measured gamma-rays blasted from lightning inside the hurricane, as well as what seemed to be beam of positrons, the antimatter opposite of electrons. Events like these are probably more common than you’d think. “These terrestrial gamma-ray flashes can happen in any storm that makes lightning,” David Smith, one of the study’s authors from the University of California, Santa Cruz, told Gizmodo. The detector onboard the plane measured a phenomenon that scientists have been interested in for decades: terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. It’s unclear exactly how it happens, but lightning in storms seems to accelerate electrons to nearly light speed. These electrons collide with the particles in the atmosphere, resulting in high-energy x-rays and gamma rays that scientists have measured in satellites and on the ground. The rays could also result from collisions between electrons and their antimatter partners, positrons. The team behind the newest paper had a tool called the Airborne Detector for Energetic Lightning Emissions (ADELE) on board a hurricane-hunting WP-3D plane, according to the paper published recently in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres. It was a very simple radiation-detecting experiment: two pieces of plastic and one special kind of crystal, all called scintillators, that flash when a high-energy particle hits them. An instrument called a photomultiplier tube turns the flashes into signals that a computer or oscilloscope can read. There was also a radio-wave detector. The scintillators flashed 184 times in the split-second following a lightning bolt in Hurricane Patricia’s eyewall. Based on their modeling, the signal matched what a downward beam of positrons would look like—meaning they didn’t measure positrons directly. This is the first time such an effect has been measured in a hurricane’s eyewall, though it’s been known to happen in lots of different kinds of storms. And no, the positrons aren’t anything to worry about, since you’re probably already being struck by lightning. Positrons are a typical byproduct of certain radioactive sources, and their numbers drop off precipitously with distance. Still, said Smith, if you were in a plane at the exact unluckiest place at unluckiest time (higher than their experimental plane flew) you night receive a deadly dose of radiation. Most interesting to Smith was the mystery of why these wild events happen when and how they do. “From a scientific perspective, this is an exotic phenomenon and there’s a lot we don’t understand, like why it is as bright as it is and why it happens sometimes but not others,” he said. “We’re trying to understand whatever phenomenon nature throws at us.” [ JGR Atmospheres ]","When you think of an alien world, you might think of a strange, stormy place with an inhospitable environment, frequent lightning strikes, and extreme radiation.

Proma Khosla,"At some point in the young progressive's education, you realize that the word ""normal"" is code for ""straight and white."" Everything else — foreign cinema, LGBTQ romance, minority-led TV and films, etc. — must be explicitly labeled for its otherness. So it should come as no surprise that the CW's new drama Black Lightning is being marketed to television viewers for, well, it's blackness. But for the CW and Black Lightning, the challenge to provide representation for a whole community is a badge of honor and crucial part of the show. And it tackles that challenge head on, and does so much more. Black Lightning is the first black-led superhero show in the CW's extensive DC lineup, and it embraces every part of its identity, wearing its otherness proudly and painlessly. This is a show for the people who don't see themselves in the habitually straight Avengers movies or on White Arrow, White Flash, or White Supergirl. SEE ALSO: A lot of kids are going to see 'Black Panther' thanks to this GoFundMe Black Lightning opens on the south side of Metropolis, an area facing Gotham-levels of rising crime nine years after the titular hero mysteriously vanished. His true identity is Jefferson Pierce (Cress Williams), who's now a local high school principal and father of two. His daughters are now old enough to see the world for its moral shades of grey and do things like protest the city's gang violence and how law enforcement handles it. The latter would be his older daughter, Anissa (Nafessa Williams), whose sibling affectionately calls her Harriet Tubman. Young Jennifer (China Anne McClain), on the other hand, is more of a rebel (not least because her father is her high school principal). Image: Mark Hill/The CW This is a show about people with supernatural abilities, but it is far and away more prominently a show about people who have been marginalized and abused by systems of power and who are fighting to reclaim the narrative of their own lives. It's clear from their first conversation that Pierce has been raising his girls right. He quotes Dr. King's "" Where do we go from here? "" to Anissa when chiding her for being arrested: ""Returning violence for violence multiplies violence adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars."" And then Anissa (who's gay, by the way, and her parents couldn't care less) bites back with Fannie Lou Harner : ""I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired."" It seems like a heavy-handed expository exchange for a show touting the CW's first black superhero, but it doesn't feel forced. Nor does the next moment, when Pierce and his daughters are pulled over by white cops, in a scene that feels incredibly realistic. Furious at the injustice, Pierce's eyes start to glow. The cop car's lights flicker and extinguish, but after a deep breath Pierce comes back to himself and the lights return. Black Lightning is awake. The greatest enemy of Black Lightning and his city is a gang called the 100 (not to be confused with The 100 ), and Jennifer ends up tangled up in their business within the first episode. As a result, there is more hand-to-hand combat and gun violence in the first two episodes than there are special effects or bursts of light. To that end, Black Lightning is violent in a way that CW superhero shows emphatically aren't. After rescuing Jennifer from a seedy night club, Pierce gets stopped by the police once again. He then goes into what we must assume is called Lightning Mode and absorbs the energy of the cops' tasers, which effectively charge him up so he can blow up their car with a flick of his hand (cue aforementioned bursts of light). The 100 abducts both Pierce daughters from school in broad daylight, which is what finally coaxes Lightning out of retirement. He walks purposefully to meet Gambi (James Remar), his Alfred, accompanied by music almost blatantly evocative of the Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight movies. He saves the girls in a swagged out new suit and brings them home in a tearful family reunion. Part of the drama of the show is whether Black Lightning is back or not, and it's clear that Pierce himself doesn't know the answer. He's hurt, he feels threatened, and if he marks his return, there's no guarantee that the 100 won't come for his family again while ruthlessly tearing the community asunder. At times the show is too real, too important, as with the mother in seeking to avenge her daughter and wearing that daughter's face on a t-shirt like so many mothers who have lost their children to violence against black people. Image: Richard Ducree/The CW Pierce's wife (from whom he's separated) describes Lightning as an addiction. That's damning, but she's a neuroscientist; the electric currents and adrenaline rush of being Black Lightning could easily mirror addictive effects of drug use with its highs and lows. In contrast, Gambi compares Pierce to a lion in a cage and that the real addiction was to his wife (love is a drug!). The best part of Black Lightning sneaks up at the end of both episodes: Anissa. The kidnapping triggers something in Jefferson's older daughter, much like trauma catalyzes the mutation lying dormant in teenagers of the X-Men universe. In moments of high stress – like Molly on Marvel's Runaways – Anissa exhibits super strength, and at the end of episode 2, she uses it. Instead of shock or fear, she greets her abilities with a satisfied smile – perhaps even a slight emotional high. Episode 2 ends with a queer woman of color using superpowers on an assailant, as fervently resonant as the bulletproof Luke Cage sauntering through Harlem in 2016. So yes, this is a show about people with supernatural abilities, but it is far and away more prominently a show about people who have been marginalized and abused by systems of power and who are fighting to reclaim the narrative of their own lives. This is a show about Anissa and Jennifer breaking out of their father's shadow and honoring his legacy.

Monica Chin,"Apple is doubling down on your security. The company has seeded the fourth beta of its upcoming iOS 11.4 update to developers, and it contains an intriguing new feature called ""USB Restricted Mode."" SEE ALSO: Tim Cook: People don't want iOS and MacOS merged The feature, spotted by ElcomSoft, will restrict your phone's Lightning port so it can be used only for charging if the device isn't unlocked, or connected to a paired and ""trusted"" computer. The feature will automatically disable the port's data connection if you haven't used it in a week. The developer notes make this clear: To improve security, for a locked iOS device to communicate with USB accessories you must connect an accessory via Lightning connector to the device while unlocked — or enter your device passcode while connected at least once a week. USB Restricted Mode won't prevent hackers or law enforcement from accessing your phone's data through the lightning port, but it will severely limit the time they have to do so. In particular, it could hinder tools such as the infamous GrayKey, which law enforcement agencies across the country are using to penetrate locked iPhones. GrayKey devices can take three days or longer to crack a six-digit passcode. USB Restricted Mode was first sighted in the beta of iOS 11.3, but it wasn't in the final release, so it still remains to be seen if the official launch of iOS 11.4 will include the feature. That said, earlier iOS 11 releases have been riddled with frustrating bugs, from disabling microphones and wrecking battery life to dangerous security vulnerabilities. It'll be nice if iOS 11.4 brings us a feature that's actually helpful, especially in keeping our data safe. We've contacted Apple for comment and will update this story if we hear back.","Apple is doubling down on your security.

Sarah Perez,"Real estate investor and Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik has expanded his relationship with Dreamit Ventures through a new $12 million investment into the early stage fund and accelerator, announced earlier this week. The deal will also see Vinik joining Dreamit as a Partner and a member of the Board of Directors. Vinik was already partnered with Dreamit in a formal capacity prior to this investment. In 2016, he worked with Dreamit to launch its UrbanTech hybrid accelerator in Tampa. Unlike some startup incubators, the “hybrid” means startups aren’t required to relocate to Tampa during the entire 14-week program. Instead, it offers a briefer period where companies can get familiar with the area, and pitch their startup to local companies. The debut cohort included companies focused on diverse areas ranging from water sensors to smart speed bumps to electric bikes to micro wind turbines and more. Vinik had already invested an undisclosed, smaller amount in Dreamit to aid with the launch of UrbanTech, according to the Tampa Bay Times. The accelerator is also tied to the $3 billion Water Street Tampa redevelopment project backed by both Vinik and Cascade Investment, Bill Gates’ private investment fund. While the 50-acre waterfront redevelopment project aims to bring in new residences, businesses, restaurants, hotels, shops, and more, a big part of Vinik’s vision for the Tampa Bay area includes attracting new technology investment and entrepreneurship to the area, too. “Over the last year, my partnership with Dreamit has helped us identify emerging technologies and bridge the funding and resource gap between Tampa Bay and larger startup ecosystems like New York and San Francisco. I’ve been highly impressed by Dreamit’s team, the caliber of Dreamit startups, and the large percentage of companies that continue growing with follow-on funding after the program,” said Vinik, in reference to his Dreamit investment. Of course, Vinik aslo sees an opportunity in connecting the UrbanTech startups with the bigger companies who will be building in Tampa as a result of the real estate project; so investing into Dreamit makes sense, given those aligned goals. Vinik’s involvement in Dreamit could be a boost for the accelerator, as well, thanks to Vinik’s connections not only as a result of his real estate investments, but also those forged in his earlier days managing the Fidelity Magellan Fund and his own hedge fund, Vinik Asset Management. Since its founding in 2008, Dreamit has backed nearly 300 startups including SeatGeek, HouseParty, LevelUp, Adaptly, Wellth, Biomeme, Tissue Analytics, Redox, Eko Devices, Raxar, and Elevate. Its portfolio companies have gone on to raise around $800 million in follow-on funding, and have a combined value of nearly $2 billion. Dreamit is now investing in urban tech and healthcare – both areas where Tampa could play a role. In urban tech specifically, the city is currently home to a connected vehicle technology project that allows cars to communicate with roadways and other vehicles to receive warnings about roadway conditions, speed limit changes, dangers and more. An autonomous shuttle project was also in the works in Tampa, but has been put on hold. Another project in development is SunTrax, a testing ground for new toll technology and self-driving cars. Test tracks like the 2.25-mile long SunTrax facility, may be increasingly needed to trial autonomous cars in the future, given the death of the pedestrian caused by an Uber autonomous car. It’s likely we’ll see more driverless cars pulled from roads and projects put on hold, then only allowed to test on closed tracks until the technology is safer. “Jeff is a visionary business leader who drives results. He built a track record of legendary returns in his investment career and produced a new model of how urban areas can work in the 21st century,” said Steve Barsh, Managing Partner at Dreamit, in a statement about the new investment. “We back startups operating in large and important verticals that are ripe for innovation with more verticals to come. Vinik’s investment and participation is an exciting evolution for Dreamit and the startup community, and we look forward to working with Jeff as we continue to build and expand Dreamit.”","Real estate investor and Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik has expanded his relationship with Dreamit Ventures through a new $12 million investment into the early stage fund and accelerator, announced earlier this week.

Stan Schroeder,"USB Restricted Mode, a new iOS feature that protects unauthorized access of the data on your iOS device, has a glaring omission that would make it quite easy for someone to beat in many scenarios. The feature, introduced in iOS 11.4.1 and iOS 12 beta 2, is supposed to make the data on your iPhone safe even if someone can physically access it. One hour after the phone's last been unlocked, it enters USB Restricted Mode, which disables data access to its Lightning port. However, security firm ElcomSoft has discovered a way to disable the timer, and it's ridiculously easy — you just need to plug an accessory into the iPhone's Lightning port, and the timer is disabled. SEE ALSO: The 2018 iPhones could come in gold, blue, red, and even orange USB Restricted Mode is designed to protect against devices such as GrayKey, a hardware device that enables an attacker to extract data from an iOS device they don't have legitimate access to. While it doesn't offer full protection from GrayKey, it significantly hampers any would-be attacker by limiting the time to perform an attack to one hour or less. However, ElcomSoft says that merely plugging in nearly any device (not just ones that have previously been connected to that phone), such as Apple's Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter, will disable the timer. This would give an attacker enough time to bring the device to a lab and then work on it for as much time as they'd like. This trick works in iOS 11.4.1 and iOS 12 beta 2, both of which have the USB Restricted Mode feature, ElcomSoft claims. According to ElcomSoft, the problem likely lies in Apple's Lightning communication protocol — in other words, the way the iPhone ""talks"" to devices that are plugged into it. When you connect the iPhone to a computer, the two devices exchange cryptographic keys and establish trust. Many Lightning accessories, however, don't have the capability to do that, so the iPhone just trusts them by default. If this is indeed a bug and not intended behavior, it might be hard for Apple to fix it. According to ElcomSoft, a fix could render numerous Lightning accessories useless — though it might be possible to make sure the iOS device only communicates with devices that were previously plugged into it.

Andrew Liptak,"A new report from Japanese supply chain site Macotakara (via 9to5Mac ) suggests that Apple could be refreshing its line of iPad Pro models by shrinking them down a bit, and eliminating the 3.5mm headphone jack, much like recent iPhone models. The site notes that it’s possible that next year’s lineup could see their dimensions shrink a bit — the 10.5 inch models could be 247.5 mm high, 178.7 mm wide, and 6 mm thick (it’s currently 250.6 mm high, 174.1 mm tall and 6.1 mm thick), while the 12.9 inch models might come in at 280 mm tall, 215 mm wide and 6.4 mm thick (which is currently at 305.7 mm tall, 220.6mm wide, and 6.9 mm thick.) There have been rumors of a full-screen iPad Pro already The report also suggests that the iPad will come with FaceID — something we’ve already seen rumors about since late 2017, and which was seemly confirmed in a recent iOS 12 beta. Macotakara notes that the feature won’t work in landscape mode, and that accordingly, Apple might move the Lightning connector from the bottom to the when the iPad is vertical, and accordingly, the smart connector for the keyboard might be shifted to the bottom, near the Lightning connector, meaning that the tablet might be designed to be used vertically. The report also hints that there could be some changes coming to the iPhone lineup as well, noting that a rumored 6.1 LCD model will feature a “full active” display with four narrow bezels, and utilizing a “Japan Pixel Eyes” sensor. It’s speculated that the upcoming phone will be a bit cheaper than last year’s iPhone X. Apple is expected to hold its annual launch event in September, where it unveils the updates to its phones and tablets, and we’ll undoubtably see more rumors and leaks in the run-up to that.","A new report suggests that Apple could shrink the iPad Pro and eliminate the headphone jack, while a new iPhone model could have a full active display.",2018-07-28T16:35:50Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",A new report claims that the next iPad Pros might shrink and lose their headphone jacks,https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/28/17625204/apple-rumor-ipad-pro-iphone-shrink-no-headphone-jack-report,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7thqOSIN5XMgxOeLVR63V5rxQ5A=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6261027/verge-8.0.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,lightning,1
Andrew Freedman,"The second powerful nor'easter in less than a week lived up to expectations, and then some, from the Philadelphia area northward into New York and Boston. A slow-moving, narrow band of heavy snow parked itself over northern New Jersey for much of the day on Wednesday, dumping snow at 2 to 4 inches per hour. While New York City only managed to pick up 2.9 inches of snow in Central Park, areas just 20 miles outside of the city had up to 2 feet of heavy, wet snow accumulate. All night long, residents of the suburbs of these three cities reported snapping sounds from tree branches, as well as power transformer explosions, as the wet of the snow proved too much for many trees and power lines. SEE ALSO: Hang onto your butts as another nor'easter cripples travel, triggers thundersnow As was predicted, the storm was an unusually prolific thundersnow producer, particularly in the New York City area, where lightning flashes and booming rumbles of thunder were noted during the entire day on Wednesday.

Wired Staff,"Alas, we knew this day would come. Amazon's fourth annual Prime Day Sale is about to crash from the virtual sky like a meteor in Fortnite, and as of April, there are 100 million Amazon Prime members set to scoop up all the deals that land. Prime Day started innocently enough back in 2015. It was a day-long sale celebrating Amazon's 20th anniversary, and a fun gift to the millions of Prime subscribers. The sale was so successful that Amazon made it an annual event, and it's been getting bigger and nuttier ever since. This year, Prime Day will stretch 36 straight hours, and likely feature more deals then ever, and in new categories. Amazon now owns Whole Foods and is trying to launch Twitch Prime, so we can expect more food and gaming deals for starters. Below are some tips if you have something you're hoping to buy on discount. When Prime Day Starts Starts: Prime Day kicks off on Monday, July 16 at 3 p.m. ET. Ends: 36 hours later on Wednesday, July 18 at 3 a.m. ET. That's not all, though. You can expect bursts of pre-Prime Day deals from July 3 all the way to kickoff. Amazon already has a bunch of deals on its own devices, which we've highlighted below, and more are on the way. How to Snag the Best Deals Prime Day is basically another Black Friday for Amazon. There are deals on almost everything, but not all of them are great. But to join the deal party, you must be an Amazon Prime member. You can sign up for Amazon Prime here. There is a 1-month free trial, and students can get 6 months free (and a discount), but odds are you're already onboard. If not, you should know that Prime is about $10 a month (if you subscribe annually) and offers free 2-day shipping on many items and access to the Prime Video service. There are other perks, like free Kindle books, and you can read them all here. Get Your Cards in Order: Timing is everything. Sign up for Amazon Prime, and if you don't shop on Amazon all that often, make sure your credit card and shipping address defaults are set, and that you have 1-click ordering enabled. Once you add a deal item to your cart, you'll have about 15 minutes to buy before it's released to another eager shopper. Set Up Deal Alerts for Particular Products: If you're hoping a particular item will go on sale, there are ways to keep an eye on it. First, install the Amazon Shopping app for iPhone or Android so you can get instant notifications. Then add the items to your Amazon Cart (You can ""Save for Later""). Amazon should notify you if the price changes. Another way to track changes is by using CamelCamelCamel.com. It lets you search up the price history of any product on Amazon and track them at a click. Better yet, if you sign up (free), it can import and track prices on your entire Amazon Wish List. (You can easily make wish lists on Amazon by clicking on the ""Add to List"" button on every product page.) Track Upcoming Lightning Deals: Lightning Deals can be super stressful. It's so easy to miss them, but if you have the time to browse through deals in the morning, you can track upcoming Lightning Deals using the Amazon Shopping app. Click on the hamburger icon in the upper left, then Today's Deals &gt; Upcoming. You can click the ""Watch this Deal"" button on any deal that's more than 10 minutes away to add it to your ""Watching"" list. The app should then notify you the moment Lightning strikes. Set up an Echo for Alexa Exclusive Deals: Last year Amazon offered Alexa-only pre-Prime day deals. If you own an Alexa device ( these are the best Echo &amp; Alexa Speakers, you can set up voice purchasing. In the Alexa app on your phone, head to Settings &gt; Accounts and select ""Purchase by Voice."" Learn more about it here. [Image of Amazon Echo HERE] Early Prime Day Deals We'll update this section as deals change, but here are a few of the early Prime Day deals Amazon has going. We'll update this list as we learn more. Other Stores Will Have Sales, Too Historically, retailers like Walmart and Best Buy have gotten pretty worked up about Amazon Prime Day and offered their own defensive sales to try and steal some of Amazon's thunder. Below are a few stores likely to start having sales right around Prime Day and before. When you buy something using the retail links in our stories, we may earn a small affiliate commission.

(Deleted account),"The next generation of iPhones may come equipped with all sorts of new cutting-edge features, but it will still be lagging behind the rest of the mobile world in one major aspect, according to a new report.
Apple will once again pass on USB-C port and instead equip the 2019 iPhone model with a Lightning port, according to Japanese tech site Macotakara
. The report, which was first spotted by 9to5Mac
, also states that the next iPhone will continue to be bundled with a USB-A charger. 
SEE ALSO: Apple's Smart Battery Case is the best way to power your iPhone for days
The reason this comes as a surprise to many is because the iPhone remains one of the last holdouts in the smartphone world, as most modern phones (especially Android devices) have embraced the new USB-C port for charging and data transfer. 
This latest news on Apple passing on USB-C for the iPhone is in contrast with an earlier report
 from last summer when supply-side sources were claiming the USB-C ports were on the way for Apples 2019 iPhone offering.
Macotakara claims that the reason behind Apples insistence on keeping the Lightning cable is simple: money. The report claims Apple stands to profit more from keeping the Lightning-related accessories for at least a few generations of the smartphone.
Nonetheless, the choice to keep the Lightning port on the iPhone is especially baffling when you consider how nearly every current generation Apple device, from the latest iPad Pro
 to the Macbook and Macbook Pro, swapped out its old ports to replace with USB-C. Apple even contributed to the creation of the USB-C port, so its odd that it continues to avoid embracing it on its flagship device.
SEE ALSO: Apple's Smart Battery Case is the best way to power your iPhone for days
Even more maddening is Apples reported decision to include a USB-A charger over a USB-C one. Apple could choose to keep the Lightning port, yet still give its customers an out-of-the-box solution to compatibility issues that arise with other USB-C devices.
Instead, users will continue to be forced to shell out the extra cash for a cable peripheral that will allow them to plug their iPhone into their MacBook. Even the bundled iPhone Lightning EarPods will remain incompatible with Apples laptops without a dongle.
Ultimately, it seems that dongle hell
 is here to stay.","The next generation of iPhones may come equipped with all sorts of new cutting-edge features, but it will still be lagging behind the rest of the mobile world in one major aspect, according to a new report.

Taylor Hatmaker,"We knew Jack Dorsey was bullish on bitcoin, but some new quotes reveal that he’s really really bullish. In an interview with the Times of London, the Twitter and Square chief executive expressed a strong belief in bitcoin’s shot at outliving its growing pains in order to grow into a ubiquitous digital currency. “The world ultimately will have a single currency, the internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be bitcoin,” Dorsey said. He added that the timeline would play out “probably over ten years, but it could go faster.” In spite of conceding that bitcoin “does not have the capabilities right now to become an effective currency,” Dorsey thinks that it will grow into a better one over time as improvements to the core technology roll out. “It’s slow and it’s costly, but as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable,” Dorsey told the Times. Just last week, Dorsey contributed to a $2.5 million seed round for Lightning Labs, a Bay Area startup focused on the Lightning Network, a protocol that layers on top of a cryptocurrency like bitcoin. That layer aims to speed things up by creating a secondary channel with its own mini digital ledger that keeps excess traffic off of a congested blockchain (you can read more about how that works in this helpful Coindesk explainer ). Dorsey also intends to continue supporting bitcoin through Square, his mobile payments company. Square Cash added support for bitcoin last year and the feature recently rolled out to all Square Cash users.","We knew Jack Dorsey was bullish on bitcoin, but some new quotes reveal that he’s really really bullish.

KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"Credit Claire O'Neill/The New York Times In the middle of a nor’easter that disrupted travel in the Northeast and inundated areas already drenched from last week’s storm, some New Yorkers and others on the East Coast made a resounding discovery: “thundersnow.” The curious phenomenon, when thunder and lighting are heard and seen during a snowstorm, has been documented since at least the year 1099. But its rarity — a 2009 analysis found that only 0.07 percent of snowfalls are accompanied by thunder — means that it never ceases to excite. The captivating nature of thundersnow was documented in an article in The New York Times on Sept. 24, 1884 : “I don’t believe there has been a thunderstorm that I have witnessed for the past 30 years,” said a gentleman of this city, “which has not given me occasion to ask scores of people if they had ever seen a thunder and lightning snowstorm, and I never met but one yet, besides myself who ever had.” (That gentleman’s stories about thundersnow must have never gotten old.) There are three ways thundersnow can develop in the United States, according to John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist and a professor of atmospheric science at Texas A&amp;M University. The first, which is most common to the central United States, mirrors the way regular thunderstorms are formed: Warmer, moist air close to the ground rises and mixes with colder, denser air higher up in the atmosphere. As the hot air moves up and the cold air moves down, the atmospheric instability can trigger lightning and the thunder that comes with it. In the case of a thundersnow event, air closer to the ground is just warm enough to rise and create atmospheric mixing, but it’s still cold enough that falling snow can stay frozen. This often happens in the Rockies, when the mountains trap pockets of warm air. “The air is cold enough down low that as the frozen precipitation falls out of it, it never encounters a warm enough layer of air to melt,” said Dr. Nielsen-Gammon. So instead of rain and lightning, there’s snow and lightning. The second scenario tends to happen around the Great Lakes in early winter. A thunderstorm develops even though temperatures are very cold, thanks to the relatively warm moist air that comes from the lakes. It’s intertwined with the same conditions that bring the region its lake effect snow. In the third scenario the low pressure of a powerful winter storm creates strong upward motions in the air, generating the atmospheric instability that in a typical thunderstorm would be driven by temperature changes. This is likely what led to New York City’s thundersnow. Even when the conditions are right, you won’t always notice the thunder. Snow is more likely to absorb the light of lightning and the sound of thunder than rain. But thundersnow tends to be accompanied by heavier snowfall, which you may indeed notice when your commute is snarled.","There are three ways thundersnow can develop in the United States, but it always brings the element of surprise.",2018-03-08T00:25:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How Thundersnow Happens: With Considerable Difficulty,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/climate/thundersnow.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/07/climate/cli-thundersnow/cli-thundersnow-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lightning,1

On Saturday, the league said in a tweet that it had put Marchand on notice that his actions were “unacceptable and similar behavior in the future will be dealt with by way of supplemental discipline.” The news was likely welcomed by Callahan, who had expressed displeasure about the episode after the game. “I don’t know what the difference is between spitting in someone’s face and licking it,” Callahan said. Having seen that the league had weighed in, Marchand’s coach, Bruce Cassidy, said on Sunday that he had instructed his player to “zip it,” ESPN reported. Cassidy also said he understood that Marchand’s moves were an attempt to get under his opponent’s skin. Nonetheless, he said he had urged him to find another way. Marchand led the Bruins in points during the regular season, and his coach suggested he might more effectively annoy opponents by “scoring some goals.” Athletes, though, have long invented creative ways to rattle their opponents.

Every refurbished Sonos includes the standard one-year Sonos warranty and access to their support, so theres really no downside in going this route, if you can find refurbs in stock. Every other time Sonos has offered this deal, its sold out quickly.
If you want to give the gift of a Tile Bluetooth gadget finder this Christmas, you should be sure to buy the one with a user-replaceable battery. Todays $20 deal on the brand new Tile Mate isnt as good as the $16 deal we saw earlier in the week, but its otherwise the best discount weve seen from the usual $25.
Through the years, Tile device trackers have gotten smaller, gained waterproofing, and extended

Wi-Fi range extenders cant work miracles, but if theres one spot in your house with spotty coverage, they can be a much cheaper solution than buying a new router. So at an all-time low $21, why not give this one a try? Just clip the $5 coupon to get the deal at checkout.
I have nothing but fond memories of the 90s, and I love everything about the styles from that era. (#sorrynotsorry) If you feel the same, the Impossible Project Polaroid 600 96 Cam Instant Camera, on sale for $152 at Nordstrom, deserves your attention. 
Its totally fresh color scheme will remind you of the days when things were crunk or fly or jiggy rather than lit or turnt or on fleek, and as long as instant cameras refuse to die, you may as well have the raddest one on the block.
If you got yourself a new TV on Black Friday (or even more recently), its cheaper than you might think to mount it to your wall. This highly rated Perlesmith mount can support TVs up to 55"", and its only $28 today with promo code EYB52OV7, complete with bonus accessories like a level, cord ties, and an HDMI cable.
If you ever want to watch TV, and loud movies in particular, without disturbing your neighbors, your kids, or your sleeping partner two feet away from you, you want a pair of RF headphones. Yes, not Bluetooth...RF.

Sennheiser makes some of the most popular and best-reviewed models out there, and their entry level RS 165s are on sale for $149 today on Amazon, the best price of the year. These dont support virtual surround sound like the 175s, but theyll still sound terrific, and once you get them set up, theyll be perfectly synced up with the video on your TV, with none of the lag you can get with Bluetooth.
Needless to say, if your partners video games and explosion-y action movies keep you awake at night, this would be an amazing (if slightly passive aggressive) gift.
Ankers most impressive entry in the true wireless headphone market is on sale for the lowest price weve ever seen, by a longshot.
You can read our impressions of the Zolo Liberty+ over on The Inventory, but here are some highlights:
3.5 hour battery, plus a charging case with enough power for 48 hours of playback.
Transparency mode that lets in some ambient noise.
Customizable EQ settings.
Bluetooth 5.0 for a stable connection.
Normally priced at $150, promo code ZWSDZ2010 will bring them down to $75 right now, just in time for the holidays. Thats less than they were selling for on Kickstarter, way back when.
For $15 less (with promo code ZWSDZ2000), you can also get the standard Zolo Liberties, which only carry 24 hours of charge in their case, rather than 48. They also lack transparency mode and customizable EQ settings, so its probably worth spending just a little more for the top-end model.
$12 is about what youd expect to pay for a 4-port USB charging hub, but this Aukey model also comes with two AC outlets, so your lamps and laptops dont have to go hungry.
The Anker PowerCore Fusion is one of our biggest sellers ever, because it combines a USB wall charger and a portable battery pack into a single product. Now, RAVPower has their own alternative with a slightly larger 6700mAh battery inside, and you can grab it for just $22 with promo code KINJAQFF.

Breville Smart Oven Air | $320 | Amazon
Breville added air frying and dehydrating features to your favorite line of toaster ovens, and the feature-packed Smart Oven Air is $80 off today, within $11 of the best price weve ever seen.
Trust me when I say that once you own one of these, youll hardly ever use your real oven anymore. It preheats significantly faster, its much easier to program, and its big enough to cook all but the biggest meals. They dont go on sale often though, and the Air model hasnt been this cheap since April. Trust me, itll really come in handy when it comes time to prepare Thanksgiving dinner.

Pat on the back for successfully completing another season of holiday shopping. Now its time to turn back to your own neglected needs. Home items ranging from lighting to textiles to furniture to decor accents are on sale at Amazon, and I know theres something there you were meaning to buy before you got sucked into the Christmas hustle.
Being able to see while you drive is pretty important, no matter what season it is. This Snow Joe Jumbo Telescoping Snow Broom and Ice Scraper 2-Pack will help you stay alive no matter how much snow has accumulated on your windshield. Toss it in your trunk and forget about it until you need it.
Especially during the bleak winter months, it feels good to have something green in your home. This set of five succulents is on sale for $13, and they dont need much sunlight or water, giving them a solid chance of surviving the frigid months ahead. Plus, they make for nice plant children to nurture while all other flora is cold and dead outside.

Internet-connected security cameras dont have to set you back over $100; this model from Yi is packed with features, and only $32 today.
The Yi Dome can detect and track motion (even in the dark), or even the sound of babies crying, and send a push notification to your phone to check in. Built in microphones and speakers mean that you can even use the camera as a two-way intercom. Side note: What would you say to a robber in this scenario? I have no idea.
You can save your clips to a microSD card for free, or use Yis Cloud service as a remote DVR for added security. There are paid tiers available, but itll save six second clips of the last weeks worth of motion alerts for free, no monthly contract required.

We spot checked a lot of products, and while they arent all down to all-time low prices, everything we saw represented at least a decent discount. A few of our picks are below, but there are pages upon pages of deals, so youll want to head over to Amazon to see them all.
You know that song We Need a Little Christmas, about decorating for the holidays way too early? And how it specifically says its just a week after Thanksgiving? To our 2018 minds thats ridiculous, but I suppose there was a time when you didnt put up your tree and lights until well into December.
If you still live on that schedule, its relevant to your life that Home Depot has a bunch of holiday decorations on sale today. Wreaths, inflatables, projectors, and more are marked down, so you can finally put up the brightest string of lights youve ever seen and hang some tinsel on that evergreen bough.
String up these trendy Edison bulb string lights in your backyard and make Pinterest proud. This 49-foot strand is completely weatherproof, so you can leave them up year-round. Although not the best price weve seen on these, they normally sell for $50, but today you can light your space with them for $36 with promo code 3FK8HUTY.
Is there a better gift than a big-ass box of meat? Im struggling to think of one. Butcher Box sells $135 e-gift cards that can be redeemed for the special holiday gift box of your giftees choice, and our readers can buy a card for just $120 right now with promo code KINJA.
You can check out the gift box options here, to get an idea of what your lucky giftee will be feasting on in January. Youre going to want to invite yourself over for dinner.
Whats better than earning stars with your Starbucks order? Earning Amazon credit, obviously (though youll still earn stars too, fear not). While supplies last, you can use promo code SBUX (or Elsbucks, as the baristas would write on that codes cup) to get $5 in Amazon credit when you spend $25 on a digital Starbucks gift card.
You were going to spend that $25 at Starbucks anyway, or at the very least, you can give the gift card as a gift, and keep the credit for yourself (we wont tell). This deal wont even last as long as holiday cup season though, so gulp it down while you can.
The Claw claims to be the worlds smallest multitool, and theres really no reason to doubt it. Roughly the same length as a penny, the little piece of titanium can open bottles and paint cans, turn screws, wedge open key rings, remove staples, and most critically of all, open up boxes that you ordered from Kinja Deals. Get it for $15 today (down from $22) with our exclusive promo code KINJADEALS.
As a person who has sent in many, many rounds of cupcakes and other classroom treats for birthdays and holidays, I know Ive spent a small fortune on cupcake liners. I cant argue the fact that theyre wasteful and frivolous, but they also look festive and save me cleanup time.
What I should do and you too, if you bake at all is invest in some of these AmazonBasics Reusable Silicone Baking Cups, currently at an all-time price low. (The 24-pack is technically a better deal, but if you absolutely want no more than 12, that set has never been cheaper either.)
The downside: Theyre add-on items. The upside: You could order enough to hit the $25 minimum and literally never have to think about buying baking cups again. 
How much would you pay for superpowers? Does $20 seem fair? Because thats what itll cost you (via code KINJACRANE) to procure the Power Crane Single Person Furniture Moving Kit, which grants you the ability to raise and move up to 330 lbs. without help. It includes a jack, risers, dollies, and the satisfaction of saying I told you so to anybody who claims its impossible for one human to rearrange furniture alone.
If the image youve been hoping to craft for yourself is I totally have my life together, and also Im really good at parties, a proper bar cart is one of your household must-haves. This Better Homes &amp; Gardens Fitzgerald 2-Tier Serving Cart has all the style you seek, and today its just $64.
Even if youre not able to have it flawlessly stocked in time for your next shindig, just the fact that youre started the process will be worth something. All decent acts of curation take time, and you can always fill the empty space with pretty knick knacks or drink accessories in the interim.

There are many, many things wrong with the behavior depicted in Mad Men, and I dont have the energy to begin to get into all of it. Even the way the execs offices are set up with bar carts could look at lot more like functional alcoholism than professional hospitality from many angles, but lets take the charitable view here. Always being able to offer visitors a drink is courteous, and a nice decanter set looks good in almost any environment.
This Godinger Globe Whiskey Decanter Set drops to just $42 via code 6GEHT6Y3, so today might be the day that you lean a little towards the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce way of doing things. (But just a little, and only the good parts.) It has fancy etching and a ship inside the bottle, so itll look like you paid a lot more than you did. Im not saying lie about the cost, but letting people believe what they wanted got Don Draper pretty far in life.
Once youve gotten used to keeping a multi-tool on you, it can be hard to go without. But the TSA doesnt care about that, and good luck getting your Leatherman on a plane.
The Gerber Shard isnt as fancy as a lot of mini tool gizmos, but its airline approved and it fits on your keychain and its $5. It features three drivers, a wire stripper, a pry bar, and a bottle opener, so maybe its just enough to keep you from having handy gadget withdrawals in no weapons situations. (Its also a nice little gift for people that dont really need or want anything else.)
Firstleaf is an online wine club that learns your preferences, offers tons of options, and most importantly, saves you money compared to buying from the store. Its a solid deal any time, but its even better for our readers from now through the holidays.
Every new Firstleaf member gets an introductory delivery with three bottles of wine for just $15, plus $5 shipping. Every box thereafter includes six bottles for $80, plus $10 shipping. If you use this link and promo code Kinja when you sign up though, youll get free shipping on every box for your entire first year. Thatll save you over $100 if you get a new box every month.

While Gunnar glasses are marketed towards gamers, they can be effective at reducing eyestrain for anyone that spends their day staring at a screen.

Amazon knows youre already going to shop there for most nonessential purchases; the next step in their plan for world domination is to condition you to come there for boring necessities as well. To that end, a bunch of health, beauty, and grocery items are on sale today. Do what you have to do.
Theres never a bad time to save on Nike. Right now, Amazon is marking down a range of Nike activewear, along with accessories including bags, hats, and socks, so you can suit up for any athletic (or just lounging) you have in your future.
The holidays can be stressful, and you totally deserve to pamper yourself after we cross the finish line. If that sounds nice, but your bank account is still recovering from Christmas shopping, The Body Shop can help. They have a bunch of sale items starting at just $1, and everything ships for free. 
There are tons of beauty items, creams, butters, scrubs, and more for under $5, so you can stock up without stressing about the cost. That would be counterproductive! The goal here is to unwind.
A guy could build his entire wardrobe at Perry Ellis. They offer everything from tees to suits, and if its in their sale section today, its an extra 50% off at checkout. Were talking $10 belts, $12 shirts, $25 pants. Theres no free shipping this time around, but it seems like its a $7 flat rate no matter how much you order, so load up!
Note: Discount shown at checkout.
Sneak some sneakers under the tree, thanks to Zappos current deal on Nike. Select Nike styles for men, women, and kids are 25% off, so the whole family can jingle bell rock some new shoes. And as long as you get your orders in by 1pm EST today, theyre guaranteed to be delivered by Christmas Eve for free, so sprint to checkout before this deal hops on its sleigh and rides away.
Watch out! You dont want to miss this this Timex watch sale before the holidays hit. Nows the time to take advantage of 30% off a selection of Timex watches for men and women, any of which would make for a nice gift. Plus, if you spend $75 or more, shipping is free. But you dont have a minute to spare; shop now before time runs out on these deals.

Well, this is an easy sale to get behind. Eddie Bauer is taking 50% off just about everything, and theyre doing it right as were hitting peak cold weather season. Thats impeccable timing considering theyre best known as the company that patented the first quilt down jacket. Shop mens, womens and even gear to stock up on everything you need for the winter, from base layers and flannels, to parkas and shells its all* 50% off.
Note: Excludes sleeping bags, tents, and non Eddie Bauer-brand products.
May your days, and also your face, be merry and bright this holiday season with the help of Pat McGrath Labs. The cult-favorite cosmetics brand is taking 25% sitewide with code VIP25, so stock up on highly pigmented, mesmerizingly shimmery products for lips, eyes, and skin and shine brighter than a Christmas tree light at your next holiday party.
Clarks are a nice blend of comfort and style, but attempting to stock your entire closet with them could get a little expensive. Today, though, you can get two select pairs of mens or womens shoes for $99, which is one of the best deals youll see on Clarks. It includes boots, sandals, sneakers, and dress shoes, so you can shop for every occasion while enjoying major savings.
I have a weird relationship with massages. I really, really like them, but I also spend the entire massage feeling lowkey guilty about the experience. Like, I dont have that kind of free time to burn just lying around, and also it seems weird to me to coerce people into pampering me, even when its literally their chosen profession. I still have an unused massage gift certificate from Mothers Day 2017. IDK, man. I have some issues to work on.
But until I finish doing that, Ive found that letting robots do the work in my own home is mostly okay, and Mynt is discounting a handful of massaging contraptions for people like me. For your standard tense neck and shoulders, theres the Mynt Shiatsu Massager with Heat for $42 or the Mynt Shiatsu Massage Pillow with Heat for $33 via code USM23515.
If your pain points are all located in your feet, theres also the Mynt Percussion Foot Massager for $140 via code USM27106 and the on-page coupon on page, or the Mynt Shiatsu Foot Massager for $150 via USM26116 and an on-page coupon.
No machine can truly replicate the spa experience, of course, but like I said, thats not totally a bad thing. Now, if youll excuse me, Im going to go tend to my achey shoulders, because thats what I do. Yeah. I need these.
TENS (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) massagers seem a bit like pseudoscience, but every time we post a deal on one of these things, we hear nothing but rave reviews. In fact, I use one occasionally after exercising, and it does seem to reduce muscle pain. At the very least, it feels cool.
Naipo has long made popular physical massage products, so an electrical alternative seems like a natural progression.
Weve got a sale that will make you get out your wallet...and ditch it for something newer and cuter. The pocketbook purveyors at Kate Spade want to hook you up with new handbags, wallets, clothing, jewelry and other accessories this holiday season, so theyre taking an extra 40% off already marked down sale items. Use promo code MOREEXTRA to take advantage of this designer deal. And, just saying, handbags and accessories make great gifts, and if you order by tonight, you can get your items by Christmas Eve, plus free shipping.
REI is making the holidays even happier with a festive sale that is positively jolly. Starting today and continuing through December 24, the outdoor retailer is taking up to 40% off select clearance items (thats the same as their Cyber Monday sale, by the way).
Outdoor adventurers can seek deals on womens and mens apparel, along with a range of gear for camping, hiking, and all things snow. And you can bet a few of your favorite brands, like Columbia, The North Face, and Patagonia, will be marked down, too. Take advantage of this sale now, and let the knowledge that you saved a bundle give you a warm feeling inside when you head outside in your new gear this winter.

Hindsight is 20/20. For instance, resurrecting hordes of dinosaurs to populate a theme park is probably not a great idea. Now, dont you make a big mistake by passing up this roaring deal on the five-film Jurassic World Movie Collection. Relive the movie magic of Jeff Golblums glistening abs and the most terrifying scene involving Jell-O in Hollywood history, not to mention the newer film iterations featuring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard running for her life in high heels. Oh, and also a lot of human-devouring dinosaurs. Be sure to take a bite out of the action before this sale goes extinct.

This box set gets you every James Bond movie for $2.83 each. Some, in fairness, are not worth that much &lt;cough&gt; Die Another Day &lt;cough&gt;, But classics like Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, and Casino Royale are well worth watching and rewatching. Just note that this set doesnt include digital copies, only Blu-rays, so youll need to shake up a vodka martini and enjoy them at home.
Patent prints are all the rage, but you can put an extra geeky spin on your decor with these sci-fi themed ones. Blueprints of BB-8 and the Starship Enterprise, profiles of the Harry Potter wands, a flat lay of Links weapons from The Legend of Zelda. Youll find all of those and more in this MassDrop sale, and theyre all just $13 for an 18""x24"" print.
Try not to freak out, but this post is about a $118 board game. That sounds like a lot of money. It is a lot of money. But Gloomhaven is Board Game Geeks #1 board game ever, and is astoundingly good according to Ars Technica. Hell, it weighs 20 pounds! If you love board games, this should be on your bucket list.
The thing is though, even when retailers have it in stock, it usually costs $140+, and eBay resellers will charge you even more, so this is a major discount were talking about here.
The game includes permanent stickers that transform the board as you play, but you can grab this removable, vinyl sticker pack instead, if you want to replay.
Dancing games used to be pretty simple: Putting your feet in the right spots at the right time = victory. (I still love you, DDR. Sandstorm forever.) Over the years, though, the games have evolved and gotten dangerously close to actual whole-body dancing, which requires a measure of talent and coordination. 
Do you or someone you know possess those traits, or wish to develop them? Then you should know that Best Buy via eBay has cut $15 off Just Dance 2019 for Wii, Switch, Xbox One, and PS4, beating the Black Friday price. Will you look cool playing it? Almost certainly not. But will you have tons of fun and maybe even get a little fitter? Thats an absolute yes.
The PlayStation Classic is missing a lot of critical games, but it seems like its going to be relatively straightforward to add some yourself.

Last week I gave up on hoping that Pokemon Power Action Pikachu would hit the $20 mark before Christmas, but now Amazon has made a fool of me and offered that exact deal. If youre the type of person that enjoys the thrill of waiting until the super ultra last minute, this is just the kind of deal that makes it worthwhile. But wow, you cut it close on shipping.
Melissa &amp; Doug toys make me wish I could still be a kid. Theyre so perfect for pretend play that you cant help but be overcome by imagination. Amazon has a lot of them on sale today, too, which makes them even more appealing. Between the puzzles, play food and appliances, dress-up goods, and dolls and accessories, theres something to capture the interest of every kid (and adult).
Do you find the pressure of specific creation stifling? Are you overwhelmed by the array of LEGO sets designed to build predefined castles or spaceships or bridges? LEGO totally gets that. 
The LEGO Classic Bricks on a Roll 60th Anniversary Limited Edition Set, $25 at Walmart, features an assortment of wheels, bricks, and for some reason, eyes. Paired with the LEGO Classic Oceans Bottom Set ($19 at Amazon), it allows you to craft whatever weird and random objects your heart desires. A dog on a skateboard? Yep. An octopus chef? Sure! A double decker couch? Eh...
I get it, life is busy with preschoolers. Im not judging you if your Christmas shopping still isnt complete. But... you really need to get that done. Like, today. 
The Fisher-Price Think &amp; Learn Rocktopus, $38 at Walmart and Amazon, will still arrive in time to be part of the holiday haul, and its actually a pretty good gift it was a Toy of the Year finalist and features math, music, and game modes. Just note that youll probably want to buy from Walmart if packaging is important to you; Amazons comes in a small brown box.
Some kids are just born entrepreneurs. I have one who loves anything to do with money, business, and selling, so Im wondering if I should pick up this Osmo Pizza Co. Game to give us all a break from Monopoly and lemonade stand planning.
It comes with the Osmo iPhone Base, which allows kids to monitor real-time customer satisfaction levels and checks their work as far as order accuracy and giving correct change. (You can also buy it without the base if you already have one, but you do need it for the game to work as intended.) 
Maybe itll give your children just the experience they need to become actual titans of industry. At worst, itll just give them something fun to do that sneakily reinforces their math skills.
If you missed out on all the Black Friday Switch deals, theres still time to (sort of) save right now. Amazons tossing in a $25 Amazon.com gift card when you buy the console today, whichll get you nearly halfway to the mandatory copy of Smash. Or the mandatory copy of Breath of the Wild. Or Mario Odyssey. Or Mario Kart. There are so many great Switch games, you guys!

Magformers are crazy cool. Im drawn to them sheerly because of the bright colors, but theyre also neat for busy fidgeting (come on, theyre magnetic shapes), building imagined objects, and generally flexing those STEM muscles.

Lets do some quick math. Those weird animal ride-ons at the mall cost $20 per hour, so 15 rides would equal $300. If you believe your child could or would spend that much time on a giant motorized rolling creature, the smart financial decision might be to buy a Kid Trax 12-Volt Rideamals Scout Pony Interactive Ride-On for $298 and keep it at home for endless use.
Scout has functions the mall animals dont it reacts to being brushed and fed, and can even dance. With a library of sounds, movements, and music, it also feels friendlier than its counterparts in retail captivity. Somewhere in there is a message about the delicate balance between man and nature, wrapped in the scratchy blanket of capitalism.

Alex Cranz,"A post by DigiTimes that’s making the rounds cites unnamed “analog IC vendors” who say that Apple could be moving the iPhone and iPad to USB-C by 2019. That move would spell the gradual demise of Apple’s proprietary Lightning port, which was introduced in 2012 and has been the connector for basically every iProduct since. That would be really cool! Imagine using the same plug to charge your phone, tablet, and laptop. Imagine using the same HDMI to USB-C or SD card to USB-C adapters used with your laptop to get video out on your phone, or photos in. An all USB-C world is what we were promised with the announcement of the standard back in 2014, and the largest phone and tablet maker putting it in its phones and tablets would be the final boost the standard needs to become ubiquitous. But let’s be real...USB-C is probably not coming to the iPhone any time soon. Apple has led the USB-C charge in the laptop space. It was one of the first laptop makers to include it back in 2015 with the then new MacBook. And it made waves in late 2016 with the new MacBook Pro that killed nearly every other port in favor of USB-C. Looking at that one could infer that Apple is going to embrace the connector in phones and tablets next, following in the footsteps of nearly every top Android handset maker today. First, consider that by Apple standards Lightning is still a baby! FireWire was in Apple products for twelve years. The 30-pin adapter found in that iPod you have in a drawer somewhere was used for 11 years. Lightning is only about six years old. But more importantly Lightning is a crucial part of Apple’s MFi licensing program. MFi is short for Made For iPod/iPhone/iPad. In order to get the cool little logo that appears on licensed products, including trustworthy Lightning cables and other accessories, a licensee has to pony up some money to Apple. That money used to amount to 1.5 to 8-percent of a product’s MSRP. But in 2014, according to this Quora post, the price dropped to a flat $4 per connector. That flat fee is rumored though. In order to join the MFi program potential licensees must sign an NDA that forbids disclosing the price. If they don’t sign, or opt out of the licensing program all together, manufacturers can still produce Lightning products, but it will lack certification, and as we’ve seen in the past, a failure to be certified can result in some nasty bugs presenting on the iProducts themselves. So most reputable cable and peripheral makers join MFi. What this means is that for every $8 USB-A to Lightning cable Amazon sells, Apple is getting a cut. It’s still a lot of money—particularly as iProducts are Apple’s best selling products. There’s also the fact that USB-C continues to...be kind of a mess. There’s no certification program for USB-C products. Usually there isn’t even a way to see how much data or energy a cable can handle without testing it (and potentially harming whatever USB-C port those cables are plugged into). This is why a lot of phone and laptop makers have to almost overbuild the USB-C ports on their products. They’re protecting against that one cousin who buys all his cables at the gas station and then wonders why they don’t work after a week. So why would Apple get rid of it’s nice safe, money making port to embrace USB-C? Particularly as Lighting currently supports the same data rates as USB 3.0—something USB-C also supports. There’s no real reason, thus far, for the company to move out of its safe zone on its most popular product. DigiTimes could be right, of course. The MacBook and MacBook Pro could be harbringers of an all USB-C future. But it probably won’t happen by 2019.

David Murphy,"You drop your phone and the screen shatters. Ugh. While you’ve probably been smart about putting your critical data on the cloud— right? —there might be some things you still want to extract from your smartphone before you take it in for repair or swap it out for a new one. Or you not be in a position to afford a new phone right now. How do you continue to use your phone when the screen is cracked? Do you have a tech question keeping you up at night? Tired of troubleshooting your Windows or Mac? Looking for advice on apps, browser extensions, or utilities you can use to accomplish a particular task? Let us know! Tell us in the comments below or email david.murphy@lifehacker.com. The only time I ever cracked a smartphone screen is when I accidentally dropped my iPhone 4S into a pool. (Waterproofing—er, water resistance —didn’t come until the iPhone 7.) That said, there are a number of other experts who know their way around broken screens, and there is a little salvation for you whether you’re dealing with a shattered iPhone or Android device. You’ll have more luck if the screen is partly shattered and some part of it responds to your commands, and less luck if you can’t get your finger-tapping to work at all. If your iPhone’s screen is broken... First, you’re probably going to want to do anything you can to authenticate into your device and disable USB Restricted Mode. I’ll get to why in a bit. If you’re lucky, you can still get into your device using Touch ID, though you’ll still have to deal with a shattered screen that might not be able to pull up your Settings app, depending on where it’s located on your screen. As Decipher Tools’ Kelly Heffner Wilkerson writes in this excellent blog post, hold down your Home button until Siri pulls up. Once you do that, tell Siri to “Turn on VoiceOver.” You can then use any part of your screen that still registers your finger and gestures to navigate through iOS. Use this trick to type in a pin if Touch ID doesn’t work (or wasn’t set up). This method will allow you to get into your device and do whatever you need to do—like launch Google Photos one last time to back up those vacation images, or maybe run a manual iCloud backup real quick. You can also just plug your iPhone directly into your desktop or laptop and rip your photos and videos (or create an iTunes backup) once you’ve authenticated in. And with the VoiceOver trick, you’ll even be able to allow a new computer to see your iPhone, in case you’re in an emergency and need to borrow a friend’s laptop. If your screen doesn’t work at all, you’re in for a bit more fun. You’ll want to grab a Lightning-to-USB adapter and use that to connect a simple USB keyboard to your device. You should be able to then use the keyboard’s number keys to authenticate into your device with your Passcode. Turn on VoiceOver mode, as previously instructed, and you should be able to navigate through your phone and get to what you need. As for turning off USB Restricted Mode, remember that your iPhone will flip off the Lightning port if it’s been an hour since you last unlocked your device. That doesn’t give you a huge window to get a Lightning-to-USB adapter and a crappy old USB keyboard, but it’s something. If your Android smartphone’s screen is broken... If you have the right converter for your Android device, you can do the same keyboard trick : plug an old USB keyboard directly into a [your phone’s connection]-to-USB converter (likely an OTG cable), and you should be able to just type in a PIN code to unlock your device. You can even connect to your smartphone with a Bluetooth mouse, if you want to get fancy. You can also try enabling MTP mode for your smartphone so you can transfer files off it—and you’ll probably want to do a quick Web search to make sure you have the right steps for your specific Android device. If your device has USB Debugging mode already on, or you can turn it on, you can also try a tool like Scrcpy to control your device over a typical USB connection to your desktop or laptop. Samsung’s Smart Switch software or Kies might also be able to help you out, if either is applicable. Basically, if you can somehow get MTP enabled to transfer files off manually, or USB debugging mode to use a variety of apps (or ADB ) to rip files off of your device, you’ll be OK. In some cases, just authenticating into your device and launching a manual backup should be enough.",You drop your phone and the screen shatters. Ugh.

Patrick Allan,"When I take photos or shoot video, I like to use a nice camera, and then import the photos to my iPad—which is my dedicated photo editing and social media sharing device. But if I want to import video from that same SD card, it’s a more complicated process. Here’s how you do it. There’s more to a travel photographer’s kit than a camera body and a few lenses. Here are the… Read more Read Step 1: Buy an Apple Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader These little dongles are amazing for photogs on the go. All you have to do is plug it into your iPad’s Lightning port, and then stick the SD card in the slot. You’ll quickly see all the images on the card, and you can import as many of them as you like (even RAW images). Whenever I’m traveling, I shoot on a Sony a7R II, transfer the images to my iPad, and then use Adobe Lightroom to make them look even better. It’s a great setup. What you won’t be shown, however, is any video files on the card. For whatever reason, Apple doesn’t make it easy to transfer video files to iPads or iPhones unless it was shot on one of those devices (or already lives on your Mac). It’s a shame, especially since iPads have some decent video-editing capabilities. So, you’ll need to get creative. Step 2: Make Sure You’re In MP4 Format Before I begin, a quick note on formats. Whatever you’re using to shoot, make sure the video files come out as MP4s, or that you can convert them to MP4s. Otherwise your iOS device probably won’t be able to do anything with them. Step 3: Move the Video Files to the DCIM Folder One of the reasons the iPad won’t see your video files is because they’re probably in a separate folder that iOS won’t check. For example, with my Sony camera, video files are stored in PRIVATE &gt; M4ROOT &gt; CLIP, but they need to be in the DCIM (or “digital camera images”) folder instead. If your files aren’t in a DCIM folder, you’ll need to move them. I use a laptop with a built-in SD card reader to do this, but you can also use a USB-based SD card reader. Copy the files from their origin folder, and then paste them somewhere in the DCIM folder. If your SD card doesn’t have a DCIM folder, you’ll need to create one. So you took a trip somewhere cool, snapped a bunch of photos, and now you have no idea what to do… Read more Read Step 4: Rename the Files With 8-Character File Names Now that you have the video files in the right folder, you’ll probably have to rename them. The new file name—and yes this is bizarre—must be exactly eight characters long, plus the file extension (“.MP4""). For example, my Sony camera names video files something like “C0300.MP4,” but I have to rename them to something like “clip0001.MP4"". I do not fully understand why this is necessary (if you do, hit me up), but it is. Step 5: Import the Video Files Your video files are in the correct format, they’re in the right folder, and they’re renamed. You’re finally ready to import! Plug the Lightning dongle into your iPad and insert your SD card. You should see your video files among your photos on the import screen. You can now edit them with various apps or share them on Instagram—like I was finally able to do with this cute ducklings video: This entire process is a pain, but you get used to it pretty quickly. And while it’s unfortunate that you’ll need a laptop for it, at least you can plan ahead and load up a bunch of video to work on—during long plane rides, for example. There are other ways for importing video that don’t require renaming files, but they can be even more complicated, and require several more adapters. For now, this is as easy as it gets.","When I take photos or shoot video, I like to use a nice camera, and then import the photos to my iPad—which is my dedicated photo editing and social media sharing device.

Adriana Velez,"Nothing beats lying on the sofa and gazing about with pride at the new home you just moved into. That is, unless the reason you’re lying on the sofa is because you strained your back moving furniture. If you’re not used to picking up heavy things (and even if you are), it’s pretty easy to wreck yourself trying to get your bed or sofa in place. You bend, lift, twist, lurch, and crack! A bolt of lightning hits your spine and lays you low for the rest of the day. Or maybe the next six months. It doesn’t have to be this way. You can move your furniture and live to walk upright the next day with just a few simple techniques. So we tapped physical therapists and certified strength and conditioning specialists Michael Lau, Craig Lindell, and Arash Maghsoodi, A.K.A. The Prehab Guys, for their tips. (Prehab is the work you do to prevent an injury, by the way.) And we talked with another certified strength and conditioning specialist Anders Varner, who is also the co-creator of The Low Back Fix program. Here’s what they advise. Get closer “Bring the object as close as you can to your body,” The Prehab Guys told me. “Without getting into biomechanics, the closer an object’s center of mass is to you, the shorter the lever arm is. A short lever arm means less torque is required for you to lift the object.” Don’t bend over at the waist Instead, lower down by bending at the knees and hips, The Prehab Guys say, and keep your back as straight as possible while lowering down and lifting. Get directly in front of the object Don’t just face it, more or less. Actually square your shoulders and your feet to to the object. “Lifting an object that is directly in front of you rather than off to the side prevents unwanted spinal compensation and puts your body in the best position to utilize the glutes and quads to generate power,” The Prehab Guys told us. Your glutes, by the way, are the muscles in your butt. And your quadriceps are at the front of your thighs. The one time my mom watched a video of me deadlifting, she cringed with fear that I was going to… Read more Read Don’t look up “Want to save your back and knees when moving your couch?” says Varner. “Stop looking up.” Looking up puts your neck in cervical extension—i.e. It keeps your neck stretched out at an awkward angle. “Your spine is strongest when it is in a neutral position,” Varner adds. “This means your chin is tucked, eyes forward, ribs down, maintaining a slight squeeze in your glutes.” This position is what Varner considers the baseline for injury reduction. Lift with your legs “We humans are strong,” The Prehab Guys say, “so use all the glorious muscles you have in your legs and don’t rely solely on your back.” If you’re not used to lifting with your legs, remembering to keep your back straight while you lift may help. Breathe with your movement Beyond the classic advice of “lift from the legs,” the secret sauce to lifting safely, Varner says, is the way you breathe. “Taking a deep inhale through the nose into your belly creates tension in your deep core muscles,” he says. “These core muscles strengthen and protect the low spine. A strong core means you can move heavier objects farther, safer, and more efficiently.” When in doubt, stick your butt out Okay, one more, just because I love this phrase by biomechanist and author Kate Bowman. As she demonstrates in the above video, sticking out your butt makes it much easier for you to use your legs instead of your back when lifting.","Nothing beats lying on the sofa and gazing about with pride at the new home you just moved into.

CURTIS RUSH,"Cooper will never forget what Bowman told him.
Youll be back soon, said Bowman, who happens to have been the coach of the 1976-77 Canadiens and the 1995-96 Red Wings. Dont worry about it. I lost my first 12 Stanley Cup finals games.
The Lightning lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games the next year. Then last season Tampa Bay already loaded with superstar talent in forwards Steven Stamkos and Nikita Kucherov, goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy and defenseman Victor Hedman added what it thought were the final two pieces by acquiring defenseman Ryan McDonagh and forward J.T. Miller from the Rangers at the trade deadline. 
But the Lightning lost to the Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference finals in seven games. 
In their first full season in Tampa Bay, McDonagh has had a resurgent season, ranking No. 2 in the league with a plus-38 rating, and Miller tallied 47 points.
This is the effect youre getting, Cooper said. A year later, when everybody is more comfortable, and they know what grocery store to go to, now theyre here just to play hockey. There are no other distractions, and were reaping the benefits of last years trade deadline.
Other off-season adjustments have paid dividends.
Tampa Bay has No. 1-ranked power play and penalty killing units, but last season the Lightning were ranked 28th out of 31 teams in penalty killing efficiency.
Rick Bowness, who oversaw the defensive unit, was let go along with assistant coach Brad Lauer. Derek Lalonde was hired with Jeff Halpern to work with the forwards, and Todd Richards was hired to focus on the defense.
During a nine-game stretch in November, the Lightning gave up 13 power-play goals. Richards called a players meeting.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"Anyone using an iPhone might think it’s difficult to switch to an Android device. But Google’s latest smartphone, the Pixel 2, alleviates the anxiety of switching by taking care of all the annoying bits, like copying your photos or contacts. You’ll need to change some settings before you can transfer from one operating system to the next, but the entire process is a lot less stressful than importing and exporting data you might have trouble properly identifying or moving (everyone hates VCF files). What You’ll Need To seamlessly transfer your data from iOS to Android, you’ll need to get your equipment in order. That means the computer that manages your iTunes backups, your iPhone, a USB to Lightning cable, and your Pixel 2 equipment. Bundled with the Pixel 2 (and 2 XL) is a Quick Switch Adapter, a USB-C to USB-A adapter that lets you connect your Pixel 2, with its USB-C port, to an iOS device using a traditional USB-A to Lightning cable. You’ll need that. Inside the box is a SIM card ejector tool. You’ll need that, too. First, Disable iMessage Before you switch from one phone to another, you’ll need to turn off iMessage. This will ensure your texts won’t end up in message purgatory, where texts sent by Android users switching from iOS end up undelivered. Visit Settings, tap Messages, and toggle off iMessage. Simple! Decrypt Your iPhone The amount of data transferred to your Pixel 2 will be affected if you’ve enabled backup encryption for your iOS device. To alleviate the issue, you’ll need to disable backup encryption by connecting your iOS device to a computer running iTunes. Uncheck “Encrypt iPhone Backup” on Summary page, and give iTunes a few minutes to backup your iPhone without encryption. Switch Your SIM, Charge Your Phones You should switch out your iPhone’s SIM after disabling iMessage and decrypting your iPhone to avoid any complications. You can use the Pixel 2’s included SIM removal tool to pop open your iPhone’s SIM and insert it into your Pixel 2. You are now free to turn on both of your devices. Ensure both have been charged to at least 50%, or else you won’t be able to initiate the transfer process. Connect your Pixel 2 to your preferred Wi-Fi network. Then follow the Pixel 2’s on-screen prompts. Make a Google Account, Select Your Data If you’re switching to Android, you’re going to want to create a Google account to store all that transferred data. After you create one (or sign in with your current Google account) you can pick and choose which bits of data to transfer, like photos, messages, calendars, and contacts. Or just copy it all and say goodbye to your walled garden. Behold: your new, Android-based walled garden, complete with AirDrop and Bluetooth-powered headphone-pairing alternatives !","Anyone using an iPhone might think it’s difficult to switch to an Android device.

Alex Cranz,"The USB-C port on the new iPad Pro is a big deal. Besides charging the device and showing off Apples decision to take baby steps away from Lightning, it also allows the iPad to use the wide variety of USB-C dongles and doodads available. On paper it would seem like the USB-C port would allow the iPad Pro to finally make its way into real laptop land by adding useful capabilities like allowing you to plug into hard wired internet or use a monitor and keyboard. And technically it can do those things, just not all at the same time unless you have a USB-C hub. Its a little more difficult than you would think as the iPad Pro notably supports USB-C, but does not support Thunderbolt 3 with which shares it shares a port design. The majority of available hubs use Thunderbolt 3. So I could plug it into my monitor or my keyboard or ethernet, but I could not use the Thunderbolt 3 hub I currently have all three plugged into. My cheap USB-C hub with Ethernet and USB 3.0 ports worked perfectly when plugged in, but USB-C only hubs arent as common or as high quality as Thunderbolt 3 hubs. Using a keyboard with the iPad Pro is wonderfulthe Smart Keyboard case is just as expensive as a high-end USB-C keyboard, and not nearly as pleasant to type on. So when youre sitting at a desk, or even lugging a full-sized keyboard to a coffee shop, that doesnt feel quite as obnoxious as youd expect, especially when you plug it into the iPad Pro and it just works. The monitor is another matter. I plugged the iPad Pro into a 4K Dell monitor, and the image on the iPad immediately appeared on my monitor. Then I opened Netflix and the video itself popped up on the big display. Amazing! Then I went to switch to another application, foolishly assuming my Netflix video would continue to play on the larger monitor, rather than just mirroring the iPad. Instead, Netflix closed, and Chrome was now open. Duh! Its not an extra monitorits just a mirror. And that is annoying. While there are plenty of situations when its useful to mirror your smaller display on something larger, not including the option to use an extra display area seems like a missed opportunity. This is among the many quirks that make iOS limitations as a productivity platform more apparent, especially compared to Chrome OS and Windows. But theres one I cant get over. Windows and Chrome OS support mouse input, iOS does not. When using Chrome and Slack in split-screen mode on the iPad with my nice keyboard and that 4K monitor, I still had to reach for the iPad to, you know, do anything. Switching between apps, navigating Slack. All of it required touch input. It left me helplessly wondering out loud repeatedly what is the point? On the other hand, there was one magical experience. I took my USB-C card reader, plugged it into the iPad, and it immediately recognized my SD card and offered to import my photos. It was faster smoother than on Windows or macOS. So yes, some aspects of the iPad Pros USB-C support are overblown. Monitors and hubs dont work well, and thats disappointing, But when the iPad Pro does do USB-C right, its pretty special and makes me wish Apple would finally, FINALLY, bring mouse support to its touch-based operating system. This is the first iOS product to incorporate USB-C, so Im not surprised its not perfectly implemented. We can only hope that Apples serious about the promise of USB-C and will keep improving how it works on its tablets.","The USB-C port on the new iPad Pro is a big deal.

John Timmer,"Enlarge / Don't mind us, just performing some alchemy here. reader comments 0 Thunderstorms have a lot of overt indications of power, from the thunder and lightning to torrential rains and hail. But the full extent of their power wasn't obvious until recent years, when we discovered they generate antimatter. Now, researchers in Japan have looked at this phenomenon more closely and determined that a lightning bolt generates a zone that contains unstable isotopes of oxygen and nitrogen, leading to series of radioactive decays over the next minute. Transformative All of these phenomena are powered by the fact that the electric fields within thunderstorms are able to accelerate electrons to extremely high energies. Whenever these electrons move along a curved path, they emit radiation that's proportional to their energy. As a result, a storm can be associated with bursts of gamma rays, extremely high-energy photons. Gamma rays rays are primarily noted for their interaction with the electrons of any atoms they run into—it's why they're lumped in the category of ionizing radiation. But they can also interact with the nucleus of the atom. With sufficient energy, they can kick out a neutron from some atoms, transforming them into a different isotope. Some of the atoms this occurs with include the most abundant elements in our atmosphere, like nitrogen and oxygen. And, in fact, elevated neutron detections had been associated with thunderstorms in the past. But a team in Japan managed to follow what happens with the transformed atomic nucleus. To do so, they set up a series of detectors on the site of a nuclear power plant and watched as thunderstorms rolled in from the Sea of Japan. As expected, these detectors picked up a flash of high-energy photons associated with a lightning strike, the product of accelerated electrons. These photons came in a variety of energies and faded back to background levels within a couple of hundred milliseconds. But about 10 seconds later, the number of gamma rays started to go back up again, and this stayed elevated for about a minute. In contrast to the broad energy spectrum of the initial burst, these were primarily in the area of 500 kilo-electronVolts. That happens to be the value you'd get if you converted an electron's mass into energy. Unstable What's going on here? The researchers suggest that this is a product of the atoms left behind when neutrons were ejected. In the case of the most common isotope of nitrogen, 14 N, this leaves behind 13 N, which is unstable and has a short half-life. The same is true for 15 O, which is left behind when the most common form of oxygen kicks out a neutron. These unstable isotopes will typically decay in a matter of seconds, which is right about the time frame for the afterglow the researchers were detecting. (The neutrons that are kicked out typically recombine with other atoms. For example, adding a neutron to 14 N causes it to kick out a proton, which forms a hydrogen atom. The remaining nucleus is 14 C, a relatively long-lived radioactive isotope of carbon.) The 500keV photons the authors were seeing weren't a direct product of the radioactive decay. Instead, 13 N and 15 O decay by releasing a neutrino and a positron, the antimatter equivalent of the electron. These positrons will then bump into an electron in the environment and annihilate it, converting each of the particles into a gamma ray with the energy equivalent of the electron's mass. That's exactly the energy the researchers were detecting. The authors suggest that a lightning bolt creates an entire region in the atmosphere enriched with unstable nitrogen and oxygen, which they managed to detect as it drifted over their sensors: ""A region, or ‘cloud,’ filled with these isotopes emits positrons for more than 10 minutes and moves by wind above our detectors without experiencing much diffusion, owing to a low mobility of the isotopes,"" the team wrote. This doesn't mean that thunderstorms are major radiation risks. But over time, the storms collectively provide a small influence on the isotopes that comprise Earth's atmosphere. We're apparently not just limited to the carbon that was here when the Earth formed; instead, we've made a bit of our own since. Nature, 2017.

Jennifer Ouellette,"Enlarge / Bombing of a factory at Marienburg, Germany, on October 9, 1943. reader comments 1 The Earth's electrified upper atmosphere (the ionosphere ) experiences a lot of natural variation, changing with the days and from season to season. The ionosphere can also be affected by certain big events, including solar flares, volcanic eruptions, lightningand the massive bombs dropped on Germany during World War II. Those bombings produced shockwaves strong enough to weaken the ionosphere right near the edge of space. That's the conclusion of a new study by University of Reading researchers, just published in the journal Annales Geophysicae. More than a historic curiosity, the finding matters because ionospheric disturbances can disrupt key communications technology, including GPS systems, radio telescopes, and radio communications. The air raids conducted by both the Germans and Allied forces in the 1940s were designed to take out critical industrial and political infrastructureand if civilians happened to be in the line of fire, so be it. (The Allied bombing of Hamburg in 1943 reportedly left 45,000 dead.) Intensifying the fear of dying among residents was as key to the strategy as the physical destruction wrought by the massive bombs dropped. The largest bombs, weighing as much as 10 tons, were powerful enough to blow the roofs off buildings, sending intense shockwaves not just through the streets but into the skies above. ""Residents would routinely recall being thrown through the air by the pressure waves of air mines exploding."" Aircrew involved in the raids reported having their aircraft damaged by the bomb shockwaves, despite being above the recommended height,"" sa ys co-author and historian Patrick Major. ""Residents under the bombs would routinely recall being thrown through the air by the pressure waves of air mines exploding, and window casements and doors would be blown off their hinges. There were even rumours that wrapping wet towels around the face might save those in shelters from having their lungs collapsed by blast waves, which would leave victims otherwise externally untouched. The effects also apparently spread throughout the atmosphere. The ionosphere is composed of three different ionized regions within the Earth's various atmospheric layers (the upper mesosphere and the lower and upper thermosphere, specifically). This means they have a significantly higher density of electrically charged atoms and molecules than the surrounding regions. This happens because the Sun's high-energy X-rays and ultraviolet rays collide with atoms and molecules in the atmosphere with sufficient energy to knock off electrons, thereby creating ions (atoms and molecules with missing electrons) and free electrons. Lacking satellite technology, radio operators at the time often used the ionosphere to boost their signal range, since certain frequencies reflect off the electrically charged particles like a mirror. But the ionosphere is so variable that it was crucial to track its daily changes by sending radio pulse sequences at shortwave frequencies into the sky and seeing how they were dampened or redirected. Enlarge / Bombing of a factory at Marienburg, Germany, on October 9, 1943. Somehow the Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral) survived. The Radio Research Center in Slough keeps detailed records on all this data, which proved a boon to the Reading team. Major and his co-authors studied the ionosphere response records between 1943 and 1945, looking for shifts in height and electron concentration of the ionization in the upper atmosphere over England that may have occurred in response to the bombings. They compared that data with historical records on the approximately 152 Allied raids on Europe during that time frame. London is closer to Slough, but according to Major, German bombings during the famous London ""Blitz"" were so frequent as to be nearly continuous, making it difficult to distinguish which ionospheric effects were due to the bombings and which could be chalked up to the usual seasonal variation. Major and his colleagues found a pronounced decrease in electron concentrationa loss of ionizationin the ionosphere around the time of the air raids, likely due to a heating effect of the shockwaves produced by the bombings. That's a solid proof of principle for the technique in terms of assessing how the ionosphere changes in response to such events. The unprecedented power of these attacks has proved useful for scientists to gauge the impact such events can have hundreds of kilometres above the Earth, in addition to the devastation they caused on the ground,"" says Major.

Patrick Allan,"It’s not a 4th of July celebration without fireworks, and it’s not the day after 4th of July without an Instagram feed filled with people’s terrible fireworks photos. Don’t be like those people. Take decent fireworks photos on your iPhone with these tips. We spent the last week learning all about the basics of photography, from the way your camera works … Read more Read This is all done in iOS’s basic Camera app, so go ahead and access it now. Turn Off Flash First, turn off the flash completely. It’s the lightning bolt icon in the top left corner when you’re in portrait mode, or in the bottom left/top right corner when you’re in landscape mode. Tap the lightning bolt, then tap “Off.” Enable HDR HDR mode, or high dynamic range, quickly takes three different photos at different exposures: normal exposure, darker exposure, and brighter exposure. Then, it combines them all into a single image that appears more vivid and detailed than any single exposure, which is useful in low light situations (like fireworks time). To turn it on, open the Camera app, and tap the HDR icon next to the flash icon and select “On.” You’re ready to shoot. Use Focus and Exposure Lock When you hear that echoing boom and see flashing colors, it’s time to prepare for your photo spree. Point your camera at the dazzling display, then tap the subject (the fireworks) on your iPhone’s screen and hold your finger there. You should see a yellow square appear, then “AE/AF Lock” a couple seconds later, which means you’ve locked the exposure and focus for what you’re shooting. Now you can snap away without worrying about the exposure and focus automatically adjusting on its own as the show goes on. Adjust the Exposure If Needed If you lock the focus and exposure, but think it looks too bright or too dark, you can change it. Tap and hold the sun icon next to the yellow box on your screen and slide up or down to adjust the exposure to your liking. Shoot In Burst Mode When you’re ready to shoot, aim for a pretty explosion, then hold down the big white shutter button. You’ll take a lot of photos really fast that you can go through later (there’s a counter that tells you how many you’ve shot while you hold it). There’s bound to be at least one decent shot from every burst. Remember to hold still as much as you can while you shoot! Or, Shoot Video Then Screenshot a Single Frame If that sounds like too much work, there’s an easier option: shoot a video of the fireworks display, then screenshot a good frame later. Simply take a video with the Camera app, then watch it in full screen on your iPhone. When you see a frame you like, pause it, wait for the controls to fade away, then press the Lock and Home buttons simultaneously. Your firework “photo” will appear in your camera roll.","It’s not a 4th of July celebration without fireworks, and it’s not the day after 4th of July without an Instagram feed filled with people’s terrible fireworks photos.

Jake Krol,"Belkin isn't the only one in these parts with an Apple-approved battery pack. Smartphone accessory manufacturer Mophie announced on Thursday that it's about to raise the bar by introducing four MFi power packs that are exclusive to Apple. That means Mophie’s Powerstation, Powerstation XXL, Powerstation Plus, and Powerstation Plus XL are the first portable chargers available with Apple’s MFi approval. But potential buyer be warned: All of these products carry that signature hefty Mophie price tag for their nice design and relatively large sized battery.

You can count on it to provide you with an extra 20 hours of battery. The larger Powerstation XXL has a 20,200mAh battery with three USB ports and promises an extra 70 hours of battery life. Though both models sport an aluminum outer shell, the standard Powerstation comes in XXL only comes in black. The powerstation cost $59.95, and powerstation XXL comes in at $99.95. Nice Powerstations you've got there, Mophie. Image: mophie The Plus models both have a built-in Lightning connector, which means that if you happen to forget your cable at home one day, you're not out of luck. But that built-in cable comes with a minor tradeoff: There's only one 10W fast-charging USB-A part. The Powerstation plus has a 6,040mAh battery, while the Powerstation plus XL has a 10,000mAh battery. To put the respective 6,040mAh and 10,000mAh batteries in this packs in perspective, the iPhone X has a 2,675mAh battery.

They can light things on fire while fixing the three biggest problems with traditional lighters: Fuel - This lighter doesn’t need fuel; you recharge it over USB. How cool is that? Wind - Since it’s using tiny electrical coils to create heat rather than an open flame, it can’t be blown out.

Ron Miller,"In a time where every startup seems to be using machine learning to sift through massive amounts of data, Scalyr is a cloud-based service that is taking a different approach. It has built a tool the founder claims can sort through massive amounts of log data at lightning speed when compared to conventional logging tools — and it doesn’t require machine learning to make it happen. Today, the company announced a $20 million investment led by Shasta Ventures with participation from previous investors Bloomberg Beta, Susa Ventures and Heroic Ventures. Today’s money brings the total investment to $28 million, according to company CEO and co-founder Steve Newman. Newman has been around the block a few times in the startup world including helping create the Writely word processor, which was purchased by Google in 2006 and became none other than Google Docs. As part of the Google team, Newman says he worked on the data storage infrastructure behind Google Docs and Google Drive. As you can imagine, this involved operations at large scale in a cloud environment, just the kind of scale and complexity so many teams are facing now. Newman took that experience and used it to help create Scaylr, which the team built from the ground up for simplicity and speed, not using so much as a single line of open source or external code. It was all in the service of speed, he says. Log tools continually collect data about what’s happening across a company’s infrastructure and can help track down a variety of problems from network slow-downs to cyber attacks. The challenge is is sifting through the rapidly ever-growing volume of data inside these logs. Just how fast are they? Newman claims Scalyr is at least 5 times faster than competing tools like Splunk, Loggly and Sumo Logic, and sometimes as much as 1000 times faster. He says Scalylr is capable of searching a terabyte of data every second and that it can answer an engineering query 96 percent of the time in one second or less. That speed enables a rapidly iterative process where engineers can get at the root of the problem simply by asking a series of questions based on what they are seeing in the logs and Scalyr’s responses. What’s more, they didn’t just concentrate on the technical underpinnings. He said they also used their experience building consumer application like Writely to develop a tool with a quality user interface. The company is based in San Mateo and currently has 23 employees, a number they are very likely to increase with the new money. Scalyr has 140 paying customers including Giphy, TiVo and Business Insider.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Sound and light have way more in common than you think, which is why it’s easy to turn light data, like radio waves, into sound. This can make for some pretty incredible science communicating tools—just look up Jupiter’s whistlers, falling bomb sounds caused by the planet’s lightning; or the chirp of LIGO’s gravitational wave detection, an ascending bloop as two black holes collide. Now you can listen to plasma waves rushing past Saturn toward Enceladus. It kind of sounds like a whooshing chaos: Sound and light both travel as waves. Sound consists of vibration through a medium, and light is electromagnetic radiation through space. Both have frequencies—which we interpret as color in light waves and pitch in sound waves—as well as amplitudes, meaning brightness or loudness. Radios work by taking sound, converting it into an electromagnetic wave called a radio wave, and then decoding it to make a sound wave again. In this case, scientists measured these waves of plasma, or electrically charged particles, at a frequency that humans can hear. You’re essentially listening to a converted version of the plasma around Saturn. That’s why it sounds, well, pretty incoherent. Converting non-audio information to sound is called sonification, and is often used to help people better understand scientific results, but is occasionally used by artists or musicians. The data comes from a pair of papers published in Geophysical Research Letters, reporting on observations of the plasma around Saturn during Cassini’s final orbits. Both papers find that Saturn’s rings and its moon Enceladus have a measurable impact on the planet’s own ionosphere, the layer of its atmosphere with charged particles. Our Moon does not have such an effect on Earth’s ionosphere, according to a NASA release. What can you do with sound creations like this? Well, you can use them to help better conceptualize the strange phenomena of space. Or maybe you can get one of your more musically inclined friends to write a song.

Brian Heater,"Sphero was ready to conquer the world last year. The company quintupled its product release schedule, flying high with the help of a Disney licensing deal that gave the world several Star Wars droids and talking Spider-Man and Lightning McQueen robots. But following a holiday season that failed to live up to expectations, the company recently laid off 45 staff members globally, TechCrunch has learned, a move it says has impacted departments company-wide. The majority of the layoffs were centered in the company’s Colorado headquarters, but staff cuts also affected its global offices in the U.K. and Hong Kong. “We restructured our team on Friday to better align with our product needs,” a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch. “As we look to our product development schedule for 2018 and beyond, we weren’t going to go that deep, so we had to make some changes for how the teams were structured.” The move is a step back for the company and a bit of a surprise for those who have been following its trajectory from afar. After participating in Disney’s accelerator back in 2014, the hardware startup got a small investment from the entertainment goliath and began production on a BB-8 toy released alongside 2015’s blockbuster Star Wars return, The Force Awakens. In 2017 alone, the company released new toys based on R2D2, The Last Jedi ‘s BB-9E, Spider-Man and Pixar’s Cars franchise, along with Sphero Mini, a smaller, sub-$50 version of the smartphone controlled ball that started it all. The startup had bolstered its headcount to meet the demands of its much accelerated output. It’s telling, of course, that the layoffs come so soon after the holidays. While not disastrous, the finally tally pointed to the need for a rethink in strategy going forward. “[Sales weren’t] exactly what we had expected,” the spokesperson said. “We still consider ourselves a young startup. It’s the right time to pivot.” The decrease comes as it shifts toward a product roadmap more in line with the pre-2017 days — putting it at closer to one to two products per year. “That might be our sweet spot,” the spokesperson added. “We’re still pretty young, but the one part of our business that continues to shine is what we’re doing in education. This allows our company to focus on that vision.” This restructuring finds Sphero investing much more of its existing resources into the education side of its business. The company has been operating in the category for some time, leveraging its hardware creations in an offering designed to target schools, but that side has largely taken a backseat to Sphero’s more commercial offerings until now. Educational robotics — STEM/STEAM specifically — is an extremely competitive space, as well. CES last week was overloaded with companies big and small pushing into the category with a variety of different platforms, and from the looks of things, next month’s Toy Fair in New York won’t be much different. But Sphero has the marked advantage of building on top of its own popular robotics platform. In fact, it ran popular pilot programs in its native Colorado that garnered coverage in places like Wired and The New Yorker last year and in 2016. T he company’s SPRK+ Education offers educators and parents a platform for teaching coding and robotics. Sphero’s package lets kids program its connected toys through coding, offering a real world robotics platform on the cheap. “[Education] is something we can actually own,” the company’s spokesperson says hopefully. “Where we do well are those experiences we can 100-percent own, from inception to go-to-market.” Sphero co-founder and CTO Ian Bernstein also recently left the company to spin out out a new startup, Misty Robotics. It isn’t designed to be a direct competitor, focusing instead on home assistant robotics, but former staffers did join Bernstein at the new company. Misty will also have its own programmable robot, though its offering, the Misty I, is focused primarily on adult developers.","Sphero was ready to conquer the world last year.

Michael Hardy,"For the past decade, photographer Mitch Dobrowner has spent a few weeks every summer pursuing extreme weather across the midwestern United States with veteran storm chaser Roger Hill, who, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, has witnessed more tornadoes (more than 650) than anyone in history. During their first outing, in 2009, Dobrowner and Hill spotted a high-precipitation supercell thunderstorm in the Black Hills of South Dakota at noon and followed it all day in Hill's eight-seater van until giving up the chase at midnight in Valentine, Nebraska. ""It looked like a spaceship,"" recalls Hill, who runs Silver Lining Tours, which offers 11 storm-chasing outings each year. ""Hail the size of grapefruits, lightning strikes every three or four seconds."" Dobrowner's black and white images of that megastorm are some of the most spectacular in his ever-expanding portfolio of extreme weather photography. Although tornadoes get all the attention on TV, Dobrowner is more interested in supercells, massive storm systems that sometimes spawn tornadoes. ""I see them as living things,"" he says. ""Some are gorgeous and beautiful, some are tornadic and violent. And the longer they last the more form they take. Eventually, they mature and die. So I try to take a portrait, almost like with a person."" Unlike some storm chasers, Dobrowner isn't a thrill-seeker. He wants to capture the majesty, not the danger, of extreme meteorological events. ""I know they're destructive at times, but I don't want to photograph that,"" he says. ""I'll leave that to others who are really good at that. I see them as beautiful phenomena."" Riding along with an expert like Hill allows Dobrowner to focus on his craft. ""There's a lot of chaos going onthere's wind, there's lightning, there's noise, hail. And the composition's constantly changing, so you have to really focus on what's going on around you,"" Dobrowner says. ""I'm just listening for when Roger says, 'We gotta get out of here.'"" Growing up on Long Island, Dobrowner says he had no real conception of such severe weather events until he left home at 21 to drive across the American Southwest. Even today, after years of shooting storms, he sometimes finds himself awestruck by the scale of nature's wrath. ""It's like being in front of King Kong,"" he says. ""I don't get scaredI feel kind of honored to be standing in front of it. Sometimes I don't even photograph the storm because I just want to enjoy it.""

Canadian Press,"TORONTO — The Toronto Maple Leafs recalled goalie Michael Hutchinson from the American Hockey League on Friday.
The 29-year-old had a 2-3-0 record with a 2.64 goals-against average and a .914 save percentage in five appearances with the Leafs after he was acquired from the Florida Panthers in late December.
Hutchinson was pressed into service at the time with No. 1 goalie Frederik Andersen and backup Garret Sparks both nursing injuries. In 23 games with the AHL’s Toronto Marlies this season, the native of Barrie, Ont., is 14-5-3 with a 2.70 GAA and a .910 save percentage.
In 111 career NHL appearances with Toronto, Florida and the Winnipeg Jets, Hutchinson owns a 46-43-13 mark with a 2.70 GAA, a .908 save percentage, and four shutouts.
Leafs head coach Mike Babcock said earlier this week Andersen would start the final two games of the regular season. The Dane made 26 saves in Thursday’s 3-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning. Toronto wraps up its schedule Saturday in Montreal against the Canadiens.
Toronto is preparing the face the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs next week. The Leafs fell to their Atlantic Division rivals in seven games at the same juncture last spring.
An emergency recall the first time he was summoned to the NHL by Toronto, Hutchinson would have to pass through waivers to be sent back down to the AHL.","Maple Leafs recall goaltender Michael Hutchinson from Marlies Sportsnet.ca Lightning get 61st win, defeat Maple Leafs to move one from record NHL.com Mistakes cost Leafs in hard-fought loss to Lightning TSN Stamkos, Lightning trip up Leafs to become 2nd team …",2019-04-05T13:46:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sportsnet.ca'}",Maple Leafs recall goaltender Michael Hutchinson from Marlies - Sportsnet.ca,https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/maple-leafs-recall-goaltender-michael-hutchinson-marlies/,https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NHL-Maple-Leafs-Hutchinson-in-net.jpg,,Sportsnet.ca,lightning,1

This isn’t the first time that the issue of homophobia has cropped up in connection with NHL hockey.
Anaheim Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf was fined $10,000 after he uttered a remark in a 2017 playoff game against the Nashville Predators.
“There was obviously some words said, not necessarily directed at anyone in particular,” Getzlaf said at the time.
“I’ve got to be a little bit more responsible for the words I choose. It’s tough to see someone refer to it as [homophobic]. I didn’t mean it in that manner in any way.”
And in 2011, then-Philadelphia Flyers player Wayne Simmonds faced scrutiny for allegedly directing a homophobic remark toward then-New York Rangers player Sean Avery.
The NHL did not suspend Simmonds at the time because it was “unable to substantiate with the necessary degree of certainty what was said and by whom,” said a statement at the time.

Miller Kern,"Apple's included one of its Lighting-to-USB connectors with every iPhone and iPad for the past seven-ish years, and that's seven-ish years too long.
It's not just that the thin cable breaks and frays easily, but at 3-feet long, it's simply too short for practical use. Plugging in a device to charge makes one feel like a leashed kid at the mall: You'd have the whole world at your fingertips if it weren't for that pesky cord.
Misplacing one almost feels like a blessing, because then you at least have an excuse to shop around for a different model say, this 3-pack of cables from the Mashable Shop. Measuring in at an impressive ten feet (each), these cords are more than three times longer than Apple's standard Lightning connector so you'll get plenty of flexibility when it comes time to sync or energize your devices. 
If you head over to the Mashable Shop today, you can pick up a three-pack of 10-foot MFi-Certified Lightning Cables one for home, one for work, and one for your car for just $32.99.

Darrell Etherington,"If you spend any meaningful amount of time in hotels, you’ll know that many of them are still living in the age of the 30-pin adapter, even though most of us have already moved on to Lightning, wireless charging and USB-C. So it’s essential to pack charing equipment to handle any need that might arise – and usually that means a lot of dongles. Nomad’s new wireless USB hub really cuts down on clutter, and makes it easy to charge what you need to charge, when you need to charge it. The hub looks a bit like a sleek bag burger designed by someone who makes luxury car interiors for a living. It sounds like a weird description, but it’s not a bad thing – the black puck is basically at home in any decor, so it’s a good beside companion for home as well as for away. On top, the hub has a wireless charging pad with a 7.5W max output (the max supported input the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and 8 Plus can accept). Inside, however, there’s plenty more in the way of charging options, including one USB C port capable of 3A output, a high-speed 2.4A USB A port for charing up an iPad or the like, and two 1A USB outputs for stuff like AirPods. Each has its own LED indicator (which are faint enough that they won’t disturb even the most sensitive sleeper), and there’s built-in cable management to keep obvious desktop clutter to a minimum. A single 1.2 meter power cable is included and connects to the wall plug to give the hub its combined 30W max output, and rubberized footing gives it a stable stickiness on almost any surface. There’s a matte rubber ring on top, too, which is great for the iPhone X and 8, which can slide gradually off even other non-stick surfaces, even if they’re seemingly lying perfectly flat. In terms of how it works in practice, I used the Nomad Wireless Charing Hub all throughout my recent trip to Las Vegas for the annual CES gigantic crazy consumer tech shitshow and it performed very, very well – in fact, after a colleague took off with my only Lightning cable, it was the only way I could reliably make sure my iPhone was topped up for the next gruelling day of slogging through gadget booths. You can definitely get sleeker, smaller wireless chargers, but at $80 Nomad’s option is only really twice as expensive as a lot of the good options out there, and yet it also packs a lot of additional charging versatility for when you need it. If you’re looking for an all-in-one travel charging companion, this is definitely a top choice.","If you spend any meaningful amount of time in hotels, you’ll know that many of them are still living in the age of the 30-pin adapter, even though most of us have already moved on to Lightning, wireless charging and USB-C.

Sarah Perez,"Following its relaunch earlier this year as a podcast creation platform, Anchor today is bringing its suite of mobile podcasting tools to the iPad. Like its iPhone counterpart, the iPad version of Anchor lets you record, edit, then distribute your podcast anywhere, including iTunes and Google Play Music. The new app is also customized for touch-based editing, and it takes advantage of iPad features like drag-and-drop and multitasking. The company had originally been focused on short-form audio, but more recently realized it could better serve the growing audience of podcasters with a set of easy-to-use tools available right on their mobile device. The iPhone version of Anchor lets you press a button to record your audio, record with friends, insert voice messages (like call-ins) into your podcast, and easily add music and transitions. The iPad app now offers a similar set of tools, with a few upgrades and tweaks. For starters, you can opt use a real microphone by plugging one into your iPad’s lightning port, or by using a lightning-to-USB adapter. You can also upload or even drag and drop audio files from other apps into Anchor for use in its episode builder. For example, you could pull in music from GarageBand, add a voice memo, or import other audio files saved in a cloud storage site like Dropbox. The app support multitasking, too, so you can keep your notes open as your record. And you can directly edit the audio files on the iPad itself using touch-based controls that are easy enough for anyone – even novice or amateur podcasters – to use. The controls allow you to trim the beginning and end of your podcast, so you can cut out issues like false starts or other chatter. And you can split audio clips in order to insert transitions, voice messages, music, and other audio. The clips can then be moved around or deleted as you put your podcast together. Given the popularity of podcasting today, it’s actually fairly remarkable that no one else had yet introduced audio editing tools built with the needs of podcasters in mind. The Anchor app is also another example of how the iPad can be used for content creation, not just consumption – and specifically, how it can be used as an editing tool for creative projects. Anchor for iPad, like the iPhone app, is free to use as the company is currently living off its funding. But the longer-term plan is to offer monetization tools to Anchor’s podcasters, where Anchor itself would likely take a cut of revenues.","Following its relaunch earlier this year as a podcast creation platform, Anchor today is bringing its suite of mobile podcasting tools to the iPad.

Terrence O'Brien,"Pull off the rubber side panel and you'll find a charging jack; USB, USB-C and micro-USB ports; plus an SD card slot. Any media you insert, be it a card or a thumb drive, is automatically backed up the Copilot's disk. And a large monochrome screen on the front lets you know just how much storage you have left. It's perfect for shooting tons of footage in the field and quickly backing it up without having to fumble with a laptop. You can even view or edit your footage from a mobile device thanks to the integrated Lightning and micro-USB cables. Just connect your iPad and you can start pouring over your 6K drone footage, while the battery keeps your tablet charged up. Even more interesting, you can daisy chain other drives off the Copilot. While it's connect to your computer, just plug another external drive into the Copilot's USB port and you'll be able to access all its data. Now, because of all these features the Copilot isn't exactly tiny. It's definitely small enough to toss in a bag, but you wont be slipping this into a coat pocket or a purse. And it's not going to be cheap. The Copilot is going to cost around $349 when it ships sometime this spring.

Harrison Weber,"The hell, Apple? For the first time since the iPhone maker prematurely killed the classic headphone jack, Apple revealed on its website that it’s going to stop handing out those annoying little dongles for free. Eliminating the headphone jack back in 2016 with the iPhone 7 prompted such panic that some people literally drilled holes into their phones, mostly satirically, to bring the classic port back. Two years later, we’ve sort of gotten used to the routine of using lightning headphones, losing them, and turning to the dongle before that too is lost. But now you won’t get the chance to lose it, unless you’re looking to fork over $9 first for an official Apple Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter. In the end, this is just going to push more people to wireless, which is both a boon to Apple and also probably an inevitability regardless of the courtesy dongle. But Apple, with all its cash, can afford to do us a solid. It could and should keep doling out dongles for a little while longer to the people who will need them. That would be cool, Apple.

Nick Kelly,"TAMPA — Forward Yanni Gourde did not have time to waste time in the locker room after the Lightning's victory over Montreal. He needed to go find Benjamin Roy.
About 12 hours earlier, Gourde was showing Roy, 8, around the room and introducing him to other players. During their time together, Gourde told Roy that he would give him the puck if he scored a goal later against the Canadiens.
That, however, was a big if. Gourde made that promise while in the middle of a 10-game goal-scoring drought.
But he had Roy to play for now.
Roy, a Quebec native who has a brain tumor, wrote Gourde a letter asking to meet him, drawing a picture of him and Gourde on the back. Thanks to Make-A-Wish Quebec, Gourde made good on that letter Saturday when the Lightning faced the Canadiens.
In addition to spending time with Gourde in the morning, Roy had the opportunity to be the ""Thunder Kid"" for the game. Wearing a Lightning uniform, Roy skated out on the ice to amp up the crowd while AC/DC's Thunderstruck played. He then stood next to Gourde for the anthems.
Forty-two minutes later, Gourde deflected a puck into the Montreal net.
The same puck he later handed Roy, fulfilling his promise.
""It was a special night for me,"" Gourde said. ""It was a special night for him. A special day. It was so much to have him around.""
Some odds and ends from the game:
Club 100. While fulfilling a promise, Gourde also reached a personal milestone. The goal was his 100th career NHL point.
Still no goals, but Mikhail Sergachev is contributing offensively. The defenseman set up C Tyler Johnson's goal with a terrific pass in the second period. Sergachev has tallied 13 assists this season.
Welcome back, Anton. D Anton Stralman missed more than a month with an injury, but he has become a solid offensive contributor since his return. He has tallied at least a point in three of the past five games. He scored a goal to tie the game at 2-2 in the first period Saturday.
King Kucherov. F Nikita Kucherov remains atop the NHL with 63 points. He scored his 18th goal of the season in the second period. He extended his scoring streak to 10 games, one game shy of a career long.
A December to remember. The Lightning has not lost in regulation in December, improving to 12-0-1 Saturday. It's a franchise record for wins and points (25) in one month. The Lightning also extended its point streak to 14.

Star Trek 4 Speaking with IGN, Chris Hemsworth stated he hasn’t heard anything about a fourth Star Trek— in which he was meant to make a time-bending return as George Kirk, the dead father of Chris Pine’s James Kirk—following Quentin Tarantino’s alleged takeover of the franchise: I don’t know. It’s a reminder to call J.J. and ask the same question because I haven’t heard any updates on it either. Avengers: Infinity War In another interview with IGN, Hemsworth also stated he feels a “renewed sense of excitement and enthusiasm” at the prospect of potentially playing Thor in future Marvel movies, now that his contract is done. I’ve just, literally two days ago, finished Avengers 4 and that’s my contract – my preexisting contract is done now, so it’s kind of like, ‘Wow, that’s it.’ Two or three films ago I was like, ‘Okay, a couple more.’ I was enjoying it but I was like… I felt a little restricted. And after this last experience with Taika, and actually these last two Avengers, I feel like we’ve reinvented the character a number of times – even in these next two, he evolves again, and you don’t get that opportunity often in a franchise.

It’s a big episode with some big stuff, and they really went with my ideas. Coming from indie film, I’ve really done something that’s at the farthest end of different and still is the same concept. It was like doing a mini-Marvel movie. It’s that episode, as people will see, that’s a little bit like our version of Downton Abbey-meets-a very bloody, sci-fi version of Gladiator.

We still don’t know who Jessica Chastain is playing [in X-Men: Dark Phoenix ], do we? I heard a rumor this week. What if—and forget the pronouns here—what if Jessica Chastain was playing Mr. Sinister? That’s the rumor. I don’t know what that means. I don’t know who Mr. Sinister really is, but that’s a possibility. It’s a possibility. In competing Mr. Sinister movie rumor news, a separate article detailing the troubled production history of New Mutants from The Tracking Board suggests Antonio Banderas would instead be playing the character, replacing a previously planned Jon Hamm: Meanwhile, remember the Essex Corporation that was teased at the end of X-Men: Apocalypse ? Well not only was New Mutants going to feature that mysterious company, but The Tracking Board has learned that Jon Hamm was originally going to appear as Mr. Sinister in a tag at the end of New Mutants, and Boone filmed material that led up to that reveal, only for Fox to change their minds after shooting had been completed. Now it’ll be Antonio Banderas playing an unspecified villain (one who isn’t expected to be Mr. Sinister) in the New Mutants tag. Maybe the real Mr. Sinister was simply the friends we made along the way. Naruto The Greatest Showman director Michael Gracy gave Collider an update on his live-action adaptation of Naruto.

But I think the great thing is that everyone involved, from Lionsgate to the producers, are all of the same mind. Everyone knows how precious this property is and to me it’s incredibly exciting, and I love the work that I’ve gotten to do on it to date. At this stage, no one is going to go into production until we’ve got a script that excites everyone. So whether it’s my next one or not, I don’t know. We’ll have to wait and see.

Steve Dent,"Those ""different other options"" might include new laws. Incompatible phone chargers inconvenience consumers and contribute 51,000 tons of electronic waste every year in Europe, the EU Commission estimated back in 2009. In 2009, 14 companies including Apple, Samsung and Huawei signed letters agreed to use micro-USB chargers as standard in Europe. Though many did adopt that system, a notable exception was Apple, which went with its own Lightning standard. Europe threatened to draft a law forcing the issue, but backed off when companies signed letters of intent promising to keep working on a standard. If the study recommends it, the EU may create a law forcing everyone to use the same type of charger. The bloc has taken similar action in the past to reduce waste. It forced product manufacturers to provide two-year guarantees covering the cost of repairs, including shipping. It's also looking at making repairability ratings local repairs mandatory. The goal is to reduce the number of devices and appliances that get chucked into landfills because of ""programmed obsolescence.""","The European Union has been trying for nearly a decade to get smartphone manufacturers to voluntarily agree to a common mobile phone charger.

Patrick Holland,"Close-up of Lightning (left) vs. USB-C (right) connectors. Sarah Tew/CNET Believe it or not, the launch of the 2012 iPhone 5 was highly controversial for two reasons. The first one -- the replacement of the Google-powered Maps app with Apple Maps -- was rendered moot when a proper Google Maps app came to the phone three months later. But the sting of the second took longer to wear off: The 30-pin connector that had long been a staple of the iPod, iPad and iPhone line was summarily killed off with the surprise transition to the new Lightning connector. In 2012, Schiller says the iPod 30-pin connector, which launched in 2003, has served the company well for almost a decade. James Martin/CNET Lightning had a lot going for it: It was smaller, faster and reversible. But for the owners of tens of millions of instantly obsolete accessories, it was a painful, acrimonious conversion. It took years for people and businesses -- especially hotel alarm clocks -- to transition away from the mighty 30-pin connector. Flash forward to 2018. With new iPhones presumed to arrive in September -- less than 90 days from now -- the iPhone rumor mill is in full swing. And the latest one is that that Apple might adopt USB-C on future iPhones. That could mean one of two things: USB-C ports could replace Lightning ports on the phone, or USB-C power cables and a wall charger might be included with the next iPhone instead of USB-A ones. To be clear: The latter is much more likely, if there's even any deviation from the status quo. Why USB-C power cables and chargers would be great If iPhones shipped with a Lightning-to-USB-C cable you could plug them into newer MacBooks and USB-C battery packs without the pain of using an adapter. This combo would also allow you to fast-charge your phone. Indeed, to be clear, the USB-C power solution for Apple products already exists. Buy a USB-C-to-Lightning cable ($25, £25, AU$35) and a 30W USB-C power brick ($49, £49, AU$69), and your iPhone will charge the battery to 50 percent within roughly 30 minutes. (From top-to-bottom) Apple's Lightning connector, a USB-C connector and a USB-A connector. Patrick Holland/CNET But like the aforementioned hotel alarm clock, there could be annoying real-world circumstances where you still need a USB-A cable or adapter -- charging on a plane, or the dozens of other places where the classic rectangular USB-A port has become the closest thing we have to a worldwide electrical outlet standard. I'm more interested in the possibility that Apple might drop the Lightning port in favor of a USB-C one for future iPhones. However impossible it might be -- and it's pretty impossible -- the advantages would be worth it. Just one connector, give it to me My Mac has USB-C ports, so does my Nintendo Switch. It would be incredibly convenient to just need one type of cable to charge them and my iPhone. USB-C is widely used on Android phones, tablets and PCs and is found on new peripherals such as external hard drives and displays, and new cameras such as Panasonic's popular GH5. USB-C supports a variety of connections like USB 3.1 and the bonkers-fast Thunderbolt 3, which can reach speeds up to 40 gigabits per second. Currently, Lightning on the iPad Pro is capable of USB 3.0 speeds, which top out at 5Gbps. Physically, USB-C is slightly larger than a Lightning connector but could fit in the existing iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X body design. And imagine if you need to borrow a cable to charge your phone: You could ask both friends with iPhones and those with Android phones to borrow theirs. Despite my dreams of a USB-C utopia, a USB-C iPhone would have to overcome many real-world obstacles. Lightning on the iPhone is here to stay As convenient as a ""universal"" connector would be, it's highly unlikely that Apple will dump Lightning in favor of USB-C. A downside to having a Lightning-to-USB-C cable included with future iPhones is that nearly all USB power ports are designed for USB-A. Patrick Holland/CNET USB-A is the unquestioned standard for USB power and data connections. If Apple were to put its weight behind USB-C, that would be a major signal to the industry to begin a consolidated transition. That's exactly what happened once Apple backed the Qi wireless charging standard with the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X in 2017. People hate connector changes. When the original 30-pin connector was dropped in favor of Lightning, there was a lot of brouhaha about having to buy new cables and adapters from Apple. A similar backlash happened in 2016 when Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone in favor of Lightning. Apple's push to have one connector for everything on the iPhone shows how committed it is to Lightning. Also, not all USB-C connections are made the same. This can be confusing. For example, if you're buying a USB-C-to-headphone jack dongle, there are several kinds and not all will work with all phones. Lightning feels like a tighter physical connection than USB-C. I was editing video on a new MacBook Pro via a USB-C-connected external hard drive. Occasionally, when the cable was nudged, the hard drive disconnected. Whereas I've seen people hold their iPhone up from a connected Lightning cable like a prized fish on a line. Apple values slimness, and despite the similar size, Lightning is still thinner than USB-C. Apple also loves wireless and introduced AirPods at the same time it dropped the headphone jack. It makes sense that the company would drop the Lightning connector when wireless charging is fast enough to be a viable alternative. So… yeah. My hopes for a USB-C iPhone are likely just that. In the meantime, I will keep my fingers crossed for a USB-C cable and charger to be included in the box with the next iPhone. Even if that means I'll need a dongle to charge it on a plane.

Dan Seifert,"The best thing about the iPhone XR is not its design, processor, camera, or even its fun colors. The best thing is the XRs battery life, which lets me use the phone all day without ever having to worry about charging it. Many days, I go to bed with 50 percent left in the tank.
So it came as a bit of a surprise to see Apple announce a new Smart Battery Case for the iPhone XR a few weeks ago. The Smart Battery Case, which is also available for the iPhone XS and XS Max, sells for $129, comes in black or white, and is designed to dramatically extend the time you have before you have to plug your phone into a wall charger. Apple says the iPhone XR version of the case extends talk time to 39 hours (from 25), internet use to 22 hours (from 15), and video playback up to 27 hours (from 16). Thats a significant jump from the XRs already impressive stamina, but since Apples battery life estimates can be tough to translate to real-world use, I decided to use the new Smart Battery Case with my iPhone XR for a week to see what it could really do.
The design of the new case is similar to the original model that came out for the iPhone 6S and 7, but it has a longer hump on the back that extends to the bottom of the phone. Theres no getting around the fact that the case adds considerable thickness and weight to the phone even the smaller iPhone XS turns into a veritable chunk when the case is on. The larger iPhone XR and XS Max are legit thicc bois with their respective cases, which makes them a bit harder to handle and easily slip in and out of a pocket.
Yes, it is possible to use the iPhone XS Smart Battery Case on an iPhone X, even though Apple does not explicitly support it. The iPhone X does fit in the XS case, though theres a little gap around the camera housing and it isnt quite as snug. Additionally, the speaker and microphone holes on the bottom of the case do not precisely line up with the iPhone Xs hardware, so audio quality for calls might be diminished.
The gummy silicone finish on the case not only makes it tough to slip into a pocket, but it also collects a ton of dust and gets greasy with fingerprints after just a couple of minutes of use. The silicone does provide an excellent grip, but its a bit too sticky for my preference. Id love for Apple to release a leather version of this case, but Im not confident that will ever happen.
The new cases add some features that werent available before: you can fast-charge the case and the phone, provided you have the right cable and charger, or you can drop the phone in its case on a wireless charger to charge both. Apple says the 5W brick that comes with the iPhone will charge the iPhone first, then the case, while a 10W or 12W charger will charge both simultaneously at 5W. An 18W charger will fast-charge the iPhone first before filling up the case, while 30W or higher chargers will fast-charge both the phone and case simultaneously. On a wireless charger, the iPhone will charge first before the case starts to refill its tank.
The cases have a Lightning port on the bottom that supports data and audio pass-through in addition to charging. You can plug Lightning headphones or a headphone dongle into this port or plug your phone into a computer or car system for CarPlay without having to remove the case. It behaves basically the same way as the Lightning port thats on the phone.
But the reason these things exist is for their battery life, and it is impressive. The Smart Battery Case was able to easily keep my iPhone XR charged at 100 percent for an entire day of rather heavy use. It effectively extends my phones usable life to two days from one; once the case is tapped out, I can just remove it and rely on the XRs internal battery. On one day, I unplugged the phone in its case at 7:30AM, and I didnt have to plug it into a wall charger until around 7:30PM the next day roughly 36 hours, or two full practical days of use.
The thing is, I rarely need that kind of battery life because I often have opportunities to charge up throughout the day, whether thats in my car while Im using CarPlay, on the wireless charger on my desk, or through a charger on my nightstand while I sleep. Its nice to not have to think about charging my phone during the day, but I dont really have to think about it much with the XR as it is, and I dont know if the Smart Battery Case is worth the $129 for my needs. Plus, the added bulk and weight make the XR less pleasant to use during the day. Im much more likely to use an external battery pack on the off chance I do need to charge up, as its much less expensive, has a larger capacity, and can be used to charge devices other than just my phone.
But if youre the kind of user who goes hard on your phone for many hours a day and doesnt have many opportunities to charge up, the Smart Battery Case could be the right tool for you. There are other battery cases on the market, but the Smart Battery Cases integration with iOS, intelligent charging, and ability to pass data and audio through its Lightning port provide a better experience without a doubt as long as you dont mind turning your svelte iPhone into a beefy brick.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"China’s defunct space station Tiangong-1 will soon plummet toward Earth, likely this weekend. You will almost certainly not be harmed in any way by it—the odds of it striking an individual person are worse than winning the lottery or being struck by lightning. You should not worry about it. But we’re humans. We’re all probably wondering, what happens if it becomes clear that pieces of the debris will strike a populated area? This is a long discussion that far predates Tiangong-1. China launched the house-sized Tiangong-1 space station in 2011. It was a prototype that could only hold a three-person crew, and the plan was for it to fall back to Earth in a controlled reentry, meaning scientists would get to pick where it lands. In 2016, China informed the UN that the satellite was no longer functioning, but denied that it lost control of the ship in some more recent reports. Tiangong-1's orbit is decaying as the craft slowly succumbs to Earth’s gravity. A 13-agency consortium including NASA and others, called the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee, has been monitoring the craft’s reentry, while the European Agency posts updates. As of now, the estimated impact window is between March 30 and April 2. Its projected landing spans a region from 43˚N to 43˚S S latitude, a sizable percentage of the inhabited globe. Impact is more likely closer to the edges of that region, which includes nearly every major city in the United States. Again, you are much more likely to die by a million other causes than by a falling spacecraft this weekend. As the ESA writes in an FAQ: “the personal probability of being hit by a piece of debris from the Tiangong-1 is actually 10 million times smaller than the yearly chance of being hit by lightning. In the history of spaceflight, no casualties due to falling space debris have ever been confirmed.” Additionally, this debris will be relatively small compared to other uncontrolled reentries. But if the time does come that space debris threatens American livelihood, it would probably be up to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make decisions. The United States Strategic Command’s Joint Space Operations Center, “provides Trajectory Impact Prediction messages concerning space debris to many locations” informs the FEMA operations centers, “which monitor the data for the FEMA Administrator,” according to FEMA’s National Warning Systems operations manual. The National Warning System “is a 24-hour continuous private line telephone system used to convey warnings to federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government and public safety officials,” a FEMA spokesperson told Gizmodo. The organization pays closer attention to nuclear objects or those that may have poisonous fuels. Once the authorities are notified, they would use the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System to warn people in danger. Warning the right people could be difficult, though—the projected location is wildly unpredictable. As the ESA writes in the same FAQ, “Even 7 hours before the actual reentry, the uncertainty on the break-up location is a full orbital revolution—meaning plus or minus thousands of km!” The strike itself would litter debris spread over an area a hundred miles long and a few miles wide, Harvard Astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell told to Gizmodo in an email. So would a warning even be worth it? “I imagine perhaps if there was a public information plan, it would generate more hysteria than would be warranted for something so unlikely,” Ruth Rand, historian of science, technology, and the environment during the Cold War at the University of Wisconsin told me. “I imagine some people might respond with undue fear and you might have a crisis in your hands.” Instead, it might be better to just give people what information is available, and remind them not to touch and debris with their hands, as it might contain a corrosive fuel called hydrazine. This is far from the first time that a piece of space debris has descended upon our planet—and it’s definitely been worse.. In 1978, a nuclear-powered Russian spy satellite called Kosmos 954 crashed into Northern Canada with little warning, scattering radioactive debris. Skylab dropped some debris in a small Australian town, and the same discussions seem to come up whenever a satellite is slated to crash into Earth, as happened in 2011 when some of NASA’s Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite (UARS) crashed into Earth. Our military has a say, too. The U.S. Air Force’s Joint Space Operations Center tracks objects 10 cm and larger in low Earth orbit and about 1 meter and larger in deep space on space-track.org. U.S. Air Force spokesperson Major Cody Chiles said, “We will continue to monitor this reentry and provide more information when it is available.” The USS Erie shot down failed spy satellite USA-193 with a missile back in 2008. All that is to say, you’ll be fine, and if you’re worried, the government actually does think about things like whether or not a satellite will harm life and property. But if you do get hit and die, take solace in the fact that you’d be the first confirmed death-by-space-debris.","China’s defunct space station Tiangong-1 will soon plummet toward Earth, likely this weekend.

Andrew Freedman,"Just like each of us has our own personality, each nor'easter is different, with its own idiosyncrasies and mood. The rapidly intensifying storm taking shape off the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England on Wednesday, for example, is unusually feisty, with a mean streak. For days now, computer models have locked onto the potential for an unusually widespread display of thundersnow — lightning produced during a snowstorm — due to the strong lift that this storm is going to produce from eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey northward across parts of New York State, on up into southern New England. SEE ALSO: Hang onto your butts as another nor'easter cripples travel, triggers thundersnow These signs have come in the form of meteorological products that are virtually indecipherable to the typical weather consumer, such as model forecast soundings and projections of how much ""convective available potential energy,"" or CAPE, will be present at times. But these indicators have been blinking red, signaling that very heavy precipitation rates, accompanied by lightning and thunder at times, is likely to occur on Wednesday into Wednesday night, potentially in big cities like Philadelphia and New York. The atmospheric lift associated with these storms is key to the forecast for the New York City area, because surface temperatures at the start of this storm have been above freezing at the coast. Thunderstorm outlook for March 7, 2018, showing thundersnow potential in Mid-Atlantic and southern New England. Image: noaa/spc. Meteorologists forecasting up to a foot of snow in New York are counting on a process known as dynamical cooling, initiated by intense precipitation, to turn the rain to snow and cause it to pile up quickly. In fact, if some of the model projections come to fruition, the evening commute could be crippled in the New York City area, as well as Philadelphia and parts of Connecticut. The ingredients for thundersnow are usually different compared to what cooks up a more common summertime storm. For example, summer storms typically form on warm, humid days, and snowstorms obviously lack such heating at ground level. But what they lack in heat they make up for in lift, specifically narrow layers of rapidly rising air. Such lifting is typically triggered by dynamics associated with rapidly intensifying storm systems like the one undergoing bombogenesis, or a process of rapid intensification, south of Long Island on Wednesday. It's this strong lifting, usually in a narrow layer of air below 25,000 feet, that generates thundersnow. Computer model runs show strong areas of lift, associated with the formation of fronts aloft, that will move across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Wednesday afternoon. Meteorologists on Twitter have been impressed by the thundersnow potential. Finally, here is a huge warning sign for later. This morning we are seeing significant CAPE values and convective lifting in the mid levels. If this translates this afternoon in precipitation rates, you have 3""+ snowfalls over these regions. pic.twitter.com/EdbhA9KDdw — NY NJ PA Weather (@nynjpaweather) March 7, 2018 Snowstorms tend to have flat, layered clouds, with most of the precipitation formed in the so-called snow growth layer at relatively low levels of the atmosphere. For thundersnow to occur, the right ingredients need to come together to lift some of these flatter clouds and mold them into protrusions that some meteorologists call turrets. Such turrets protrude like a fist above the the broad and flat layers of snow-producing clouds, driven to greater heights by lifting from approaching weather features. These weather systems may be a deep dip in the mid-level jet stream, known as a trough, that causes air to rise ahead of it, or ascend from the formation of frontal zones within storm systems, known by the fancy term ""frontogenesis."" Both of these factors are present in abundance on Wednesday. For example, this chart of mid-level frontogenesis shows a clear signal that this will occur over the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England during this storm. However, also making Wednesday's storm unique is the presence of an abundance of extremely cold air aloft, which will make it possible for vertically growing clouds to take on a shape that more resembles summertime thunderstorms than more typical thundersnow events. Such storms could produce more lightning than usual, and, as the Washington Post 's Capital Weather Gang noted, the possibility of hail falling at the same time as heavy snow. When the right conditions are present, these turrets can form what's known as elevated convection (elevated because the cloud is not based near the Earth's surface). Within these clouds, large snowflakes mix with icy pellets known as graupel, and electrical charges can build up from static electricity as these particles collide in the turbulent atmosphere. This static electricity buildup eventually can trigger occasional cloud-to-cloud or cloud-to-ground lightning strikes. Areas of thundersnow are typically associated with extremely heavy snowfall rates because the extra lift in such snowbands enhances the production of snowflakes. This is partly why weather geeks love thundersnow so much, it combines heavy snow with lightning and thunder, a combo of the seasons, if you will. Interestingly, because thundersnow occurs as a result of elevated convection, the thunder typically sounds different than the rumbles from an average summertime thunderstorm. Thundersnow tends to be somewhat muffled, influenced by its altitude, the cold air the sound waves are traveling through, and the snow on the ground. Also, most cloud-to-ground lightning discharges during thundersnow events tend to be triggered by human-made structures, like tall skyscrapers like One World Trade in New York, or massive broadcast towers, for example. Such towers can poke into the base of the clouds and cause a buildup of electrical charges.","Just like each of us has our own personality, each nor'easter is different, with its own idiosyncrasies and mood.

Kristen Shilton,"TSN Toronto reporter Kristen Shilton checks in daily with news and notes on the Maple Leafs. The team held a practice at the Panthers Ice Den on Friday. The Maple Leafs have seen a string of divisional opponents in the last week and a half, matching up against the Buffalo Sabres, Detroit Red Wings, Boston Bruins and Tampa Bay Lightning. Torontos record has been average at 1-2-1, including a pair of three-goal losses to perennial playoff contenders in the Bruins and Lightning. Those unfavourable outcomes sting a little more for the Leafs, who had high expectations for themselves in both meetings. Its a long season but, those are games you want to win and its a sour taste and probably a little frustration when you dont get the result you want, said John Tavares after the Leafs practice on Friday. They are obviously big, important games. There is a lot of jockeying for position; all the teams have high expectations. Overall, the Leafs are 4-4-1 against the Atlantic this season, and theres a chance theyll end up pitted against a division rival in the first round of the playoffs. The players arent looking that far ahead when there are important lessons to learn from recent disappointments. Those points are important, we know that, said Morgan Rielly. But that being said, its a long year. Theres time to make those up. I think when you look at those games, its a good chance to kind of use as a measuring stick to judge where you are, and I think thats good. Looking back on Thursdays 4-1 loss in Tampa, the Leafs felt like they had the game under control, but were stymied by Lightning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy in a 48-save performance. I think when you look at the tape from last game, we did a lot of good things and there are things we can take away from that, Rielly said. We played with a lot of good tenacity, we were quick, I thought we were on top of them, added Tavares. We didnt allow them to get as much sustained pressure that theyre capable of with the talent and the depth. So well just stick with that, keep making plays. For his part, head coach Mike Babcock is striving to not let his team get too caught up in the divisional race. Every game adds up exactly the same, he said. I think there are some teams that, because of their level, youre more interested in beating just because of the emotional side of it. In the end they all add up the same. Leafs have a 'sour taste' in their mouth after losses to Lightning and Bruins The Maple Leafs know the importance of games against the Bruins and Lightning and admit they're a bit frustrated after losing both of them. But they know it's a long season and are looking to get back on track when they visit the Panthers on Saturday. Kristen Shilton has more. ---- The Leafs went 0-for-6 on the power play in Thursdays loss to the Lightning, stoned by Vasilevskiys impressive showing in net and some key blocked shots by Tampa penalty killers. Toronto being blanked in that area has been a common theme lately in four of their last five games the Leafs have produced zero goals with the extra man, going 1-for-18 overall. The loss of key power-play pieces from seasons past like Tyler Bozak and James van Riemsdyk forced adjustments by the Leafs, but Babcock is confident this year's units will get into a consistent rhythm. I dont think [those losses] affected one [power-play] group at all, its just that we had two groups last year, Babcock said. Were going to have two groups here too. Willy [Nylander] is working his way back; once Willy gets going, well have two groups as well. Those guys were important players on the power play for us, but were just a different team. Weve given different people more opportunity I would say. Tavares has taken on a less familiar power-play role as Torontos net-front presence in his first season with the Leafs. With four goals and three assists on the man advantage to date this season, Tavares is pleased with his impact, even as the Leafs are struggling to put pucks in the net. When you have the skill sets we have on our power play, its a pretty good spot to be in, he said. Thats where the puck is going to end up going, where the goals are scored, so I know Ill be around it, and Id like to continue putting them in when I get my chances. Its been good. Being in that area of the ice on a power play does subject Tavares to more physicality than other positions might, but it has its perks too. I think youre going to be engaged a little bit more around the net by some of the defencemen, he acknowledged. Thats where goals are scored, but thats an easy price to pay when youre getting these kinds of opportunities. ---- Zach Hyman will step back into the Leafs lineup on Saturday after serving his two-game suspension for interference on Bruins defenceman Charlie McAvoy. Its only been a week since he last played an NHL game, but Hyman said it feels like it was a longer forced break. It felt like a month, Hyman said of the time away. I miss playing hockey. I miss being out there with the guys. Now that hes eligible to play again, Tavares is eager to add Hyman back onto his line with Mitch Marner. There is so much trust in his game, so much predictability, hes so strong on the puck, so good in those 50-50 battles there, said Tavares. With those ones you think hes probably not going to come out of it, he just finds a way. Puts a lot of pressure on the D with his speed and his strength, so hes a presence around the net and you can really count on him defensively in our own zone. Leafs Ice Chips: Hyman says suspension felt like a month Zach Hyman has served his two game suspension and will be back in the lineup on Saturday in Florida. Hyman admits it felt like a lot longer than two-games and his teammates are looking forward to his return. ---- Maple Leafs lines at practice: Hyman-Tavares-Marner Johnsson-Matthews-Kapanen Marleau-Kadri-Nylander Ennis-Lindholm-Brown Gauthier Rielly-Hainsey Gardiner-Zaitsev Dermott-Ozhiganov Marincin-Holl Andersen Sparks",Leafs have 'sour taste' after losses to division rivals TSN Maple Leafs Notebook: Hyman’s suspension ‘felt like a month’ Sportsnet.ca The Lightning Stone the Maple Leafs: Who Was That Masked Man?

Associated Press,"TAMPA, Fla. — Andrei Vasilevskiy made 48 saves in his return from a broken left foot and the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-1 on Thursday night in a matchup of the NHL’s top two teams. Alex Killorn and Tyler Johnson both scored for Tampa Bay during the final 36 seconds of the second period to make it 4-1. Vasilevskiy, who missed the previous 14 games, stopped all 23 shots he faced in the period. Anthony Cirelli and Nikita Kucherov also had goals for the Lightning (25-7-1), who have won eight in a row and lead Toronto by eight points in the Atlantic Division. The franchise record is a nine-game winning streak in 2016. Tampa Bay scored three times on 12 shots in the second. Killorn put home a backhand with 35.8 seconds left, and Johnson converted from the slot with 1.7 seconds to go. Toronto got a goal from Kasperi Kapanen, and Frederik Andersen stopped 17 shots. The Maple Leafs have lost three of four (1-2-1) after a five-game winning streak. Vasilevskiy got his glove on Patrick Marleau’s point-blank chance and then trapped the loose puck with his pad early in the third. The Maple Leafs hit the crossbar or post three times in the first and Vasilevskiy made a left pad save on John Tavares’ in-close backhand late in the period. Nazem Kadri had a nifty deflection stopped by Vasilevskiy and also hit the post during a power play midway through the second. Tampa Bay took a 2-1 lead on Kucherov’s power-play goal at 5:31 of the second that required a video review. A no-goal call on the ice was overturned when officials determined Andersen’s glove save came behind the goal line. Kucherov also had an assist and has six goals and 29 points over the last 15 games. Kapanen put the Maple Leafs up 1-0 after stealing an errant pass into the slot by Kucherov 5:26 into the game. Cirelli tied it on his third short-handed goal at 8:20 of the first. NOTES: Toronto (15-1-1) lost for the first time in regulation when scoring first.. Marleau played in his 738th consecutive regular-season game and passed Jay Bouwmeester for the seventh-longest streak in NHL history..

Jeremy Berke,"This artist's concept of lightning distribution in Jupiter's northern hemisphere incorporates a Juno image with artistic embellishments. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/JunoCam NASA's Juno probe has unraveled the mystery of Jupiter's lightning — a problem that has vexed astronomers for close to four decades. While ""Jovian Lightning"" had been theorized for centuries, it wasn't until 1979 that NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft flew by Jupiter and confirmed the gas giant experiences lightning. Jupiter's lightning, however, appeared different than thunderstorms here on Earth. When lightning strikes, it acts like a radio transmitter, blasting radio waves with each strike, according to NASA. But the lightning recorded by Voyager 1, and subsequent missions by other NASA spacecraft, didn't match the usual frequency of terrestrial lightning, confounding scientists. A new paper published by NASA's Juno team in the journal Nature has found that Jupiter's lightning is actually much more similar to Earth's than previously thought. ""Until Juno, all the lightning signals recorded by spacecraft were limited to either visual detections or from the kilohertz range of the radio spectrum, despite a search for signals in the megahertz range,"" Shannon Brown, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a lead author on the paper, said. ""Many theories were offered up to explain it, but no one theory could ever get traction as the answer."" Juno is unraveling Jupiter's mysteries. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Gerald Eichstadt/Sean Doran On Earth, radio waves associated with lightning are in the megahertz range. Before Juno — which has been orbiting Jupiter since the summer of 2016 and has more sensitive instruments than older probes — the lightning on Jupiter was only recorded in the kilohertz range. According to Brown, Juno picked up radio signals from Jupiter's lightning in the megahertz range experienced on Earth. ""We think the reason we are the only ones who can see it is because Juno is flying closer to the lightning than ever before, and we are searching at a radio frequency that passes easily through Jupiter's ionosphere,"" Brown said. The team's finding was corroborated in a second paper, also published in Nature. There is a key difference between Jupiter's lightning and Earth's, however. On our planet, lightning storms are clustered in the tropical regions around the equator. That's because warm air allows moisture to rise more freely through the atmosphere, fueling the thunderstorms that produce lightning, according to NASA. On Jupiter, lightning is clustered in the polar regions — it's ""inside-out"" relative to Earth, Brown said. Though Jupiter receives 25 times less sunlight than Earth, the Sun's rays do still heat up the gas giant's equator more than the poles. The Sun's heat creates just enough stability in the upper atmosphere around Jupiter's equator to inhibit the rise of warm air, preventing lightning-bearing clouds from forming above the planet's equator. Jupiter's poles, which aren't warmed by the Sun, have a less stable atmosphere, according to NASA, which allows warm gases to rise and create the recipe needed to produce lightning. ""These discoveries could only happen with Juno,"" Scott Bolton, another author on the paper said. ""Our unique orbit allows our spacecraft to fly closer to Jupiter than any other spacecraft in history."" Luckily for the scientists, NASA is extending the Juno mission through July 2021.","NASA's Juno spacecraft has made an astonishing discovery about Jupiter 's lightning strikes: They're similar to Earth's.

Associated Press,"WASHINGTON — Tampa Bay Lightning defenceman Dan Girardi is out indefinitely with a lower-body injury.
The team announced Girardi’s status Tuesday before visiting the defending Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals. Girardi has missed the past five games.
Coach Jon Cooper says the 34-year-old’s absence means the Presidents’ Trophy-winning Lightning will continue to rely on midseason acquisition Jan Rutta.
Tampa Bay also is without defenceman Anton Stralman, who has missed the past six games with a lower-body injury. Cooper says Stralman won’t play on this three-game road trip at the Capitals, Carolina Hurricanes and St. Louis Blues but is a possibility to play next week.

Hudson Scott,"In the midst of their toughest stretch of the season after losing five-of-eight since Christmas, the Toronto Maple Leafs are up against undoubtedly the league’s best team while looking for a rebound game on the road against a division rival (7:30 p.m, SN Ontario).
According to MoneyPuck, through 47 games, the Lightning are already at 99.9% probability of making the playoffs. With 73 points, theyve already collected more than the final points total of six NHL teams in 2017-18. 
If we drop the lockout-shortened season by the Blackhawks in 2012-13, you have to go back to the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings and 1970s Montreal Canadiens teams to find a points percentage in the neighbourhood of the Lightnings current .787. Take into account its now a hard-cap era of parity and its even more stunning.
The Lightning are at or near the top in most major metrics and, while they took at a save percentage dip through December, it’s hard to find an area where they haven’t excelled this season. They’re one of the only teams that is in the top ten in both shot attempts for and against. They haven’t ridden their percentages all that much, either — their expected goals for and against are closely in line with their actual goals for and against. For the most part, they’ve earned everything they’ve gotten. 
The Leafs seemed up for the challenge last time they visited Tampa Bay maybe their most impressive game of the season at 5v5 spoiled by a Herculean goaltending performance by Andrei Vasilevskiy. After the loss, the Leafs rattled off five wins in their next six games. Since then, the Lightning have kept on winning while the Leafs have fallen on hard times in their last 10, at least relative to the lofty expectations in the Toronto market (5-5-0). 
The Leafs will shuffle their lines around tonight looking to spark an offense that should be converting far more often than it is during the recent stretch of mediocre play. Theyll reunite the Hyman-Matthews-Nylander line who spent 640 5v5 minutes together last year (first on the team) and dominated, while shifting Andreas Johnsson to the Tavares-Marner line, where hes been effective in a small sample this season. Kadri will skate in between Marleau and Kapanen a trio that is famished offensively right now across the board.
The Leafs have lost 11 of 24 on home ice including five of the last six, with the last game bringing out some boo birds at the Scotiabank Arena. Getting out on the road for this Sunshine State back-to-back may just be what the doctor ordered. A win tonight would go a long way toward shutting the door on the creeping doubts of late about the teams viability as a true contender.
Game Day Quotes
Mike Babcock on the thought behind changing up the lines, and how he sees the team moving forward:
It hasn’t gone as good as we’d want. I think moving the wingers around is more about let’s just get to work and play fast and let’s play hard. If you don’t to that against this team, it’s going to be ugly anyway — so we’ve got to play well. I thought we played well last time we played them, but we’ve to work and play fast and do things right. Anytime anything gets stale, you’ve got to change it around a little bit. We’ve done that a lot here as of late.
I think adversity is a wonderful thing. I think you’ve always got to be careful wanting it, and then when you get it, you don’t want to have it. But when you don’t have it, you say ‘we probably need some adversity’. That’s all great to say, but today’s a new day. Let’s play.
Babcock on the team’s last meeting with Tampa:
I just thought we played quick. They’re going to be quick here tonight. It’s two good teams. It’s about execution, but if you can establish your game first and you can on top of the other team, they have less room. If they get on top of you, you have less room. It just kind of snowballs on you.
Babcock on Andreas Johnsson’s recent play:
Well, I think Johnny works. The greatest thing, no matter how much skill you have, if you put your work before your skill, you have a chance to be happy most nights. The players that elevate themselves to be really, really good players are all workers. They just flat out work. They work away from the rink, they work at the rink. I think [Johnsson]’s doing a good job for us.
Lightning head coach John Cooper on the Leafs:
Toronto’s got a good team and we’ve got a good team, so it’s two good teams playing hockey. We probably weren’t as prepared for them as they were for us, and it was eye-opening to see how good the Leafs really were. If it wasn’t for a herculean effort by our goaltender, that game may have been different.

Andrew Liszewski,"Back in 2014, we were duly impressed with the inCharge, which made it easy to keep a tiny emergency USB charging cable on your keyring. Four years later, its creators have found a way to improve the inCharge with a new version featuring a connector that works with both Lightning and microUSB ports so you don’t need to carry a separate cable for your non-Apple devices. The original inCharge featured a clever design with slim magnetic USB connectors tethered by a short cable so that when you were done syncing or charging a device, you didn’t have to wind up (and potentially damage) three feet of unnecessary cable. It wasn’t designed to replace the longer charging cable on your bedside table, but it was about as small and portable as a USB cable could get. An all-in-one Lightning and microUSB cable is a smart idea, and potentially a familiar-sounding one, because back in 2016 another company tried to crowdfund a similar solution. The LMcable ultimately had its funding suspended by Kickstarter, and no products were delivered to its backers, so why should you trust the inCharge Dual Indiegogo campaign to deliver? You shouldn’t. You should be skeptical of every product that goes the crowdfunding route, because there’s hundreds of things that can go wrong when bringing a piece of tech from the concept to final product stages. Pledging hundreds of dollars to products promising unproven technology demo’d in a nifty video is not a sound investment, but the creators of the inCharge Dual are selling their new cable for just $6 on Indiegogo. They’re not exactly reinventing the wheel either, just bringing a clever and useful upgrade to an existing product which they already successfully crowdfunded four years ago. A single cable that can replace the USB rat’s nest I keep in my bag? Sounds like it’s worth the risk.","Back in 2014, we were duly impressed with the inCharge, which made it easy to keep a tiny emergency USB charging cable on your keyring.

Caleb Kraft,"While doing some research on very low frequency (VLF) receivers and radio propagation, I came across an amazing website curated by Charles Wenzel. It is called Technical Library, or TechLib for short. It has all kinds of interesting electronics projects and experiments, and I highly recommend bookmarking it for future reference. I made the “Basic Lightning Receiver” for the Maker Faire Bay Area in 2016. It is housed in a broken LCD TV cabinet, as seen below. I removed the broken screen and most of the circuit boards and parts. At first I thought I could reuse the existing remote to turn the unit on and off, but the TV had many multi-function ICs and I decided it wasn’t worth trying to figure out how to cut up the board and circuits. I did keep the pair of speakers for the sound portion of the detector though. All components are common and may be found in your junk box, with the possible execption of the TL-431 three terminal adjustable shunt regulator (voltage reference). These are readily available from your favorite parts supplier. The TL-431 is also known as the NTE999. Construction is not critical (with one exception that I’ll mention later) and parts can be laid out in any fashion you wish. This is a perfect project to stimulate your creativity in packaging and construction techniques. The TechLib website includes a great gallery of “Readers’ Projects,” including some amazing lightning detectors that are truly works of art. My new version lightning detector / 300 kHz receiver is built into a project box rescued from the recycle bin and features a tape measure antenna. The BNC connector at the top left is for an external (larger) antenna. A “wall wart” 5V power supply plugs into the cabinet on the rear panel. This allows more room inside for future modifications or circuit additions. The tape measure antenna is insulated from the chassis box (ground) using 6-32 hardware and nylon shoulder washers. Two pieces of bamboo barbecue skewer are held in place with heat shrink tubing to stiffen the lower part of the tape measure antenna. The images below show what’s inside the project box. As you can see, the circuits are simple and not too many parts are needed. By the way, I learned something while building this version of the detector: The tuned circuit is influenced by the magnet in the speaker, so this is possibly the only “critical part” about parts placement – make sure the inductors (coils) are not too close to any “magnetic” parts, such as the speaker and, possibly, the power supply transformer. How it Works Lightning flashes and Tesla coils generate a wide range of radio frequencies near 300 kHz, slightly below the AM broadcast band (540 kHz to 1700 kHz). The electrical impulses can be perceived as “noise” or “static” in a radio receiver. The lightning detector is a “resonant tank circuit” which detects lightning electrical impulses, amplifies them so the noise can be heard on a speaker, lights an LED and moves the needle on the meter. A lightning simulator is used to test or demonstrate the unit in action when no storms are in the area. It is a low frequency, low level oscillator. Another way to simulate lightning is to use a piezo electric striker, like the ones used in some cigarette lighters and gas barbecue starters.

Chris Johnston,"TORONTO — In the event there was still any question about what the standings tell us about the balance of power in the Atlantic Division, the Tampa Bay Lightning left no doubt about their dominance here on Monday.
Its always nice to play against them and see where we are, Nikita Kucherov had said of the Toronto Maple Leafs before puck drop. Its a good challenge for us.
The Lightning made it look like no challenge at all.
Tyler Johnson scored twice while Andrei Vasilevskiy turned aside 26 shots as Tampa cruised to a 6-2 victory.
It wasnt even a case of their stars shining brightest, although Kucherov had an assist to pad his league-leading point total at 111. The other goals came from Cedric Paquette, with two, Anthony Cirelli and Ondrej Palat.
Toronto played two of its best games this season in Tampa — winning 4-2 on Jan. 17 and losing 4-1 on Dec. 13 — but heard boos from a restless Scotiabank Arena crowd on this night.
The Leafs simply didnt have much jump a day after returning from a swing through Western Canada that concluded a stretch where they spent 20 of 30 days away from home. That excuse wont hold water with head coach Mike Babcock, who refuses to see the first game back from a trip as a hurdle: I would if it was someone else coming off of one, but today I dont at all. I think its just a great opportunity.
The Lightning are a ridiculous 53-13-4 for a reason: They move the puck around sharply, have unrivalled depth from top to bottom and a Vezina Trophy candidate in Vasilevskiy.
Theyre a fast team, were a fast team, so its two very good teams, said Tampa defenceman Victor Hedman. The way to stop that is having good gaps and dont turn pucks over.
The Lightning also found some good fortune on Monday with goals that pinballed off shinpads and defenders. In the process, they managed to chase Frederik Andersen for only the second time all season after Palats bouncer made it 4-0 at 4:50 of the second period.
Auston Matthews provided a brief shot of hope when he carried the puck through the neutral zone, danced around a backchecking Brayden Point and beat Vasilevskiy between the legs. But Paquette was left wide open for a short-handed response after Leafs goalie Garret Sparks failed to leave his crease to play the puck, creating a 3-on-1 for Tampa.

Robbie Gonzalez,"Another day, another SpaceX launch. On Monday at 4:30 pm ET, the commercial space company is slated to propel a previously-flown Dragon cargo ship into low Earth orbit aboard a used Falcon 9 rocket. The Dragon spacecraft, which is carrying food and supplies for the International Space Station, is scheduled to dock with the orbital outpost on Wednesday. The cargo run will mark SpaceX’s 14th resupply mission to the ISS, its seventh Falcon 9 launch this year, and its second such launch in less than a week. Last Friday, one year to the day after launching and landing a used rocket for the first time, the company deployed a used Falcon 9 rocket to send 10 Iridium telecommunications satellites into orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. (SpaceX has now launched five missions for Iridium, but it has only used three boosters—the power of recycling!) On the other side of the country, the Dragon capsule currently awaiting liftoff from Pad 40 at Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station is loaded with close to three tons of grub, gear, and research equipment. Among these are the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor —a suite of of optical cameras, photometers, and an X- and gamma-ray detector designed to study upper-atmospheric lightning and its relationship relationship to Earth's climate, and a nice complement to [the Geostationary Lightning Mappers aboard NASA's next generation weather satellites](https://www.wired.com/story/noaas-goes-s-satellite-is-a-game-changer-for-severe-weather-forecasts/. Also aboard are the Veggie Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System (an experimental method for growing food in microgravity), and the Multi-use Variable-g Platform, aka ""MVP,"" a temperature- and humidity-controlled artificial gravity machine about the size of a microwave, with space inside for a range of biological samples, from cells, to fish, to flatworms. About 10 minutes after Monday's launch, the Dragon will deploy its solar arrays and begin firing its thrusters with its sights set on the ISS. From aboard the space station, NASA astronaut Scott Tingle will assist Japanese astronaut Norishege Kanai in capturing the Dragon capsule with Canadarm2, the 58-foot-long robotic grappling arm, and mating it to the station's Harmony module. There, it will spend approximately one month before detaching and returning to Earth. But the most noteworthy thing about Monday's resupply mission isn’t the launch itself. It won't be SpaceX's first time using a recycled rocket in a resupply mission. Neither will it be its first time lofting a previously flown Dragon capsule, let alone its first time reusing both major components simultaneously. In truth, the most significant thing about the day's cargo run may be that there is little novelty to it whatsoever. Which is, of course, SpaceX's grand vision: To make rocket launches repeatable, reliable, quotidian. To achieve that vision, it'll need to up its launch cadence, which it appears to be doing: In 2017, the company launched 18 rockets. If Monday's liftoff goes as planned, it'll have seven on the year already, putting it well on track to exceed last year's high-water mark.

Steve Dent,"All of the car's prodigious torque can be sent to the back wheels to make them swing out in order to maximize track speeds. At the same time, power can be quickly transferred to the front wheels if things get out of hand. The system also boosts the regenerative braking power and uses the brakes to simulate a limited-slip differential. Motor Trend tested the Model 3 Performance with an early version of Track Mode a few months ago, and, to the distress of Tesla's engineers, beat it with an Alfa Romea Giulia Quadrifoglio. In Motor Trend's rematch with the new software, however it thumped the latter car by a second and a half and matched the $86,000 Porsche Cayman GT4. Motor Trend test driver Randy Pobst noted that Track Mode gives the driver more control, while carefully balancing the torque between the front and rear motors. ""According to Tesla's calculations, Track Mode lets the car apex earlier and begin accelerating sooner,"" he said. ""This simple ballet is kept carefully balanced from entry to exit by the lightning responsiveness of the electric motors and brake pads."" The Track Mode Release Version software is now available for owners of the Model 3 Performance.

MLHS Staff,"The Toronto Maple Leafs fired a season-high 49 shots on goal but couldnt solve Andrei Vasilevskiy in an encouraging effort with a frustrating result against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Thursday night. Scattered thoughts: – The game ground down to a bit of a crawl as it petered out, but the first two periods lived up to the hype of the first seed and the second seed going toe to toe. It was fantastic entertainment between two teams who are the best in the league when it comes to playing fast, transitioning from defense to offense, and completing skilled play after skilled play at high speeds. – From the Tampa Bay Lightning broadcast announcers in the third period: I dont think weve seen the Lightning spend this much time on their own side of the red line all season. 49-21 Toronto in shots by the end, the Leafs outshot and out chanced (high danger) the Lightning in each period at 5v5 and drew six power plays to boot (thats more than what they drew in five games combined between Nov. 24-Dec 1). If the Leafs played this same game 10 times, they win eight or nine of them. It was about as good of a game as the Leafs have played this season as far as exiting the zone cleanly/efficiently and establishing their forecheck — and generating turnovers off said forecheck — consistently over 60 minutes. There was nothing to be ashamed about with the effort at 5v5 in this one. The Leafs should take a lot of positives out of this as far as their belief about how a potential playoff series might play out. – There was nothing to hang your heads about if youre the Leafs, but there should be some frustration about the manner in which they shot themselves in the foot. The shorthanded goal against was inexcusable a horrible first power play in general, but William Nylander skated straight into traffic when the puck shouldve been laid off to Tyler Ennis on the wall for the easy entry and the 4-1 goal right at the end of the second period was a total backbreaker that was also avoidable. The momentum had turned after the Leafs didnt cash in (somehow) on all of their second-period power plays and the Leafs gave one up to Alex Killorn (wouldve been nice to get a save there, but Hainsey and Nylander played it poorly as well). At that point, they just needed to get out of the period alive. Mike Babcock went with his fourth line and third pairing with 30 seconds left in the period and the Tavares/Marner line was rested enough to go out. A bit of a head-scratcher there. More than who Babcock put out there though, it was a strange time for Travis Dermott to take a gamble like he did (and he didn’t get himself back in the play properly after the turnover). – Havent seen a goaltending performance like the one out of Andrei Vasilevskiy in this game in a long time he stopped 47 straight shots after Kasperi Kapanen scored on the Leafs second shot of the night. Its not like the Leafs made it easy on him loads of tips/deflections, second/third opportunities, tons of action at the net. Not among the shot total because (for some reason) they dont count as shots on goal: The Leafs hit four posts. This save summed up the Leafs and Vasilevskiys night: This highlight reel save from Andrei Vasilevskiy sums up tonight's game for the Leafs. #LeafsForever #GoBolts pic.twitter.com/e9h2aoYGv5 — Maple Leafs Hotstove (@LeafsNews) December 14, 2018 Just one of those evenings. – Mentioned William Nylanders turnover earlier for Anthony Cirellis 1-1 shorthanded goal, but really that was the culmination of a horrible first power play from the Leafs in which they got handily outworked by the Lightning PK units. Youve got to approach your battles and play with the same level of urgency as you would at 5v5 against the talent the Lightning put out shorthanded and how hard-working their units are. A Lightning forward in full possession of the puck down low in the Leaf zone tried to set up a chance for a Tampa defenseman in the high slot twice on that first power play. The Leafs got no less than they deserved there. That said, on the first two power plays of the second period, its unbelievable the Leafs didnt score at least one. A full two-minutes of in-zone possession, zipping the puck around, completing seam passes to the backdoor only for a desperation stick/block or a ridiculous Vasilevskiy save to shut the door, time and time again. The Leafs are now 0 for their last 12 on the power play, and there is some adjusting to do, but they should’ve had a couple PP goals in this game. – Pretty obvious that the Leafs special teams lost them the game as they were responsible for the 1-1 and 2-1 goals. On the penalty kill leading to the 2-1 Tampa goal, the Leafs were basically giving up free one-timers to Kucherov; Andersen stopped the first one and nearly came up with a miraculous save on the second one, but it edged over the line. The Lightning power play is built around the two one-time options for Stamkos and Kucherov; you’ve got to give up something, so it’s about picking your poison. With Hedman in possession up top, Marner had his stick in the lane to Stamkos on the goal, but Hainsey and Lindholm were doubling up on the bumper play, giving up a free passing lane and clean looks for Kucherov in the left circle. 10th in the league the last two seasons, the Leafs PK dipped below 80% (79.6, 15th) after the game. – Whatever the gene is that allows certain athletes to rise to the occasion in the big game, Kasperi Kapanen clearly has it. We all know the history golden goal at the WJCs, goal vs. Pittsburgh to clinch the Leafs playoff berth in 2017, the goals vs. Washington in his first NHL playoff series, the Game 7 goal versus Boston and those are certainly bigger moments than game #32 of the regular season vs. Tampa, but his start to this game was impressive, to say the least. He had a 2v1 chance that hit the crossbar (the Leafs started the game crossbar – shot on goal – goal for their first three attempts). He then caused the chaos just before the 1-0 goal to chase down and out battle Victor Hedman on the puck race before jumping on a turnover from Nikita Kucherov and burying his 12th of the season. I love what I'm seeing from the Auston Matthews line early on. But this goal wouldn't be possible without the speed and pressure of Kasperi Kapanen. This forces a turnover that he takes full advantage of. 1-0 Leafs. #LeafsForever #GoBolts pic.twitter.com/VZL1s4Kl6p — Maple Leafs Hotstove (@LeafsNews) December 14, 2018 – This pattern is interesting from a player with Steven Stamkos injury history. Stamkos fined $5K for this dangerous trip on Morgan Rielly. pic.twitter.com/PEUrIIsYwB — Flintor (@TheFlintor) March 21, 2018 Appears that Steven Stamkos slewfooted Morgan Rielly on that last shift. No call. #LeafsForever #GoBolts pic.twitter.com/zUcbwEpxzo — Maple Leafs Hotstove (@LeafsNews) December 14, 2018 The first one got him a fine of $5,000, so it should be on the leagues radar. – When Par Lindholm has played on the fourth line either centering or on the opposite wing of Tyler Ennis (~60 minutes of 5v5 time), they’re at 40% CF together and have been outchanced 28-12. They scored against Carolina, but the concern here is there is no clear identity on the Leafs fourth line anymore — it’s neither a skilled enough line nor a heavy enough line when these two make up 2/3rds of it. Doesn’t necessarily mean everything on its own, but Lindholm’s ten goals against (zero for) in 55 minutes of kill time is the worst in terms of total goals against and per 60 goals against of any Leaf forward. Credit where it’s due, he’s been better in the faceoff circle shorthanded than Tavares and Hyman have been (and won three straight on the Lightning’s first PP of the game), but he’s still figuring out his spacing.

Chaim Gartenberg,"Logitech’s Crayon stylus became the first Apple-sanctioned iPad stylus option, aside from the Apple Pencil, when it was announced at Apple’s iPad-focused education event in Chicago earlier this year. But there was just one problem: the devices were only sold directly to schools, not the general public. That changes today. Logitech is announcing that it will now sell the Crayon to everyone through Logitech’s website and Apple Stores starting today and with more general availability at other retail locations in October. The Crayon is also getting a price hike for the public: it’ll now cost $69.99, instead of $49.99 for education customers. It still only supports the latest 9.7-inch iPad The rest of the Crayon is still the same: it doesn’t need to be paired via Bluetooth, but it can still measure angle, manage palm rejection, and offer comparable precision to the Pencil (although there’s no pressure sensitivity). As an Apple-approved MFi-certified charger, it even charges via a built-in Lightning port, which is convenient. It can last about seven hours on a charge. Logitech says that the Crayon is only compatible with Apple’s most recent sixth-generation iPad, not the iPad Pro or older iPad models.

Built in the first years of the 20th century, Wardenclyffe Tower served as the centerpiece of a real-life mad scientist’s laboratory. Lever pulling, lightning bolts, maniacal laughter—this is where that sort of thing was supposed to happen. And it almost did. That mad scientist’s name was Nikola Tesla whose mission was to create a way to send wireless electricity as far as London. Thanks to funding from Wall Street luminaries like JP Morgan, the lab itself could have been the birthplace for our wireless future. The only problem? The cupola and its ambitions were destroyed due to a few poor business decisions and a lot of bad luck, long before Tesla could realize his dreams. The early days of wireless technology were marked by struggle and confusion but also glory and Earth-shattering instances of scientific achievement. Wireless technology is brutally difficult. Progress from the first theories of electromagnetic waves to the first telegraph signal didn’t happen in a matter of years. It took decades. Advancing from sending little chirps across a waterway to connecting vast networks of computers over the air took well over a century. But innovation tends to snowball. In the past few years, we’ve seen rapid advances in everything from cellular communications to wireless power and ideas as wild as using lasers to beam internet down to Earth from space. To understand what’s next, however, you have to understand how we got here. The early days of wireless technology Wireless communication has served as the lynchpin of modern society since the invention of the telegram. You could almost attribute the technology to Paul Reuter, who enlisted pigeons to carry stock quotes between Berlin and Paris in the mid-19th century. (After all, pigeons are technically wireless.) In the years that followed, however, a new technology called wireless telegraphy entered its nascent stages. Wireless telegraphy—also known as radio telegraphy—involves transmitting radio waves through the air in short and long pulses. These “dots” and “dashes”—also known as Morse Code—were then picked up by a receiver and translated into text by a receiving operator. Put bluntly, this new method of communication enabled humans to communicate over vast distances with relative ease. In order the understand how this new form of communication works, it helps to understand the early history. The origins of wireless technology can be pegged to the year 1865, when Scottish scientist James Clerk Maxwell published a paper about electric and magnetic fields. “ A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field ” is now regarded as a foundational work of physics that not only laid the groundwork for wireless communications but also served as the starting point for Albert Einstein’s research into relativity. Maxwell correctly theorized that these electromagnetic waves could travel at the speed of light and, in 1873, published a set of equations (Maxwell’s equations) that would serve as the foundation of all electric technology. Things really got interesting, however, when other scientists started putting Maxwell’s equations into practice. Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of electromagnetic waves in a series of experiments from 1886 and 1889. However, after essentially building the world’s first radio—a badass gadget known as a spark gap transmitter —the German scientist actually thought it was all pretty boring. “It’s of no use whatsoever,” Herz said at the time. “This is just an experiment that proves Maestro Maxwell was right—we just have these mysterious electromagnetic waves that we cannot see with the naked eye. But they are there.” Turns out they were pretty useful. The international unit now used for frequency in radio waves, of course, is named after Hertz. What followed Hertz’s experiments was a flurry of invention and innovation. The two biggest names that emerged in the final years of the 19th century were Guglielmo Marconi, who was primarily interested in wireless communications, and Nikola Tesla, who saw great promise in wireless electricity. Broadly speaking, Marconi is credited with building the world’s first radio station and marketing the world’s first wireless telegraphy equipment in the late 1890s. But in those same years, German scientist Ferdinand Braun was doing similar work using an induction coil designed and patented by Tesla. Marconi and Braun would go on to win the 1909 Nobel Prize for their accomplishments in wireless telegraphy. Tesla, quite famously, was not so lucky. The scientist had remained resolute in creating a viable technology for wireless power. But after he failed to produce a viable wireless power transmitter with the Wardenclyffe Tower at his Long Island laboratory, Tesla died penniless in Room 2237 at the New Yorker Hotel, 34 years after the Nobel Prize was awarded to Marconi and Braun. That same year, 1943, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Tesla’s 1897 patent for a transmitter and receiver, which predated Marconi’s inventions, tacitly acknowledging Telsa’s pioneering contributions to the invention of telegraphy and radio technology. Perhaps more significantly, it was Tesla’s contributions that have proved more long-lasting and relevant to wireless technology today. “Tesla actually goes a long way in thinking about how you’d send thousands of messages in its own frequency,” W. Bernard Carlson, author of Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Ag e and a history professor at the University of Virginia, told Gizmodo in an interview. “Marconi was really broadcast technology which wasn’t really desirable for military purposes or other purposes.” And as we’ll see, sending multiple messages on the same frequency would become absolutely integral to the development of wireless technology in the decades after Tesla. Audio, video, disco The first wireless transmitters in the late 1890s ushered in a century of innovation. While wireless technology effectively amounted to sending a single for a few miles, Victorian-era technologists would soon learn how to wireless transmit signals carrying audio, video, and eventually any type of data over any distance. By 1920, William Edmund Scripps started broadcasting “Detroit News Radiophone” over the radio, and a year later, the Detroit police introduced mobile radios into squad cars. In 1927, a General Electric lab in Schenectady, New York would become home to the world’s first television station, where high-powered radio frequency transmitters could send a signal carrying audio and video to a three-inch-by-three-inch screen about three miles away. These are all major moments in the history of wireless technology, but with the exception of the police radios, none of it was mobile. Broadcasting was also, by definition, a one-way stream of data. Then, along came an invention called Motorola. Produced by the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation, the Motorola radio became the world’s first car radio-phone in 1930. The two-way communicators were first adopted by police departments, and later, a more advanced and compact version called the “Handie Talkie” would earn historical importance for its role in World War II. The device’s official model number was SCR536. Suddenly, all of these wireless gadgets are starting to look familiar to 21st-century gadget enthusiasts. They were handheld, battery-powered, and pretty fucking cool. However, long-range mobile communications still required a crippling amount of hardware to be dependable. In 1943, Galvin released the Motorola SCR300—also known as the “Walkie Talkie”—a hulking, 35-pound FM radio device with a range of 10 to 20 miles that was worn like a backpack and sometimes required two people to operate. You probably remember seeing these in Saving Private Ryan. This idea had legs. FM (frequency modulation) radio was patented a decade before the Walkie-Talkie’s release and quickly gained popularity over its predecessor AM (amplitude modulation), since FM radio could carry higher quality audio transmission. So Galvin latched on to the idea that a two-way FM radio would be great for people to talk to each other. Taxis started using two-way Motorola radios in 1944, and after the war, in 1946, Motorola introduced the world’s first car phone : the Motorola Radiotelephone. The following year, Galvin changed its company name to Motorola. It wasn’t long before a whole infrastructure developed around this technology. The Bell System teamed up with Western Electric around this time to create the General Mobile Radiotelephone Service. Using VHF (very high frequency) equipment and FM radios, this service divided itself into two systems: one for highways and one for cities. The necessary equipment was actually built into the car itself, with batteries under the hood, a transmitter in the trunk, and a handset near the driver’s seat. Motorola, General Electric, and others built similar systems. A wide range of increasingly smaller devices started hitting the market in the 1950s. Eventually, radio-powered mobile phones could fit inside of a briefcase. These were appropriately called “briefcase phones,” and people thought they were really next level at the time. It wasn’t until the late 1960s that Bell Labs developed Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) technology and laid the foundation for cell phones as we know them today. Put more bluntly, AMPS blew the lid off the barn. The original radio telephones are now known as 0G mobile phone technology. AMPS became 1G. The cellular revolution Motorola researcher Martin Cooper made the world’s first handheld cellular telephone call on a New York sidewalk in 1973. The device was very similar to the grey, brick-sized behemoths our parents used way back when, and it weighed a hulking two-and-a-half pounds. Battery life sucked, too—apparently, it lasted just 30 minutes and took 10 hours to charge—but it was enough for Cooper to call Joel S. Engel, his rival and head of AT&amp;T’s cellular program. “Joel, I’m calling you from a cellular phone, a real cellular phone, a handheld, portable, real cellular phone,” Cooper said. Martin’s troll was a historic one. Bell Labs had been working on AMPS since the 1960s, and the system promised endless possibilities, including the possibility that a countless number of people could place phone calls, over the air, on the same frequency without any interference. In fact, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) set aside the 40MHz spectrum in 1974 for cellular technology, thereby carving out a specific lane for this type of wireless communications. The concept behind cellular technology was sound, but progress was slow. Essentially, cellular technology divided geographic areas into—you guessed it—cells. Each cell hosts a base station, as well as a tower with an antenna on top. Depending on the technology, a cell tower can pick up a signal from up to 25 miles away. If the end user is on a call and traveling, the tower sending and receiving the signal can hand off the transmission to another tower as needed. (This process is called—you guessed it—a handoff.) This is why you’re able to talk on a cell phone while driving down the highway and not drop a call. It’s not perfect, but it’s a hell of a lot better than the best two-way radio. The first cell phones were not technology meant for the masses. The FCC approved a commercial model of the DynaTAC in 1983, and a year later, Motorola sold the device for $3,995. (In 2017, that’s close to $10,000 when adjusted for inflation.) Michael Douglas made the DynaTAC famous three years later, when his character, Gordon Gekko, brandished one in Wall Street. In terms of cell phones, we all know what happened in the 90s and early Aughts. These two decades saw incremental but incredible improvements to cellular technology. The phones got smaller, and they got a lot cheaper. The networks got faster, and the service also got a lot cheaper. Whereas cell phone service cost as much as a dollar a minute during the AMPS days, plans with hundreds of minutes were down to $50 or $60 a month by the early Aughts. Plus free nights and weekends! But it was the improved data rates that changed how we used cell phones most profoundly. The original, so-called 1G analogue technology behind AMPS was eventually supplanted by new digital standards that offered more efficient ways of encoding data, greater access to the wireless spectrum and, as a result, faster, more dependable connections. After the second generation of cellular connectivity, 2G, came the big breakthrough: internet anywhere. “With 3G, for the first time, you had a larger bandwidth and reasonable data rates to support meaningful experiences for the user, the idea that internet access would become possible arrived with 3G,” Babek Bahesti, IEEE member and associate dean of School of Engineering and Computing Sciences at New York Institute of Technology, told Gizmodo. Bahesti helped develop 3G technology, which allowed data rates up to 3 megabits-per-second. The next generation would blow that out of the water, he explained, but there were also social consequences. “With 4G, we’re looking at data rates up to 100 mbps, already a 30-fold increase over 3G, and a much more integrated web,” Bahesti explained. “In terms of impact to consumers and to society, we have become much more tethered to our work and the outside world by having constant internet connectivity.” The little handheld gadgets we now just call phones changed the way we communicated. The technology has changed the way we live. But in the midst of it all, more boutique wireless standards like wi-fi as well as the internet of things started to change the way the world works. The wi-fi mutiny By the late 90s, engineers had realized that wireless would transform everything very quickly. The technology wasn’t just about making phone calls from more places. Newly available bands of spectrum were opening up the possibility to send massive quantities of data over the air, and that idea upended the most basic concepts of how we stayed connected. You didn’t need to be tethered to a phone line to connect to the internet. As early as 1988, industry visionaries realized that how an FCC decision made it possible to create a new standard for wireless internet service. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) called this new standard 802.11, and by 1997, the organization had established the basic framework for wireless fidelity, a clunky name that was eventually shorted to wi-fi. This idea turned into a world-changing revolution, and fittingly, Apple was one of this first companies to offer wi-fi connectivity in its computers. (Steve Jobs called the feature “Airport,” for some reason.) The beauty of wi-fi from day one was the fact that operated in the “garbage bands” of the radio spectrum: the 2.4 GHz UHF band and the 5GHz band. This is the same range that microwaves use to heat up food and became widely used for communication after cordless phones started using these bands. Wi-fi gained most of its popularity under the 802.11b standard, which operates on the 2.4GHz band, although the newer 802.11ac standard is more popular now, since it can handle data transfer rates as fast as 1-gigabit per second. But 15 years ago, the concept of internet connectivity over the air at any speed was Earth-shattering. “We stand at the brink of a transformation,” Wired’ s Chris Anderson wrote of wi-fi in 2003. “It is a moment that echoes the birth of the Internet in the mid-‘70s, when the radical pioneers of computer networking—machines talking to each other!—hijacked the telephone system with their first digital hellos.” Anderson was not wrong. Wi-fi was about to upend our very conception of connectivity. This idea that the internet could be everywhere would transform not only communication but also how humans understood the world. The sword-thrusting paragraph of that seminal Wired feature is worth quoting in full: This time it is not wires but the air between them that is being transformed. Over the past three years, a wireless technology has arrived with the power to totally change the game. It’s a way to give the Internet wings without licenses, permission, or even fees. In a world where we’ve been conditioned to wait for cell phone carriers to bring us the future, this anarchy of the airwaves is as liberating as the first PCs—a street-level uprising with the power to change everything. Crazy right? That was less than 15 years ago. Anderson’s predictions were only partially true, though. Little did Wired realize that the internet and the technology that enabled connectivity would later become a battleground for security, free speech, and political responsibility before too long. But the technology, at the time, it was revolutionary. The internet of really cool things While wi-fi was rapidly becoming the standard for wirelessly connecting to the internet, a number of other technologies emerged that offered a different type of communication. Instead of helping humans communicate with each other, this so-called Internet of Things enabled gadgets to talk to each other. The new standards that would govern these connections started appearing in the late 90s, just as wi-fi was gaining mainstream popularity, and widespread adoption since then can only be described as chaotic. The first IoT standard that took off is still the most popular: Bluetooth. Hilariously named after a medieval Scandinavian king who may or may not have had an actual blue tooth in his head, the close-range wireless standard found its origins in an unlikely partnership between Ericsson, Nokia, Intel, IBM and other researchers in 1997. The companies developed a new wireless standard that would let devices connect to each other locally. (Fun fact: Bluetooth was almost called personal-area-networking, or PAN, but that name was ruled out due to poor SEO.) Without the need for internet connectivity, this standard would open up an exiting new arena for wireless accessories—everything from keyboards and headphones to desktops and laptops—and change the way the entire world used gadgets. Bluetooth is now in its fifth generation, and its range has stretched from about 30 feet to as much as 1,000 feet in the latest version. Like wi-fi before it, the technology operates on the 2.4GHz band of spectrum and also sucks up a fair amount of power to do so. This is, in part, what later led to the development of very low power, close range wireless standards like Zigbee and Z-Wave. Both of these protocols emerged in the 2000s and are now widely used for home automation technology like connected lightbulbs, smart locks, and security cameras. As wi-fi hardware becomes more compact and low-energy, however, it’s starting to be used in this space more and more. On top of that, new wireless communication protocols like the one-way radio-frequency identification (RFID) and near-field communications (NFC), which is based on RFID technology but can both send and receive data, hit the market. Unlike wi-fi and Bluetooth, these wireless technologies can operate on a tiny trickle of electricity. NFC is now standard in most new smartphones and enables quick, wireless file transfers between devices. It’s also what powers most modern wireless payment systems. (Fun fact #2: one of the first appearances of NFC technology was in a 1997 Star Wars toy.) RFID, meanwhile, can be used for anything from tracking inventory in retail stores to helping Disney track guests as they wander through its amusement parks. If you’ve read anything about the burgeoning popularity of IoT devices, you’ll know that security is a major concern. Generally speaking, the technology is so new and new devices are so often released into the wild without proper testing that hackers just love to find new ways to take over wireless networks by exploiting a vulnerability in an unsecured device. This is exactly what happened in late 2016, when an IoT exploit succeeded in shutting down half of America’s internet. In the sense that wi-fi was the wild west of wireless 15 years ago, the Internet of Things is a veritable shitshow in the late 2010s. The next big things In more ways than one, this is only the beginning of the wireless takeover. Telegraphy and radio, in many respects, were just the beginning. Wireless technologies have also coopted other methods of transmitting information and even electricity through the air. The use of infrared light in gadgets like remote controls is old hat, but companies like Facebook and SpaceX are currently experimenting with lasers to beam internet access from satellites down to Earth’s surface. This so-called free-space optical communication is still very expensive, but it might supplant electromagnetic waves for wireless communications since it can handle such vast quantities of data. Wireless power, however, is already hitting the mainstream. But the current state of the technology is limited to very close ranges. Right now, the Qi specification governs how hundreds of different devices use electromagnetic induction to charge gadgets like smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S8 ; smartwatches, like the Apple Watch ; and power tools, like Bosch’s professional line-up. In each of these examples, you have to place the device on top of a charging pad to soak up that sweet wireless electricity. But you don’t actually need to plug anything in. The technology will surely scale up in the years to come. Some companies are already getting pretty crazy with wireless power. In South Korea, for example, one city is testing out electric buses that received wireless power from cables laid underneath the road’s surface using using Shaped Magnetic Field in Resonance (SMFIR) technology. So suddenly, finally, we’re finding our way back into that mad scientist territory. Tesla would be thrilled. Who knows when we might build some sort of giant coil that can blast electricity across entire oceans. It might never happen. If you’d asked any pedestrian in the 20th century if we would one day be able to sit in a coffee shop with a pocket computer and talk to anyone in the world, without plugging into anything, they’d call you crazy. If you mentioned that you could charge the phone by placing it on the table, they’d call you crazy. If you suggested that the communications were being sent to space and back down to Earth with lasers, they’d call the police. And yet, here we are.","Halfway between Brooklyn and Montauk, a steel cupola propped up on wooden legs once looked out over the Long Island Sound and beyond the horizon.

Laura Hautala,"Cracking iPhones -- as in accessing their data -- will be harder when Apple rolls out USB Restricted Mode. James Martin/CNET Apple will make a method -- often used by police -- for getting data off iPhones much less powerful with a software update announced Wednesday. The change, called USB Restricted Mode, will close down access to data through a iPhone's Lightning port if the phone hasn't been unlocked in the past hour. The update isn't meant to hold back law enforcement efforts, Apple said Wednesday, but to close a security hole that put customers at risk. Not just police, but identity thieves could use the Lightning port to access data. What's more, Apple reportedly told Reuters, some of its customers live in countries where police take possession of phones whenever they want. ""At Apple, we put the customer at the center of everything we design,"" the Apple said in an emailed statement. ""We're constantly strengthening the security protections in every Apple product to help customers defend against hackers, identity thieves and intrusions into their personal data. We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don't design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs."" The announcement is one more piece of Apple's effort to position itself as a champion of user privacy, an approach that has put it at odds with law enforcement in the US. In 2016, the company refused a demand from the FBI that it create software to circumvent encryption technology on an iPhone that had belonged to a suspect in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. That stand-off ended when the Department of Justice said it had found a third party that could unlock the iPhone without Apple's help. The FBI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple pointed out Wednesday that it has responded to thousands of requests from US law enforcement for access to customer data -- more than 14,000 in 2017. Currently, law enforcement and others can plug specialized tools made by cybersecurity experts into the phone's Lightning port to access data. Apple hinted at the change in early versions of its iPhone software, iOS. Software developers noticed it in the beta version iOS 11.3 before it disappeared from the publicly released version of the software. Then it was named again in release notes for the beta version of iOS 11.4. Apple didn't say which future version of iOS would contain the update.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Our benign version of Skynet is about to be one step closer to completion. A new weather satellite is set to launch next Thursday courtesy of NASA and a Atlas V rocket. It will provide some of the most detailed imagery of the western U.S. as well as Alaska, Hawaii, and the Pacific region ever captured from space. The satellite, dubbed GOES-S, will be the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) latest next generation weather satellite to keep an eye on the atmosphere. For meteorologists, it’s a huge asset to improve forecasting and a real opportunity to save lives. For the average person, it’s a chance to marvel at the beauty of our planet from 22,000 miles above the surface. “The eye candy is awesome but the science is why so much money is put into these projects.” Let’s talk about what the nerds get first. James Yoe, the chief administrator of the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation, told Earther the satellite is a “three-four-five” kind of benefit because its instruments capture three times as many spectral channels at four times the resolution five times as fast as GOES West, the satellite it’s slated to replace. Its cousin satellite, GOES-16, is already in space keeping an eye on the Americas and the Atlantic Ocean, and has the same capabilities as GOES-S so scientists know what they’re getting. “It’s like looking at an old grainy black and white photo vs. a digital camera snapping pictures in multiple colors in real time,” Yoe said. “That detail is not juts a ‘gee, wow neat’ factor. That enables us to identify features in meteorology that can make forecasts that affect business and citizens.” So what’s in the box? The satellite’s sensors capture 16 bands of imagery (as opposed to GOES West’s five). That allows scientists to get a better view of atmospheric phenomena like snow, fog, clouds, and volcanic ash, as well as vegetation on the ground. It also has sensors that can map lightning and return data on solar flares and space particles. It’s able to return views to every five minutes, but it also has the ability to rapidly scan up to two smaller areas at the same time every 30 seconds. “If you’re looking at severe weather event, you can get updates as those storms are evolving or decaying almost as fast as it’s happening,” Yoe said. “You can give warning faster than you’ve ever previously been able to.” Forecasters have already been able to do that with GOES-16, which was put in orbit early last year and has the same equipment as GOES-S. It had a prime time view for the destructive Atlantic hurricane season that wreaked havoc from Texas to Puerto Rico. That included Hurricane Harvey’s eye. Using the near-real time imagery, Yoe said NOAA was able to tell emergency managers in Corpus Christi—which bore the brunt of Harvey’s winds before the storm transitioned to an historic rainmaker —almost exactly when the worst of the storm was about to roar ashore to provide pinpoint warnings. GOES-S will be able to provide hurricane insights over Hawaii and powerful Gulf of Alaska storms, both areas not covered by GOES-16. It will also provide better coverage of the West Coast where its lightning mapper will come in really handy. The mountains that slice up the West from California to Colorado can obscure radar station’s view of storms. With a high-level view from GOES-S, scientists will be able to detect lightning and in turn can warn forest managers where to look for lightning-sparked wildfires. That could cut down on response time and improve forest management. It would also be a boon to river forecast managers looking to provide earlier, more accurate warnings on flash floods. “The improvement of weather models and forecasts is the reason these satellites are up there,” Dakota Smith, a meteorologist and Twitter’s resident GOES-16 afficinado and visiting scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told Earther. “The eye candy is awesome but the science is why so much money is put into these projects. We haven’t even scratched the surface when it comes to the science these satellites will help us accomplish.” Yeah, but about that eye candy. There’s a lot of it when it comes to the GOES series of satellites. Smith is perhaps one of the biggest purveyors of it. He’s even inspired a weird Twitter account that ranks what he finds a la @dog_rates. “We’re seeing our atmosphere in a way that we’ve never seen before,” Smith said, describing why he thinks GOES-16 imagery gets the people going. “It’s a new frontier and that excites people.” While GOES-S won’t necessarily improve our views of hurricanes, it will provide a clearer picture of amazing West Coast happenings. Smith cited this recent von Karman vortex sighting as a good example of imagery that would be improved with a more West Coast-centric satellite: There are still two more GOES satellites on the docket after GOES-S as part of an $11-billion satellite upgrade. The recent Trump budget includes a $335 million planned cut in funding for the program. “I like being able to measure winds in Pacific and to put them in long-term weather models to give us guidance 3-7 days ahead,” Yoe said about one of his favorite GOES-S meteorology advances. “What moves me as a human being, being able to see this whole range of weather and environmental phenomena that impacts people’s lives, property, plans, and economic opportunities. I get really excited about that.”","Our benign version of Skynet is about to be one step closer to completion.

SARAH VOWELL,"Bozeman, Mont. — Here in the Mountain West, there are no longer four seasons, only two: winter and wildfire. (Unless you’re a tourist, in which case: ski season and fly fishing.) Come August, my sister and I will make our annual bet, for pizza, on what date the first snow will fall in Bozeman, our hometown. I always lose rooting for the earliest possible flurries, since the snows snuff out the region’s last, stubborn wildfires. Then, when the smoke finally stops wafting across the Gallatin Valley, I can put away my eyedrops and see clearly which neighbors fail to abide by the Northern Hemisphere’s most sacred social contract, shoveling one’s sidewalk. Who cares about Republicans and Democrats? In this climate, there are only snow-shoveling solid citizens or the deadbeats whose slippery walks pose a daily existential threat to the brittle bones of my nice, elderly mom. Looking back on this neck of the woods’ multiplying struggles with the effects of global warming — and drying — I have come to think of June 14, 1988, as the first day of the rest of our lives. On that date 30 years ago, lightning struck the Custer National Forest northeast of Yellowstone National Park, igniting the Storm Creek fire, the first of that hot, dry, windy summer’s major infernos to spread into the park. By mid-July, lightning had also sparked the Shoshone, Fan, Red, Clover and Mink fires. On Aug. 20, fireballs conveyed by 80-mile-per-hour winds ravaged 165,000 acres in a single day remembered as Black Saturday. On Sept. 1, a headline in this newspaper announced, “ U.S. Forest Fires Worst Since 1919.” By Sept. 11, when the first snows started to put an end to the ordeal, 1.4 million acres of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem had burned, including more than a third of America’s oldest and most beloved national park.","It’s almost like we have just two seasons now, winter and wildfire.",2018-06-13T23:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Contributing Op-Ed Writer: Shouting ‘Fire!’ in the Burning West,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/opinion/wildfire-west-yellowstone.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/14/opinion/14Vowell/14Vowell-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lightning,1
Daniel Kolitz,"Animals fatally maul, sting, trample, and chew about a million humans per year. Pretty nice of them, given the numbers on our side—the average of 750 million chickens we kill in the U.S. every month, for instance. In an ideal world, no one would ever get mauled by a bear, or contract rabies from a feral squirrel. But for this week’s Giz Asks, we’re asking which creatures are most desperate for our blood (or, in fairness to the animal kingdom, which are most likely to kill us by accident). We reached out to a number of animal experts to figure out exactly that: which non-parasitic, non-microbial animals kill the most humans, as well as which ones are the most potentially dangerous. Mosquitos, it turns out, don’t just ruin summers—they also kill upwards of a quarter of a million people every single year. But as we learned from our experts, they’re the outlier: Animal-on-human homicide seems to be relatively rare, at least compared to the human-on-human kind, which—as nearly all our experts pointed out—exceeds it by many magnitudes (not counting mosquitoes). That said, there are plenty of animals with blood on their paws, or their scales, or—who knew!—their hooves. Dave Barash Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Washington, animal behavior researcher, and the co-author of The Mammal in the Mirror: Understanding Our Place in the Animal World and many other books One of the most lethal critters in both North and South America, according to your criteria, are cows, hands down. Forget about snakes, cougars, bears, etc. Cows are large, strong and not always amenable to whatever farmers or ranchers want to do with them. They look pacific and mostly are, but they’re one of the main sources of animal-human mortality, mostly by goring their victims (not bulls, but cows, since there are so many more of them) and sometimes kicking or trampling. Sharks and venomous snakes kill about 1 American per year, cows more than 20. Bees, however, are likely in second place, via anaphylactic shock among susceptible people. In Africa, it’s—believe it or not—hippos, which seem downright adorable but are pretty nasty and somewhat larger than poodles, and at night in particular emerge from their puddles. In Australia, it’s kangaroos—because of the auto crashes they generate. Throughout the world, however, there’s no question that the species Homo sapiens is the most lethal and dangerous, and without doubt the only one that threatens the whole fucking planet... even discounting nuclear weapons (which no one should!). Rory Wilson Professor of Aquatic Biology at Swansea University The answer might be somewhere in the category of ‘venomous snakes’, or even a specific venomous snake, such as the Many-banded krait, because figures suggest that about 320 people in Myanmar will die of snake bite today. But as anti-venom becomes more prevalent, that is expected to decrease. This latter point exemplifies the difficulty of defining ‘most dangerous’ for a ‘moving target’. As human populations change, and move in and out of cities, then proportions of populations expose themselves to different risks, and the answer will change. And as man engages in environmental change (cutting down rainforests, for example), then suites of ‘dangerous’ animals change in their abundance. We have successfully reduced the number of top predators on the planet spectacularly so that, for example, the Oceanic white-tipped shark, the fish that was to supposed to have killed (and eaten) the most sailors during World War II, is now down to 1% of its former levels. Try floating around in the Indian Ocean now. You’re unlikely to be found by an Oceanic white-tip. And then there’s the issue of behavior. How we behave, even in an environment with ‘dangerous animals’, will affect our chances of detriment. It is said that we are more likely to be struck by lightning than be attacked by a shark. But you won’t be struck by lightning if you live close to the South Pole, where there are virtually no lightning storms. Conversely, if you scuba dive around Seal Island in False Bay, South Africa, with speared fish on your belt, your appeal to white sharks will go up enormously—like standing on top of a hill in a lightning storm hugging a lightning conductor. The shark/lightning example is perhaps overkill though, because fish blood from spearfishing victims appeals to behavioural elements of the shark itself. If you want to make the animal death option analogy more simply probabilistic, like lightning, or being hit on the head by a coconut or a falling tree, try swimming in waters with box jellyfish. They are reputed to kill 30 people per year in the Philippines alone (even accounting for the fact that people tend to avoid box jellyfish waters), and box jellyfish are definitely not out to kill people. But what about the probability of death given that some person has actually ‘stumbled upon’ the animal in question—the ‘oops, I’ve come within 5 m of a hippo/buffalo/lion effect’? I wish it was that easy. The distance plays a role. So to answer that question we need to specify the distance. Being five metres from a stonefish is a banality (treading on one—where distance = 0 m —is not) but it’s a fabulously trivial distance to be from a black rhino. Brian Todd Associate Professor, Wildlife, Fish &amp; Conservation Biology and head of Todd Lab at UC Davis The most dangerous animal of course is the mosquito. But this is because it transmits the malaria parasite that kills millions annually. But my expertise is working with reptiles and amphibians, so the dangerous animals that come to mind are venomous snakes. We gotta be careful not to demonize snakes. They’re not really out there chasing people down. The conflict comes from the fact that many people in developing countries work and live very closely with the environment around them. In rice fields, and in a lot of agricultural areas, people just come into contact with these very venomous, high deadly snakes—and if the snakes get stepped on, their reaction is to bite. The deaths occur for a couple of reasons. The first is that the snakes tend to be quite dangerous in many of those parts of the world. The second is that it’s just really difficult to get access to healthcare to be treated for snake bites. In places like Europe, Australia or North America we have ready access to a lot of good health care and treatments to prevent anyone from dying. Australia in fact has some of the most venomous snakes in the world but they only have a handful of people a year dying. It’s mostly in these rural, relatively impoverished areas like South Asia, India and Central Africa where people are at high risk of coming into contact with venomous snakes Some of the estimates I’ve seen in places like India and Bangladesh show as many as 30 to 40 thousand people a year being killed by snakes. In the US, on the other hand, the estimates I’ve seen are that there are about 10 people a year who get killed by venomous snakes—but in some years it’s as few as none, or just one or two people. The problem in the US is that something like 2/3 of people bitten by snakes in North America are men between the ages of 18 to 35, and about half of these cases involve alcohol. And the most common places people are bitten is on their hands or their feet, and it’s usually because either they stepped on a snake by accident, or in the case of a hand, because they were messing with it. There’s a joke in emergency rooms that the last thing someone says before they get bit by a snake is “hold my beer.” The problem is testosterone poisoning more than anything. Madhusudan Katti Associate Professor in the Forestry &amp; Environment Resources Department at NC State University whose research includes “the evolutionary ecology of vertebrate responses to human modification of habitats, and on the dynamics of coupled natural and human systems” The first species that came to mind may not be surprising: humans. I don’t know that any other species has killed as many humans as we have. If you just look at our history of conflict and warfare and violence, it probably adds up to more than any other single species or group of species might have inflicted. The thing that also strikes me as being unusual is that we’re the only species that inflicts so much violence and kill so many of our own in this way. There are other examples of intra-species violence—one example that comes to mind is species like spiders, where the females will eat the males after mating. But it’s selected in some ways for benefits—a male spider eaten by a female spider might contribute necessary nutrition. People have made adaptive arguments for human violence, but our species has come up with mechanisms of mass violence on a scale no other species has. As for non-human animals—I grew up in India, which still has a largely agrarian landscape, but there’s s a significant death toll from snakes, especially venomous snakes. In india we talk about the “big four” snakes, which continue to exact a significant toll every year—they kill more people than tigers and leopards and other animals that get more attention. Growing up in India, I was on the alert about snakes everywhere, rather than worrying about the big, charismatic carnivores. James Sulikowski Professor of Marine Science and head of Sulikowski Shark and Fish Research Lab at the University of New England Sharks in no way pose an active threat of any kind to humans. In fact we humans face more direct threats from vending machines and toilet seats. Most interactions with sharks occur because the shark is curious or investigating potential food. This can lead to an accidental bite. But in most cases, the shark realizes the mistake and just swims off. Unfortunately, this often leaves the human with a some type of bite mark, and many end up with scars. But I think the big picture is that about 100 people worldwide are bitten by sharks [each year]—of those, maybe 10 are fatal. So humans’ irrational fear of sharks is really emotionally not statistically driven. Do you have a burning question for Giz Asks?

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Your humble Earther weather correspondent went the roof of Gizmodo Media’s offices to capture the above picture. By the time he descended to the ground floor, all hell had broken loose. Powerful winds made umbrellas abstract sculptures of plastic, metal, and fabric. And that’s too bad for their owners, as torrential rains turned city streets into rivers as lightning forked across the sky and the National Weather Service New York office urged residents to “SEEK SHELTER NOW inside a sturdy structure and stay away from windows.” Which is why I am holed up in our offices (far from windows of course!) writing this blog instead of heading home. So, what the hell happened on a day that started sunny and stayed that way until 15 minutes before the gates of hell appeared over Midtown? If you’re a Twitter user, you’ve probably seen the term derecho thrown around today, as well as on Monday when the Washington, D.C. region was buffeted by powerful storms and the president drove through an area under a freaking tornado warning (pro tip: do not do this even if you’re leader of the free world). A derecho is basically a powerful windstorm that moves in a straight line unlike tornadoes, which spin in a tight area, or hurricanes, which spin over a much larger area. Making things even more confusing: some derechos can come with tornadoes. So, was this a derecho? Well, it’s complicated. The pattern of wild weather began this morning. Those same sunny skies helped heat the land up, while winds from the south drew even more hot, humid air into the region. Temperatures peaked in the upper 80s in New York and 90s further south. A cap of stable air in the atmosphere allowed all that heat to build up, a setup that Capital Weather Gang wrote this morning would help “rapidly destabilize the atmosphere this afternoon.” We saw that start in central Pennsylvania, where the powerful series of thunderstorms built into the afternoon before lumbering toward the I-95 corridor. Along the way, they dropped hail the size of baseballs and left a wake of lightning that looks like an open wound across Pennsylvania. The storms then plowed into New York right at rush hour. I didn’t have an anemometer on the roof of Gizmodo Media HQ, but I feel safe saying it was windy as fuck. Video showed gusts swirling water out of a rooftop pool. And wind gusts have already hit 40 mph in Massachusetts, which is next in line to get hammered. Forecasts indicate winds could top out at 70 mph in some locations. So yes, storm bad. But derecho bad? According to the Storm Prediction Center, “by the present definition, derecho winds must meet the National Weather Service criterion for severe wind gusts (greater than 57 mph) at most points along the storm path.” They also have to widespread. So far, at least, this storm hasn’t met the official derecho criteria. But you should still exercise extreme caution, avoid driving on flooded roadways, and stay away from rooftops and other areas that could expose you to lightning.","Your humble Earther weather correspondent went the roof of Gizmodo Media’s offices to capture the above picture.

MIKE HALE,"It doesnt seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing The Umbrella Academy on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing Doom Patrol, while you note that the Doom Patrol comic books were a primary model, along with X-Men, for the Umbrella Academy comics.
Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like Legends of Tomorrow, Titans and Black Lightning and Marvel shows like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Runaways, The Gifted and Legion, to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBOs Watchmen adaptation and Netflixs Jupiters Legacy.
So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values (Black Lightning on CW) or go all in on replicating the comic book experience (Legion on FX). Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness theyre action thrillers in which the action feels forced and theyre family dramas in which we dont really care about the family.
Which brings us to The Umbrella Academy, based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like Doom Patrol, which Way has generously cited as an influence, its about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure.","“The Umbrella Academy,” on Netflix, and “Doom Patrol,” on DC Universe, take different approaches to a pair of closely linked comic books about misfit superheroes.",2019-02-14T20:13:17Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",‘The Umbrella Academy’ and ‘Doom Patrol’ Feature Strangely Similar Super-Teams,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/arts/television/umbrella-academy-doom-patrol-review.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/15/arts/15doom-umbrella/15doom-umbrella-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lightning,1
Tim Hardwick,"Mobile accessory maker Anker has opened pre-orders for the first Apple-certified USB-C to Lightning cable under the Made for iPhone (MFi) program, and will start shipping the cables later this month.
Apple late last year began allowing third-party companies to produce MFi certified USB-C to Lightning cables, and as a result, multiple companies have announced the upcoming launch of new USB-C to Lightning cable options. 
However, as noted by The Verge, it looks like Anker will be the first to make the accessory available, thanks to its PowerLine II USB-C Cable with Lightning Cable. 
The cables will be available in both three and six-foot lengths and in different colors, but pre-orders are currently only for the three-foot White PowerLine II, which costs $15.99. An equivalent one-meter (or three-and-a-quarter foot) USB-C to Lightning cable from Apple costs $19.
All cables support Anker's Power Delivery system (using its separately available USB-C Wall Adaptor), have a 12,000 bend lifespan, and come with a lifetime warranty. The company originally planned to launch the cables in March 2019, but initial pre-orders will now ship around February 20.","Mobile accessory maker Anker has opened pre-orders for the first Apple-certified USB-C to Lightning cable under the Made for iPhone (MFi) program, and will start shipping the cables later this month.

Dami Lee,"Some new iPhone XS and XS Max buyers have reported poor cellular reception with Apple’s latest phones, and now there’s another issue that might result in you waking up with an uncharged device in the morning. Dozens of users have reported charging issues with their iPhone XS and XS Max devices, and shared their experiences on the MacRumors forums and Apple’s support forums. Specifically, users are experiencing issues where phones will not charge if the Lightning cable is plugged in while the device is asleep. The problem appears to be a software bug — perhaps related to the phone’s USB accessory settings — and requires iPhones to be unlocked (or at least have the screen lit up) in order to begin charging. Tech vlogger Lewis Hilsenteger demonstrated the issues on nine different iPhone X, XS, and XS Max devices on his YouTube channel Unbox Therapy. Some iPhones respond immediately to being plugged into a charger, while others have to be tapped to awaken, and others freeze up. Users experiencing the issues have come up with workarounds, including upgrading to iOS 12.1 beta, which apparently eliminates the problem entirely. So whenever Apple releases that to everyone, it shouldn’t be an issue anymore. For now, others suggest going into Settings, FaceID and Passcode, scrolling down to “Allow access when locked” and turning on USB Accessories. Apple has yet to respond to the poor cell reception issue, but we’ve also reached out for a comment on the charging issues, and will update when we hear back.","Several owners of iPhone XS and XS Max devices have reported issues with charging their phones.

Chaim Gartenberg,"We all knew this day would come eventually, but apparently 2018 is the year: Apple will reportedly no longer bundle its 3.5mm to Lightning port headphone dongle with this year’s iPhone models, according to a research note from Barclays that was seen by MacRumors. And while you can take Barclays’ note with a grain of salt, the sourcing does seem at least somewhat legitimate. The research note claims that Cirrus Logic, a supplier for the dongle has “confirmed” that it won’t be included in the box alongside the new iPhones. The wireless era could be fast approaching Apple has been trying to transition away from wired headphones entirely with its AirPods and lineup of wireless Beats headphones, so the move isn’t entirely surprising. The dongle was always meant as a stopgap while customers adjusted to the new, headphone jack-less reality that Apple imposed on the world. Apple will almost certainly continue to sell the dongle — which costs $9 — separately for users who still want it. But if the report is true (which, again, remains to be seen), it’s hard to imagine that customers will take the news well. And considering the already low price of the dongle, one has to wonder: is this really worth the savings?","Apple may no longer be including its iPhone headphone jack dongles in the box with this year’s 2018 models, according to a research note from Barclays citing reports from suppliers",2018-08-03T15:16:38Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Apple’s 2018 iPhones are rumored to not include headphone dongle in the box,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/3/17647840/apple-2018-iphones-headphone-dongle-in-box-rumor-barclays-research,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k0yEdaaa8YzNdzTBluoE-jZSuUY=/0x159:1400x892/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7723563/headphone_dongle.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,lightning,1
Jon Evans,"It was, briefly, the zeitgeist’s perfect Silicon Valley story: a sex-and-drugs party hosted hosted by since-ousted top-tier VC Steve Jurvetson, at an official Draper Fisher Jurvetson event,attended by multiple billionaires including Elon Musk. So said Paul Biggar, founder of CircleCI, in a widely read Medium post, expanding on Vanity Fair’s excerpt of Emily Chang’s new book. (To be clear, it was Axios who subsequently named Jurvetson and DFJ.) Is that actually what happened? Did a major Valley VC firm host a decadent sex-and-MDMA party as part of one of its official events smack in the midst of last year’s widespread sexual-harassment revelations? Uhhhhhh. Well. As it turns out, not so much. Biggar notes that he didn’t actually see anything outrageous or salacious happening by the time he left, and, it seems others have vouched that, afterwards … such things continued to not happen: I want to share some longer remarks on the so-called Silicon Valley elite “sex party” that’s making the rounds. (Be warned: the truth is boring.) pic.twitter.com/T4BrLTeFof — Mason Hartman (@webdevMason) January 12, 2018 In fairness to Chang, she was writing about secret Valley sex parties in general, mentioned in passing that “while some parties may be devoted primarily to drugs and sexual activity, others may boast just pockets of it,” and cited this particular event — and a woman there being given drugs by one man, and then hit on by another in an inappropriate and exploitative way — as an example. So what happened at that party? It sounds like the answer is “at least two instances of shitty behavior which are basically, infuriatingly, pretty typical examples of how the tech industry treats women.” But it also sounds like it was basically a fairly tame, if themed and Burning-Man-ish, event which some culturally conservative people saw and immediately misinterpreted as a sex party. Which is exactly why I call it the perfect Silicon Valley story: everyone is looking for lightning-rod reasons to hate the Valley right now. The sex-party narrative is like a Rorschach excuse. Right-wingers can condemn it as an example of tech’s corrupt, decadent liberalism. Leftists can excoriate it as an instance of tech’s bone-deep sexism and exploitative hegemony of privileged white men. This is just one especially vivid example. Slings and arrows from across the political spectrum are being aimed at tech. Liberals point out that it has treated women abominably for decades, while Asians face a “bamboo ceiling” and other nonwhite people are all but excluded; they blame Facebook for the election, Twitter for allowing Donald Trump and neo-nazis to run rampant, Amazon and Google for avoiding taxes, etc. Conservatives, meanwhile, accuse tech of a lack of “ viewpoint diversity ” — which bespeaks a bizarre miscomprehension that their belief systems are rejected purely because they’re different, when in fact they are rejected because climate-change denialism, and denying the systemic oppression of people who weren’t born white men, are as demonstrably &amp; morally incorrect as e.g. flat-eartherism and eugenics, and treated accordingly. Slightly more plausibly, they accuse Facebook of censoring conservative news, while targeting Twitter for shadow-banning right-wingers. While the ""shithole"" story continues to dominate on mainstream outlets, over in the RW media universe, Breitbart still giving all its attention to allegations Twitter is biased against conservatives… pic.twitter.com/mpgJO0ceke — Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) January 12, 2018 But wait, there’s more! As the rent crisis wracks America, its victims, desperate for affordable housing in desirable places, hate the tech industry for gentrifying the cities — San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, NYC, Boston, etc — where people most want to live. Meanwhile, as the media hemorrhages money, it becomes ever more reliant on Facebook and Google — even as that duopoly devours most of the advertising dollars that used to go to the media. And as both media and finance go tech, East Coasters (and Londoners) see that their center-of-the-universe influence, which they once thought unassailable, has moved to California and beyond. Is it really that surprising, when you follow the money, that the American media’s love affair with the tech industry is coming to a bitter and increasingly furious end? The reason why is obvious. We have the money, now. Seven of the ten largest publicly traded companies in the world are tech companies, and three of them are headquartered within cycling distance of one another in Silicon Valley, surrounded by a nimbus of dozens of unicorns. With that wealth comes huge (at least perceived) power — not just financial, but the power to shape the future, to influence the masses, to shape mass political movements. Do you see a lot of popular narratives whose heroes are privileged, unelected engineers and investors whose previously sizable wealth has grown into immense riches and enormous power? Uh, no. In fact you may have noticed that, in virtually every popular story, such people are the bad guys. There’s a reason for that: historically, power corrupts. People everywhere are already eager for lightning-rod trumped-up reasons to hate the Valley and the tech industry as a whole. And it’s not like we haven’t given them at least a few real ones. So it might be time to start thinking less about money and power, and more about values, and how we might actually make sacrifices in service of those values — because history indicates that blatant, widespread hypocrisy is one of several effective ways to transform a lightning rod into an angry mob wielding pitchforks and torches.","It was, briefly, the zeitgeist’s perfect Silicon Valley story: a sex-and-drugs party hosted hosted by since-ousted top-tier VC Steve Jurvetson, at an official Draper Fisher Jurvetson event,attended by multiple billionaires including Elon Musk.

To me, my Spoilers! Deadpool 2 A new report from The Hollywood Reporter about the film’s reshoots and recent test screenings also includes an intriguing claim that at least one additional reshoot involved several hours in Los Angeles to add a “secret cameo” to the film. Time to start speculating wildly in the comments! Speaking of reshoots, the Negasonic Teenage Warhead herself Brianna Hildebrand spoke to Screen Geek about them and the misconception that’s developed around reshoots in general recently: It was nothing that had gone wrong. I think it’s a common misconception too – that people think that reshoots are to fix things that people didn’t like. A lot of the time, reshoots are to add more of the things that people loved. [Filmmakers] watch their films again and are like “better fix that”. I don’t know how much I can say about that. Usually films hate it when you talk about their reshoots – solely because people think that it’s because the film was bad for the test audience – but it was all good. The Predator In a Facebook post, Fred Dekker confirmed he’s currently in Vancouver filming reshoots on The Predator. Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp In the latest issue of Empire magazine, director Peyton Reed stated Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp is “not a romantic comedy,” as previously advertised. It was important to me, in this movie called Ant-Man and The Wasp, that she’s not a supporting character. She’s a lead character. She really was, along with Sue Storm of the Fantastic Four, one of the first female Marvel heroes. I feel a certain responsibility with The Wasp. This one explores the different generations of Ant-Man and The Wasp. I thought that was an interesting thing we haven’t seen in a Marvel movie. It’s not a romantic comedy.

I’m like sold. If the whole third movie was that scene, we’re fine. A Series of Unfortunate Events Allison Williams has joined the cast in a currently undisclosed role. Preacher Adam Croasdell and Prema Cruz have joined the recurring cast of season three. Croasdell will play Eccarius, “a 350-year-old vampire who bears wisdom and has an air of aristocracy. He is regal, charming, and styles himself after the more romantic, Gothic images of vampires. He appears to be a cliché at first but a much darker character lurks beneath the surface.” Meanwhile, Cruz has been cast as Madame Boyd, “a tough forward thinker.

Gretchen Giles,"Amazon works in many magical ways, most of them seemingly confined to a shrouded metaphoric cave of wonders. And so it is with its weirdly semi-secret holiday weekend trove of Lightning Deals. We know the days that several of our best-loved books will be on massive discount this Saturday-Sunday, Nov. 25-26, as part of their Lightning Deals initiative. We just don’t know what time. Here’s a rundown of titles and the days on which they’ll be promoted. Divining the specific four-hour Window of Deep Discount is up to you to figure out! When Make : contributor David Lang lost his desk job, he realized that he actually didn’t know how to do anything with his hands except type. He set out to rectify that situation, using his newfound unemployed free time to dive headfirst into the opportunities and challenges of the maker movement. Not only did he learn to solder and prototype, work with PLA and use a breadboard, he co-founded a company and became a passionate advocate for citizen science. This second edition of David’s autobiographical journey was just released, updated to reflect the changing nature of the maker movement and the new opportunities it affords. Dr. AnnMarie Thomas poses the question: What makes a maker? and sets out to answer it through a number of fascinating interviews with famous creatives who have been lucky enough to spend their adulthood messing around and tinkering in the name of scientific inquiry. Turns out that the answer to Dr. Thomas’ question is easy: childhood. The type of upbringing you’re allowed to have helps to shape the inquisitive arc that distinguishes inventors, tinkerers, visionaries, and makers. Most of the professionals introduced in Thomas’ book were allowed to set things on fire, open them up, take them apart, and just generally indulge their emerging intellect when they were probably too young to use matches and saws, or hammers and pliers. Perhaps your own children should be encouraged to do the same. Named for the Italian bar in which it was invented, the Arduino is different because it was created by artists to add kinesis to sculpture and then adapted by techies — not the other way around. Written by Arduino project co-founders Massimo Banzi and Michael Shiloh, this is the seminal starting book for learning to use this immensely popular and insanely inexpensive microcontroller. This third edition includes all the new stuff you need to know to get up and running soon, and start exploring and measuring the world. Plus, of course, making sculpture move. When Randall E. Barrett first published this book in the 1960s, it was possible to visit the corner chemist for a phial of sodium bicarbonate and you probably could put water in a light bulb as he suggests. Not so much any more. But that’s OK, because Evil Mad Scientist co-founder Windell Oskay has rescued Barrett’s wonderfully provocative book from obscurity and updated it for the 21st century. Oskay used Barrett’s original text when he was young, building over 200 projects to compile his own at-home science lab. What did he learn along the way? Pretty much everything. Yes, you could purchase all of the components ready-made but your young maker will miss out on the fun and learning involved in creating them themselves. With literally hundreds of thought-provoking open-ended questions that need solving, this is the ultimate Science Fair primer. Begin by making a battery from a penny and continue on from there, learning complex concepts in a simple way that guarantees success from the start. Fully illustrated and presented with a fun comic, this book marked a different publishing path for us, and one we’re glad we took. This is a terrific book to get interested youngsters, ages 8 and up, hooked on the pleasures of discovery. You’ll probably discover a thing or two, yourself! This is the first in Kathy Ceceri’s “Inventions” series in which she takes such ordinary items as paper and teaches us how to make such non-ordinary things as robots. A best-seller, Paper Inventions has a great wow effect as readers learn how strong paper can be, how delicate it is, and how many ways it can be used, from wearable clothing to scaleable structures. Kathy narrates a fascinating backgrounder on this ancient material, making this a great book to both read and make from. We kind of sensed we were onto something when Tom Igoe, an Arduino co-founder and ITP professor, pronounced this book “an excellent introduction to microcontroller electronics,” adding: “This book is great.” Fully illustrated and dead simple, this book is written so that someone with absolutely no background in electronics, let alone microcontrollers, can understand what the fuss is all about. Step-by-step instructions take readers through increasingly sophisticated projects that build conceptually upon each other without the reader even noticing (don’t tell the kids). Brand new and highly recommended! Written by Casey Reas, the artist and designer who invented the processing language, this short book gently introduces the core concepts around working with this interactive graphical interface. If you’re an artist looking to develop interactive graphics programs or a programmer who wants to become an artist, this book will take you where you want to go. It’s been a best-seller since it was published, and the Google alert I have set for Casey that goes off pretty much every week explains why.","Several incredible maker related books will be on massive discount November 25-26, as part of Amazon's Lightning Deals initiative.

Andrew Liszewski,"Every kid knows the best way to get almost every item on your Christmas list is to include one outlandish, obscenely-expensive item your parents will never go for. Out of guilt, they’ll happily deliver everything else on your list. But you’re an adult now, with a job and disposable income, so why not finally treat yourself to those top-tier items your parents would have scoffed at? Maybe you’ve been fiscally responsible all year, or maybe you’ve got a holiday bonus enroute. It doesn’t matter how you justify the frivolous spending, here are nine extravagant gifts the ten-year-old version of you would have never found under the tree, but the 30-year-old version might. Lego 7,541-Piece Ultimate Collector’s Millennium Falcon Back in 2007, Lego released a 5,195-piece version of the Millennium Falcon that was the toymaker’s largest set to date. But with countless new Star Wars films enroute, Lego has finally upgraded that Millennium Falcon set with an additional 2,346 pieces, adding a tremendous amount of detail—and size—to Han Solo’s ride. The new version includes ten minifigures based on characters from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, the option to install the classic round or modern rectangular sensor dish, and, most importantly, tiny Lego Porgs! Lego: Ultimate Collector’s Millennium Falcon, $800 Winning Solutions Monopoly Transformers Deluxe Collector’s Edition The classic, basic version of Monopoly will set you back just $20 at any toy store on the planet. But who wants to be basic? Winning Solutions, known for its opulent board game upgrades, has created a new version of Monopoly that will appeal to children of the ‘80s. Inspired by the original animated series, the game swaps luxury properties for Transformers characters, hotels and houses for energon cubes, and includes upgraded currency featuring Autobot and Decepticon logos. The board itself even transforms, closing up to store all of the game pieces inside—even the tiny Grimlock. Winning Solutions: Monopoly Transformers Deluxe Collector’s Edition, $300 Analogue Nt mini NES Clone Lots of kids found the original Nintendo Entertainment System under the tree on Christmas morning back in 1983. But fast-forward 34 years and you need a better way to enjoy your favorite 8-bit games on a modern, hi-def TV. Why settle for the limited selection of titles on Nintendo’s NES Classic Edition when you can dust off your original cartridges (Famicom too!) and play them in Analogue’s gorgeous, all-aluminum Nt mini. It’s engineered to perfectly play every last NES game on a big screen, and it even supports modern wireless controllers because tripping over cables was always the worst thing about classic gaming. Analogue: Nt mini Classic, $449 Sphero Ultimate Lightning McQueen Remote control cars are a longtime staple of Christmas mornings, but simply driving in circles around the living room got boring about 20 years ago. Sphero’s Ultimate Lightning McQueen can still do donuts around the tree, but the company used its robotics expertise to make this toy move and behave as close to the original Pixar character as possible. Independently-controlled shocks let Lightning lean into corners and wiggle his body, while a custom-shaped LCD display brings his windshield eyes to life. It’s controlled using a free app on your mobile device, and even includes a bunch of Lightning McQueen’s signature sayings, delivered through an animated mouth on the front bumper. Sphero: Ultimate Lightning McQueen, $300 Razor Crazy Cart XL Watching professional drifters like Ken Block slide their way around an obstacle course might tempt you to reach for the emergency brake on your own car. But minivans are terrible at drifting, and you’ve probably got a few kids in the back who easily get motion sickness. A better way to scratch your drifting itch is with Razor’s Crazy Cart XL which is specifically designed for adult-sized riders. Using a single wheel for both steering and acceleration, the Crazy Cart XL can slide around corners thanks to a set of casters underneath that are free to spin when you yank on a special lever. But with a top speed of 17 miles per hour, there’s little to no risk of injuring yourself, or your new toy. Razor: Crazy Cart XL, $547 Hot Toys Sixth-Scale Iron Man Hulkbuster Armor Calling Hot Toys’ sixth-scale, 21-inch tall Iron Man Hulkbuster replica just an ‘action figure’ would be an insult to the incredible amount of detail packed into this collectible. It’s got over 30 points of articulation, 16 different LED-powered light-up features (including an arc reactor), swappable battle-damaged armor plates, and a retractable helmet that reveals a smaller Iron Man Mark XLIII inside. It deserves to be sold as a work of art rather than just a toy, but even with an obscene price tag, few Iron Man fans will be able to resist actually playing with this one. Sideshow Collectibles: Hot Toys Sixth-Scale Iron Man Hulkbuster, $825 Baller Yoga Football Leather Yoga Mats Aside from new cars and babies, nothing smells quite as satisfying as fresh leather. So the next time you’re downward dogging, instead of breathing in the questionable fumes coming off a foam yoga mat, upgrade to one of Baller Yoga’s alternatives made from the same cowhide used in official NFL footballs. The mats even feature the same iconic white stitching as the pigskins tossed around during the Super Bowl, but you’ll never have to worry about making sure they’re properly inflated. Baller Yoga: Official Red/Black LXXII, $1,000 Mattel Ultimate Justice League RC Batmobile What comic books don’t tell you is that tearing through the streets in an unlicensed muscle car equipped with machine guns and rocket launchers is just as illegal as whatever heist Batman’s latest foe is trying to pull. But you can legally get a taste of what it’s like to drive the Batmobile with this two-foot long RC replica based on Batsy’s ride in DC’s Justice League. It’s got rotating machine guns, a working exhaust that bellows smoke, and a camera in the cockpit that streams a live view of the action to the mobile app you used to drive it. Even Bruce Wayne would be jealous of this toy. Mattel: Ultimate Justice League RC Batmobile, $250 Spin Master Star Wars Hero Droid BB-8 Despite being set a long time ago, our own galaxy hasn’t quite caught up to the awesome technology seen in Star Wars— and that unfortunately includes droids. Having your own robotic companion is the dream of many introverted Star Wars fans, and Spin Master’s Hero Droid BB-8 is as close as they’ll get without spending months trying to build one. It rolls, it talks, its head lights up, and it even responds to voice commands. It also comes with a wireless remote that can be used to manually maneuver BB-8, or you can slip it in your pocket and have BB-8 autonomously follow you around the house like a puppy that never needs to be housetrained.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image caption Officials said many people died as their homes collapsed due to the storm At least 39 people have died in fierce dust storms across four Indian states since Sunday evening, with officials warning of more bad weather to come. High-speed winds and lightning devastated many villages, bringing down homes and leaving dozens injured. The northern state of Uttar Pradesh reported the highest death toll - 16. More than 70 people had died in dust storms in the state earlier in May. Officials told BBC Hindi that casualties could go up further. Twelve people were reported dead in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, which was also severely hit by the storms. Nine people were killed in the eastern state of West Bengal, while two people have been confirmed dead in Delhi. All three states remain on high alert as officials warn of more thunderstorms over the next few days. ""The danger is not yet over,"" Uttar Pradesh's relief commissioner Sanjay Kumar told BBC Hindi. India's Meteorological Department had issued a warning on Sunday before the storms hit, warning people to stay within their homes. Wind speeds were around 109 km/h (67mph) accompanied by thunder and lightning, officials said. Air travel in Delhi was also affected, with around 70 flights being diverted from the city's international airport on Sunday night. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter that he ""prayed"" for the speedy recovery of those who were injured and he asked officials to provide assistance.

Cringe at all the apps we wasted time and money on! Not talk about some of those gadgets that decent amount of money and seemed cool at the time, but now collect dust on a shelf!
Im especially interested in those last two, since Im willing to bet that we all have quite a few tech regrets this yearwhich could also include things like not deleting my Facebook even though I thought about it a lot, or botching that SSD upgrade and kicking myself for not having a recent backup of my data. 
While I have been thankful to not experience any catastrophic hardware issues this year, nor do I feel like I blew money on disappointing geeky toys, Im a little sad that I put offfor the second year in a rowmy grand plan to build a portfolio of my work on my personal website. 
I also took way too long to list some older computer components on eBaymy penultimate graphics card, mainlywhich didnt generate as much cash as they otherwise might have. Other annual lowlights include the time when I lost that annoying little adapter Apple gives you to connect your Apple Pencil to a Lightning cable. I had been so good about keeping that in the same, secure location, too.

"mgokey@businessinsider.com (Malarie Gokey), Malarie Gokey","Why you'll love them: PopSocket grips are fun, customizable grips for your phone that double as a stand when you want to watch videos. If you struggle to hold your phone one-handed, you need a PopSocket grip. These fun little grips stick on the back of your iPhone and pop out once or twice to give you the grip you need. You can also use your PopSocket grip as a stand when you want to watch videos or just prop your phone up on a table. You can get PopSocket grips in a bunch of fun designs, including everything from animals and fun prints to solid colors and branded designs from franchises like sports teams and fandoms. Most cost just $9.99, though there are more expensive designs for $14.99 and so on. I have one on my phone and I love it. I've bought several to give to family and friends. As someone who used to get hand cramps from an iPhone 6 Plus, I can say that PopSocket grips have actually changed my life for the better. It's easier to hold my new iPhone X, I have a secure grip so I don't worry about dropping it, and I can touch any part of the screen one-handed. The only downside is that PopSocket grips can be hard to unstick over time, so if you need to switch cases or something, you'll have a hard time. It also adds some thickness to your phone, so wireless charging may be a no-go with the iPhone X, 8, or Plus when you have a PopSocket grip on the back.

Darrell Etherington,"Independent watchmaker Defakto creates some stunning timepieces via its regular collection, but it has a new limited series that is particularly eye-catching. The new Defakto Stille Nacht is a collaboration with artist Friederike Bellman, and it uses a hand-painted star field to brighten and distinguish each watface for the 50-piece limited edition run. The Stille Nacht (‘Silent Night,’ in English) arrives just in time for the holidays, appropriately, and it offers no traditional time indices, but instead shows a dense surface of points that also feature lime so that they glow in the dark. The hands (or hand, if you prefer the single-hand configuration also available) aren’t coated with lume, so the star field will stand out on its own when in dim lightning conditions. As mentioned, that star scape is hand painted, airbrushed to make each of the 50-piece series totally unique. The watch features a 40mm face, a matte finish night-blue backdrop for the dial, a sapphire crystal and a Swiss-made Ronda 712 Quartz movement. It retails for around $320 US after conversion from EUR, without import duties. The watch can also be custom-built for either right- or left-handed individuals, and features a thin, 6.6mm case. It’s a visually stunning piece and a good deal for a one-of-a-kind watch, so definitely take a look if you’re a watch fan, or know one and are looking for a unique holiday gift to leave in their stocking.","Independent watchmaker Defakto creates some stunning timepieces via its regular collection, but it has a new limited series that is particularly eye-catching.

Brian Heater,"This year has been a rough one for Sphero. The Colorado-based toy robotics startup kicked off the year with dozens of layoffs, a result of tepid interest in its line of Disney-branded consumer products. Here’s a little good news, however. The company has raised another $12 million, bringing its total up to around $119 million, according to Crunchbase. The latest round will go into helping shape the BB-8 maker into an education-first company. “The recent round of funding has currently raised $12 million, and we anticipate at the time of final closing up to $20 million may be raised in total,” Sphero said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. Funding has/will come from existing and new investors and will be used for working capital as we engage in a larger strategy that focuses on the intersection of play and learning.” It’s a tricky play, given how overcrowded the world of coding toys is at the moment, but Sphero has long been building out its play in the space, in tandem with its more consumer-focused offerings. Following the success of its The Force Awakens BB-8 tie in, the company quadrupled down on its involvement with Disney’s accelerator, releasing high-tech toys based on Spider-Man and Lightning McQueen from Cars. “[Education] is something we can actually own,” the company told me after the layoffs were revealed. “Where we do well are those experiences we can 100 percent own, from inception to go-to-market.”","This year has been a rough one for Sphero.

Dan Kitwood/Getty Images A single lightning strike killed 16 people and injured 140 others in Rwanda. Two people are in serious condition, according to authorities. The likelihood of so many people dying at once from lightning is extremely low, making this an unusual weather event. KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — A Rwandan provincial governor says at least 16 people were killed and 140 others injured when lightning struck a Seventh Day Adventist church in the country's south. Rose Mureshyankwano said 140 churchgoers were injured and rushed to a nearby hospital, where two are in serious condition. Mureshyankwano said 17 of those injured are still in the hospital while the rest have been discharged. Lightning strikes are frequent across Rwanda, which has many hills and mountains, and the country's police record a number of human and livestock deaths. The governor said a similar incident occurred on Friday when lightning struck a group of 18 students, killing one. Last October, lightning killed 18 people in different parts of the country. The likelihood of a lightning strike killing so many people at once is incredibly low. In the United States, about 73 people are killed by lightning every year, but these deaths usually take place one-by-one, not in large groups.

Josh Constine,"For being the richest company ever with $243 billion in cash, Apple sure cuts corners in the stingiest ways. The hardware giant became the first trillion-dollar company week. Yet it’s tough to reconcile Apple earning $11 billion in profit per quarter with it still screwing us over on cords and keyboards. The “it just works” philosophy has slipped through the cracks of the money-printing machine. We still turn to Apple because it makes the best core products. But the edges of the customer experience have frayed like the wires of a Lightning cable. The key to Apple’s fortune is obviously selling high margin iPhones, not these ways it nickels and dimes us. But the company has an opportunity to raise its standards after this milestone, though, and win back the faith that could push it to a $2 trillion market cap. 1. Frayed Charging Cables Apple gives you that tingly feeling in the worst way. Can it not build Lightning cables and MacBook chargers a little sturdier? If you avoid losing one long enough to put in some serious use, it inevitably ends up splittling where the cord meets your iPhone or exits the laptop power supply. Whether it’s wrapping them in electrical tape or the spring of a retractable pen, people have come up with all sorts of Macgyver methods to make their Apple chargers last. It got so bad that Apple was sued into offering a MacBook charger replacement program, but that expired years ago. If these are what allow us to play with the fancy devices it invents, shouldn’t they get the same quality of industrial design? 2. Buried iTunes Subscriptions Cancellation Want to cancel your Apple Music subscription or some other service you got roped into with a free trial? It’s SUPER easy. First, click the totally unlabeled and generic circle with a blotch in it that’s supposed to be a profile picture icon. You should see a “Manage Subscriptions” option…but you don’t. Instead, you’ll have to know to tap “View Apple ID”. Once you auth in with the same face or thumbprint that opened your phone in the first place you’ll find the option to cut them off. And as thank you for this convenience, you’ll get to pay 30 percent extra on some subscriptions if you pay through Apple. It’s clearly exploitative dark pattern design. 3. Keyboard Claptrap The MacBook keyboard is the on-ramp to the information superhighway, yet a single grain of sand can cause a pile up. Renowned Apple pundit John Gruber called it “one of the biggest design screwups in Apple history”. The new butterfly key design Apple rolled out in 2016 can get jammed by dust, requiring a lengthy disassembly process often requiring a professional to fix. Suddenly your work grinds to a halt. Apple wouldn’t always cover this repair, even under warranty. It took a lawsuit and tons of public backlash for Apple to offer free fixes, and that still typically leaves you without a laptop for a few days. I’m typing this article on a cracked-screen 2013 MacBook Pro because I refuse to upgrade until they make the keyboard design more resilient. 4. Killing Affiliate Fees Blogs Rely On Apple benefits from a legion of blogs obsessing over its hardware and software, hyping up everything it sells. Just this week it returned that favor by announcing it will cut off one of their core sources of revenue. Websites would previously earn a 7 percent commission from Apple in exchange for affiliate link clicks leading to purchases on the App Store. But over the past few years, Apple has begun to sell ads inside the App Store too, competing for advertisers with those external blogs. It’s also built up its own editorial team that curates what’s featured, and apparently doesn’t want competition in being a king-maker. So in October Apple is shutting down the affiliate program that app review sites like TouchArcade and AppShopper depend on, potentially spelling their doom. 5. Dongle Hell What’s the opposite of “it just works”? Paying extra to lug around a slew of gangly cord connectors you need just to plug things into your laptop or phone. Dongles are the emblem of Apple’s abandonment of the user experience. A Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 dongle runs $50 while it will cost you $9 to plug in any pair of headphones from the past half-century once you’ve inevitably lost the Lightning dongle you’re allocated. Apple loves pushing us towards its vision of tomorrow, like Bluetooth headphones (that it sells) and USB-C fast-chargers (that it sells). But ditching headphone jacks and old school USB ports makes Apple’s latest devices incompatible with sanity. Even its own commercial shows musician Grimes struggling with her dongles. Sorry you can’t pass me the aux cord. I’m from the future.

Lana Bandoim,"Selfies took a dangerous turn for two young women in Bochum, Germany. Bochum police confirmed that the two unidentified women were trying to take their selfies outside when they were hit by lightning. The 23-year-old and 21-year-old women were later found lying on the ground by first responders. Their clothing was torn, but this isn't unusual after a lightning strike. It's common for clothes to be burned, torn, or ruined after a person is hit by lightning. Both women suffered injuries requiring hospitalization, and the 23-year-old woman needed resuscitation and had to be put in the intensive care unit. The 21-year-old told police that the last thing she remembered was using their phones while walking before the lightning hit them. They didn't notice the approaching storm. Bochum, which is located in the North Rhine-Westphalia state of Germany, was hit by strong storms this week, along with the rest of the country. According to the German Weather Service (DWD), North Rhine-Westphalia should expect more thunderstorms and tropical temperatures so locals should definitely watch their selfie game.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"Your traditional dopp kit ( or toiletry bag ) is a useful travel companion. It’s where you stick items like your toothbrush, comb, deodorant, or other grooming items essential for not looking like a slob. You need a tech kit for your electronic devices as well. A tech dopp kit centralizes all the dongles, cables, and adapters you’ll inevitably need on the road. It makes travel easier, since you don’t have to worry about losing anything when packing and unpacking in your hotel room, or at the airport’s security line. It all goes in the kit. What to Put in Your Tech Kit Before you put a single thing in your tech kit, you should do an assessment of the devices you have, and what you might need them for. If you don’t plan on giving any presentations on vacation, feel free to leave the Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter at home. If you’re bringing both an iPhone and iPad on your trip, you may want to include a pair of Lightning cables compatible with your battery pack and power adapter. Use a Toiletry Bag Your tech dopp kit doesn’t need to be filled with built-in cable organizers, multiple pouches, or elastic bands. A regular toiletry bag will do. You should opt for a water-resistant toiletry bag, just in case you’re like me and tend to spill water on every electronic device in your backpack. Long (and Short) USB Cables Your tech kit should be where you put your USB cables. Instead of bringing that dinky three-foot one, however, get some longer six-foot cables. When you’re be traveling, you’ll inevitably be plugging into outlets that aren’t in the most convenient locations. The extra few feet will really come in handy when the nearest outlet is halfway across the room. You should also include some really short USB cables for connecting devices to something like a laptop. You can find cables as short as six inches in length. Don’t Forget the Velcro Ties Need to organize your cables when you stick them in your kit? Attach and cut to size some velcro ties you can use to keep that tangle of cables organized and out of the way. USB-C (and USB-A) Adapters Including USB-C and USB-A adapters in your tech kit means that encountering brand new hardware won’t stop you from charging or connecting to it with your USB-A cables. They’re tiny, cheap ( Anker sells two-packs for around seven bucks), and will boost the longevity of the cables you already own since you won’t need to replace them. Some models plug directly into your device, and look like a flash drive with a female USB port. Others look like really short charging cables, giving you a bit more flexibility when positioning your cable or device. If you opt to purchase the small, cord-free adapters, you should stick those inside yet another bag, like a coin purse. No one likes rooting around for items the size of pocket change. Benson Leung, an engineer on Google’s Pixel team, was doing God’s work by risking his Chromebook… Read more Read Battery Pack Of course, you should include a battery pack in your tech kit (especially if you don’t own one of those fancy battery-equipped suitcases). Which battery pack you include in your kit depends on what you’ll be charging. Some include built-in Lightning or Micro-USB cables so you don’t need to think about where you put your cable when you need to charge your phone. You can get USB-C-equipped battery packs as well if your tech is more current. Bluetooth Tracker You probably don’t want to lose the bag holding the dongle and cables you need to stay connected and online. If you’ve got some room left in the bag, throw in a device like a Tile tracker to keep an eye on your bag. The company’s newest trackers, Tile Pro, use Bluetooth LE to connect to your phone at a range of up to 200 feet. Lost your kit? Report your Tile as lost and other Tile users in the area will automatically find and report your kit’s location to you. 2-Port Power Adapter A two-port power adapter is recommended so you can charge without having to choose which device deserves some juice. Simply charge both your primary device (like your smartphone) as well as your portable battery pack. Everybody wins.","Your traditional dopp kit ( or toiletry bag ) is a useful travel companion.

Stephen Shankland,"With a chunk of electronics fitted to the side of my iPad Pro, I have glimpsed the future of computing. I've been putting Sanho's HyperDrive USB-C Hub for the 2018 iPad Pro through its paces, trying this six-port dock that plugs into the USB-C port in Apple's newest iPad Pro models. And it works. The $99 dongle transformed my iPad Pro suddenly into something a lot more like a traditional laptop. We won't know for months or years how closely together Apple plans to bring Macs and iPads, but the USB-C hub moves the convergence ahead by about a year. It takes as much advantage of the USB-C port as Apple allows, letting you plug in 3.5mm audio devices, HDMI monitors and TVs, regular and micro SD memory cards, your charger and other USB-C devices, and accessories like Ethernet adapters that use the old-style rectangular USB-A connector that's been a fixture on laptops for decades. The Sanho HyperDrive USB-C Hub attaches to an iPad Pro's USB-C port. Stephen Shankland/CNET It's not for everybody -- and the market already is limited by the steep price of a $799 11-inch iPad Pro or $999 12.9-inch model, not to mention Apple's $179 or $199 Keyboard Folio Case that the tablet productivity crowd also likely will want. But if you want to get as much as you can out of your iPad Pro, Sanyo put its hub on sale Monday at Kickstarter. Sanho has a good track record on Kickstarter, funding 15 projects and raising $7 million. The Silicon Valley company set a $100,000 goal for its iPad Pro USB-C hub. Early-bird funders can get the hub for $49, and those shipments should begin in January. Making the iPad more like a traditional PC There's been years of discussion about how well tablets can replace ordinary Mac or Windows laptops. There's no doubt they're becoming gradually more capable, and Apple has encouraged the trend for its higher-end iPad Pro models by advertising its computing abilities, selling external keyboards and, most recently, replacing Apple's proprietary and limited Lightning connector with the vastly more flexible USB-C port. But with only one port on the side of the iPad Pro, you've got to pick your choices carefully. Want to import photos from your camera? Disconnect the external monitor first. Want to edit your podcast audio wearing your nice headphones? Better charge up your iPad first, because there's no way to plug in a power cable at the same time. Sanho's accessory is compact for the job it does -- roughly 1 inch wide, 4 inches long and the thickness of the tablet, with refined manufacturing -- but it puts a big lump on the the iPad's otherwise sleek design. And of course if you plug a bunch of cables and cards in, your tablet will look really ungainly. But our wireless-everything future hasn't arrived yet, so that's the price you pay for now to let the iPad flex its muscles more. The hub, available in silver or space gray to match the iPad Pro colors, comes with a removable bracket that helps hold it steady against the side of the iPad in case you have a bunch of cables weighing it down. That's particularly useful for bulky HDMI cables that plug in along the top. The bracket can be removed so you can plug the hub into a Mac or other USB-C equipped computer, too, or if you have an iPad case that gets in the way. There's no trouble using the hub with the Apple external keyboard. Audio and power at the same time The hub's top feature is letting people use nice headphones or speakers connected with the 3.5mm jack while keeping the iPad plugged into power, Sanho Chief Executive Daniel Chin said. ""With our dock, you can listen to your music and charge your iPad Pro at the same. You can't do that with any of Apple's adapters,"" he said. Other possibilities: connecting both MIDI musical instruments over USB-A and headphones over 3.5mm audio; copying photos from a memory card while looking at photos on an external monitor; and using a full-size external keyboard and monitor like an ordinary laptop user. All of course while connected to power. I'm in the digital photography camp, and one reason I bought the iPad Pro was for travel. The Sanho dock could help here. When I get back to my hotel or car, I'd like to be able to charge the iPad as I handle the photos. If I'm adding video editing into the mix, the 3.5mm audio jack could be handy, too. (I wish I could import photos from an SD card directly to Lightroom instead of having to use Apple's Photos app as a middleman, but that's not Sanho's fault.) Success -- but with caveats I tried a variety of devices: my TV over HDMI, an SD card with photos, my Ethernet cable connected with a USB-C dongle, some nice earbuds with a 3.5mm audio connector. Mostly things were fine. I have some caveats, though. My Ethernet cable was flaky unless I plugged its dongle first into the hub and then plugged the hub into the iPad. And I could only get full HD resolution at 1,920x1,080 pixels, not the 3,840x2,160 my 4K TV offers. Finally, I don't see much point in using a full-size external keyboard since you'll likely want your hands near the iPad touch screen given that the iPad can't handle mice. It ain't pretty, but it works. Stephen Shankland/CNET For the Ethernet problem, Chin warns that connecting dongles to other dongles is a problem-prone proposition. And although Apple supports 4K and even 5K displays connected to the iPad, it recommends its own cable -- the more expensive $39 Thunderbolt 3 cable, not the feebler USB-C cable Apple ships with the iPad Pro. USB-C utility The bigger picture here is that the HyperDrive hub shows off what's possible with USB-C. Even though some operations were possible with Apple's Lightning port, multipurpose docks weren't an option. And the HyperDrive hub will fit into other devices -- like a MacBook laptop -- with a USB-C port. Expanding up beyond the Apple-certified world of Lightning accessories poses some compatibility problems, but I expect the benefits of having a broader ecosystem of devices will outweigh them. Just being able to use the same laptop charger and battery packs on an iPad Pro, Mac, and Android phone is very useful. I'm hoping iOS will gradually unlock other USB-C abilities. Storage would be nice, so I could plug in external hard drives or flash-memory thumb drives, but I've mostly moved to wireless file transfer with cloud services like Dropbox. The bigger shortcoming in my eyes is the inability to use a mouse or trackpad. Also on my wish list is support for USB security keys from companies like Yubico to help us fix the shortcomings of passwords. Apple is the gatekeeper here. If it chooses to let USB-C and the iPad Pro meet their full potential, the HyperDrive dock only will become more useful. CNET's Holiday Gift Guide : The place to find the best tech gifts for 2018.

Ara Wagoner,"OnePlus is no stranger to introducing exclusive colors and variants for its phones down the line — like that beautiful Star Wars 5T and Avengers OnePlus 6 — but usually variant colors for a new model come months after the device's launch. The Lava Red OnePlus 6 came two months after the white and black models, but luckily for us colorful phone fanatics, Christmas came early this year. Like the ground-shaking roar following the lightning of the 6T's launch, here comes the Thunder Purple OnePlus 6T. Unlike the ultra bold candy apple shine of the Lava Red OnePlus has offered for the last few models, Thunder Purple is a more subtle affair, sophisticated with its black/purple gradient and a shifting, curving S that portrays the actual lightning strike down the glass back of this phone. OnePlus themed this phone around a thunderstorm at sunset, lightning carving through the fading light of day, and that bolt shimmers and shifts with the light — it's not formed by an actual rise in the 6T's black silky-smooth back. Like lightning, it's never in the same place twice. The gradient between storm-black clouds and purple sunset — the hue here feels sandy and soft, like it's fighting the last golden rays of sunset — starts about a quarter of the way down the phone, between the alert slider and the power button, which are both color-matched to the gradient. The purple volume rocker cuts back up into the darkness a bit, like a little cloud-to-cloud bolt. From glass back to metal bumper and buttons, from the bottom speaker grills to the top pinhole mics, this gradient colors all but the front display — a slab of inky black caressed and embraced by a powerful purple storm. The experience inside is the same top-tier experience we praised in our full OnePlus 6T review — the in-display fingerprint scanner has been as finicky for me as it has for Daniel Bader and Harish Jonnalagadda, but the software is lightning-quick. I am still a mere three days in with this glazed gradient gemstone of a phone, but here's what I've come away with so far: While I am getting some misfires between swiping Back and Home, I think the biggest issue to be fixed with OnePlus' gesture navigation is that the keyboard is way too far down without the nav bar to type comfortably without either propping up the phone with my pinky — which is mad at me for doing so — or using a phone grip. Speaking of gestures, the screen-off music controls are dope and I am addicted! You can also set five gestures — that's right, five — to open apps, toggle the flashlight, open the camera, or automatically start recording a video. Between that screen-off shortcut for video recording and the Emergency Rescue feature, this phone is perfect for young women who travel alone, work late, or need an extra bit of invisible protection. And it's cute, too! OnePlus' free, drop dead simple system theming is wonderful — especially the custom hex color accents. Can Google's Android team implement it for ecosystem-wide dark theming? That's all I want for Christmas. The lack of wireless charging I can honestly forgive — I tend to use cases and phone grips that don't play nice with it — but this phone needs proper, IP-coded water resistance. You only have one port to worry about now, there's no excuse left for forgoing it. The OnePlus 6T Thunder Purple come with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and if you were planning to grab that configuration already, you should absolutely buy this limited edition color right now — it's probably not going to last long. Then join in the hunt for a case to showcase its magnificent purple majesty! $579 at OnePlus The other hot ticket item from OnePlus this holiday season — the new OnePlus Explorer Backpack — arrived at my door alongside the OnePlus 6T. I've been dying to put this pack through its paces, and what better time to stress test a backpack than Thanksgiving travel?

Rhett Jones,"It’s finally here. Apple’s long-awaited feature that is intended to keep bad actors from bypassing Apple’s encryption and breaking into your phone is now available. On Monday, the component went live in the latest iOS update and you should just go ahead and download it. The feature, dubbed USB Restricted Mode, works by shutting off access to the Lightning port on your iPhone if the device hasn’t been used in the last hour. Law enforcement has recently begun using secretive tools like GrayKey and Cellebrite to hack into iPhones of suspects, and disabling the lightning port is believed to be a key factor in circumventing those methods. While institutions like the FBI like to complain that they need special workarounds for encryption in order to keep us safe, any security flaw only serves to put our private data at risk. Apple isn’t in the business of antagonizing police, so this update arrives without making a big deal out of the feature. We wouldn’t recommend downloading a major overhaul of an operating system without spending some time with it first, but this is a minor update. USB Restricted Mode isn’t even listed in the brief summary of changes on the download screen, and iOS 11.4.1 mostly serves to fix a few tiny bugs. What’s more, it’s enabled by default once you’ve installed the update. But just so you can feel the comfort of knowing it’s working, you might as well double-check that it’s turned on. First, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Updates and download the latest release. Once it’s installed, go to Settings &gt; FaceID and Passcode, and look for the toggle labeled USB Accessories. It looks like this: I don’t know if Apple’s copywriters are just having a bad day or if that explanation is intended to confuse you into leaving the setting alone, but you leave the option toggled off. With USB Accessories switched off, USB Restricted Mode is turned on. Congratulations. This should not lure you into a false sense of security. There have already been reports that Grayshift found a way to circumvent Apple’s latest attempt to lock unauthorized individuals out of your private data. That’s just the way information security works—the job is never done. Doing crimes is dumb. Doing crimes on devices that are connected to the internet is dumber. The only other big feature with this update that you should be aware of is a fix that should improve the Find My AirPods feature. As Engadget points out, some users ran into trouble when trying to use the feature to find the last location of their incredibly easy to lose headphones. This should solve the problem. Happy hunting.

Brian Heater,"Turns out those rumors that Beats wouldn’t have anything to show off during today’s big Apple event weren’t 100 percent true. Granted, there was no mention of the headphone maker during the event itself. Instead, the company sent out a bit of an also-ran press release as things were still unfolding here in Cupertino. The big reason the brand got no love during today’s event: these aren’t new products, really. Rather, they’re color updates to two of Beats’ existing lines. In fact, the new shades were designed to match Apple’s new hardware. Fittingly, the headphones are priced to match their corresponding handsets.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"For the past week I’ve been writing, swiping, and doodling with Apple’s 10.5-inch iPad Pro. As a fan of my older iPad Air 2, the more capable iPad Pro feels like a step in the right direction, save for one issue: that damn Apple Pencil. In a move that prioritizes form over function, the company made a delightfully sleek object that completely fails at taking advantage of its form factor. Here’s how to do what Apple, for some reason, didn’t. Why Clip Your Pencil There’s a pretty straightforward reason you should attach a clip to your Apple Pencil: it lets you treat it like a traditional writing implement. The Apple Pencil’s completely rounded design means it is more prone to roll around your desk, or right off your table and onto the ground. In addition, adding a clip lets you, of course, clip it anywhere you’d stick a regular pen. That means you can store it in your pants or shirt pocket, clip it to a pocket in your folio, or attach it to your iPad Pro’s case itself. It’s a no-brainer add-on, and a bit of a curious omission from the original design. Get the Right Clip New Orleans attorney Jeff Richardson, whose site is geared toward lawyers who use iOS devices, suggests purchasing the Fisher Chrome clip to attach to your Apple Pencil. The clip is silver, matching Apple’s own chrome accents on the Apple Pencil. You can attach the clip to your Pencil by removing the Lightning port cover and sliding it over the top, or slide it up the pen, starting at the narrow tip. Fisher itself sells the pen cip for $2.00 on its site, though you’ll have to shell out at minimum $5 for shipping. The price is well worth the boost in functionality, and is definitely another reason to keep your pen close at hand instead of stuffed wherever you put the rest of your cables and dongles until you need them. iOS 11 brings a lot of new and exciting features to the iPhone and iPad. It also brings a lot of… Read more Read There are other ways to stabilize and modify your Apple Pencil, though they aren’t as elegant (nor do they attach directly to the pencil like the Fisher clip). You can slip your Apple Pencil into a magnetic rubber sleeve from Moxiware, letting you attach the pencil to your iPad’s magnetic body while protecting it in a brightly colored rubbery sleeve (it comes in six colors, including white and black).","For the past week I’ve been writing, swiping, and doodling with Apple’s 10.5-inch iPad Pro.

Kyle Hyatt,"Lightning's Strike electric motorcycle packs 180 pound-feet of torque into a slightly more relaxed sportbike-like chassis.
Lightning Motorcycle
After months of teasing, the Lightning Motorcycles' Strike is making its debut, and it looks promising, if not all that we hoped it would be.
The base model Strike still comes in at the $13,000 price point that Lightning has been teasing, but its 70-to-100 mile range at that price point leaves something to be desired. That being said, the base model's 10-kilowatt-hour battery can still be Level 2 charged in around two hours. If you want DC fast-charge capability on anything but the top-tier model, that will cost you an additional $1,500.
The base Lightning's performance -- range notwithstanding -- should be pretty decent though, with 90 horsepower on tap and a full 180 pound-feet of torque available at zero RPM. Stepping up to the top-of-the-line 20kWh model gets you an additional 30 horsepower. The base model bike weighs 455 pounds, while the Carbon Strike tips the scales at 485 pounds.
Details on the suspension and brake components for the two lower-power models are a little scarce, but if you shell out nearly 20 large for the Carbon Strike edition, your bike will come with brakes by Brembo and suspension by Öhlins. You'll also get an AIM dash with lap-timing abilities, and you'll get your bike as early as July.
Previous press releases from Lightning left us with a few questions about where the bike would be manufactured, since $13,000 is a relatively low price point for an electric motorcycle. Well, it happens that the answer isn't as straightforward as ""Made in America."" It's more like ""Made in America, sort of.""
The bike undergoes final assembly at Lightning's new facility in San Jose, California, but its components come from all over the world. Lightning isn't giving us specifics on that, but it's not uncommon for a vehicle's various parts to come from many vendors around the world, and frankly, as long as the quality control from Lightning is good, we're OK with that.
So, in the end, was our excitement for the Strike justified? Kind of. Is it the world-beating, revolutionary, affordable electric motorcycle we were hoping for? At its entry-level price point, not really. The lack of standard DC fast charging across the range and the limited range of the base model aren't ideal. The pricing structure that Lightning has going reminds us a lot of the one used by Zero.
From a performance standpoint, we expect that the Strike will be a blast to ride. It's not exactly a featherweight, but its combination of adequate power and stellar torque should be fun, and the slightly relaxed sportbike-like form factor should mean that it will do an excellent job of straightening out your favorite canyon road.
The real test will come when we get to throw a leg over it.","The new, more affordable entry-level model from Lightning Motorcycles will start at just under $13,000 -- but is it worth it?",2019-03-28T17:38:03Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}","Lighting Motorcycle's Strike has struck, but is it the bike we wanted? - Roadshow",https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/lightning-motorcycles-strike-debut/,https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/iYTY2fBIIdaI9X_SBduHk9CQQpU=/2019/03/28/85a11345-6808-424d-80fe-60367fc66b25/right-mid.jpg,,Cnet.com,lightning,1

Dieter Bohn,"We just got a look at the new iPad accessories Logitech announced today: the $49 Crayon and the $99 Rugged Case. They are really nice, but they are not for you. Both accessories are specifically designed to sell to the education market and will not hit general retail. Let’s start with the Crayon because it’s fascinating. It’s half the price of the Apple Pencil and works a little bit differently. It does not need to be paired via Bluetooth. Instead, any Crayon can work with any iPad. Apple says that’s so a teacher can walk around with it and use it with student devices. Since it doesn’t pair via Bluetooth, it can’t do pressure sensitivity. However, everything else works the same. It can measure angle, handle palm-rejection, and it’s just as precise. It charges via Lightning, with a little rubber grommet on top to cover the hole. It also has another feature the Apple Pencil lacks: an honest-to-god on / off button. That means it’s not just a passive stylus; 9to5Mac says it uses a “special wireless frequency.” It seems as though the Crayon will only work with the most recent generation of iPads, not the iPad Pro or older iPads. It should last about eight hours on a charge, according to Logitech. Apple says this is the first (and so far, the only) MFI-approved third-party stylus for the iPad. And using it for just a minute or two, it came so close to being as good as an Apple Pencil that I was pretty bummed that it won’t be made available to the general market.",We just got a look at the new iPad accessories Logitech announced: the $49 Crayon and the $99 Rugged Case.

Kyle Hyatt,"The Lightning Strike's motor shares a number of design features with the 200-horsepower unit that drives the LS-218 superbike.
Lightning Motorcycles
When the folks at Lightning Motorcycles announced in January that the company would be releasing a more affordable electric bike aimed at a wider audience, we were pretty excited. Since the Strike's initial announcement, Lightning has been trickling out details about the platform, which is set to launch next month. The latest such detail might be the biggest yet.
On Thursday, Lightning released a photo of the new Strike electric motorcycle's motor along with a couple of pieces of information about its design. This photo is notable for a couple of reasons. First, we can see that the motor bears a significant resemblance to the unit found in the LS-218, and indeed, Lightning confirms that the two share some design features.
We also learn that the motor is liquid-cooled, also like the LS-218. This means that the drivetrain should be able to stand up to some pretty serious heat before being forced to throttle itself back to prevent damage. This type of thermal throttling is relatively common in electric vehicles of all types, two or four-wheeled. 
Lightning also talks about the Strike sharing the LS-218's ability to quick-charge. Based on the spec sheet for the LS-218, it will charge in 30 minutes when hooked to a DC fast charger or 120 minutes on a Level 2 charger. We don't know anything about the Strike's battery pack or battery management yet, but if it can match its big brother's charging specs, that's impressive.
Finally, the last thing that this teaser photo shows is a gorgeous-looking gold Öhlins monoshock tucked up in the background. We asked Lightning for clarification on whether the production Strike, or some variant of it, would be getting this high-zoot suspension, but so far the company hasn't responded.
The Strike is set to launch in March, and so far everything we've seen from Lightning on the bike -- which isn't much -- has been exciting. The electric motorcycle market is starting to heat up, but so far nobody has released what we'd consider the ""killer app"" in the segment. Maybe the Lightning Strike will be it.",The Strike could be poised to make things very tough on the likes of Zero and Harley-Davidson when it launches next month.,2019-02-14T23:12:15Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Lightning Motorcycle teases the forthcoming Strike's electric motor - Roadshow,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/lightning-strike-electric-motorcycle-motor-teased/,https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/Ad0CWypBHu8mMsSGYmhbCr4-hWo=/2019/02/14/5537d334-8fd3-4b6c-bf02-286fbd7317cb/lightning-strike-motor-1.jpg,,Cnet.com,lightning,1
Chaim Gartenberg,"The Nomad Wireless Hub is another new take on wireless charging pads, combining a regular Qi charger on top with a four-port USB charging hub hidden on the bottom for an all-in-one desktop charging solution that can charge up to five gadgets at once. The first thing you’ll notice about the Wireless Hub is that it’s big. Compared to the coaster-like thinness of most wireless chargers, Nomad’s offering is over an inch thick. It’s also pretty wide, which is good for anyone concerned about their phone sliding off and falling from that high up. It also leaves more room to miss the coil in the center of the charger. On the bottom, there are four integrated USB charging ports, which are largely the reason why the Wireless Hub is so big. There’s one USB-C port (supporting 3A output, which Nomad claims is enough to support quick-charging on an iPhone X assuming you’ve got a Lightning to USB-C cable handy), one USB Type-A (2.4A output), two USB Type-A (1A output), and a barrel plug for the included power adaptor. The wireless charger maxes out at 7.5W, which is enough for fast charging Apple’s iPhone X and iPhone 8, but not Samsung’s recent smartphones, which need 9W for their peak fast charging. At $79.95, it’s definitely a bit pricey, especially considering that there are plenty of cheaper chargers out there. But if you’re really interested streamlining your desk setup with a combined wireless charger and USB hub, you can probably make the math work. Size aside, the rest of the Wireless Hub is put together well, with a solid-feeling heft from the weighted base that other, smaller chargers lack. In another nice touch, the hub uses an ambient light sensor to automatically adjust the brightness of the LEDs, which glow orange while charging and light up white to indicate a full charge.

David Pescovitz,"Filmmaker Dustin Farrell spent his summer traveling 20,000 miles to film lightning around the United States. He used a Phantom Flex4K camera to capture these brilliant bolts at 1,000 frames per second. The film is called ""Transient."" “Lightning is like a snowflake. Every bolt is different,” Farrell says. “I learned that lightning varies greatly in speed. There are some incredible looking bolts that I captured that didn’t make the cut because even at 1000fps they only lasted for one frame during playback. I also captured some lightning that appear computer generated it lasted so long on the screen.” (via The Kid Should See This ) NASA published an animation depicting this years’ rough hurricane season in two smooth minutes.

Chris Taylor,"You may be a Last Jedi superfan. You may have seen Rian Johnson's galaxy-sized hit five, 10, 15 times. But will you ever truly see it unless you've chosen to be on the Light Side or the Dark Side — with special effects to match? Light Side and Dark Side versions of Last Jedi are a thing in Japan. In the rest of the world, FOMO is a thing. SEE ALSO: 'Last Jedi' gets thumbs up from 89% of viewers, says new poll The special screenings, first reported by THR, come courtesy of 4DX, which describes itself as ""the world's first 4D cinema company."" Launched in South Korea, 4DX seems the epitome of gimmicky — it tilts and rumbles the seats, it sprays smells and fog, it adds wind and strobe and lightning effects. It can even blow bubble into the theater. Gimmicks they may be, but they're also increasingly popular. There are 4DX theaters in 51 countries now, and their average occupancy — roughly 40% full — is above the movie industry average. ""Laser blasts and lightsaber strikes shown on screen are accompanied in the auditorium by seat vibrations that help fans feel like they are in the middle of the most dramatic battles,"" reads the 4DX press release on The Last Jedi. SEE ALSO: 'Last Jedi' haters are nothing new. Plenty of fans hated 'Empire Strikes Back' too You also get a blast of air with every blaster fired, and presumably strobe lightning when — spoiler alert — the ghost of Yoda destroys the Jedi temple. The experience isn't completely immersive. With apologies to Rian Johnson, shown in this exclusive 4DX interview, there's no smell linked to the Porgs' appearance: However, only in Japan — probably the most Star Wars crazy country on the planet, where The Last Jedi still reigns supreme at the box office a month after its release — have the special light and dark versions of the movie been released. Theatergoers are asked to choose which side they prefer going in; their experience will be slightly different depending on their side. What those differences are, no viewer has yet reported back. THR claims audiences are split 50-50 on which side they choose, which sounds about right for all things Star Wars. It may be a novelty with only minor changes, but the concept is fascinating. A Choose Your Own Adventure style of moviegoing could reinvigorate an industry that is having trouble competing with the Golden Age of TV. We look forward to seeing 4DX screenings of Jurassic World 2 where you get to choose between human and dinosaur — or maybe a re-release of Captain America: Civil War where Cap fans and Iron Man maniacs get a different screen experience.","You may be a Last Jedi superfan.

AZI PAYBARAH,"[Read the full story on the explosion.]
Times reporters will be following the story all day, so check back for updates.
For now, heres what we know:
 The cause:Mayor Bill de Blasio said the light was caused by an electrical surge at a Con Ed substation in Astoria, at the northern tip of Queens.
A Con Edison spokesman, Bob McGee, said early this morning: What people were seeing was an electric arc flash. The electrical arc of that magnitude is similar to a thunder and lightning event. The sound people heard was the arc striking the ground.
The Police Department described it, bluntly, as a transformer explosion. The reason for the explosion remained unclear this morning. The authorities have not mentioned any possible contamination from the blast.
 The impact: Power was shut down at La Guardia Airport, near the plant, for about 45 minutes and flights were grounded. A few dozen homes briefly lost power.","The world didn’t end, but things sure seemed dicey for a few minutes.

Neer Varshney,"Lightning Network, a technology often touted as the solution to Bitcoin ’s scalability problem, has been growing leaps and bounds in popularity in the recent months in spite of being at a nascent stage. The technology has been tested successfully for processing micro-transactions swiftly. But it seems Lightning Network still struggles with transferring bigger amounts. Lightning Network can only ensure 100 percent success rate for transactions of up to three cents, a report by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests. The publication found that anytime someone uses the Lightning Network to transfer a sum larger than $5, there is 50-percent chance the transaction could fall through. The chance of failure is even more striking with bigger amounts. Sending $490 – the maximum amount currently allowed on the network – has only one-percent chance of success. Diar sourced the data from Reddit user YeOldDoc who used lnmainnet.gaben.win to plot the probability of successfully routing a payment between random nodes on the Lightning Network. YeOldDoc made the calculations based on how many nodes have the capacity to route a payment of that size. One interesting takeaway from the Diar research is that despite its rapid channel growth, Lightning Network has yet to improve the transaction efficiency of its system. As pointed out by Cornell University computer science professor Emin Gün Sirer, the number of Lightning Network routes has grown 10 times in the past five months, but the probability of successful routing has not increased at all. Developers have been implementing Lightning Network payments for fun activities online in order to test its utility for micro-transactions. This includes playing Pokemon with it, buying candies, or doodling penises on a graffiti board. But, we are yet to see any implementation for payments above a few dollars. The total network capacity of Lightning Network crossed $150,000 in April with more than 2,000 active running nodes and 6,600 channels. At the time of writing, the total network capacity seems to be still nearly the same, with more than 2,500 nodes and 7,800 channels. Lightning Network acts as a “second layer” to a payments blockchain, allowing for faster transactions with very little transaction fees. The Network works by creating “channels” between nodes. Any two nodes on the Lightning Network can agree to hold their coins on a common wallet. The channel is essentially a multi-sig wallet — where the consent of both parties are required before funds can be moved out. This wallet is then registered on the blockchain. This process means that the wallet now acts as a ‘payments channel,’ which can be used to pay the cryptocurrency without requiring to register the transaction on the blockchain. When they finally close the channel, the resulted transaction is recorded on the blockchain as one transaction. This allows the two parties to carry out swift transactions with low fees, as their transactions don’t have to wait for miner confirmations every time. This doesn’t mean that you need to create a channel every time you want to transact with someone. You can use existing channels of the people you are connected with. But there is a catch. For the transaction to go through, everyone involved in the transaction will have to be online. This includes you, the person you are sending the money to, and, if you are using someone else’s channel, then they have to be online as well. In addition, the channel — you are making the transaction through — should have enough funds to support your transaction, that is, twice the amount of the transaction value. This is what gives rise to the payments not going through for larger amounts. Through current means, if you want Lightning Network to process large transactions, you need nodes that can create larger channels that can always be online. Clearly, individuals are less likely to fit the bill. Large cryptocurrency exchanges can create Lightning channels to increase its network capacity and increase the probability of transactions going through. But as Diar points out, opening up a Lightning channel will likely land them in regulatory trouble. The exchanges are required to perform know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks on users of their platforms. Through Lightning Network, while you can do this for channel creators, they can’t control where the actual transactions are routed. It is important to remember that the technology is still in its nascent stage. With subsequent improvements, and an increased number of nodes (therefore, channels), it might ensure that Bitcoin lives up to its creator’s vision as a peer-to-peer electronic form of money that can be used for everyday transactions.

The Canadian Press,"TAMPA, Fla. Although they trail Tampa Bay by 14 points in the standings, the Toronto Maple Leafs are having some head-to-head success against the top team in the NHL.
Mitch Marner scored a go-ahead goal late in the second period, Nazem Kadri and Patrick Marleau each had a goal and an assist, and the Maple Leafs beat the Lightning 4-2 on Thursday night.
""I think we embrace the challenge of playing against the best, and I think we've proved time and time again even though there's tough parts to the season we compete with the best,"" Kadri said. ""I think that's an important note to take out of this game.""
Frederik Andersen stopped 36 shots and Zach Hyman added an empty-netter for the Maple Leafs, who had lost five of seven.
""We showed we're a pretty good hockey team when we work this hard,"" Andersen said.
Tampa Bay got goals from Brayden Point and Victor Hedman, and Andrei Vasilevskiy made 27 saves. Nikita Kucherov, the NHL leader with 76 points, had an assist after two straight games without a point.
""We had our chances, they had their chances,"" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. ""We had some good looks.""
The Lightning have a 14-point lead in the Atlantic Division over Toronto. Tampa Bay's nine-game home winning streak ended.
The teams are currently lined up for a potential second-round playoff series.
The Maple Leafs lost the first meeting between the teams 4-1 on Dec. 13 despite outshooting Tampa Bay 49-21 and hitting the post or crossbar four times during the opening 30 minutes.
The final two games of the season series are March 11 and April 4 in Toronto.
Toronto took a 3-2 lead with 5:11 left in the second when Andreas Johnsson made a nifty backhand pass from behind the net to John Tavares, who sent the puck through the crease to a wide-open Marner.
Marner reached 60 points in 46 team games, tied for fourth-fastest in Maple Leafs history. Only Lorne Carr (39 games, 1943-44), Darryl Sittler (40, 1977-78) and Doug Gilmour (41, 1992-93) did it quicker.
The centre is also the first Maple Leafs player to begin his NHL career with three consecutive 60-point seasons.
Tavares finished with two assists.
Both goalies made strong saves during the third. Andersen went post-to-post to stop Kucherov's shot, and Vasilevskiy reached back near the goal line to grab Auston Matthews' shot that went off his glove.
Andersen faced 16 shots in the third.
""Excellent, especially down the stretch,"" Kadri said. ""We needed him. He's been the backbone of our team.""
After Marleau ended a nine-game goal drought with his 11th of the season at 13:06 of the second, Hedman pulled Tampa Bay even at 2 just 37 seconds later.
Marleau has 546 goals overall, 30th on the career list. He has 695 assists.
Point opened the scoring 9:48 into the game on his 30th goal during a power play. The centre became the first NHL player to have at least 30 goals and 30 assists this season.
""They're a team that's kind of built like us,"" Point said. ""They do a good job of taking away time and space.""
Toronto tied it 1-all two minutes later on Kadri's goal.
Lightning star Steven Stamkos finished minus-two but had 10 shots on goal, six shots blocked and missed the net on two.
NOTES: Toronto reached 60 points in 46 games, which tied the team record (1934-35, 1950-51 and 1961-62) for fewest games needed. ... Point has 13 power-play goals. ... Kadri stopped a 10-game goal drought. ... Stamkos got his 350th assist on Point's goal. He has six assists over the last five games. ... Tampa Bay C Tyler Johnson left with a lower-body injury.

MLHS Staff,"Mike Babcock addressed the media after his team’s 4-2 win over the league-leading Tampa Bay Lightning on Thursday night, ending the Lightning’s nine-game home winning streak.
On the team’s bounce-back performance:
I thought we had a good effort tonight. I thought we had everybody on board. I thought Fred was real good in the third, obviously, and down the stretch. But I thought our team played well. We could’ve had a lot more. I thought their goaltender was good, too.
It was a good win for our team. We haven’t been as sharp here as lately, as you know. I thought this was a good response. We talked a lot about it — getting back on track, working hard, and doing it right. I thought we did that tonight.
On his team raising its “compete level:”
For sure. It was a very competitive game. There wasn’t a whole lot of room for either team, especially through two periods. I thought our guys really dug in there and worked hard and competed hard.
On what clicked for Nazem Kadri and Patrick Marleau, ending their goalless slumps:
That’s a great question. Patty hadn’t been on the board in a while. Naz, obviously, wasn’t as good the other night. Was it just Kapanen being with them? I don’t know, but they had a real good night for us and set the tone and got us going.
On the Leafs PK adjusting and keeping the Lightning PP off the scoresheet after the 1-0 PP goal:
I thought the first one was a bounce… it comes right to him. We were hoping to get hit and it didn’t happen. They probably had some better looks later and it didn’t go in. But they’re a good team and you don’t want to be in the box at all. You want to play with discipline, but it was good killing by our guys. Obviously, Freddy was good.
On the Leafs avoiding a three-game losing streak:
I say it all the time: You always want your low spells to be as short as you can. This one, for me, got long. Now, we didn’t have Freddy for a while and all of that, but I still didn’t think we dug in like we could’ve. It was great to see. We’ve got to get back to work. You’ve got to work at a high level if you want to… If you’ve got skill and you don’t work, you don’t win anyways. You’ve got to compete at a high level.
On Auston Matthews raising his game of late:
I thought he was really good. I thought this last little while he’s been getting better and better. Any time you… I thought he got off to a great start this year. He got injured. You always have that initial real bump, and then reality sets in. But I think he is really digging in. I thought he was really good without the puck.
On Matthews’ abilities when he’s competing hard and using his size offensively:
He’s just such a big man and he can protect the puck. Physical on offense. He’s never really going to be that physical on defense; just physical on offense, Protecting the puck and hanging onto it and having it a lot. I thought that line was effective.","Mike Babcock Post Game, Leafs 4 vs. Lightning 2: ""This was a good response"" Maple Leafs Hot Stove Andersen leads Leafs in statement-making victory TSN Maple Leafs prove their mettle in impressive win over Lightning Sportsnet.ca NHL Rumors: Flyers, Jackets, Oi…",2019-01-18T04:08:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Mapleleafshotstove.com'}","Mike Babcock Post Game, Leafs 4 vs. Lightning 2: ""This was a good response"" - Maple Leafs Hot Stove",https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2019/01/18/mike-babcock-post-game-leafs-4-vs-lightning-2-this-was-a-good-response/,https://46wvda23y0nl13db2j3bl1yx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-29-at-10.40.52-PM.png,,Mapleleafshotstove.com,lightning,1
Mark Masters,"TSN Toronto reporter Mark Masters checks in daily with news and notes on the Maple Leafs. The Leafs and Tampa Bay Lightning skated at Scotiabank Arena ahead of Thursday's game. 
John Tavares didn't just get the game winner against his former team in Long Island on Monday, he also made franchise history by notching his 46th goal a new single-season high for a Maple Leafs centre. 
""I didn't know that,"" Tavares said with a smile. ""There's obviously been a tremendous amount of great centremen that have played for the Maple Leafs over the course of its history, so to do something like that is obviously pretty special.""
It was Darryl Sittler who previously held the record, scoring 45 in the 1977-78 season. 
""Awesome,"" Tavares said when informed it was Sittler he passed. ""Man, that's a pretty good player.""
Tavares, who picked up goal No. 47 on Tuesday, is now just three away from becoming the first Leaf since Dave Andreychuk in the 1993-94 season to reach the 50 mark.
""Hes brought to the Leafs what [Ryan] McDonaghs brought to us,"" observed Lightning coach Jon Cooper. ""Theyve had injuries, guys go down, and Tavares seems to be that stabilizing force.""
Tavares' longest goal drought this season has been just five games. 
Tavares wasn't aware he made Leafs history 
With 47 goals on the season, John Tavares has set a new Maple Leafs record for most goals by a centreman. It was a feat he wasn't aware of but is proud of the accomplishment knowing how many great centres have played in Toronto.
---
The Lightning, who reached the 60-win mark on Monday in Ottawa, have dominated the NHL all season and can tie the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings' league record for most victories in the regular season with wins in their two remaining games. 
""You want players feeling good about themselves going into the playoffs, but as soon as it's Saturday at 4 p.m. for us I dont think anyone will think of the regular season and what's gone on,"" Cooper insisted. 
That said, Tampa Bay has lost two of three games and getting back to their winning ways tonight is a motivating factor. The Lightning haven't lost three of four all season.  
""There really isn't some magic switch come playoff time,"" said captain Steven Stamkos, ""you want to be feeling good about yourself individually and you want to be feeling good collectively as a team heading into the playoffs. We just want to get our compete level up. Once that gets to our standard, that's when the skillset takes over and we look forward to doing that tonight.""
The Lightning have had some long playoff runs in recent years, including losing in the Stanley Cup final in 2015 against the Blackhawks. 
""I cant speak for the players, but I know I havent gotten over it,"" said Cooper. ""I don't think you ever really get over it until maybe you win one. Then maybe you get over it.""
""It was tough,"" recalled Stamkos. ""We thought we shouldve won that series, but it's a while ago now. Everyone talked about the lack of experience that we had in that series versus a Chicago team that had tons of experience. Well, our group has a lot of experience now so hopefully we can use that as an advantage."" 
Getting that experience has been a painful process. Last season, Tampa Bay lost in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference final against the Washington Capitals.
""If you look back on that series, though, we were probably fortunate just to get it to Game 7 after some of the performances our goaltender put in in Washington,"" Stamkos admitted, ""so I think we realized we werent good enough to win and that a team came in in Washington that had been lingering around for a while and has had a really good team and they were more desperate and wanted it more. I think that stung us more, that we faced a team that you could tell how badly they wanted it so hopefully we'll have that same attitude this time around.""
That may help explain why the Lightning have been able to maintain such a high level of play all season long. They haven't suffered consecutive regulation losses since November 10 and 13. 
""I tip my hat to the guys and how they performed this year, but if we're going to go anywhere we're going to have to take our game to another level,"" said Cooper. ""They are two completely different seasons and the way we look at the regular season is you get to open the door to get to play for the big prize. When you win 60 games theres something thats been consistently good about your team throughout, but, to be honest, you can't hang your hat on 60 wins when you get to the playoffs.""
Lightning trying to ramp up to accomplish their ultimate goal
Steven Stamkos talks about the pressure and expectations that the Lightning are facing heading into the playoffs and how difficult it will be to reach their ultimate goal of winning a championship.

Sarah Kossits,"The Montreal Canadiens continued their hunt for the final wild-card spot in their game against the first-place Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday night. The Canadiens put 45 shots on goal at the Bell Centre to defeat their opponents by a score of 4-2.
Lightning struck fast for the visitors and gave them what could have been a momentum-stealing goal just 2:28 into the game, but the Canadiens brought the game back to square one 10 minutes later. Steven Stamkos got credit for the early goal that got by Carey Price, since his backhand from behind the goal line went off the leg of Max Domi in the crease and then into the net, giving the Tampa Bay captain his 43rd of the season. 
Stamkos unwillingly gave Nate Thompson the opportunity to put his first goal as a member of the Canadiens behind Tampa netminder Eddie Pasquale, who made 41 saves in Tampas loss. Thompson had the puck in the slot and waited for more traffic to pile up, and ultimately it was Stamkos who completely took away Pasquales view in an attempt to block the shot. The screen allowed the puck to find the back of the net for Thompsons fifth of the year.
The Canadiens had two breakaway opportunities after the goal to take their first lead of the night, but both times Pasquale was there to make the save. The first was with his glove on a snipe from Brendan Gallagher and the second was a shot in the chest from Paul Byron, who was sprung on a breakaway by a great pass from Jordie Benn.
Pasquale continued his stellar goaltending to open the second period as he followed a cross-slot pass and stopped the ensuing one-timer, corralling the rebound before Jonathan Drouin could put it in the open net.
The Lightning had another early goal in the second period to put them back ahead by one, this time due to Cedric Paquette deflecting Adam Ernes shot by Price less than five minutes in.
The Canadiens continued to send a barrage of shots at Pasquale and eventually another one found the back of the net a little over three minutes after Tampa reclaimed the lead. Joel Armia netted his 13th of the season from behind the net, as his shot bounced off the Lightning goaltender and behind the goal line to make it a 2-2 game. By the end of the second period, the Canadiens had a 35-18 advantage over the Lightning in shots on goal.
With 14 minutes left in the game, it was Prices turn to impress the crowd with a series of big saves, keeping the must-win game for the Canadiens tied at two, and allowing Artturi Lehkonen to get the go-ahead goal for Montreal with 12 minutes remaining. Victor Metes shot went off the knee of a Tampa forward and headed to the front of the net, where Lehkonen knocked it down out of mid-air and then tapped it into the net to make it 3-2 Montreal. 
Domi put the puck in the correct net just two minutes after Lehkonens tally to put the game out of reach for the Lightning, netting the insurance goal for Montreal on a breakaway by sending the puck low glove-side for his 28th of the season.
The Lightning pulled Pasquale in favour of the extra attacker with three minutes remaining, but the Canadiens held on to defeat Tampa Bay 4-2.
Montreal was also done a favour by the Boston Bruins, who swiped two points of the table of the Columbus Blue Jackets to leave them at 94 points. The Toronto Maple Leafs werent so kind as they allowed the Carolina Hurricanes to take a 4-1 win, leaping into the first wild-card spot.

Dami Lee,"Apple announced new 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros in New York today, which now come with Face ID, a USB-C charging port, and a new Liquid Retina display. Aesthetically, theyve got slimmer bezels that only come in black, like the new MacBook Airs. The black bezels, when paired with the Smart Keyboard Folio, make the iPad Pro look closer to a laptop than it ever has before. They also allow for the 11-inch model display to fit a bigger screen into the same overall dimensions as the prior 10.5-inch model. The iPads also lose their home buttons entirely in favor of the iOS 12 gesture controls found in Apples new iPhones. Swiping across the various edges of the screen now brings up the home screen, lets you switch apps, and pull up the Control Center, Notification Center, and Dock. The new iPad Pros bring a redesigned Apple Pencil as well, which has gesture controls, a flat side to prevent it from rolling away, and a new charging method via magnetic attachment. Its sadly only compatible with the newer model, and first-generation Apple Pencils wont be compatible with the new iPad Pro, either. Besides aesthetics, what differentiates Apples current lineup of 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros from the old 10.5-inch iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad is the processors. The new iPad Pros use the A12X Bionic chip, which is found in all of Apples latest iPhones, meaning extremely fast performance with apps. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad use an A10X and A10 processor, respectively, which dont make a huge difference in speed when compared to each other, but are a downgrade compared to the A12X chips, which are supposedly nine times faster. Out of all three, the 9.7-inch iPad would definitely be considered the entry-level iPad. Then theres the issue of price. The cheapest you can pay for an iPad is $329, but if you go up to the 1TB storage option with LTE, the 12.9-inch model can run you up to $1,899. Thats quite the difference, so heres a chart to help you through the myriad features and options available when youre purchasing an iPad. iPad Pro specs comparison Category 12.9-inch iPad Pro (third-gen) 11-inch iPad Pro (third-gen) 10-5.inch iPad Pro (second-gen) 9.7-inch iPad Category 12.9-inch iPad Pro (third-gen) 11-inch iPad Pro (third-gen) 10-5.inch iPad Pro (second-gen) 9.7-inch iPad Resolution 2732 x 2048 2388 x 1668 2224 x 1668 2048 x 1536 Front camera 7 megapixels 7 megapixels 7 megapixels 1.2 megapixels Rear camera 12 megapixels 12 megapixels 12 megapixels 8 megapixels Stylus support Apple Pencil (second-gen) Apple Pencil (second-gen) Apple Pencil (first-gen) Apple Pencil (first-gen) Keyboard support Smart Keyboard Folio and Bluetooth keyboards Smart Keyboard Folio and Bluetooth keyboards Bluetooth or Smart Keyboard Bluetooth only Port USB-C USB-C Lightning Lightning Processor A12X Bionic A12X Bionic A10X Fusion A10 Fusion Storage 64 / 256 / 512GB / 1TB 64 / 256 / 512GB / 1TB 64 / 256 / 512GB 32 / 128GB Weight 1.39 pounds 1.03 pounds 1.03 pounds 1.03 pounds Price (Wi-Fi) $999 / $1,149 / $1,349 / $1,749 $799 / $949 / $1,149 / $1,549 $649 / $799 / $999 $329 / $429 Price (Wi-Fi + Cellular) $1,149 / $1,299 / $1,499 / $1,899 $949 / $1,099 / $1,299 / $1,699 $779 / $929 / $1,129 $459 / $559 Authentication Face ID Face ID Touch ID (second-gen) Touch ID (first-gen) Battery life 10 hours 10 hours 10 hours 10 hours Misc.

Angela Watercutter,"If the work of Pilobolus looks familiar, its probably because youve seen them on the Oscars. Or on YouTube. Though the dance troupe was founded in 1971 at Dartmouth College, the groups most recent spate of notoriety comes from its projected shadow play routines, multi-person performances done behind a screen that give the illusion that multiple bodies have morphed into animals, plants, and other objects. Ever since Pilobolus started doing the shadow routines, theyve gotten massive amounts of attention: trips to The Oprah Winfrey Show, work in car commercials, andyesa gig acting out the Best Picture nominees at the 79th Academy Awards. In 2009, they launched an entire Shadowland show, all based on the shapes people could act out with their bodies and maybe a few stretch-y pieces of clothing. ""Limitations are awesome for creativity,"" says Renee Jaworski, one of Pilobolus artistic directors ""They are super helpful, because if the world is your oyster then its really hard to make a decision. But when there are limitations there are rules and you work within those rules and suddenly you have to be creative to bend those rules and push the boundaries of what is possible in that world."" Recently, WIRED put that creativity to the test and asked Jaworskis dancers to do a lightning round, creating shadow formations on the spot based on images we gave them. The best one they pulled off? A Star Wars stormtrooper. After a little bit of plotting they got it allthe shape of the helmet, those angular eyes, that menacing grill. Pilobolus makes it look easy, but its actually just the result of years of practice. You have to be willing to fail, says Matt Kent, another of the troupes artistic directors, ""thats our guard against mediocrity."" Watch Pilobolus create a shadow stormtrooper and many more inspired shapes in the video above.

Mitchel Broussard,"If you unwrapped an Apple product today it likely came with one of the company's first-party Lightning cables, but having an extra on hand is always a good idea, so you can place it in other rooms in your house, in your car, or in a bag when you travel. For that reason, now's a good time to shop for third-party Lightning cables that are cheaper than Apple's own accessory, but still Made For iPhone certified to guarantee their quality. One of the best examples of this is well-known and reliable third-party accessory maker Anker, which has a 3ft / 0.9m Lightning Cable for just $5.99 on Amazon. Apple's comparable product, the Lightning to USB Cable, sells for $19.00 on Apple.com. Additionally, this holiday Anker has a combo promotion with the Lightning Cable. If you purchase the $5.99 cable (or other qualifying products), you can save 10 percent on either the Anker Elite Dual Port 24W USB Travel Wall Charger ($9.53, down from $10.59) or the Anker PowerCore 26800 Portable Charger ($55.79, down from $61.99). Anker has other cables, chargers, and power banks on its Amazon storefront. Many of Anker's accessories have been certified under Apple's MFi program, which helps consumers identify products that are assured to work well with iPhone, iPad, and iPod. Shoppers should keep an eye out for MFi certifications when shopping for products like Lightning cables, and be wary of counterfeit accessories that are somewhat common on Amazon and could potentially harm their devices.
