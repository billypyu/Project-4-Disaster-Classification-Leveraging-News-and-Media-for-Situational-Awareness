Rhett Jones,"“We’re a culture of builders,” Janelle Gale, Facebook’s VP of Human Resouces, says in a new video promoting the company’s lavish new office in Menlo Park, California. Gale believes that the recently completed piece of architecture accurately reflects the kind of culture that Facebook has built. We agree. For years, Facebook has worked with starchitect Frank Gehry to design its offices around the world. On Tuesday, the social network unveiled its freshly constructed office, MPK 21. “All the things we learned doing Building 20 prepared us for Building 21,” Gehry says in a slick video included with a blog post about his latest masterpiece. “We were getting lessons in Facebook culture. And we’re making a new kind of architecture within that culture.” Looking at the images Facebook shared, you might think that this is a fairly typical, over-the-top design for Gehry. The 89-year-old architect is revered for buildings like the Gugghenheim Bilbao, a museum designed to be as unique on the outside as the art that’s housed on the inside. But his work for high-dollar corporate clients can lean towards concepts that seem to only be there because he can get away with it. Being located in Northern California, it makes a certain amount of sense that MPK 21 incorporates redwood trees throughout its spacious open office setting. But as you see more images of the building, things feel chaotic and haphazard, rather than peaceful and integrated. Bloomberg got an in-depth peek at the building and its interior that’s worth checking out in full. It shows off a design that’s just throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. Clean, vibrant, aged and unfinished materials all mix in a smorgasbord of design trends, and lines go in every direction without any apparent purpose. There are many examples of the building resembling a pile of stuff that just fell together and is hanging by a thread, but none are more illustrative than this: Yup, that’s just, you know, the exposed frame of an office with some random boards on top. Odd details like this are found throughout the space. With captions like, “the main corridor runs down the middle of the building,” it’s hard to shake the feeling that Bloomberg was just as unimpressed as we are. Chaos is the word for it, it’s as simple as that. And if Facebook wanted to reflect its own culture and what its people work to build, chaos is the right approach. One might think it’s a bit weird to unveil a multi-million dollar office space on the same that day that a fresh expose of its platform’s disastrous effects in the Philippines is published. One might think it wise to hold off on bragging about the “tremendous scale” the building’s auditorium offers while Facebook opines that it’s just really difficult to scale-up content moderation operations in Myanmar in order to prevent genocide. One might think, hey, maybe you should wait until tomorrow’s Congressional hearing is over before you show off this modern monstrosity. But that’s just how Facebook rolls. Contrast MPK 21 with Apple’s famous spaceship headquarters and the contrast of corporate cultures comes into relief. Steve Jobs was reportedly a huge control freak during its development, obsessing over every detail. When it opened, its glass surfaces were so invisible that employees were getting injured as they smacked into them. That’s the most Apple thing ever. When Apple released an invite with the distinctive ring silhouette of its HQ, reporters immediately started speculating what it might mean. Whether or not its a clue to something larger, it also definitely means come to our building that looks like this and we’ll show you some new Apple shit. Facebook isn’t even close to having that kind of clarity when it comes to its company. But the Apple invite format would still work pretty well: [ Facebook, Bloomberg ]","“We’re a culture of builders,” Janelle Gale, Facebook’s VP of Human Resouces, says in a new video promoting the company’s lavish new office in Menlo Park, California.

DEBORAH NEEDLEMAN,"The variety of baskets in the world — with their distinct shapes and materials and techniques and uses — is endless. In the way that history can be told in words, so too can it be read through craft — objects ingeniously fashioned out of necessity from whatever was on hand. Almost any plant whose parts are pliable, or can be made so by soaking in water — including roots, vines, pine needles, grasses, stems, even trees — can be turned into a basket. Broad materials, such as palms in the tropics, are plaited like braids; narrow materials, such as grasses on the Savannah, are coiled like ceramic pots; while stiffer materials, such as willow in the lowlands, are woven like tapestry. Trade, migration and war have meant that techniques and styles spread and have often mingled. There is a beautiful spiral weave done in Burkina Faso that somehow made its way to the Dordogne in Southern France, where it was used for garden baskets. In South Carolina, the Gullah, descendants of slaves, made sweetgrass baskets using a coiling technique brought from West Africa by their ancestors. Photo Two different baskets, as depicted by the Irish painter Sampson Towgood Roch, circa 1824. Credit © National Museum Ni, Collection Ulster Museum Few places in the world, however, have as enormous a variety of basketry as England. Most are made of willow, a wonder material that is at once flexible, lightweight, strong, endlessly renewable and easy to cultivate. (Cut the tree to the ground and it will resprout; push a branch into the earth and it will take root.) In the way that Eskimos have 50 or so words for “snow,” the British have nearly 200 for their baskets. There were seven different types for the herring trade alone: for trapping, for sorting, for holding ice, and one, the quarter cran, made to precise government specifications as a measure for pricing. Each particular need — whether agricultural, industrial or domestic — would be resolved by a basket uniquely configured for the task. Well into the first half of the 20th century in Britain, there were wicker prams and mail carts; butcher delivery baskets (distinct from bakery baskets); carriers for messenger pigeons and ammunition drops; and containers for broadcasting seed and hauling brick. We tend to think of basketry as a rural endeavor, which it mostly was until the 1800s, when Britain began to rapidly urbanize. Industrialization, rather than signaling basketry’s demise, heralded a peak, as baskets were required to service the factories and towns. Basket-making became professionalized and specialized, with weavers — distinguished for the first time from growers, preparers, salespeople and repairmen — laboring side by side in workshops. This new breed of journeymen weaver underwent five to seven years of apprenticeship; each became proficient at many different baskets (sometimes over a thousand if you include all the variations). But during World War I, cheaper baskets imported from poorer countries, as well as wooden crates, were becoming more readily available; and by the 1960s, the English basketry industry collapsed under the weight of plastic. Of course, industry demands efficiency, but along with basketry’s diminishment comes the disappearance of the enormous breadth of knowledge embodied in those weavers. Just two of the men (they were all men) who trained under that 19th-century system — Colin Manthorpe, 80, and Terry Bensley, 79 — are still alive. They are sought out by some of today’s best makers, such as Adrian Charlton and Hilary Burns. The Devon-based Burns recalls that observing Manthorpe weave a herring cran was like “watching a dance; there was no wasted movement.” Despite the loss of this know-how, what had already vanished long before was something more profound, namely, the connection of a maker to his landscape, and the life that entails. Photo Three of O’Sullivan’s baskets. Credit Sophia Spring AFTER THE LEAVES drop from the willow, in January and February, O’Sullivan and McWalter, along with a few friends who have come to love these yearly outings, head into the cold, wet field to harvest the rods with secateurs, or pruning shears. It is physically demanding work, both the cutting and the stacking, as well as the carrying of the heavy bundles, and yet “it is easy to sound nostalgic,” O’Sullivan says. “There is this gentle connection to the land — and to one another. In the midst of the drudgery, which it is, you look up at blue sky or birds or you have a cup of tea. You pass each other and have an intense conversation for 15 minutes, and then you drift apart, and after a while you lose each other completely in the tall willow, and then you find your way back to one another.” Between March and May, the willow is sorted by variety and size and left to dry. On the short path between kitchen door and studio is the open shed where these satisfyingly neat bundles of willow — yellow, lime green, mocha, black — are leaning. After soaking the reeds for a day or two, O’Sullivan begins her work on the floor, using her knee or foot to hold the rods in places as she creates a base. Pushing long pieces in all around it, each of which she scores with a knife and bends upright to form the structure, she builds every basket stick by stick. O’Sullivan’s decision to fashion her life in this way is a choice that a country basket-maker in the past would not have had the luxury of making. Steeped as her work is in tradition, it is driven by her design sensibility (she invents her own forms), and her desire to live lightly on the land in an increasingly imperiled environment. A basket’s perishability is part of its beauty — it will last a few lifetimes before disappearing back into the ground. Until then, “I want these baskets to become part of people’s lives, to get battered, to be polished by their hands,” she says, “and to have crumbs and bits of wood in the bottom of them.” A version of this article appears in print on February 18, 2018, on Page M2170 of T Magazine with the headline: Baskets.

Amanda Kooser,"This shows one small section of the larger Curiosity panorama. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS The Mars Curiosity rover recently had the opportunity to pause for a moment and look back over its life's work. NASA invites us to admire the view, too, with a panoramic scene showing most of the rover's 11-mile (18-kilometer) path across the rocky landscape of the Gale Crater. Curiosity touched down in the crater in 2012. The rover is currently investigating Mount Sharp, a mountain in the middle. It snapped the images used in the panoramic vista several months ago from a vantage point called Vera Rubin Ridge. Vera Rubin was an influential American astronomer who studied dark matter. Curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada says the skies cleared up during the Martian winter, allowing Curiosity to capture some sharp images. You can even see the top of a hill that's 50 miles (80 kilometers) away outside of the crater. Follow Vasavada's narration of the vista in this NASA video and see a visualization of the rover's tracks: ""Even though Curiosity has been steadily climbing for five years, this is the first time we could look back and see the whole mission laid out below us,"" says Vasavada. The panorama is made up of 16 images from the rover's mast camera. NASA researchers processed the images to make it appear as it would under daylight conditions on Earth. You can see parts of Mount Sharp, dark dunes, rocky buttes and a now-dry stream bed cutting down the crater's rim. The whole panorama is big and impressive, so you will probably want to open it on a decent-size screen and enjoy diving into its details. NASA also provided an annotated version of the vista to help you put it all into perspective. The Curiosity rover has come a long way, but there's still much more to do. NASA says it will soon put the rover's drill back into operation to acquire fresh powdered rock samples for inspection.

Makena Kelly,"MTV is reviving its beloved, dystopian short-form show Aeon Flux with a live-action remake. According to The Hollywood Reporter, MTV has hired Teen Wolf creator and showrunner Jeff Davis to write the script and co-produce the show alongside The Walking Dead ’s Gale Anne Hurd. Hurd also produced the 2005 live-action film adaptation of the television series. Originally created by animator Peter Chung, Aeon Flux first aired in 1991 as a series of animated shorts on MTV’s Liquid Television anthology, eventually graduating to its own full half-hour format in 1995, which lasted one 10-episode season. The story is set after a complete environmental collapse has nearly eradicated the population worldwide, and it follows titular character Aeon Flux, a secret agent and skilled acrobat from an anarchist society called Monica. The society is locked in a feud with its nemesis, Bregna, a police state, where Aeon must travel frequently in the fight for her country’s cause. Very few additional details have emerged, but The Hollywood Reporter noted that an official announcement on the series is likely to come from MTV later this week.","There are very few details related to the remake, but The Hollywood Reporter noted that an official announcement on the series is likely to come from MTV later this week.",2018-06-12T19:56:45Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Beloved MTV series Aeon Flux will get a live-action reboot,https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17454194/aeon-flux-live-action-reboot-mtv,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hvIMe0W5BvXGXFwAmy-PQxKMaw4=/0x32:331x205/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11525305/aeonflux01.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,gale,1

Silverman and Owens said in a prepared statement that season two will explore “global, real-life horror stories that make this series unlike anything on television,” and that the upcoming season will be “scarier than ever.” Amazon has been taking a slightly more focused approach to original programming, renewing a handful of series for a second season in the past few months, including The Tick and Sneaky Pete.

Alex Dobuzinskis,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California fire captain Robert Veverka and his crew arrived in Redding, California, last Thursday night as gale-force winds whipped the Carr Fire into a flaming tornado. They spent the next 30 hours trying to save homes from the flames. Veverka and his team from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention (Cal Fire) had just come from another wildfire, using part of their 24-hour break between shifts to travel to Redding. That is becoming the new normal for firefighters, said Veverka, “Right now, it’s pretty much guaranteed we’ll go from fire to fire to fire, until everything is out,” the 34-year-old Veverka said in a phone interview. “Once you hit the three- or four-week mark, you’re just constantly exhausted.” The Carr Fire in Northern California, the largest and most destructive of 16 major blazes in the state, is exhausting firefighting resources in what authorities are calling one of the worst and earliest fire seasons in years. Severe, year-round fires have been trending the past decade across the U.S. West, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. California in particular has experienced its worst start to the fire season in a decade, in terms of acreage burned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Driving the wildfires are exceptional drought conditions in large areas of Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, along with abnormally high temperatures. Nearly all of California faces abnormally dry or drought conditions, according to the Drought Monitor agency. “We are concerned about firefighter fatigue and making sure that our firefighters remain focused and try to get a break when they can,” said Cal Fire Assistant Deputy Director Daniel Berlant. “The peak of fire season is ahead of us and we still have many more months to go in this calendar year,” Berlant said. PRISON FIREFIGHTERS Veverka overseas one of Cal Fire’s team of prison inmates who are placed on the fire line, in exchange for about $25 a day and a reduction of their sentences. In the “off-season,” he exercises every day to prepare for the demanding summer firefights. Some prison inmates are not as fit, and about five times a summer, a helicopter has to airlift prisoners suffering from heat exhaustion, he said. Crews typically work a 24-hour shift followed by a 24-hour rest period typically in a motel, Cal Fire officials said. After crews spend 14 days on alternating work and rest periods, authorities try to give them a two-day break, Berlant said. But sometimes crews must wait three weeks for their two-day break, he said. Veverka, from Alturas, California, and his crew have at times gone 40 or 50 days before receiving a two-day break, he said. Berlant acknowledged Cal Fire crews sometimes received such long assignments, but said it was rare. The Carr Fire, which has killed four civilians and two firefighters, has been particularly demanding for firefighters. The long shift Veverka and his crew worked when they arrived was typical of what other crews worked that day, according to the local fire chief. Shasta County Fire Chief Mike Hebrard told a news conference on Sunday that some were working 48 hours straight. “They were just going on pure adrenaline.” DECEMBER FIRE Veverka was activated to wildfire duty on July 1. In a typical year, his deployment winds down by the end of October. But California fire officials have repeatedly warned the fire season is getting longer and more intense. The Thomas Fire erupted in December in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and became the largest in state history. Higher temperatures have helped extend the period of wildfires by 60 to 80 days each year, National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Jennifer Jones said. The U.S. Forest Service has a different work shift structure from Cal Fire. Forest Service crews typically work 16-hour shifts, followed by eight hours of rest, with two days of rest after 14 days on assignment, officials said. Research has shown that, over time, it can take a long-term toll on the bodies of the men and women protecting homes, businesses and natural landmarks. “Over time, the body is not able to respond as well, and one of the things we typically see is firefighters get sick,” Joseph Domitrovich, exercise physiologist with the Forest Service, said in a phone interview. “It’s where their immune system, with repeated activity or fire work stress, they tend to get what we call ‘camp crud,’ which is an upper respiratory tract infection.” Physical exhaustion has also been blamed for a number of safety mishaps that have killed firefighters. For instance, four firefighters died in 2001 when they were caught in the Thirtymile Fire in Washington state. The U.S. Forest Service, in a report, said fatigue was a factor in the poor decision-making that led up to the deaths. The night before their deaths, the firefighters had only slept for one to three hours while traveling to the fire, the report said.

Laurel Wamsley,"Desiree Linden won the women's division of the Boston Marathon on Monday. She's the first American woman to win the race since 1985. Charles Krupa/AP It was a nasty day to run 26.2 miles through Boston. But American Desiree Linden pushed her way through a powerful headwind, cold rain and up Heartbreak Hill to triumph at the Boston Marathon — the first time a U.S. woman has won in 33 years. ""It's supposed to be hard,"" Linden told reporters after her victory, shivering with a laurel wreath atop her head. ""It's good to get it done."" The poor conditions turned the race into a slog. Linden's winning time — 2 hours, 39 minutes and 54 seconds — is the slowest time for a winner in the women's race since 1978, according to The Associated Press. The winning time last year, posted by Kenya's Edna Kiplagat, was nearly 18 minutes faster. It was a big day for American women, who claimed seven of the top eight spots in the race. Linden, a 34-year-old who lives in Michigan, wowed commentators when she waited for Shalane Flanagan while her teammate made a quick toilet break 45 minutes into the race. In the 2011 Boston Marathon, Linden came in second, just two seconds behind winner Caroline Kilel. She ran it in a personal best 2:22:38. Linden is also a two-time Olympian — she came in seventh at the 2016 Rio Games, and had to drop out a few miles into the marathon at the 2012 London Games due to a stress fracture. Desi Linden just told NBCSN that she stopped for Flanagan's porta potty break she assumed that she (Linden) was going to drop out soon, anyway, so why not help Flanagan.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"No, NASA hasn’t discovered life on Mars yet—but a new result makes it seem like maybe, at some point in the planet’s history, the conditions were ripe for some extraterrestrial beings. Maybe. The scientists behind experiments conducted by the Curiosity rover are today reporting two results that make the Red Planet’s story even more interesting. One group found carbon-containing organic matter in 3.5-billion-year-old rock. Another noticed the methane levels around Curiosity varied by the season. Combined, these results present tantalizing hints of a potentially habitable Martian past. From everything we can tell of the chemistry and the minerals deposited in the Gale crater where Curiosity is stationed, “we think it was a habitable environment,” Jennifer Eigenbrode from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center told Gizmodo. “It had the ability to support life—but doesn’t mean life were there.” NASA’s Curiosity rover has wandered around Mars’ Gale crater, a presumed ancient lakebed, since 2012. Part of its duties include sampling the dirt and the atmosphere for interesting molecules, like those that may reveal a history of life or habitability. The most recent studies, both published in Science, shed light on that history. The rover’s Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument cooked some of the Martian dirt and unlocked some long-hidden carbon-containing molecules, some with sulfur and others with relatively complex structure. “Perhaps they were from life, or maybe there was just an additional nutrient here for life,” Eigenbrode said. Organic molecules pop up frequently in space, but it’s neat that Mars had life’s building blocks during a time when many think it was more habitable. As for the methane, Curiosity’s Tunable Laser Spectrometer measured the methane levels in its surrounding atmosphere over five years. The levels averaged at 0.41 parts per billion by volume, but ranged from 0.24 to 0.65 depending on the season. Here on Earth, we associate methane with life, but it’s a mystery what could be causing it on Mars. Perhaps it’s some geologic process. “It probably indicates more active water in the subsurface than we understood,” scientist Kirsten Siebach, Martian geologist at Rice University not involved with the studies, told Gizmodo. On Earth, we have a process by which underwater volcanoes interact with rock, producing methane that feeds bacteria. Maybe there are subsurface Martian bacteria eating that methane, Tanya Harrison, director of research for Arizona State University’s Space Technology and Science (“NewSpace”) Initiative, told Gizmodo. But for now, there’s no evidence for any such bacteria. The methane is cool, whether it’s linked to life or not. “We thought Mars was dead internally,” Harrison said. “Now we have data to confirm that there’s a seasonal cycle, suggesting the methane is being generated by something.” All of the outside sources I spoke with said it’s important to be skeptical about claims of life, extinct or otherwise, on the Red Planet. After all, these are just organic molecules on their own, so we’re still in the stage of chemistry, rather than biology. Plus, scientists don’t know what the original molecules were before Curiosity heated the rocks to take the measurement, Utrecht University scientist Inge Loes ten Kate, who was not involved with the research, told Gizmodo. There’s so much left to learn about Mars. The Insight and ExoMars missions will teach scientists more about the planet’s geology and methane.

WINNIE HU,"Ms. Garcia said that her department continues to monitor sites where litter baskets are removed. In Harlem, there has been improvement on corners where household trash was often piled alongside litter baskets, she said. “We’re just not seeing the same amount of litter and trash on those corners,” she said. In Harlem, the removal of the 223 litter baskets still leaves more baskets there than in other neighborhoods, sanitation officials said. Currently, there are 1,399 litter baskets in Harlem, compared with 779 baskets on the Upper West Side and 719 on the Upper East Side. The officials also noted that the overall cleanliness of sidewalks in Harlem has improved in recent years, as reflected in city inspection reports. A total of 1,993 violations were issued to property owners for dirty sidewalks in fiscal year 2018, down from 2,434 the year before, according to city records. However, the number of violations during the same period for litter along street curbs rose to 6,079 from 5,796. Harlem residents counter that sanitation officials should be putting out more litter baskets and emptying them more often — not taking them away — and keeping a closer eye on the baskets to prevent misuse. “I’m an eighth-generation New Yorker,” said Christina Fernandez, an elementary-school teacher. “Never before have I experienced an intersection in New York without trash cans — and usually at least three out of four corners have them.” Gale A. Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, said she had received complaints for months about the missing litter baskets in Harlem, and more recently, the Upper West Side. Her office has sent multiple emails and letters to sanitation officials to protest the removal of the trash cans and to seek an explanation of the agency’s policy. “Residents asked for enforcement against dumping, more trash pickups and more trash cans, but it seems like what they got was fewer trash cans, a worsened dumping problem and even some inappropriate tickets,” she said. “The neighborhood deserves better.”","Trash collected on Sunday at Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and West 139 Street in Harlem, where the New York City Sanitation Department has taken away more than 200 litter baskets over the last year.",2018-08-19T22:18:35Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Harlem’s Trash Bins Were Overflowing.

Cecilia D'Anastasio,"Here we are, in 2018, with a new Sword Art Online anime series, this time about a woman playing as a loli avatar in a VR battle royale game. It’s not wholly bad, but like its predecessor, it fails to live up to its intriguing premise so far. Definitely not plucked out of a trash bucket of Google search-optimized otaku terms, Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online follows college student Karen Kohiruimaki’s foray into a virtual world created in the aftermath of the original (and fatal) Sword Art Online MMORPG. This time, it’s ostensibly safe. The VR devices of the past have been recalled, and, in the year 2026, apparently with all forgotten, VR experiences a resurgence in popularity. Gun Gale Online, the game within the anime, is the VR PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds of the future, in which the last team of gunmen standing wins. Karen, who is very tall in real life, is convinced to try out the survival shooter because it’s the only game that lets her be short and cute. With a bright pink uniform and a bright pink submachine gun she calls P-chan, Karen becomes the hyper-dextrous shooter Llenn. This is a game I wish existed in real life. It’s got RPG elements, like roaming mobs in an open world and pubs for players to relax in. It’s also decidedly battle royale, with a good twist: Every few minutes, scanners carried by the players reveal everybody’s location. That gets things going and makes hiding less of an option. I’m appreciative of these variations, since an anime actually replicating PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds might be 23 minutes of watching someone lie prone in a dirty bathroom. The design of Gun Gale ’s gameplay is poised to create lots of suspense, and it would if not for the poor storytelling habits that this show inherited from the original Sword Art Online. Mid-action, characters are explaining the game’s rules. Mentor figures introduce random, game-changing ideas in crucial moments, which always just feel like dei ex machina. The characters don’t even feel self-consistent. Karen, for example, vacillates between hyper-incompetent and hyper-competent in a matter of minutes. All the sudden, after never playing a VR game, she’s the “pink devil.” Okay, Gun Gale, seems legit. Karen’s character motivations suffer from a stunning lack of creativity: She’s self-conscious about her height, so she becomes a master VR gunslinger? Still, seven episodes in, Gun Gale Online has treated its female characters decidedly better than the anime’s earliest iteration. Women get each other into Gun Gale. Women dominate Gun Gale. Women watch Gun Gale. There isn’t an excess of unnecessary breast physics or senseless groping—thankfully, since Karen’s avatar appears to be about ten. Whenever the original Sword Art Online is brought up, one of the big criticisms I hear is that, despite its promise, it’s a bad shonen anime but a good harem anime if you’re into that. Gun Gale could be an excellent show where a girl who doesn’t feel comfortable with real-world beauty standards forges deep and gratifying relationships with gamers’ avatars in a virtual world. It could be a show where we watch Karen struggle over time to hone her battle royale skills and, in the process, learn the confidence she needs to succeed in real life. Instead, it’s just more blah anime about video games we wish existed.","Here we are, in 2018, with a new Sword Art Online anime series, this time about a woman playing as a loli avatar in a VR battle royale game.

Donnovan Bennett,"The Toronto Raptors lost 106-105 to the Brooklyn Nets in a game that will not be mistaken for a classic in execution but was competitive throughout and took overtime to settle. In a game that for long stretches the Raptors didnt deserve to win, Toronto missed an opportunity to close late and win comfortably. This game highlighted things that Nick Nurse has been harping on recently; things that eventually came back to haunt his team. The Raptors shot just 39 per cent, turned the ball over 15 times and had just three fast break points. On top of that, they were outrebounded by 19. The Nets, who snapped an eight game losing streak, were led by DAngelo Russell who had 15 in the third quarter and another six in overtime, finishing with 29 points on 13-22 shooting. The Raptors dropped to 21-6 on the season and still sit comfortably atop the league standings. The Nets, with their first win against Toronto since April of 2015, are now 9-18 on the season and 4-10 at home. Toronto had won 12 straight against the Nets before this one, which was their longest active win streak against any team. Here are some takeaways from a tough loss for the Raptors in a sloppy game by both teams. Another slow start This was another slow start for Toronto. Nurse took a time out with under five minutes played in the first quarter and with his team down 5-2. Things didnt get immediately better as the Raptors were down as much as 14 in the first half and had to go on a 23-7 run before eventually tying the game by halftime. Live by the three, die by the three The three ball has dried up for the Raptors in a big way. Toronto started the game 0-7 from three and they didn’t get much better. They went 2-8 from three in the fourth quarter and outside of Leonard were 6-29 all game. It was a microcosm of the game when Toronto missed a bunch of open three pointers in overtime including one at the buzzer by Fred VanVleet as Kawhi Leonard couldnt get a clean look to win it while being double teamed. Leonards offensive explosion and MVP campaign continues The value of Torontos best player was once again evident as he didnt get much help but still was effective. Kawhi Leonard finished with 32 points on 10-21 field goals and 5-6 from three-point range. This the eighth time hes scored 30 plus points this season, and four of those have come in the last five games. The best part of his game has been his shooting from beyond the arc which the Raptors badly needed. Leonard only missed one three against Brooklyn and in his last two games he’s 10-12 from distance. Leonard also scored all seven of the Raptors points in overtime. JV hot on offence The one player Leonard was able to rely on to help carry the load against the Nets was Jonas Valanciunas. The Lithuanian has found his stroke offensively after really struggling to find his rhythm earlier in the season. Valanciunas has put up 42 points in his last five quarters of basketball including a team leading 17 in the first half on Friday night. In his 14 quarters before that, he’d only scored 33. Lowrys struggles continue The blip on the radar that was Kyle Lowry s recent slump is now becoming a trend. Lowry shot 1-8 from the field for three points, and had five turnovers in his 36 minutes of action. He missed two wide open threes badly in overtime and turned down other open looks. Lowry has made just four field goals in his last three games. In the last four games hes averaged 35.8 minutes, 6.3 points, shooting 21.6 per cent from the field and 18.5 per cent from three, with 4.5 rebounds and 3.3 turnovers. On the bright side hes averaged 9.5 assists in that span including his 11 dimes on Friday night. His rough stretch started with the Raptors’ win against the Warriors and it was followed by missing a game due to back spasms. That added rest hasnt helped but he may get more of it because the Raptors need their all-star to get back to the all-star level he started the season with, and for him to be healthy, if they are going to contend for a championship in the spring. Small ball success The best stretch of basketball the team played was late in the fourth quarter where Nick Nurse got brave with his lineup. Leonard hit a dagger corner three to give the Raptors the lead off a great drive and kick from Danny Green to punctuate a 9-0 run in a 2:09 span before a Brooklyn time out with 2:33 left. That run was sparked by a small ball lineup that the Raptors havent unleashed in a big way but we may see as the schedule begins to get tougher. The lineup of Lowry, VanVleet, Green, Leonard and Pascal Siakam at the five was the group that got the Raptors back in the game. Raptors struggle late This loss dropped Toronto’s record to 1-2 in OT this season. Toronto has struggled to close out some tight games with clunky late game execution on offence and poor rebound recovery. Three of their six losses (Boston, Detroit, and Brooklyn) came down to the wire against Eastern Conference opponents. Two of them came in overtime and one was on a buzzer beater. Their last four losses have been by an average of 3.25 points. Next up: In a battle of MVP candidates that will be televised on NBA TV in the United States, the Raptors take on the team chasing them in the Eastern Conference standings when they host the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday.","Takeaways: Kyle Lowry’s struggles becoming a trend for Raptors Sportsnet.ca Quick Reaction: Raptors 105, Nets 106(OT) Raptors Republic Leonard starting to hit stride for East-leading Raptors TSN Game Recap: Imbalance dooms Raptors, as they lose 106-105 to Net…",2018-12-08T05:18:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sportsnet.ca'}",Takeaways: Kyle Lowry’s struggles becoming a trend for Raptors - Sportsnet.ca,https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/takeaways-kyle-lowrys-struggles-becoming-trend-raptors/,https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Kyle-Lowry-2.jpg,,Sportsnet.ca,gale,1

According to the National Weather Service, dry conditions will continue until a Pacific frontal system moves into the region Wednesday. That will bring rain to much of western Oregon, but could turn to ice or snow at higher elevations. The rainy weather will combine Thursday with a cold front to bring a mix of snow to the passes in the Cascade Mountains.

ROBERT D. McFADDEN,"Separated amidships, the stern section rode the mountainous seas, spilling its cargo, but lost none of its 33 seamen. Many scrambled topside from bunks, a galley and fire and engine rooms, closing watertight doors as they went, a precaution that enabled the half-ship to remain afloat for more than 14 hours. From the deck 40 feet above the waterline, and from compartments exposed like rooms denuded in an earthquake, seamen watched aghast as the bow section, with the bridge and radio shack, the captain and seven others, including most of the ships command staff, drifted away like an apparition in the storm. There had been no time for an S.O.S. from the bridge, and there was no transmitter in the stern. Over portable radio receivers, seamen in the stern learned that another tanker, the Fort Mercer, with 43 men aboard, had radioed an S.O.S. from 20 miles offshore. Coast Guard vessels and planes were on the way to the Fort Mercer, the broadcast said, but there was no word about the Pendleton. In fact, no one on shore yet knew that the Pendleton had split apart. Hours later, a Coast Guard plane found the Fort Mercer sundered in two sections. As rescue operations began there, a radar station on Cape Cod discovered to the amazement of officials that there were actually four hulks floating off Cape Cod. It was the first sign that two ships had broken apart in the gale. Aircraft soon identified the hulks closest to land as sections of the Pendleton, and a second rescue was mounted. Four Coast Guardsmen at Chatham Lifeboat Station, which was nearest to the Pendleton, volunteered for the mission. They were Boatswains Mate First Class Bernard C.

India TV News Desk,"Image Source : NASAScientists discover potential source of methane on Mars
An international team of scientists has for the first time identified a potential source of methane gas on Mars, almost six years after NASA's Curiosity rover first detected hints of the gas on the Red Planet, and which may aid in future space missions. The team, including researchers from the National Institute of Astrophysics in Rome, have found that methane gas detected by the Curiosity rover in 2013 may have been released from a layer of permafrost containing bubbles of the gas that was fractured by a geological event, the Guardian reported on Monday.
On June 16, 2013, instruments on Curiosity recorded a spike in methane in the Gale crater -- a 96 mile-wide bowl where the rover landed in August 2012. 
In the study, reported in the Nature Geoscience journal, the team analysed data from planetary fourier spectrometer (PFS) on the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter, to look for methane in and around the Gale crater from December 2012 to July 2014.
While the Curiosity rover measured a methane concentration of 5.78 parts per billion (ppb) in the Gale crater on June 16, 2013 the PFS recorded 15.5 ppb in the column of atmosphere above the crater, the report said.
The location, known as Aeolis Mensae, has a number of geological faults that may have fractured nearby permafrost and released any methane trapped inside. Alternatively, incoming meteorites might have broken the ice open, the report noted.
""Remarkably, we saw that the atmospheric simulation and geological assessment, performed independently of each other, suggested the same region of provenance of the methane, which is situated about 500 km east of Gale,"" said Marco Giuranna from the varsity.
The apparent presence of methane on Mars has fuelled intense speculation that the gas could emanate from microbial Martians beneath the surface.
Even if microbes were not the culprit, Giuranna said the gas would make the planet more habitable because it could be used as a source of carbon and energy. Humans could also potentially make use of methane trapped beneath the Martian soil to make chemicals and rocket fuel.",Scientists discover potential source of methane on Mars India TV News Scientists think they know what the source of methane in Mars' atmosphere could be Firstpost Scientists Find Likely Source of Methane on Mars NDTV Mars methane surge spotted from space BBC …,2019-04-03T03:12:40Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indiatvnews.com'}",Scientists discover potential source of methane on Mars - India TV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/science/news-scientists-discover-potential-source-of-methane-on-mars-512185,https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2019/04/d3brvdoxqaahf-k-1554261073.jpg,,Indiatvnews.com,gale,1
Morgan Winsor,"It's been three days since a prize-winning show dog disappeared at one of the world's busiest airports after being checked in for a flight.
Gale, a pure-bred American Staffordshire Terrier whose owners live in Amsterdam, was being shown in the United States by her handlers and had one final event in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday before flying home.
The handlers brought Gale and another dog to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, where they checked in for their KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight and went through security. Not long after the handlers boarded the Amsterdam-bound plane Saturday afternoon, they were informed that Gale's kennel was found empty when crews went to load her crate onto the aircraft. The handlers immediately called her owners.
""Me and my wife completely panicked,"" Gale's owner, Floris Van Essen, told ABC News in a telephone interview from the Netherlands capital on Monday. ""We were out of our minds. You can imagine it's horrific to hear that a dog is gone and nobody knows where she is.""
Van Essen said they've been in touch with the airport, the airline as well as the baggage handler, but being thousands of miles away and in different time zones ""isn't helping.""
""There's a sense of hopelessness and powerlessness because there's nothing you can do,"" he added.
Authorities and airport officials, including wildlife biologists on staff, have been trying to track down the dog ever since. Gale was last spotted Monday morning around 3:30 a.m. local time.
""The dog somehow got out of the crate and is now running around the airfield,"" Andrew Gobeil, a spokesperson for Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, told ABC News in an interview Monday. ""We have about 4,600 acres of field out there, from the airfield and from the woods area. So we're looking throughout the entire airport.""
""We're optimistic that we'll find Gale,"" Gobeil added. ""We understand how important the dog is to the family structure when we want to make sure that we get Gale home safely.""
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment Tuesday morning.
Gale's owners described the dog as ""friendly"" and ""loving,"" but said she is likely scared and skittish in an unknown area.
""We're really missing a family member,"" Van Essen told ABC News. ""We don't have any children, the dogs are our children. Her brother lives here, her mother lives here, and we really want her back home safe.""

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Mars is in opposition tonight, meaning it’s about as close and as bright as it’s going to get. To celebrate, Hubble has released new images of the dusty red planet, as well as of Saturn, which was in opposition last month. Opposition means the Sun, Earth, and Mars are lined up (and the Earth is at its closest point to the Red Planet), making Mars appear brighter than usual. Mars will be the closest it’s been in 15 years, only 35.8 million miles (57.6 million km) away, so it’s the best time to look at it through a telescope. But more importantly, you’ll be able to see the entire planet shrouded in the dust storm that currently threatening the Opportunity rover. “If you have binoculars or a telescope, you’ll be able to see some of the structure,” NASA scientist Geronimo Villanueva told Gizmodo. “It will look unresolved because of the dust storm.” It might sound like a bummer that the planet will look fuzzy, but it’s actually pretty amazing. There’s extreme weather happening on another planet, and amateur astronomers on Earth can actually see it. Opposition is a good time to study planets with the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits Earth. Hubble can provide something that experiments on the Martian surface and in its orbit cannot: crisp pictures of the entire planet. Scientists can monitor the evolution of the global dust storm over time in a single image. Plus, opposition allows for slightly nicer pictures. “If you’re doing astronomy, having a bigger body allows you to obtain higher-resolution images,” said Villanueva. This new image comes after a big few months of Martian news. The Curiosity rover recently found 3.5-billion-year-old organic molecules in Mars’ Gale crater. This week, the Mars Express spacecraft announced what appeared to be an enormous standing body of salty water about a mile beneath the Martian surface. All the while, a local dust storm on the planet’s surface went global, cutting off human contact with the Opportunity rover. If you’ve got a pair of binoculars or a telescope, you might want to look at Mars tonight (once you’ve finished looking at today’s lunar eclipse, if you’re in a place that can see it). Mars rises at 8:38 p.m. ET (5:38 p.m. PT) and sets Saturday at 5:29 a.m. ET (2:29 a.m. PT). Also, Jupiter and Saturn will still be shining brightly—Saturn was in opposition just last month.

WINNIE HU,"Nivardo Lopez, 36, the transportation department’s Bronx commissioner, said that when he was growing up in that borough, he used to go to Manhattan every week to visit relatives and friends, and to shop and eat along Dyckman Street. Though he lived near the University Heights and Broadway bridges, back then it never even occurred to him to walk. “Those bridges are what connect these communities, and for years, cars were the only safe way to cross,” he said. Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, said that the crossings not only provided a free alternative to subways and buses for those on a tight budget, but were also better for the environment and gave people another chance to squeeze in some exercise. “We should be walking, we should be bicycling, as opposed to getting in a car or subway,” she said. “It’ll be healthier. We’ll live longer.” The Madison Avenue Bridge, which was built in 1910, takes its name from a Manhattan street synonymous with the city’s advertising industry and tony designer boutiques. The bridge links East Harlem with Mott Haven, in the South Bronx, both communities whose residents have long struggled with poverty, asthma and obesity-related diseases such as diabetes. Though it will still be years before bike lanes are installed on the bridge, new protected bike lanes have recently been added on the Bronx side on East 138th Street for several blocks. Mr. Torres, the East Harlem teenager, said he cannot wait for the bike lanes to run all the way across. “I’d be able to go more often and get there safe,” said Mr. Torres, whose favorite deli is in the Bronx. “A bike lane would be really convenient.” City transportation officials have also made other improvements to that stretch of East 138th Street in the Bronx, where there have been a spate of vehicle crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists in recent years. A few blocks down from the bridge, a new intersection with traffic signals and crosswalks has been created across from a busy subway station for the No. 4 and 5 lines. Giant planters — and soon tables and chairs — sit in a crescent-shaped curve on the street where livery cars once parked illegally. Monica Ortiz, 50, a risk manager for a local moving company, said the improvements make it safer for her to walk around the neighborhood during her lunch break. “The traffic is so dangerous that I’ve lost count how many times I could have been hit by a car,” she said. But Benjamin Phillips, 25, a salesman at a car dealership, said he worried that more people would now descend on an already congested street. “It looks good, but I have mixed feelings,” he said.","The city said it plans to upgrade 13 crossings over the Harlem River with new bike lanes and pedestrian areas, better connecting Manhattan and the Bronx.",2018-05-04T18:33:17Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Making a New York City River More Inviting to Cross, by Foot and Bike",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/nyregion/harlem-river-bridges-bike-lanes.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/05/nyregion/05harlembridges-print2/05harlembridges01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,gale,1
Rachel Thompson,"Somewhere between the main course and dessert at a dinner party, I became aware of a colossal chasm in the way my generation and my parents' generation perceive sexual harassment. It was during a recent trip to my parents' home in rural Warwickshire, England, that I found myself embroiled in conversations with family friends and neighbours about sexual harassment and sexual correctness with women over the age of 50. SEE ALSO: Women endure a lifetime of sexual harassment even before they enter the workplace I learned that some women over the age of 50 feel that, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, we are in danger of entering an era of extreme sexual correctness, where men will feel under constant scrutiny when interacting with female counterparts. And, though I'd read—and rolled my eyes—at headlines about sexual harassment allegations going ""too far"", this was the first time I'd heard a view like this uttered aloud IRL. Needless to say, I did not share their views. The crux of our differences seems to lie in what we consider constitutes sexual harassment. Recent research conducted by YouGov found that older British women viewed certain behaviours as acceptable, while younger women deemed them inappropriate. Wolf-whistling proved to be the most divisive behaviour, with 74 percent of 18-24 year olds, and 59 percent of 25-39 year olds considering it inappropriate. But, four in 10 women over 55 say wolf-whistling is acceptable, and 27 percent even said it was flattering. Among the other behaviours—including winking, comments on attractiveness, and lower-back touching—older women were more likely to say they didn't have any strong feelings about those behaviours, while younger women were likelier to find them inappropriate. Mashable spoke to women over the age of 50 to find out their thoughts on sexual harassment. ""If it's someone putting their hand on a knee 12 years ago, I just want to laugh."" Gillian, 65—who prefers to use only her first name—said she's worried that the recent stories about sexual harassment in the news will make men reluctant to make any form of contact with women at work. ""It's sad if a guy can't smile at her when he's attracted to her,"" says Gillian. ""Men are frightened. It's gone to an extreme."" While Gillian feels it's a positive sign of progress that women can now come forward with their experiences, she's also worried that these stories will create a culture of sexual correctness, that she likens to political correctness. ""If you're not careful, it will be political correctness gone mad,"" she says. ""If you start drawing lines, nobody will be able to make any contact at all."" She says she doesn't know where the line is between what's acceptable and what's not, but she does feel that some allegations have gone too far. ""If it's someone putting their hand on a knee 12 years ago, I just want to laugh. It's ridiculous,"" she says. If they were groped or raped it's a different story."" ""I actually feel sorry for men having to watch every word they say."" Rachel, 59—who also prefers to go by her first name—says ""no woman should be harassed in any way at all"" but she ""feels sorry for men"" who might feel under scrutiny for what they say to women. But, she also feels that some actions—like wolf-whistling—aren't offensive. ""What used to be normal like a wolf whistle for example, some women would be offended,"" says Rachel. ""If a man said 'wow, you look lovely today,' it doesn't automatically mean he wants to get me in bed."" ""I actually feel sorry for men having to watch every word they say,"" Rachel continues. Not all women over 50 share these views, however. Deb Gale, 61, believes that the recent exposing of the predatory behaviour of powerful men has prompted a ""big shift"" in our perceptions of acceptable behaviour; something she views as positive and necessary. ""Women have been ignored, silenced, disavowed, and dismissed for too long. They have suffered for it,"" says Gale. Kimberly, 51, is not concerned about the implications for men in the workplace. ""Guys in the work place might need to start treating women with respect, and actually acting like a man of integrity,"" she says. ""I think the exposure of men’s inexcusable behaviour, and companies holding men accountable for that behaviour is wonderful for women in the workplace,"" Kimberly continues. Image: Shutterstock / StudioOneNine So, why do the views of women over 50 differ so greatly to those of millennials and Gen Z women when it comes to harassment? Talking to women over 50, it is clear that attitudes towards sexual harassment were greatly different when they were in their twenties. My mother, Nancy, 57, tells me that the workplace culture was very different during the 1980s, when she was in her twenties and just starting out in the world of work.""You learnt to, as my mother told me, grow sharp elbows"" when inappropriate behaviour took place. ""If you went to HR, you would fall foul of the system, it would be a risk to your job and not his job,"" says Nancy. ""The victim would be named and shamed and their career would be over. We don't want to go back to that, let's look at all that and say this cannot happen."" Colette, 67—who prefers to use only her first name—says men in workplaces were ""flexing a large sexual thuggish muscle they were developing."" ""The men would egg each other on and build their status on being able to hit on a girl and other lads would admire them for it."" Gillian says that harassment in the workplace when she was in her twenties was ""known about,"" but ""no one put head above the parapet."" Though the women I spoke to have very different views to me and my peers about sexual harassment and correctness, we are all in agreement about one thing. That it is sign of progress and hope that women now feel they can come forward with their stories about harassment.","Somewhere between the main course and dessert at a dinner party, I became aware of a colossal chasm in the way my generation and my parents' generation perceive sexual harassment.

Amanda Kooser,"The Curiosity rover's drill didn't get very far on this rock. NASA/JPL-Caltech When NASA's Curiosity rover overcame a motor glitch to once again drill into rocks on Mars earlier this year, it was a triumph of ingenuity and engineering. Drilling operations hit a small snag this week when the rover met a particularly unforgiving rock. You can see the slight indentation where Curiosity attempted to drill. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Curiosity touched its drill down on a target named ""Voyageurs,"" an interesting-looking rock in the Gale Crater. The drill worked as expected, but it just couldn't get deep enough into the rock to generate a sufficient amount of material for the rover to collect a sample for analysis. ""All evidence suggests that this rock target is one of the hardest yet observed in Gale crater,"" Curiosity team member Mark Salvatore wrote in a mission update from Tuesday. The geology of the rock raises a lot of questions about Curiosity's current location on the Vera Rubin Ridge. He wonders if the rock's hardness could be due to changes in water chemistry as these particular sedimentary rocks were deposited. Curiosity successfully drilled into a rock named ""Duluth"" back in May. There were no hitches that time. The drill generated enough material for sampling. The rover has moved on since Duluth and may now be exploring an area full of harder rocks. The science team will need to investigate further to see if Voyageurs is an outlier or an example of the current landscape. Salvatore describes the drilling impediment as ""disappointing,"" but says he's lucky to work with scientists and engineers ""who can collectively turn a frustrating sigh into a gasp of excitement as we think about our next observations and what more we have to learn about this interesting and foreign environment.""",It's a hard-rock life for the Curiosity rover on Mars.,2018-07-18T18:20:19Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",NASA Mars rover found a rock too hard to drill into - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-mars-rover-found-a-rock-too-hard-to-drill-into/,https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/tYzKwG9tL1yWs6P_I9Cggbun7_o=/670x503/2018/07/18/f2e95fb7-906d-408c-bc97-55b660303486/curiosityvoyageurs2.jpg,,Cnet.com,gale,1
JIM DWYER,"Photo Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of “Hamilton,” embracing Representative Adriano Espaillat on Friday night at Coogan’s restaurant in Washington Heights during a gathering to celebrate a new lease. Credit Jim Dwyer/The New York Times Coogan’s restaurant and bar, a civic fixture in Washington Heights for 32 years, reached a new agreement with its landlord late Friday afternoon, just three days after its owners announced they would be closing in May because of a demand for a $40,000 monthly rent increase. A wave of public support for the establishment, including from Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of “Hamilton” who has been a patron since his boyhood, led its landlord, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, to reopen discussions with the owners of Coogan’s. A lease extension was agreed upon shortly after 4 p.m. Friday. Terms were not disclosed. The restaurant, on Broadway between 168th and 169th Streets, was an anchor of the neighborhood in the years when that part of Upper Manhattan was racked with violence from the illegal drug trade. With roots as a traditional Irish bar, Coogan’s has become well-known as a multiethnic gathering spot. More than 15,000 people signed an on line petition supporting the restaurant. “NewYork-Presbyterian and Coogan’s are delighted that this has been resolved in a way that satisfies everyone involved, and that Coogan’s will continue to be a very special part of the Washington Heights community,” the hospital and the restaurant said in a joint statement. They acknowledged that Representative Adriano Espaillat and the Manhattan borough president, Gale Brewer, had been instrumental in bringing about the agreement. Also taking part was Luis A.

Andrew J. Hawkins,"Two years ago, Chinese drone maker Ehang came to CES in Las Vegas and promised to build a completely autonomous, passenger-carrying quadcopter that would revolutionize mobility. Many of us in the tech community chortled under our breath, wondering if such a thing was even possible, let alone advisable. Today, the company released footage of its first piloted test flights in China — and color us impressed: this thing is no joke. over 1,000 test flights with human passengers Ehang’s engineers put the quadcopter, dubbed the Ehang 184, through a battery of tests over the last several months, and with good measure. The company conducted over 1,000 test flights with human passengers, including a 984-foot (300-meter) vertical climb, a weight test carrying over 500 pounds (230 kilograms), a routed test flight covering 9.3 miles (15 kilometers), and a high-speed cruising test that reached 80.7 mph (130 km/h). Ehang’s engineers also tested the 184 in a variety of weather conditions, including high heat, heavy fog, night tests, and during a Category 7 typhoon with gale-force winds. Clearly, it would seem that Ehang heard our skepticism after its first announcement and it aimed to respond with supporting data. “What we’re doing isn’t an extreme sport, so the safety of each passenger always comes first,” said Ehang founder and CEO Huazhi Hu in a statement. “Now that we’ve successfully tested the Ehang 184, I’m really excited to see what the future holds for us in terms of air mobility.” The key word there is “mobility,” as it often is with these types of ventures. Ehang wants to put its egg-shaped, multirotor aircraft in use as an air taxi, shuttling passengers across dense urban environments. The company has said it would demonstrate this service for Dubai’s World Government Summit later this month, but a spokesperson didn’t respond whether that was still the case. Dubai is also working with Germany’s Volocopter on a similar air taxi service. If that doesn’t work, Ehang has permission from the state of Nevada to test the Ehang 184 at its FAA-approved UAV test site. The key word there is “mobility,” as it often is Ehang says the 184, which is all electric, can carry a single passenger up to 10 miles or roughly 23 minutes of flight. The person in the cockpit doesn’t do any piloting; they just input their destination and enjoy the ride. The company claims its aircraft is able to take off autonomously, fly a route, sense obstacles, and land. And if anything goes wrong, a human pilot is supposed to step in and take over the controls from a remote command station. Ehang sees luxury rides for rich folks as the first phase of this new market, with autonomous aircraft becoming more widely available at lower prices after fleets and flight paths have become well established, and, of course, once the cost of having a human pilot around is eliminated. Despite its early successful test flights, Ehang says it is making improvements to the aircraft. More emphasis will be placed on improving passenger experience and on adding an option for manual control, giving passengers with piloting experience the choice to operate the vehicle manually. In addition, the company has already developed and tested a two-seater with a payload of up to 617 pounds (280 kilograms). Ehang has proven that its autonomous aerial vehicle can fly, which is no small feat. But proving that it can scale up into a full-blown aerial taxi service is an entirely different challenge and something with which a number of giant, multibillion-dollar companies are currently wrestling. There’s a vertical take-off and landing gold rush going on right now, and Ehang clearly wants to prove itself a major player.

"Florida Today, Eric Rogers, Florida Today","Here's why a cruise ship left a couple in Mexico after a medical emergency.
 USA TODAY
Several passengers aboard the Norwegian Escape cruise ship were injured Sunday after what cruise officials described as a ""sudden, extreme gust of wind"" caused the ship to suddenly list on its return trip to Port Canaveral.
In a series of Tweets Monday morning, Norwegian cruise officials said the ship suddenly tilted under the force of an unexpected gale topping 100 knots, or about 115 mph.
""Several injuries were reported and those guests and crew received immediate attention or are being treated by the ships medical staff,"" officials wrote. ""There was no damage to the ship; she remains fully operational and continues her scheduled itinerary.""
The ship was heading back to Port Canaveral for an estimated early arrival Tuesday, officials said. Neither the current itinerary nor the next departure were affected.
The response was prompted by the report of a passenger on social media, who Tweeted: ""The scariest (expletive) just happened on this cruise. Chairs, tables, glass, people went flying to one side of the ship.""
The Norwegian Escape can carry up to 4,266 guests and a crew of 1,733. The cruise ship is expected to return to the Jetty Park area about 10:45 a.m., then dock at Terminal 10 about 11:30.

Sean Woodley,"The Raptors are good as hell. Even when they lose the odd game here or there, it will be important to not lose sight of that. This is the most talented team ever assembled in Toronto, and it wont last forever. So rather than getting hung up on the things the Raptors do poorly, this column is designed to appreciate the silver linings even when the score line doesnt favour the good guys. There are only so many games in a season why not enjoy all 82? This is What Didnt Suck for the Raptors 106-105 overtime loss to the Nets. ******* In many ways, the Raptors franchise has been defined by its relationship to the Brooklyn (née New Jersey) Nets. Torontos very first test of the NBA waters came against the Nets; their most important and also laughable trade was conceived with and lost to them; the mirage that was the 2006-07 season disappeared at the hands of Vince and his band of vastly superior and battle-hardened teammates; even the most purely enjoyable season the teams ever put together was stopped by a creaky, over-hyped and under-performing Nets squad. The Fuck Brooklyn sentiment runs deep in these parts. But in the moments after the Raptors loss to the Nets on Friday night, just hours before the clock flipped to midnight to ring in the fifth anniversary of the Raptors second-most pivotal trade, something dawned on me: The Nets dont matter to the Raptors anymore, and havent, really, since the end of that Game 7 in 2014. Sure, Friday nights loss was bothersome, the way Im sure its annoying for an older brother to get bested in a one-off by a younger sibling whose only driving purpose is to beat their superior just one freaking time. Toronto didnt play well. Nick Nurse s decision to go small against the Nets board-crashing front court both exposed the Raptors most well-known vulnerability and kept a cooking Jonas Valanciunas off the court when it mattered most. Kyle Lowry s 3-3-11 on 1-of-8 shooting was cool as a work of abstract box score art, but wasnt gonna win his team a damn thing. At some point someone on the bench is going to have to make a shot. Ultimately, though, Fridays loss means next to nothing in the aggregate for the Raptors. They did some stuff poorly, theyll adjust, and their wayward shooting will eventually regress to the mean. Meanwhile, as illustrated by the admittedly delightful post-game joy exuded by their players and fans, getting that win meant just about everything to the Nets; it is probably going to be the highlight of Brooklyns season, and it happened on December 7th. This was Brooklyns first win over Toronto since April 2015. Since the 2014 playoff match-up, the Raptors are 117 games over.500 and have won four playoff series; the Nets are the same number of games below but hey they did sign Treveon Graham in the off-season and basketball internet thought it was pretty cool. After two decades of torment, the Raptors have morphed into the Don to the Nets Michael... or is it Mark? Im unsure of this characters name. Brooklyn is beloved in NBA appreciator circles because they try really hard and shoot a thousand threes a game. Their dirty little secret: They do that because they have to; because if not for favourable math and max effort, they would be the most embarrassing team in the NBA. They would be the Bulls, without the exciting, lottery-drafted prospects, because they misplaced their first-rounders, though I cant quite recall where exactly... The Raptors used to be what the Nets are now; a talent-poor, bobbing life raft of a team done in by its own suspect dealings. The Rudy Gay trade sparked a change in that mottled complexion. In the intervening five years, the franchise has left its sad boy status behind. Yeah, there have been bumps and road forks and LeBron off-glass dunks along the way, but through all of that, Masai Ujiri, Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, Dwane Casey and now Nick Nurse and Kawhi Leonard have built the Raptors into a franchise that isnt defined by its shortcomings anymore. LeBrons gone west, and the Raptors are revamped, more dangerous and, as shown by this column, more arrogance-inciting than ever. Every Raptors victory, each season of 50+ wins, every All-Star selection and sterling performance on US national TV tilts the scales of team history towards the side of success, not sadness, being the prevailing tale of the team. Whatever lordship the Nets once held over the Raptors narrative arc has been muted by Torontos exemplary post-Gay slow build, every move pulled by Ujiri along the way done with an eye on turning the Raptors into a franchise to be envied. Now, they employ this goddamned dude, who plays the same position Gay did just five years ago. *** On January 27th, 2014, Torontos post-trade afterglow was still fresh, its sustainability still very much in question. With the Raptors trailing Brooklyn by one with 12 seconds left, this eminently memorable sequence unfolded. Patrick Patterson s game-winner that night carried heft. At the time, that win in Brooklyn felt like a must not just as a necessary W in the muck of a mid-conference traffic jam, but as a piece of evidence to help prove the Raptors legitimacy. Last night, so many years removed from that flash point of the euphoric trip that was 2013-14, Fred VanVleet s open-three pointer pinged off the rim and the final buzzer sounded, and the appropriate reaction was to shrug the shoulders, and continue on with the night. Thats not a game the Raptors needed. With a cushiony perch atop the East for the second straight season, losses dont bring a sting anymore, let alone against a team Toronto has so sufficiently handled for years. Kudos to the try-hards, moving on now to Sundays game against Milwaukee. Four times a year the Raptors are forced to think about the Nets because the schedule tells them they have to. Brooklyns presence is no longer an ever-looming cloud in the minds of Torontos fans or players or management. Maybe theyll land a lottery pick to pair with their collection of broken prospects and Caris LeVert. Maybe itll turn them into first-round playoff food come 2020. Whatever the case, the Raptors will not need to consider their existence outside of individual game nights for a long time yet to come. In fact, it may even be time to retire Fuck Brooklyn as a common refrain Raptors fans have long come back to for warmth and glee. Directing that kind of animus the Nets way implies that they actually matter.","What Didn’t Suck: The Brooklyn Nets don’t matter to the Toronto Raptors anymore RaptorsHQ Quick Reaction: Raptors 105, Nets 106(OT) Raptors Republic Takeaways: Kyle Lowry’s struggles becoming a trend for Raptors Sportsnet.ca Victoria's Secret model Kelly Gale…",2018-12-08T19:40:40Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Raptorshq.com'}",What Didn’t Suck: The Brooklyn Nets don’t matter to the Toronto Raptors anymore - RaptorsHQ,https://www.raptorshq.com/2018/12/8/18131158/what-didnt-suck-despite-fridays-win-the-nets-dont-matter-to-the-raptors-anymore-brooklyn-toronto,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GefVA_bfS73lnuMYHq6Zr1o0t_A=/0x275:2142x1396/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13611946/1078834812.jpg.jpg,,Raptorshq.com,gale,1
HT Correspondent,"Of the many swipes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi took at Congress president Rahul Gandhi in his last Lok Sabha speech, one was over his famous hug in Parliament that stole the limelight. At a meeting in Rajasthan’s Ajmer, the 48-year-old Congress president delivered his comeback. The hug was designed, Gandhi told a gathering of Seva Dal volunteers to counter hate.
“Modiji had hatred for me. I went and hugged him and finished the hatred for me,” the Congress president said.
Rahul Gandhi asked Congress workers to fight the “hatred” of the BJP and the RSS with love. He said that the Congress wants to defeat the BJP in 2019 general elections but not finish them off.
“If the BJP and the RSS abuse us, we must fight them with love. Modiji often attacks me and my family and says he will finish the Congress. I, on the other hand, went and hugged him in Parliament,” Gandhi said.

During a debate on the no-confidence brought by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in the Lok Sabha last year, Rahul Gandhi stunned Modi and the treasury benches when he finished his speech and walked over to the PM and hugged him. The Congress president then went back to his seat and appeared to wink. This provided ammunition to the BJP which said such acts are not for Parliament.
In his last speech in Lok Sabha on Wednesday before the 2019 elections, PM Modi didn’t miss a chance to take a jab at Congress boss. The PM said he learnt a lot of things after being elected for the first time to the Lok Sabha in 2014. “I got to know the difference between gale milna and gale parna (hugging and piling on). I got to know about aankhon ki gustakhiyaan (mischief of the eye),” he said.

On Thursday, the Congress president said that the 2019 polls will be a fight between ideologies. “It will be a battle between the RSS and the BJP’s ideology to divide the country and the Congress’s efforts to unite it. For the BJP, India is a product, for us it is a sea of people,” Rahul Gandhi said.
He also targeted the NDA government over the agrarian crisis in the country. The Congress president alleged that PM Modi made an empty promise of loan waiver to farmers, but wrote off bank dues of his industrialists.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Scientists working with the Curiosity rover used a piece of its navigation equipmentan accelerometer like the one in your cellphonein order to make an important measurement about Mars mysterious geology.
Curiosity is currently roving around Mount Sharp, a 5-kilometer-high (3-mile) mountain in the center of Gale crater. But its unclear whether the mountain is the result of the crater once being filled in and losing matter to erosion, or whether the mountain is more like a large dune of deposited material. Curiosity doesnt possess a scientific instrument to determine the nature of the mountainbut it does have force-measuring navigation equipment. So the scientists got creative. 
I realized you can download an app on your phone and, not with much precision, but you can measure [the force of Earths gravity] because your phone has accelerometers, the studys lead author Kevin Lewis, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, told Gizmodo. He figured he could do the same thing with Curiositys accelerometers, and perform some interesting science.
Gravimetry, or precisely measuring changes in the local gravitational field, is a useful way to understand the rocks beneath the surface, since an objects force of gravity increases with its mass. Apollo 17 had a gravimetry experiment to study the Moon, for examplebut Curiosity does not have a gravimeter. It does have a navigational system, however, which includes gyroscopes and an accelerometer for measuring changes in velocity, acceleration, and orientation.
The navigational system isnt quite as sensitive as a gravimeter would be, but the scientists made do. They acquired the data on the accelerations experienced by the rover, then adjusted it to account for things like Curiositys location on Mars as well as potential effects of temperature and elevation on the equipment. 
Their analysis revealed a surprisethe average density of the rocks beneath Curiosity was lower than expected. This implied that the dirt was much more porous, meaning it had more holes, than the scientists expected. They were further able to infer that the sediment wouldnt be very deep, since otherwise it would be more compacted or filled-in.
All of these points together seem to imply that Mount Sharp wasnt the result of erosion creating a tall peak, but instead it formed through sediment blowing into the already-formed crater resulting in the enormous deposit, according to the paper published today in Science.
My first impression was that its a clever engineering trick to use instruments onboard the rover that werent designed as science instruments to actually do science, Kirsten Siebach, Martian geologist and assistant professor at Rice University, told Gizmodo. She noted that the porosity value of the rocks was surprisingly high. She said the work seemed to confirm some previous observations of Gale crater but contradict others.
This pushes us to get a better understanding of what low-porosity rocks might behave like on Mars, she said. 
Measurements like these come with inherent limitations, such as the introduction of potential biases when trying to pick out which data to use and uncertainties from using an instrument for a task it wasnt designed for.
But this is science, and the paper reveals new information that gets us closer to knowing what really might be going on inside the crater, and should be considered alongside other experiments, simulations, and data. And there are more experiments coming up to build the body of evidence: Mars InSight will be able to tell scientists about the planets geology more generally based on how heat flows through the planet, while Mars 2020 will have ground-penetrating radar to collect subsurface information on its landing location, Jezero crater.
Its not the first time weve heard of scientists repurposing navigation equipment to do sciencebut this is a particularly ingenious one.
Lewis said: One of the things I really love about this study is that its my type of sciencefinding new ways to use existing data and MacGyver-ing a brand new science instrument.",Scientists working with the Curiosity rover used a piece of its navigation equipment—an accelerometer like the one in your cellphone—in order to make an important measurement about Mars’ mysterious geology.

Todd S. Purdum,"He bobbed, he weaved, he ducked, he evaded, declining to answer directly whether he viewed his accuser as part of a political conspiracy against him, or whether he personally believed that re-opening the FBI’s background investigation into his nomination would be the best way to clear his name. At one moment, Senator Richard Durbin’s relentless questioning on that last point seemed to render him speechless.

That Kavanaugh’s emphatic answer precisely mirrored Christine Blasey Ford’s measured certainty that he was the man who sexually assaulted her 36 years ago only served to underscore that a long day of riveting testimony had left Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination more or less where it was when the morning began, balanced on a bitter he said/she said partisan precipice, with many open questions remaining and just one likely be answered any time soon: Can he get 51 votes? “In the end, there is likely to be as much doubt as certainty going out of this room today,” Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, one of the Republicans who had been most insistent on holding the hearing in the first place. That Delphic assertion was about the only thing that seemed certain after hours of intense, emotional and diametrically opposed testimony by accuser and accused. Ford, a research psychologist with scientific training in brain function, held the committee spellbound all morning. When Senator Patrick Leahy asked what she most remembers of the night when she says Kavanaugh and another teenage boy locked her in a bedroom at a party, her answer was searing and unforgettable. “Indelible in the hippocampus,” she said, referring to the part of the brain where memory is lodged, “is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two, and they’re having fun at my expense.” But Kavanaugh’s afternoon testimony was if anything more emotional, as he struggled repeatedly, drinking water and sniffling to choke back tears, while he described the toll that the accusations of sexual misconduct had taken on him and his family after “my 53 years and seven months on this earth” in which he said no such allegation had ever been lodged against him. In a stunning abandonment of the typically tempered tone of judicial nominees, he lit into his Democratic critics on the committee, declaring, “You sowed the wind for decades to come. I fear that the whole country will reap the whirlwind.” In Donald Trump’s America, the hearing seemed yet one more grim moment in which left and right have dug in further, and nobody’s mind was really changed. By evening, the Senate’s Republican leadership had decided to hold a committee vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination on Friday and a floor vote on Saturday. “Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him,” the president tweeted after the hearing. “His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting. Democrats’ search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist. The Senate must vote!” Trump was reported to have been underwhelmed by Kavanaugh’s stolid defense of himself in a Fox News interview earlier this week, but he surely thrilled to Kavanaugh’s relentlessly pugnacious performance before the committee. Again and again, Kavanaugh interrupted his Democratic interrogators, turning their questions back on them. At one point, he went so far as to ask Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the daughter of an alcoholic who wanted to know whether he ever experienced memory blackouts from drinking, “Have you?” (He later apologized). The dynamic of the afternoon hearing changed sharply after Durbin peppered Kavanaugh with questions about whether he himself favored an additional FBI investigation into claims by Ford and others. “I welcome whatever the committee wants to do,” Kavanaugh said. “I want to know what you want!” Durbin rejoined. Kavanaugh seemed briefly stunned into silence. At that point, the Republicans abandoned their reliance on Rachel Mitchell, the sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona who had handled their side’s questioning of Ford and the first couple of rounds of Kavanaugh, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina jumped into the fray with a ferocious denunciation of the Democrats’ tactics and a defense of Kavanaugh. “To my Republican colleagues, if you vote ‘no’ you are legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics,” he said. The Democrats scored some technical debating points after that, undermining Kavaaugh’s credibility on small matters in an effort to impugn it on the central one. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island elicited some especially implausible defenses from Kavanaugh about his high school year book entry’s apparently celebratory reference to “ralphing,” which Kavanaugh acknowledged was a reference to vomiting but explained away by saying he’d always had a weak stomach, whether for beer or spicy foods. Kavanaugh described the yearbook’s cryptic references to “boofing,” which he said referred to flatulence, and “Devil’s Triangle,” which he said was a drinking game but which slang dictionaries describe as sex between one woman and two men. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut asked Kavanaugh if he was familiar with the Latin legal term used in common law, “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus,” meaning “false in one thing, false in everything,” but Blumenthal struggled to get traction in questioning the judge about his drinking in college. Kavanaugh repeatedly parried and interrupted, until a frustrated Blumenthal finally blurted out just as his allotted five minutes ended, “Do you believe Anita Hill?” In fact, the Democrats never seemed to regain their momentum after Grahams fussilade, and Kavanaugh’s default posture from the start was one of unmodulated outrage that he should be accused of such offenses as those alleged by Ford and at least two other named accusers. He explained his admittedly wonky habit of keeping detailed calendars of his daily activities as a teenager by saying that his father had begun the practice as a kind of running diary and he’d emulated it, almost breaking down at several points as if deeply stirred by some memory of filial piety or loyalty. He acknowledged of his teenage years, “I liked beer. I still like beer,” but denied that he had ever drunk to the point of blacking out, much less of sexually assaulting anyone, and added: “If every American who drinks beer, or every American who drank beer in high school, is suddenly presumed guilty of sexual assault, it will be an ugly new place in this country.” Repeatedly, Kavanaugh brushed away questions about his drinking by emphasizing his academic and athletic success, insisting more than once some variation on the phrase, “I busted my butt.” At one point, he told the sympathetic John Cornyn of Texas, “I’m never going to get my reputation back. My life is totally and permanently altered.” That may well be true. It seems just as likely that the judicial confirmation process, and perhaps the Supreme Court itself, have been deeply altered as well. Just as his patron the president is a Rorschach test in American politics, so too is Kavanaugh. Was his account to the committee of how his ten-year-old daughter suggested the family should pray for Ford a deeply touching note, or moment of Nixonian self-pity? Was his bitter description of his treatment by some Democrats on the committee before the latest allegations ever even arose as “an embarrassment,” a heartfelt and justified complaint, or a highly unorthodox dropping of the judiciary’s impartial mask? It all depends on who you are and what you believe. Kavanuagh’s own verdict was clear. “This is a circus,” he said. “The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades.” And if he is confirmed, of course, so might Justice Kavanaugh.","In angry, emotional testimony, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh denied sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford and denounced Democrats for engaging in a partisan conspiracy to destroy him.",2018-09-28T02:02:54Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}","Brett Kavanaugh’s Passionate, Partisan, Gale-Force Defense",https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/brett-kavanaughs-passionate-partisan-gale-force-defense/571597/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/09/RTS236GA/facebook.jpg?1538099748,,Theatlantic.com,gale,1
Amanda Kooser,"This global map of Mars shows the dust storm sweeping across the landscape. The blue dot near the center shows Opportunity's location. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS It's hard to complain about Earth weather once you realize just how crazy it can get on Mars. A dust storm larger than the continent of North America is currently plaguing the Red Planet. NASA announced on Friday the suspension of science operations for the Opportunity rover while it waits for the storm to blow over. NASA released a global map of Mars captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on June 6. It shows the growing dust storm and a blue dot indicating the rover's approximate location. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter first noticed the storm building back on June 1. The MRO team warned the Opportunity team to get ready for the blast. The storm quickly grew to cover over 7 million square miles (18 million square kilometers) and swept across Perseverance Valley where Opportunity is located. The swirling dust is impacting Opportunity's solar panels, which it uses to recharge its batteries and power the heaters that allow the rover to function in the extreme cold conditions of Mars. NASA says the dust storm's effect is ""comparable to an extremely smoggy day that blots out sunlight."" ""There is a risk to the rover if the storm persists for too long and Opportunity gets too cold while waiting for the skies to clear,"" says NASA. The Curiosity rover team is also keeping tabs on the dust storm, even though it is located in the Gale Crater on the other side of the planet. ""We expect that even if the storm dissipates before becoming a global dust storm, that the amount of dust in Gale will increase over the next several days,"" Curiosity team member Scott Guzewich wrote in an update last week. As epic as this storm is, it's still smaller than a 2007 storm that forced Opportunity to hunker down for two weeks. The rover's current suspension of activity is expected to be temporary. The long-lived machine is a survivor. It landed on Mars in 2004 for a planned 90-day mission and is still going strong all these years later.

Áine Cain,"• Facebook employees succeed if they have a drive to learn, according to VP of HR Janelle Gale. • When she's interviewing candidates, she's typically less impressed with people who already consider themselves to be the ""smartest person in the room."" • Rather, she's looking for individuals who display intellectual curiosity. Facebook employees are learners. That's why the most important trait VP of HR Janelle Gale looks for in job candidates is curiosity. ""We look for learners, people who are acquainted to learning fast, are intellectually curious, and constantly looking to expand their knowledge,"" she told Business Insider. ""They're actively seeking feedback and they're open to it."" And, as with any company, hiring the right people is crucial to helping Facebook maintain its culture. The tech company recently received a nod from Glassdoor for being the best place to work in 2018, and employees have left a slew of rave descriptions of Facebook on the job review site. Gale is also set to address how the company keeps its employees happy and engaged at Glassdoor's Best Places to Work Tour. For Gale, if displaying an interest in learning is the key to getting hired, then coming across as intellectually closed-off is a major red flag. That applies to everyone -- even top experts. ""If you've got literally the smartest person in the room, who is the top expert in whatever they're doing, and they're not opening to learning, that is a huge red flag for us,"" she said. ""We need people who are looking to incorporate new behaviors, new information, and new data, into their repertoire and skills."" Gale said that people who already think they know it all also typically overestimate themselves. ""There's just so much to learn here, no matter if you're an entry level college graduate or if you're top in your field,"" she said. ""Cockiness does not work."" So how does Facebook weed out the know-it-alls? Gale said she'll often ask follow-up questions about projects the individual has worked on, like ""What would you have done differently?"" or ""What did you learn in the process?"" ""If someone hesitates for a really long time and can't come up with an answer, or if they spin it so that what they learned actually makes them look good, that tells me that they are closed off to learning,"" she said. What she wants from the candidate is a level of vulnerability and reflection, as well as a strong demonstration of intellectual curiosity. ""I want someone to answer that question saying, 'Oh, there's a ton I learned from that' or 'Let me give you the top one, but there's so much more,'"" Gale said. ""The ability to incorporate new knowledge and information into what you're doing allows us to move faster, because you're learning faster.""

Eric Mack,"Curiosity on Mars
NASA
For the first time, scientists may have confirmed that there's methane on Mars. 
While we think of methane as the stinky gas that cows burp en masse, the presence of any molecule so frequently used and expelled by life on Earth may boost the chances that a world is habitable or perhaps even inhabited.  
A paper published in Nature Geoscience on Monday lays out the detection of methane near Gale Crater on the surface of Mars on June 16, 2013, using instruments on the Mars Express orbiter. What's important about that date is that NASA's Curiosity roverdetected methane at Gale Crater a day earlier.  
""This finding provides independent confirmation of debated measurements obtained by the Curiosity rover one day earlier,"" reads a release. 
Curiosity's previous attempts to sniff out the gas before then came up empty, and some suggested that when the rover finally did detect methane it might have been smelling its own flatulence -- the robot carries a tiny amount of methane around inside it. But the rover's operators insisted that there was no way the detection could have come from the robot itself.  
Methane has been detected in the Martian atmosphere multiple times and on the surface going all the way back to when the Viking landers sampled Martian soil in the 1970s. Viking's ""Labeled Release"" experiment appeared to have found not just methane, but signs of microbial life. Follow-up samples were inconclusive, and the claim that signs of life were discovered on Mars decades ago are now widely dismissed, although the principal investigator on the Viking experiment and others still contend they found evidence of life.  
Because it's so difficult to confirm a single methane detection on Mars using a second, independent instrument, there's still some debate over whether there really is any of the rotten-smelling biosignature on the red planet.  
""The results presented in this work not only corroborate previous detections by Curiosity but, in a broader perspective, might change our view of methane occurrence on Mars,"" the paper says. ""Our data suggest that the presence of methane on Mars might be characterized by small, short emissions and transient events."" 
The study does not address where, exactly, methane on Mars might be coming from, but it sure seems to be accusing the planet of farting. 
More seriously, the new research could allow scientists to zero in on potential sources of methane emissions on the planet's surface. That, in turn, could lead to discoveries of places that once supported life, could support it or maybe even still support it. 
And if scientists do find methane sources on Mars that are tied to signs of life, here's hoping they aren't of the silent but deadly variety.",We've been searching for signs of methane on Mars for decades now without anything definitive.

Kate Clark,"Despite a number of well-publicized hiccups, venture capitalists are betting another $500 million on health insurance provider Clover Health, TechCrunch has learned.
Existing investor Greenoaks Capital led the round, according to the startup, which confirmed it was closing a new round of capital in the coming weeks. Clover Health has raised a total of $925 million to date, garnering a valuation of $1.2 billion with a $130 million Series D funding in 2017. The company, backed by Alphabet’s venture arm GV, Sequoia Capital, Floodgate, Bracket Capital, First Round Capital and more, declined to disclose its latest valuation.
San Francisco-based Clover Health was founded in 2014 by chief executive officer Vivek Garipalli, the former founder of New Jersey healthcare system CarePoint Health; and Kris Gale, who served as the startup’s chief technology officer until transitioning into an adviser role in December 2017. As part of its latest funding round, the company told TechCrunch it’s promoting Andrew Toy, its chief technology officer since early 2018, to the role of president and CTO. He will also join its board of directors.
Varsha Rao, Airbnb’s former chief operating officer, joined the company in September 2017 as COO.
The tech-enabled health insurer differentiates itself from incumbents by collecting and analyzing health and behavioral data to lower costs and improve medical outcomes for its members. It’s part of a new cohort of heavily funded insurtech startups, including Devoted Health and Bright Health, both of which similarly provide Medicare Advantage plans. Devoted Health, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, raised a $300 million Series B funding round three months ago. Bright Health, for its part, brought in a $200 million Series C in late November at a $950 million valuation. It’s backed by Bessemer Venture Partners, Greycroft, NEA and Redpoint Ventures, among others.
Founded in 2014, Clover Health is years older than its aforementioned counterparts. The business, though supported by top-tier investors and plenty of capital, has struggled in the past to shrink its losses. In 2015, Clover Health posted a net loss of $4.9 million only to increase it 7x the following year to $34.6 million, according to financial documents obtained by Axios. At the time, Clover Health had 20,600 Medicare Advantage members, earning it $184 million in taxpayer revenue. According to reporting from CNBC, the company had initially planned to double its membership base each year but was only able to expand from 20,000 in 2016 to 27,000 in September 2017.
A source with knowledge of the matter said Clover Health currently has 40,000 members in Georgia, New Jersey, Arizona, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The business earns roughly $10,000 in revenue per member from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or currently about $400 million in annual revenue. As a Medicare Advantage plan, Clover Health makes a majority of its cash from the government.
“Clovers continuously improving economic fundamentals have allowed us to build sustainably, thoughtfully enter new markets and increase our overall membership by 35 percent during the last 12 months, compared with nationwide growth of 8 percent for Medicare Advantage overall,” the company said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “This has made Clover one of the fastest growing insurers in [Medicare Advantage] over the past three years. That said, there is much more to accomplish, which is why I am so excited about entering this next phase in our companys history.”","Despite a number of well-publicized hiccups, venture capitalists are betting another $500 million on health insurance provider Clover Health, TechCrunch has learned.",2019-01-29T16:29:08Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Alphabet-backed Medicare Advantage startup Clover Health raises $500M,http://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/alphabet-backed-medicare-advantage-startup-clover-health-raises-500m/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Clover.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,gale,1

George Dvorsky,"These photos taken by the Curiosity rover span about a couple of weeks, starting with a shot of the area before the storm appeared. GIF: NASA For the past two weeks, a massive dust storm has churned on Mars, forcing NASA to put its Opportunity rover into hibernation mode. But Curiosity, a rover on the other side of the planet, is now feeling the effects of the storm as well, revealing the dramatic, planet-size scale of this dusty weather system. The extent of this dust storm is nearly incomprehensible—about the combined size of North America and Russia. NASA says the storm now spans the entire circumference of Mars, making it a planet-encircling dust event. The Opportunity rover, which is dependent upon solar power, is (fingers crossed) only temporarily out of commission. The Curiosity rover, located about 5,000 miles (8,200) away from Opportunity, is now feeling the effects as well, with the amount of airborne dust above it doubling in the past week. The dimming created by this atmospheric haze, measured in tau, is now about 8.0 at Gale Crater, which is the highest recorded tau in the history of the Curiosity mission. At Opportunity’s location, the tau is at 11, making it really dark. But unlike Opportunity, Curiosity is in no danger of losing power, as it relies on a nuclear-powered battery. That’s not to say the storm isn’t affecting Curiosity. Because of the dim lighting, Curiosity’s cameras require extra exposure time, and extra exposure time means the optical equipment is more vulnerable to all the dust that’s blowing around. The current situation is not ideal. But Curiosity did manage to take some recent photos of the Martian landscape, revealing an increasingly dense wall of haze, which is about six to eight times thicker than usual. On Earth, planet-encircling storms aren’t really possible thanks to our thick atmosphere, stronger gravity, and plenty of vegetation cover (which binds the soil to the ground). It’s a vastly different story on Mars, as NASA explains : Martian dust storms are common, especially during southern hemisphere spring and summer, when the planet is closest to the Sun. As the atmosphere warms, winds generated by larger contrasts in surface temperature at different locations mobilize dust particles the size of individual talcum powder grains. Carbon dioxide frozen on the winter polar cap evaporates, thickening the atmosphere and increasing the surface pressure. This enhances the process by helping suspend the dust particles in the air. In some cases, the dust clouds reach up to 40 miles (60 kilometers) or more in elevation. Some storms on Mars last for a few weeks, while others go on for years. The factors that drive these variations are still not fully understood, which is why this storm, the most powerful to hit the Red Planet since 2007, is of great interest to scientists. As a neat aside, Mars isn’t the only planet to experience planet-encircling storms. Back in 2013, astronomers detected a massive thunder-and-lighting storm on Saturn that created a seamless ring around the gas giant. That’s a total distance of 190,000 miles (300,000 km), as compared to Mars, which has a circumference of 13,325 miles (21,300 km).

Alyse Stanley,"Grenade launchers, submachine guns, and laser swords are not the typical arsenal of magical girls, but, then again, Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online doesn’t bother much with convention. Without a single sailor scout uniform in sight, the spinoff series’ female characters get bloodied and dismembered in nearly every episode. Yet, for all its gruesome glory, the first, 12-episode season of SAOA: GGO, which wrapped earlier this summer on Crunchyroll, managed to become one of the most compelling, modern takes on the “magical girl” genre. [This post contains spoilers for the first season of Gun Gale Online ] What makes a magical girl anime? Many entries have similar themes, like bumbling sidekicks, glittering transformation sequences and protagonists who defeat their adversaries with the greatest power of all: talking things out. Most commonly, though, mahou shoujo (literally “magical girl” in Japanese) series feature multidimensional women suddenly bestowed with extraordinary abilities, often leading to newfound responsibilities and challenges they must overcome to grow into young ladies. It’s like puberty, if puberty had a theme song and sparkles. Nearly every magical girl anime can trace its lineage back to a single show: Bewitched. A Japanese dub of the 1960s sitcom inspired the creation of both the first magical girl manga, Himitsu no Akko-chan, and an anime, Mahotsukai Sally, later that decade. While their plots might be considered simple compared to modern examples, they pioneered a newfound focus on catering Japanese media to young girls. Many the early examples of mahou shoujo focused on coming-of-age tales and solving mundane problems with newfound powers, almost exclusively starring one of two tropes: a young, adorable witch or a young, adorable pop idol. It wouldn’t be until the ‘90s, with the release of the cult classic Sailor Moon, that the newly revitalized genre would adopt the evil-vanquishing and world-saving themes common in popular boy-focused franchises like Power Rangers. American audiences fell in love with Sailor Moon’s adventures, too. Sailor Moon Toei Animation This female quintet fighting evil by moonlight and winning love by daylight quickly become an international obsession, laying the groundwork for even more expectation-subverting spins on mahou shoujo. Some, like Cardcaptor Sakura, combined the more traditional stories of young girls with this new threat of magical foes. Other entries would fold in entirely new genres. Magic Knights Rayearth borrowed heavily from fantasy and roleplaying game elements, Puella Magi Madoka Magica proved magical girls could explore darker themes, even dipping into meta commentary. Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online brought... guns. Adapted from a best-selling light novel series, Gun Gale Online takes place several years after the events of the original Sword Art Online, where thousands of players found themselves stuck in the eponymous MMORPG, fighting for the sake of their real lives in virtual reality. In the world of the show, people cooled on the whole “virtual reality” thing following after the fiasco, though there’s a resurgence in gaming with the advent of new technology. It’s in this atmosphere that protagonist Karen Kohiruimaki first takes up VR as a hobby. Self-conscious about her height, she finds the only game that will let her have a diminutive avatar is Gun Gale Online. In a short time, she develops an aptitude for gameplay, and dumping all her skill points into speed stats gives her an edge over her opponents. She’s quickly crowned “the pink devil” for her deadly skill in the game’s first Squad Jam, a battle-royale-style competition. SAO: GGO weaves several common mahou shoujo themes into its unlikely narrative. Instead of a dazzling, stereotypical transformation sequence, Karen’s metamorphosis emphasizes the disparity between the two sides of her life, her in-game avatar acting as a projection of a “better self” in the virtual reality world. In real life, she may feel awkward, lanky and out of place, but in the game, she’s the minuscule, pink-clad Llenn, a pinnacle of magical-girl, ultra-femme aesthetics. The newfound cuteness renders her no less capable than a sailor-scout uniform would. Other women characters also adopt avatars that embody their desired attributes, like the school-age rhythm athletics club, who all opt for hulking, muscular avatars in a hilarious twist. Llenn even possesses a magic totem, a common trope among magical girls. But instead of a Sealing Wand or Moon Stick, Llenn storms into battles armed with an FN P90 submachine-gun, which she calls “P-chan” because she’s adorable. P-chan even talks to her on several occasions, offering encouragement and ultimately saving her from taking a bullet. Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online Aniplex of America The viability of girl-on-girl teamwork popularized by the quintets of Sailor Moon and later series like Tokyo Mew Mew also plays a key role in SAO: GGO, acting as the major plot-driver throughout the series. While the first Squad Jam sees Llenn paired solely with a male teammate, the game’s second battle royale has her playing alongside her real-world best friend, Miya Shinoharah. Playing under the name Fukaziroh, her dual-wielding grenade launchers make the perfect complement to Llenn’s speedy, up-close combat. At first, Llenn squirrels away valuable time debating tactics in her head and ignoring her friend, until a careless step into an enemy trap injures Fukaziroh and the two are forced to regroup under fire. With an enemy team threatening them, the two realize that only through combining their opposing styles of fighting can they hope to survive and eventually fight Llenn’s online friend Pitohui, the only reason they chose to participate in the first place. Fukaziroh isn’t the only ally Llenn convinces to join her side. After defeating the aforementioned school girls in the game’s first Squad Jam, Llenn crosses paths with them in the second competition while pushing towards Pitohui’s location, and they vow to assist her. Unlike typical mahou shoujo, this show of support sees no mercy from the enemy, and Llenn’s new in-game friends are sniped, combusted, tortured, and ultimately killed by their adversaries. “Talking things out” is not an option in Gun Gale Online, a nd the final battle between Llenn and Pitohui is anything but glorious, descending into a vicious grudge match that Llenn only wins by the skin of her teeth, literally, using them to tear into Pitohui’s jugular as gushing blood stains them both. The end of a friendship? Not in the least. In what is arguably the most compelling display of female solidarity I’ve ever seen, the series ends on a moment of the two VR warriors palling around in-game as if nothing’s changed. It’s “girl power” at its finest, given the modern twist so many other magical girl animes lack, their roots steeped in tradition. With its transformations, focus on teamwork, and well-rounded female characters, unbeholden both to society’s conception of femininity and their violent avatars alike, Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online upholds core tenants of mahou shoujo while breaking new ground. The series posits, through gunplay action, that media featuring strong women doesn’t have to be beholden to a particular theme or look, that this entertainment should be as varied as the women watching it. And ultimately, it challenges the genre at large, planting its stake in the ground and asking: Where can it go next?

Alastair Gale,"TOKYO--The head of a Japanese doomsday cult responsible for deadly gas attacks in the 1990s was executed on Friday, public broadcaster NHK reported. Chizuo Matsumoto, also known as Shoko Asahara, had been on death row since 2004. During morning rush hour on March 20, 1995, members of the doomsday cult he led, Aum Shinrikyo, punctured plastic bags with sarin nerve gas on three Tokyo subway lines, killing 13 people and injuring 6,300. Matsumoto was one of 13 cult members sentenced to hang for their part in the attack. An earlier sarin gas attack by the cult in central Japan in 1994 killed seven people. Matsumoto lost his final appeal to overturn his death sentence in September 2006. A spokesman for Japan’s Justice Ministry declined to comment.

Petrana Radulovic,"Asking why people play video games is like asking why they watch TV, or why they eat pizza: You might be able to identify a few clusters of motivation (its funny when Sheldon says bazinga on The Big Bang Theory ; hot cheese and pepperoni are comforting), but any given explanation wont get too deep. Why do people do anything ? To escape their lives? To join a community of like-minded people that isnt available to them in person? Because its cool to blow things up?.hack//SIGN, a one-season anime series from 2003 thats finally streaming on Crunchyroll and Hulu, takes a serious stab at answering these questions, and manages to address the full constellation of reasons people play games largely by ignoring actual gameplay. The series has some American fans. hack//SIGN briefly appeared on Toonamis lineup the year of its debut but, at least anecdotally, it doesnt seem like the show has had the staying power I would have expected. I was 10 when it aired, obsessed with RuneScape and deeply invested in pretending to be an adult man on Dragonlance forums, and although rewatching the series a few months back felt like one, long, grim retreat to my adolescent self, it also felt like hindsight, a rare experience of seeing a piece of art ask questions in ways that were ahead of its time. Given the centrality of.hack//SIGN s subjects to the miasma of modern American life our obligations to people in online spaces, how to cope with seemingly unending anxiety and depression, resisting the creep of authority I think its about time it had a comeback..hack//SIGN takes place almost entirely in The World, an enormously popular MMO in the shows version of the then-future year 2009. The World has a surreal fantasy setting, dotted with impossible cliffs, angled balloons that look like they should be blowing in the wind but never move, and adorable, existentially stricken creatures called Gruntys. In theory, The World is the site of cool monster combat, dungeon-crawling and maybe some epic magic. (And in some media it is; the.hack franchise grew to encompass another anime series, manga, and a series of games putting real players in the role of players in The World.) But.hack//SIGN features almost none of these things instead, the vast majority of the show is just characters talking about their feelings. And its great. Bee Train At the beginning of the series, Tsukasa, a Wavemaster ( The World s name for wizards), wakes up and realizes he is unable to log out. Later on, he discovers that he is not only trapped in The World, hes become part of the game: He can feel it when he runs his hands through the grass, he can tenderly pick up and observe the bugs in the digital world, and most importantly, he experiences real pain when he gets hit. The rest of the characters among them a brash teen girl brawler named Mimiru, an elder swordsman named Bear and a quiet knight named Subaru come together around Tsukasa, taking interest in the cause of his plight and what, if anything, any of them can do about it. The trapped in an online world genre was heavily developed with its own set of tropes even before it became the default state for most of our lives. Theres everything from Tron to Ready Player One, while Sword Art Online, a light novel and anime series, has taken it as the foundation of an ongoing franchise. (Though the first arc features the characters stuck in a fantasy game superficially similar to The World, the franchise has branched out Sword Art Online 2 takes place in a game that is literally called Gun Gale Online.) Even the rest of.hack properties solely focus on people playing the game. Fully embodying your role-playing character is a long-standing fantasy, and most works in the stuck in internet genre largely act as wish fulfillment. When they acknowledge the limitations of characters lives outside of games, they use it as a way to affirm that the game is, in fact, where the character is really alive..hack//SIGN takes the opposite approach, suggesting that its cast of misfit characters are continuing to live their lives with all of the attendant anxieties, complexes and traumas in the game. On one level, Tsukasa being stuck in The World is a simple enough story hook: Why is he trapped there, will he escape, and how can the other characters help? But logging out becomes a potent metaphor, one that is slowly imbued with more and more emotional baggage as we learn more about the real person behind the character. We learn that Tsukasas mother is largely absent; we learn that he has suffered long-term abuse at the hands of his father; we learn that he is, in all likelihood, a girl, facts that he himself does not remember until late in the series. (One reading of.hack//SIGN could posit the show as an understated coming-out narrative.) The fantastic setting of The World, desolate as it is sometimes, becomes a far more understandable form of escape, as MMOs are for all sorts of awkward and isolated kids. Bee Train Even the seemingly fun parts of The World become arenas for interpersonal conflict, rather than pyrotechnics. The characters answer riddles as part of dungeon-crawling missions rather than fighting, use sword swings as places to emphatically express their problems, and take dying in the game even temporarily as a deadly serious matter. During these scenes, theres very little dynamism in the direction; most of.hack//SIGN stays squarely in the two-shot space, with static shots of characters staring at each other. When the series villain finally confronts the protagonists, its in the form of their worst fears about how other people see them. Theres tons of anime precedent for this degree of internal conflict eliding seemingly bombastic external features (the creative team on.hack//SIGN included alumni of Ghost in the Shell and Neon Genesis Evangelion ), but literalizing this tension in the form of The World allows.hack//SIGN to even more directly explore this tonal tension. To be sure, there are lots of aspects of.hack//SIGN that feel almost quaint: The relationship players have to the idea of their characters dying, the near-taboo against looking up information about other players outside of The World, the almost-total lack of knowledge about the version histories of the game and who made it. Still, the question.hack//SIGN asks continues to resonate, between all forms of escapist media and online interaction: If we play games in part to escape our relationships in the real world, at what point do the people we play with become more important, and when do we become obligated to them? What is worth logging out for? The answer, it turns out, is lesbian romance. Subaru and Tsukasas connection becomes the core of the show, founded as it is on their shared recognition of each others trauma and difficult life experiences. (Where Tsukasa is the victim of abuse, Subaru suffers from serious health problems and is paraplegic, playing The World as a way to experience motion.) Once Tsukasa has begun the hard work of processing whats happened to him and once Subaru has confirmed that she is interested in the real Tsukasa, independent of his gender they agree to see each other in the real world. Once Tsukasa has logged out, they pass each other on a quiet street, and An (the player behind Tsukasa) says, simply, Im home..hack//SIGN doesnt delve into what it means for Tsukasa to be home, but its hard not to believe that the statement would be true wherever they were together, even if they were lost in The World. Eric Thurm is the founder, host, and overall doofus behind Drunk Education, which started as a party at his house that several people had to be tricked into attending. He is also a writer whose work has appeared in GQ, Esquire, Rolling Stone, The A.V. Club and other publications, and the author of a book on board games forthcoming from NYU Press in 2019.","How deep are the relationships we form in an MMO? .hack//SIGN, which ran on Toonami in 2003 and has finally made its way to Crunchyroll and Hulu, tackles the subject of video games and second lives with total nuance.

Jeffry Bartash,"The U.S. economy keeps sailing along even as headwinds pick up. The economy is fighting more gale winds now compared to half a year ago, but it just keeps sailing ahead. Rising interest rates are one obstacle. So are higher gas prices. Then there’s all the angst sowed by the Trump administration’s aggressive trade policies and threats of tariffs. Read: Mortgage rates reach seven-year high in a housing market reckoning A seemingly bumpier economic landscape, however, has failed to slow the U.S. Economists polled by MarketWatch predict growth will speed up to 3.2% in the second quarter running from April to June. The U.S. expanded at a mild 2.3% pace in the first three months of 2018. Already, we’ve seen signs of a spring revival. Retail sales rose in April for the second straight month and a pair of regional surveys of American manufacturers have shown fresh strength. Companies in an area stretching from southern New Jersey to western Pennsylvania, for example, reported the biggest increase in new orders in 45 years. “Following an extremely brief respite — probably on the back of trade tensions — the manufacturing space seems to be accelerating once again,” said Tom Porcelli of RBC Capital Markets. For further proof investors will look toward Friday’s report on orders for durable goods — products such as new cars, appliances or computers meant to last at least three years. These orders have climbed a healthy 11% over the past year. Businesses have also sharply increased investment in the same span. Firms are investing more because demand for their goods and services keep rising. The U.S. economy is running close to full tilt, with unemployment dropping below 4% for the first time since 2000 and job openings at a record high. The strong jobs market have given Americans the money and, just as important, the confidence to spend. An ultra-tight labor market is also helping in another way. Since good help has gotten almost impossible to find, companies are very reluctant to reduce staff whenever they encounter even a brief slowdown in sales. Those employment reductions can often feed on themselves and hurt the broader economy. “Firms are scared to let people go because they know how hard it has become to find qualified people to hire,” noted chief U.S. economist Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. The shockingly small rate of layoffs in the U.S. underscores the point. The number of people collecting unemployment benefits is at a 45-year low and shows no sign of rising. The good times can’t be taken for granted, of course. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.45%, for instance, broke clean through the 3% mark last week for the first time since 2011. Many consumer and business loans are tied to that rate. Gas prices have also surged above $3 a gallon in many parts of the country and are likely headed higher through the summer. That’s likely to fuel inflation. Read: Here’s how much $3-per-gallon gas will offset the tax cuts The economies of Japan and Europe, meanwhile, sputtered in early 2018, and if growth doesn’t rebound soon it could limit demand for U.S. exports. Enough to sidetrack a U.S. economy that’s now been growing for almost nine years?

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Tropical Storm Michael is bringing damaging winds and life-threatening flash flooding over portions of North Carolina and Virginia before heading off into the Atlantic Ocean, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Thursday. The center of Michael will bring gale- to storm-force winds over portions of southeastern Virginia, extreme northeastern North Carolina, and the Delmarva Peninsula late on Thursday night and on Friday morning when it becomes post-tropical off the Mid-Atlantic coast, the Miami-based weather forecaster said. Michael, the third most powerful hurricane ever to hit the U.S. mainland, smashed into Florida’s northwest coast near the small town of Mexico Beach on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with 155-mile-per-hour (250-kilometer-per-hour) winds. It left at least 7 dead and tore apart coastal towns. By 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) on Thursday, the storm was located about 5 miles (10 km) northwest of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, with maximum sustained winds of 50 miles-per-hour (85 kph). Reporting by K.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The Carr fire has burned through an area larger than the city of San Francisco California's deadliest current wildfire is getting larger, officials warn, despite thousands of firefighters battling it. ""Erratic winds"" and dry conditions have caused the Carr fire to grow early on Sunday, firefighters said. It is one of eight major wildfires currently burning in the state. The fire, in the Shasta County in northern California, has killed six people so far, including two children and their great-grandmother. Melody Bledsoe, 70, Emily Roberts, five, and James Roberts, four, died when they were caught in its path as they were about to evacuate their home in the town of Redding, about 150 miles (240km) north of Sacramento, on Thursday. A fourth body was found on Sunday. Two firefighters also lost their lives on Thursday. A third firefighter died battling the Ferguson fire, near Yosemite, earlier this month. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years The Carr fire, which doubled in size overnight on Friday, was only 5% contained by Sunday morning. It has already burnt more than 48,000 acres (194 sq km) of land and destroyed at least 500 structures. It began on Monday. On Thursday it became a firestorm, jumping across the Sacramento River, according to news agency Reuters. California department of forestry and fire protection (CalFire) chief Ken Pimlott told reporters they were ""seeing fire whirls - literally what can be described as a tornado"". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are 12,000 firefighters working to contain blazes across California ""This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity"" by gale-force winds, he said, ""uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways"". A total of 38,000 people have been evacuated from Shasta County. California's Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in the area, as well as three others. US President Donald Trump has approved federal aid for the counties. The Carr is the largest of eight big fires burning in California, and 90 across the country, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. There are currently 12,000 firefighters battling the flames across the state. Wildfires are a common occurrence in California during the state's long, hot, dry summers. However, experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain told the Los Angeles Times much of the state's vegetation had reached ""explosively dry"" levels. In December, Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"", and that large fires ""could happen every year or every few years"".

Amanda Kooser,"The rough and rocky landscape of Mars continues to take a toll on the wheels of NASA's Curiosity rover. As part of a routine checkup, Curiosity snapped some new images of its wheels this week. 
Most of the photos don't look too alarming, but one in particular shows some dramatic holes and cracks in the aluminum. 
The Mars rocks are giving Curiosity's wheels a hard time.
NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS
NASA has been monitoring Curiosity's wheel damage for years, watching it increase from dents to holes to actual cracks in some of the raised treads. Images from early 2017 delivered the first evidence of the tread breakage, with the left-middle wheel showing the most stress.
The car-size Curiosity rolls around on six wheels. NASA has already implemented measures designed to protect them, including a software update that adjusts the speed of the rover's wheels to reduce pressure from rocks. 
NASA said in 2017 that it fully expects the wheels to last for the life of the mission. The rover has traversed over 12 miles (19 kilometers) across Mars since landing in 2012.
The Curiosity team is preparing to take another look at the wheels after the rover takes a short drive in Gale Crater as it continues its studies of the Mount Sharp area.

Mike Wall,"We may be one step closer to cracking the Mars methane mystery.
NASA's Curiosity rover mission recently determined that background levels of methane in Mars' atmosphere cycle seasonally, peaking in the northern summer. The six-wheeled robot has also detected two surges
 to date of the gas inside the Red Planet's 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater — once in June 2013, and then again in late 2013 through early 2014.
These finds have intrigued astrobiologists, because methane is a possible biosignature. Though the gas can be produced by a variety of geological processes, the vast majority of methane in Earth's air is pumped out by microbes and other living creatures.
Related: The Search for Life on Mars: A Photo Timeline
Some answers may soon be on the horizon, because that June 2013 detection has just been firmed up. Europe's Mars Express orbiter
 noted the spike as well from that spacecraft's perch high above the Red Planet, a new study reports.
""While previous observations, including that of Curiosity, have been debated, this first independent confirmation of a methane spike increases confidence in the detections,"" said study lead author Marco Giuranna, of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Rome.
And that's not all. Giuranna and his team also traced the likely source of the June 2013 plume to a geologically complex region about 310 miles (500 kilometers) east of Gale Crater.
Whiffs of Gale Crater air
The researchers used data gathered by Mars Express' Planetary Fourier Spectrometer instrument (PFS), which also sniffed out traces of Red Planet methane back in 2004. (The spacecraft has been orbiting Mars since December 2003.)
Giuranna, the PFS principal investigator, had prepared for synergy with the Curiosity team. Soon after the rover's August 2012 touchdown inside Gale, he decided to monitor the air above the crater over the long term, Giuranna said.
It's tricky to measure Red Planet methane from Mars orbit, for a variety of reasons, including the gas's low abundance and weak absorption. (It's no picnic measuring Mars methane from Earth, either, because the much more plentiful methane in our planet's atmosphere can complicate observations and interpretations. These factors help explain the debate Giuranna referenced above.) 
So, Giuranna and his colleagues developed a new approach to PFS data selection, processing and analysis. For the new study, they applied this approach to measurements made over Gale Crater during the first 20 months of Curiosity's mission on Mars.
They found one hit: a peak of about 15.5 parts per billion (ppb) methane by volume on June 16, 2013. That was just one Martian day after Curiosity detected a peak of nearly 6 ppb.
""We were very lucky, as this is not the result of coordinated observations,"" Giuranna told Space.com via email. ""Just by chance!""
By the way, background methane levels in Gale Crater's air, as measured by Curiosity, range from about 0.24 ppb to 0.65 ppb.
Related: Photos: Red Planet Views from Europe's Mars Express
Tracing the source
The study team also homed in on the methane plume's possible source region, using two independent approaches.
The researchers divided the area around Gale Crater into a series of squares, each of which measured nearly 155 miles (250 km) on a side. They then used computer simulations to create 1 million methane-release scenarios for every square, to assess the probability of each one as a source for the Gale gas. The scientists also studied the geology of each square, looking for features that might be associated with methane emission, such as fault lines and fault intersections.
""Remarkably, we saw that the atmospheric simulation and geological assessment, performed independently of each other, suggested the same region of provenance of the methane, which is situated about 500 km east of Gale,"" Giuranna said. ""This is very exciting and largely unexpected.""
That potential source region may contain methane trapped beneath ice, he added.
""That methane could be released episodically along faults that break through the permafrost due to partial melting of ice, gas pressure buildup induced by gas accumulation during migration, or stresses due to planetary adjustments or local meteorite impact,"" the researchers wrote in the new study, which was published online today (April 1) in the journal Nature Geoscience
.
Still lots of work to do
The paper doesn't address the ultimate origin of the methane — whether it was churned out by Martian microbes or reactions involving hot water and certain types of rock. And scientists don't know if the detected methane was produced recently or long ago; it could have been trapped under the ice for eons, after all.
But the new study could help researchers get to the bottom of such questions eventually. For example, Mars Express will eye the potential source region in detail in the future, Giuranna said. And other spacecraft, such as the methane-sniffing Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) — part of the European-Russian ExoMars program — may do so as well.
Indeed, Giuranna's team is involved with the TGO mission, which arrived at Mars in October 2016. And coordinated TGO-Mars Express measurements are in the works. The PFS team also aims to apply its new analysis techniques to the instrument's entire data set, Giuranna said.
""Follow-up is very important to better understand methane on Mars,"" he said. ""We are collecting pieces of a puzzle and need more pieces to understand better what is going on.""

Catie Keck,"NASA has had quite a bit on its plate recently between its Hubble Space Telescope entering safe mode, the prolonged silence from its Opportunity rover, and a technical issue with its Curiosity rover on Mars. But one bright spot appears to be the return of some science operations by Curiosity following a memory anomaly last month. While its not totally back up to full operations, Curiosity will be able to transmit data to its team while they work on its recovery. Sharing the news in an enthusiastic post on NASAs website on Friday, the Curiosity team announced that it had made progress on diagnosing an anomaly that occurred in mid-September. After its engineers switched the rover back to its A-side computer, the Mars explorer was able to send back an image of the Martian surface at Vera Rubin Ridge utilizing a camera it hasnt used since 2013. Thanks to our hard-working engineers, Curiosity is ready for limited science operations while the anomaly work continues, NASA said. Curiosity, which explores the planets Gale crater, is currently using its A-side computer until the team is able to determine the cause of its glitch. The rover swapped to the B-side of its two redundant computers after its A-side became corrupted back in 2013, about 200 days into its mission. Earlier this month, engineers at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory commanded the rover to switch brains in order to allow the Curiosity team to do a full diagnosis of the issue that had been affecting its memory since September 15. We spent the last week checking out Side A and preparing it for the swap, Steven Lee, Curiositys deputy project manager, said in a statement at the time. Its certainly possible to run the mission on the Side-A computer if we really need to. But our plan is to switch back to Side B as soon as we can fix the problem to utilize its larger memory size. The car-sized Martian rover was launch in 2012 as part of NASAs Mars Science Laboratory mission. It had a busy couple of months just before its glitch, taking a Martian selfie in September and finding 3.5-billion-year-old organic compounds in June. Earlier this year, it captured a stunning panorama of Mars from the top of Vera Rubin Ridge. Answering questions from its followers on Twitter, the Curiosity team also tweeted Wednesday that there is currently no update on the Opportunity rover (or Oppy, to which its often affectionately referred), which powered down in June in Mars Perseverance Valley after getting swept up in a massive dust storm that may have blocked its solar panels with dust. In response to questions about Opportunitys status, the Curiosity team pointed to the Red Planets upcoming windy season as a potential fix, as NASA said last week it hopes the wind may be able to clear the dust from its panels to help it get charged and back up and running, if that is indeed the issue.","NASA has had quite a bit on its plate recently between its Hubble Space Telescope entering safe mode, the prolonged silence from its Opportunity rover, and a technical issue with its Curiosity rover on Mars.

Amanda Kooser,"This Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter image shows the Jezero Crater delta region. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/JHU-APL A fascinating new Mars frontier awaits NASA's next red planet rover. The space agency announced its choice for the Mars 2020 mission landing site Monday and it's quite a crater. Jezero Crater beat out two other top candidates to win the rover jackpot. ""The landing site in Jezero Crater offers geologically rich terrain, with landforms reaching as far back as 3.6 billion years old, that could potentially answer important questions in planetary evolution and astrobiology,"" says NASA's Thomas Zurbuchen. Mars 2020 project scientist Ken Farley says, ""The Mars community has long coveted the scientific value of sites such as Jezero Crater."" The crater sits just north of the planet's equator and once featured a river delta. This makes it a prime spot for preserving possible signs of ancient microbial life. NASA had contemplated sending a previous mission to the crater, but had to wait for improvements in landing technology to deliver the rover safely into the area's challenging terrain. NASA says it's been able to reduce the Mars 2020 landing zone to an area 50 percent smaller than the one needed for the Curiosity rover in Gale Crater in 2012. Mars 2020 is scheduled to launch in July 2020. It'll look for signs of habitable conditions from the planet's ancient past, but also collect and store surface samples with the hope that a future mission will be able to retrieve the cache and bring it back to Earth.","Congratulations, Jezero Crater!",2018-11-19T18:55:14Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",NASA picks 'coveted' landing site for Mars 2020 rover - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-picks-coveted-landing-site-for-mars-2020-rover/,https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/XXk48gi6IiaVFZevJDzo4edyErg=/724x407/2018/11/19/9e0cd934-05db-44f7-be29-25b290575695/jezerocrater.jpg,,Cnet.com,gale,1
Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"When it comes to landing a robot on another planet, perhaps the most important question is where to put the dang thing. The researchers behind the upcoming ExoMars mission, consisting of a rover and lander, have now announced their preferred location on the Red Planet. After several years of discussion, the scientists selected Oxia Planum as the optimal site, according to an announcement a meeting at the National Space Centre in Leicester, UK. Though subject to further review, this location could be a prime spot to determine whether life ever existed on Mars. We can fulfill the mission objectives there and the trafficability is very goodthe rover will be able to drive, Veronique Dehant, principle investigator on the surface platforms Lander radio-science experiment from the Royal Observatory Belgium, told Gizmodo. ExoMars 2020 is the next part of the ExoMars missions: a rover and landing platform that will be sent to Mars as part of a joint mission between the European Space Agency and Russias Roscosmos. The rover and platform consist of instruments for measuring the planets dirt and atmosphere, and will separate just before landing. The missions main goal is to find evidence of organic molecules deep in the Martian dirt, and perhaps biosignatures, chemical signs of life. Given that Mars has about as much land as the Earth does above water, picking a site has been a long process, according to an ESA fact sheet. Such a site must be interesting scientifically, with signs of a wet past. It must also be in a low-lying area to maximize the amount of atmosphere available, in order to slow down the descending payload with its rockets and parachutes. And it has to be flat enough to land safely and for a rover to navigate. Oxia Planum sits just north of Mars equator. Channels cutting through its clay are signs of past waterways and a potential reservoir of organic molecules. The selection follows a five-year process that began with an organized working group, then a call for nominations. The team narrowed their options to two sites, Oxia Planum and Mawrth Vallis further north. While both were interesting scientifically and the Mawrth Vallis had slightly more diverse geology, Oxia Planum won, being the more navigable site at a lower elevation. Mission scientists cant pinpoint an exact location for the landinginstead, they create an ellipse which serves as a target for the landing components. The ellipse is relatively obstacle free, spare one crater in its corner, and is approximately the size of Rhode Island. The odds of landing in the one crater are relatively slim, said Dehant. Theres more to a successful landing than just picking a good spot, of coursethe descent needs to go as planned. Back in 2016, the ExoMars Schiaparell lander crashed due to an error in its onboard computer. Picking a landing site determines what kind of science a rover might be expected to conduct. Oxia Planum isnt much different from Gale Crater, the presumed ancient lakebed that is currently home to NASAs Curiosity rover, in terms of the kind of scientific discovery it offers, Dehant explained to Gizmodo. But she hopes that Oxia Planum will be a fruitful place to search for biosignatures. The rovers experiments wont only look at the dirt, thoughthere will be a suite of instruments to study the planets climate and atmosphere. After all, not only have recent results from Curiosity found organic molecules on the planet, but also a strange seasonal variation to its atmospheric methane. Scientists interested in the Martian atmosphere perhaps have fewer requirements for where the mission lands. They just need the experiment to arrive in working order. As long as its safe, Francesca Ferri, principal investigator of the Atmospheric Mars Entry and Landing Investigation and Analysis experiment as part of ExoMars 2016, told Gizmodo.

Amanda Kooser,"NASA shared Curiosity's dusty selfie on June 20. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Mars is a bit of a mess right now. The Red Planet is in the middle of a global dust storm that has forced one Mars rover into hibernation and left another working through hazy conditions. The storm kicked up in late May. Scott Guzewich, a member of the Curiosity rover team, posted a mission update to a NASA blog on Friday noting a slow decline over the last two weeks in the amount of dust seen over Gale Crater. He says ""it's possible the dust storm has reached its 'peak.'"" ""We may now be entering (or soon entering) the period where the massive amount of dust in the atmosphere will slowly settle out and Mars' shrouded surface may once again be clearly visible from space,"" says Guzewich. While Curiosity is busy with its science studies, the Opportunity rover on the other side of the planet is still out of touch with home. The Opportunity team says it continues to listen for contact from the quiet rover every day. It last touched base on June 10. NASA hopes Opportunity will wake from its sleep when the skies clear and the solar panels are able to recharge its batteries. The rover launched in 2003 for a 90-day mission and has exceeded expectations by continuing its science observations well over a decade later.

Murata teased the manga back in 2016, but officially announced it at the Ready Player One celebration event in Tokyo. According to Anime Network News, the manga will be based on the original 1985 movie, with story content that wasn’t seen in the original film. However, it might not be limited to just the first film, as you can see Biff Tannen descendent Griff and Doc Brown’s 19th-century love interest Clara in the preview image, along with Marty’s famous hoverboard, even though they’re all from the sequels. Murata added that the biggest challenge is drawing Michael J. Fox in his role as Marty McFly, calling it an “extremely high hurdle” to overcome. But based on the first look, seems like he’s already creating something special. The manga will start serializing on the Kono Manga’s site sometime in the next couple of months, with a compiled book volume being released in Japan on April 20.

"USA TODAY Sports, Nancy Armour and Rachel Axon, USA TODAY Sports","A USA TODAY Sports investigation found that banned coaches have been taking advantage of gaping holes in a child-protection system the U.S. Olympic Committee has vowed for years to fix. USA TODAY Gerald Murphy leads a kickboxing class on Nov. 13, 2007. (Photo: Rob Davis/For the Democrat, Tallahassee Democrat) The U.S. Center for SafeSport has suspended a taekwondo coach who helped her husband evade a lifetime ban for sexual misconduct by taking formal ownership of their gym and representing their club at meets sanctioned by USA Taekwondo. USA TODAY reported last week that Gerald Murphy continued coaching at the same gym in Tallahassee, Fla., even after USA Taekwondo banned him in early 2014. He did that with the help of Gale Murphy, his wife and another coach at the school. The center issued an interim suspension for her on Monday for allegations of misconduct. In a statement, SafeSport spokesman Dan Hill said, “We don’t comment on specific matters but we do take the SafeSport Code seriously. Sport needs a radical culture shift to make athlete well-being its centerpiece; it won’t happen until every person, from home to gym, owns their role and champions respect.” Gale Murphy did not immediately return a voicemail from USA TODAY early Monday afternoon. Gerald Murphy, 64, was convicted in Florida in 1989 of lewd and lascivious assault of a child after being found in bed with a 14-year-old who babysat his children. Murphy spent 18 months in prison after failing to meet the conditions of his sentencing. USA Taekwondo learned of Murphy’s prior conviction in 2014 from Ronda Sweet, a former USA Taekwondo board chairwoman. The national governing body banned Murphy on April 3, 2014. A USA TODAY investigation found Murphy has been coaching at the same gym since he was banned. Related: Was your child’s coach banned for sexual misconduct? Better check “Do I coach at the school? Yeah, I am the teacher and owner,” Murphy told a USA TODAY reporter in August. Four days after Murphy was banned, Gale Murphy incorporated the Dragon System Institute of Martial Arts.

His wife and son are USA Taekwondo members, Murphy said, and coach the school’s athletes at events sanctioned by national governing bodies. The club was still listed as a member on USA Taekwondo’s website as of Nov. 21. It’s not clear in whose name the club was registered with the governing body.

The Conversation,"The discovery of life on Mars would get pretty much everyone excited. But the scientists hunting for it would probably be happy no matter what the outcome of their search whether life turned out to extinct, dormant or extant. Theyd even consider finding no evidence of life whatsoever to be an important discovery. But, as the saying goes, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and it will take many decades of detailed exploration of Mars to be reasonably sure that life has always been absent there.
There have been no direct observations of living organisms or fossils on Mars so far. But there are other types of evidence. One of the most often cited is the controversial detection of methane in the planets atmosphere, first in 2004 and then in 2014. This could have been produced by some kind of past or present microbial lifeform. However, the abundance is so low that the data remain uncertain. And in 2018, the team behind the European Space Agencys Trace Gas Orbiter said they had failed to discover any methane.
Now a new paper, published in Nature Geoscience, reports a fresh detection of methane in the planets atmosphere, along with a theory of where it came from. But given how difficult it is to make reliable measurements of this gas, how confident can we be about the results?
The new research used archived data acquired between 2012 and 2014 by the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer aboard Mars Express, which studies the composition of the planets atmosphere through the infrared radiation that is reflected and emitted by the planet. This is the same instrument that first detected low levels of methane in Mars atmosphere in 2004.
The difference between the two sets of observations comes from the mode in which the spectrometer operated. In 2004, the data were acquired by the instrument looking through the atmosphere to the surface as Mars Express orbited the planet. In the new study, the instrument was pointed at a single surface feature, and tracked the feature as the spacecraft orbited.

The significance of the data arises from the feature that the team selected to track: the Gale Crater. This, of course, is the site where the Curiosity rover is operating and where the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on board Curiosity detected elevated levels of methane in 2014.
The spectrometer on Mars Express was tracking the Gale Crater before, during and after Curiositys detection. Excitingly, it also detected elevated levels of methane in the region the first time that a simultaneous detection of methane at the surface and in the atmosphere has occurred. This, perhaps, makes the new measurement more reliable than the previous detections.
The researchers also attempted to pinpoint the source of methane using a grid-mapping technique. They created computer models of emission scenarios in each grid and also looked at geological features in each place to see if there were potential sources of methane. They inferred that the methane was released from a region to the east of Gale Crater and that the most likely origin of the gas was seepage of along faults in ice beneath the surface.
Finding where the methane came from is only a stage in determining how it formed. Importantly, there are many mechanisms other than living organisms that could have produced it, for example geological processes. For example, a geological event may have fractured the ice containing bubbles of methane to release it into the atmosphere.
But the new study does not attempt to make any conclusions about the origin of the methane. However, the authors do comment that their findings, especially in corroborating the Curiosity data, suggest that the methane release is more likely to be by small, short events, rather than episodic large exhalations. Indeed, it could be speculated that small events are more likely than large ones if Mars turns out to experience the marsquakes (similar to an earthquake) that the Insight mission is programmed to detect.
So whatever the source, it does seem there may be methane on Mars after all. However, well need further confirmation to be completely sure. Fortunately, fresh findings are most likely to be available soon. The team that failed to discover methane with the Trace Gas Orbiter has been analyzing new data for several months.
As it has an extremely sensitive detector for methane on board, it is anticipated that continued data collection over the next few years will give a much better picture on whether there is a seasonal, or an episodic variation in atmospheric methane. Or it could reveal that it is just an illusory will-o-the-wisp.

msmash,"The robot, developed by MIT engineers, is equipped with a soft-pronged gripper, a force-sensing wrist cuff, and an external camera, all of which it uses to see and feel the tower and its individual blocks. As the robot carefully pushes against a block, a computer takes in visual and tactile feedback from its camera and cuff, and compares these measurements to moves that the robot previously made. It also considers the outcomes of those moves -- specifically, whether a block, in a certain configuration and pushed with a certain amount of force, was successfully extracted or not. In real-time, the robot then ""learns"" whether to keep pushing or move to a new block, in order to keep the tower from falling. Details of the Jenga-playing robot are published in the journal Science Robotics. Alberto Rodriguez, the Walter Henry Gale Career Development Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT, says the robot demonstrates something that's been tricky to attain in previous systems: the ability to quickly learn the best way to carry out a task, not just from visual cues, as it is commonly studied today, but also from tactile, physical interactions.","In the basement of MIT's Building 3, a robot is carefully contemplating its next move.

BeauHD,"""We can start to see that Mars didn't just have one wet period early in its history and then dried out,"" study lead author Edwin Kite, an assistant professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago, told Space.com. ""It's more complicated than that; there were multiple wet periods."" The team's work suggests that Martian rivers flowed intermittently but intensely over much of the planet's 4.5-billion-year history, driven by precipitation-fed runoff. The rivers' impressive width -- in many cases, more than twice that of comparable Earth catchments -- is a testament to that intensity.
It's unclear how much water Martian rivers carried, because their depth is hard to estimate. Determining depth generally requires up-close analysis of riverbed rocks and pebbles, Kite said, and such work has only been done in a few locations on Mars, such as Gale Crater, which NASA's Curiosity rover has been exploring since 2012. The ancient Mars rivers didn't flow in just a few favored spots; rather, they were distributed widely around the planet, Kite and his colleagues found.","A new study suggests that Mars once had giant rivers larger than anything on Earth after the planet lost most of its atmosphere to space.

 Two of the main opposing stories have featured that of a survivor (Carol) and an abuser (Alpha). On last Sunday's episode, Henry recalled Carol had grown her hair out because she felt safe for the first time in years. She used to keep her hair relatively short because her ex would grab it to slam her against the wall. At the same time, viewers received a backstory about the mysterious Alpha who killed her husband in cold blood and was abusive to her daughter, Lydia. 
 Is the show setting up a showdown between the two? 
 ""Well, I'd certainly love to see one,"" Gale Ann Hurd recently said on ""Talking Dead"" when asked if the show is hinting at bringing the two together. ""They are both incredibly resourceful, and Carol will do anything for her group, as we've seen in the past.""

""For me, it's the best conditions possible,"" Kawauchi said with a wide smile through an interpreter. On the fifth anniversary of the finish line explosions that killed three and wounded hundreds more, Linden and Kawauchi led a field of 30,000 runners through a drenching rain, temperatures in the mid-30s and gusts of up to 32 mph on the 26.2-mile trek from Hopkinton.

Linden, a California native who lives in Michigan, nearly ended the drought in 2011 when she was outkicked down Boylston Street and finished second by 2 seconds during yet another Kenyan sweep. But the East Africans who have dominated the professional era of the race had their worst performance in decades. Kirui was the only Kenyan in the top ten for the men's race; defending champion Edna Kiplagat, who was ninth, helped prevent a shutout in the distaff division.

Beth Elderkin,"They who control the spice control the game. In anticipation of Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Dune, Legendary Entertainment and Frank Herbert’s estate (under the company name Herbert Properties LLC) have announced they’ve teamed up with Gale Force Nine to produce a series of board games set in the Dune universe. The first one, a tabletop role-playing game, is set to come out next year. According to a press release, Gale Force Nine has reached a multi-year licensing to produce a series of tabletop games from “the full scope” of the Dune franchise, including the original book series from creator Frank Herbert, as well as son Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson’s continuation of the franchise following Frank Herbert’s death. We can also expect games that tie directly to Villeneuve’s adaptation, which should debut in 2020. The first official Dune game to come out of this partnership will be a tabletop RPG, and it’s set to come out in late 2019. No word yet what it will be about or what parts of the franchise it will cover, but we do know it’s a collaboration with Modiphius, the team behind Star Trek Adventures and Tales From the Loop. Gale Force Nine’s CEO said it’s the first of many tabletop games they’re looking to produce over the next several years. So buckle your sandworm seatbelts. “This is only the beginning of our big plans in tabletop for this captivating franchise,” Gale Force Nine CEO John Paul Brisigotti said. “Dune is a rich and wonderful universe, and we expect to produce an equally expansive and inspired line of games for years to come.” Legendary Entertainment is clearly banking a lot on Dune being its new big franchise. Back in 2016, they bought the rights to the entire Dune franchise for an undisclosed amount of money, with plans for both film and TV adaptations. As of now, the only project they’ve announced is Villeneuve’s movie, which covers the first Dune book. Unlike David Lynch’s 1984 film version, Villeneuve’s adaptation is expected to take place over two movies to better cover the novel. After that, there are dozens of books to choose from.

NASA/JPL-Caltech
While the rover body count has piled up on Mars, there's one wheeled machine that's still kicking. NASA's Curiosity rover is getting back to work after an unexpected mini-vacation caused by a unknown glitch two weeks ago.
Mars fans first suspected something was up when mission updates went silent and no new raw images appeared on the rover site for a week. NASA announced last Friday that the rover experienced a ""hiccup during boot-up"" and went into a protective safe mode. 
The news was worrying, but NASA successfully rebooted the rover many times and declared it to be in good working condition. A mission update issued on Thursday says the rover is now ""back in action.""
Curiosity is checking out an intriguing outcrop nicknamed ""Midland Valley"" in the Gale Crater. The science team is planning a closer look at a ""beautiful chunk of rock"" spotted by the rover. Curiosity is also transmitting fresh raw images taken this week.
""The engineering team is working hard to understand the issue that occurred on sol 2320, and upcoming plans will be dedicated to diagnostic activities,"" writes rover team member and planetary scientist Melissa Rice.
The mysterious boot-up issue is just the rover's latest challenge. It survived a memory glitch in late 2018 and is managing some wheel damage caused by the rough Mars landscape.

Eigenbrode, a biogeochemist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and lead author of the Science paper. “We still don’t know the source of them, but they’re there. They’re not missing any more.”","NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has dug up organic molecules, the raw building blocks of life.

Alexandria Sage,"REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - A monster wildfire in northern California burned unchecked on Saturday after it killed two firefighters, destroyed hundreds of structures and sent thousands of frantic residents racing from their homes. Some 3,400 firefighters on the ground and in helicopters and airplanes battled the 48,300-acre (19,500 hectares) Carr Fire early on Saturday as it ripped through Redding, a city of 90,000 people, in California’s scenic Shasta-Trinity area. More than 38,000 residents in Redding and elsewhere in Shasta County fled their homes as the fire began to gain speed and intensity on Thursday, destroying 500 structures and leaving Keswick, a town of 450, in smoldering ruins. The fire, which was just three percent contained after igniting six days ago, has been fed by high temperatures and low humidity, which were expected for at least the next week, said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) Director Ken Pimlott. “This fire is a long way from done,” he said. A bulldozer operator and a member of the Redding Fire Department were killed in the blaze. A Redding hospital said it had treated eight people, including three firefighters. The flames erupted into a firestorm on Thursday when it jumped across the Sacramento River and swept into the western side of Redding, about 150 miles (240 km) north of Sacramento, before gale-force winds during the night created a fire “tornado.” “This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity, uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways,” Pimlott said. Firefighters and police were hustling door to door to usher civilians out of harm’s way, said Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). California has had its worst start to the fire season in a decade, with 289,727 acres burned through Friday morning, according to National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) data. Governor Jerry Brown requested emergency federal assistance to prevent an “imminent catastrophe” as Shasta County tried to find supplies and water for evacuated residents and care for horses and cattle rescued from ranches and farms. Wildfires have blackened an estimated 4.15 million acres (1.68 million hectares) in the United States this year. That was well above average for the same period over the past 10 years but down from 5.27 million acres (2.13 million hectares) in the first seven months of 2017, NIFC reported. Cal Fire said the Cranston Fire, about 110 miles (177 km) east of Los Angeles had blackened 12,300 acres and was 16 percent contained. The Ferguson Fire near Yosemite, which has charred 46,675 acres, was 29 percent contained.

Reuters Editorial,"REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - California firefighters on Monday were gaining ground on a massive blaze that has killed six people and destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, while rescuers searched for seven people unaccounted for in the wildfire. The Carr Fire, outside Redding, California, ignited a week ago and doubled in size over the weekend, charring an area the size of Detroit, forcing 38,000 people to flee their homes and claiming lives of two firefighters and another person, as well as a woman and her two young great-grandchildren. Centered 150 miles (240 km) north of Sacramento, it is the deadliest of the 90 wildfires burning across the United States. Collectively, wildfires have blackened 4.4 million acres (1.8 million hectares) of land so far this year, 21 percent more than the 10-year average for the time period, according to federal data. The more than 3,000 firefighters battling the Carr Fire began to turn the tables by Sunday afternoon, cutting containment lines around 17 percent of its perimeter, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Previously the fire was just 5 percent contained. Gale-force winds that drove the fire late last week have eased to moderate speeds, but temperatures are again expected to top 100 Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius), according to the National Weather Service. Firefighting officials on Sunday also said they would begin to return people to their homes as soon as possible. The fire grew rapidly beginning on Thursday, confounding fire officials with the speed of its movement. “Unfortunately this new normal is kind of upon us in California,” Cal Fire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox said on CBS This Morning. “More deadly, more destructive fires, more often and it’s obviously requiring additional resources.” At least 874 buildings have been destroyed by the 95,000-acre blaze, Cal Fire said. The fire leveled the town of Keswick, home to 450 people. It also sparked an effort to rescue people’s horses and livestock in the rugged region, a popular fishing destination. Some 260 National Guard troops and 100 police officers were stationed in evacuated neighborhoods to guard against looting, and the Shasta County Sheriff’s office said two people had been arrested over the weekend for looting. Another California fire prompted a rare closure of much of Yosemite National Park last week, while a third forced mass evacuations from the mountain resort community of Idyllwild, east of Los Angeles.

Leigh Morgan,"Now there's Tropical Storm Chris. The National Hurricane Center said the third named storm of 2018 in the Atlantic had formed on Sunday morning about 150 miles off the coast of North Carolina. It's expected to become a hurricane, but the current forecast path turns the storm away from the coast of the United States. As of 4 a.m. CDT Sunday, Tropical Storm Chris was located about 150 miles south of Cape Hatteras, N.C. Chris had winds of 40 mph and was not moving, according to the hurricane center. Forecasters there said those along the North Carolina coast should keep an eye on Chris. The hurricane center noted early Sunday that many forecast models have shifted the path for Chris south and westward. The official track has also been adjusted some, but forecasters said they will wait to see more consistency in the models before making any bigger adjustments. The potential track area still does not include any part of the U.S. coast. The long-range path does move the storm over Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Chris is expected to meander off the coast for the next couple of days, then head northeast starting on Tuesday. It could be a hurricane by then, according to the hurricane center. While Chris isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., rough seas churned up by the storm could cause deadly rip currents along the North Carolina and Mid-Atlantic coasts this week. Areas in North Carolina and Pamlico and Albemarle sounds could also have to deal with gale-force winds over the next day because of the pressure gradient between Chris and an approaching trough of low pressure.

Mike Wall Space.com Senior Writer,"NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has flexed some new scientific muscles, likely solving a Red Planet puzzle in the process.
Mission team members repurposed the rover's navigation gear to measure tiny variations in gravitational fields, a new study reports. This novel strategy allowed the researchers to figure out how the huge Martian mountain whose base Curiosity is exploring formed — namely, that it was probably built up as a free-standing mound by the deposition of windblown sand and sediment.
""Going forward, I think this study shows the promise of making gravity measurements on the surfaces of other planets,"" said lead author Kevin Lewis, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. [Amazing Mars Photos by NASA's Curiosity Rover]
""It really gives you data about the subsurface, which is hard to get from any other instruments,"" Lewis told Space.com.
The car-size Curiosity rover landed on the floor of the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater in August 2012, tasked with investigating the area's past potential to host life. This work has been incredibly fruitful; Curiosity's observations show that Gale harbored a lake-and-stream system for long stretches — perhaps hundreds of millions of years at a time — in the ancient past.
Gale Crater is intriguing for other reasons as well. For example, a mountain rises 3.4 miles (5.5 km) into the Martian sky from its center — a dramatic geological oddity that has no close parallel here on Earth.
Scientists have long debated just how this odd massif, known as Mount Sharp , took shape. Is it the remnant of a sedimentary structure that once filled Gale Crater but was worn away by erosion? Or did Mount Sharp coalesce in its current form, growing as Martian winds dropped dirt and sand into Gale Crater?
That's where the new study, which was published online today (Jan. 31) in the journal Science, comes in. Lewis and his colleagues mapped out the gravitational-field strength at more than 700 points along Curiosity's traverse, which has taken the rover from Gale's floor up into Mount Sharp's foothills. (Gravitational fields weaken as altitude, and therefore distance from a planet's core, increases.)
Using these ""gravimetry"" measurements, the researchers calculated the density of the rocks beneath Curiosity's wheels — about 1,680 kilograms per cubic meter. That's low, meaning those rocks are pretty porous. [Ancient Mars Lakes &amp; Laser Blasts: Curiosity Rover's 10 Biggest Moments in 1st 5 Years]
""It's probably more like a compacted soil than what you might think of as a nice, really well-cemented rock,"" Lewis said.
If these deposits had once been buried under 3 miles (5 km) of other sediments, they would almost certainly be much denser, he added. So, the new results argue that Mount Sharp was primarily built up by wind-blown deposits, not pared down from a crater-filling feature.
This isn't to suggest that a potentially habitable lake didn't once occupy Gale Crater's floor; Curiosity's observations of lakebed sediments have established this water body's past existence with high confidence, Lewis stressed. But those sediments apparently didn't go all the way to the crater rim. It remains unclear how high they got — where the transition between lake sediments and windblown deposits lies on Mount Sharp's slopes.
Orbital observations have identified an intriguing ""unconformity"" — a break in the previously continuous sedimentary-rock record — about 2,600 feet (800 m) above Curiosity's current location, Lewis said. So, that region is a candidate.
""We'll see if Curiosity makes it up there, or if we get pieces of that upper unit that roll down the mountain,"" Lewis said. ""But we may have to do a bit more exploring to find such a transition.""
But let's get back to the gravity data. Curiosity doesn't carry any dedicated gravimetry instruments, so how did Lewis and his team make their measurements?
By thinking outside the box. Curiosity has two ""rover inertial measurement units"" (RIMUs), a primary and a backup. Both RIMUs consist of three accelerometers and three gyroscopes, which the rover's handlers normally use for navigation and to determine Curiosity's orientation in space. But Lewis wondered if these engineering data could be recalibrated to capture information about gravitational fields.
""It's something that I had thought about it for a long time,"" he said. ""I didn't expect to have precision that was high enough to be able to use for science purposes. But I started looking into the data and calibrating out some of the complicating factors, like temperature and some other variables. And, lo and behold, it got to the point where the precision was actually scientifically meaningful.""
The team was therefore able to build up the first-ever ""gravity traverse"" on the surface of another planet. The only other such work done off Earth was performed on the moon, by the Apollo 17 astronauts in 1972, Lewis said.
Future rover missions to Mars and other planets could make similar measurements, Lewis said. But the strategy his team used isn't universally applicable. For example, researchers probably cannot dredge gravimetry measurements out of the engineering data gathered over the years by NASA's Spirit and Opportunity Marrovers.  Those two golf-cart-size robots collected their engineering data in a slightly different way, Lewis said.

 Of the 270 containers that fell off the MSC Zoe well over 200 were still unaccounted for on Thursday
Extensive debris has washed up on islands off the Dutch north coast after some 270 containers including chemicals fell off a cargo ship in a storm.
As the extent of pollution became clear on five islands including Terschelling, coastguards searched the North Sea for missing containers.
The cargo fell off the MSC Zoe near the German island of Borkum, but the tide carried many of them to the south-west.
Initial images showed children's toys and TVs on Dutch beaches.
But officials said three missing containers carried a toxic powder of organic peroxide, and Dutch and German coastguards warned local people to steer clear of them.
What happened to the MSC Zoe?
The Panama-registered ship is described as the biggest in Europe, with a potential cargo of 19,000 containers. 
As Storm Zeetje buffeted northern Germany with gale force winds late on Tuesday night, 270 containers of Zoe's cargo fell off the ship and into the Wadden Sea.

 An aerial view of the ship showed the disarray on board the MSC Zoe
By Wednesday morning, strong tides had already swept some of the containers on to beaches on Terschelling, Vlieland and Ameland and coastguards were scouring the sea for the others.
There were fears that other shipping could be damaged by the cargo. The Geneva-based MSC company which owns the ship has asked a salvage company to use sonar equipment to help retrieve the missing containers.
Overnight into Thursday, the MSC Zoe docked at Bremerhaven. Several containers were spotted in German waters and a further 11 were seen by the Dutch coastguard floating between the islands of Ameland and Schiermonnikoog.
How bad is the pollution?
By Thursday five Dutch islands in the Wadden Sea had seen debris from the MSC Zoe wash up on its beaches. 
On Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog volunteers were helping on Thursday to clear up the mess spilt the previous day.
Among the rubbish found on Terschelling's long, sandy beaches were shoes, bags, cushions, chairs and plastic cups. Children found pink toys among the rubbish.
Volunteers had to scoop polystyrene packaging from the dunes.
Further to the east, on Schiermonnikoog, a trail of plastic rubbish, shoes and light bulbs was found on the beaches. ""This is truly a disaster. How are we going to clean this up?"" said local environmentalist Cynthia Borras. ""We were prepared for an oil disaster but not this.""
Terschelling mayor Bert Wassink feared the clean-up could take a long time. 
""We've never seen this before. It's becoming more common to see containers falling in the water but never before on this scale,"" he told public broadcaster NOS.
When the MSC Napoli ran aground off the south-west coast of England in 2007, 80 containers washed ashore. Police had to shut a local beach as people scoured the debris for motorbikes and other merchandise.
Police had to use old laws on scavenging that require people to return goods from the stricken ship.
Although some flat screen TVs were found in the debris on Wednesday, most concerns on the Dutch islands focused on the environmental damage to the area.",A big clean-up starts on five Dutch islands after a storm sweeps cargo into the sea.,2019-01-03T12:31:12Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",MSC Zoe: Islands hit as 270 containers fall off ship,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46746312,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B972/production/_105047474_051413288-1.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,gale,1

Webster reportedly got into a road rage altercation with the woman in Westminster, a suburb of Denver, and then followed Bigelow's vehicle to the Cedarwood Square office complex, police say. There, Webster and the woman got into an argument, and Webster pulled out a handgun and shot the woman multiple times, police say. He then shot her 13-year-old son and 8-year-old son multiple times. Police say Webster was then seen briefly walking toward his car when he then walked back up to the 13-year-old boy and shot him again while he was on the ground. Webster then reportedly made eye contact with Gale, who was sitting in his pickup truck in the parking lot with his 9-year-old daughter. According to police, Webster fired multiple rounds into Gale's truck, striking him in the arms. Gale was able to put his truck in reverse and speed out of the parking lot. His daughter was not injured. Police say Webster then fled the scene. Webster faces charges for first-degree murder after deliberation with intent, first-degree murder with extreme indifference, first-degree assault and criminal attempt to commit a class one felony.

"Mike Wall, SPACE.com","We may be one step closer to cracking the Mars methane mystery.
NASA’s Curiosity rover mission recently determined that background levels of methane in Mars’ atmosphere cycle seasonally, peaking in the northern summer. The six-wheeled robot has also detected two surges to date of the gas inside the Red Planet’s 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater—once in June 2013, and then again in late 2013 through early 2014.
These finds have intrigued astrobiologists, because methane is a possible biosignature. Though the gas can be produced by a variety of geological processes, the vast majority of methane in Earth’s air is pumped out by microbes and other living creatures.
Some answers may soon be on the horizon, because that June 2013 detection has just been firmed up. Europe’s Mars Express orbiter noted the spike as well from that spacecraft’s perch high above the Red Planet, a new study reports.
“While previous observations, including that of Curiosity, have been debated, this first independent confirmation of a methane spike increases confidence in the detections,” said study lead author Marco Giuranna, of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Rome.
And that’s not all. Giuranna and his team also traced the likely source of the June 2013 plume to a geologically complex region about 310 miles (500 kilometers) east of Gale Crater.
Whiffs of Gale Crater air
The researchers used data gathered by Mars Express’ Planetary Fourier Spectrometer instrument (PFS), which also sniffed out traces of Red Planet methane back in 2004. (The spacecraft has been orbiting Mars since December 2003.)
Giuranna, the PFS principal investigator, had prepared for synergy with the Curiosity team. Soon after the rover’s August 2012 touchdown inside Gale, he decided to monitor the air above the crater over the long term, Giuranna said.
It’s tricky to measure Red Planet methane from Mars orbit, for a variety of reasons, including the gas’s low abundance and weak absorption. (It’s no picnic measuring Mars methane from Earth, either, because the much more plentiful methane in our planet’s atmosphere can complicate observations and interpretations. These factors help explain the debate Giuranna referenced above.)  
So, Giuranna and his colleagues developed a new approach to PFS data selection, processing and analysis. For the new study, they applied this approach to measurements made over Gale Crater during the first 20 months of Curiosity’s mission on Mars. 
They found one hit: a peak of about 15.5 parts per billion (ppb) methane by volume on June 16, 2013. That was just one Martian day after Curiosity detected a peak of nearly 6 ppb. 
“We were very lucky, as this is not the result of coordinated observations,” Giuranna told Space.com via email. “Just by chance!”
By the way, background methane levels in Gale Crater’s air, as measured by Curiosity, range from about 0.24 ppb to 0.65 ppb.
Tracing the source
The study team also homed in on the methane plume’s possible source region, using two independent approaches. 
The researchers divided the area around Gale Crater into a series of squares, each of which measured nearly 155 miles (250 km) on a side. They then used computer simulations to create 1 million methane-release scenarios for every square, to assess the probability of each one as a source for the Gale gas. The scientists also studied the geology of each square, looking for features that might be associated with methane emission, such as fault lines and fault intersections.
“Remarkably, we saw that the atmospheric simulation and geological assessment, performed independently of each other, suggested the same region of provenance of the methane, which is situated about 500 km east of Gale,” Giuranna said. “This is very exciting and largely unexpected.”
That potential source region may contain methane trapped beneath ice, he added.
“That methane could be released episodically along faults that break through the permafrost due to partial melting of ice, gas pressure buildup induced by gas accumulation during migration, or stresses due to planetary adjustments or local meteorite impact,” the researchers wrote in the new study, which was published online today (April 1) in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Still lots of work to do
The paper doesn’t address the ultimate origin of the methane—whether it was churned out by Martian microbes or reactions involving hot water and certain types of rock. And scientists don’t know if the detected methane was produced recently or long ago; it could have been trapped under the ice for eons, after all.
But the new study could help researchers get to the bottom of such questions eventually. For example, Mars Express will eye the potential source region in detail in the future, Giuranna said. And other spacecraft, such as the methane-sniffing Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO)—part of the European-Russian ExoMars program—may do so as well.
Indeed, Giuranna’s team is involved with the TGO mission, which arrived at Mars in October 2016. And coordinated TGO-Mars Express measurements are in the works. The PFS team also aims to apply its new analysis techniques to the instrument’s entire data set, Giuranna said.
“Follow-up is very important to better understand methane on Mars,” he said. “We are collecting pieces of a puzzle and need more pieces to understand better what is going on.”

mwilkening,"Jerry Lee Lewis suffered what his representatives are calling ""a minor stroke"" on Thursday, but the pioneering rock and roll piano player and singer is expected to recover in time for his next scheduled performance.
""Last night, Jerry Lee Lewis suffered a minor stroke,"" reads a Friday night post on his official Facebook page. ""He is with his family, recuperating in Memphis and the doctors expect a full recovery. The Killer looks forward to getting back into the studio soon to record a Gospel record and on the road performing live for his fans. His family requests privacy at this time. Well wishes and prayers are greatly appreciated.""
According to his official site, Lewis is next scheduled to perform on April 28 as part of the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. Representative Zach Farnum told the Tennessean there are no current plans to cancel that appearance. """"He's a devout Christian,"" Farnum added. ""We're just asking for prayers and support and privacy.""
Born September 29, 1935 in Louisiana, Lewis began playing piano at age nine and started recording for Sun Records in 1956, as both a solo artist and a session player alongside artists such as Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. The following year, his version of ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On"" and his own ""Great Balls of Fire"" became massive hits.
Controversy over the revelation of Lewis' marriage to his then 13-year-old once-removed first cousin Myra Gale Brown got him blacklisted from the airwaves and concert stages in 1958. He was eventually able to re-start his career as a country artist, and over time has been widely acknowledged and celebrated as one of the most important pioneers in rock music. In 1986 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and his life was the subject of the 1989 biopic Great Balls of Fire.

Joe Palca,"Two rock samples taken by NASA's Curiosity rover were found to contain organic molecules. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS For the first time, scientists say they have clear evidence that the chemical building blocks of life exist on Mars. What they can't say yet is whether there is, or ever was, life on the Red Planet. The new evidence comes from a pair of rocks. NASA's six-wheeled Curiosity rover drilled into the planet in late 2014 and early 2015. The two rock samples, from sites named Confidence Hills and Mojave, are at the bottom of Gale Crater. Powder from the rocks went into an analyzer on the rover called SAM that can determine what they were made of. But the SAM results were hard to interpret — there were a lot of extraneous signals that didn't make any sense. So NASA astrobiologist Jennifer Eigenbrode at the Goddard Space Flight Center spent the intervening years figuring out which signals were clearly junk and removing them. Then she looked at the analyzer results again. ""There were signals there that were telling us that we had detected certain types of organic molecules,"" she says. Organic molecules contain carbon, the chemical element central to life. That raises the obvious question: Where did the carbon come from? ""We don't know,"" Eigenbrode says. She sees three possibilities. ""It could have been from meteorites,"" she says. Meteorites are constant pummeling Mars, and many of them contain carbon. ""It could be from rock processes,"" processes that have been going on during the billions of years since Mars formed. And then there's the most intriguing possibility. Eigenbrode says the analyzed rocks came from the bottom of what was once a lake at a time when Mars was a much warmer, wetter place. ""Because this lake had everything that organisms needed to be happy, maybe there was life in the lake,"" she says. If there was, then that life would have left behind organic molecules when it decayed. Penn State astrobiologist Kate Freeman agrees the new evidence makes that interpretation possible, but ""it's not standing up and waving a flag and saying, 'I'm life.' "" She isn't ruling out that possibility, however. ""I don't believe there's life on Mars at the present,"" Freeman says, because Mars is very dry, very cold and lacks much of an atmosphere. ""Whether there was in the past or not is certainly an open question."" Freeman says finding organic molecules only a few centimeters below the surface of Mars is an encouraging sign for finding possible life. That's because the surface of Mars is constantly bombarded with radiation that can break down organic compounds. There may be more material buried deeper. ""There's a new mission in the planning where they'll be able to drill much deeper than the Curiosity rover can,"" Freeman says. ""That gives me great hope because we can perhaps get past these surface environments that are so harsh and maybe [go] a little deeper and find better-preserved materials."" In addition to finding organic molecules in the rocks in Gale Crater, rover scientists are reporting another intriguing finding. The rover has been seeing seasonal changes in the amount of methane in the Martian atmosphere. Methane is another organic molecule. ""We were kind of shocked to see that with the seasons, the signal changes by a factor of three, which is a huge change and completely unexpected,"" says Chris Webster, a rover scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He and his colleagues think the methane is coming from underground. ""It's coming from sub-surface reservoirs"" and then seeping up to the surface, Webster says. ""Once it's on the surface, the temperature on the surface regulates the way in which it holds on to the methane through 'stickiness,' or surface adsorption as we call it,"" he says. ""So it holds it in the winter time and releases it in the summertime as temperatures get warmer."" Webster says the rover results don't say whether the methane being released has been trapped for eons or is being generated now. The results also don't indicate whether the methane is being created by chemical processes involving rocks alone, or whether some living or formerly living bacteria generated it. Clearly, there are more questions about Mars that need answering. The studies on methane and on organic molecules were published Thursday in the journal Science.","Scientists can't say whether there is, or ever was, life on the Red Planet.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","Catch the sights and sounds NASA's Juno space probe captured as it orbited Jupiter. USA TODAY Nov. 26, 2011: Curiosity is a robotic rover exploring Gale Crater on Mars. This photo released on June 23, 2014, by NASA shows Curiosity's self-portrait. NASA announced on Sept. 11, 2014, that the rover has reached the base of Mount Sharp, its long-term science destination. (Photo: Uncredited, AP) The ""building blocks"" for life have been discovered in 3-billion-year-old organic matter on Mars, NASA scientists announced Thursday. Researchers cannot yet say whether their discovery stems from life or a more mundane geological process. However, “we’re in a really good position to move forward looking for signs of life,"" said Jennifer Eigenbrode, a NASA biogeochemist and lead author of a study published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal Science. The findings were also remarkable, in that it showed that organic material can be preserved for billions of years on the harsh Martian surface. The material was discovered by the Mars Curiosity rover, which has been collecting data on the Red Planet since August 2012. The organic molecules were found in Gale Crater — believed to once contain a shallow lake the size of Florida's Lake Okeechobee. For the past six years, ""the Curiosity has sifted samples of soil and ground-up rock for signs of organic molecules — the complex carbon chains that on Earth form the building blocks of life, according to Science. ""Past detections have been so faint that they could be just contamination,"" the journal said. Now, samples taken from two different drill sites on an ancient lakebed have yielded complex organic molecules that look strikingly similar to the goopy fossilized building blocks of oil and gas on Earth. The rover also discovered traces of methane in the Martian atmosphere, which was reported in a second paper in Science. ""The detection of organic molecules and methane on Mars has far-ranging implications in light of potential past life on Mars,"" said Inge Loes ten Kate, a Utrecht University scientist in an accompanying article in Science. ""Curiosity has shown that Gale Crater was habitable around 3.5 billion years ago, with conditions comparable to those on the early Earth, where life evolved around that time. ""The question of whether life might have originated or existed on Mars is a lot more opportune now that we know that organic molecules were present on its surface at that time,"" Kate said. NASA's Thomas Zurbuchen said that ""with these new findings, Mars is telling us to stay the course and keep searching for evidence of life. I’m confident that our ongoing and planned missions will unlock even more breathtaking discoveries on the Red Planet.” The nuclear-battery-powered Curiosity rover, a $2.5 billion mobile chemistry lab, launched in 2011. NASA calls the Curiosity the ""largest and most capable"" rover ever to make contact with Mars. It's about the size of a car, has a seven-foot-long arm, carries 10 science instruments, 17 cameras and a laser to ""vaporize"" rocks.

Reuters Editorial,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Nearly 40 percent of daily crude oil production was lost from offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico wells on Tuesday due to platform evacuations and shut-ins ahead of Hurricane Michael. Since Monday, oil producers, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp ( APC.N ), BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ), BP ( BP.L ) and Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ), have evacuated personnel from 75 platforms as the storm made its way through the central Gulf on the way to landfall on Wednesday on the Florida Panhandle. Companies turned off daily production of about 670,800 barrels of oil and 726 million cubic feet of natural gas by midday on Tuesday, according to offshore regulator the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). The evacuations affected about 11 percent of the occupied platforms in the Gulf, it said. U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled up less than 1 percent at $74.96 per barrel, reflecting the declining importance of the Gulf of Mexico in output because of the growth of production from the nation’s onshore shale fields. Crude output lost in the two days of storm shut-ins represents about 9 percent of the U.S. production of 11.1 million barrels per day, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. In addition to shutting in wells, oil producers also halted most offshore drilling operations by evacuating three drilling rigs and moving eight others out of the storm area, BSEE said. Coastal and onshore energy businesses also started preparations for what is expected to become a Category 3 storm packing winds of at least 111 miles per hour (178 km per hour). Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors at Southern Co’s ( SO.N ) Farley Plant near Dothan, Alabama, about 100 miles (160 km) from the coast, were observing final storm preparations at the 1,751 megawatt (MW) nuclear power station on Tuesday, NRC spokesman Joey Ledford said in an email. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes on average. The U.S. Coast Guard on Tuesday closed the ports of Panama City and Pensacola, Florida, and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway east of Perdido Pass to vessel traffic, citing expectations for gale force winds within 12 hours. Other ports further west were still operating normally. However, operations including rail car loadings will cease at 5 p.m. at the State of Alabama’s Mobile port, spokeswoman Sheri Collins said. Pilots who bring vessels into the port’s ship channel halted transport due to rough seas and will resume after the storm passes, she said.

Mike Wall Space.com Senior Writer,"Don't worry: NASA's Mars rover Curiosity isn't falling apart. On Monday (Aug. 13), Curiosity photographed an odd, flat object that mission team members initially thought might have fallen off the car-size robot. Indeed, they dubbed the weirdly shaped target the ""Pettegrove Point Foreign Object Debris,"" or PPFOD in NASA-speak. (Pettegrove Point is a section of Vera Rubin Ridge, the landform Curiosity has been exploring for the last 11 months or so.) But Curiosity's observations soon revealed that the PPFOD isn't foreign at all. [ Mars Illusion Photos: Seeing Things on Mars ] ""In fact, it was found to be a very thin flake of rock, so we can all rest easy tonight — Curiosity has not begun to shed its skin!"" mission team member Brittney Cooper, an atmospheric scientist based at York University in Toronto, wrote in an update Thursday (Aug. 16). ""Perhaps the target should have been given a different name befitting the theme of the current quadrangle in which Curiosity resides: 'Rabhadh Ceàrr,' or 'False Alarm' in Scottish Gaelic,"" she added. Curiosity recently drilled a Pettegrove Point rock dubbed Stoer, and the rover has begun analyzing the snagged samples, Cooper wrote in the update. The 1-ton rover has also been measuring the opacity of the Martian atmosphere of late, helping researchers monitor the global dust storm that has been raging on the Red Planet for the past two months. The storm has begun dying down, but there's still apparently so much dust in the air that Curiosity's older, smaller, solar-powered cousin, Opportunity, cannot harvest enough sunlight to recharge its batteries. Opportunity has been silent since June 10, and NASA officials think the long-lived robot put itself in a sort of hibernation. Curiosity is nuclear powered, so it's not terribly bothered by dust storms and darkness. The $2.5 billion Curiosity mission, known formally as the Mars Science Laboratory, launched in November 2011 and landed inside the Red Planet's 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater in August 2012. Curiosity was tasked with determining if Gale has ever been capable of supporting microbial life. The rover quickly answered that question, finding that the crater's floor hosted a long-lasting lake-and-stream system billions of years ago. Since September 2014, the rover has been exploring the foothills of Mount Sharp, the 3.4-mile-high (5.5 km) massif that rises from Gale's Center. Curiosity is reading the rock layers as it climbs, hunting for clues about when and why Mars shifted from a relatively warm world to the frigid desert it is today.

Hilary Brueck,"NASA's 9-foot-long roving Martian science lab, the Curiosity Rover, may have just inched closer to discovering life on Mars. New data collected and beamed back from the rover has given two teams of scientists from NASA new hints about how Mars might harbor key ingredients for microbial, carbon-based life. The teams, which are studying methane and ancient rocks on Mars, are releasing their findings in two separate papers today. The journal Science published the studies online Thursday afternoon. Methane on Mars follows the seasons A blue-hued sunset on Mars photographed by NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/Texas A&amp;M Univ. The first study, led by NASA planetary scientist Chris Webster, represents a kind of sniff test of the red planet. Scientists used Curiosity to record methane levels in the atmosphere around the rover over the course of four and a half Earth years, or more than two Martian years. Their data show that methane concentrations change seasonally: Levels in Mars' northern hemisphere ranged from a low of around 0.24 parts per billion in the spring, then nearly tripled to a high of 0.65 parts per billion by the end of summer. The Curiosity Rover’s path over the course of its mission, up to December 12, 2017. NASA/JPL Temperatures on Mars fluctuate between around 67 degrees Fahrenheit at their highest to −243 degrees at their lowest (near the poles), so the researchers think seasonal changes are behind the shifts methane levels. In the paper, they suggest methane may be locked up underground in water-based crystals called ""clathrates."" Rising temperatures might warm up the clathrates, releasing some methane, which then rises to the surface through faults, fractures, and breaches in the rocks. Methane is important in scientists' search for alien life because it may suggest the presence of life — though not definitively, because geologic processes can also make methane. On Earth, certain microbes release methane as a gassy waste or byproduct, so it could serve as an indirect clue. In their new Science study, the researchers point out that methane may have also helped create past climates on Mars that facilitated the formation of water, since it's an excellent greenhouse gas. This may have set the stage for lakes to bubble up and create breeding grounds for microbes. 3-billion-year-old Mars rocks contain Earth-like chemicals and organic matter NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Another team of scientists, led by NASA's Jen Eigenbrode, used the Curiosity Rover to drill into soil in Mars's Gale crater. The mudstones inside that crater are ancient — more than 3 billion years old. Curiosity extracted some of those rocks, dumped them into an on-deck sample analysis machine, and heated them up to analyze any gases that came out of the samples. The rover found several organic and chemical molecules similar to those you might find on Earth, like stinky dimethyl sulfide that wafts from cooking cabbage, and equally vile methanethiol, which is one of the key compounds in bad breath. They think these tiny stink-bombs might be fragments of larger organic molecules, suggesting that maybe — just maybe — there was once life on Mars, or even still is. ""Organic matter can directly or indirectly fuel both energy and carbon metabolisms, and in doing so can support carbon cycling at the microbial community level,"" the authors wrote in their paper, arguing that the ancient Gale crater, which once held water, could've been an idyllic spot for signs of life to be preserved. Other scientists aren't so sure that these results imply anything certain about life on the red planet. Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) institute, believes we'll find life in space in the next couple of decades, but he cautions that finding indirect evidence of life on Mars doesn't mean Martians exist. ""Chemical evidence, we've been through that before. Even the Viking landers got fooled by some chemical reactions in the dirt,"" Shostak told Business Insider, referencing the NASA Mars mission from the 1970s. But he added that it's always gratifying for scientists to learn more about Mars. ""It takes us, maybe, a little bit farther down the yellow brick road in the direction of finding out whether Mars has biology, or ever did have biology,"" he said. ""Knowing more doesn't hurt you, ever.""","NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover has spent years analyzing the red planet 's methane levels, and discovered they ebb and flow on a seasonal cycle.

Reuters Editorial,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament is debating whether to support Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, a decision which will define Britain’s departure from the European Union and could determine her own future as leader. The odds look stacked against May winning parliamentary approval for her deal, which has come under fire from all sides, including eurosceptics, supporters of the EU and the Northern Irish party propping up her minority Conservative government. Below is a running tally of the number of lawmakers who have so far explicitly indicated during the debate whether they plan vote for and against the Brexit deal on Dec.11. Lawmakers are entitled to change their mind before the vote, and some do not state how they intend to vote. There are a total of 650 lawmakers in parliament. Of those, 102 are government ministers and Conservative party enforcers, or whips, who are required to support the deal and so are not included in the tally. Lawmakers who have indicated they will support the deal: 5 Lawmakers who have indicated they will oppose the deal: 18 Here is a selection of quotes from lawmakers during the debate on why they have made their decisions: SUPPORTING THE DEAL: Roger Gale, Conservative lawmaker “We have three options. I rule out no Brexit, because I believe that it is not what people voted for. I have had to rule out... hard Brexit. I believe that it would be immensely damaging. Even my miserable maths says that two out of three leaves one, and that one is the withdrawal agreement that will be before us on Tuesday night.” OPPOSING THE DEAL: Boris Johnson, former foreign minister and leading Brexit campaigner: “The deal is a national humiliation that makes a mockery of Brexit. I am sorry to say this, these are hard truths, but there will be no proper free trade deals and we will not take back control of our laws.” Margaret Beckett, opposition Labour lawmaker and former foreign minister: “The deal on offer... does not recover our sovereignty. It leaves us rule takers from the European Union without any voice in shaping those rules. It represents what may well be the biggest transfer of sovereignty ever proposed by any British government, because this time sovereignty is not being shared it is being surrendered.” Anna Soubry, prominent pro-EU Conservative lawmaker: “I fear for our country if we set course now, agree to this deal and make the grave mistake of leaving the EU, which has conveyed so much prosperity and delivered peace and a better country.” Reporting By Andrew MacAskill, William James, Kylie MacLellan and Elizabeth Piper; editing by Guy Faulconbridge","Britain's parliament is debating whether to support Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal, a decision which will define Britain's departure from the European Union and could determine her own future as leader.",2018-12-05T15:35:58Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Factbox: Britain's Brexit vote - How many lawmakers are backing PM May?,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-vote-lawmakers-factbox-idUSKBN1O420D,https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png,reuters,Reuters,gale,1
Reuters Editorial,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil companies, including BP, Equinor and Exxon Mobil Corp, on Monday started evacuating personnel from oil and gas production platforms as Hurricane Michael began its trek up the eastern U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center forecast the storm would become at least a Category 3 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale before making landfall Wednesday on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Category 3 storms have sustained winds of 111 to 129 miles (178 to 208 km) per hour. BP said it shut in production at four platforms and that drilling rigs are taking steps to withstand the storm. The platforms evacuating personnel and shutting in production include BP’s Atlantis, Mad Dog, Na Kika and Thunder Horse facilities, the company said. Norwegian state oil firm Equinor evacuated its Titan production platform and Exxon removed staff from its Lena production platform, spokespeople for the companies said. Exxon said it did not expect the staff reduction to affect output. Hess Corp, Royal Dutch Shell and Anadarko Petroleum Corp said they were monitoring the storm and would take actions as needed. Shell was securing some drilling operations on Monday but facilities were still staffed and operating, spokeswoman Kimberly Windon said. The storm is tracking east of major oil lease areas, limiting its effect on production, said John Tharp, operations supervisor at Weather Decision Technologies. Producers should still expect 15- to 20-foot waves, “enough to be disruptive of oil production operations,” west of the storm track, he said. The storm’s current path takes it away from refinery-heavy areas of the central and western Gulf Coast. Shipping ports, including Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida, were open on Monday, but the U.S. Coast Guard warned of gale-force winds in the next 48 hours. Offshore production in the Gulf accounts for 17 percent of total U.S. crude oil output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Natural gas production from Gulf offshore operations provides 5 percent of the U.S. total.

Rachel Thompson,"In the economy of heterosexual online dating, where thumbs wield the ultimate power over a person's love life, height appears to be an immensely valuable currency. The listing of height in dating app profiles has become so prevalent, that many swipers come to expect it, and sometimes hypothesise when it's been omitted from the profile. SEE ALSO: Online dating FOMO is ruining my chances of finding a date In my own experience, I have grown to attach a great deal of importance to the feet and inches in a person's bio. As I idly swipe through Bumble, I will scroll through a dater's photos before perusing their bio, searching for a number that might dictate the crucial decision: to swipe left or right? I'm 5ft8, and I often swipe left (which means no) on men under 6ft. I'm far from alone in this swiping behaviour. Amber Fahrner, 6ft, says height is at the top of her list when it comes to swiping. ""I enjoy wearing boots with a heel and heels itself so I would be lying to myself if I said I was OK with someone being shorter than me,"" says Fahrner. She lists her height in her dating bio, and has been told by some men that she's too tall for them. ""I actually don't mind,"" says Fahrner. ""I'd rather them let me know, as it saves us both time."" Jordan Maahs, 6ft, says she had ""some trouble with the height thing"" when she was using dating apps. ""I really only swiped right if the guy looked taller than me,"" says Maahs. ""If his height wasn't written in his bio, I'd still eyeball it based on his pictures and generally only swiped right on guys that looked taller than me."" Image: rachel thompson / mashable Emma Lumley, 5ft7, says she only swipes right on men over 6ft1. ""I tend to look at the group photos and see if they’re the 'small' friend,"" says Lumley. ""My only justification for being this shallow is that I’m 5’7” and like to wear heels!"" Stephen—who prefers to use only his first name—says his online dating experience was marred by negative interactions about his height. Stephen, 5ft10, says women would ask him his height straight after matching, and when he told them, they would immediately unmatch. He said this made him feel ""ruled out, disbarred and dismissed"" over an attribute he had no influence over. ""I once asked: 'wouldn't it be equally inappropriate and arbitrary for me to ask you your cup size?' to which the response was: 'no, that's absolutely not the same thing,'"" says Stephen. Kunal, 5ft11, says he's had ""weird experiences"" with online dating because of his height. He says that he's neither short nor ""very tall."" He had a ""really great date"" with a woman and went to arrange a second date, but she felt he was ""too tall for her"" as she was 5ft5. ""Another time I found out that I wasn't someone's type because I was too short,"" he says. He says that hearing that he's not the right height for women—particularly when he feels they've hit it off—makes him feel ""slightly confused."" ""Especially given that it is over something I have no control over, since I can't alter my height,"" says Kunal. Are we too picky? Or, just hopelessly shallow? So, why am I—and countless others—so attracted to height in prospective matches? Are we too picky? Or, just hopelessly shallow? Salonee Gadgil, co-host of dating podcast The Swipe Hype, doesn't necessarily think it's a bad thing to swipe left on someone because of a physical attribute. ""I don’t particularly like long hair, and don’t find men with long hair attractive, so I would swipe left. Does that mean I am discriminating? Not really,"" says Gadgil. But, author and ""dating coach"" James Preece says dating apps encourage us to be ""incredibly picky"" and to rule out individuals based on arbitrary qualities. ""Tall men know that their height is a big selling point, so they'll mention it to attract women,"" says Preece. ""Shorter men will either avoid listing it at all if the app or site allows it."" Some even add on a ""few bonus inches,"" says Preece; something he says will only lead to disappointment. He believes that by swiping left on people under a certain height means daters are ruling out ""amazing matches"" based on ""things that don't really matter."" Is it really as simple as just being ""picky,"" though? Scientists beg to differ. Benjamin G. Voyer—a psychology and behavioural science professor at London School of Economics — says the allure of height boils down to evolution. ""Height is a sign of health, and we are looking for health characteristics when we look for potential romantic partners,"" says Voyer. Research by the University of Edinburgh found that our genes play a considerable role in our height preferences of a mate. By analysing the genetic information of over 13,000 heterosexual couples, scientists found that 89 percent of the genes which determine someone's height also influence their height preference in a mate. Image: jennie gale / mashable When we spend so much time swiping through an endless stream of unfamiliar faces, it's easy to get into swiping patterns and even hard and fast rules. Verity Hogan, eHarmony's relationship and dating expert, says that it's normal to compile wish lists that focus on ""aesthetics and surface attributes"" but, focusing too much on these qualities when swiping could be to the detriment of our love lives. ""By focusing on height, weight, or other physical characteristics and disregarding potential partners based on these alone, you could be missing out on the love of your life,"" says Hogan. Putting genetics and evolution aside for a second, there's certainly something to be said for looking beyond numbers. Perhaps we could all do with budging an inch or two on this point.","In the economy of heterosexual online dating, where thumbs wield the ultimate power over a person's love life, height appears to be an immensely valuable currency.

Christopher Joyce,"Waves crash onto the beach near Brighton Pier in England, in January 2007. Gale force winds and heavy rain brought disruption to large parts of the country. Severe weather events like this one may be linked to more frequent fluctuations in the polar jet stream, according to a new study. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images A new study suggests that the polar jet stream has been fluctuating more than normal as it passes over the parts of the Northern Hemisphere, and that's affecting weather in Europe and North America. The jet stream is like a river of wind that circles the Northern Hemisphere continuously. That river meanders north and south along the way, however. When those meanders occur over the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, it can alter pressure systems and wind patterns at lower latitudes in Europe and North America. And that affects how warm or rainy it is on those continents. Researchers at the University of Arizona and the Swiss Federal Research Institute studied tree rings to get a fix on how widely and how often the jet stream meanders. Biologist Valerie Trouet took samples from four species of trees in Europe, including Scots pine, dating back to 1725. These revealed what kind of weather Europe had each year. And that helped them establish the normal pattern of the jet stream's fluctuations. What surprised the scientists was that the jet stream's meandering has become more frequent. ""Since 1960 we get more years when the jet is in an extreme position,"" Trouet says, either in its northernmost or southernmost position. She adds that this pattern of more frequent, extreme shifts north and south has never been seen before in her 290-year record. Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers say these more dramatic fluctuations may be responsible for some recent extreme weather events, not just in Europe, but also North America. ""Heat waves, droughts and floods affect people,"" says Trouet. These ""happen on top of already increasing temperatures and global warming — it's a double whammy."" In the U.S., she says, extreme summer heat in the Midwest is also associated with shifts in the jet stream. When these shifts occur as the jet passes over the Pacific Ocean, they affect warmth and dryness in California and the Southwest. While the researchers don't attribute these more dramatic shifts to any one phenomenon, some climate scientists have suggested that oceans warmed by climate change cause changes in the behavior of the jet stream.",A new study says unusual patterns of the polar jet stream circling the Northern Hemisphere may have led to dramatic weather in Europe and North America.,2018-01-12T21:54:07Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Scientists Say A Fluctuating Jet Stream May Be Causing Extreme Weather Events,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/12/577688119/scientists-say-a-fluctuating-jet-stream-may-be-causing-extreme-weather-events,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/12/brighton-pier-1_wide-60e093692a2126483035d3a8ec4477ac1d11f02e.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,gale,1
https://www.facebook.com/sarah.kaplan.31,"In puffs of gas from rocks more than 3 billion years old dug up by one of NASA's robotic explorers on Mars, scientists have identified several complex organic molecules — possible building blocks for ancient life. It's not aliens. (It's never aliens.) But it is “consistent with the past presence of biology,” said Ken Williford, an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “And it makes us more confident that if biomarkers” — or direct evidence of biologic activity — “are there, we might find them.” In two studies published today in the journal Science, this new finding from NASA's Curiosity rover is paired with another discovery : The planet's methane — another organic molecule usually (but not always) produced by living beings — varies with the seasons. In the past, scientists have seen plumes and patches of this intriguing substance, but this is the first time they've been able to discern a pattern in its presence. The result could pave the way for future missions to pin down the methane's source. “The closer we look, the more we see that Mars is a complex, dynamic planet that — particularly early in its history — was more conducive to life than we might have previously imagined,” said Williford, who was not involved in either study. A reminder: Organic molecules aren't necessarily produced by organisms; they're just chemical compounds that contain carbon. But they're of interest to astrobiologists because they are the essential ingredients in all the chemistry that drives life on Earth. Mars's Gale Crater, where Curiosity has been trolling around for the past six years, is a particularly interesting place to look for those molecules. About 3.5 billion years ago, research suggests, this pockmark on the Martian surface was brimming with water. But the water vanished when most of the Martian atmosphere was stripped away by brutal solar winds. And, given the intensity of the radiation bombarding the planet's surface, it wasn't clear whether any relics from that warm, wet period could still be preserved in mudstones on the lake's dried-up floor. Using Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument — which heats soil and rock samples to examine their contents — astrobiologist Jennifer Eigenbrode and her colleagues were able to identify an array of interesting organic molecules: ring structures known as aromatics, sulfur compounds and long carbon chains. Even more compelling was the fact that these compounds seemed to have broken off even bigger, more complex “macromolecules” — substances found on Earth in coal, black shale and other ancient organic remains. “What we have detected is what we would expect from a sample from an ancient lake environment on Earth,” said Eigenbrode, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. There are some non-biological explanations for the detection — this combination of compounds has also been found in meteorites. But that explanation, too, suggests a provocative possibility; even if the organic molecules didn't come from life, they are exactly what life likes to eat. Perhaps the meteorite-delivered molecules provided fuel for ancient alien organisms. Regardless, the detection is a technical achievement, said Williford, because it demonstrates that organic molecules can persist near Mars's surface for billions of years. If scientists keep drilling deeper and more widely, as they plan to do with the European and Russian space agencies' ExoMars rover and NASA's Mars 2020 mission, who knows what they might find? (Williford is deputy project scientist for Mars 2020.) The methane study, spearheaded by JPL atmospheric scientist Chris Webster, is also intriguing for astrobiologists. On Earth, 1,800 out of every billion molecules in the atmosphere is methane, and 95 percent of it comes for biological sources: burning fossil fuels, decomposing debris, burping cows. Some of our planet's earliest organisms may have been methanogens — microbes that eat organic molecules and exhale methane gas. Several spacecraft including Curiosity have detected whiffs of this gas that “defied explanation,” Webster said. Methane is quickly broken down by radiation, so it must be replenished by some source on the planet. One explanation “that no one talks about but is in the back of everyone's mind,” as Goddard planetary scientist Mike Mumma put it to Science last winter, is that methanogens beneath the Martian surface were breathing it out. “You'd expect life to be seasonal,” Mumma noted. But it was also possible that puffs of methane were delivered to the desert world by crashing meteorites or other less thrilling sources. By examining data spanning nearly three Martian years (six Earth years), Webster and his colleagues discerned the first repeating pattern in Martian methane. During the summer months, levels of the gas detected by Curiosity rose to about 0.7 parts per billion; in winter, they fell to roughly half that. They suggest that warmer conditions might release the gas from reservoirs beneath the surface. The results don't explain shorter-lived spikes in methane levels — as high as 45 parts per billion — that have been detected. And even if the reservoir explanation is correct, it remains to be seen what's feeding them. To determine whether the methane is biological, Webster said, scientists can weigh the kinds of carbon atoms it contains (life prefers the lighter versions). Future missions might also seek places where there's “significant seepage” and attempt to figure out its source. In a commentary for Science, astrobiologist Inge Loes ten Kate of the Utrecht University in the Netherlands, explained what makes these two studies so compelling: “Curiosity has shown that Gale crater was habitable around 3.5 billion years ago, with conditions comparable to those on the early Earth, where life evolved around that time,” she wrote. “The question of whether life might have originated or existed on Mars is a lot more opportune now that we know that organic molecules were present on its surface at that time.” Read more : Why NASA still believes we might find life on Mars Can Mars, or any other planet, have just a little bit of life?

This is something Tom Taylor Marvel and DC Comics writer and creator of TV series The Deep recently discovered firsthand.
Taylor is currently working on a bunch of different projects: Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man for Marvel, DCeased for DC Comics (a horror book which sounds very appropriate in this case) and a feature film. To get his head down and focus, he decided to spend a few nights in a log cabin in the Australian bush.
And that's when things got spooky.
Here's Taylor's wonderfully creepy thread, in full:
So, hey.I somehow managed to book a creepy log cabin to do some intensive writing in for a few days...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
Ive been laughing to myself about just how cliched-horror-movie this cabin is. But at 5.30am, out of nowhere, despite it blowing a gale out there for hours, wind chimes start chiming for the first time from the porch...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
Now, Im just about to go to bed, but Im not sleeping through annoying, spontaneous wind chimes, so I head out there...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
And I see the wind chimes hanging on a rusty hook. I figure I can reach them, and I walk out onto the porch in my socks.And the door immediately slams shut behind me. Of course...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
I frantically check the doors not locked. It isnt. Im not stuck on this porch in this gale in my socks and a T-shirt. But I do hear something in the bushes...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
I dont think much of it. Theres been possums running all over the roof all night (cute Australian possums, not those weird US ones). Its the bush, things are allowed to move in bushes...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
I manage to stand on my tippy toes and grab the rusted wind chimes from the rusted nail theyre hanging on, and I hear the noise again...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
Now Im kind of giggling to myself because of how creeped out Im feeling, so I grab my phone to take a photo of the murder cabin Im writing in for a few days. Here it is... pic.twitter.com/M6iFVSJofI
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
And straight after I take the photo, theres a flash. I check to see if my phones flash is on - it is. I try to turn it off to take another photo, but something flashes over me...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
And it didnt come from my phone...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
And theres the sound again. But this time its heavier. Like a footstep...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
And theres another flash against the wall of the cabin.I pull my phone out of my pocket, thinking Ive left the torch on, which I somehow have, and I manage to shine it in my own face as I try to turn it off to take another photo of the cabin...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
But then I realize I didnt shine my phone in my face. Something else flashed in my face, &amp; my brain is yelling at me...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
Im telling myself Im being stupid and that I did flash my own face &amp; the footstep was probably a kangaroo or something, so I turn to confront the animal making the sound, and...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
And, at 5.30am, in the dark, outside the murder cabin, SOMEONE IS STANDING THERE...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
I cant see their face. Theyre wearing a head torch...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
And Im running. I know I slipped at some stage in my socks, as I ran up the porch. I definitely kicked the wind chimes. I ran through the door and slammed it shut and locked it...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
And heres the thing. Several tweets later, Im sure it was probably just a super-early-morning jogger or something, who was curious about the guy standing in his socks taking photos of a cabin with a flash...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019

Update: I just heard the wind chimes again. The wind chimes I know for fact arent hanging up anymore.
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
THIS IS SCREWED. I am not joking. Lying in bed and the bedroom door just suddenly blew open with a bang...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 25, 2019
I realize its been 8 hours. Just wanted to let you all know, Im okay. The story didnt end there, but my phone battery did, and the charger was in my car OUTSIDE - so, you know, physically impossible to retrieve...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
So, this is what happened next.Before my phone died, I spoke to my wife and told her I was sure Id be fine. And then I took a video... of the bedroom ceiling...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
Im lying there staring at the ceiling, which is apparently counting down to my death, when the wind chimes rattle across the porch floor, and then something very big runs across the roof...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
Im assuming it was a large possum, and definitely not a hellbeast.Eventually, exhausted, I close my eyes...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
And I wake up to a BANG!Im instantly more awake than Ive ever been before. Im on my feet, but I dont remember getting out of bed...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
Someone is BASHING ON THE FRONT DOOR...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
Im standing motionless, in my underwear, ignoring the still-ticking ceiling, trying not to breathe too loud, trying not to make a single sound. I AM A PETRIFIED NINJA...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
The bashing starts again... Without stopping to do anything sensible that would make me feel less vulnerable, like put on pants, I walk slowly to the front door, and theres a large shadow on the venetian blinds. A very big person is standing on the porch of this remote cabin...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
The bashing starts again. I, eloquently, call out, WHAT?!The bashing stops...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
I see the guy shift and he calls out.Package...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
After the night Ive had l, theres no way Im opening the door to a stranger delivering a package to a remote cabin...Also, Im in my underwear.Also, I cant open the door because I frantically locked it during the night and I have no idea what Ive done with the keys...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
He calls out, Can you sign for it?After a way-too-long-and-awkward-pause, I say, Um... No?...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
Helpfully, I call out, Just leave it, mate!I cant really...JUST LEAVE IT!...
 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) March 26, 2019
Taylor told Mashable that he has another four nights left in the cabin.
""Im slightly concerned, but determined to write this film, despite the very real possibility of sudden undead hordes,"" he said. ""The package is sitting, unopened, on the table next to my computer. It hasnt started screaming... yet.""

Elizabeth Howell Space.com Contributor,"NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars found tiny, dark bumps on a Martian ridge that are similar to those found around gypsum crystals that form in drying lakes on Earth, according to a statement from the space agency. The tiny bumps are less than a half an inch wide. Some are star-shaped, while others are part of more complex V-shaped ""swallowtails."" The features are not crystals themselves, but could have formed over the crystals, like plaster over a mold. Researchers think the features are yet another sign that liquid water once flowed on the Red Planet. ""These [types of features] can form when salts become concentrated in water, such as in an evaporating lake,"" Sanjeev Gupta, a Curiosity science team member at Imperial College, London, said in a statement from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Gupta previously studied gypsum crystals in the rocks of Scotland. [ Photos: Spectacular Mars Vistas by NASA's Curiosity ] Members of the Curiosity team are considering multiple possibilities for the features, which were found in Gale Crater, at a site nicknamed ""Jura."" The site is in a larger zone, called ""Vera Rubin Ridge."" The team is not sure when the crystal features formed, relative to when the sediments surrounding them accumulated. The crystals could have formed in wet sediment in a drying lake or in water trickling through the sediment underground, after it hardened into rock. More From Space.com It's also unclear whether the shapes contain the original crystal or mineral that formed them, or if those crystals dissolved away and were perhaps replaced by something else. ""Some of the features shaped like gypsum crystals appear darker than gypsum, are enriched in iron, or are empty,"" according to the statement. (The ""empty"" features no longer contain the crystals that formed them). These are clues that the original crystallizing material may have been replaced or removed by later effects of underground water."" ""So far on this mission, most of the evidence we've seen about ancient lakes in Gale Crater has been for relatively fresh, non-salty water,"" Ashwin Vasavada, a Curiosity project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in the statement. ""If we start seeing lakes becoming saltier with time, that would help us understand how the environment changed in Gale Crater, and it's consistent with an overall pattern that water on Mars became more scarce over time."" Whatever the crystals' origin, team members expressed their surprise in running across them. ""These tiny 'V' shapes really caught our attention, but they were not at all the reason we went to that rock,"" Abigail Fraeman, a Curiosity science team member at JPL, said in the statement. ""We were looking at the color change from one area to another. We were lucky to see the crystals. They're so tiny, you don't see them until you're right on them."" A treasure trove of targets Vera Rubin Ridge is located on the north slope of lower Mount Sharp inside Gale Crater. Curiosity landed in the crater in August 2012. It has been making its way up Mount Sharp since September 2014, examining the layers of the mountain to learn more about how it was formed. At the ridge, investigators found many other targets to consider, including different colors in the bedrock and mineral veins, and variations in the sedimentary layers and local rock iron content, according to the statement. Curiosity also spotted some rice-grain-size features that look like ""sticks,"" which attracted attention when the raw images were posted online. Although some media outlets reported that they looked like fossils, the rover team said the ""sticks"" are likely bits of the same material that makes up the dark mineral veins. [ Life on Mars: Exploration &amp; Evidence ] ""There's just a treasure trove of interesting targets concentrated in this one area,"" Vasavada said. ""Each is a clue, and the more clues, the better. It's going to be fun figuring out what it all means."" Curiosity began climbing Vera Rubin Ridge about five months ago and is now uphill on the southern edge. There, researchers are looking at features that could be linked to another transitional area farther up, called the ""Clay Unit,"" because clay features were spotted in data taken from orbit. Researchers also noted that changes in the iron content in the ridge's mineral veins could have been important for potential life-forms that might have once called the Red Planet home. Different types of iron oxides vary in how well they dissolve in water. If an environment has many different types of iron oxides, that can provide a potential energy source for life-forms, NASA said.

Effectively, this means that the hurricanes forced natural selection in real-time, the scientists suggest. “Day in and day out, natural selection favors those lizards who can run around branches, find food, and find mates,” lead author of the study Colin Donihue said in an interview. “It’s only in these atypical instances like hurricanes that we would be able to see a shift away from historical selection.” With the frequency and intensity of hurricanes ramping up, species within affected ecosystems are being forced to adapt to extreme conditions. It's even possible that certain adaptations might aid survival chances in one instance, and hurt them in another, Martha Muñoz, an evolutionary biologist not affiliated with the study, said. ""One trait can enable survivorship in a storm, like shorter hind limbs, but on a daily basis longer hind limbs will help these animals escape predation because it helps them run faster,"" Muñoz said. But it would take an entirely different study to determine how this selection affects the future of the species, and findings like this are rare. In fact, the data from Donihue and colleagues was due to a coincidence. They had just completed a survey of the lizard population immediately before the hurricanes swept through the island. After the hurricanes, they recognized that they had a unique opportunity, and decided to return. The hurricanes key to their research, Irma and Maria, have gone down as two of the worst natural disasters to affect the Caribbean — where it's possible that almost 5,000 people have lost their lives. And a year later, some places affected, like Puerto Rico and Dominica, still don't have power. The literature on the impact of extreme weather events on localized animal populations is a relatively scarce, but burgeoning field due to increased extreme weather. A study published in 2017 found that a polar vortex that hit the Southeast in 2014 drove selection in a population of green anole lizard. The NOAA's GOES-East satellite captured the 2014 polar vortex hovering over the United State's southeast. Image: NASA The researchers behind that study were able to survey the population of lizards before and after the weather event, and found that the surviving population of lizards had many of the genetic qualities in northern populations of the same species. For example, the surviving lizards had an abnormally high tolerance for cold weather in that region. Aside from these two studies, there isn’t much known about how fast-acting extreme weather events change animal populations on a large scale. But with extreme weather events becoming more and more common as human-caused climate change continues, it’s likely that the common agents of natural selection will shift toward those which influence survival during these catastrophes. “The key to this study is understanding that natural selection is on-going and is constantly in the background,” Donihue said The next step? Muñoz suggests going back to the island a year later and measuring the new generation of lizards to see if this natural selection has truly translated into evolution.",The extreme winds from last year's destructive hurricane season seems to have come with some unexpected consequences.

Jackson Ryan,"NASA officially bid farewell to Mars rover Opportunity in February, but the little robotic explorer is still delivering the goods.
On March 12, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) revealed a set of glorious 360-degree panoramas nabbed by Opportunity in Perseverance Valley, right on the western rim of a huge Martian crater known as Endurance. 
And sure, we've seen some remarkable Mars panoramas before, including those captured at Gale Crater by Opportunity's younger sister, Curiosity. But this one feels a little more special, considering Opportunity has come to rest in this very spot -- with this immaculate view -- until humans (or other sentient beings) are able to retrieve it.
NASA/JPL-Caltech/Cornell/ASU
The color panorama was built via a sequence of 354 images snapped by the rover's Panoramic Camera between May 13 and June 10, 2018. It shows a number of interesting features of Perseverance Valley, in addition to the pristine, unexplored floor of Endurance Crater. The black-and-white frames at the image's bottom-left are a result of the rover not having time to snap the location with its filters before a planet-wide dust storm encircled Mars.
""This final panorama embodies what made our Opportunity rover such a remarkable mission of exploration and discovery,"" said John Callas, Opportunity project manager at JPL.

Although the panorama provides one last look of Opportunity's resting grounds, the rover's very last image tells a slightly bleaker tale. That incomplete image, seen below, shows the approaching dark that would eventually end Opportunity. The noisy image, with a large black bar, makes it seem like Opportunity was cut-off, mid-sentence, as she sent one final communication home. I got pretty emotional about it.

NASA declared the rover dead -- and its mission complete -- on Feb. 13. Originally designed for a three-month mission, Opportunity continued to persevere over 15 years, expanding our knowledge of the Red Planet and providing the foundations for humanity to one day visit our cosmic neighbor and follow in its tracks.

news.com.au,"The mystery of methane on Mars may finally be solved as scientists confirmed the presence of the life-indicating gas on the Red Planet as well as where it might have come from.
In the 15 years since a European probe reported traces of the gas in the Martian atmosphere, debate has raged over the accuracy of the readings showing methane, which on Earth is produced by simple lifeforms.
Because methane gas dissipates relatively quickly — within around 12 years on Earth — and due to the difficulty of observing Mars’ atmosphere, many scientists questioned previous studies that relied on a single data set.
Now an international team of experts have compared observations from two separate spacecraft, taken just one day apart in 2013, to find independent proof of methane on our neighboring planet.
Furthermore, they conducted two parallel experiments to determine the most likely source of methane on Mars to be an ice sheet east of Gale Crater — itself long assumed to be a dried-up lake.
“This is very exciting and largely unexpected,” Marco Giuranna, from Rome’s National Astrophysics Institute, told AFP.
“Two completely independent lines of investigation pointed to the same general area of the most likely source for the methane.”
Europe’s Mars Express probe measured 15.5 parts per billion in the atmosphere above the Gale Crater on June 16, 2013. The presence of methane in the vicinity was confirmed by readings taken 24 hours earlier by NASA’s Curiosity rover.
Using the data, Giuranna and the team divided the region around the crater into grids of 250 by 250 square kilometers.
One study then ran a million computer-modeled emissions scenarios for each section while another team studied images of the planet surface for features associated on Earth with the release of methane.
‘INDICATOR OF LIFE’
The most likely source was a sheet of frozen methane beneath a rock formation, which the team believes periodically ejects the gas into the atmosphere.
Giuranna said while methane was a sign of life on Earth, its presence on Mars didn’t necessarily constitute evidence of something similar on the Red Planet.
“Methane is important because it could be an indicator of microbial life,” he said. “But life is not required to explain these detections because methane can be produced by abiotic processes.”
“Though not a direct biosignature of life, methane can add to the habitability of Martian settings, as certain types of microbes can use methane as a source of carbon and energy,” he added.
Though there is no liquid water on Mars, the European Space Agency said in February its imaging equipment had shown further evidence of dried-up river beds, suggesting the Red Planet may once have been home to simple organisms.
Giuranna said further research was needed to determine the extent of the methane ice sheet near Gale Crater.
If founded to be extensive, the methane it contains “could support a sustained human presence” on Mars as a possible source of fuel for industrial processes and a propellant for returning manned missions to Earth, he said.

Reuters,"WASHINGTON — The Mars Curiosity rover has detected a bonanza of organic compounds on the surface of Mars and also seasonal fluctuations of atmospheric methane, in findings released on Thursday that mark some of the strongest evidence ever that Earth's neighbor may have harbored life. But NASA scientists emphasized there could be nonbiological explanations for both discoveries made by the Curiosity rover at a site called Gale crater, leaving the issue of Martian life a tantalizing but unanswered question. Three different types of organic molecules were discovered when the rover dug just 2 inches (5 cm) into roughly 3.5 billion-year-old mudstone, a fine-grained sedimentary rock, at Gale crater, apparently the site of a large lake when ancient Mars was warmer and wetter than the desolate planet it is today. ""With this new data, we again cannot rule out microbial activity as a potential source."" Curiosity also measured an unexpectedly large seasonal cycle in the low levels of atmospheric methane. About 95 percent of the methane in Earth's atmosphere is produced from biological activity, though the scientists said it is too soon to know if the Martian methane also is related to life. Organic molecules are the building blocks of life, though they can also be produced by chemical reactions unrelated to life. The scientists said it is premature to know whether the compounds were created in biological processes. Whether anywhere other than Earth has harbored life, perhaps even in microbial form, is one of the paramount questions in science. ""There's three possible sources for the organic material,"" said astrobiologist Jennifer Eigenbrode of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. ""The first one would be life, which we don't know about. The second would be meteorites. And the last one is geological processes, meaning the rock-forming processes themselves."" The wheeled rover, which landed in 2012 after a 154 million-mile journey, is more capable of tackling Mars' terrain than any previous rover. It is capable of climbing over knee-high obstacles and traveling about 100 feet per hour. Its exploration of Gale crater has allowed scientists to explore whether Mars ever boasted conditions conducive to life, and in 2014 it made the first definitive detection of organic molecules, also in Gale crater rock formed from ancient lake sediment — but it was a much more limited set of compounds. ""What the organic detections in the rock do is to add to the story of habitability. It tells us that this ancient environment on Mars could have supported life,"" Eigenbrode said. ""Everything that was needed to support life was there. But it doesn't tell us that life was there."" Christopher Webster, an atmospheric science research fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said it is possible existing microbes are contributing to the Martian atmospheric methane. ""With this new data, we again cannot rule out microbial activity as a potential source,"" Webster said. The amount of methane peaked at the end of summer in the northern hemisphere at about 2.7 times the level of the lowest seasonal amount. The scientists were surprised to find organic compounds, especially in the amounts detected, considering the harsh conditions, including bombardment of solar radiation on the Martian surface. After drilling, Curiosity heats the rock samples, releasing the compounds. Referring to the findings regarding organic compounds and methane, Webster said, ""They hint at an earlier time on Mars when water was present and the existence of primitive life forms was possible."" The scientists hope to find better preserved organic compounds with Curiosity or other rovers that would allow them to check for chemical signatures of life. The research was published in the journal Science. Reporting by Will Dunham Related Video:","Filed under: Etc. History's greatest off-road vehicle finds organic molecules, seasonal methane.

Rollo Ross,"REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - The “fire tornado” that ripped through Northern California last week forced residents to flee their homes chaotically, many with their pets and little else, people sheltering in Red Cross evacuation centers said. The blaze, the seventh most destructive in California history, roared suddenly into Redding and adjacent communities after being whipped by gale-force winds into a fire storm that jumped the Sacramento River. The erratic blaze forced 38,000 people from their homes. Most of them are staying at hotels or with friends and relatives. But nearly 300 are at Red Cross shelters in the Redding area, including retired firefighter Steven Bailey. Bailey and others at the shelter said the fire’s towering inferno bewildered them. “It’s tough being on the other side. Being on the engine and going in, that was tough but it was a different type of tough when you get told to leave and you don’t know anything, yeah, so it’s different. I don’t wish anyone to have to experience (it).” Rob McDonald said he left his home in Shasta County hoping the fire would not make it up the hill where he lives, taking only a few personal items with him. “Wish I would have grabbed a few other things. I was thinking it wasn’t going to get up there, it was a just ‘in-case’ thing. And it did. And so I’m in limbo, total limbo as to what’s going on up there,” McDonald said. As the fire approached, people grabbed what they could. For many, that included their furry friends. Volunteers set up a special hall at the Shasta College evacuation center to cater for people with pets, not only dogs and cats but also rats, pot-bellied pigs and a giant tortoise. Frank Williams, who managed to bring his dogs but had to leave his pet birds behind, was emotional when recalling how noisy the animals were when they arrived last Friday. “I can tell you about how quiet it was last night, after the animals being stressed from when we got in here on Friday. You could have heard a pin drop, finally, last night because all the animals were dead tired from barking,” Williams said. Wildfire evacuations have become a fact of life in California, which is bearing the brunt of an extreme run of wildfires across the U.S. West. At least 10,000 people have been dislodged in Mendocino County in California’s wine country from two wildfires. Hundreds were evacuated from the Cranston Fire in Riverside County east of Los Angeles last week. Erratic winds and record high temperatures have fueled blazes that blackened nearly 410,000 acres in California, the state’s highest year-to-date level in a decade.

Rollo Ross,"REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - Assisted by calmer winds at their backs, firefighters in northern California on Tuesday stepped up a drive to surround a deadly blaze raging for more than a week around the city of Redding, as 14 people listed as missing turned up safe. Six others reported missing in the fire zone, 160 miles (260 km) north of the state capital Sacramento, remained unaccounted for, said Redding police Sergeant Todd Cogle, who has overseen the effort to find them. Frustrated in their search after discovering most of the homes of missing individuals were spared from the fire, police took the unusual step of publicizing the names of 20 people whose whereabouts were unknown. Within three hours, 14 of them, previously unaware they were being sought and unreachable by cell phone, were located when they saw their names on television or the internet and contacted authorities, Cogle said. “It speaks to the power of the media and social media,” he told Reuters. Cogle said he was hopeful the remaining six would show up safe as well, adding that at least half of their homes were still intact. The Carr Fire, which erupted last Monday, has claimed six confirmed fatalities since gale-force winds whipped the blaze into a cyclone of flames that jumped a river and roared with little warning into Redding and adjacent Shasta County communities on Thursday night. Whole neighbourhoods were laid to waste as residents fled for their lives, many carrying only their pets and few belongings. Among the dead were two firefighters, as well as two young children who perished with their great-grandmother as they huddled under a wet blanket while their house went up in smoke. Nearly 900 homes and 300 other buildings were reduced to ruins in what state officials now rank as the seventh most destructive wildfire in California history. Some 3,600 firefighters arrayed against the blaze gained further ground, helped by a second day of diminished winds. State fire officials reported 27 percent of the blaze’s perimeter corralled by containment lines, up from 5 percent during much of the past week, even as the footprint of scorched landscape grew to 110,000 acres (45,000 hectares). Some evacuees have been allowed to return home, though as many as 37,000 remained displaced. Lighter winds also gave a boost to some 2,000 firefighters battling a pair of fires at the southern end of Mendocino National Forest, where some 12,200 people were under mandatory evacuation orders. Those blazes, dubbed the Ranch and River fires, have charred more than 74,000 acres (30,000 hectares), with containment measured at 12 percent for the two together. The Carr Fire stands as the most formidable of 94 wildfires burning across 13 U.S. Western states, from Texas to Alaska, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. California, with 17 large active blazes reported, has been one of the hardest hit, with a volatile mix of triple digit-temperatures, erratic winds and drought-parched vegetation fueling intense wildfire activity.

Heidi Kemps,"A decent combat system is undermined by a sluggish story and bland world. By Heidi Kemps The Sword Art Online anime poses the question of what happens when virtual games have life-or-death consequences? Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet is a game that poses the question of “what happens if you turn an anime about a roleplaying game into an uninspired action-RPG?” While it’s a nice change of pace from the faux-MMORPG adaptations we’ve seen from this series, it still doesn’t quite hit the target. Fatal Bullet puts you in the world of Gun Gale Online, the massively multiplayer online VR game seen in Sword Art Online II. Of course, it’s not really VR, and it’s only partially online, but it’s all part of the fiction. You begin as a newbie to Gun Gale Online, customizing an original avatar character and venturing into the world alongside your friend, Kureha. On your very first mission, you stumble across one of Gun Gale Online’s rarest finds: an intelligent, humanoid AI called ArFA-sys. It’s not long after claiming your treasure that you meet the rest of the Sword Art Online crew and get the opportunity to hang out with famous faces from the anime like Kirito and Sinon. The plot takes its sweet time to get moving. However, it doesn’t take long for one of the biggest problems to rear its head: Fatal Bullet has a serious issue with its pacing. You get to play a tutorial dungeon at the very beginning, only to have to sit through reams of character intros and expository dialogue immediately afterward before you’re able to hop back into action. Sure, you can skip cinematics, but that’s not a particularly good idea if you want to have a clue of what you’re doing. But even after the early infodumps, the plot takes its sweet time to get moving. It expects the mystery of your AI companion to drive your interest in exploring the world of Gun Gale Online, but most of the time you just feel like you’re doing odd, disjointed quests without a real long-term goal. The main game is also surprisingly short -- If you just focus on the plot quests, you can finish it in about 20-25 hours. Sidequests help to pad things out a bit, however: you can take on quests to defeat big enemies, eliminate NPC problem players, and find treasures. You can also play in limited competitive and co-operative online multiplayer modes that have you teaming up with (or competing against) other players to take down high-level boss enemies. However, you’ll probably want to focus on the single-player quests, which let you befriend the CPU-controlled Sword Art Online cast. By befriending characters, you’ll earn some serious benefits down the line – though the cinematics that accompany increases in affinity look comically bad, with a bunch of barely-moving characters staring at the screen while talking. In terms of combat mechanics, Fatal Bullet is quite satisfying. You can equip your characters with a variety of different gun types, ranging from handguns to sniper rifles to machine guns, all of which have distinct strengths and weaknesses..And if you don’t like gunplay, you can always equip a sword instead -- though the aim assist system helps a lot if you’re not particularly adept at third-person shooter style aiming. Weapons can be enhanced and upgraded in a variety of different ways, and Fatal Bullet wisely doesn’t force you to play much with weapons you don’t enjoy using. You can have fun using all of your skills and tools to take down a horde of enemies. As you progress, you’ll acquire skills and gadgets to equip on your characters. These skills open up when you reach certain stat thresholds and perform certain actions in combat, and grant abilities like attack and defense boosts, healing bullets, and wild acrobatic shots. Gadgets operate similarly, allowing you access to tools like hidden bombs, poison knives, concealment fields, and first aid kits. Skills and gadgets are both unlimited-use but run on cooldowns, adding a bit of strategy to when and where to use them.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Paleontologists unearthed among the most important graveyards on Earth in North Dakota: the fossilized remains of fish seemingly killed the effects of the dinosaur-ending meteor.
We know that a large asteroid struck the Earth 66 million years ago, and around the same time, the dinosaurs went extinct. Were not completely sure whether the asteroid was solely responsible for the mass extinction, but you might ask, Shouldnt we see remnants of animals killed by the asteroids effects? Well, now we have found some.
This is the last day of the Cretaceous, David Burnham, professor in the Department of Geology at the University of Kansas and one of the studys authors, told Gizmodo. 
When a giant meteorite strikes, youd expect chaotic effects, like rocks altered by the impacts high pressures and temperatures, enormous earthquakes, and tsunamis. But Earths rocks dont directly preserve single days of the planets several billion-year-old history. Youve got to get creative when it comes to teasing apart the geologic record. For example, around the world, layers of rock 66 million years old seem to contain excess iridium, presumably deposited by the Chicxulub impactor that struck near what is today the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. Then there are tektites, small, glassy spheres of compressed and heated rock. Theoretically, there should also be fossilized evidence of animals killed by the asteroids effects.
This is what makes the new research, led by Robert DePalma at the University of Kansas, so excitingthe description of a pair of sediment laters at the Tanis site of the The Hell Creek Formation in southwestern North Dakota. Both layers contain an excess of iridium, but only the lower level contains glass pieces that seemed to have been deposited from an inland-moving force. They take this to mean that theyre observing two events: The upper layer is the settling dust from after the impact. The lower is a large deposit of sediment from the hours following the impact.
But if the rocks alone dont convince you, perhaps the fossils in the event deposit will. A large swath of ocean traveled up the interior of the United States during the Cretaceous, terminating not far from the Tanis region. But the rocks at Tanis preserve a mixture of both freshwater fish, like paddlefish and sturgeon, and marine mollusks called ammonitesimplying that around this time, the ocean had mixed with freshwater rivers. And lodged inside the fossilized paddlefishs gills were more of the glass spherules. It appeared that wave containing shocked glass from the impact over 3,050 kilometers (1,895 miles) away had inundated the area, and in their dying breaths, the fish had inhaled some of them.
Other researchers were impressed by the work. When I first read it, I kept saying wow, wow, wow, H. Jay Melosh, distinguished professor of Earth, atmospheric, and planetary science at Purdue University, told Gizmodo. I think this is one of the most spectacular paleontological discoveries of the century. Its a snapshot of the moment at which major deaths were occurring right after the impact.
The researchers point out that there are other scenarios that might have brought the glass particles up to Tanis. Maybe there were meteorological events like gale-force winds, or landslides, the authors write in the paper, published in PNAS.
But the observations have far-reaching implications. The authors write:
Observations at Tanis expand our knowledge of the Chicxulub impacts damaging effects and their far-reaching scope. The highly probable link between impact-induced seismic shaking and the onshore inundation surge at Tanis reveals an important additional mechanism by which the Chicxulub impact could have caused catastrophic conditions in the Western Interior, and possibly worldwide, far from the impact site. 
Its amazing to imagine how abruptly life on Earth changed in the hours and days after the Chicxulub asteroid hit. And its equally amazing that we could find direct evidence from that time locked away in the remains of the creatures who experienced it.",Paleontologists unearthed among the most important graveyards on Earth in North Dakota: the fossilized remains of fish seemingly killed the effects of the dinosaur-ending meteor.

"Mike Wall, SPACE.com","NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity has flexed some new scientific muscles, likely solving a Red Planet puzzle in the process.
Mission team members repurposed the rover’s navigation gear to measure tiny variations in gravitational fields, a new study reports. This novel strategy allowed the researchers to figure out how the huge Martian mountain whose base Curiosity is exploring formed—namely, that it was probably built up as a free-standing mound by the deposition of windblown sand and sediment.
“Going forward, I think this study shows the promise of making gravity measurements on the surfaces of other planets,” said lead author Kevin Lewis, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. [Amazing Mars Photos by NASA’s Curiosity Rover]
“It really gives you data about the subsurface, which is hard to get from any other instruments,” Lewis told Space.com.
The car-size Curiosity rover landed on the floor of the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater in August 2012, tasked with investigating the area’s past potential to host life. This work has been incredibly fruitful; Curiosity’s observations show that Gale harbored a lake-and-stream system for long stretches—perhaps hundreds of millions of years at a time—in the ancient past.
Gale Crater is intriguing for other reasons as well. For example, a mountain rises 3.4 miles (5.5 km) into the Martian sky from its center—a dramatic geological oddity that has no close parallel here on Earth.
Scientists have long debated just how this odd massif, known as Mount Sharp, took shape. Is it the remnant of a sedimentary structure that once filled Gale Crater but was worn away by erosion? Or did Mount Sharp coalesce in its current form, growing as Martian winds dropped dirt and sand into Gale Crater?
That’s where the new study, which was published online today (Jan. 31) in the journal Science, comes in. Lewis and his colleagues mapped out the gravitational-field strength at more than 700 points along Curiosity’s traverse, which has taken the rover from Gale’s floor up into Mount Sharp’s foothills. (Gravitational fields weaken as altitude, and therefore distance from a planet’s core, increases.)
Using these “gravimetry” measurements, the researchers calculated the density of the rocks beneath Curiosity’s wheels—about 1,680 kilograms per cubic meter. That’s low, meaning those rocks are pretty porous. [Ancient Mars Lakes &amp; Laser Blasts: Curiosity Rover’s 10 Biggest Moments in 1st 5 Years]
“It’s probably more like a compacted soil than what you might think of as a nice, really well-cemented rock,” Lewis said.
If these deposits had once been buried under 3 miles (5 km) of other sediments, they would almost certainly be much denser, he added. So, the new results argue that Mount Sharp was primarily built up by wind-blown deposits, not pared down from a crater-filling feature.
This isn’t to suggest that a potentially habitable lake didn’t once occupy Gale Crater’s floor; Curiosity’s observations of lakebed sediments have established this water body’s past existence with high confidence, Lewis stressed. But those sediments apparently didn’t go all the way to the crater rim. It remains unclear how high they got—where the transition between lake sediments and windblown deposits lies on Mount Sharp’s slopes.
Orbital observations have identified an intriguing “unconformity""—a break in the previously continuous sedimentary-rock record—about 2,600 feet (800 m) above Curiosity’s current location, Lewis said. So, that region is a candidate.
“We’ll see if Curiosity makes it up there, or if we get pieces of that upper unit that roll down the mountain,” Lewis said. “But we may have to do a bit more exploring to find such a transition.”
But let’s get back to the gravity data. Curiosity doesn’t carry any dedicated gravimetry instruments, so how did Lewis and his team make their measurements?
By thinking outside the box. Curiosity has two “rover inertial measurement units” (RIMUs), a primary and a backup. Both RIMUs consist of three accelerometers and three gyroscopes, which the rover’s handlers normally use for navigation and to determine Curiosity’s orientation in space. But Lewis wondered if these engineering data could be recalibrated to capture information about gravitational fields.
“It’s something that I had thought about it for a long time,” he said. “I didn’t expect to have precision that was high enough to be able to use for science purposes. But I started looking into the data and calibrating out some of the complicating factors, like temperature and some other variables. And, lo and behold, it got to the point where the precision was actually scientifically meaningful.”
The team was therefore able to build up the first-ever “gravity traverse” on the surface of another planet. The only other such work done off Earth was performed on the moon, by the Apollo 17 astronauts in 1972, Lewis said.
Future rover missions to Mars and other planets could make similar measurements, Lewis said. But the strategy his team used isn’t universally applicable. For example, researchers probably cannot dredge gravimetry measurements out of the engineering data gathered over the years by NASA’s Spirit and Opportunity Mars rovers. Those two golf-cart-size robots collected their engineering data in a slightly different way, Lewis said.

Al Jazeera,"A powerful winter storm has already hammered parts of the western US with heavy snow and will continue tracking east, bringing more snow, ice and wind into the midwest, Ohio River Valley and northeast this holiday weekend.
This Pacific storm came onshore late Wednesday and into Thursday and brought heavy snow to the Sierra as well as flooding rains to many parts of California.
At least six deaths are being blamed on the storm along with 13 rescues just in the state of California.
The higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada Mountains received up to metre of snow. This along with the very gusty winds made travel nearly impossible on the roads that cross many of the mountain passes.
As the storm crossed the Rockies, the popular Steamboat Ski Resort in Colorado picked up 63 centimetres of snow.
On Saturday morning, the storm had entered the Central Plains and was forecast to strengthen and continue to bring widespread snow, ice, damaging winds and severe storms to most of the Central and Eastern US.
Winter weather watches and warnings have already been issued from Kansas to Maine, with over 110 million now in the path of the storm.
The storm will rapidly strengthen as it moves east on Saturday and then turn northeast on Sunday.
Across the Gulf coast on Saturday severe thunderstorms are expected to bring gusty damaging winds as well as the possibility of a few tornadoes to the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Georgia.
On the north side of the storm heavy snow and strong winds will be widespread from parts of the Midwest into the Northeast on Saturday. Some areas may begin to see some sleet and freezing rain particularly in places where the temperatures hover near the freezing mark, making travel on the highways dangerous.
On Sunday it will be the Northeast and the Canadian province of New Brunswick that receives the brunt of the storm.
Some of the heaviest snow could be seen across the higher elevations of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine with some locations receiving over 66cm.
Sleet and freezing rain is possible along coastal and southern New England.
And if all those winter conditions were not bad enough, some moderate coastal flooding is possible along the Massachusetts coast, especially during high tide. In Boston Harbor a metre of water could pile up because of the northeast winds pushing onshore.
At the airports the storm has already caused widespread delays and cancellations. On Friday almost 5000 flights were delayed. And even before the day began on Saturday over 1100 flights were already scheduled to be cancelled.
Snow across the Northeast will gradually ease on Monday, but the winds will continue to be gusty. Combine those winds with the arctic airmass that will be moving in behind the storm and many could experience wind chills in the northeast as low as -40 Celcius.
Another winter storm will be  making its way out of the Pacific this weekend and will bring another wintry mess next week to many of the same states being currently affect.",Over 100 million expected to be impacted with heavy snow and gale force winds,2019-01-19T10:22:36Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}","US winter storm slows travel in Plains states, heads east",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/winter-storm-slows-travel-plains-states-heads-east-190119090503707.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/1/19/d693ad94b66d44f28da9669b558806ea_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,gale,1

Cory Doctorow,"LA's homeless population is up 75% over the past six years; remove LA from the national statistics and the rate of American homelessness is actually in decline. LA has recently voted billions in new taxes to build 10,000 new homes for homeless people, and another $100 million is due from a fund created by levying a fee on developers, but the new homes are still years away, and the sums, as large as they are, can't keep up with the surging homelessness in LA, driven by a combination of decades of terrible policy (creating a Skid Row sacrifice-zone where homelessness was contained, but not addressed; broken windows policing that rotated homeless people in and out of jail, stripping them of their belongings and any toehold they'd made on improving their lives) and a crazy housing bubble that has driven mass evictions and gentrification. A recent ""no wrong doors"" policy to addressing homelessness has also been a mixed bag, as is documented in Virginia Eubanks's must-read Automating Inequality, with stilted algorithms being used to apportion benefits, often in defiance of common sense, justice and desperate need. Some advocates trace L.A.'s failed policies to the city's 1975 ""containment"" policy on skid row, long the haven of last resort for alcoholics, the unemployable and disabled people. Faced with widespread displacement of poor people during the redevelopment of Bunker Hill's Victorian boarding houses, the city rejected slum clearance of skid row. Instead, officials concentrated very-low-income housing and homeless services in the the 50-block district. But it became a dumping ground for hospitals, prisons and other cities to get rid of people with nowhere else to go. Homeless people on skid row were expected to enter shelters, graduate to transitional housing and finally earn permanent housing through good behavior, including sobriety. But many people fell off that path and never returned. The containment policy is now considered a failure. L.A.'s homelessness surged 75% in six years.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Nasa's Curiosity rover, also known as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), is celebrating 2,000 martian days (sols) investigating Gale Crater on the Red Planet. In that time, the robot has made some remarkable observations. Here are just a few of them, chosen by the Curiosity science team. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Looking back: In the history of the space age, some of the most dramatic planetary images ever taken have been of Earth, but photographed looking back from deep space. This image by Mastcam on the Curiosity Rover shows our planet as a faint pinpoint of light in the martian night sky. Every day scientists from across the world drive the Curiosity rover and study the Red Planet about 100 million miles from Earth. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech The beginning: The first image that Curiosity took came back just 15 minutes after landing on 5 August 2012. Getting our imagery and other data relies on the timing of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) overpasses, a pattern which determines the structure of the martian working day, or sol. It shows a grainy Front Hazard Camera image - the team normally use these to help avoid obstacles - of our ultimate goal Mount Sharp. When this image came back we knew it was going to be a successful mission. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS River pebbles: Once we had started driving (16 sols after landing), we soon came across these pebble beds. The rounded shape of the clasts shows that they formed in an ancient, shallow river, flowing from the surrounding four-billion-year-old highlands into Gale Crater. The inset Mastcam image shows one of the pebbles in close-up. Contrary to our expectations before MSL, the crust being eroded by the rivers was not all dark, primitive basalt but a more evolved composition and mineralogy. Pebbles caught up in this ancient martian river are causing us to rethink our view of how the underlying igneous crust and mantle of Mars formed. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech Ancient lake: Before landing and in the early part of the mission, the team wasn't sure what all of the terrains identified from MRO HiRISE orbital imagery were. They might have been lava flows or lake sediments, without close-up ""ground truth"" it was impossible to be certain. This image settled the debate and was a seminal stage in Martian exploration. Yellowknife Bay is made of layers of fine grained sand and muds, which were deposited as rivers flowed into an ancient Gale Crater lake. We made our first of 16 drill holes on sol 182 - we do this to get rock in to the spectrometers housed in the body of our rover - here at the John Klein site. The results - including identifying clays, organics and nitrogen-bearing compounds - showed us that this had been a habitable environment for microbial life. The next discovery step - Was There Life? - remains to be determined. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Deep water: The Pahrump Hills section Curiosity encountered around sol 753 was key for developing our understanding of Gale's past environment. Here the rover observed thinly layered mudstones, which represented mud particles settling out from suspension within the deeper lake. The Gale Lake has been a long-standing, deep body of water. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS An unconformity: At Mount Stimson, the rover identified from sol 980 a thick sandstone unit overlying the lake deposits, separated by a geological feature called an unconformity. This unconformity represents a time where erosive processes took over after millions of years when the lake had finally dried up - to form a new land surface. This shows evidence of events happening over ""deep time"", similar to those that the pioneering geologist James Hutton described in his field work in the late 18th Century at Siccar Point on the Scottish Coast. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Desert sands: The Namib dunes encountered close up by Curiosity at sol 1192 is a small part of the great Bagnold dune field. Its the first active dunefield explored on the surface of another planet and Curiosity had to pick its way carefully along and through the field as moving sands are an obstacle for rovers. Although the Martian atmosphere is a fraction of the density of that of Earth's, it is still capable of transporting sediment and is capable of creating such beautiful structures akin to those we see in the deserts of Earth. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Wind sculptures: The Murray Buttes, photographed by Mastcam on sol 1448, formed of the same sandstones observed at Mount Stimson and represent a lithified dune field created by dunes similar to those in the present day Bagnold dune field. These desert-formed sandstones sit above an unconformity, and this suggests that after a long period with a humid climate, the climate became drier and wind became the dominant agent shaping the environment at Gale Crater. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech/LANL/CNES/IRAP/LPGNantes/CNRS/IAS Dried muds: Curiosity is able to perform detailed analyses of the Gale rocks with the ChemCam laser and telescope mounted on its mast. Here on sol 1555 at Schooner Head we came across a set of ancient mudcracks and sulphate veins. On Earth, lakes typically dry up in places around their margins and here on Mars the Gale lake was no different. You can see the red crosses where we fired the laser at the rock, creating a small plasma spark, with the wavelength of light in the spark telling us the composition of the mudstone and veins. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech Cloudy skies: This sequence of images was taken with Curiosity's Navigational Cameras (NavCam) on sol 1971 as we pointed them towards the sky. Occasionally on the cloudiest of Martian days we are able to make out faint clouds in the sky. These images are processed to highlight differences, allowing us to see the clouds move across the sky. This sequence shows previously unseen cloud features with prominent zig-zag patterns visible. The three images, from start to finish, cover approximately 12 minutes on Mars. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Obligatory 'selfie': The Curiosity rover has gained a reputation over the years that rivals those of Instagram users for its many ""selfies"" taken along its traverse. These selfies are not all for show though as they help the team track the state of the rover throughout the course of the mission for changes such as wheel wear and dust accumulation. Curiosity's self-portraits are taken using the rover's Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) situated on its robotic arm and are generated by merging a series of high-resolution images into a mosaic. This one taken on sol 1065 at the Buckskin locality shows the main mast of Curiosity with its ChemCam telescope used to determine rock compositions, and the Mastcam cameras. In the foreground you can see that Curiosity has just bene drilling, leaving a small grey pile of tailings. Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Long drive: This panorama taken with the rover's Mastcam shows Curiosity's 18.4km drive over the last 5 years from the Bradbury landing site to its current location on the Vera Rubin Ridge (VRR). VRR was formerly known as Hematite Ridge due to the high concentrations of the iron oxide mineral hematite detected here from orbit. As hematite largely forms in the presence of water, this location was a high-priority target for the Curiosity rover science team to investigate in order to assess how the conditions in Gale Crater changed over its geological history. This key location is the perfect spot for Curiosity to spend its 2000th sol, and for all of us to look back on the many discoveries made so far in the mission.

Tariq Malik Space.com Managing Editor,"On Mars, the sky is dust. A massive dust storm on Mars that covered one-fourth of the planet just a week ago has grown into a global weather event, NASA officials said Wednesday (June 20). The dust storm has knocked NASA's Opportunity rover offline for want of sunlight. The agency's nuclear-powered Curiosity, meanwhile, is snapping photos of the ever-darkening Martian sky. The two rovers are on opposite sides of Mars. ""The Martian dust storm has grown in size and is now officially a 'planet-encircling' (or 'global') dust event,"" NASA officials said in a statement. [ The Mars Dust Storm of 2018 Explained ] The last dust storm on Mars to go global occurred in 2007, five years before the Curiosity rover landed at its Gale Crater site, according to officials with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. The Opportunity rover has been exploring the plains of Meridiani Planum on the opposite side of Mars since 2004. During that 2007 Martian dust storm, NASA also lost contact with Opportunity for days due to low power levels from the lack of sunlight. NASA lost contact with Opportunity last week when it missed a check-in call on June 12. NASA engineers think the rover is in a low-power mode, waking up only periodically to check if its batteries have recharged enough to phone home. All science operations by the rover are suspended while it waits out the storm. ""A recent analysis of the rover's long-term survivability in Mars' extreme cold suggests Opportunity's electronics and batteries can stay warm enough to function,"" NASA officials wrote in a separate update Wednesday. ""Regardless, the project doesn's expect to hear back from Opportunity until the skies begin to clear over the rover. That doesn's stop them from listening for the rover every day."" The Martian dust storm was first detected on May 30 by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Once it was clear that the storm would impact Opportunity, the rover was ordered into a sort of survival mode. A series of photos by Opportunity before it went silent show the Martian sky darkening until the sun itself disappears from view. Scientists measure the amount of sunlight-blocking haze in the Martian atmosphere as ""tau,"" with the current tau at Curiosity's Gale Crater site reaching above 8.0, JPL officials said in the NASA statement. The last tau for Opportunity's site was over 11. The atmosphere is so thick with dust, ""accurate measurements are no longer possible for Mars' oldest active rover."" According to NASA, the 2018 dust storm is not as big as the 2007 dust storm that Opportunity survived 11 years ago. It's more similar to a dust storm seen by the Viking 1 lander in 1977. Past dust storms seen by NASA's Mariner 9 spacecraft from 1971 to 1972, as well as by the Mars Global Surveyor in 2001, were also much larger. During those storms, only the tallest volcanoes on Mars were visible poking above the dust. ""The current dust storm is more diffuse and patchy; it's anyone's guess how it will further develop, but it shows no sign of clearing,"" NASA officials wrote in the second update. NASA scientists are maintaining a full-court press on the Martian dust storm. In addition to Curiosity's weather observations on the surface, NASA has several other spacecraft tracking the storm from orbit: the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey and MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission) studying the Martian atmosphere. The European Space Agency also has two spacecraft in orbit ( Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter ). India's Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft is also in orbit. A key question for scientists is why some dust storms on Mars become planet-enshrouding events and last months while others fade away in a week. ""We don't have any good idea,"" Scott Guzewich, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in the statement. Guzewich is leading the Curiosity rover's dust storm work. New photos from Curiosity show a wall of haze over Gale Crater that is up to eight times thicker than normal for this time on Mars, NASA officials said. One photo also shows a curious lack of shadows. That's because the entire sky on Mars is red and illuminating the rocks from all sides, NASA officials explained. While the dust storm won't affect Curiosity's power levels, the low-light conditions are forcing the rover to take longer exposures when it snaps photographs, NASA officials said. When Curiosity is not taking pictures, the rover rotates its mast-mounted Mastcam camera to face the ground, to protect it from blowing dust, they added.

Morgan Sung,"Good morning, everyone. Apparently we're mad about towels. 
Scrolling through Twitter on Monday, you might have seen a feed full of people arguing over the amount of towels you're supposed to own. The Great Towel Debate started when Twitter user @Advil asked followers to settle an argument between him and his girlfriend. 
SEE ALSO: Surreal memes deserve their own internet dimension
""We have zero frame of reference on the appropriate amount of towels in a household of two,"" he tweeted. 
hello fellow adults. my gf and i have a question... what is the correct amount of towels to own? i said 10 and she looked at me like i was crazy. we have zero frame of reference on the appropriate amount of towels in a household of two.
 abdul (@Advil) February 17, 2019
People understandably had hot takes, but the hottest of them all was from Huffington Post writer Yashar Ali, who claimed that couples should ""own a minimum"" of 50 total towels. 50! Where do you even store that many towels?
Ali added that couples should own ""preferably more.""
He also clarified the difference between a bath sheet and a bath towel, which rightfully blew people's minds. 
It was only a matter of time before people starting passive aggressively tweeting about towels. 
owning a lot of towels is for:1) very rich people2) parents, but only after you leave home and yet all the towels are 15 years old and torn somehow

So the answer seems to be: a bath sheet is a beach towel for people who can trace their lineage directly to Queen Margarethe of Denmark
 Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 18, 2019
You should have at least 3 bath towels per person to cycle through in a given week. Each person should have an Italy towel. The kitchen should have at least 5 towels for surfaces and a bucket under the sink filled with an unspecified number of floor rags.
 salt, fat, acid, yeet (@hermit_hwarang) February 18, 2019
The true cost of towel-ownership is the space it takes up, not the price of the towels, so the appropriate amount to own is a function of local housing costs.
 Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) February 18, 2019
Even the dictionary weighed in. 
And searches for ""bath sheet"" spiked on Google.

 Artwork: Mars Express has been operating in orbit around the Red Planet since 2003
A European spacecraft has confirmed a report of methane being released from the surface of Mars.
The methane spike was first measured by Nasa's Curiosity rover on the surface; now it has been confirmed by the Mars Express orbiter.
The nature and extent of methane in the Martian atmosphere is intensely debated.
The gas is of interest because terrestrial methane can be made by life forms, as well as geological processes.
Methane is only supposed to have a very short lifetime in the Martian atmosphere, so detecting it there means it must have been released very recently.
A strong signal of methane was measured by the Curiosity rover on 15 June 2013. 
The measurement was confirmed in data collected the next day by the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) on board Mars Express.
The results from two studies are outlined in the journal, Nature Geoscience.
Building blocks of life found on Mars
Methane 'belches' detected on Mars
Mars probe despatched on methane quest
""In general we did not detect any methane, aside from one definite detection of about 15 parts per billion by volume of methane in the atmosphere, which turned out to be a day after Curiosity reported a spike of about six parts per billion,"" says Marco Giuranna, principal investigator for the PFS.
""Although parts per billion in general means a relatively small amount, it is quite remarkable for Mars - our measurement corresponds to an average of about 46 tonnes of methane that was present in the area of 49,000 square kilometres observed from our orbit.""
At the time of Curiosity's detection, it was thought that the methane might have originated north of the rover (because the prevailing winds were southward), and that the release came from inside Gale Crater, Curiosity's landing location.
The team made two independent analyses to home in on potential source regions of the methane, dividing up a wide region around Gale Crater into grids of about 250 by 250 square kilometres.
Image copyrightNASAImage caption
 The methane spike was first reported by the Curiosity rover in 2013
There are a variety of ways methane might be produced on Mars.
If microbes still exist, they are one possible source. Methane produced by micro-organisms in the distant past could also get trapped within ice. When the ice melts, it could then release the ancient methane into the atmosphere.
But there are geological processes that can produce methane, and don't require biology. These include serpentinisation - a process of mineral alteration in the crust involving heat and water. Methane can be made as a downstream product of serpentinisation.
Marco Giuranna suspects the plume didn't originate from Gale Crater. 
Scientists scrutinised the region around Gale for features where gas seepage is expected.
This process is well known on Earth to occur along tectonic faults and from natural gas fields.
""We identified tectonic faults that might extend below a region proposed to contain shallow ice. Since permafrost is an excellent seal for methane, it is possible that the ice here could trap subsurface methane and release it episodically along the faults that break through this ice,"" said Giuseppe Etiope from the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Rome, a co-author on one of the studies.
""Remarkably, we saw that the atmospheric simulation and geological assessment, performed independently of each other, suggested the same region of provenance of the methane.""

Mike Wall Space.com Senior Writer,"NASA's Mars rover Curiosity just drilled into a Red Planet rock for the first time in more than a year. Curiosity bored a hole about 0.5 inches (1.3 centimeters) deep into a target rock on Monday (Feb. 26), during the trial run of a new, jury-rigged drilling technique, NASA officials said. The car-size rover's drill — a key tool at the end of Curiosity's robotic arm that allows it to snag pristine samples from the interiors of ancient rocks — has been out of commission since late 2016, when a motor that extends two stabilizing posts on either side of the drill bit conked out. [ Photos: Spectacular Mars Vistas by NASA's Curiosity Rover ] Engineers have been working for the past 15 months to bring the drill back online. They've settled on a strategy that involves extending the bit out beyond the stabilizers, and carefully pushing it against a rock using Curiosity's arm. The rover can keep the drill bit centered using a force sensor, mission team members said. ""We're now drilling on Mars more like the way you do at home,"" Curiosity deputy project manager Steven Lee, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, said in a statement. ""Humans are pretty good at re-centering the drill, almost without thinking about it. Programming Curiosity to do this by itself was challenging — especially when it wasn't designed to do that."" Tests at JPL with Curiosity's ground-bound twin went well, so the mission team took the new strategy into the Martian field Monday. The results were encouraging, NASA officials said, but the drill is not back in operational mode yet. For example, the test hole wasn't deep enough to let Curiosity grab samples. (During its original run, the rover's drill routinely bored 2.5 inches, or 6.5 cm, down into rocks.) And Curiosity will have to bag up those samples in a new way from now on: With the drill permanently extended, the rover cannot use the associated instrument designed to deliver rock powder to two powerful onboard laboratories, known as Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) and Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin), NASA officials said. Instead, Curiosity will sprinkle the powder from the drill bit into SAM and CheMin. ""This tapping has been successfully tested here on Earth — but Earth's atmosphere and gravity are very different from that of Mars,"" NASA officials wrote in the same statement. ""Whether rock powder on Mars will fall out in the same volume and in a controlled way has yet to be seen."" Curiosity touched down on the floor of the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater in August 2012, on a $2.5 billion mission to investigate Mars' past ability to support microbial life. The rover's observations quickly established that Gale harbored a potentially habitable lake-and-stream system in the ancient past. In September 2014, Curiosity reached the base of Mount Sharp, which towers 3.4 miles high (5.5 km) into the Red Planet's sky from Gale's center. The rover has been working its way up the mountain ever since, hunting for clues about Mars' long-ago transition from a relatively warm and wet world to an arid, dry planet. Curiosity is currently studying a landform called Vera Rubin Ridge, which lies about 1,000 vertical feet (300 meters) above the crater floor. To date, the rover has collected samples using its drill 15 times, with the last such activity occurring in late 2016. Since the drill problem arose, Curiosity has pushed the extended bit against rock as part of troubleshooting tests, but Monday's action marked the first actual drilling using the new technique, NASA officials said.

Mike Wall Space.com Senior Writer,"NASA's Curiosity rover is keeping tabs on the huge Martian dust storm that has sidelined its older cousin on the other side of the planet. That storm, which covered as much area as North America and Russia combined as of today (June 12), has engulfed the golf-cart-size Opportunity rover, plunging its environs into perpetual darkness. The solar-powered Opportunity has therefore temporarily ceased science operations. A recent photo by Curiosity suggests that dust may be encroaching a bit on its locale, the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater. But Curiosity is nuclear-powered, so a drop in sunlight isn't nearly as concerning to its handlers. [ Curiosity Rover's 10 Biggest Mars Moments of Its 1st 5 Years ] Still, the Curiosity team is trying to monitor the storm. ""To measure dust in the atmosphere, we'll first point Mastcam towards the sun and take a tau measurement, which lets us determine the optical depth vertically,"" mission team member Rachel Kronyak wrote in an update on Friday (June 8). (Mastcam, short for ""Mast Camera,"" is the two-camera system on Curiosity's head-like mast. The cameras capture color photos and video of the Red Planet landscape and soil for a variety of purposes.) ""Then we'll take a Mastcam image of the crater rim to determine line-of-sight extinction, which is directly related to the amount of dust present. ENV will also take a few movies with Navcam to assess clouds, wind direction, and to look for dust devils,"" Kronyak added. (""ENV"" refers to the mission's environmental-science team. Navcam is Curiosity's black-and-white navigation-camera system, whose images help the rover team plan routes.) This is not the first major dust storm weathered by Opportunity, which landed on the Red Planet in January 2004: An even larger storm forced the rover to stand down for two weeks in 2007. But the dust surrounding Opportunity now is much thicker than it was during that previous storm, mission team members have said. Opportunity beamed a message to its handlers on Sunday (June 10), which is a good sign; it shows the rover still has a decent amount of battery power left. Mission team members have a delicate balancing act ahead if the dust storm persists; they'll need to run Opportunity's heaters enough to keep the rover from freezing, but not so much that they run out its batteries. And Martian cold can kill. Opportunity's twin, Spirit, which also touched down on the Red Planet in January 2004, apparently froze to death after getting stuck in thick sand in 2010. Curiosity has been exploring Gale Crater since August 2012. The car-size rover started its Mars mission on the crater floor, but it's currently climbing through the foothills of Mount Sharp, which rises 3.4 miles (5.5 km) into the Martian sky from Gale's center.

K.Lakshmi,"Parts of coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry will begin to get widespread rainfall from Thursday as Cyclone Gaja comes closer to the Tamil Nadu coast. According to officials of the meteorological department, Gaja now lies over the Bay of Bengal, about 510 km east-northeast of Nagapattinam and 430 km east-southeast of Chennai. It is likely to cross the coast between Cuddalore and Pamban in Ramanathapuram district on Thursday evening, with a wind speed of 80-90 km per hour, and gusting up to 100 km per hour. S.Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said parts of seven districts Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Karaikal, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur, Pudukottai and Ramanathapuram are likely to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall. There is a possibility of extremely heavy rainfall, above 20 cm, in one or two places in these districts. Other parts of the State too will receive rain till Saturday. The degree of rainfall intensity may vary depending on the distance from landfall region. But, this system will provide the much-needed break from the dry spell over parts of the State, he said. On prospects of rain in Chennai, he said the city too will get moderate rainfall from Thursday to Saturday due to moisture incursion. This cyclone too is unique and variations in movement is one of its characteristics. It can be compared to Cyclone Madi that crossed the T.N. coast in December 2013, he added. The local administrations in Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Ramanathapuram, Pudukottai, Tiruvarur, Puducherry and Karaikal have declared holidays for schools and colleges. Pondicherry University has postponed examinations at its affiliated colleges. The Cuddalore administration has also declared a holiday for schools in the district. Weather bloggers also note that Chennai will experience intermittent spells of moderate rainfall from Thursday. R.Pradeep John, who runs the blog, Tamil Nadu Weatherman, said there is a possibility of rain of upto 15 cm spread over three days in Chennai. Areas falling in the path of the cyclone that will move to the Arabian Sea will also see rain. Interior parts such as Kodaikanal and Dindigul would also have rainfall on Friday and Saturday.

This system is a fast moving one compared to the earlier systems and can bring extremely heavy rains in one or two places of delta region. The recent cyclones one in 2000 and the other in 2008 -- that brought extremely heavy rainfall in a single day.","Will bring widespread rain, 80-90 kmph gale-force winds",2018-11-14T19:18:57Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Gaja expected to strike today,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gaja-expected-to-strike-today/article25499869.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,the-hindu,The Hindu,gale,1
Brett Makedonski,"This felt inevitable Gale Force Esports proved itself the best in the world at Rocket League. The squad composed of players Kaydop, ViolentPanda, and Turbopolsa has won the Season 4 RLCS World Championship. Over the course of the weekend, their crowning began to feel more and more inevitable. GFE cruised through the first two days, easily dispatching G2 and Ghost. The finals of the upper bracket as the only time they were truly tested, as Method took them to a deciding seventh game. The Grand Finals featured a rematch with Method which assuaged any doubt that they were the better of the two squads. GFE saved some of its most suffocating play for the Grand Finals as it quickly swept Method in four games. The two most recent World Championships were most well-known for their dramatic endings. It's a tournament with a double elimination format, and Season 2 and 3 saw a team come up from the lower bracket to force a bracket reset meaning that a second best-of-seven series was played. In both of those, the lower bracket team won two straight series to become the unlikely champions. This was a less heart-pounding affair. This weekend was mostly defined by the increasing parity between Rocket League squads, proving that nearly anyone stands a chance in any given match. GFE is the exception, as they were completely dominant throughout the entire tournament. The result comes with a couple of monkeys shed off backs and a slice of history. Both ViolentPanda and Kaydop came up short in previous Grand Finals, and they secured their first championship together. Turbopolsa also became the first player to become a two-time champion. There was also a neat moment after the tournament where Turbopolsa was named tournament MVP, and declined and gave the award to Kaydop. It was an incredible year for all three players on Gale Force. Turbopolsa had the most RLCS success of anyone ever. Kaydop and ViolentPanda won the NBC Universal Open duos tournament earlier in the summer. Then, they played their best Rocket League of the year right now to become world champions. No team deserved it more and that was certainly evident this weekend.

Angela Watercutter,"Every year, the tradeoff is real: What panel are you willing to sacrifice in order to see another? Even in a year when HBO and Marvel are staying away, the days at Comic-Con International are so stacked with events that hard choices need to be made. We feel that pain, and are here to help. Below are all the panels and events that we think will be the biggest deals at this year’s con. It’s not a comprehensive list—there are always gems hidden away for any pop-culture interest you can imagine—but if you’re looking for the blockbusters, these are a good place to start. The Rebirth of the Predator Franchise Writer-director Shane Black starred in 1987’s Predator, the story of a brutal alien who sees the world through a heat-activated, Hypercolor-shirt-like lens. That film inspired a handful of sequels and spin-offs (including the magnificently hyper-violent Predator 2 ), but none with the pulpy pedigree of Black, who wrote the original Lethal Weapon, and directed the high-flying Iron Man 3. His revival of the Predator series stars Wonder -kind Jacob Tremblay as a pre-teen who accidentally beckons one of the space-hunters to our planet, where it wreaks havoc with rangers and government officials before going to battle with an even bigger bad guy: a super-creature rumored to be named the Mega-Predator. Hopefully the members of Black’s delightfully disparate cast—including Olivia Munn, Keegan-Michael Key, Sterling K. Brown, and Jake Busey (Jake Busey!)—will be appearing at Comic-Con, and can tell us once and for all just how much The Predator ’s plot cribs from the Ice Cube album of the same name. All in all, we expect it to be a good day. M. Night Shyamalan Breaks Some Glass News Nearly two decades ago, writer-director M. Night Shyamalan released his post- Sixth Sense superhero drama Unbreakable —and then watched it get busted at the box office by How the Grinch Stole Christmas. But Unbreakable ’s story of an unremarkable security guard (played by Bruce WIllis) who discovers his abilities was championed by comic-book lovers, who marveled at Shyamalan’s grounded, tights-free tale of real-world powers run amok. Fans like Patton Oswalt lobbied for a sequel, and last year, they unexpectedly got in one in Split, the hit thriller featuring James McAvoy as a monstrous creature who lives in the same Unbreakable universe. In Glass, Shyamalan brings together Willis, McAvoy, and Samuel L. Jackson—as high-haired villain Mr. Glass—and all three actors will presumably be in attendance for the film’s big Comic-Con presentation. Expect plenty of evasive answers from the panel about the film itself, as Shyamalan is a master practitioner of that rarest 21st-century super-power: Secrecy. DC Goes Big (Because Everyone Else Went Home) Let’s face it: This year, DC has the run of the place during the traditionally booming and crowded Saturday afternoon in Hall H. In previous years, DC parent Warner Bros. has had a whiz-bang showing, bringing everything from Lord of the Rings films to Justice Leagues and Suicide Squads, but they’ve always had to compete with the likes of Marvel Studios and Fox, which usually saw fit to bring a few X-Men. This year, that’s not the case. At least one Fox hero is coming—there’s a Deadpool 2 panel—but there’s no Marvel Studios, no Lucasfilm. So, if Warner Bros. wants to take full advantage, they need to throw everything they've got at this one. And “everything” in this case will hopefully include footage from James Wan’s Aquaman, an appearance from Wonder Woman/Gal Gadot and her director Patty Jenkins, and Chris Pine/Steve Trevor in a fanny pack. In a dream world the panel would also include director Ava DuVernay talking about her forthcoming New Gods adaptation, but maybe that’s just wishful thinking. The New (Female) Doctor Who It’s a glass ceiling that took more than five decades to crack but the beloved British series Doctor Who is finally getting a female lead. Jodie Whittaker, aka the Thirteenth Doctor, will be on-hand to discuss her new role and likely have fans cheering in the aisles. (The wailing and gnashing of teeth sets off on Thursday morning in Hall H, if you’re wondering.) It’s going to be a big deal, one that fans have been anticipating for a very long time, so it’ll be an emotional room. And the post-panel Q&amp;A—always a plethora of off-beat questions—will likely be full of wonderfully excited Whovians ready to hop in a TARDIS and follow Whittaker to the ends of the Earth. In a con that feels slightly more subdued in 2018, this’ll be a highlight. Deadpool 2 Drops In … and Maybe Brings an X-Force with It? Remember what we said a minute ago about Hall H being awfully quiet on Saturday? Well, one of the things scheduled to make a little noise in that hallowed hall is a panel on Deadpool 2. Wait, Deadpool 2 ? Didn’t that already come out? Yes, it did. Which is why this panel is interesting. Why would the franchise’s corporate parents at Fox grab a slot in Comic-Con’s biggest room on its biggest day to plug the home release of a movie it’s already released? Moreover, why would it do so and then not announce who’s participating? (The Comic-Con website still doesn’t have any details listed.) Call it a hunch, but we’re wondering if Ryan Reynolds and company might use the stage time to tease the allegedly forthcoming X-Force movie](http://ew.com/movies/2018/05/29/drew-goddard-x-force-future-deadpool-2-scene/) from writer-director Drew Goddard. Again, it’s just a hunch, but considering what a favorite the Merc with a Mouth is with fans, it would bring the house down if they pulled it off. Castle Rock Lands On Us If there's one place Stephen King loves more than Maine, it's the fictional town within Maine where he's set multiple books and short stories. Cujo ? That happened in Castle Rock; Dead Zone too. Now, backdrop becomes locus in Hulu's forthcoming original series, which seems to be a going for a whole-multiverse-in-one sort of feel: the recent trailer references everything from Cujo to Needful Things. After years away, a lawyer and onetime son of Castle Rock (André Holland) finds himself called back to investigate a matter at Shawshank Prison (!), where a young man (Bill Skarsgård, Pennywise in last year's It ), has been discovered locked away. With a cast that includes Sissy Spacek and Melanie Lynskey, and enough Kingly material to satisfy even Annie Wilkes, Castle Rock has much to recommend it—even if Hulu's previous King adaptation wasn't a Shining example. Amazon's Prime Cuts It may look like no one can catch up to Netflix's developmental spending spree, but Amazon isn't conceding the streaming wars quite yet, as evidenced by the forthcoming titles teaming up for a creators' panel on Saturday. You've got fan favorites salvaged from the cancellation pile at other networks ( The Expanse ), buzzy podcast adapations ( Homecoming, starring Julia Roberts and helmed by Mr. Robot 's Sam Esmail), Neil Gaiman miniseries ( Good Omens, based on Gaiman's collaboration with Terry Pritchard), and pricey action reboots ( Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, with John Krasinksi in the starring role and Carlton Cuse showrunning). And that's not not to mention Season 2 peeks at Gale Ann Hurd's Lore and Ben Edlund's Tick. So, yeah, six shows. One hour doesn't seem like enough—consider us two-day shippers. Sony Lets Fans See For Miles Sure, Sony and Marvel may have struck a deal to get Spidey into the MCU. And sure, Spider-Man: Far From Home continues that story next summer. But Sony also owns a bunch of arachno-adjacent Marvel IP—and it's spinning its own web in the meantime. If the promise of extended Venom footage doesn't get you into that Hall H line, consider that it presumably comes with a healthy side of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The animated feature not only boasts a screenplay by Phil Lord (half of the duo responsible for the 21 Jump Street reboot and Solo: A Star Wars Story Lego Movie ), but it takes a cue from the comics and acknowledges multiple Spider-Mans. Spider-Men? Anyway, the webslinger this time around is comics mainstay Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore). Don't worry, Peter Parker shows up too (Jake Johnson, just part of a killer cast that also includes Mahershala Ali, Lily Tomlin, and Bryan Tyree Henry). And hell, even if you hate spiders, it sounds like James Gunn has something up his sleeve. The Horror of Halloween Ever since John Carpenter’s babysitter-shocking 1978 original, the Halloween series has suffered under the curse of Michael Myers: Several (mostly) hollow sequels, a slashed-up timeline, and a nagging sense of obsolescence in the era of supernatural horror hits like The Conjuring. The latest Halloween sequel, the first since 2002, is intended to clear out the canon. Directed by Stronger and Pineapple Express filmmaker David Gordon Green—and co-written by Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley— Halloween pretends those other installments never existed, instead follows the events of the original film, in which young Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) was pursued by the masked killer known as The Shape. Forty years later, Myers has escaped, and Laurie is eager to finish him for good. Expect Hall H to fill with Halloween fans happily singing along to the original’s Plink -plink-plink- Plink -plink-plink theme song. Here’s hoping they remembered to bring along the correct mask. The Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog Reunion Friends, how has it been a decade since Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog ? It feels like just yesterday Neil Patrick Harris’ wannabe baddie charmed his way into our hearts, no? Regardless, that milestone is upon us and now the lovely web series that sprung to life from the mind of Joss Whedon during the 2008 writers’ strike is having a lil’ reunion at this year’s con. Whedon is expected to attend, along with his brother Jed Whedon, and stars Nathan Fillion, Felicia Day, and Maurissa Tancharoen. (Sadly, Harris isn’t currently on the lineup.) Expect a lot of laughs and at least one panelist to break out in song. ::Fingers crossed:: More Great WIRED Stories","Horror sequels, a Momoa-shaped tsunami, and the Spider-Man we've all been waiting for—SDCC may be light this year, but there's plenty to look forward to.",2018-07-18T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Comic-Con 2018: What We're Most Looking Forward to at This Year's Convention,https://www.wired.com/story/comic-con-2018-preview/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b4e73eebeabfb0b6ce34a20/191:100/pass/aquaman.jpg,wired,Wired,gale,1
Curtis M. Wong,"When “ Queer as Folk ” debuted in 2000, the Showtime series was ahead of its time in its portrayal of LGBTQ people on television. Based on a British series of the same time, “Queer as Folk” continues to resonate among many viewers even though it went off the air in 2005. As Entertainment Weekly noted in its LGBTQ issue last month, the show ― which starred Gale Harold, Randy Harrison and Hal Sparks as a trio of gay men living in Pittsburgh ― has enjoyed a second life among younger, binge-watching audiences on streaming services. In the latest installment of his “Culture Cruise” video series, Seattle-based writer Matt Baume breaks down a 2002 “Queer as Folk” episode simply titled “Pride” in an effort to determine whether the narrative would hold up following the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling on same-sex marriage and other LGBTQ-related social strides. As Baume discovers, many components still strike a chord. One plotline, for instance, seems to anticipate the ongoing debate over the so-called “ corporatization of Pride ” ― that is, the increasingly visible presence of consumer and retail brands at Pride parades and other queer-themed festivities. On the flip side, Baume points out that few people of color are represented throughout the episode, while the transgender community isn’t referenced at all. Then, there’s one scene in which the character of Michael (Sparks) gives an unsuspecting co-worker an open-mouthed kiss without consent ― a now-jarring moment in the wake of the Me Too and Time’s Up movements. “Through various intertwined stories, the show asks questions about Pride that the queer community is still grappling with today,” Baume told HuffPost. While the series was “able to foresee the issues we’d be grappling with today,” he added, “It’s amazing what the show completely missed.” Watch Baume’s entire episode of “Culture Cruise” above.","It's amazing to see what the iconic series predicted -- and what it completely missed, Matt Baume finds.",2018-07-04T20:49:23Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Here’s How ‘Queer As Folk’ Depicted LGBTQ Pride Back In 2002,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/queer-as-folk-pride-episode-culture-cruise_us_5b3bcd6be4b09e4a8b2827ec,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b3bce14220000a906eed297.jpeg?cache=ymkecnmk71&ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,gale,1
John Timmer,"Enlarge / The delta within Jezero Crater. 1 with 1 posters participating On Monday, NASA announced that it had chosen a landing spot for its upcoming Mars 2020 rover. The site (more or less at center here ) is called Jezero Crater, and it contains a delta formed by flowing water. NASA says that landing in its difficult terrain requires new technology that allows increased steering in the atmosphere. Mars 2020 will be based on the design of the Curiosity rover, which is currently operating in Gale Crater, but it will have a different suite of instruments. The mission will have two focuses: to give us a better perspective on whether Mars has ever hosted life and to cache rocks for a sample return mission. The details of how to get rocks back off the Red Planet are still being worked out. But there has been a steadily growing body of evidence that Mars had large amounts of liquid water on its surface in the distant past, and Mars 2020 will be about sampling some of what that water left behind in order to determine if it could have hosted lifeforms similar to those on Earth. Some of that evidence indicates that the northern part of the planet once hosted an ocean. While Jezero Crater isn't far enough north to be in that basin, it's on the edge of where some volcanic highlands drop off into it. Imaging from orbit suggests that water flowing down from those highlands carved a path through the crater wall and formed a delta as it spread out within the crater. Thus, the floor of Jezero will preserve material from its own past environment as well as material eroded away from upstream of the site. NASA has already identified clays and carbonates that would have formed when water was flowing in the crater. These features make Jezero Crater such an appealing target that this isn't even the first time that NASA has contemplated landing here. But the terrain is very complex, as it includes the uneven delta as well as boulders, pits, and areas filled with sandenough to cause its rejection in the past. The people working on the new rover, however, have added some significant capabilities to its landing system. These include the ability to adjust when the parachute opens based on its trajectory and an imaging-based navigation system that will let the landing hardware fire small jets during the descent to adjust the landing site. Combined, NASA expects that the area covered by the landing site will be cut in half compared to Curiosity 's landing earlier this decade. While Mars 2020 is obviously still in the future, Mars fans can look forward to next week's landing of InSight, which will include a seismometer to track marsquakes.",Nailing the landing will require technology developed since Curiosity 's launch.,2018-11-19T22:40:09Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",NASA picks a landing spot on Mars for its 2020 rover,https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/11/nasa-picks-a-landing-spot-on-mars-for-its-2020-rover/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jezerocrater-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,gale,1
Al Jazeera,"Snow is always newsworthy in the UK, especially when it falls on London. On Sunday morning, that is just what happened. This was not just a few flakes - train services slowly closed in the suburbs of Britain's capital, while the UK Met Office issued a warning of up to 30cm in Wales and much of central England. By 11:00 GMT, with snow still falling, 30cm was on the ground in Sennybridge, south Wales, and 15cm in the Cotswolds and the Chiltern Hills. Flights were suspended, meanwhile, at Birmingham Airport. With 11cm falling on Buckinghamshire before dawn, snow ploughs were brought out but the rate of snowfall exceeded their ability to keep roads open. To add to the risk, the snow fell onto ice in many places. This may be the first outbreak of proper snow in central Britain but in Northern Ireland it started snowing on Friday. Belfast got away with 4cm, but Lough Fea in County Tyrone, in the middle of Northern Ireland, measured 13cm. The Scottish Highlands have had white tops on and off for a while but the ski resorts are now starting to look worthy of the name. Even at sea level, snow is now lying: Aberdeen, the ""Granite City"", recorded 6cm on Saturday, a day after snow started falling. When snow is on the ground but the sky is clear, temperatures can really drop. In Aberdeen, the thermometer registered -8C on Sunday morning. Edinburgh showed -7C and Glasgow -6C in freezing fog. In contrast, south of the snow line, a howling but relatively warm wind was blowing. Gusts along the coast of south Wales and southwest England exceeded 100 kilometres per hour. This weekend saw the first real plunge of cold air in a northerly wind that will reach Morocco by Monday. As a result, 30cm of snow is possible in the Atlas Mountains and over Spain's Sierra Nevada and half a metre in the Pyrenees. Over the Alps, more than a metre is likely. The snow risk for London and southeast England lasts throughout Monday. The same weather system will bring similar amounts of snow to the Benelux countries, as well as western and northern Germany and eastern France over the next two days.","Heavy snow, freezing fog and gale force winds in the UK â€“ luckily not all in the same place.",2017-12-10T14:15:11Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",UK: First snow of the year reaches London,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/uk-snow-year-reaches-london-171210134623281.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/12/10/24cf876e0e4e498db36d436f84e8ff1d_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,gale,1
Bram Sable-Smith,"Located in Northern Wisconsin along the shores of Lake Superior, Ashland, Wis. has had enough of substance abuse issue. NorthLakes Community Clinic brought in Dr. Mark Lim to start a team providing substance abuse and mental health services. Derek Montgomery for NPR Lindsay Bunker woke up from a nightmare. The 32-year-old lives with her sixth-month-old daughter on the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation in northern Wisconsin. She's struggled with addiction for over 10 years, mostly to heroin. Then came the nightmare: She dreamt two men were attacking her baby while she could think only about drugs. ""In my mind I was thinking, 'If I can just get one hit, if I can get one line, I can save her,'"" she recalls, pausing before continuing, ""I woke up and I was panicking. How can a mother think like that?"" It was a wake-up call. Bunker says she realized in that moment that heroin was ""evil"" and she resolved to get into treatment. In a lot of rural America, that's where the story could have ended. Many rural communities lack basic resources for substance abuse. There are fewer services available than in urban areasas many as 82 percent of rural Americans may live in counties that lack detoxification services, for example. But Bunker was lucky. She found a community health center only about an hour from her home that recently expanded its addiction treatment services. The clinic, NorthLakes Community Clinic,serves Medicaid and Medicare patients, and offers sliding scale payments for those with low-income. Itexpanded its addiction recovery program with the help of state and federal grants targeting opioid use. Though rural communities across the country struggle with addiction, community health centers like this one are modeling an approach to managing and funding treatment programs. ""We were seeing substance use disorders killing our community and we felt it was our job to step up,"" says Reba Rice, the clinic's CEO. ""We feel that all of our patients and community members deserve a life worth living."" Not just opioids Rice says addiction has torn apart rural communities in Northern Wisconsin in the last five years or so, with an increase in crime, problems in schools, trauma in families. ""It was amazing how many things we were seeing changed,"" she says. ""The way people looked at each other, the level people were willing to trust each other, and it was all about the changes that this disease makes on its victims"" Lindsay Bunker (left) talks to her counselor Regina Fox (right) at the NorthLakes Community Clinic in Ashland, Wisconsin. Bunker is in treatment for heroin addiction. She says the clinic's approach is helping: ""I love being here. I feel safe. I feel strong. I feel supported."" Derek Montgomery for NPR A recent poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health shows that opioid and other drug abuse is the top health concern for rural Americans. NorthLakes has long provided primary care, dental and behavioral health services for low-income residents in Ashland, Wisconsin, and in several nearby towns. But as the opioid addiction problem worsened, Rice says she felt a responsibility as a health care provider to do something about it. ""We contributed to the problem so we needed to contribute to the solution,"" she says.Rice says opioids were just part of the puzzle: meth and alcohol were huge problems too. In fact, meth use in Wisconsin it has grown by 250 percent in recent years, according to the FBI. But new funds were becoming available for opioid treatment so the clinic applied for those and is using them to build a comprehensive addiction treatment program that addresses all the substances people there struggle with. To fund its expanded addiction treatment services, NorthLakes applied for and won a grant from the state of Wisconsin three years ago. It also got other federal grants intended for mental health and addiction. Central to their plan was hiring a physician who could lead the new program, and could prescribe the addiction treatment buprenorphine, known by the trade-name Suboxone. Suboxone treatment is one of the most effective ways to treat opioid addiction. But it is hard to find in rural areas, because only providers who've received special training are allowed to prescribe it. One 2015 study found that more than 80 percent of rural counties in the U.S. do not have a single physician able to prescribe it. NorthLakes found a physician who could prescribe it and more than that, who had a vision for a comprehensive addiction program. Building treatment capacity Dr. Mark Lim says he is surprised he's here in this 8,000 person port-town on Lake Superior. He'd dreamed of living in a big city since he moved to the U.S. from the Philippines. When he got the call about the job, he was hesitant at first. ""I didn't know where that was on a map,"" he recalls. But he saw this part of Wisconsin, where the death rate from drug and alcohol abuse is nearly twice as high as the state average, as a place where he could make a difference. Lim's been board certified in addiction medicine since it was officially recognized as a subspecialty in 2016, but he's been working in the field since about 10 years ago when he started working in an addiction practice in Maine. Dr. Mark Lim moved from Maine to become the recovery program medical director at NorthLakes Community Clinic in Ashland, Wisconsin. He wanted to set up a comprehensive practice to treat a range of addictions. Derek Montgomery for NPR He took the Wisconsin job, with one stipulation: He would start a program to address addiction as a whole. His expertise would be just one part of the treatment approach. ""If I'm just going to be the Suboxone doctor I'm not doing the full practice of addiction,"" Lim says. Because while the medication can be effective for treating opioid use disorder, Lim says addiction is not just about opioids. ""Opioids are big right now,"" Lim says. ""But you have to work with alcohol too. You have to work with marijuana too. You have to work with methamphetamine, cocaine."" Rice says she and Lim developed the program together with community partners including educators, law enforcement and tribal leadership. ""We were successful because we had a vision for creating a program and so did he,"" Rice says. While it's rare to have a doctor who can prescribe Suboxone in a rural area like this one, Lim says only about 40 of his more than 200 patients take it. For the rest, his program relies on a combination of counseling, group therapy for addiction and underlying mental health issues, and case management. Staff help to remove barriers to being successful in recovery, helping patients with things like, transportation to the clinic, daycare for parents during therapy, and even job placements. This kind of recovery program that combines clinical and counseling services is exactly what rural communities need, says John Gale of the Maine Rural Health Research Center. ""That's exactly the way it should be done. Because most people with a substance use disorder have co-occurring mental health and substance use problems,"" Gale says. ""If we take care of [a patient's] heroin problems and we don't treat the underlying mental health and substance abuse problems, they're going to go to go to alcohol, they're going to do something else."" And while most of the attention and dollars are focused on opioid abuse right now, he says rural communities struggling to address addiction can use those resources to build a larger treatment capacity. ""They can use [those resources] to say, 'Wait a minute, let's build a treatment capacity for other people,' "" Gale says. ""And they begin to create a community where you can treat all sorts of substance use disorders."" Lindsay Bunker gets a ride to and from the NorthLakes clinic from a medical transportation company it's about an hour's drive each way from the reservation. The clinic has a baby sitter who looks after her daughter when Bunker is in appointments. She makes the trip nearly every day. ""I love being here. I feel safe. I feel strong. I feel supported,"" Bunker says. But she only sees Dr. Lim about once a week. Instead, like all of the patients here, she spends most of her time in one-on-one and group counseling sessions. There's the early relapse prevention group (from which Bunker recently graduated), then there's the relapse recovery group, the family group, the engaged-in-recovery group. There'll be a trauma group soon as well. Bunker says those group sessions are really important in helping her stay in recovery. ""I get cravings and the cravings are being taken away with that medicine [suboxone]. But being here with my peers, I love it. I really do,"" Bunker says. And she says, recovery agrees with her. ""I look good, I feel good, I'm taking care of my kid,"" she says. ""I'm doing very well.""

Cory Doctorow,"Since the 2008 financial crisis, the ""sovereign citizen"" movement/conspiracy theory (previously) has grown by leaps and bounds, thanks to a combination of the rise of antisemitism (long a dogwhistle in the movement, now out in the open), an increase in financial desperation and a sense of betrayal, and the movement's ability to realize real cash for its members, who have systematically defrauded the underfunded and resource-strapped IRS of move than $1B.
Ashley Powers' long New York Times profile of movement leader Sean David Morton and his wife, Melissa Thomson, is a fascinating and chilling tour through the rise of a weaponized conspiracy movement with a business-model, a grift that sucks in people from the UFO believer circuit and other fringe nodes with promises of ""debt relief"" that turn out to be advice on how to defraud the government and a secret history of a cabal of Jewish bankers who are responsible for all of America's woes.
This secret history is like a prototype for Qanon and other far-right conspiracy movements, alleging that a bankrupt business somehow mortgaged every US citizen for $630,000 to the US government, and that this led to the establishment of the Social Security Administration (this is the most coherent part of the theory -- it only gets stupider from here on out). ""Sovereign Citizens"" believe that they can speak certain words or phrases, or point out certain alleged defects in the formalities of their courtrooms (for example, whether or not a flag has gold fringe) and that these act as incantations that neutralize the power of the state.
Believers also profess a solemn duty to defraud the US government and to that end they file I099-OID IRS forms with fraudulent claims for tax returns; they also issue fake bonds that they use to defraud the IRS. The starved and weakened IRS only catches a fraction of these (thought to amount to at least $1B in total), and when they do, believers say that they didn't realize they were breaking the law -- only exploiting ""tax loopholes"" like rich people do.
The movement has grown rapidly since the financial crisis, trading on the correct, widespread public perception that the finance industry is corrupt, that it deliberately trashed the US economy, and that it was bailed out at taxpayer expense afterwards.
The sovereign citizen movement has two prongs that attract new members: financial fraud and heavy militarization; sovereign citizens are to be found throughout the far-right militia movement, and are America's top domestic terror threat, and are prolific murderers of police officers.
Wherever armed, far-right terrorists are to be found, so too are sovereign citizens -- they're intermeshed with Cliven Bundy and his terrorist group. They also have historic and current ties to quack nutrition/health schemes, the John Birch Society, and UFO conspiracy movements.
This kind of nuttery has been around forever, but Powers skillfully demonstrates how inequality, the finance crisis, and financial desperation has supercharged the movement, bringing in vulnerable, scared people who know that rich people really do have secret ways of getting a better deal than anyone else, and who are ripe for being suckered with promises from con-artists who claim to have discovered those incantations. The sunsetting of the IRS's enforcement arm -- which started with the financial crisis and the Tea Party's war on the IRS based on the false story that it conspired against right-wing ""non-profits"" -- has only led credence to the movement's claims, because people really do get rich by following its fraud advice, and generally get away with it.
The founder of the antigovernment group Posse Comitatus, Mr. Gale aligned himself with an emerging movement of tax protesters who argued, for instance, that paying taxes was a form of involuntary servitude. In turn, he introduced them to his warped version of America, where patriots establish their own legal system and hang those who defy it. Mr. Gales specific gift was wrapping nonsense in enough legalese that it sounded real. If you have this movement that offers you essentially a lot of magic words that you can say to get out of trouble, thats going to really appeal to people who are desperate and angry, Mr. Berger said. Mr. Gales outreach was a success. Over time, the line between thousands of tax protesters and Posse members blurred.
Take redemption a theory popularized, in part, by a Gale associate. Remember how the corporation-slash-fake-government used us as collateral? According to sovereign lore, this means the government set up secret accounts in our names. Some believe they contain the oddly specific amount of $630,000. (To be clear, this is pure fantasy, according to the Internal Revenue Service.)
One way sovereigns try to make the imaginary money real is by abusing legitimate I.R.S. forms. Law-abiding taxpayers use Form 1099-OID, for example, to report original issue discount income. But some sovereigns write in fake OID income, and fake withholding, in order to claim illegitimate refunds. If you file such a return, you risk at the very least a large fine. Yet from 2012 to 2014, according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the I.R.S. received close to 7,000 sham OID filings.

Fred Topel,"Gale Anne Hurd is one of most successful producers in Hollywood. She launched the Terminator franchise, gave Alien its first sequel, and currently oversees the W alking Dead universe on television. Like any woman in Hollywood, especially coming up in the 80s, Hurd has her own stories of sexism too. She shared some at a Screamfest Q&amp;A before she was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite the success of The Terminator, her second studio film was full of battles. When Fox agreed that Jim would direct Aliens, I had to go in and interview, Hurd said. The first question I was asked was, How can a little girl like you produce a big movie like this? Ive never been a really shy, retiring type. It was all I could do to just sit there, not walk out and say, Why dont you check my reference. Hurd had references. She cut her teeth under Roger Corman, and worked with Film Finance for the completion bond on The Terminator. Then I said, In fact, even better, Ill have them call you, Hurd continued. So when the head of Film Finances in Los Angeles [Lindsley Parsons] called, Roger [Corman] called and various other people called saying, Not only can she do this, youd be lucky to have her, I got the job, but I earned it. Getting the job wasnt the end of Hurds struggles though. Aliens filmed at the legendary Pinewood Studios in England, where crews were still surprised a woman was producing the movie. Then I went to England to make Aliens and honestly I felt like I was in The Wizard of Oz, Hurd said. People kept saying, Whos really behind the curtain? Whos really producing this movie? Once again, it was someone having my back. Once Aliens was in production, the head of 20th Century Fox in the U.K. didnt even want to deal with people doubting Hurd. There was a gentleman who headed up Fox in the U.K., the late Tim Hampton, Hurd said. Anyone who called him hed say, No, Gales producing the movie. No, you cant call me. Im not producing the movie. Honestly, people would argue with him. No, come on, Tim, youre producing the movie. No, Im not and if Gales not going to hire you, youre not getting hired. The response surprised Hurd, particularly in England, where she thought society was more progressive than in the States. I thought it was crazy because Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister of England at the time, Hurd said. I thought they were a lot more advanced. They werent, not in film. After Aliens, Hurd had another reason to worry about her career. She had been married to Cameron, and when they divorced she feared the industry would take sides, and side with the director of the hit blockbuster films. Jim and I were getting divorced and it could have been a business where people basically said, Eh, were going to close the door and youre going to be an outsider, and I actually got an overall deal with Fox, Hurd said. Thats pretty remarkable. There were a lot of people who believed Id earned my stripes. The above is the worst things got for Hurd. As even more abusive behavior towards women in the industry has come to light in the last year, Hurd hopes everyone in the movie business will work together and support each other. I think weve seen a lot of really bad behavior, Hurd said. Ive never tolerated it on my sets. On my sets, Ive never seen a MeToo moment, but its really time to have each others backs. Women, men, gender fluid, you name it, lets try to be a lot more inclusive in our business because weve not done a very good job with that in the past.

Reuters Editorial,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Energy companies on Monday halted nearly a fifth of Gulf of Mexico oil production and evacuated staff from 10 platforms as Hurricane Michael intensified and headed for a path up the eastern U.S. part of the Gulf. BHP Billiton, BP, Equinor and Exxon Mobil Corp were evacuating personnel from oil and gas platforms in the Gulf as forecasters predicted the storm would become a Category 3 hurricane. Companies turned off the daily production flow of 324,190 barrels of oil and nearly 284 million cubic feet of natural gas at midday, according to a survey of producers. Five drilling rigs also were moved out of the storm’s path, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. U.S. oil prices ended mostly flat as traders discounted the impact of the storm. Crude futures on Monday settled at $74.29, down 5 cents. The storm is expected to intensify into a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 111 to 129 miles (178 to 208 km) per hour and bring heavy seas to producing areas in the central Gulf of Mexico. The storm’s current path takes it away from refinery-heavy areas. BHP Billiton said it was shutting-in production and evacuated staff at two platforms while BP shut in production at four platforms. The platforms evacuating personnel and shutting in production include BHP’s Shenzi and Neptune and BP’s Atlantis, Mad Dog, Na Kika and Thunder Horse facilities, the companies said. Norwegian state oil firm Equinor also evacuated its Titan production platform and Exxon removed staff from its Lena production platform, the companies said. Exxon said it did not expect the staff reduction to affect output. Hess Corp, Royal Dutch Shell and Anadarko Petroleum Corp said they were monitoring the storm and would take action as needed. Shell was securing some drilling operations on Monday but facilities were still staffed and operating, spokeswoman Kimberly Windon said. The storm’s intensity is being fed by warm sea surface temperatures and a lack of upper-level windshear, said forecasters. Those conditions should result in 15- to 20-foot waves, “enough to be disruptive of oil production operations” west of the storm track, said John Tharp, operations supervisor at Weather Decision Technologies. Shipping ports, including Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida, were open on Monday, but the U.S. Coast Guard warned of gale-force winds in the next 48 hours. Offshore production in the Gulf accounts for 17 percent of total U.S. crude oil output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Natural gas production from Gulf offshore operations provides 5 percent of the U.S. total. Over 45 percent of U.S. refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, along with 51 percent of the nation’s natural gas processing plant capacity, the EIA said.

Special CorrespondentTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM,"Whipped up by cyclonic storm Ockhi lurking off the coast, heavy rain and gale-force winds pummelled the southern parts of the State since Thursday morning, wreaking widespread havoc and bringing normal life to a halt. Squally winds uprooted hundreds of trees, snapped power and communication lines, toppled hoardings, destroyed houses and damaged crops across the southern districts. A holiday was declared for schools and colleges. Roads were flooded in many places, slowing down traffic. A couple were electrocuted at Kattakada after they came into contact with a live electric line. Another person was crushed to death under a falling tree at Vizhinjam. The Air Force and Navy deployed aircraft, helicopters and ships to search and rescue 150 fishermen reported missing after setting out to sea from Thiruvananthapuram. Train services between Kollam Junction and Kanyakumari were cancelled or rescheduled due to disruption of overhead traction supply caused by falling trees. Thiruvananthapuram district bore the brunt of the storm. The district administration began preparing to evacuate families from the vulnerable areas along the coast. In an emergency videoconferencing, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan directed Collectors in the southern districts to remain alert and coordinate government agencies for rescue and relief work. A cyclone alert issued by the India Met Department has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over South Kerala till Friday noon. Gale-force winds are also likely along and off South Kerala during the next 48 hours. The bulletin said Cyclone Ochki was expected to cause damages in Alappuzha, Kottayam, Idukki, Kollam, Pathanamthitta and Thiruvananthapuram districts. The system which originated as a depression near the Sri Lanka coast on Wednesday intensified into a deep depression south east of Kanyakumari at 5.30 a.m. on Thursday and further strengthened into a cyclonic storm which lay centred 120 km southeast off Thiruvananthapuram. By evening, the storm was packing gale-speed winds up to 70 to 75 kmph gusting up to 85 kmph. A press note issued by the IMD said the system was set to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by Friday morning. Weathermen are closely tracking the path of the cyclone which is estimated to move in a west northwest direction towards the Lakshadweep islands. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services has also warned of rough sea conditions with high waves of 3 m to 4.2 m height till Friday noon along the Kerala coast from Vizhinjam to Kasaragod and along the Lakshdweep coast from Minicoy to Bitra. Fishermen in South Kerala and Lakshadweep Islands have been directed not to venture out to sea during the next 48 hours.","State on high alert as IMD forecasts heavy rain, gale-force winds in next 48 hours",2017-11-30T14:26:29Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Cyclone Ockhi wreaks havoc in S Kerala,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cyclone-ockhi-wreaks-havoc-in-s-kerala/article21235144.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,the-hindu,The Hindu,gale,1
David Fear,"In February of 1964, you could see it everywhere you looked — in high school hallways, diners and malt shops, your local record store (definitely in your local record store). It started with a cold sweats and clammy palms; later symptoms also included screaming, swooning, heart palpitations, a burning desire to sing about not wanting to dance with another (wooo) and the inability to control your bladder. It was called Beatlemania, and when the boys from Liverpool with their funny haircuts touched down at JFK airport, the epidemic was just about to hit its zenith. They arrived in America with the intention of playing on The Ed Sullivan Show. And four young women from New Jersey were determined to see the band perform on that stage, live and in person, come hell or high water.
Released in early 1978, I Wanna Hold Your Hand followed a quartet of teens named Pam, Janis, Grace and Rosie who go to extraordinary lengths to get within shrieking distance of Paul, John, George and Ringo. The misadventures of this not-quite-so-fab four would involve others, including a few smitten guys, a kid dodging his authoritarian dad, a Beatles superfan named Ringo Klaus and a Garden State greaser who couldn’t see what the big fuss over these Brits was all about. It was the sort of manic, madcap comedy that rarely let you catch your breath, whipping up a combination of burgeoning boomer nostalgia and go-for-broke slapstick. It managed to be both an innocent look back at a gamechanging moment in pop culture and a reminder that raging hormones helped fuel this phenomena. “You’ll believe a man can fly” boasted a different spirit-of-’78 movie; I Wanna Hold Your Hand may be the only film of the decade that could make you believe that greasily fondling a Rickenbacker bass can be a risqué sexual act.
It was the perfect introduction to the filmmaking team of Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, who’d go on to give the world Used Cars (1980) and the Back to the Future trilogy. (You can see the duo workshopping a few Future elements here, from a character telling a creep to “get your damned hands” off a young woman to a key plot point involving someone being hit by lightning.) And while it may not the final word on the fever of Beatlemania, the movie does capture that moment in time when four guys in suits who had some jaunty tunes could inspire riots. “I want you to be prepared for excessive screaming, hysteria, hyperventilation, fainting, fits, seizures, spasmodic convulsions … even attempted suicides,” Ed Sullivan tells his ushers before the show. “All perfectly normal.”
A Hard Day’s Night Reborn: Behind the Restoration
In honor of a new Criterion DVD/Blu-ray being released this week, Zemeckis and Gale reminisced about making their debut feature, the perils of trying to make a movie about the Beatles when you aren’t allowed to show them and how they pulled off recreating that classic Sullivan show performance.
How’d this movie come about?Bob Gale: We were sitting in my apartment one night, listening to a Beatles album — one of the really early ones. We started reading the liner notes on the back of the album, and it mentioned this thing called “Beatlemania.”
Robert Zemeckis: It was that moment where people were trying to do things like trying to crash the Plaza Hotel when the band was staying there and buying scraps of bedsheets they’d slept on … you can see the sort of fervor they were inspiring in A Hard Day’s Night. When they first came to America, it was like that times 100.
BG: We started talking about how crazy everybody was in 1964 about the band, and we both sort of simultaneously came up with this idea of making a movie about girls waiting in line to see the Beatles. You could have done it as a play, I guess — Waiting for Godot but at a concert! But that was the original idea: Could you make a movie in which the whole thing took place with just people waiting in line?
RZ: We’d been impressed by American Graffiti, which has this really intricate screenplay that cuts between these four characters that are involved in parallel stories happening on the same night. We thought, why couldn’t we do this with Beatlemania? It’s four girls, four stories, it all takes place in one day. That was the idea.
BG: We’re big fans of what Bob has called “bottle movies,” where you have stories that take place in a very limited amount of time and/or space. Graffiti is sort of like that, although it also has the structure of a Shakespearean comedy:  You have all of your characters at the beginning, they all get separated and then they all end up together at the end.
RZ: Our pitch was always, “It’s American Graffiti meets Ben-Hur.“
BG: You never saw Jesus’s face in Ben-Hur.
RZ: And you wouldn’t see the Beatles’ faces — just the boots, shadows, voices. Everyone sort of got it immediately.
You could have called it Beatle-Hur.RZ: Except we couldn’t use the word “Beatle” in the title. At all.
BG: We’d planned on calling it Beatlemania, but the Broadway show was just coming out and they’d taken it. It was the show where you had four guys onstage pretending to be the Beatles and playing their songs — “not imitators but an incredible simulation.” The lawyers made then put that on the poster.
RZ: Then when we couldn’t use that title because of the stage show, it was going to be Beatles 4-Ever.” Then we were told, “No, you can’t have the word Beatle in any way, shape or form.” It got bogged down in the studio legal department.
BG: We pitched it in ’76, and honestly, it was one of the easiest pitches ever. When Bob and I came up with this idea, we thought, ok, the way to get this thing off the ground was to pitch to female producers. We talked to Alex [Rose] and Tamara [Asseyev], and they got it instantly. We had a strong female contingent on our side; even then, the idea of making a female-centric movie was considered a really good idea by a lot of folks. It just took a while for the rest of the industry to come around. A long while.
We originally pitched this to Warners, and the studio correctly noted that they wouldn’t make a development deal on the script until they could secure the rights to those early Beatles songs. Because they knew that without the music, there was nothing there. That process took about eight or nine months.
RZ: Remember, the songs we use are only from the first two albums. Just up to February 1964 — we wanted to be accurate.
BG: And this was long before Michael Jackson bought the rights to the Beatles catalog.
RZ: Eventually, thanks to Steven Spielberg, we were able to the movie going at Universal. We were lucky in that we landed at a place where the songs that we needed were the ones that were controlled by Capitol Records, I think. So the actual Beatles estate didn’t have complete control of these songs. For some reason, the label decided to sell the mechanical and publishing to Universal, which was how we got them. I think there was one song from Meet the Beatles that studio wasn’t able to get, but yeah, that was how we were able to get this done.
BG: Bob Zemeckis and I went to Mobile, Alabama, where Steven was shooting Close Encounters of the Third Kind. He wanted us to do more rewrites on 1941; that was going to be his next picture. And just as we setting up the changes that Steven wanted us to do, we got the call that we’d finally cleared the music rights. “Could you guys come back to L.A. and start working on the first draft of Beatlemania ASAP?” At that time, the movie was still called Beatlemania.
BG: The way we write, it’s us sitting around in a room and throwing a lot of ideas around. We knew we needed to open it up from just kids waiting in line for tickets. Ok, so, we have to have the girl who’s completely out of her mind: That’s Rosie (Wendie Jo Sperber). We have to have the guy who hates the Beatles, because that was part of the whole thing: That’s Tony (Bobby Di Cicco). We were fixated on the idea that there was this intersection of rock music and folk music and protest music, and we wanted a character that had an epiphany about how revolutionary the band was: That was Janice (Susan Kendall Newman.) In our minds, the Beatles really represented the start of the youth counterculture. We’re making a movie about this important cultural event, and we need to note that it wasn’t just goofy, loud music. It was a harbinger of something more.
They also took on the tight-ass Sixties establishment, so we came up with a character that was liberated from that because of the Beatles: Pam (Nancy Allen). And we needed to have a motor for the story, so we came up with Grace (Theresa Saldana), who needs to get to the Beatles for her own selfish reasons, and ends up being one who naturally ends up sacrificing everything for the greater good.
RZ: There weren’t a lot of young actresses at that point who were big names that we could get. I mean, Nancy Allen had done Carrie at that point, but that was it. Wendy Jo Sperber hadn’t done Bosom Buddies yet; I think this was the very first thing she did. She might have been 16, which meant we could only film her for four hours or so a day, so I’m pretty sure she lied about her age to get the part. And there was nobody that could have measured up to Eddie Deezen. He was perfect for the part of Klaus Ringo. Just look at him.
BG: Even in 1977, there was still a tremendous amount of extreme Beatles fandom happening. There were Beatles memorabilia conventions happening on a fairly regular basis. I remember connecting with folks at a few of these, and I think the Beatles talcum powder we used in the movie was the real thing … we borrowed it from one of the fans. And then later, he got pissed off at how much we used in the scene with Eddie. [Laughs] “Hey, that’s actual Beatles powder! Don’t waste it!” Sorry, kid. All bets are off when you deal with those weirdos from Hollywood.
RZ: We wanted to start filming at the Plaza Hotel, where the Beatles stayed before their first Ed Sullivan appearance. but then it wasn’t going to work with our budget. Remember, this was our first movie.
BG: We actually scouted it as a possible set. And they just went, “You want to do what? With how many extras? We already went through this once with the real Beatles, and once was enough!” Also it would have been a huge expense to film it in New York anyway
RZ: So we had to make I Wanna Hold Your Hand in L.A. Which is ironic, because it used to be a lot cheaper to make a movie in Los Angeles and now, forget it. It’d be cheaper to film at the Plaza Hotel today than build a set on a studio backlot in Burbank.
BG: To me, there are three scenes that really stand out to me, and that prove that Zemeckis really understood the vocabulary of movies right out of the gate: he scene in the barbershop; the scene with Nancy Allen is in the Beatles hotel room, hiding under the bed; and the climax, where we used the monitors and the actors to make you think you were watching the Beatles on Ed Sullivan’s stage.
How’d you guys pull that sequence off?RZ: That’s an interesting story. So we were told by the Universal folks that, apparently, we would have no problem getting the actual Sullivan footage — CBS told the studio, “Yeah, sure, you can use the footage. It will cost you X amount of money. But you have to get permission from the Beatles and indemnify us from any legal action they might take against us.” Well, immediately, Universal’s legal team is like, “No way, you can’t use any footage. We are talking about the Beatles. We would get sued by people who have enough money to win.”
BG: We actually had lawyers tell us, “If you make the movie, you can’t show the Beatles at all — no likenesses, stock footage, anything.” We had to show them storyboards for how we were going to not show the Beatles. They’re lawyers — they don’t have imaginations. All they know is there’s a girl in the Beatles’ hotel room, and in the script it says you only see their legs. But they don’t know how to read a script. They don’t get it.
So we storyboarded the hotel room scene for them. And we storyboarded the scene where Nancy Allen is hiding in the closet and then go down the service elevator, and you can only see the backs of their heads. All good. But when it came to the Sullivan show, they were adamant that we only show the audience.
Bob and I went to go have dinner, and we’re thinking to ourselves: We’re building up to this big, iconic concert for the whole movie, and if we don’t show it, the audience is going to burn down the theater! Is it irresponsible for us as filmmakers for us to have all four of these musicians we’d hired play and not film any of it? Or are we never going to get the chance to make another movie if we don’t do what we’re being asked? The latter argument won out.
RZ: We actually shot the entire scene with just the audience — you saw the crowd going nuts and you could hear the music, but we never cut to the stage. We’d assembled the movie to play that way. So then we showed the movie to [Universal President] Sid Sheinberg, who was this great, old-school studio-system maverick, and he goes [affects old-timer studio executive work], “Guys, guys, guys, this just doesn’t work!”
BG: We reminded them that we had written the script that way in the first place. He turned to us and went, “You know, you guys are right. We can’t release the movie like this. We need to pay off the Beatles.” We gave us his permission and another week to got redo it.
 RZ: “You gotta see the band! Go back and shoot that.” I said, “Well, what about the Beatles taking you to court?” And he said, “Well, at least we’d have them in the same room! That’s worth a lawsuit, don’t you think?
BG: “I’ll tell the legal department, fuck ’em — if the Beatles wanna sue us, let them! I’ll have the movie rights to having the Beatles together again in a courtroom.” A year or so after the movie had come out, Tamara Asseyev had lunch or dinner with Ringo Starr’s manager at the time. And he told her, “We all watched your movie and decided we would not sue.” By we, she interpreted that all of the Beatles had, in fact, seen the movie. I told this to Sid and he said, “What could they have sued us for? On what grounds? It’s a love letter to the Beatles! All this could do would sell more records for them.”
Yellow Submarine at 50: Why the Psychedelic Animated Beatles Movie Is Timeless
RZ: We shot all of that performance footage in one day. I don’t think we had time to do many takes; we didn’t have time to screw around. We had there four guys who were Beatle fanatics … they just studied and studied the footage. They knew exactly how the Beatles held the picks for each guitar. We knew they were going to do those three songs, so they rehearsed it to death. By the time we shot, they had every tiny movement from the Sullivan performance down pat.
BG: I don’t know if you remember Leave It to Beaver, but in the later seasons, there was this character named Richard who was always getting Beaver into trouble. He was played by an actor named Rich Correll, and this guys was a huge Beatles fan — almost as big a fan as Eddie Deezen’s character. We hired him to choreograph the Ed Sullivan sequence. He was like a drill sergeant with these guys, getting them to mimic everything that happens in that performance.
RZ: The other interesting thing about that sequence is that I Wanna Hold Your Hand is one off the first movies to ever have video footage seamlessly synced up with the shutter of the camera. Every time you shot a video screen prior to 1977, you saw what they call a “shutter bar” — those rolling lines you’d see on old TV screens — but they’d finally come up with technology to fix that. We were one of the first movies to end up using it. So we made history. Sort of.
BG: About a month ago, they pulled a DCP of this new restored version and were showing at U.C. Santa Barbara, as part of this Beatles-oriented film festival. So Nancy Allen and I went up there to speak — it was great to see it with an audience again. They were a handful of people who had not only seen the film but knew it really well. But there were a lot of young people who’d never seen the film, and they couldn’t believe the hysteria surrounding the band.
RZ: If nothing else, the movie was a testament to Beatlemania. And, y’know, still is.
BG: That scene where the woman says she’s going to married to John, and she’s reminded that John is already married, then replies, “Well, his wife could die” — everyone thought we were exaggerating stuff like that.

Elijah Nouvelage,"CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - Heavy rains are forecast to begin on Wednesday in northern California, where they are likely to hinder search teams sifting through ash and rubble for the remains of victims of the deadliest wildfire in the state’s history. As much as six inches (15 cm) of rain was expected to fall over the next several days around the town of Paradise, a community of nearly 27,000 people, many of them retirees, that was largely obliterated by the Camp Fire. The fire claimed at least 81 lives and left hundreds missing. The storm will help firefighters still battling the blaze, but will create more misery to the thousands of residents left homeless by the disaster, which destroyed thousands of homes in and around Paradise. Some of the homeless are camping rather than staying in emergency shelters. “There are people still living in tents,” Sacramento-based NWS meteorologist Eric Kurth said in a telephone interview. “That’s certainly not going to be pleasant with the rain, and we might get some wind gusting up to 40 to 45 miles per hour (64 to 72 km per hour).” Forecasters said the rains might also cause rivers of mud and debris to slide down flame-scorched slopes stripped of vegetation. The fire has burned across 151,000 acres (61,107 hectares) of the Sierra foothills north of San Francisco. But because of mass evacuations since the fire erupted on Nov. 8, few people were believed to be in harm’s way from any debris flow, according to National Weather Service (NWS) hydrologist Cindy Matthews. She also said the volcanic soil and relatively shallow slopes found in the fire zone mean the ground is unlikely to become saturated enough for hillsides to give way to landslides. However, authorities in Southern California warned residents in areas burned by another pair of wildfires in the foothills and mountains northwest of Los Angeles to be wary of mud-flow hazards from the same storm this week. One of those blazes, the Woolsey Fire, killed three people. MORE VICTIMS The remains of two more victims were found in a structure in Paradise on Tuesday, raising the death toll to 81. The Butte County Sheriff’s Office has tentatively identified 56 of the victims whose remains have so far been recovered. Meanwhile, the missing-persons list compiled by the sheriff’s office was revised to 870 names late on Tuesday, from a high of more than 1,200 over the weekend. The number has fluctuated widely over the past week as more individuals were reported missing and some initially unaccounted for either turned up alive or were confirmed dead. The number of residents needing temporary shelter was unclear, but as many as 52,000 people were under evacuation orders at the height of the firestorm last week. The Camp Fire incinerated some 12,600 homes in and around Paradise, mostly during the first night of the blaze. Gale-force winds drove flames through drought-parched scrub and trees into the town with little warning, forcing residents to flee for their lives. Buffer lines have been carved around 75 percent of the fire’s perimeter and full containment is expected by the end of the month, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Smoke from the fires has drifted across the country to the East Coast, where it left a brownish-orange haze that was credited with unusually vibrant sunsets on Monday. The cause of the Camp and Woolsey fires is under investigation, but electric utilities reported equipment problems around the time both blazes broke out.

Rebecca Fishbein,"I have seen the 2001 motion picture film Head Over Heels, and so I understand that it is very difficult to be a model. It appears time has not made this easier, or so I learned from the plight of one Victorias Secret model, who found herself at an In-N-Out last week and ate nary an Animal Style fry. Indeed, according to Today.com, on Wednesday model Kelly Gale posted a series of videos to her Instagram Story at an In-N-Out Burger in Monterey, California. Now, if I were in In-N-Out-blessed California and not sad, In-N-Out-devoid New York, I too would document my experience on social media. But Kelly Gale and I are different people, and her videos did not show her shoving a Double Double down her throat at an alarming speed. Instead, they showed her jumping rope outside the establishment and eating a very sad-looking pear. Were at In-N-Out? So I guess Im having my pear, Gale says in one video, captioning a photo of the In-N-Out sign with Not gonna pretend that I eat here guys cause I dont, in another. The videos sparked some backlash, with folks pointing out that mocking people at a fast food joint is a liiiiiiittle bit (i.e., extremely) body shame-y. And considering Victorias Secrets longstanding issues with size-inclusivity (among other things), this isnt a great look. Still, I feel for Gale, who went all the way to an In-N-Out only to do an exercise and eat a fruit. And not just any fruit, but a pear, which is arguably the most boring fruit of all. Youre in California, at least have a damn avocado.","I have seen the 2001 motion picture film Head Over Heels, and so I understand that it is very difficult to be a model.

JOSE A. DEL REAL,"In poor areas of the city, where people are more likely to depend on walking and cycling as the sole means of transportation, residents complain of a disregard for their well-being by drivers who treat their neighborhood streets like highways. City data shows that the dangers to pedestrians and cyclists are particularly acute in South Los Angeles — where Mr. Frazier was killed — which lags the rest of the city in safety infrastructure. “Once they see people on bicycles, they think it’s like a homeless person or someone who’s getting to work on their bike because they can’t afford a car,” said Edin Barrientos, who lives in South Los Angeles and founded a cycling group. “And I think that’s why there’s a lot of hostility around here. Drivers and the public don’t see a cyclist’s life as valuable, especially here.” City officials have celebrated a modest fall in traffic deaths overall in recent years. But in South Los Angeles, pedestrian and cyclist deaths have jumped sharply. Bicycle-involved collisions increased in all divisions of the Los Angeles Police Department’s South Bureau, up about 25 percent from this time a year ago, though some areas have seen sharper increases. In year-to-date comparisons between 2017 and 2018, bicycle-involved collisions in the Southeast division of South Los Angeles have increased 70 percent. Photo In the aftermath of Mr. Frazier’s death, other cyclists are attempting to mobilize politically. Credit Megan Miller for The New York Times A subculture of riding groups has emerged as cycling has become more common, including Chief Lunes, the group that Mr. Barrientos founded about five years ago and that counted Mr. Frazier as a member. Like other such groups, it is loosely organized around “night rides,” weekly or bi-weekly gatherings where cyclists ride en masse. The groups are bound by their enthusiasm for bikes, but also by the assurance of safety in numbers. In the aftermath of Mr. Frazier’s death, other cyclists are attempting to mobilize politically, under the name “Woon Justice for South L.A.” Hundreds of cyclists across Los Angeles have joined in protests and vigils, and many are working to change city policy involving the protection of cyclists. “We keep hearing, every week, about people getting run over or hit,” Mr. Barrientos said. “And the city isn’t doing anything, the law isn’t doing anything, and the public isn’t doing anything. So who is going to step up?” Spencer Sims, a member of Chief Lunes, said “Woon Justice for South LA” had focused on the specific goal of getting a bike lane installed on Manchester Avenue, where Mr. Frazier was killed. The group has other goals: To petition for questions about cyclists on driving tests and to eventually start a legal defense network to connect cyclists and pedestrians who are hurt by reckless drivers. “We don’t want other people to die. And there are people dying on their bikes all the time that aren’t part of any community so they don’t get any support. And we want to be able to be the voice for that,” Mr. Sims said. Between 2013 and 2017, 489 pedestrians and cyclists were killed by cars across Los Angeles, according to data provided by the city, numbers that have remained stubbornly high. Photo Riders in Los Angeles have organized to try to push through safety improvements for bikers. Credit Megan Miller for The New York Times In his response. the mayor, Eric Garcetti, introduced a plan called “Vision Zero” in 2015. City officials have put considerable work into identifying high-risk roads, noting that 6 percent of L.A.’s streets account for 65 percent of pedestrian and cyclist deaths. The city has touted the work they have done in the two years since the program began. So far, 11,000 safety improvements ranging from crosswalks to pedestrian rescue islands have been installed. “I can empathize and understand the frustration that things aren’t moving fast enough. But we are delivering projects, we have a phased approach to our delivery,” said Nat Gale, principal project coordinator at the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. Activists have accused city leaders of failing to show political will amid resistance to road safety improvements; they have also questioned the implementation of Vision Zero. When signed, the program set an ambitious goal to reduce deaths 20 percent by 2017; instead, traffic deaths were down 3 percent. “You’ve got these Vision Zero ideas and plans, but when it comes time to implementing anything, nothing happens,” said Mr. Sims, whose knee was severely injured after being hit by a car in January — also hit and run. Ted Rogers, a well-known member of the cycling community who has a popular blog, said that he was rooting for Vision Zero to succeed but had been disappointed by the city. “I’ve been a Garcetti supporter for years, going back to when he was on City Council,” Mr. Rogers said, “and he has totally lost me in the last couple years because of this.” Photo Cyclists have accused city leaders of failing to show the political will to make riding safer amid resistance to road safety improvements. Credit Megan Miller for The New York Times “I am confident that without our efforts, things would be even worse,” Mr. Garcetti said earlier this year. He said the city’s transportation department would ramp up advertising related to road safety. Mr. Frazier’s friends in Chief Lunes stressed that they are advocating for simple solutions “so Woon’s death isn’t a waste.” They said pedestrian and bike deaths often go unnoticed and their mission extends beyond Mr. Frazier. “Woon had a family. Woon had the bike community behind him, that’s why it got so much attention,” Mr. Barrientos said. “Other people who might be homeless or immigrants getting to work, they have no one.” Police arrested Mariah Kandise Banks, 23, in early June in connection with Mr. Frazier’s death after a monthslong search. The Los Angeles Police Department said Ms. Banks admitted to hitting Mr. Frazier, and she fled the scene and painted the car black in an effort to avoid arrest. At a vigil the day after Mr. Frazier’s death, bicyclists gathered at the intersection where he was killed, blocking traffic and angering drivers. One, in a tan Honda Accord, ignored a red light, and hit Quatrell Stallings, who had been attempting to defuse tensions, according to witnesses, throwing him into the air. Mr. Stallings was hospitalized with severe injuries. Mr. Rogers, whose BikingInLA blog is an unofficial cyclist safety watchdog, said impediments to safety improvements came back to drivers feeling that sharing the road with cyclists and pedestrians is optional. “Drivers in L.A., they accuse bicyclists of being entitled when we want to ride safely on the street but they’re the ones that are entitled,” he said. ”They don’t want to give us an inch.” A version of this article appears in print on June 24, 2018, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Cyclists Tell Los Angeles They Need Safer Roads.

ATLANTA A Dutch man says his show dog went missing at Atlanta's airport while waiting to board a flight to Amsterdam.
Floris van Essen tells news outlets that the American Staffordshire terrier named Gale was in a crate and had gone through security with another dog about three hours before their flight was to leave. The dogs had been heading home after being shown in the U.S.
About 10 minutes before boarding, the dog's handlers were told that when workers went to load the dog's crate, they discovered it was empty.
WGCL-TV reports that KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said in a statement that the dog broke out of its cage and went missing Saturday. The airline said it is working with Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to find the dog.

Al Jazeera,"Unusually strong gale-force winds swept through Croatia's Adriatic coastline on Saturday, toppling trees, knocking out power, damaging cars and shattering windows.
The northeasterly bora wind is a cold, dry wind which blows down from the mountains on the eastern side of the Adriatic Sea.
Land, air and sea traffic were disrupted and several small wind-driven fires erupted on the central Dalmatian coast. One firefighter was slightly injured while tackling a blaze.
Croatia's weather bureau said that wind speeds in the region of the Adriatic port of Split reached 177 kilometres/hour (breaking the previous record) overnight, with gusts up to 191km/h recorded in the port town of Makarska. There were no reports of major injuries.
The areas most affected included the coastal cities of Split and Dubrovnik (winds touched 158km/h), where firefighters worked all day to clean up the debris from falling trees, overturned vehicles, and wind-swept roof tiles.
More than a dozen utility poles were knocked down, with some roads in Split closed off for fear of flying glass, tree branches, and other flying debris.

"Gabe Worgaftik on News, shared by Gabe Worgaftik to The A.V. Club","Like every aspect of the show, Saved by the Bells theme song is very much a product of its era. Its a song for lifting weights, for shoving Screech into lockers, for not attending school in a timely fashion. Oh, and it absolutely fuckin shreds. In the above video from Great Big Story, the songs delightful composer Scott Gale explains how the song came to be in all its guitar-wailing glory.
Gale, whose credits credits also include The Golden Girls and Blossom, says that producers were not bullish on the shows chances. It might make seven episodes, maybe not. That skepticism is reasonable considering that Saved by the Bell was the only series of its type at the time, a live-action sitcom wedged into a lineup of NBC Saturday morning cartoons. Hoping to fit in the rest of that lineup, the edict from the shows executive producer was that the show needed to be brash and happy and lots of color. In terms of the music, that meant rock. Given those parameters, Gale says that song took him about two minutes to write. It was the luckiest two minutes of my life.
Gales theme song would book him the gig and hed go on to compose the music for all of the shows four seasons, which evolved as story and trends required. (On the shows occasional forays into rap: We did the best we could.)
And while Gale delivered just about everything the producers were looking for in a theme, he admits there was one request he could not honor: that the shows title not be included in the theme song.
I did not get that note, says Gale.

"JON PARELES, JON CARAMANICA and GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO","“Can’t Deny Me” is the first original new Pearl Jam song in five years. Credit Mario Ruiz/Epa-Efe, via Rex/Shutterstock Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. This week, a protest song from Willie Nelson, a few unwise words from Chris Brown and a St. Patrick’s Day surprise from the Gloaming. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Pearl Jam, ‘Can’t Deny Me’ For about 40 seconds at the beginning of “Can’t Deny Me,” the first original new Pearl Jam song in five years, the band is downright itchy — Eddie Vedder trades the messianic for the agitated, the guitars are a little arrogantly lazy, the drumming is filthy. It’s bracing, a nervy and grounded protest from a band that ordinarily prefers to soar. (Pearl Jam dedicated its live performance debut of this song to the students affected by the Parkland, Fla. school shooting.) But then something like a melody arrives, and the song begins to resolve itself into something clean, plaintive, not nervous at all. A shame. JON CARAMANICA Willie Nelson, ‘Me and You’ Willie Nelson’s resilience is one of this country’s most powerful natural resources. At 84, he is as puckish as ever — a flirt and a scoundrel. The charming, vital “Me and You,” a new track from Mr. Nelson’s forthcoming album “Last Man Standing,” is a protest song masquerading as a serenade. “We are definitely outnumbered/There’s more of them than us,” he sings. But never fear — reassurance is just around the corner: “The world has gone out of its mind except for me and you.” J.C. Meshell Ndegeocello, ‘Private Dancer’ “Ventriloquism,” Meshell Ndegeocello’s new LP, is a woozy tour through the R&amp;B of the 1980s and ’90s. It’s also a showcase of the manifold territory that is her style: There’s acoustic balladry, sighing neo-soul, and dance grooves that start in the hips and swirl into the head like an intoxicant. Ms. Ndegeocello practices a coy and unperformative form of seduction — her impenetrability is her sensuality. So it’s no surprise that she takes well to “Private Dancer,” Tina Turner’s coldly steaming ballad about sex work and isolation. Moving through the melody like a lone figure through a fog, Ms. Ndegeocello lends a reticent dignity to the song’s lament. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Lil Dicky featuring Chris Brown, ‘Freaky Friday’ Clever enough to be funny and provocative but not smart enough to anticipate the thinkpieces it’ll engender (if people bother to pay attention), the new single from Lil Dicky and Chris Brown delivers a progressive premise in reductive garb. In the song and video, the two performers trade bodies. Mr. Brown sings the first half as Lil Dicky, puerile as they come, and Lil Dicky raps the second half as Mr. Brown, alluding to his criminal history and alleged gang ties. But it’s the first half, with Mr. Brown enthusiastically singing wish fulfillment for Lil Dicky, that’s most vexing, especially when he thrills at his ability to safely use the one word a white person should not: “Wonder if I can say the N-word/Wait, can I really say the N-word?” And then he does. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And then, once more. J.C. John Zorn featuring Sofía Rei, ‘Ge’ulah’ The improvising saxophonist and avant-garde maestro John Zorn is about to release “The Book Beriah,” the third and final installment of “Masada,” his 613-piece epic based on the Torah’s commandments. This book stretches across 92 tunes and 11 CDs, each disc featuring a different ensemble. Mr. Zorn’s way of presenting “Masada” — a project he first introduced 25 years ago — submits the material fully to the yens of its many performers. He is deliberately skipping a step, nudging back against the idea that a major work establishes its identity through some standard-setting recording. (These “Beriah” pieces have been in circulation onstage since 2014.) On Disc 3, the Spike Orchestra fuses klezmer with surf rock in an oddly resonant admixture, run through the apparatus of a jazz big band. On Disc 7, the Gnostic Trio (harp, guitar, vibraphone) elevates and aerates Mr. Zorn’s cyclical compositions. And in the beginning, on Disc 1, the Argentine vocalist Sofía Rei sings in a declaratory gale over the eight-string SazBass of J.C. Maillard. G.R. Kitty, ‘Recccord’ An alluring dance song by Kitty (formerly Kitty Pryde) that channels the Latin freestyle of the late 1980s. (This is maybe a trendlet in the making — see also SOBxRBE’s recent “Carpoolin’.”) The aura is synthetic and the emotion is confidently cool. J.C. Prince Royce, ‘El Clavo’ As bachateros go, Prince Royce is versatile, a singer who embraces a real range of music, from classic ballads to chintzy pop to street-friendly trap and reggaeton. “El Clavo” is, spiritually, a blend of several of these directions — a slow thumper with a light melody and an urgent sentiment (your man is terrible to you; I am better than your man). J.C. Lil Mosey, ‘Boof Pack’ Dreamlike and lightly whimsical tough talk from the rising rapper Lil Mosey that sets itself apart from SoundCloud rap peers thanks to a cheerful sense of melody and high-test, shimmering, pop-minded production by Royce David. J.C. Kurt Elling, ‘American Tune’ Kurt Elling has covered Paul Simon’s “American Tune” before, as a piano-vocal duet on “1619 Broadway: The Brill Building Project,” but on his forthcoming album, “The Questions,” he sinks into the song more completely. With a full band this time, he sings in a warm-ember baritone over wafted horn harmonies, seeking to reconcile Mr. Simon’s devotional patriotism with a contemporary drive toward action. In this new music video, clips of recent protests mingle with black-and-white factory footage. It’s broad-strokes idealism, soft at the center and deliberately unspecific, but what saves it is Mr. Elling’s voice: bright, devout and earnest. G.R. The Gloaming, ‘The Sailor's Bonnet’ St. Patrick’s Day is not popularly associated with introspection, but try it with a song from the new live album by Gloaming, a group steeped in Irish tradition that carries the music into pensive, even mystical realms, particularly when Thomas Bartlett’s piano transmutes the harmonies. “The Sailor’s Bonnet,” a reel that might have just been a foot-stomper, becomes an odyssey of storm, struggle and completion.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"Her husband asked her to stay away from the lot, where homeless men were known to gather. Her neighbors called her crazy. “But I was eager,” she said, “and I insisted on being part of the process.” Photo Over the years, Jenny’s Garden has sent hundreds of pounds of vegetables to a nearby homeless shelter. Credit Elias Williams for The New York Times On Sunday, Ms. Benitez and her daughter Victoria, 57, led us through what became of those vegetable plots. We walked past rows of blueberry bushes, budding pear trees, a greenhouse with seedlings of asparagus and broccoli, and mounds of crocuses just beginning to push their golden petals out of the soil. The site was recently renamed Jenny’s Garden after Ms. Benitez. “I’m seeing the garden that I was dreaming of,” Ms. Benitez said. Ms. Benitez rested on a bench that was donated in the name of her late husband, and flipped through early photos of the garden. Black-and-white shots revealed abandoned cars, waist-high weeds and a group of young men cleaning graffiti off stone walls. As the photos transitioned to color, the garden took shape, with families planting vegetables, playing and eating in the garden. Over the years, Jenny’s Garden has sent hundreds of pounds of vegetables to a nearby homeless shelter and has been tended by neighbors, schoolchildren, residents of a nearby halfway house, and orange-suited lawbreakers working off their community service. “We’re very proud of what she was able to do,” Victoria said of her mother. The garden has given the Benitez family food, a place to play, and space to mourn — Ms. Benitez planted trees there after the death of her husband and two sons. “It made us feel like this park belonged to us,” Victoria said. “We’ve climbed these trees.” “This tree,” she said, gesturing to one whose trunk provided a bit of cover from the garden, “was where I had my first kiss.” Here’s what else is happening: Weather Today is going to feel like one giant sneeze.

It’s an attempt to get all New Yorkers to read the same book at the same time. Here’s how it works. New Yorkers have the month of April to vote for one of five nominated books: “ If Beale Street Could Talk ” by James Baldwin; “ Manhattan Beach ” by Jennifer Egan; “ White Tears ” by Hari Kunzru; “ Behold the Dreamers ” by Imbolo Mbue; and “ When I Was Puerto Rican ” by Esmeralda Santiago. The winner will be announced in May, to be followed by events and book discussions at libraries around the city. To better inform your vote, around 5,000 copies of the nominated books have already landed at libraries throughout the city, or you can purchase a copy at one of these bookstores. And you can attend a discussion with the four living authors — Imbolo Mbue, Hari Kunzru, Esmeralda Santiago and Jennifer Egan — and the director Barry Jenkins at the New School in Greenwich Village on April 19 at 7:30 p.m. The One Book, One New York program is now in its second year. (Last year’s winner was “Americanah” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.) But that wasn’t the first attempt to get our city on the same page. A 2002 campaign to get New Yorkers to read the same book was canceled when — wait for it — the New Yorkers in charge couldn’t agree on the book.

Bleacher Report Milestones,"Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images The Chicago Bears lost 15-14 to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, falling to 3-9 for the season. While the team's rough season persisted, rookie running back Tarik Cohen returned a punt for a 61-yard touchdown. By adding said play to his highlight reel, Cohen has now scored a touchdown on a running play, pass play, kick return (kick or punt) and has even thrown a touchdown pass. The 22-year-old is the first rookie to score in this variety of ways since Hall of Famer (and former Bear) Gale Sayers did so in 1965, per ESPN.com (h/t Elias Sports Bureau). Cohen, a fourth-round pick out of North Carolina A&amp;T, sits behind second-year running back Jordan Howard on Chicago's depth chart, limiting his opportunities. As a result, he has compiled just 267 yards on the ground during his inaugural season. In fact, he has been more of a threat in the passing game thus far. Over 12 games, Cohen ranks second on the Bears in receiving yards (307) and first in receptions (39). While Cohen has the makings of a dynamic offensive weapon, the Bears have yet to employ him in a productive manner. Chicago's offense as a whole has struggled this season as well. Through Week 13, the Bears have averaged 275.8 yards per game, leading just the Cincinnati Bengals (274.3) in the category. Their 15.9 points per game also rank 30th in the league, ahead of only the New York Giants (15.8) and the Cleveland Browns (14.7). The Bears will attempt to scrape together their fourth win of the season Sunday when they go on the road to face the Bengals in the battle of two anemic offenses.","The Chicago Bears lost 15-14 to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, falling to 3-9 for the season.

David Pescovitz,"MIT researchers developed a robot that can play Jenga based on a novel approach to machine learning that synthesizes sight and touch. From MIT News: 
Alberto Rodriguez, the Walter Henry Gale Career Development Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT, says the robot demonstrates something thats been tricky to attain in previous systems: the ability to quickly learn the best way to carry out a task, not just from visual cues, as it is commonly studied today, but also from tactile, physical interactions.
Unlike in more purely cognitive tasks or games such as chess or Go, playing the game of Jenga also requires mastery of physical skills such as probing, pushing, pulling, placing, and aligning pieces. It requires interactive perception and manipulation, where you have to go and touch the tower to learn how and when to move blocks, Rodriguez says. This is very difficult to simulate, so the robot has to learn in the real world, by interacting with the real Jenga tower. The key challenge is to learn from a relatively small number of experiments by exploiting common sense about objects and physics.
He says the tactile learning system the researchers have developed can be used in applications beyond Jenga, especially in tasks that need careful physical interaction, including separating recyclable objects from landfill trash and assembling consumer products.
In a cellphone assembly line, in almost every single step, the feeling of a snap-fit, or a threaded screw, is coming from force and touch rather than vision, Rodriguez says. Learning models for those actions is prime real-estate for this kind of technology.","MIT researchers developed a robot that can play Jenga based on a novel approach to machine learning that synthesizes sight and touch.

Bonnie Burton,"Daryl Dixon (played Norman Reedus) can out-race the undead on his motorcycle, but will he always be in control during the new season of The Walking Dead? AMC It's no secret The Walking Dead's Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) will be leaving the show. But at New York Comic Con 2018, the show's leadership confirmed three characters who've since left the show will return in the new season. A previously revealed return for Jon Bernthal as as Shane Walsh was already essentially confirmed, but newly revealed were reprisals for Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) and Sasha Williams (Sonequa Martin-Green). The announcement came just as ComicBook.com reported Wilson passed away Friday at the age of 76. ""There were some rumors going around we were trying to lie, but we want to confirm that Jon Bernthal is coming back,"" showrunner Angela Kang said during the NYCC panel. But since Bernthal's character died, was turned into a walker and then was killed again, chances are he'll probably return in a flashback memory moment. Other returning characters Hershel and Sasha could also be part of a dream sequence or flashback. Kang didn't reveal any further details during the panel. Since Lincoln is indeed leaving the show, the cast and crew on the NYCC panel praised him for his work as Grimes, sharing their favorite moments working with him on the set. Producer Dave Alpert said his favorite Rick moments happened during season 1 when Rick rides into Atlanta on horseback and sees the devastation, but he also loves the beginning of season 3 when Grimes rose to the top as a leader of a very complex group of survivors. ""Working with Andrew Lincoln is gonna go down as one of the greatest pleasures of my life,"" actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan (who plays villain Negan on the show) said on the panel. During the panel, fans were asked to pick their favorite Rick scene in a poll. The winning scene ends up being played for the audience -- it's when Rick and Daryl reunite in season 4 where Rick says the famous line, ""It's not on you. It's not on you. You back with us is everything. You're my brother."" Lincoln remarked about the show's fans, ""This is a fervent and intelligent fan base. This interaction with fans is one of the most unique and special things."" Then, Lincoln began doing something for the very first time: Watching an entire episode of The Walking Dead with the fans that love the show, which screened a day early just for them. The previously released season 9 trailers have already confirmed some of the major plot points, which include a two-year time jump since the end of the war with the Saviors at the end of season 8. Fans will see how the characters have grown closer as a group, and have been surviving by living off the land. This new season will also introduce the Whisperers -- antagonists from The Walking Dead comics. The Whisperers, in the comics, skin the dead walkers and wear them so they can live among the undead undetected. The communicate solely through whispering. The Whisperers will include new cast members Samantha Morton as Alpha, Ryan Hurst as Beta, Nadia Hilker as Magna and Cassady McClincy as Lydia. The Walking Dead panel at NYCC was moderated by Talking Dead host Chris Hardwick and included actors Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes), Melissa McBride (Carol Peletier), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Negan), Norman Reedus (Daryl), Danai Gurira (Michonne), new showrunner Angela Kang and executive producers Scott Gimple, Gale Ann Hurd, Dave Alpert, Robert Kirkman and Greg Nicotero.

"USA TODAY, Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY","There's been a policy change at athletic wear firm Under Armour: Employees can no longer use their corporate credit cards to pay for strip club visits. According to the WSJ, execs at Under Armour, led by CEO Kevin Plank, have for years entertained both athletes and co-workers at strip clubs. The WSJ also alleges years of sexual misconduct at the firm. The company says those days are now in the past. It put out a statement, saying it had addressed ""Inappropriate behavior that challenges our values or violates our policies is unacceptableand will not be tolerated. We are committed to providing a respectful and inclusive workplace. Earlier this year, several executives at rival Nike resigned due to complaints that its top leadership ignored or helped exacerbate a culture that is hostile and demeaning to women, what company chairman and CEO Mark Parker said were behavioral issues that are inconsistent with Nike's values. Under Armour, which is based in Baltimore, is best known for selling exercise gear and owns the popular apps MyFitnessPal, Endomondo and MapMyFitness. Armour reported $5 billion in revenue for 2017.

Liz Shannon Miller,"[Editor’s note: The following contains spoilers for “ Better Call Saul ” Season 4 Episode 3, “Something Beautiful.”] It shouldn’t be a surprise that the man responsible for many of “ Breaking Bad ’s” most memorable musical moments would find the secret to returning to the franchise in another song. In the recent “Better Call Saul” episode “Something Beautiful,” when we see Gus encounter Gale Boetticher in the halls of Gale’s lab, the chemist is cheerily singing along to Tom Lehrer’s “The Elements.” It’s a linguistically challenging song, and not the easiest tune to remember… or, as David Costabile told IndieWire, “It was fucking miserable. It’s a fucking miserable song, are you kidding me? It’s impossible. It took forever.” But when it came to revisiting the character who made a major impact during Season 3 of “Breaking Bad,” Costabile said that “one of the things in the episode that makes it much easier is the song. Because what is required in actually singing that tune is really challenging.” Read More: ‘Better Call Saul’ Review: ‘Something Beautiful’ Reveals the Worst Parts of Our Nature It was different when he was asked to memorize the Italian song “Crapa Pelada” for the “Breaking Bad” Season 3 finale, he said: “It was a very difficult Neapolitan dialect, tuned, with a patter and speed, and really, really super tricky. But they gave me weeks and weeks.” However, for “The Elements Song,” Costabile got “a week or 10 days. It was horrific. So I paced around, and I paced around, and then I walked the streets of New York singing the song. And people must have been like, ‘That crazy … The guy really has lost his nut now, what the hell’s wrong with him?’ I sang it everywhere. Everywhere. On the subway, on the bus, everywhere. Everywhere. But I learned it. I knew that song. I still know it, never going to go away.” But Costabile did say that the experience gave him “a great long time to also meditate on this character, too. The song was, in a way, the transformative act of getting back to who that person was.” It’s no surprise that Costabile was thrilled to get the call to return to Albuquerque, especially as it didn’t conflict with his work on “Billions.” “I loved playing that character,” he said. “I thought it was righteously unfair when Vince [Gilligan] decided to kill me. So I was glad that I got to come back as old Gale.” When it comes to his connection to Gale, Costabile described it as a “great marriage.” This especially applied to the character’s innate innocence: “When I auditioned for the role, I felt really deeply connected to that aspect of who he was. His innocence, his hopefulness, his deep-held beliefs about love, the universe, chemistry — it never felt like a stretch in order to find those things. And all of it was in the introductory scene where you first meet him, where they cook together for the first time. He gives him coffee, and they cook, and he recites the Whitman poem to him. It said it all, it was all there. It was all clear to me who that person was.” Continued Costabile, “sometimes that happens to an actor — you really feel deeply connected to who or what the role is, and you don’t get it. Somebody else gets it. And then sometimes you do, and you’re lucky enough to get it. And in this situation I felt really lucky, because I felt so strongly that the way I felt about it was who that person was. “For me, I feel like my job is to transform, and to transform my person into something different. There’s some characters that are difficult to transform into, and then there are others that you just get for free, that are just part of you. You just feel like you’ve got six different guys, and that guy was one of them. They wrote it and then he was inside of me, and I got to do it, and it was a match made in heaven, for me, certainly. Even as short and brief as it was. It’s cool when it happens, sad when it doesn’t. Super sad when it doesn’t.” “Better Call Saul.” Nicole Wilder/AMC/Sony Pictures The most enthralling moment of Gale’s scene with Gus is one simple line, which he delivered earnestly: “It’s the least I can do.” It speaks to a mammoth backstory between the chemist and the… “entrepreneur,” and yes, Costabile knows what’s behind the line. “I know why that is true, yes,” is all he would unfortunately say about what that line says about Gus and Gale’s relationship. But when asked if he thought we’d ever learn more about what that means, he noted that “one of the things that is part of the storytelling about how they’re telling the story is the excitement for ‘Breaking Bad’ fans to be able to also get Easter eggs like that. So, I will definitely say that it’s possible.” However, he made no promises: “It certainly seems probable, given the way that the four seasons so far have evolved, but eh, you never know. I mean, they killed him pretty damn quickly already, so who knows? Maybe they’re just like, ‘Yeah, you’re one and you’re done.'” We’ll see how true that might be.

Abrar Al-Heeti,"Tetra Images/Getty Images
Rachel Kinnon and Jeanie Austin, librarians at the San Francisco Public Library, receive about 60 questions a week from a dedicated group of fans: prison inmates.
The inquiries, usually handwritten and sent by post, range from requests for information about transitioning to life outside of prison to explanations of technologies that may not have existed before a prisoner was put away, like 5G and bitcoin. Song lyrics are a frequent ask. 
Tech infiltrates nearly every aspect of our lives, but remains virtually nonexistent in jails and prisons. Inmates typically don't have access to computers or cell phones. Sometimes they can send and receive electronic messaging, a stripped-down form of email. But it's expensive and limited by character counts. 
That's why Kinnon and Austin are so important to inmates. They serve as human go-betweens for prisoners and information that's often readily available online. 
Prisoners express ""how they were really disconnected before they had this link to the world,"" said Kinnon, who manages the SFPL's Jail and Reentry Services program. ""There's such a desperate need for information.""
The Next Chapter is a multipart series that examines the changing role of libraries in a connected world. 
James Martin/CNET
Unlike Google, which generally returns results in less than a second, the process of answering prisoner questions can take weeks. Kinnon and Austin scan the letters they read and email them to other librarians, who research the answers. Researchers often do a quick Google search for the answer or access dedicated databases such as ProQuest, EBSCO and Gale. 
When the responses come back, the pair review them, print them out and mail them back. 
Librarians: the original search engines
The SFPL, which is celebrating National Library Week along with other US institutions, isn't the only library that serves as a de facto Google for inmates. In fact, its letter-writing service, called Reference by Mail, is modeled after a similar program at the New York Public Library.
The two libraries essentially split the country, with the NYPL taking letters from prisoners in the eastern half of the country and the SFPL taking letters from the western half. A third library, the Harris County Public Library in Houston, takes letters from prisoners in Texas. 
Some of the letters the San Francisco Public Library receives from inmates. 
Rachel Kinnon
There are limits to what they can provide. For example, librarians can't offer legal advice, adult entertainment or information related to violence. Inmates are allowed to write up to two letters a month to the SFPL. 
All responses include a source note explaining why a particular resource was chosen, as well as a reference list. Responses can run as many as 20 pages. Sometimes librarians will write their own explanations. Other times, they'll send an article addressing the topic an inmate is interested in. 
""Sometimes we get asked astrophysics questions, and I'm just like, 'Screenshots all the way,'"" says the SFPL's Austin with a laugh. 
Not all the questions revolve around serious topics. One person wrote to the NYPL asking about the history of the hot dog, while another requested pictures of every My Little Pony. Someone once asked for love spells, particularly ones that would work through mail. 
The fact that prisoners use their limited supply of stamps and envelopes to write to the library is telling of how important the resource is to them, Kinnon says. 
""We've had people say explicitly, 'I wouldn't get any mail if it weren't for you,'"" she says.","At the San Francisco Public Library, librarians serve as gates to online information for those who can't access it themselves.",2019-04-09T12:00:01Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}","Without Google, people behind bars pen their questions to librarians - CNET",https://www.cnet.com/news/without-google-people-behind-bars-pen-their-questions-to-librarians/,https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/BKBntw3bJP-Bt2QQo-41mbgGjG8=/756x567/2019/03/18/977e81e2-fd85-4f30-80b1-2a43520b5883/gettyimages-109440419.jpg,,Cnet.com,gale,1

Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Witches, murderers, ghosts, plagues and other scary things descend in the new season of Amazon's horror series Lore. Based on the award-winning Lore podcast of the same name, the streaming horror anthology series retells some of the most frightening real-life tales in history using documentary footage and dramatic reenactments. Amazon Prime Video released an exclusive behind-the-scenes video of the highly anticipated second season of Lore during the show's panel at New York Comic Con on Friday. The NYCC panel featured executive producers Gale Anne Hurd and Howard T. Owens, podcast creator and show narrator Aaron Mahnke, showrunner Sean Crouch and series actors Josh Bowman, Thomas Kretschmann, Alicia Witt and Elie Haddad. ""We follow the lives of these true-life characters,"" Hurd said during the panel. ""You invest in this world that they try to survive. You can imagine yourself in these worlds and imagine 'what would you do'? but also making sure we are not taking away from the supernatural aspect."" The upcoming six-episode second season will feature new tales including true-life stories around the Witch of Hadley Mary Webster ; rocket scientist Jack Parsons ' obsession with black magic; the dangerous quest to fix the Orloj astronomical clock during the Black Plague in Prague; and an unsolved murder of an entire family in Germany, to name a few. The first season included stories of consumption cases inspiring Bram Stoker's vampire novel Dracula; the horrifying legacy of Dr. Walter Freeman, father of the ice pick lobotomy; the changeling murders; the dark side of the Spiritualist Movement; the origin of the Bedburg werewolf of Germany; and the curse of Robert the Doll. The best part of the series is knowing that after watching each episode, you can discover more about these real-life stories by going down a Wikipedia rabbit hole. Because of Lore, I now know too much about the effects of lobotomies, why people were accidentally buried alive from ""dying"" of consumption, and how a fanatical belief in fairytales can turn you into a murderer. I also have a lot more nightmares. Gee thanks, Amazon. There are also Lore books written by series creator Aaron Mahnke for even more history lessons on everything from real-life cannibals to serial killer H. H. Holmes and his notorious murder hotel.

KENNETH CHANG,"This kind of sensor, known as an accelerometer, can measure changes in the pull of gravity. On Earth, geologists use variations in gravity to probe for underground features such as earthquake faults and ore deposits. Wouldnt it be wild if we had something like that on Mars? said Dr. Lewis, the lead author of the Science paper.
Then he realized that there were indeed accelerometers on Mars. The Curiosity rover was using such devices to track the tilt of the vehicle as it moved across the surface.
Those measurements provided a record of the force of gravity on Curiosity. Luckily, the engineers had already been taking a perfect data set, basically since day one, he said.
Because the sensors were not meant for Dr. Lewiss purpose, the data were quite noisy, he said. The data would jump around pretty severely from day to day.
After calibrating the measurements and averaging out the variations, the researchers found that gravity indeed waned slightly as Curiosity climbed about 1,000 feet in elevation. But it was less than what would have been measured if Curiosity had been hoisted 1,000 feet into the air. That is because of the additional gravitational attraction from the mass of the mountain.
The change in the force was small. For a person who weighs 150 pounds on Earth (and just 57 pounds on Mars because of the weaker gravity), climbing 1,000 feet up Mount Sharp would shed about one-tenth of an ounce.","A self-portrait taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in June 2018 in the Gale Crater, at the center of which stands Mount Sharp, a 3.4-mile-high mound.",2019-01-31T19:09:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How NASA’s Curiosity Rover Weighed a Mountain on Mars,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/science/mars-curiosity-rover-mount-sharp.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/science/01MARS1/01MARS1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,gale,1

The larger brand refresh focuses on revealing the potential of craft. Craft Contemporary supports this strategic vision by assigning new weight and influence to craft. It turns the word craft into a verb, specifically the action of shaping and defining the future. It reads as an open invitation to all audiencesartists, viewers, community members, donorsto collectively engage in the process of making. Craft Contemporary has an alliterative elegance to it; the name feels especially significant and sophisticated in tone, which stylistically lifts and strengthens craft. Omitting Museum was intentional. The name belongs to a versatile space that is constantly changing and evolving. It is so much more than just a museum.From the beginning, this museum was not to shy away from championing new artists or even avant-garde, provocative work. With this in mind, we created a monogram that communicates three things:
1.Bold geometric shapes coming together, to represent community2.Outward facing triangles, speaking to the dissemination of arts and culture3.A forward-facing triangle within the negative space, to visualize the pushing of boundaries.

Opinion
The old name was fine and I actually find it more descriptive of what I might encounter in the museum but I can see the benefit in changing to something that sounds newer rather than older. The problem with the new name is that it doesnt make for a good logo given the extreme length of contemporary vs. craft so there is no easy configuration for a good logo and the chosen everything-in-one-line approach yields a really long logo. Typeset in a relatively nondescript sans serif it looks more like a sentence than an actual logo. To balance out the length of the name and logo-less-ness of the wordmark is a more graphic C monogram that, if you have ever used the Bragadoccio font which is not something you should be doing or have appreciated Paul Rands Colorforms identity, will look familiar. As nice and geometric as that C is I think its a shape that has been overplayed and doesnt feel like a revelation in its choice here. To be fair, though, there are some good uses of it in this identity as seen in those flat paper-y things where the C aligns neatly with color fields or when its been filled with a texture as in the invitation. The other problem I feel exists is that there is no real relationship or synergy between the wordmark and the monogram they are each doing their own thing. Based on the old logo, I cant imagine the museums previous identity being too exhilarating so this change does seem beneficial but its a somewhat odd combination of things.

Jon Schnepp shared the incredibly pixelated image of what Miller’s League would have looked like on Collider’s regular superhero video series, Collider Heroes recently. The team was as follows: Armie Hammer as Batman, DJ Cotrona as Superman, Adam Brody as the Flash, Santiago Cabrera as Aquaman, Megan Gale as Wonder Woman, Hugh Keays-Byrne as Martian Manhunter, and Common as Green Lantern.

Check it out below, and skip to 48:05 in the video to see a bit more: It’s kind of wild just how faithful a lot of the looks are to the comics, although in the modern age of trimmed down, militaristic takes on movie superhero suits, it’s probably a bit jarring to imagine seeing them on the big screen. But alas, for now, this is the closest thing we’ll likely ever see of Miller’s final vision for a Justice League movie. That is, unless a much cleaner image of the team comes along one day.","We’ve heard a lot over the years about Justice League Mortal, George Miller’s scrapped attempt to bring DC’s finest heroes to the big screen, but we’ve barely seen anything from it.

Charles Pulliam-Moore,"When Æ on Flux first premiered on MTV’s Liquid Television back in 1991, there wasn’t really anything else like it on American television. Now, 27 years and one failed cinematic adaptation later, the series is being rebooted once again. Æ on Flux tells the story of a leather-clad assassin from the anarchist nation of Monica who’s locked in an ongoing conflict with the rival country Bregna, a police state. Set in a dystopian future where the two cities are the last remaining strongholds of humanity, Aeon goes out on regular missions to fight for her side’s cause, a fight that frequently brings her face to face with Trevor Goodchild, her enemy and occasional lover. Today, The Hollywood Reporter says MTV is giving it another go by developing a live-action series from Teen Wolf showrunner Jeff Davis and The Walking Dead producer Gale Anne Hurd, who also produced the 2005 film version of the series starring Charlize Theron in the title role. Details about MTV’s newest Æ on Flux project are few and far between, but given how beloved the series was and how reviled Theron’s take on the character still is, one can only imagine that MTV’s going to try and make sure that the new series cleaves a bit closer to the source material.

Mike Wall,"NASA's Mars rover Curiosity recently took a quick break from its mountain-climbing work to reflect on its epic Red Planet journey. About three months ago, the car-size robot captured a series of photos from Vera Rubin Ridge, more than 1,000 feet (300 meters) above the floor of Mars' 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater. Mission team members have stitched these images into a panorama that shows some of the key regions Curiosity has explored since touching down on the Red Planet in August 2012. [ Photos: Spectacular Mars Vistas by NASA's Curiosity ] A view of ""Vera Rubin Ridge"" provided NASA's Curiosity Mars rover: This is a detailed look back over the area where the rover began its mission inside Gale Crater, and of more-distant features of the crater. The right-eye, telephoto-lens camera of the rover's Mastcam took the component images on Oct. 25, 2017. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS ""Even though Curiosity has been steadily climbing for five years, this is the first time we could look back and see the whole mission laid out below us,"" Curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement Tuesday (Jan. 30). ""From our perch on Vera Rubin Ridge, the vast plains of the crater floor stretch out to the spectacular mountain range that forms the northern rim of Gale Crater,"" Vasavada added. Climbing ""Vera Rubin Ridge,"" NASA's Mars rover Curiosity captured this view of the interior and rim of Gale Crater. The scene includes much of the rover's route since its 2012 landing as well as features located up to about 50 miles away. The left-eye camera of the rover's Mastcam took the component images Oct. 25, 2017. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Curiosity's landing site is hidden behind a small hill, but ""Yellowknife Bay"" — the spot where the rover first found evidence that Gale hosted a potentially habitable lake-and-stream system long ago — is visible, mission team members said. So are other important locales, such as ""Kimberley"" and ""Murray Buttes."" Much of Curiosity's work at such sites involved analyzing samples from the interiors of rocks, which the rover snagged using the rock-boring drill at the end of its robotic arm. That drill has been out of commission since December 2016, sidelined by a problem with the motor that pushes the drill bit forward relative to two ""stabilizer points"" on either side of it. This image of the northwestern part of Mars' Gale Crater and terrain north of it, from the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter, gives another perspective of some features visible in an October 2017 panorama from NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. Credit: ESA/DLR/FU Berlin/NASA/JPL-Caltech Curiosity team members have been troubleshooting this issue for more than a year now, and they've come up with a possible solution: using the robotic arm to push the extended bit against a rock, without the use of the stabilizer points. Tests of this new method using a Curiosity twin at JPL have been promising, and the mission team aims to try the technique out for real before the rover leaves Vera Rubin Ridge, NASA officials said.

Matt Patches,"Æon Flux, a secret agent from the year 7698 who starred her own short-form animated series from 1991 to 1995, will again grace the small screen, courtesy of MTV. Expect a costume change. Announced by the network, the rebooted Æon Flux will translate animator Peter Chung’s muscular, pencil-thin animation style into a modern, live-action action vehicle from Teen Wolf creator Jeff Davis and The Walking Dead producer Gale Anne Hurd. The show is not expected to run on MTV proper. Instead, producers hope to shop the series out to streaming platforms like Netflix or Hulu. Little is known about the approach, but one assumes with the success of the CW’s weird-and-proud lineup of DC Comics and Davis’ pulpy take on the Teen Wolf property, that the show will resemble the futuristic, anime-inspired spy stories that made Æon Flux a mesmerizing staple of MTV’s Liquid Television line-up. Or, whatever that looks like without rampant bloodshed and hyper-sexuality. Æon Flux 2.0 has to appeal to the masses (though a previous attempt to do that, 2005’s Charlize Theron-led Æon Flux, was one of the ‘00s great disasters). According to a press release via Deadline, Æon Flux is one of a number of reboots in the works at MTV, via the company’s new production unit, MTV Studios. The major reveal is Daria &amp; Jodie, a new take on the animated series Daria from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Inside Amy Schumer writer Grace Edwards. This time, Daria’s friend Jodie, one of the few African American characters on the original series, shares the spotlight, as the two “take on the world, with their signature satirical voice while deconstructing popular culture, social classes, gender and race.” Additional MTV Studios series include a reboot of The Real World, which will once again find seven strangers living in a house as they stop being polite and start getting real; The Valley, a reality series in the vein of The Hills set in Nogales, Arizona, a town along the border of the United States and Mexico; and an update of the self-improvement series Made, positioned to tackle the topic in a modern world: “In a world of 2D Instagram transformations, MADE pairs talented young underdogs with experts for face to face coaching for total life, real life reinventions.” MTV president Chris McCarthy also tells Deadline that the network may try to reboot Beavis and Butt-Head again, after a short-lived attempt in 2011. There are also plans for resurrecting the Unplugged series, as well as launching a standalone music-driven streaming platform, which would officially take MTV full circle.","MTV wants Netflix, Hulu, and more to bite at its old properties",2018-06-21T14:52:09Z,"{'id': 'polygon', 'name': 'Polygon'}","Aeon Flux live-action reboot, new Daria series announced by MTV",https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/6/21/17467540/aeon-flux-daria-real-world-reboot-mtv,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pC9YDzEtV_M5p1lpSdI24gh9swM=/0x53:811x478/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11544253/38b58e81f671e831a9f7ada979db9262.jpg,polygon,Polygon,gale,1
Aileen Kwun,"Facebook unveiled its newly expanded headquarters in Menlo Park, California, this week—and the giant master-planned development called MPK21, designed by starchitect Frank Gehry, has all the bells and whistles of today’s tech campuses, for lack of a better word, and then some. Completed in just 18 months, the 525,000 square foot, LEED Platinum certified expansion boasts a 3.6-acre rooftop garden with more than 200 trees, and a half-mile long pathway that meanders through to evoke the feel of a walk through the park. A sheltered green space, called the “Town Square,” joins MPK21 to the existing MPK20, which Gehry also designed and completed in 2015, along with a courtyard with amphitheater seating called “The Bowl,” surrounded by 40-foot-tall redwood trees. The employee experience suggested by images and descriptions of the sprawling private property, complete with five unique dining options and a sunken garden, is that this is a place where people should like to live or retreat, rather than work. There’s no shortage of benign buzzwords or self-congratulatory messaging in the video spot. “We’re a culture of builders,” says Janelle Gale, VP of Human Resources. “Part of that is even building our internal space.” [Photo: Christophe Wu/courtesy Facebook] Like Facebook, other big tech companies—including Square, which has described its San Francisco HQ as having “avenues” and a “town square” —have commonly evoked this nostalgia-tinged analogy of urban planning to the point of cliche. Yet this rhetorical marketing device highlights the detached microcosm it has planted within the city. A real avenue is trafficked by people from all walks of life within the context of a city, not just from one office building to another; it exists in a context beyond its contained self, where its inhabitants aren’t vetted, recruited, paid handsomely–or causing a housing crisis for the whole region. Through its imagery and rhetoric, Facebook’s expansion stands as an attempted revival of the traditional company town: a social engineering approach that extends offline, yet remains neatly confined and packaged as a perk for its staff—at least for now. Mk21 is just a hint of Facebook’s wider ambitions to be seen as a positive presence for the South Bay city. Among the detailed embarrassment of riches, the tech giant also shared plans to develop a public, two-acre park and event space, replete with bike paths, a plaza, and a pedestrian walkway for the wealthy South Bay community. Following Facebook’s earlier announcement this year to develop Willow Village —which includes plans to include amenities such as a pharmacy, grocery stores, and more—it seems Facebook’s development spree is just getting started. Yet for many tech companies and particularly for Facebook, winning back an earnest public image both online and IRL will take more effort than the promise of nurturing public-facing development. “As Facebook grows its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, we strive to create a unique workplace and be a good neighbor,” writes John Tenanes, VP of Global Facilities and Real Estate, in a Newsroom post. Do good fences make good neighbors, or would Menlo Park welcome a Facebook-led public development? We’ll have to wait to hear from local residents before the social media giant’s next growth spurt. For now, MPK21 does make Facebook a great neighbor to one Menlo Park resident: itself.","The social media company released images of its newly extended campus, dubbed MPK21, and its aspirations to “be a good neighbor.” Facebook unveiled its newly expanded headquarters in Menlo Park, California, this week—and the giant master-planned development c…",2018-09-07T11:27:50Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fastcompany.com'}",Facebook unveils a glossy new Frank Gehry-designed office,https://www.fastcompany.com/90232824/facebook-unveils-a-glossy-new-frank-gehry-designed-office?partner=feedburner&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+fastcompany%2Fheadlines+%28Fast+Company%29,"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/09/5-90232824-first-look-facebookand8217s-new-frank-gehry-designed-campus-expansion.jpg",,Fastcompany.com,gale,1

The new logo aims to add some visual interest and cool factor through a less corporate vibe. The new wordmark is still on the corporate side but the “Y” adds a touch of distinction and differentiation. It’s okay but I think something else in the wordmark needed to have a twist, perhaps the “A” in “DESTINATIONS”. The dot… I don’t know why it’s there in general nor why it’s there in that particular position — in application it sometimes serves as a pivot to split the logo into a corner, which is both possibly good and bad. In application there is also the addition of a large “D” graphic that can be used as a stroke or filled in with a photo. It’s a nice element and probably the one that stands out the most. There are also arrows, lots of different ones used one at a time but they don’t clearly stand out as a key element, it feels like they couldn’t find the same arrow file to use in different applications. There is also a high-contrast sans serif that, as nice as it is, it is one design aesthetic too many.

USA TODAY Sports Gale Gray (right) sits with his wife Sandy Gray (left), discussing their thoughts on the latest Larry Nassar developments and how they’ve impacted the Holt community. (Photo: Gannon Burgett/Lansing State Journal) HOLT, Mich. — Pastor Noel Heikkinen describes his weekend services at Riverview Church as a place for anyone affected by a tragedy. That may be needed more than ever. The church is in a town where Larry Nassar lived less than 5 miles than Michigan State University, built his reputation as a world-renowned sports medicine doctor and even ran for school board in 2016 while facing sexual-assault allegations. “This is one of those tender times in our community where we have to be very loving,"" Heikkinen said. ""And we get an opportunity because of this to call sin sin and call wickedness wickedness.” ► What we know: Larry Nassar and the USA Gymnastics abuse scandal ► Lessons learned: 7 takeaways from the Larry Nassar sentencing ► Timeline: Dr. Larry Nassar, a history of preying on people Nassar, 54, who had lived in Holt until his December 2016 arrest on child pornography charges a little more than a month after his school-board defeat, was sentenced Wednesday to 40 to 175 years in prison for multiple sexual assault charges, most related to assaults on his patients. Nassar and his wife, Stephanie, lived in a 1,500-square-foot, three-bedroom, three-bathroom house since they bought it new in 1998, according to Delhi Charter Township property records. She filed for divorce in January 2017 and was granted it in July, the minimum waiting period for a divorce in Michigan that involves children; she received sole custody of the couple's three children. “Most people don’t understand the grooming process that predators go through, and Larry (Nassar) was a master groomer. He groomed the entire community.” Rhonda Fenby-Morse, Holt, Mich. The magnitude of Nassar's predatory acts and the damage he's caused this community of more than 20,000 has residents searching for answers. Many want a time to heal, opportunities to educate each other about sexual assault and eventually, when appropriate, a sense of normality. ""I think our image is such now where we’re feeling a little downcast,"" Delhi Township Supervisor John Hayhoe said, ""And we're almost afraid to be from Holt."" Both Heikkinen and Hayhoe live in Holt, have followed the Nassar case regularly and said they want to make sure nothing they say or do does more harm than good at such a sensitive time. This past weekend, Heikkinen had more than 2,700 people at his services in Holt. He also has services each Sunday night inside the Student Union on Michigan State University's campus. Heikkinen said he became aware last week of at least four female members of his congregation whom Nassar sexually abused. Hayhoe, as an elected official, struggles to find the proper response and actions. He's open to having the township play host to a public forum or attempt to offer more resources, but wonders if it's best to just stay focused on day-to-day things like streets, sidewalks and parks. ► Jan. 26: Senators want investigation of U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics ► Jan. 26: Michigan State athletic director resigns in wake of Nassar scandal “I don’t want to step in and do something that would make the situation worse,"" Hayhoe said. Before Nassar faced criminal charges, he was the administrator of a Facebook group called Holt Community Matters. The entrance sign to Holt, Mich., sits off on the side of Holt Road. This community of more than 20,000 residents lies south of Lansing, Mich., and fewer than 5 miles from Michigan State University. (Photo: Gannon Burgett, Lansing (Mich.) State Journal) He was known for discussing Holt Public Schools topics, including the district's decision to move ninth-grade students, who would be about 15 years old, to its main campus. Nassar put on a facade that he cared for the community and was a protector of children, said Rhonda Fenby-Morse, a former member of the group. Those actions, coupled with his pedigree as a medical healer generous with his time, have Fenby-Morse, 53, feeling betrayed. She has two daughters ages 17 and 28. She remains stunned that some Holt residents still believe Nassar didn't commit any crimes. For the town to truly get past this nightmare, it must foster a culture of accountability, honesty and respect, Fenby-Morse said. “This is far more prevalent than (Nassar apologists) would like to believe,"" Fenby-Morse said of sexual assault. ""There’s a lot of victim shaming. Most people don’t understand the grooming process that predators go through, and Larry was a master groomer. ""He groomed the entire community,” she said. In fall 2016, Nassar was running for one of two spots on the Holt Public Schools' Board of Education. At the time, Nassar faced public allegations of sexual abuse from Rachael Denhollander of Louisville, Ky., a former gymnast from Kalamazoo, Mich. ► Jan. 26: Michigan State students pay tribute to Nassar survivors ► Jan. 25: Indianapolis Star investigation hailed as proof of local journalism impact Michigan State University officials first relieved him of clinical and patient duties and then fired him Sept. 20, 2016. In the Nov. 8 election, he placed third with 3,426 votes. On Nov. 21, he was charged with sexual assault involving a minor younger than 13. Within three months, he would face nearly two dozen charges. “Everybody's kind of shocked because he was trusted.” Steven Marvin, Holt, Mich. Now, 14 months after that election, Holt Superintendent David Hornak is encouraging anyone whom Nassar may have assaulted on school property to come forward. The district's investigation was made public Wednesday in Hornak's letter to parents, staffers and others. District officials became aware of three Nassar victims assaulted in the high school's athletics building when they heard the women talk about it at Nassar's sentencing hearing, Hornak said in email Thursday to the Lansing State Journal. For Gale and Sandy Gray, the Nassar case is a lesson in the importance of listening and asking more questions. The couple from nearby Dimondale, Mich., have been visiting Biggby Coffee here for a handful of years. They said recently it hasn’t been unusual for conversations within the coffee shop or at a restaurant to center on Nassar. “The whole thing is making people more aware, and probably more girls and women are speaking their piece,” Gale Gray said. ► Jan. 25: USOC gives USA Gymnastics board six days to resign or be decertified ► Jan. 25: Rachael Denhollander's courage led army of Larry Nassar accusers Steven Marvin, owner of a salon in Holt, called the amount of time that Nassar's actions had remained hidden “ridiculous” and said he was horrified to hear that some of the abuse happened at Holt schools. “I think everyone’s kind of shocked because he was trusted,” Marvin said.

Al Jazeera,"A NASA robot has found more building blocks for life on Mars, the most complex organic matter yet from 3.5 billion-year-old rocks on the surface of the red planet, the US space agency said on Thursday. The unmanned Curiosity rover has also found increasing evidence for seasonal variations of methane on Mars, indicating the source of the gas is likely the planet itself, or possibly its subsurface water. The data, collected through drilling into the lowest point of the red planet's Gale crater, is part of the US space agency's newly widened search for organic molecules that could indicate past life on the surface of Mars. This is a significant breakthrough because it means there are organic materials preserved in some of the harshest environments on Mars Jennifer Eigenbrode, an astrobiologist at NASA Additional data from the robotic probe confirms the detection of ""seasonal patterns"" in methane levels, NASA geophysicist Ashwin Vasvada said in the live-streamed announcement. NASA scientist Chris Webster confirmed that water has been found on the martian surface and has been present for ""a very long time,"" which points strongly toward a ""habitable environment"". The detection of a ""repeatable identifiable methane cycle"" could be a sign of active biological processes, Webster said. While not direct evidence of life, the compounds drilled from Mars' gale crater are the most diverse array ever taken from the surface of the planet since the robotic vehicle landed in 2012, experts say. ""This is a significant breakthrough because it means there are organic materials preserved in some of the harshest environments on Mars,"" Jennifer Eigenbrode, an astrobiologist at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center, told AFP news agency. ""And maybe we can find something better preserved than that, that has signatures of life in it,"" she said. NASA's first announcement of the presence of organic compounds on Mars came in 2014 when small levels of chlorinated methane compounds were detected. ""This is the first really trusted detection,"" Sanjeev Gupta, a professor of Earth science at Imperial College London, said. ""What this new study is showing in some detail is the discovery of complex and diverse organic compounds in the sediments. That doesn't mean life, but organic compounds are the building blocks of life."" ""This is the first time we have detected such a diverse array of these sorts of things,"" he added. NASA is planning to launch a new rover as early as July 2020 with a mission to comprehensively determine whether life ever arose on Mars, while characterising the climate and geology of the red planet and preparing for human exploration. The European and Russian rover, ExoMars, is scheduled to land in 2021. It will drill even deeper than any prior instrument, up to two yards (meters) deep, and set them aside for a possible future pickup and return to Earth.",The data was collected through drilling into the lowest point of the red planet's gale crater.,2018-06-08T07:53:48Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",NASA robot finds 'building blocks for life' on Mars,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/nasa-robot-finds-building-blocks-life-mars-180608061527733.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/6/8/4c38ace874ef413daad04ba1be11d5a3_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,gale,1
Lara Walsh,"When Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth wed in an intimate Tennessee ceremony fashioned after the nuptials of the singer's parents on December 23, it was a union between two young Hollywood stars. 
 You might be now wondering: What is Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth's net worth together? Between Cyrus's music and TV appearances as well as her Aussie beau's acting career, the pair are both bringing a considerable fortune to the table. 
Cyrus and Hemsworth started building their wealth from a young age
Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth starred as Ronnie and Will in ""The Last Song.""
 Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 
According to Celebrity Net Worth, Cyrus is worth upwards of $160 million while Hemsworth clocks in around $26 million, which makes them collectively worth a reported $186 million. 
 Cyrus got her start in 2006 playing Hannah Montana on the beloved Disney channel series. In addition to reportedly bagging about $15,000 per episode, per NY Post, and her subsequent $54 million ""Hannah Montana"" world tour, the 26-year-old's ""Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert"" documentary banked over $70 million. 
 Meanwhile, Hemsworth got his start playing Josh Taylor in 2007-2008 on the Australian series ""Neighbors"" before first laying eyes on his future wife in 2010's ""The Last Song,"" which grossed $89,041,656. 
Cyrus has her successful music career and YouTube to thank for much of her financial prowess
Miley Cyrus's song ""Wrecking Ball"" topped charts.
Miley Cyrus VEVO/YouTube
While Cyrus's child star roots helped her get her footing, the ""We Can't Stop"" hitmaker made her real money from all the bangers she released in the following years. Case in point: Cyrus bagged nine top ten songs on the Billboard 100 list. In addition to slaying the tour game (she's reported by Forbes to have grossed $67.1 million for her Wonder World tour and $100 million for her Bangerz tour), the 26-year-old also had her twerking and VMA's shenanigans to thank for her considerable YouTube revenue. 
 After her infamous 2013 performance with Robin Thicke, it only took 24 hours for ""Wrecking Ball"" to garner 19 million views on Vevo while party anthem ""We Can't Stop"" hit the 100 million mark in just 37 days. 
The ""Hunger Games"" Franchise put Hemsworth's career on the map
Liam Hemsworth played Gale alongside Jennifer lawrence in ""Hunger Games.""
 Lionsgate 
While the Aussie star first made our way into our hearts as Will Blakelee on ""The Last Song,"" he got his big break in the ""Hunger Games"" franchise. While it's unknown how much he was paid for the entire franchise, the first film opened to the third-best box office debut of all time and grossed $691 million. Co-star Jennifer Lawrence was paid $10 million for the sequel ""Catching Fire,"" and it's rumored that Hemsworth raked in $2 million for his role. 
Speaking of acting, Cyrus has also made several returns to the big and small screen
Miley Cyrus was a judge on ""The Voice.""

The singer has also added some acting credits to her name, including voicing characters in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" and ""Bolt,"" although it's unlikely that these smaller roles have added significantly to her net worth. 
Her return to TV as a judge on ""The Voice"" for seasons 11 and 13 was definitely profitable, as she reportedly made $13 million for her debut in 2016. While Cyrus didn't head back onto the show for season 14 and she's kept a relatively low profile of late, Hemsworth is next set to appear in the 2019 rom-com ""Isn't It Romantic"" with Priyanka Chopra, Rebel Wilson, and Adam Devine in February.

Cory Doctorow,"A long time ago, obesity was often used as a shorthand for wealth, but over the decades obesity has become more and more correlated with poverty, both in culture and science (while wealth is increasingly correlated with being slim). The trend is accelerating. Researchers from Cambridge University's Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR) say the obesity gap between the rich and poor is wider than ever. It's hard to pinpoint a single cause for this, but the usual suspects are: the cheapest calories are the worst ones (carbs, sugars, etc); exercise is expensive both in terms of cash (austerity has squeezed community centres and parks) and time; the cognitive capacity that could be used to plan better meals is absorbed by juggling bills, precarious work, and increasingly expensive housing; high-quality food is more expensive than ever and often not sold in the increasingly segregated neighbourhoods where poor people live. But the underlying causes of childhood obesity are fiendishly tricky to fix.

Cory Doctorow,"Parents of Seattle, Spokane, Portland, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Provo, Houston, Fort Worth, Austin, Plano, Detroit, Troy, Warren, Kansas City and Pittsburgh: beware. According to a peer reviewed study of kindergartners whose parents had opted out of vaccination, these cities are the places with the lowest herd immunity to preventable, debilitating (and potentially fatal) diseases. Vaccinations are not 100% effective, and some people can't be vaccinated due to illness. The reason vaccination keeps our children of dying or being maimed for life by the diseases that burned through generation after generation is ""herd immunity"": if all the kids get immunized, then the disease can't find enough people to infect and spread. In a report published Tuesday in PLOS Medicine, researchers from several Texas academic centers tracked the increasing number of children with exemptions in all 18 states from the 2009-2010 to 2016-2017 school years. They characterized many rural counties, as well as urban areas, as “hotspots” because their high exemption rates put them at risk for epidemics of measles, whooping cough and other pediatric infectious diseases. Idaho has eight of the top 10 counties with the highest exemption rates, the study found. In Camas County in southern Idaho, nearly 27 percent of the kindergarten population opted out of childhood vaccinations in the 2016-2017 school year, according to the study.

Fred Topel,"Judgment Day was supposed to happen in 1997 according to Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The cautionary tale began in 1984s The Terminator, which wasnt the first science fiction tale to warn about artificial intelligence. Terminator co-writer and producer Gale Anne Hurd said that science fiction and other genres have been ahead of the curve on these matters, and she hopes real science catches up soon. Lets hear it for science fiction, fantasy and horror, Hurd said at a Screamfest Q&amp;A before she was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award. Stephen Hawking only came up with the idea that we need to worry about A.I. and robots about two and a half years before he passed away. I remember saying to Jim, If hed only watched The Terminator. Perhaps scientists dismiss movies as popcorn fiction (were looking at you, Neil DeGrasse Tyson), but Hurd feels storytellers are doing the important work that should be a requirement of real science. We are cutting edge, she continued. We create and think about things that the people who are being paid so much money, the scientists and the physicists, the mathematicians, biotech people arent even considering. The more leaps and bounds are made in technology right now, the more fearful we should be that these scenarios may come to pass. While real science is not quite where Skynet was in The Terminator, its not hard to imagine us getting there. Hurd has a proactive solution to avoid reaching a robot holocaust situation. She thinks tech industries should teach the same code of ethics that medical school teaches. The one thing that they dont teach in engineering schools and biotech is ethics and thinking about not only consequences, but unintended consequences, Hurd said. If you go to medical school, theres the Hippocratic Oath, first do no harm. I think we really need that in all of these new technologies. Hurds suggestion is almost breathtakingly simple to address potentially global issues. In the medical profession, breaking the Hippocratic Oath could be grounds for medical malpractice and losing ones license. Were the tech industry to adopt a similar practice, it might give developers more foresight into the possible abuses of their inventions, or at least encourage them to develop safeguards if for nothing else than to cover their own backs. Meanwhile, James Cameron is producing a sixth Terminator film, though without Hurd, so the cautionary tale will continue.

Mike Wall,"A new self-portrait by NASA's Mars rover Curiosity shows the dusty robot hard at work on the slopes of a towering Red Planet mountain. Curiosity took the selfie on Jan. 23 from Vera Rubin Ridge, a site about 1,000 vertical feet (300 meters) up the flanks of Mount Sharp. This massif rises about 3.4 miles (5.5 kilometers) into the Martian sky from the center of Gale Crater; its peak is obscured by Curiosity's head-like mast in the new photo. Curiosity landed on the floor of the 96-mile-wide (154 km) Gale in August 2012 and has been working its way up through Mount Sharp's foothills since September 2014. [ 10 Awesome Space Robot Selfies ] ""The mountain's base provides access to layers formed over millions of years,"" NASA officials wrote in a description of the selfie, which was released Wednesday (Jan. 31). ""These layers formed in the presence of water — likely due to a lake or lakes where sediments accumulated, which formed these layers inside Gale Crater."" Curiosity has been exploring Vera Rubin Ridge for several months now. Over the next few weeks, the mission team plans to drive the rover up the slope directly behind it in the photo, to check out some clay-rich deposits, NASA officials said. The selfie is a mosaic composed of dozens of photos captured by Curiosity's Mars Hands Lens Imager, which sits at the end of the rover's 7-foot-long (2.1 m) robotic arm. This flexible arm wasn't in any of the shots that make up the selfie, which explains why the photo looks like something a Martian friend of Curiosity's could have taken.

As Councilmember, she successfully passed legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave for most hourly employees, compelling landlords to fix repeat violations, requiring all City data be published online, and the nation’s first law protecting domestic workers. She was the founding chair of the Council’s Technology Committee in 2002. Immediately prior to her election to the City Council, Brewer served as Project Manager for the NYC Nonprofits Project at CUNY’s Graduate Center, and before that worked for the Telesis Corporation, a private firm that builds affordable housing in New York City. Prior to that non-profit and private-sector experience, Brewer served in City government in various roles, including as… New York City Deputy Public Advocate for Intergovernmental Affairs under Mark Green (1994-1998). Director of Mayor Dinkins’ Federal Office in New York City, managing the administration’s legislative agenda in Washington and a technical assistance program to help community-based organizations obtain federal funds (1990 to 1994). Executive Director of the Mayor’s Commission on the Status of Women (concurrent with the Federal Office, from 1993 to 1994). Chief of Staff to West Side Councilmember Ruth W. Messinger– before Messinger was, herself, elected Manhattan Borough President (1979-1989). Brewer also served on the staff of Lt. Governor Mary Anne Krupsak, the first women elected statewide in New York in 1974 (under Gov. Hugh Carey) and first served in government in the City Parks Department during the Lindsay administration. Brewer has an MPA from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, and she did her undergraduate work at Columbia University and Bennington College. She co-teaches a class in urban policy each spring with former Borough President Messinger as part of Hunter College’s Public Service Scholar program, and has taught urban affairs at other area colleges, including Barnard, Baruch, Brooklyn and Queens Colleges. Brewer is married to Cal Snyder; they live on the Upper West Side. Together they have raised many foster children.","President of the Borough of Manhattan Gale A.

PTI,"WASHINGTON: The record-breaking 15-year-long Mars mission of NASA's Opportunity rover was declared over after the US space agency failed to contact the robotic explorer for over eight months.
The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in June last year.
After more than a thousand commands to restore contact, engineers in the Space Flight Operations Facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made their last attempt to revive Opportunity Tuesday, to no avail.
The solar-powered rover's final communication was received June 10.
Designed to last just 90 Martian days and travel 1,000 metres, Opportunity vastly surpassed all expectations in its endurance, scientific value and longevity.
In addition to exceeding its life expectancy by 60 times, the rover travelled more than 45 kilometres by the time it reached its most appropriate final resting spot on Mars -- Perseverance Valley.
""For more than a decade, Opportunity has been an icon in the field of planetary exploration, teaching us about Mars' ancient past as a wet, potentially habitable planet, and revealing uncharted Martian landscapes,"" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
""Whatever loss we feel now must be tempered with the knowledge that the legacy of Opportunity continues -- both on the surface of Mars with the Curiosity rover and InSight lander -- and in the clean rooms of JPL, where the upcoming Mars 2020 rover is taking shape,"" said Zurbuchen.
The final transmission, sent via the 70-metre Mars Station antenna at NASA's Goldstone Deep Space Complex in California, ended a multifaceted, eight-month recovery strategy in an attempt to compel the rover to communicate.
""We have made every reasonable engineering effort to try to recover Opportunity and have determined that the likelihood of receiving a signal is far too low to continue recovery efforts,"" said John Callas, manager of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project at JPL.
Opportunity landed in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars on January 24, 2004, seven months after its launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.
Its twin rover, Spirit, landed 20 days earlier in the 166-kilometre-wide Gusev Crater on the other side of Mars.
Spirit logged almost eight kilometres before its mission wrapped up in May 2011.
From the day Opportunity landed, the mission team on Earth collaborated to overcome challenges and get the rover from one geologic site on Mars to the next.
They plotted workable avenues over rugged terrain so that the 174-kilogramme Martian explorer could manoeuvre around and, at times, over rocks and boulders, climb gravel-strewn slopes as steep as 32-degrees, probe crater floors, summit hills and traverse possible dry riverbeds.
Its final venture brought it to the western limb of Perseverance Valley.
""I cannot think of a more appropriate place for Opportunity to endure on the surface of Mars than one called Perseverance Valley,"" said Michael Watkins, director of JPL.
Mars exploration continues unabated.
NASA's InSight lander, which touched down on November 26, is just beginning its scientific investigations.
The Curiosity rover has been exploring Gale Crater for more than six years.
NASA's Mars 2020 rover and the European Space Agency's ExoMars rover both will launch in July 2020, becoming the first rover missions designed to seek signs of past microbial life on the Red Planet.","NASA's Opportunity rover mission on Mars 'bites the dust' after eight months of no communication The New Indian Express Designed to last just 90 Martian days and travel 1000 metres, Opportunity vastly surpassed all expectations in its endurance, scientific va…",2019-02-14T13:02:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Newindianexpress.com'}",NASA's Opportunity rover mission on Mars 'bites the dust' after eight months of no communication - The New Indian Express,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2019/feb/14/nasas-opportunity-rover-mission-on-mars-bites-the-dust-after-eight-months-of-no-coomunication-1938836.html,http://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2019/2/14/w600X390/opportunity-rover_625x300_1528799854278.jpg,,Newindianexpress.com,gale,1
"Tariq Malik, SPACE.com","On Mars, the sky is dust. A massive dust storm on Mars that covered one-fourth of the planet just a week ago has grown into a global weather event, NASA officials said Wednesday (June 20). The dust storm has knocked NASA’s Opportunity rover offline for want of sunlight. The agency’s nuclear-powered Curiosity, meanwhile, is snapping photos of the ever-darkening Martian sky. The two rovers are on opposite sides of Mars. “The Martian dust storm has grown in size and is now officially a ‘planet-encircling’ (or ‘global’) dust event,” NASA officials said in a statement. The last dust storm on Mars to go global occurred in 2007, five years before the Curiosity rover landed at its Gale Crater site, according to officials with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. The Opportunity rover has been exploring the plains of Meridiani Planum on the opposite side of Mars since 2004. During that 2007 Martian dust storm, NASA also lost contact with Opportunity for days due to low power levels from the lack of sunlight. NASA lost contact with Opportunity last week when it missed a check-in call on June 12. NASA engineers think the rover is in a low-power mode, waking up only periodically to check if its batteries have recharged enough to phone home. All science operations by the rover are suspended while it waits out the storm. “A recent analysis of the rover’s long-term survivability in Mars’ extreme cold suggests Opportunity’s electronics and batteries can stay warm enough to function,” NASA officials wrote in a separate update Wednesday. ""Regardless, the project doesn’s expect to hear back from Opportunity until the skies begin to clear over the rover. That doesn’s stop them from listening for the rover every day.” The Martian dust storm was first detected on May 30 by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Once it was clear that the storm would impact Opportunity, the rover was ordered into a sort of survival mode. A series of photos by Opportunity before it went silent show the Martian sky darkening until the sun itself disappears from view. Scientists measure the amount of sunlight-blocking haze in the Martian atmosphere as “tau,” with the current tau at Curiosity’s Gale Crater site reaching above 8.0, JPL officials said in the NASA statement. The last tau for Opportunity’s site was over 11. The atmosphere is so thick with dust, “accurate measurements are no longer possible for Mars’ oldest active rover.” According to NASA, the 2018 dust storm is not as big as the 2007 dust storm that Opportunity survived 11 years ago. It’s more similar to a dust storm seen by the Viking 1 lander in 1977. Past dust storms seen by NASA’s Mariner 9 spacecraft from 1971 to 1972, as well as by the Mars Global Surveyor in 2001, were also much larger. During those storms, only the tallest volcanoes on Mars were visible poking above the dust. “The current dust storm is more diffuse and patchy; it’s anyone’s guess how it will further develop, but it shows no sign of clearing,” NASA officials wrote in the second update. NASA scientists are maintaining a full-court press on the Martian dust storm. In addition to Curiosity’s weather observations on the surface, NASA has several other spacecraft tracking the storm from orbit: the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey and MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission) studying the Martian atmosphere. The European Space Agency also has two spacecraft in orbit ( Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter ). India’s Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft is also in orbit. A key question for scientists is why some dust storms on Mars become planet-enshrouding events and last months while others fade away in a week. “We don’t have any good idea,” Scott Guzewich, an atmospheric scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in the statement. Guzewich is leading the Curiosity rover’s dust storm work. New photos from Curiosity show a wall of haze over Gale Crater that is up to eight times thicker than normal for this time on Mars, NASA officials said. One photo also shows a curious lack of shadows. That’s because the entire sky on Mars is red and illuminating the rocks from all sides, NASA officials explained. While the dust storm won’t affect Curiosity’s power levels, the low-light conditions are forcing the rover to take longer exposures when it snaps photographs, NASA officials said. When Curiosity is not taking pictures, the rover rotates its mast-mounted Mastcam camera to face the ground, to protect it from blowing dust, they added.

Katyanna Quach,"Brainiacs have today revealed how they rejigged instruments aboard NASAs Martian rover Curiosity to measure changes in the Red Planet's gravity over its surface.
""Curiosity, essentially, has a new science instrument, six and a half years into its mission,"" said Kevin Lewis, lead author of a published paper describing the work, and an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University. ""This allows us to get new information about the subsurface of Mars in ways the rover was never designed to do.""
A team of researchers from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, John Hopkins University, Carnegie Institution, University of Maryland, and Arizona State University, all in the USA, were responsible for calibrating the Curiositys accelerometers for gravimetry. The nuclear-powered rover has highly sensitive accelerometers, and the aforementioned boffins were able to repurpose these to measure gravity on Mars.
As the rover climbed Mount Sharp, a five-kilometre-high formation (that's roughly three miles high) in the center of the Gale Crater, the team measured the difference in gravity it experienced along the way.
This allowed the researchers to measure the density of the rock underneath Curiosity's wheels. To their surprise, the rock was less dense than expected, according to the rejigged sensors.
Data taken earlier from Curiosity's CheMin instrument, which analyzes the mineralogy of the rock samples, pegged the density of the sedimentary rock at a higher density than was measured by the gravity readings. This suggested the sedimentary rock was highly porous.
This provides hints as to how Mount Sharp formed in the Gale Crater. Some scientists believed that it was once filled with sedimentary rock that slowly eroded away over time. However, being so porous, it now looks like it grew by accumulation of material over time.
""This study represents the first gravity traverse and measurement of rock density on Mars. The low density of rocks in Gale Crater suggests that they did not undergo deep burial,"" said Nicholas Schmerr, coauthor of the paper and an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, on Thursday.
""This could mean that Mount Sharp was not excavated by erosion, but rather was constructed by wind deposition and other processes. Either way, it seems that Mars has had the capability to lay down significant amounts of low-density sedimentary rocks that record a complex environmental history."" ®","Shock after accelerometers hacked, in the old-school sense, and rock density probed Brainiacs have today revealed how they rejigged instruments aboard NASA’s Martian rover Curiosity to measure changes in the Red Planet's gravity over its surface.… <!--#includ…",2019-02-01T06:03:11Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theregister.co.uk'}","Are you aware of the gravity of the situation on Mars?

Patricia Kitchen,"Long Islanders can expect heavy rain and potential flash flooding Thursday as a cold front from the west interacts with tropical moisture from the south, forecasters said. Associated with Tropical Storm Michael, the moisture, surging northward from eastern North Carolina and Virginia, will move up into the area this afternoon and tonight, the National Weather Service said in a flash flood watch. The watch is in effect for the entire metropolitan region. On Long Island, the watch lasts from noon through late Thursday. The storm itself will stay to the south, moving off the coast and into the mid-Atlantic later in the day, according to the National Hurricane Center track. Look for showers and a few thunderstorms starting late morning to early afternoon, said Joe Pollina, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Upton. Long Island is looking at 1.5 to 2 inches of rain Thursday, with 2 to 4 possible in some spots, the watch said. Any heavy precipitation falling within a one- to three-hour time frame could result in flash flooding. With the Island already having had an abundance of recent precipitation, the ground is still rather moist and with up to 2 inches of rain or even a bit more possible, there will be some local flooding to contend with, said News 12 Long Island meteorologist Bill Korbel. Isolated minor coastal flooding is expected with the morning to early afternoon high tide cycle, particularly for the most vulnerable spots along the South Shore bays of Nassau County.

The weather service issued a small craft advisory from noon to 6 a.m. Friday for seas of 7 to 11 feet and a gale warning until 6 p.m. Friday, both for waters off the South Shore. There is also a small craft advisory for the Long Island Sound. Thursday should be the last day with highs in the mid-70s for the near future as the cold front moves in. Thursday's low will be near 61. ""We have big changes coming our way,"" said News 12 Long Island meteorologist Rich Hoffman. ""Go find those jackets, because youre going to need them by the weekend."" Showers continue into Friday morning, with cloudy skies gradually becoming mostly sunny. The day also sees an increase in winds from the northwest, with a few gusts of 35 to 40 mph possible. Highs will be in the mid-60s with lows dropping all the way to the low 40s. Saturday and Sunday will have highs near 60 and lows near 50. ""Overall most of the weekend looks good for outdoor fall events just watching wet weather Saturday morning,"" Hoffman said. This will be the first time this month that daily highs dip to below normal, which at this point is 64 degrees at Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma. As of day-end Wednesday, the month so far was averaging 10.2 degrees above normal.","Newsday Long Island weather: Heavy rain, flash flood watch Thursday Newsday Long Islanders can expect heavy rain and potential flash flooding Thursday as a cold front from the west interacts with tropical moisture from the south, forecasters said.

Fred Topel,"Its rare for major studio blockbusters to have downer endings. The Terminator films sort of require it. They are about a nuclear apocalypse in which machines overpower humanity. The best victory afforded humans in those films is that the leader of the human resistance, John Connor, lives to defeat Skynet. Only Terminator 2: Judgment Day ends with the hope of averting the war, and subsequent sequels assured that the war rages on. Back in 1984, there was no franchise to support The Terminator. The first film ends with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) surviving after Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) sacrificed himself fighting the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), but not before helping her conceive John Connor. Producer and co-writer Gale Anne Hurd recalled the development execs who wanted the original film to have a happier ending. We got notes to end the film before the end of the film, Hurd said at a Screamfest Q&amp;A before the presentation of her Lifetime Achievement Award. Not even have The Terminator rise out as the endoskeleton, but just end with Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor hugging. As a first time writer/producer, having just graduated from Roger Cormans studio, Hurd had to be bold to fight for her vision with co-writer and director James Cameron. I mean, your first movie and youre telling people, No, youre wrong. Its not an easy thing to do, she said. Fortunately, Hurd and Cameron were not alone in their vision for The Terminator. Thanks to some behind the scenes support, the ending of The Terminator remained appropriately bleak. There are also more unsung heroes which is that one of our strongest supporters was the head of the completion bond company, Film Finances here in Los Angeles, Hurd said. The late Lindsley Parsons Sr. knew what The Terminator was going to be. Roger [Corman] knew what The Terminator was going to be and not a lot of people did. You absolutely need people to believe in you. You also need people to tell you when youre screwing up that you can listen to. Lindsley was all of that. Roger has always been all of that, but we could have bowed to the pressure. Or, we could have been wrong and not listened to the things that made the film better. Luckily we had each others backs. Had Cameron and Hurd been forced to saddle The Terminator with a happy ending, and it had still become a hit, perhaps Biehn could have starred in sequels. But then we would have never seen the iconic metal endoskeleton with Stan Winstons landmark designs and stop motion animation. Well take the tragic ending. Now there is a sixth Terminator film on the way, some 35 years later. At the time, The Terminator was just another big idea looking for someone to say yes. We can spend all night talking about the 99 rejections, and we kept persevering until the 100th time we pitched it, somebody said yes, Hurd said.

JAN M. OLSEN / AP,"(COPENHAGEN, Denmark) — A ferry with some 300 people on board was stranded in the Baltic Sea on Tuesday after the ship’s engine failed and sent smoke pouring from the engine room, the Danish operator said. The Regina Seaways was in international waters off Kalingrad, Russia’s Baltic Sea exclave between Poland and Lithuania, when the breakdown occurred, Copenhagen-based DFDS Seaways said, adding that the smoke triggered the ship’s fire extinguisher system in the engine room. Passengers assembled at muster stations in preparation for a possible evacuation, but the situation was under control and an evacuation wasn’t immediately necessary, DFDS spokesman Gert Jakobsen told The Associated Press. There were no reports of injuries. “We are talking about a malfunction in the engine room that caused a lot of smoke,” Jakobsen said. “Right now we are inspecting the engine room to find out whether the ship can sail on its own or needs to be tugged.” The ferry, which also had cars and trucks on board, was traveling from Kiel, Germany, to Klaipeda, Lithuania’s port city north of Kaliningrad. The crossing normally takes about 20 hours. “On these kinds of crossings we have people from Germany, the Baltic countries and Russia. We cannot say now who was on board,” Jakobsen said. The ship was about 85 kilometers (50 miles) from Klaipeda, said Vaidas Klumbys, another DFDS spokesman. He said that on Tuesday afternoon “we received the information from the ship that it was undergoing vibrations and smoke rising from the engines.” Russian state news agency Tass quoted Andrei Permyakov, head of the sea rescue coordination center in Kaliningrad, as saying that rescuers from Lithuania, Russia and Poland had responded. Lithuania’s navy said one of its helicopters and three navy vessels were sent to the site in case an evacuation was necessary. The regional news agency, Baltic News Services, quoted Klumbys as saying “the weather conditions are not good.” Forecasts for the southeastern part of the Baltic Sea said there were gale force winds, rain showers, poor visibility and risk of thunder storms in the region. Jakobsen wasn’t aware of any rescue operation, saying there was no evacuation. “But in this kind of situation, everyone steps in,” he said. The Regina Seaways was built in 2010 and can carry up to 500 passengers. ___ David Keyton in Stockholm, Liudas Dapkus in Vilnius, Lithuania, and Jim Heintz in Moscow, contributed to this report. ___ A previous version of this story was corrected to show that Kiel is in Germany, not Lithuania.","A ferry with some 300 people on board was stranded in the Baltic Sea on Tuesday after the ship's engine failed, the Danish operator said.",2018-10-02T17:14:39Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Hundreds of Ferry Passengers Stranded in the Baltic Sea After Engine Malfunction,http://time.com/5412862/ferry-passengers-stranded-baltic-sea/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ferry-stranded-baltic-sea.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,gale,1

Costas Kantouris and Elena Becatoros / AP,"(MATI, Greece) — Rescue crews were searching Wednesday through charred homes and cars for those still missing after the deadliest wildfires to hit Greece in decades decimated seaside areas near Athens, killing at least 74 people and sending thousands fleeing. There was no official indication as to how many people might be missing, and some took to social media and Greek television stations with appeals for information on their loved ones. The death toll was expected to increase as crews searched more of the areas affected by the fires. More than 280 firefighters were still in the area to the northeast of Athens in the wider Rafina area, dousing the remaining flames to prevent flare-ups. A further 200 firefighters backed up by a water-dropping helicopter were tackling the second forest fire west of the capital, near Agioi Theodori, where local authorities pre-emptively evacuated three nearby communities overnight, according to the fire department. Flags across Greece were flying at half-staff after the prime minister declared three days of national mourning for the victims. The two fires on either side of the Greek capital started Monday within hours of each other, and were fanned by gale-force winds that hampered firefighting efforts. Read more : Photos Show Scale of Devastation From Deadly Athens Wildfires The speed with which the fire northeast of Athens spread took many by surprise, and is believed to have contributed to the high death toll. “We couldn’t see any fire. The fire came suddenly. There was so much wind, we didn’t realize how it happened,” said Anna Kiriazova, 56, who survived with her husband by shutting themselves in their house instead of trying to flee through the flames. Kiriazova said they doused their house in the Mati area near Rafina with water from a garden hose, and credited the fact that their window frames were metal instead of wood for their home being spared. “We shut ourselves in the house, we closed the shutters, we had towels over our faces,” she told The Associated Press. “The inferno lasted about an hour. I have no words to describe what we lived through.” Her 65-year-old husband, Theodoros Christopoulos, said the couple decided to take shelter in their home because the narrow roads outside were jammed with cars. “There was a great panic because the whole street was blocked by cars,” Christopoulos said. “Shouting, hysteria, they could see the fire was coming with the wind. It already smelled a lot, the sky was black overhead and in no time at all the fire was here.” Hundreds of others abandoned cars and fled to nearby beaches, from where they were evacuated hours later by coast guard and private boats.

The Associated Press,"Interested in Greece Wildfires? Add Greece Wildfires as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Greece Wildfires news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Frantic relatives headed to Athens' morgue Thursday, searching for loved ones missing in Greece's deadliest forest fire in decades as rescue crews and volunteers continued the hunt on land and at sea for potential victims. The death toll inched up, with the fire department announcing the number of dead at 82. Many of the bodies were burnt beyond recognition, making identification difficult. Those arriving at the morgue were being informed of the necessary steps to match the missing and the dead, including providing DNA samples and dental records. Police said a team specializing in the identification of disaster victims had been activated following a request from the fire department. ""The procedure is difficult, harder than that of other mass disasters which we have dealt with in the past as a forensics department,"" said coroner Nikolaos Kalogrias. ""Here the main cause of death was burning, in most cases the complete burning (of the body) so identification is very difficult."" The fire northeast of Athens in the area of Rafina, a seaside resort of permanent residences and holiday homes popular with Athenians and tourists, broke out Monday and raced through the area, fanned by gale-force winds. The identification procedure was further complicated by the fact that the fire was across a large area and there was no way of knowing how many people had been in the area at the time. By Thursday afternoon, there was still no official number of missing. Thanassis Moraitis arrived at the morgue searching for his 90-year-old mother. He had tried to drive away in a car with his mother, wife and 19-year-old son, but the fire was too fast and they had to abandon the car and run to the beach and into the water. He suffered burns to his leg from the heat of the air. His mother didn't make it. ""In the sea there was a rain of fire, there was smoke, there was a Force 12 wind,"" said the 53-year-old, adding that boats picked the family up after about three hours. ""I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye to my mother,"" Moraitis said. Fire department spokeswoman Stavroula Malliri said the search for further potential victims continued. Rescue crews had not been able to enter homes that had not been destroyed and were shut, she said, adding that the search would not end until every building in the area had been thoroughly investigated. Apart from the house-to-house searches, coast guard and volunteer divers were also searching the waters off the coast of the worst affected areas and a nearby deserted island. During the fire, hundreds fled to nearby beaches, with many swimming out to sea to escape the ferocious flames and choking smoke. Dozens spent hours at sea before being picked up by coast guard vessels, fishing boats and a passing ferry. Several of the dead were people who drowned. The worse affected area was the seaside community of Mati, where the majority of victims were found, including 26 people found huddled together, many embracing. Arriving at the morgue with her son, Maria Saridou was hoping her 55-year old sister, Eleni, was not among the victims. She had gone swimming with a friend of hers in Mati, Saridou said, but the two became separated in the chaos of the fire. She hadn't heard from her since. ""We found her car, it wasn't burnt, nor was the house,"" said 60-year-old Saridou. ""It's just that we can't find her.... I believe she's alive. Where she went, nobody knows where she went."" Hundreds of homes were burnt. The speed with which the flames spread took many by surprise. The narrow streets of Mati, an area built up with no town planning, quickly became clogged with parked and abandoned cars as people tried to flee, hampering access by firefighting trucks and blocking escape routes. One Belgian national and one Irish national were among those confirmed dead. Some of the casualties are believed to have tried to make it to the shore through narrow pathways, but lost their way in the thick smoke or had their paths blocked by the swift-moving blaze. Even those on beaches were not safe, as flames burned trees and vegetation at the water's edge, while flaming pine cones rained downward, survivors have said. Recriminations about the apparent lack of an evacuation plan and what many perceived to have been a slow response has mounted, with survivors saying they had been abandoned to do whatever they could to save themselves alone. Firefighting and rescue efforts, particularly from the air and the sea, were hampered by gale force winds and rough seas. When the Rafina fire broke out, crews were also engaged in fighting a massive fire west of Athens that had broken out hours earlier and also burnt homes. But survivors have accused authorities of failing to adequately prepare and for not evacuating the area, as well as not responding fast enough. Defense Minister Panos Kammenos visited Mati Thursday morning and was heckled by distraught men and women, who accused authorities of not doing enough in the initial hours of the fire. ""People died for nothing!"" one woman sobbed at the minister. Local resident Giannis Kardiakos, who said he stayed in the area until midnight, said efforts to tackle the blaze and to rescue those who had fled to the beaches started too late. ""There was no protection, there was nothing!... I'm saying things as they were,"" he said, as Kammenos detailed what the military and firefighters had been doing to battle the fire. ""I'm not lying. We're not talking politically here,"" he added, before breaking down in tears. ———— Thanassis Stavrakis in Mati, Greece, and Menelaos Hadjicostis in Athens contributed to this report.","People searching for loved ones missing in Greece's deadliest forest fire in decades that killed 81 people are arriving at Athens' morgue to begin the heartbreaking procedure of identifying the dead, as rescue crews continue for potential further victims",2018-07-26T11:49:55Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Frantic relatives search for missing in Athens' morgue,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/frantic-relatives-search-missing-athens-morgue-56831564,https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_bdd08fb6523e49d3a5264d754c5c4fce_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,gale,1
Jennifer Earl,"From evidence of a stream to key ingredients for life, NASA's car-sized Curiosity rover has made some interesting finds since it landed on Mars back in August 2012. Photos fed back from the Red Planet have captivated Earth for years — and now officials are gearing up to announce its newest discovery. NASA’s Planetary Science Division said it would release ""new science results"" on Thursday, leading many eager space fans to question whether the rover has found new evidence of life on Mars. In May, the Curiosity rover collected its first drilled sample from the planet in more than a year. ""The team used tremendous ingenuity to devise a new drilling technique and implement it on another planet,"" Curiosity Deputy Project Manager Steve Lee said in an online statement at the time. ""Those are two vital inches of innovation from 60 million miles away. We're thrilled that the result was so successful."" The rover is able to snap images as well as analyze various rock and soil samples taken from the Red Planet. Here's what the device has discovered thus far. Ancient stream bed NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence of an ancient streambed in September 2012. (NASA) A stream once ran across the Red Planet, the Curosity discovered in September 2012. Scientists had previously found examples that suggested there was once water on the planet, but NASA said this evidence of a stream bed was the ""first of its kind."" Curiosity picked up rocks that were made up of ancient stream bed gravel, proving water used to flow where the rover was driving — between the Gale Crater and a mountain inside the crater called Mount Sharp. ""From the size of gravels it carried, we can interpret the water was moving about 3 feet per second, with a depth somewhere between ankle and hip deep,"" Curiosity science co-investigator William Dietrich of the University of California, Berkeley, said in a blog post on NASA's website. ""Plenty of papers have been written about channels on Mars with many different hypotheses about the flows in them. This is the first time we're actually seeing water-transported gravel on Mars. This is a transition from speculation about the size of streambed material to direct observation of it."" Methane In 2014 the rover measured a tenfold spike in methane, an organic chemical, in the atmosphere around it. (NASA) In 2014, the rover measured a ""tenfold spike in methane,"" a chemical compound, in Mars' atmosphere. ""This temporary increase in methane -- sharply up and then back down -- tells us there must be some relatively localized source,"" Sushil Atreya of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and member of the Curiosity rover science team, said in an online statement about the discovery. ""There are many possible sources, biological or non-biological, such as interaction of water and rock."" Clouds NASA's Curiosity rover captured images of cirrus clouds on July 17, 2017. (NASA) Yes, there are clouds on Mars. Curosity captured the beauty of cirrus clouds, which are made up of ice crystals, on July 17, 2017. ""These Martian clouds are likely composed of crystals of water ice that condense onto dust grains in the cold Martian atmosphere. Cirrus wisps appear as ice crystals fall and evaporate in patterns known as 'fall streaks' or 'mare's tails,"" NASA said in a statement released a month later. It wasn't the first time clouds have been spotted on Mars — but it was the clearest picture of the clouds that scientists had ever seen, NASA said. Boron NASA's Curiosity rover captured traces of the element Boron in September 2017. (NASA) Traces of the chemical element Boron were found on the Red Planet in September 2017. On Earth, the chemical is a ""necessary component for the origin of life,"" a study published in peer-reviewed scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters explained. ""On Mars, its presence suggests that subsurface groundwater conditions could have supported prebiotic chemical reactions if organics were also present and provides additional support for the past habitability of Gale crater.""","From animal-shaped rocks to key ingredients for life, NASA's Curiosity rover has made some interesting finds since it landed on Mars in August 2012.",2018-06-07T16:50:00Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}",Mars Curiosity rover's surprising finds from the Red Planet through the years,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2018/06/07/mars-curiosity-rovers-surprising-finds-from-red-planet-through-years.html,http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/images/2015/12/21/curiosity-rover-mars-methane.jpg.img.png/0/0/1490349370575.png?ve=1,fox-news,Fox News,gale,1
Mike Wall,"We may be one step closer to cracking the Mars methane mystery.
NASA's Curiosity rover mission recently determined that background levels of methane in Mars' atmosphere cycle seasonally
, peaking in the northern summer. The six-wheeled robot has also detected two surges
 to date of the gas inside the Red Planet's 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater — once in June 2013, and then again in late 2013 through early 2014.
These finds have intrigued astrobiologists, because methane is a possible biosignature
. Though the gas can be produced by a variety of geological processes, the vast majority of methane in Earth's air is pumped out by microbes and other living creatures.
Related: The Search for Life on Mars: A Photo Timeline
Some answers may soon be on the horizon, because that June 2013 detection has just been firmed up. Europe's Mars Express orbiter
 noted the spike as well from that spacecraft's perch high above the Red Planet, a new study reports.
""While previous observations, including that of Curiosity, have been debated, this first independent confirmation of a methane spike increases confidence in the detections,"" said study lead author Marco Giuranna, of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Rome.
And that's not all. Giuranna and his team also traced the likely source of the June 2013 plume to a geologically complex region about 310 miles (500 kilometers) east of Gale Crater.
Whiffs of Gale Crater air
The researchers used data gathered by Mars Express' Planetary Fourier Spectrometer instrument (PFS), which also sniffed out traces of Red Planet methane back in 2004. (The spacecraft has been orbiting Mars since December 2003.)
Giuranna, the PFS principal investigator, had prepared for synergy with the Curiosity team. Soon after the rover's August 2012 touchdown inside Gale, he decided to monitor the air above the crater over the long term, Giuranna said.
It's tricky to measure Red Planet methane from Mars orbit, for a variety of reasons, including the gas's low abundance and weak absorption. (It's no picnic measuring Mars methane from Earth, either, because the much more plentiful methane in our planet's atmosphere can complicate observations and interpretations. These factors help explain the debate Giuranna referenced above.)  
So, Giuranna and his colleagues developed a new approach to PFS data selection, processing and analysis. For the new study, they applied this approach to measurements made over Gale Crater during the first 20 months of Curiosity's mission on Mars
. 
They found one hit: a peak of about 15.5 parts per billion (ppb) methane by volume on June 16, 2013. That was just one Martian day after Curiosity detected a peak of nearly 6 ppb. 
""We were very lucky, as this is not the result of coordinated observations,"" Giuranna told Space.com via email. ""Just by chance!""
By the way, background methane levels in Gale Crater's air, as measured by Curiosity, range from about 0.24 ppb to 0.65 ppb.
Related: Photos: Red Planet Views from Europe's Mars Express
Tracing the source
The study team also homed in on the methane plume's possible source region, using two independent approaches. 
The researchers divided the area around Gale Crater into a series of squares, each of which measured nearly 155 miles (250 km) on a side. They then used computer simulations to create 1 million methane-release scenarios for every square, to assess the probability of each one as a source for the Gale gas. The scientists also studied the geology of each square, looking for features that might be associated with methane emission, such as fault lines and fault intersections.
""Remarkably, we saw that the atmospheric simulation and geological assessment, performed independently of each other, suggested the same region of provenance of the methane, which is situated about 500 km east of Gale,"" Giuranna said. ""This is very exciting and largely unexpected.""
That potential source region may contain methane trapped beneath ice, he added.
""That methane could be released episodically along faults that break through the permafrost due to partial melting of ice, gas pressure buildup induced by gas accumulation during migration, or stresses due to planetary adjustments or local meteorite impact,"" the researchers wrote in the new study, which was published online today (April 1) in the journal Nature Geoscience
.
Still lots of work to do
The paper doesn't address the ultimate origin of the methane — whether it was churned out by Martian microbes or reactions involving hot water and certain types of rock. And scientists don't know if the detected methane was produced recently or long ago; it could have been trapped under the ice for eons, after all.
But the new study could help researchers get to the bottom of such questions eventually. For example, Mars Express will eye the potential source region in detail in the future, Giuranna said. And other spacecraft, such as the methane-sniffing Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) — part of the European-Russian ExoMars program
 — may do so as well.
Indeed, Giuranna's team is involved with the TGO mission
, which arrived at Mars in October 2016. And coordinated TGO-Mars Express measurements are in the works. The PFS team also aims to apply its new analysis techniques to the instrument's entire data set, Giuranna said.
""Follow-up is very important to better understand methane on Mars,"" he said. ""We are collecting pieces of a puzzle and need more pieces to understand better what is going on.""

Mary Papenfuss,"President Donald Trump likes to boast that hes breaking records with the latest low unemployment figures. Heres another record for his administration: The 2018 federal deficit hit the highest level of the last six years. The deficit jumped 17 percent (or by $113 billion) to $779 billion at the end of Trumps first fiscal year, according to final figures released Monday by the Treasury Department. Thats mostly due to the massive corporate tax cut that slashed rates from 35 percent to 21 percent for top incomes, choking revenue for spending, which climbed 3 percent. Much of that was a hike in defense spending and money to pay interest on the climbing federal debt, CNN reported. The U.S. governments $523 billion in interest payments to service its debt in 2018 the highest ever was more than the entire economic output of Belgium this year, Bloomberg reported. Corporate tax collections in the U.S. fell 22 percent, or $76 billion, in the fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. The total federal debt which combines annual deficits was 78 percent of the nations entire gross domestic product in June. It hasnt been that large a percentage since World War II. Trump promised the tax cuts would pay for themselves by boosting business, which would produce more taxes. But that hasnt yet happened. The Trump administration estimates that the deficit will increase to $1.09 trillion in the next fiscal year. The federal government usually increases spending and deficits to boost a faltering economy such as during the 2008 recession triggered by the subprime mortgage and banking crisis. But the economy was already in a strong recovery when Trump moved into the White House, and he still boosted the deficit. By cutting taxes in 2017 when the economy was already quite strong, Congress and the administration not only missed a golden opportunity to begin to address the fiscal problem, they actually made the problem worse, William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told CBS News. The GOP had traditionally been the party that battled for a balanced federal budget. 4 Republican policies led to a $779 billion deficit in 2018: - Bush Tax Cuts: $488 B - Trump Tax Cuts: $164 B - Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: $127 B - Defense increases since 9/11: $156 B Without tax cuts for the wealthy and endless wars we would've had a $156 billion SURPLUS. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) October 15, 2018",The federal deficit has soared 17 percent in the president's first fiscal year.,2018-10-16T04:32:53Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Trump hits a new high-water mark: The biggest federal deficit in 6 years.,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-deficit-highest-six-years_us_5bc545ece4b0a8f17ee4c5d6,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bc54c9a1f0000040325960d.jpeg?cache=qbo5ejdbmd&ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,gale,1
UnderConsideration,"Established in 1957, the Recording Academy is a U.S. organization that represents performers, songwriters, producers, engineers, and all music professionals while honoring achievements in the recording arts and supporting the music community. Headquartered in Santa Monica, CA, with 12 chapters across the country, the organization is best known for its annual Grammy Awards, presented since 1959. This month, the Recording Academy introduced a new identity designed by Siegel+Gale. By introducing color and rendering the gramophone in both static and animated form, the new logo illustrates the variety of music genres and music creators the Recording Academy advocates on behalf of. In its pure graphic form, the gramophone remains the core identifier for the GRAMMY Awards and the Recording Academy’s programs. When animated, the logotype adapts the width of its letters to the sound and rhythm of music it is paired with. The various renderings of the gramophone serve as the foundation for a modern visual identity that is as dynamic as the music it is designed to represent. Logo. Your browser does not support the video tag. Animated wordmark with sound. Stay with it as the music and animation change. Any time a logo loses its Trajan wordmark an angel wins back the wings it may have previously lost through any number of other design crimes. In its defense, there was nothing inherently bad about the old logo but Trajan is the least imaginative or differentiating font to be used in a logo. The new logo keeps the gramophone icon intact — after all, it’s a graphic representation of the Grammys’ trophy — but supplements it with a sans serif with contrasting thicknesses, exuding a 1950s glamour aesthetic without being completely a throwback as there is some modernity to the letterforms. I understand that the icon had to stay but perhaps could have been run a little smaller to make it feel less monolithic. The musically-responsive wordmark is cool and a valiant concept but I wonder what its application is, given that the Recording Academy is more of a “parent company” with less contact with the general audience. I mean, I’m not saying it’s useless in any way, more like being sad that it’s not actually going to play a significant role in the identity, because I also don’t picture static applications where the logo is rendered in those funky widths. Still, I enjoy this and perhaps a Joshua-Davis-like music activation could take it up to 11. Your browser does not support the video tag. 3D view of the gramophone. Gramophone variations. The gramophone icon has been rendered in 3D to be used in dramatic close-ups as an abstract graphic element in the applications.

Exhibit catalog. Grammy Museum logo and billboards. The applications are okay; I like the brochure where the green crop of the gramophone meets the blue crop but not so much how it’s integrated with pictures. The supporting typeface feels very default-ish throughout. These could all be fairly cool with a little more refinement and structure. Overall, it strikes a good balance of feeling like an organization with 50-plus years of legacy but not completely out of touch with the present.","“Yes your Parents’ Gramophone” Established in 1957, the Recording Academy is a U.S. organization that represents performers, songwriters, producers, engineers, and all music professionals while honoring achievements in the recording arts and supporting the mu…",2018-01-23T10:27:02Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Underconsideration.com'}",Reviewed: New Logo and Identity for the Recording Academy by Siegel+Gale,https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_the_recording_academy_by_siegelgale.php,https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/recording_academy_logo_before_after.png,,Underconsideration.com,gale,1
James Pomfret,"HONG KONG/MANILA (Reuters) - A super typhoon made landfall in China’s Guangdong on Sunday, the country’s most populous province, after barreling past Hong Kong and Macau and killing at least 29 people in the Philippines. Packing gale force winds of more than 200 kph (125 mph), tropical cyclone Mangkhut is considered the strongest to hit the region this year, equivalent to a maximum Category 5 “intense hurricane” in the Atlantic. Mangkhut, the Thai name for Southeast Asia’s mangosteen fruit, skirted 100 km (62 miles) south of Hong Kong and veered west toward the coast of Guangdong and the gaming center of Macau. Hong Kong raised its highest No. 10 typhoon signal at mid-morning as ferocious winds uprooted trees and smashed windows in office and residential buildings, some of which swayed in the gusts, residents said. “It swayed for quite a long time, at least two hours. It made me feel so dizzy,” said Elaine Wong, who lives in a high-rise tower in Kowloon. Water levels surged 3.5 m (12 ft) in some places, waves swamped roads and washed up live fish, washing into some residential blocks and a mall in an eastern district. “It’s the worst I’ve seen,” resident Martin Wong told Reuters. “I’ve not seen the roads flood like this, (and) the windows shake like this, before.” The plans of tens of thousands of travelers were disrupted by flight cancellations at Hong Kong’s international airport, a major regional hub. Airlines such as flagship carrier Cathay Pacific canceled many flights last week. Philippine authorities said a baby and a toddler were among the 29 dead, most of them in landslides in mountainous areas that left at least 13 missing. “The landslides happened as some residents returned to their homes after the typhoon,” disaster response coordinator Francis Tolentino told DZMM Radio, adding that most of the 5.7 million people affected had made advance preparations. “It was not so severe as we expected it to be because earlier it was noted it would also be strong,” said President Rodrigo Duterte, following an aerial survey of some affected areas. In Macau, which halted casino gambling late on Saturday and put China’s People’s Liberation Army on standby for disaster relief help, some streets were flooded. “The suspension is for the safety of casino employees, visitors to the city, and residents,” said authorities in the world’s largest gambling hub, who faced criticism last year after a typhoon that killed nine and caused severe damage. China has ordered thousands of boats to return to harbor, and evacuated thousands of offshore oil platform workers, the state news agency, Xinhua, said. GRAPHIC: Typhoon Mangkhut - tmsnrt.rs/2oZmnIS “KING OF STORMS” The typhoon, dubbed the “King of Storms” by Chinese media, made landfall in Haiyan town at 5:00 p.m. local time, packing winds of more than 160 kph (100 mph), weather officials said. Ports, oil refineries and industrial plants in the area have been shut. Power to some areas were also reduced as a precaution. The storm has fueled concern about sugar production in Guangdong, which accounts for a tenth of national output, at about 1 million tonnes. China sugar futures rose last week on fears for the cane crop. Guangdong is also China’s most populous province, with a population of more than 100 million. The airport in the boomtown of Shenzhen has been shut since midnight, and will be closed until 8:00 a.m. (2400 GMT) on Monday. Flights have been canceled in Guangzhou and the neighboring island province of Hainan. High winds and swells have also hit Fujian province north of Guangdong, shutting ports, suspending ferry services and cancelling more than 100 flights. Waves as high as 7.3 meters (24 ft) were sighted in the Taiwan Strait, Xinhua said. Mangkhut’s northwesterly track will bring heavy rain and winds to the autonomous region of Guangxi early on Monday, before it weakens into a tropical depression to reach southwestern Yunnan next day.

Mike Wall Space.com Senior Writer,"NASA's Curiosity Mars rover noticed this summer's monster dust storm fairly early on — but not in the way you might expect. The storm was first spotted from above by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on May 30 as a localized event near Perseverance Valley, a landform being explored by the agency's Opportunity rover. The dust storm grew quickly over the following days, as Curiosity's observations showed. Curiosity's home is the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater, on the other side of the planet from Perseverance Valley, but it saw signs of the storm on June 5. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: What It Means for Opportunity Rover ] ""All my charts showed the dust storm effect on the actuator because it's exposed; it's sitting out there on the rover deck,"" Benito Prats, an electromechanical engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in a statement. ""All of a sudden, I saw the daytime temperature drop really quickly."" The nighttime temperature stayed abnormally high as well, as it does during big Martian dust storms: While all that dirt in the air blocks sunlight during the day, it also prevents infrared radiation from escaping to space at night, keeping things warmer than usual after the sun goes down. The storm continued to grow, eventually encircling the planet by June 20. Its intensity plunged Perseverance Valley into perpetual darkness, blocking so much sunlight that the solar-powered Opportunity couldn't recharge its batteries. The golf-cart-size rover, which has been exploring Mars since January 2004, hasn't made a peep since June 10. The motor's temperature measurements helped the Curiosity team keep tabs on the storm (which they also did using the rover's onboard weather station). And Prats combined the dust-storm data with historic readings from the motor, to predict when the storm might start clearing up. ""At sol 2,125 (July 28), I noticed a linear trend,"" Prats said, ""so I said, OK, I can predict that sol 2,180 (Sept. 23) is going to be when we're going to get out of the dust storm and the temperature will return back to normal, though I later updated that to sol 2,175 (Sept. 18)."" (A sol is a Martian day, which is about 40 minutes longer than an Earth day. The sol numbers referenced by Prats are the number of Martian days since Curiosity's touchdown on the Red Planet, which occurred on Aug. 5, 2012.) That forecast proved accurate: Dust levels in Gale Crater had returned to normal by Sept. 18, according to the motor measurements, NASA officials said. Curiosity was largely unaffected by the storm, because it runs on nuclear rather than solar power. (Curiosity is currently sidelined by an issue with its memory, however.) The skies over Perseverance Valley have cleared as well. Indeed, Opportunity's handlers began stepping up their attempts to hail the silent rover on Sept. 11, kicking off a 45-day ""active listening"" campaign. If this effort fails to rouse the rover, the team will assess its next steps, NASA officials have said. Opportunity mission leaders have said that they'll keep listening on a passive basis at least through the end of January, however. Scientists are eager to study all the data they can about the recent Mars dust storm, to get a better handle on these fairly regular, but poorly understood, events. For example, researchers can't accurately predict when a global dust storm will arise on Mars, and they don't know why some small storms balloon into planet-girding monsters, whereas others fade away. ""I can estimate, two years in advance, the temperature, air pressure, and whether there's going to be dust or clouds in the air during the non-dusty season anywhere on the planet,"" Scott Guzewich, an atmospheric scientist at NASA Goddard who leads Curiosity's dust-storm investigation, said in the same statement. ""But during the dusty season, in locations that have dust storms, I can't give you any prediction at all that there will be a dust storm on one day and not another.""

All these bold and neutral logos are telling the consumer the same message: Our brand and our services are simple, straight-forward, and clear. And extremely readable.” –Thierry Brunfaut, creative director and founding partner at Base Design The More Generic, The More Reliable “I see this as a natural step for brands to take as they grow from scrappy startups into established brands. Your goals have shifted from making noise and standing out to being a trusted, dependable part of people’s everyday lives. That heartfelt personality and idiosyncrasy that defined you as you started out, and won over your early adopters, can be a limitation as you aim for broad appeal (and bigger revenue). “There is an equal danger that we think brand equals color/type/logo, but this avoids the world that brands are now thriving in. More established tech brands deliver their personality through their service, their content, their voice, the way they sound and behave. They can afford to make their personality more present and alive than a startup with one app or one site can ever be–viewed like this, the friendly corporate typefaces of the world aren’t much of an issue.” –Andy Harvey, creative director at Moving Brands The Logo Isn’t The Brand Anymore “People at the head of these powerful digital brands, as any strong brand, know very well they are not defined by their logo anymore but by the product or service they provide. They are strong, thanks to what they allow you to do with them. Before, logo designers would look for a ‘concept’ when designing a logo. That is obviously not needed anymore: The brand is the concept. Their logos may look similar, but what they offer is totally different and effective, and that’s what finally counts for the consumer. They are 100% recognizable. “These brands are now so good at what they do and so widely used they have become part of our everyday life and culture. That’s why they do not need logos anymore, as they become words (or even better, verbs) in our daily language. Sayings like “I will just google this” is the best example. Becoming words, these brands will be articulated in sentences and texts more and more. To reinforce that, most of those brands now spend on designing custom typefaces instead of logos: a custom typeface becoming their recognizable voice on every platform or device.” –Thierry Brunfaut, creative director and founding partner at Base Design “I think another trend right now is that the logo is not doing all the work. It’s doing a lot less work in terms of defining the identity. So much of the identity now is defined by a lot of elements and experiences that surround the logo, that are supporting it. My metaphor is, think about the logo as the keystone in the bridge. It’s central but there’s a whole bunch of other things around it that keep that bridge intact and get you from one side of the river to another. It has to fit with a lot of other component parts.” –Howard Belk, co-CEO at Siegel + Gale Simpler Logos Work Better On Smart Phones “Since the great rejection of skeuomorphism in 2007, the tech sector has been endlessly repeating the same ‘flat’ design style chiefly because we don’t need metaphors in UX like we did in the early days of popular tech, and because it just works faster and better on small-screen smartphones. Tech typography has been influenced by this to such an extent that it’s all becoming quite stale and straight-out-of-the-box predictable. But it’s no different to many other categories where visual codes become so entrenched, to see anything else would invite rejection. “I think if you look across many categories (but not all) you can see the same thing happening. Perhaps not with exactly the same fonts, but certainly a category style. For example, if you look at luxury brands they can be very conformist, as can categories like Scottish whiskey or pain relief. They all have their familiar codes, tropes, and clichés. “So we’re probably stuck with it for a while yet, until someone blows it all up again. And to that I say, bring it on.” –Nick Clark, executive creative director at Superunion New York","Branding experts weigh in. Why do so many tech companies’ logos look the same?

"Mark Hay, Harry Cheadle","The Republican tax reform plan is advancing with surprising speed. Sure, it’s wildly unpopular, probably because it benefits mainly the rich and corporations while hurting some middle- and working-class people. But the GOP’s desperate need to score a major legislative win by year’s end, combined with a procedurally greased path and political scandals diverting popular attention, are driving the plan forward. This trajectory makes it seem the GOP could— contrary to experts’ expectations when tax work started in earnest—get something passed, perhaps by year’s end. “This does seem to be moving towards an actual enactment,” said Chris Edwards, a tax policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. “I’d give it 70-30 at this point, maybe.” But though a bill passed out of the House last week, the apparent Republican unity and progress on the tax plan to this point is deceptive. There is wide agreement within the GOP on permanently chopping corporate taxes. When it comes to individual cuts, though, there are vast differences between the House and Senate bills, even on the number of tax brackets there should be. As negotiations between Republicans approach and the public pays more attention to the proposals, there are many provisions that could trigger internal debates or cause a swell of disruptive grassroots outrage. As William Gale, the co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center told me, “the Republicans are trying to push so much, so fast, that it’s just hard to keep track of it all.” To prepare for the fights that will almost inevitably break out as Republicans try to reconcile their scattered positions after the Thanksgiving break, here’s a quick rundown of the five most controversial elements of the current House and Senate bills. These are far from the only arguments taking place in DC over taxes, but they are probably the most important: Cutting State and Local Tax (SALT) Deductions Republicans are paying for their tax cuts in large part by slashing deductions people can take on their taxes. Edwards referred to this as “chair shuffling” that will leave most in roughly the same shape as they are now, albeit with a simpler tax form. But if you rely on these deductions you will likely end up worse off, especially when it comes to SALT. Currently, residents of states and cities with high taxes—these are mostly blue states like New York and California—can reduce their tax burden by writing off a portion of what they pay for local services on their federal filings. The Senate bill eliminates this deduction entirely, while the House bill still lets people deduct up to $10,000 in local property taxes (this obviously doesn’t help those who don’t own property). Gale argued this move is anti-growth “since it would raise marginal tax rates, by up to 4 percentage points, on the highest earners in many of the most productive states and areas in the country.” It’s also regressive, he added, because states may feel pressured to lower their own tax rates to limit those effects, in turn making it harder for them to fund public services, which “is going to hurt low- and middle-income families, not to mention the economy as a whole.” Republicans in states that rely on SALT deductions are faced with the tough choice of having to vote against the bill or vote to effectively raise taxes on some constituents. Granted, there was less dissent in the House than many expected. But two Republican senators, Susan Collins and Rand Paul, have expressed their concerns about killing SALT deductions, and more House members may defect as the plan moves forward. Killing the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Individual Mandate The mandate that everyone must buy insurance or else face a tax penalty has always been the most unpopular element of the ACA. The Senate bill eliminates it, which Republicans are selling to the public as working-class tax relief because most people who get hit with the penalty make under $50,000 a year. It also frees up $300 billion to use on other cuts. However those savings come because millions will likely drop or lose their coverage if the mandate is axed, reducing the amount the government pays in subsidies. It will also likely lead to thousands of preventable deaths per year and an increase in premiums as those will opt to drop their coverage will probably be the young and healthy, leaving the remaining pool sicker, older, and costlier. Though this piece wasn’t included in the House bill, surprisingly the provision triggered almost no outcry in the Senate, despite that chamber’s yearlong reputation as the graveyard for anti-ACA legislation. But Collins, who has voted against previous ACA repeal measures, has come out hard against ditching the mandate. Most analysts expect this to become a larger flashpoint as liberal activists play up the coverage loss and premium increases and as Republicans debate the issue among themselves. Cutting Taxes on “Pass-Through” Businesses This bit has received far less attention than others in large part because it’s esoteric. “ My eyes sometimes glaze over when people start talking” about it, said Gale. But it’s one of the clearest and biggest intra-Republican fault lines. “Pass-throughs” are any businesses whose profits are processed as personal income for their owners. Because some tax brackets are higher than the current 35 percent corporate tax rate, and many are much higher than the average 18.6 percent effective post-deduction corporate tax rate, pass-through owners, who run most of the businesses in America today, often protest that they shoulder an unfair and uneven tax burden. So cutting corporate rates functionally required Republicans to cut pass through-rates as well. The House bill chops the highest pass-through rates by 25 to 30 percent on a certain amount of business income, and stipulates that only some types of firms should get that lower rate. The Senate offers a deduction of up to 17 percent of business income from overall individual taxes. Pass-through reforms get sticky fast. They triggered the first Republican public “no” on the Senate plan, from Ron Johnson, a pass-through owner himself. He and his allies, including some small business organizations, argue that these are paltry cuts that actually widen the tax gap between big corporations and small businesses. They’re also outraged that cuts to the corporate rate are permanent, unlike the pass-through cuts. Republicans sell pass-through cuts as a break for small businesses, said T.J. Helmstetter of Americans for Tax Fairness, because we think of them as sole proprietors like handymen or tiny mom and pop shops. But pass-throughs include firms like hedge funds, law offices, and real estate companies. Actual small businesses already pay lower-than-corporate income tax rates, Helmstetter argued; critics on the other end of the spectrum also make the case that most pass-through cuts just benefit the wealthy. Most observers also agree that special pass-through cuts can be abused. The wealthy may try to “reclassify themselves as pass through entities to lower their individual tax rate,” said Helmstetter. Senator Johnson has made it clear that this is a hill some in the GOP are willing to let tax reform die on. Even White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney had to admit on Sunday that “Johnson has sort of honed in on one thing that we knew was sort of the last big substantive piece of the puzzle and that’s how do you deal with these pass through entities.” He offered no solutions. Peeling Back the Alternative Minimum and Estate Taxes The estate tax takes a one-sixth cut out of an individual’s wealth after they die—but only if they have over $5.49 million in assets The alternative minimum tax (AMT) prevents people making over $130,000 a year from using tax engineering to cut their rates to next to nothing. Neither makes up a huge chunk of federal revenue, and there are cases to be made against both taxes. But cutting them benefits, by definition, only the wealthy, which Donald Trump and his legislative allies have promised their tax plan would not do. Both bills double the amount of wealth you would need to have to be affected by the estate tax, and the House plan phases it out entirely over time. Both kill the AMT. These cuts, like all the bills’ individual cuts, would be temporary. Republicans seem to all agree that these cuts should be part of tax reform, but the optics are terrible—it looks like a giveaway to the Trump children and other wealthy heirs. This move, said Gale, “is obscene, given our need for revenue and given the widening distribution of wealth and income over the past 40 years.” “Without the AMT,” Helmstetter said, “Trump would have paid a 4 percent tax rate on the $153 million in income that we know about for the one year that we have his taxes. Thanks to the AMT, he paid about $38 million… Without the AMT, he’s giving himself a huge tax cut.” Raising the Tax Burden on Students For decades, tuition waivers have not been taxed as income. Though you may not think about them if you aren’t a grad student, these waivers allow many to pursue otherwise unaffordable degrees in research-heavy fields, particularly science, technology, engineering, and math. Waived tuition can be in the tens of thousands of dollars, and were it taxed as income a lot of grad students simply couldn’t afford to stay in their fields. The House bill would do exactly that, though, raising tax burdens on some grad students by up to 400 percent. It would also axe deductions for student loan interest and lifetime learning expenses. And both bills slap a new 1.4 percent tax on large university endowments, claiming they want to see the institutions spend on students rather than stockpile cash. However, observers argue that this will just undermine the security of programs like need-based financial assistance. These policies aren’t just controversial, they’re asinine. They are an effective block on the upward mobility of low-income individuals and on the development skills employers say they need the most in today’s American workforce. As Vox pointed out last week, they only really make sense if Republicans want to stick it to “elite” institutions, which many of them view with increasing ideological suspicion. Public outrage over this has been mounting in recent weeks. And it will only grow as the bills move forward.

Curtis M. Wong,"“Queer as Folk” will get back to its roots in a new reboot. 
Bravo tapped Stephen Dunn, whose credits include 2015′s “Closet Monster,” to write, direct and executive produce a new version of the seminal gay-themed show, Variety reported Tuesday. Though many fans remember “Queer as Folk” as the five-season Showtime series that ran from 2000 through 2005, the reboot will use the 1999 British iteration as its inspiration.  
The UK version of “Queer as Folk” was created by Russell T. Davies and ran for 10 episodes from 1999 to 2000. Davies, who also explored LGBTQ themes on this year’s BBC-Amazon miniseries “A Very English Scandal,” signed on to executive produce the Bravo reboot. 
Though details of the new “Queer as Folk” are scarce, the show will follow a group of club-going friends who find support in the LGBTQ community after tragedy strikes much like both the original British series and the first season of its American counterpart.
News of the reboot comes just months after Entertainment Weekly reunited actors Gale Harold, Randy Harrison, Hal Sparks and other stars of the U.S. version of “Queer as Folk” for the magazine’s LGBTQ issue in June. 
At the time, executive producer Daniel Lipman told the magazine he didn’t see a “Queer as Folk” revival in his future. 
“This was a show about young people trying to find their way. Now we’d have a cast who are all mature,” he said. “If somebody wanted ‘Queer as Folk,’ that kind of energy, you’d have to go back and you’d have to cast young people, and with Tinder and Grindr, it’s a very, very different world than it used to be.”
But “Sons of Anarchy” actor Charlie Hunnam, who starred in the original British series, has said he’d be keen to appear in a reboot if one was made. 
“It was the beginning of my career, so I have very fond memories of it,” he told The Sun last year. “I’m very proud of being a part of that show. I’m very happy when people bring it up.”","Bravo is mounting a new version of the seminal gay series, based on the 1999 British original.",2018-12-19T19:25:06Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",A ‘Queer As Folk’ Reboot Is In The Works,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/queer-as-folk-reboot_us_5c1a6980e4b0ce5184b96760,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c1a922c2200000307deba1d.jpeg?cache=x6g7ROptVB&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,gale,1

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by George Dvorsky to Gizmodo","In 1991, scientists lowered 10 speakers into the water off of a remote Australian island in order to blast a monotonous 57 hertz tone from them for 10 days. Other researchers listened for the distant sound at 15 monitoring stations in ocean basins around the world. This was all being done in the name of science—specifically, to better understand the processes driving climate change. Scientists have been taking the planet’s temperature for decades using thermometers, satellites, and other methods to track just how much carbon emissions have heated it up. But there’s a problem with those measurements: They only gather information about the surface. It’s like feeling your forehead when you’re sick rather than putting a thermometer under your tongue. Understanding just how much the whole planetary system is heating up is a crucial piece of the scientific big picture, particularly if we want to know if climate change has any nasty surprises in store. The 1991 sound experiment was cut off by a powerful storm that destroyed most of the speakers, but still proved wildly successful. “It was a seminal experiment,” Bruce Howe, an acoustic oceanographer at the University of Hawaii, told Earther. “It absolutely showed what it set out to do.” Despite its success, the researchers’ dream of using acoustics to routinely measure global warming has yet to be realized. The planet has been warming ever since humans started pouring carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Thanks to thermometers and ocean surface measurements around the world, we basically know how much: About one degree Celsius, as of earlier this week. We also know this increase would be two or three times higher without the oceans. They take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, which helps reduce its warming impact, though it does make seas more acidic. The oceans also absorb a lot of the excess heat that works down through the water column. That’s the global warming we never really see. But it’s still having a profound effect on the world, either through altering marine ecosystems or ocean currents. These changes can have knock on effects on storm systems, sea levels, and fisheries, all things that matter to us here on land. There’s a network of floats around the world that dive below the ocean surface and take ocean temperature measurements to go with the thermometer measurements we have on the surface of our planet. But there’s no one clear metric to measure all the planetary heat. It’s with all that in mind that Walter Munk, a renowned oceanographer at the Scripps Institute for Oceanography who celebrated his 100th birthday this year, conceived of his plan to blast the ocean with a low frequency sound. The idea is grounded in a few simple concepts. The first is that as water warms, sound travels through it faster. Munk estimated that the speed of sound increases by five meters per second for every one degree Celsius of warming. Salinity can also play a role, but temperature has by far the biggest impact. If you’re regularly monitoring sound in the ocean, you can in theory monitor how much the water is warming. The second is that sound propagates a long ways underwater. In 1960, scientists detonated 200-lb. and 300-lb. charges off the shores of Perth. The sound waves were detected on the other side of the world in Bermuda. That’s a wild story for another time but suffice to say, point proven. For Munk, that meant if you set up listening stations around the world, you could effectively measure ocean warming in different areas as well as the ocean as a whole. Boom, planetary temperature taken. If this sounds complicated, well, it is. There were also issues with “sound shadows” created by continents, and underwater topography that could make calculations more difficult, though they could be overcome if the speakers were put in the right place. But considering that scientists currently use an array of thermometers around the world and satellites coupled with equations to help cover any gaps in coverage to come up with the global average temperature, it doesn’t seem to crazy. In some ways, what Munk imagined was a much more elegant solution. The system would be self-contained and it would take the whole planetary temperature in one fell swoop. There was just one problem: Nobody have ever tried to do it. To start using acoustics to take the ocean’s temperature, Munk needed to prove you could measure the time it took to travel across the ocean to the hundredths of a second. And he needed to find a location to broadcast from that could be heard at multiple other locations. He chose Heard Island, a remote volcano in the southern Indian Ocean about 2,500 miles southwest of Perth. “We have chosen Heard Island as an ideal site for an unimpeded transmission to Bermuda,” Munk said in a 1990 lecture organized by the National Academy of Sciences and the Office of Naval Research. “As a bonus there is also an eastward path to San Francisco, and possibly a path through the Tasman Sea to Coos Bay, Ore.” As the 1991 experiment grew closer, Munk and his colleagues identified 16 listening sites in total. There, researchers would use hydrophones—underwater listening devices—deployed from ships and moored to the bottom of the ocean to hear the 57-hertz sound Munk was planning to play from Heard Island. In early January 1991, Munk pushed off from Perth with a team of scientists aboard the M/V Cory Chouest, a Navy research ship. In addition to the crew, it carried 10 hydro-acoustic low frequency transmitters for the experiment. They looked like oversized stopwatches, and would be responsible for making the sound heard around the world. There was just one thing missing: permits. Late in the planning stages, the U.S. and Australian governments decided the researchers would need them to blast a 57-hertz sound at their planned 200 decibels due to the impact it could have on marine mammals. “The Heard Island Feasibility Test raised the marine mammal question in a big way, and we still must deal with it,” Brian Dushaw, an acoustics expert at the Nansen Environmental Research Center in Norway, told Earther. To appease the marine wildlife community, Munk and his team scrambled to get a a second ship with observers to join them at Heard Island. They ended up commissioning the R/V Amy Chouest to push off with them and ferry nine marine mammal experts from the U.S. and Australia. They still didn’t have permits in hand when the left shore. If they didn’t come through, it would have made the experiment a no-go, but they were issued a week and a day before the test began from the U.S. and Australia respectively. The researchers dropped their array of acoustic transmitters into the sea on January 21, and the countdown began to when the tests would commence. The plan was to begin the experiment on January 26, Australia Day, but the engineers on board wanted to test the transmitters ahead of time to make sure they were in working order. Munk gave them the go ahead. He recounts what happened next in the 1994 documentary One Man’s Noise about his work: “I had lived that day for two years before it started, what would it be like, would we be heard at all? We really didn’t know if manmade acoustic instruments of this kind would be loud enough to received at such distances. Just before the zero hour, the people in the shop asked if they could test equipment... I had gone to sleep when we received a very puzzled fax from Bermuda saying ‘we picked you up and what in the hell are you doing? You’re not supposed to start until tomorrow morning.’ And I thought, ‘Oh, that is just wonderful that that question has been answered.’” The M.V Cory Chouest was able to broadcast 35 times over the next five days before rough seas put an abrupt halt to the experiment. The transmitters were all damaged or destroyed during a storm that churned up 30-foot waves and gale-force winds. But the 35 transmissions (out of a planned 48) were enough to prove beyond a doubt that sounds could be detected accurately across vast tracts of the ocean. Researchers from India to Bermuda to British Columbia were able to record the sound. The results were so accurate, Munk was even able to track the path the sound took from Heard Island to distant points. Using data from a hydrograph on Whidbey Island in Puget Sound, he was able to chart a line from Heard Island through what he dubbed the “Polynesian window” south and east of New Zealand. In contrast, researchers in Japan heard nothing, suggesting that oceanic ridges near Tonga and Fiji may have blocked it. The results didn’t give researchers a whole Earth temperature, but they proved the proof of concept and spurred further research into the topic. A similar experiment took place in the Arctic Ocean in 1994, and the results were later confirmed by submarine measurements. The Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) experiment began broadcasting signals from Pioneer Seamount off central California in 1995 and Kauai in 1997, but both sites were shut down by 1999. Noise from ships and oil exploration have been shown to have negative impacts on species from whales to shrimp. The observers at Heard Island saw no ill impacts of the experiment, though they were limited solely to ship observations. Similarly, the ATOC findings show the experiment had “no significant biological impact,” but there’s still room for more research on what putting a permanent sound system in the ocean would mean. There’s also the matter of getting the public on board, which could be the biggest challenge. “There are three sides to the marine mammal issue: the scientific or what is actually happening side, the regulatory side, and the public relations side,” Dushaw said. “Scientifically, we are in good shape as was demonstrated [by ATOC]. The public relations side lingers, but has died down quite a lot...even though the science and regulatory situation are mostly resolved.” Scientists have continued to use passive listening to monitor ocean health, including monitoring the impacts of climate change on reefs. Howe, the oceanographer at the University of Hawaii, thinks that the advances in passive observing since the Heard Island Feasibility Test could ultimately set up a resurgence in broadcasting again in a way that doesn’t impact marine life. And its value could extend well beyond climate change. “Acoustic methods are one of the few ways to know and measure large scale temperatures. It’s very accurate,” he said. “I look at it as extending our terrestrial infrastructure into the ocean that is our last frontier in some sense.”","In 1991, scientists lowered 10 speakers into the water off of a remote Australian island in order to blast a monotonous 57 hertz tone from them for 10 days.

Ethan Gach,"Team Dignitas won Rocket League s season five championship earlier this year. It was not easy, though, requiring a long run through the lower bracket that culminated in a back-to-back best-of-seven series against NRG Esports. Despite a nail-biter in the final match after NRG tied things up 3-3 with what some have called the best goal in the games history, Dignitas managed to pull it out in overtime. This weekend, theyre expected to do so again. In North America, the fall league has been more competitive, with Cloud9 and G2 Esports taking top spots just ahead of the slightly less consistent Evil Geniuses and NRG. Meanwhile, Dignitas finished its season in Europe undefeated. That earned the team a top-seed going into this weekends championship, meaning it wont play until the second round when it takes on Evil Geniuses. While Rocket League is not stranger to weird ball spins and unlikely upsets, its hard to see any team being able to unseat Dignitas given their commanding performance in arguably the tougher of the two regions. If Dignitas goes on to secure the season six championship as well, not only will three 20-year-olds walk away with a $200,000 pot to split between them, itll also mark Dignitas, whose squad previously won the RLCS finals when they were Gale Force eSports, as Rocket League s latest and best dynasty in the games short but vibrant history. Of course, there are still nine other teams currently in contention who would love to stop that from happening. Matches have already been ongoing throughout today, and theyll continue on Saturday at 1:00 p.m. ET, with the grand finals slated for Sunday at 8:00 p.m. You can watch all of the matches here or streaming in the feed above. Counter-Strike s IEM Chicago 2018 is also this weekend after a long week of group matches. The semifinals begin on Sunday at 2:00 p.m. with the grand finals on Sunday at 3:00 p.m. Those matches will be streaming here. Artifact, Valves new card game, doesnt come out until December, but the company is already pushing its pro scene with a Preview Tournament this weekend featuring a $10,000 prize pool. Games begin on Saturday at 12:00 p.m. with 128 players, followed by a single-elimination bracket between the remaining eight on Sunday. That event will only be available to watch on SteamTV. Finally, the Chess World Championship also got underway today, with the second in a series of matches scheduled for Saturday. While its not an esport, you can still watch it like one, with matches streaming live on Twitch, complete with commentators and a input from randos in the chat. There will also be video of the event itself available over at World Chess Youtube channel.","Team Dignitas won Rocket League’s season five championship earlier this year.

My question is this: what have you gotten in return? While youre putting in crunch time, your bosses are ringing the opening bell on Wall Street. While youre creating some of the most groundbreaking products of our time, theyre pocketing billions. While youre fighting through exhaustion and putting your soul into a game, Bobby Kotick and Andrew Wilson are toasting to their success.
They get rich. They get notoriety. They get to be crowned visionaries and regarded as pioneers.
What do you get?
Outrageous hours and inadequate paychecks. Stressful, toxic work conditions that push you to your physical and mental limits. The fear that asking for better means risking your dream job.

Cory Doctorow,"Jibo was a ""social robot"" startup that burned through $76m in venture capital and crowdfunding before having its assets sold to SQN Venture Partners late last year. 
Earlier this week, reporter Dylan J Martin tweeted a video of a $899 Jibo robot bidding its owner farewell, announcing that the new owners of his servers were planning to killswitch it; the robot thanked him ""very very much"" for having it around, and asked that ""someday, when robots are more advanced than today, and everyone has them in their homes, you can tell yours that I said 'hello.'""
Then, the Jibo performed a melancholy dance.
This is a neat little parable about the danger of the server-tethered, DRM-locked IoT future, a world where robot dogs and even juicers only work for so long as some people in a distant boardroom consider it worthwhile to keep them working (this is also the the McGuiffin of my novella Unauthorized Bread, which appears in Radicalized).
The robots message tells owners to go to the Jibo website for more information on the shutdown, but Jibos website appears to be mostly shut down itself, with broken links and videos.
