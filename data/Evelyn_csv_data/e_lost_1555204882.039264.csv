Mariella Moon,"Randall used to be Snap's VP of Operations until he took on the newly created role back in 2017, around a year after the company released the first version of its eyewear. The hardware lab released Spectacles 2 under his leadership back in May, and while the new version fixed a lot of the old one's issues, it's not entirely clear if it's doing better than its predecessor. Snap said it moved more than 150,000 first-gen units by the end of 2017, but it also took a $40 million loss due to hundreds of thousands of unsold devices. As Cheddar notes, though, Snap sees Spectacles as a core element to its augmented reality efforts, so it's probably not giving up that easily. It's also believed that the team is working on other projects, including a camera-equipped drone. ""Hi team, When Snap Lab was first established, it made sense for our group to be completely separate from the rest of Snap's engineering organization. But from our customers' perspective, these separations will become less and less distinct over time -- as the pillars of Snapchat, Lens Studio, and Spectacles continue to converge. As a result, we've decided to realign the team as a distinct group under Snap's SVP of Engineering, Jerry Hunter. To best facilitate this transition, I also made the decision that now was the right time for me to leave Snap and focus on growing my own company. Sahil Sharma, VP Hardware Development, will serve as acting lead. The rest of our organizational structure remains the same, and Jerry, Sahil and I are all committed to making sure this is smooth and seamless for all of you. We will be holding an All Hands tomorrow (7/10) at noon in the Grotto area of 606 (calendar invite to follow + questionnaire form), to share more and answer any questions that you may have. While this may feel sudden, please know we have been carefully discussing these decisions at the senior leadership level for several months. I'm confident that this is the right next step -- both for me and for this team. The potential here within this group is huge and the world will be so excited over the next decade to see all of your amazing creations. :) For my own next steps, I'll be focusing on growing my own company, where I'll be advising young, private companies, participating in early-stage investing and working on other passion projects. It has been an absolute privilege working alongside this team. I've learned an incredible amount, and it has been a truly awesome experience. Please feel free to contact me anytime and I will always be more than happy to assist any of you with anything I can.

Mariella Moon,"Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer Jonathan McDowell noted that space situational awareness service Space-Track catalogued Zuma. Space-Track adding something to its catalog means that object made it to orbit. However, Navy Captain Brook DeWalt told Bloomberg that the military division has ""nothing to add to the satellite catalog at this time."" It's all conflicting reports all around, and unfortunately, both SpaceX and Northrop Grumman, which built the satellite, refuse to talk. ""We do not comment on missions of this nature; but as of right now reviews of the data indicate Falcon 9 performed nominally,"" the space corporation told Engadget. If the payload truly crashed or disappeared, then this incident came at a bad time for SpaceX. The company is hoping to start ferrying astronauts to the ISS this year and to win more contracts from the Pentagon. Although what happened to Zuma remains shrouded in mystery, McDowell said Northrop Grumman provided its own adapter used to attach the payload to the rocket's final stage. If the adapter was the one that failed to pop off when it was time for Zuma to detach itself, then the incident might not be SpaceX's fault at all. To recap: Normally when you buy a rocket launch, you've paid for ""the payload adapter on the rocket final stage pops the satellite off at the end"". But on this mission the customer provided its own payload adapter, so separation may be its problem and not SpaceX's problem — Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) January 9, 2018 Recap 2: Assume satellite catalog entry is not an error. Still doesn't mean USA 280 is still in orbit, or that it separated from stage 2.

In other words, Im a digital pack rat. And its possible that this weeks Tech 911 letter-writer is as well. And you know what? I dont fault them in the slightest. I get it, I do. Lifehacker reader Larry writes: How can I retrieve old email accounts that were on different phones from a few years ago??? Any help in this matter is greatly appreciated, as I forgot the passwords to some of them. Short. Succinct. I like it. So, I have good news and bad news. There are two different protocols you (or your favorite email-checking software/apps) can use to access your messages: POP3 or IMAP. To keep it simple, POP3 downloads messages from the server to your computer or device, whereas IMAP merely synchronizes your messages between your computer or device and the server. Though I cant think of any apps or services nowadays that dont default to IMAPmostly since I only ever use Gmailits possible that you might have set up your older email accounts to use POP3. If thats the case, and if your email provider defaulted to deleting messages off the server when they were downloaded via POP3 (versus giving you copies of all the mail you receive), youre out of luck. Regaining access to your older accounts wont help you find your older email, since thats all (presumably) been downloaded to your smartphone, laptop, or desktop computer, to name a few examples. If you used IMAP, youre in luckassuming your provider hasnt deleted your account because you havent logged in for a few years. Here are a few of the more popular services and how long theyll wait for you to log in before deleting your account: Yahoo Mail: 12 months Gmail: Google previously gave users nine months of inactivity before they could but not necessarily would delete the account. I believe this policy changed sometime around 20132014, and Google now keeps your account active in perpetuity. AOL Mail: 180 days Outlook.com: 365 days I'm generally pretty organized with my email, and I like to have nothing in my inbox except Read more Read You didnt mention what email services you used, so Id figure that out first, and then go check to see what their account-deletion policies are. If you cant remember what services you used (or even your email address), Id get creative. Search for your name in the primary email service youre using now to see if you send anything to yourself from an older account at any point. If you remember the older providers, run wildcard searches for any mail from their domains with your name in it. This might get tedious, but its a great way to find... yourself. You can also try searching through your computer(s) to see if you have any older documents or files with your older email accounts in them. You might also have saved older logins in whatever password manager you use (if any), which could help you remember your older accounts. If you set up some kind of recovery number or alternate email address, you might also be able to use that to help find the name of your forgotten email accountif a provider allows it. Above all else, all of the major email services have various recovery tools you can use to find an older account, assuming it still exists ( Yahoo, Gmail, AOL, Outlook, et cetera). If youre talking about old email from, say, a job you hadwhich was probably kept on a companys Exchange server, for exampleI doubt youll have any way to retrieve it. If you had an email address from some random place that isnt one of the big providers, you might have to contact them directly for help. And if you had an email address from an old ISP you dont use anymore, youre probably stuck. Anyway, those are a few of the scenarios I can think of related to your question. Let me know what you find outor, at the very least, what email accounts youre trying to recoverand Ill let you know if I can come up with even more specific advice.","I’m the kind of person who hates losing old copies of digital things—photographs, messages, emails, videos, etc. While I doubt I’ll ever take a walk down memory lane and reminisce over random emails I sent in 2007, I don’t like feeling as if I couldn’t do tha…",2018-11-16T15:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",How Do I Recover Old (or Lost) Emails?,https://lifehacker.com/how-do-i-recover-old-or-lost-emails-1830465262,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--JSZSEPVP--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/kqzkrlwhjhbqyisc8atl.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,lost,1

Casey Newton,"On Monday, the bottom dropped out for Alex Jones. After a series of tepid disciplinary actions, which the Infowars host evaded with ease, three of the biggest tech platforms acted in near-unison beginning late Sunday night. And the result is that one of the popular conspiracy performers on the internet has found his reach dramatically reduced. The great de-platforming of Alex Jones began last week, when Spotify and Stitcher removed Infowars podcasts from their respective networks. (Spotify initially removed a handful of episodes before removing whole shows.) On Sunday night, Apple followed suit, removing his podcast from iTunes for violating its rules against hate speech. Apple’s move was followed almost immediately by a rash of similar moves. Facebook removed Jones’ pages, citing repeated hate speech violations. YouTube followed suit, terminating an account that had 2.4 million subscribers. Pinterest came next. By the day’s end, Infowars had three major digital platforms left at their disposal : the open web, Twitter, and its native apps for Android and iOS. Jones lambasted the platforms’ moves, telling The Washington Post : “You’re on the wrong side of history mainstream media,” Jones said in a text message to The Post. “You sold the country out, and now you’re going to pay for it.” Platforms have long been criticized for not only hosting Jones, but finding him a large audience using social features and recommendation algorithms. But pressure on the tech companies intensified last month after CNN’s Oliver Darcy asked Facebook a relatively straightforward question during a meeting between reporters and News Feed executives: How can the company claim to be serious about fighting misinformation while offering Infowars a large and growing platform? “Different publishers have very different points of view,” was the answer John Hegeman, who leads the News Feed, gave Darcy at the time. But that answer only spurred more coverage of Facebook’s contradictory policies. The next week, Mark Zuckerberg fumbled an answer about Infowars by defending the rights of Holocaust deniers, and Facebook found itself in the midst of yet another public-relations crisis. In the end it was hate speech, not misinformation, that got Jones booted from Facebook. But a close review of Jones’ posts to social networks was never going to withstand close scrutiny. A disturbing number of his fans were found to have threatened and committed real-world violence. This April, in a little-noticed incident, he repeatedly used an anti-transgender slur on Facebook and appears not to have been disciplined for it at all. Until Monday, tech companies’ policies seemed to offer more protections to Jones than they did for families of the victims of Sandy Hook, one of whom moved seven times in an effort to escape the harassment of Jones’ followers. (Jones has spent years promoting the lie that the government faked the Sandy Hook massacre as a pretext for taking their guns away.) There will surely be much more to be said about Jones in the days ahead. For tech companies, the question is less what to do about Jones — the answer has been clear for some time now — than what to do about everyone copying his playbook. Misinformation and hate speech spread quickly on their platforms, amassing audience in the millions. The platforms would do well to ponder why that is, and what they could do about it. Democracy Facebook to Banks: Give Us Your Data, We’ll Give You Our Users Facebook has been talking to banks about bringing customers’ financial information into its system, report Emily Glazer, Deepa Seetharaman and AnnaMaria Andriotis. Facebook pushed back hard, saying the data would only be used for chatbots. Strategists raise alarms about Facebook delays in approving Hispanic political ads Ads that target Spanish-speaking Facebook users are facing delays, creating complications for political advertisers, report Michael Scherer and Elizabeth Dwoskin: New procedures adopted by Facebook in response to Russian meddling and allegations of racially discriminatory ad practices often require several days for the company to review political ads targeted to ethnic groups, while ads that target broader audiences are approved immediately, said strategists for three liberal organizations, Priorities USA, Latino Victory and Win Dem PAC. Another group that supports conservative causes has experienced the same delays when buying ads that target Spanish-speaking or Hispanic audiences on Facebook, according to an official there, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. Several groups banned by Facebook had strong similarities to Twitter accounts linked to Russia six weeks ago Facebook found similarities between public tweets and Facebook accounts that were later found to be part of a coordinated influence campaign, report Elizabeth Dwoskin, Tony Romm and Craig Timberg. But it took the company a relatively long time to link them together: In May, Twitter turned over to Congress documents describing the activities of more than a thousand accounts it tied to the Internet Research Agency, the Russian organization that spread misinformation in the 2016 election. Congress publicly released the documents in mid-June, and Facebook began to scrape them for clues to shadowy operators on its network, said Andy Stone, a company spokesman. Facebook’s engineers, he said, were not able to tie the information to corresponding Facebook pages, even though some shared a name and posted similar content, two shared a creation date — and one had an identical logo. Stone said that the trove lacked key technical details, such as an IP address, phone number or email, which made it hard to establish a clearer link. This Researcher Mapped Anti-Muslim Content On Facebook. She Says It’s “Way Worse” Than She Expected. Ishmael N. Daro reports that despite regularly touting its ability to quash hate speech using artificial intelligence, Facebook has been slow to remove anti-Muslim posts. I’m looking forward to reading the paper he mentions here: Squire, an Elon University computer science professor, analyzed hundreds of far-right Facebook groups over a 10-month period to map their connections for a research paper, “Network Analysis of Anti-Muslim Groups on Facebook,” that she will present at the Social Informatics conference in St. Petersburg in September. While she is no stranger to online vitriol, she said the anti-Muslim rhetoric on Facebook particularly “alarmed” her. “I’m looking at these and I’m just thinking, if you substituted any other religion, it’s so bad no one would think that this is OK,” Squire told BuzzFeed News. “Why is this still up? What is going on?” Lawmakers Pressure Google Over “Deeply Troubling” China Censorship Project A bipartisan group of six US sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Friday asking for answers about its plans to build a censored news app for China. A Generation Grows Up in China Without Google, Facebook or Twitter The Times finds that people who have never used Google, Facebook, or Twitter are not particularly curious about it. Campaigns on their own as cyber threats roil midterms The work of protecting campaigns against cyber threats still falls mostly to the candidates — and there’s lots of work to do there, reports WHYY: Every month for the last 18 months, [Sen. Kamala Harris’] office has discovered on average between three and five fake Facebook profiles pretending to be hers, according to a Harris aide. It’s unclear who creates the pages, which are often designed to mislead American voters about the ambitious Democratic senator’s policies and positions. Elsewhere Facebook is now a major mobile browser in U.S., with 10%+ market share in many states People are browsing the open web — from inside Facebook! While Facebook’s use as a mobile browser was still far outweighed by Safari in most cases, due to the dominance of Apple’s iOS in the U.S., the social networking app has achieved mobile browser market share of around 10 percent in many states, Mixpanel found. Do tech workers make enough to buy a home? At Facebook, the median salary is $240,000, and 51 percent of employees say they cannot afford a home in the Bay Area. For journalists, is it time to delete your old tweets? Probably! Launches Facebook is redesigning Pages so it’s easier to interact with local businesses The old reason to create a page for your business was to get organic promotion through the News Feed. But now the News Feed is about your friends, destroying organic promotion, so pages need a new reason for being. Facebook’s latest answer is to essentially serve as a free website builder for small businesses, a la Squarespace, stuff the pages with call-to-action buttons, and monetize it with ads. This all feels pretty weak to me, at least from a utility perspective. Takes The High School We Can’t Log Off From Twitter is high school, says Jennifer Senior. ( High school never ends, responds Bowling for Soup.) Clay Shirky, one of the shrewdest internet theorists around, has noted that the faster the medium is, the more emotional it gets. Twitter, as we know, is pretty fast, and therefore runs pretty hot. (Emotional tweets, research has shown, travel more swiftly than anodyne ones.) We often become creatures of our limbic systems when we tweet. Our self-regulation deserts us (been there); our prefrontal cortex, responsible for executive function and impulse control, goes offline; we become reward-seeking Scud missiles, addicts in search of a fix. We become, in other words, teenagers, who are notoriously poor models of self-regulation — in large part because their prefrontal cortices are still developing and their dopamine circuits are pretty busy seeking stimulation. The psychologist Laurence Steinberg describes adolescents as “cars with powerful accelerators and weak brakes.” The neuroscientist BJ Casey deems them “more Kirk than Spock.” Facebook and Instagram’s time management tools miss the point The notion of “Time Well Spent” has been coopated and is rapidly losing its power, says Simone Stolzoff: “Time well spent” is having its Kendall Jenner Pepsi moment. What began as a social movement has become a marketing strategy. Even Mark Zuckerberg’s mission for 2018 is “to make sure the time we all spend on Facebook is time well spent,” a clear reference to Harris’ work. But it’s easy to co-opt “time well spent” as a value once you’ve already captured the attention of 2.2 billion users. When companies like Facebook check the time-well-spent box with a few cosmetic design changes, they get credit for putting a bandaid on the symptom without addressing the disease. And finally... ’Snapchat dysmorphia’: Patients desperate to resemble their doctored selfies alarm plastic surgeons The hot new disease of right now is Snapchat dysmorphia: Doctors have spotted a trend of people bringing in their own selfies, usually edited with a smartphone application, and asking to look more like their photos, according to an article recently published in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery by researchers from Boston University School of Medicine’s Department of Dermatology. The phenomenon is known as “Snapchat dysmorphia,” and it’s causing widespread concern among experts who are worried about its negative effect on people’s self-esteem and its potential to trigger body dysmorphic disorder, a mental illness classified on the obsessive-compulsive spectrum. Body dysmorphia is a serious issue, and we shouldn’t make light of it. On the other hand, I’m not really sure that “Snapchat dysmorphia” — roughly defined as “the wish to look better in photographs” — is really a new phenomenon. At least, until people start asking for dog faces.

Devindra Hardawar,"Just look at the Pixel 3 XL, OnePlus 6(T), and LGV40, which all launched this year. And even Apple made a more affordable all screen phone with the iPhone XR, after helping to kick off the trend with the iPhone X in 2017. Without the headphone jack, there's more room to cram in other hardware, and it also helps to bring screens all the way to the edges of phones.
Samsung, the biggest headphone jack holdout, excluded a 3.5mm port on the China-bound Galaxy A8s. While recent case leaks suggest that the upcoming Galaxy S10 will keep the jack, it's unclear how long Samsung can keep shoving it into their flagships. Few other companies have enough engineering resources to make room for a 3.5mm port while also trying to remove camera notches and screen bezels. Sorry headphone jack fans, there's no turning back now.
And to be clear, I'm saying this with heavy resignation. Even though I'm mostly using wireless headphones with my iPhone X (the Libratone Track+ and a variety of noise canceling cans), not a day goes by where I don't miss that little port. I feel a pang of regret every time I'm hanging out with friends and can't easily plug my phone into older speakers or an aging car's sound system. I have several 3.5mm to Lightning dongles, but, inevitably, they're never around when I need them. (It's truly upsetting that Apple isn't even including them with new iPhones.)
At least the rise of all-screen smartphones is something; at first we gained nothing by losing headphone jacks. Phil Schiller's infamous ""courage"" remark seemed like a glib response to dumping the port, but eventually Apple explained that it needed more room inside of the iPhone 7. Still, that phone kept the fat screen bezels from the iPhone 6S and didn't add any significant new features to justify losing the jack. Motorola, meanwhile, said it needed to dump the jack to make the Moto Z so thin. It was an attractive phone, but the trade off just wasn't worth it.
When Google's Pixel 2 arrived, a more useful reason for dumping the jack emerged. Google Product chief Mario Queiroz told TechCrunch that it was about ""establishing a mechanical design path for the future."" That's likely what Apple was doing with the iPhone 7, as well. ""We want the display to go closer and closer to the edge,"" Queiroz said. ""Our team said, 'if we're going to make the shift, let's make it sooner, rather than later.' Last year [2016] may have been too early. Now there are more phones on the market.""
Similarly, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei told TechRadar that removing the headphone jack gave them more room to add hardware in the 6T. It has a larger battery than the previous model, as well as a fingerprint sensor right under the screen. He also noted that 59 percent of their customers were already using wireless headphones this year, so the transition away from the port is less painful than it would have been a few years ago.
It might be hard for wired headphone fanatics to stomach the move losing the 3.5mm port just for prettier smartphones. But at least it's more palatable than it was a few years ago. One of the most glaring issues early on was that you couldn't listen to music with a USB-C or Lightning dongle while also charging your phone. Today, wireless charging is more ubiquitous, and some third-party accessories also let you charge and plug in a 3.5mm device.

Aimée Lutkin,"Every year, for many, many years, I would promise myself I’d lose weight. Sometimes I would make a little headway, but mostly I didn’t. Then in 2017, it happened. Like most huge changes, it was actually lots of little choices adding up to something big. Here’s how I did it. Know Why You Want To Lose Weight For a very long time, I felt conflicted about wanting to lose weight at all. We get so many confusing messages about how we should feel about our bodies, both positive and negative. I had kind of landed in a place of trying to accept myself wherever I was at, which was good, but it meant I also sometimes felt embarrassed about wanting to change. It’s so personal, but I would say don’t make a decision about how to treat your body based on what other people expect from you. The fact is, my knees hurt and I was often lethargic and sick. I’ve been consistently more energetic, less depressed, and less frequently ill since I began exercising. Changing my diet cured my almost daily heartburn. Being thin isn’t the same thing as being healthy, but in my case, this weight loss was undeniably a benefit to my health. Teach 600 people to eat more vegetables and less added sugar for a year, and it turns out they’ll… Read more Read Commit To Something For 30 Days At the beginning of 2017, I did the Whole 30. I am not advocating for this diet specifically. I’d originally intended to give up dairy as a New Year’s resolution, but found out a big group of friends were embarking on the Whole 30 journey, and wanted to do something with buds (more on that later). In fact, the Whole 30 is not necessarily a diet that’s even devised to cause weight loss. It eliminates things like sugar, alcohol, and dairy, plus a whole bunch of other delicious stuff. I did ultimately lose weight, because a lot of the things on the No-No List are my favorite snacks, like cheese puffs and ice cream, but you could easily gain weight on it as well. Neither potatoes nor bacon are outlawed, for instance. And anything with calories can add up to too many calories in a day. But because I was sticking so strictly to the rules, I was hyper aware of my eating choices; though I always ate enough to be full, that’s where I’d stop. This was a big change, because I love overeating. Weight loss concerns aside, the Whole 30 is extreme, and I’m not necessarily recommending extreme diets. For the vast majority of people, they can’t be sustained for any length of time, and most gain back the weight they lose. If you aren’t being careful, you could potentially make yourself sick. For me, at that time, it worked as a way to change my relationship to food, but I think there are lot of simpler ways to do the same thing. I’m recommending that you choose something and do it every day for 30 days. In the past, I often made resolutions and gave up too quickly. I’d say, “This is me now! I only eat veggies and protein for dinner, forever! I work out every day, forever!” But forever kept being too long. It felt like a lot of hard work that didn’t immediately produce results. When I was on the Whole 30, I knew it was only for 30 days, so I saw it through—and there was a real turning point that I’d never reached before. My pants fit looser. I started to get better at things at the gym that had seemed impossible before—I could jump rope longer, do deeper lunges, and for the first time, a burpee. These little accomplishments built up and made me want to stick with it even more. Pick something. A push-up challenge, walking for a half hour a day, a change in your diet. You likely know what it is that needs to change. Sticking with something will show you what you’re capable of and what the results can be. You will want to keep going. Do It With Friends Making a change in how you take care of your body can be very isolating, because so many of our social activities revolve around food. That feeling can be mitigated with a support network. I was lucky that first month, because a group of friends were doing the Whole 30 at the same time. We made a private Facebook group to support each other, complain, give tips, and share recipes. It is true that people who are getting into fitness never shut up about it, so find a crew of people who you can blab at unashamedly. I’ve also done text threads, email accountability check-ins, healthy brunch outings, and GroupMes. If you’re not surrounded by people interested in talking about how many steps you got in today, join other open groups on Facebook or fitness subreddits. Most calorie counting apps have a social component where you can post pictures of food with other members or talk about your struggles. It feels corny at first, but it may save your relationships with people who can’t hear any more about how alert you feel since giving up sugar. It turns out a bunch of you did get Fitbits last year—or even longer ago—and have managed to keep… Read more Read Keep A Food Diary And Count Calories Most of my weight loss came from dieting, but I wasn’t that strict about how much I ate in the beginning, more what I ate. I found this to be a better way to think about it. I eventually shifted to counting my calories on an app, specifically one called Fat Secret. I realize this is an extremely rude name, but it helped me count macros when I spent another month (30 days!) doing the ketogenic diet. Figuring out how you want to manage food is different for everyone; some people feel they quickly get obsessive when counting calories and it becomes an unhealthy focus. Some people find the work of writing down what they eat tedious, and prefer to have general rules. You know you. But here’s what I got from both. Writing down what I ate made me think about it a lot more. I would go through my day and consider what I’d eaten and when, which then made me consider if I’d eaten because I was hungry, stressed, sad, or just because it was in front of my face. Reviewing those habits made me more conscious of what I was doing, even if it didn’t necessarily stop me from eating a family-size bag of chips. With calorie counting, it quite literally made me understand exactly how much I was eating every day. Which was a lot! When I switched to keto for a month in early Spring, I needed to count calories to track my macros. Keto is very high fat and low carb. Your macros intake is basically how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates you’re getting. It’s complicated enough counting calories, but that was too much math for my meals. An app really helped, and it was a very different way of looking at food intake. It also make me realize how many calories were in certain foods I thought of as healthy. They still technically were—replacing cookies with a salad is probably much more nutritionally beneficial to you, but if you keep adding on extras, the calorie balance might end up being similar. You’ll likely feel good, which is great, but not actually lose weight. Once I saw how many calories the food I was eating added up to, it got a lot easier to cut back on the emptier stuff in my meal plan, like snacks made from nuts or dried fruit. That stuff isn’t bad in moderation, but there were times I’d house a bad of mango slices only to realize I’d eaten as many calories as I did at dinner. Just have make your decisions from a place of information rather than assumptions. We don’t often discuss the mental impact of restrictive diets like Whole30 (no “inflammatory”… Read more Read Don’t Do Something That Makes You Miserable Okay, so diet is likely most of what will make you lose weight. But you should still exercise, because it makes you feel freaking great. Back to the 30 days thing: exercising regularly and not abandoning it after a week and half meant experiencing what exercise does besides make you painfully sore. It improved my mood, it made me feel like eating healthier, and it gave me energy throughout the day. And my thighs are also extremely toned. Here is the caveat: do something fun. There are lots of philosophies about what the most efficient type of exercise is, what will make you lose weight or build muscle. My personal preference is to lift weights and mix in cardio with HIIT, when I’m keeping things simple. But your mind and emotions are a part of the physical experience. If you’re doing something that bores you or makes you anxious, you won’t want to keep going. Try different stuff. Groupon often has class deals so you can try out barre or pilates or a dance class. ClassPass is also an option, and many studios have beginner lessons at a discount. Try a bunch of different things until you find the thing that makes sweating down your butt crack worth it. Core exercises will build up your abs, but they do nothing for the layer of fat on top of them.… Read more Read Go Somewhere Near Work Or Home For Exercise I just said try a bunch of stuff, which implies exploration. I stand by that as an intro to getting your bod moving again, but I found that having a gym I could go to near my home made it so, so much easier. It was revelatory. Sometimes on tough days, I’d tell myself, “Just walk over there. You don’t have to exercise, just go to the gym because it’s two blocks away.” And then I’d go and inevitably work out, at least a little. If you can avoid road blocks to exercise, like a long-ass subway ride, it’ll help with motivation. Supplement Every Day Workouts With Special Stuff When I first started working out consistently, I had a membership at an extremely cheap gym. They ran a special on half hour personal training sessions, so I bought a package that probably added up to what a more traditional gym would cost. Having a trainer I saw regularly helped focus my other workouts, and eventually pushed me to go to the gym on my no-trainer days, so I could keep up with him. Having a regular, cheaper work out option and the occasional splurge of a trainer or class can help push you to the next level and provide motivation on a daily basis. Now I like to plan work outs with friends as a special treat, or go to a dance or spin class for variety. Yes, I have become a person who considers biking in the dark for an hour a “special treat.” January is the month for getting your house in order, and no aspect of one’s life gets quite so… Read more Read Don’t Make Hunger Your Diet Plan Letting yourself get too hungry will kill all your best intentions. Our minds get exhausted making the “right” choice again and again, and feeling like an empty sack isn’t the same thing as developing a nutritional diet with a calorie deficit for weight loss. Carry snacks. Throw some cashews in your bag, then in your mouth when you’re feeling peckish. It’ll be cheaper than looking for stuff on-the-go, and you’ll be less likely to cave and eat an ice cream burrito at midnight when you’re exhausted and starving. On that note, outside the month of Whole 30 and Keto, I mostly didn’t commit to specific diets. They were both experiments for me, to break up the old food patterns in my life and see if I could feel better doing something else. They’re pretty simple things—I order less when I go out, then wait and see if I want more; if I’m stressed I try to go for a walk or call someone before eating my feelings; I keep olives in the house so when I am having an insane salt craving I can eat a few instead of a bag of fries. In general, I think outlawing something you love to eat forever is a mistake. It makes it forbidden, and that much more tempting. But taking a break can be a good way to figure out the difference between what you want and what you need. I find eating food with a high fat content and lower carb content makes me feel more full, especially if there are protein and fibrous vegetables involved. It can just be an oily dressing if you don’t like dairy. Sometimes eating a salad is less exciting than an entire pizza, but if I tell myself, “Eat the salad first, then see if you want pizza,” I often don’t eat the pizza. And I’ve gotten my daily greens, too. Treat Your Body Like You Love It Now For a long time, I would wear pants that were too tight and shirts that were too big. The tight pants reminded me I was uncomfortable with my weight, the big shirts would hide my figure. Every once in awhile, I would panic and try to lose weight through intense measures, which would always fail. Then I’d retreat even further. Wanting things to change all at once kept me from appreciating where I was at, but it’s all a process. You should be there for yourself every step of the way. Building body strength and making lifestyle changes in your diet takes a while. In the meantime, work on thinking nice things about yourself. Get clothes that fit and make you feel cute, including some stuff you like wearing to work out in. Taking care of your body is just a part of taking care of yourself, so make sure you believe you deserve that care. You do. Don’t Make It About Your Character Similar to what’s above, it’s important to not make this a moral issue. It’s not. For years, if I failed to stick with my resolutions, I used that failure as a way to berate or shame myself. That just made fitness a subject I wanted to avoid, because it brought on lots of negative emotions. We shift our energy around to different priorities. When you’re ready to prioritize fitness, you will. Maybe you’ll only make it two weeks of your 30 days, but if you keep trying throughout the year, those weeks will add up. Start a small good habit now and see how far it takes you.","Every year, for many, many years, I would promise myself I’d lose weight. Sometimes I would make a little headway, but mostly I didn’t.

The company doesn’t spell out exactly why this is, but one popular theory is that it’s to stop AirPod thieves who need a new case for their stolen earbuds. What’s interesting, though, is that Apple’s exact policy seems to change on a case-by-case basis. One AirPods owner says the company was able to pull up the serial number using their Apple ID, but most commenters on the thread say Apple wasn’t much help at all. If you do lose your case you can also retrieve the serial number by charging them in another case. Try borrowing one from your friend, or use a demo unit at the Apple Store. Just make sure not to press the button on the case or you’ll lose your old serial number. Of course, you could avoid all of this by just storing a picture of the serial number on your computer. While you’re at it, you might as well create a folder to save all your gadget serial numbers moving forward.

Jon Fingas,"The trick is to equip the suit with sensors that track motion and position relative to that of a relatively stationary object like a spacecraft, with alternative methods if one system or another doesn't work. Since GPS isn't exactly viable in space, it could use star tracking or vision-boosted navigation to get bearings. Draper is hoping for an autonomous system that would trigger thrusters all on its own, but it's open to the possibility of a manual system that uses an in-visor display and sensory cues to guide astronauts homeward. This is only a patent, and it isn't guaranteed to go into space any time soon. However, NASA has been backing Draper's research -- it's interested in advancing spacesuit design.

Lydia Horne,"I used to help my mom with her Facebook account. Our weekly tutorials were fraught, ending in either frustration (""No, Lydia, for the last time, you may not poke your father"") or metaphysical musings. (""But what, really, is a wall?"") One particular point of contention was the use of exclamation points. I found them ""festive"" and ""sparkly""; my mother countered with ""abrasive"" and ""indulgent."" Every caption or status I drafted was rejected if it contained a slammer. I vowed that when I grew up and moved to a place far away, I would use all the exclamation points I wanted.
Well, the real world proved hostile to my youthful enthusiasms. I realized my mother was not alone in her regime: Journalists and grammarians everywhere preach a wary sermon on the subject of exclamation points. If anything, the punctuation mark has only fallen in favor. ""Digital communication is undergoing exclamation-point inflation,"" writesThe Atlantic's Julie Beck. Perhaps that's why we now need sixsix!!!!!!to have the same effect as one. Then there's the question of gender. Plings, we're told, make us women sound friendly but also dumb (#classic). ""Burn your bra, burn your keyboard,"" I chanted, suddenly deeply moved. ""Free yourself from the shackles of prescribed punctuation.""
In the end, Mother got it her way: In a new-year, new-me effort to conserve my emotional energy, I decided to scrub my correspondence of punctuational loudness, to go on what I called a deep exclamation point cleanse. The Goop de grammar. My goal was one month of zero bangs on email, text, social media, Slack, dating apps, letters (yes, letters), notes to my roommateseverything.
It started well enough. The first day, I awoke feeling superiormorally, intellectually, spiritually. I no longer relied on a pedestrian symbol to express excitement or mask anxiety. When the first text rolled in, a thank you for a dinner party I hosted the night before, it was no sweat. ""Oooooo are you kidding????"" I replied. ""You were a DELIGHT."" If I couldn't have exclamation points, I would have question marks. AND I WOULD YELL.
As texts from other guests came, I gave them the same treatment. This was kids' stuff. Then, my first bomb arrived. A woman who had recently asked for my number, which I supplied, asked me out on a date. Not only did I need to decline the invitation, but also I wanted to tell her why: I'm straight. These were treacherous waters to wade through as a conflict-averse millennial, and now I was rendered defenseless without my diffusive exclamation point.
I stated the truth.
Ambiguous winky face aside, I was amazed. Never in my years of overthinking textual relations had I ever dreamt that unadorned directness would get me the result I wanted. ""Maybe there's something to this,"" I thought. My cleanse would accomplish what so much Jungian therapy had not: the unification of my fractured psyche.
As the day wore on, my main problem was speed. Crafting a response took twice as long as it used to. My untrained fingers ached for that seductive mark while my ""rational"" brain shooed them away. Then I remembered I had a secret weapon, an ace up my sleeve that was made exactly for diluting potentially fraught conversations with some color and sparkle: emojis. ""EVERYONE WILL GET A PURPLE HEART,"" I cried.
It didn't end at purple hearts. Soon my frequently used emoji collection resembled that of a person who split her time between a kindergarten classroom and a rave in Ibiza: brilliant blue butterflies, dancing women in flouncy red dresses, teeny glasses of red wine I never intended on consuming, hands that clapped and high-fived and waved. Oh, and the smiley faces. Faces with Cheshire Cat grins, faces with flaming red cheeks, faces with tiny grabby hands popping out of their necks. No floating emotive head left unturned, each carefully parceled in ones or twos so they'd appear bigger on iMessage.
By nighttime, though, I was somewhat off my emoji roll as I dashed from bus to home to evening plans. People were picking up that something was different, my effusive iBanter inexplicably subdued. On my way to meet for dinner, my friend texted:
My dear friend unravelled right before my eyes, all thanks to my dumb experiment in self-preservation. Without exclamation, I lost warmth and tonality. No one knew what I meant anymore. I found it no coincidence when, a few days later, my brother told me to try being ""more open to the universe.""
At work, I was protected under the guise of professionalism. What sounded terse to me could be easily translated as direct communication. Email became my linguistic safe haven, the only place I didn't worry whether people would infer meaning. It's not like anyone's on email to make friends.
The next day in the office, I encountered another difficulty: cross-platform consistency. Notifications from Slack sirens and Gchat ghouls blared, each one beckoning me to fail. But there were some benefits. Typing on a computer instead of a teeny cellular screen gave me the room to spread out. I still felt like I was being mean, but now my hostility was less spatially confined. At work, I was also protected under the guise of professionalism. What sounded terse to me could be easily translated as direct communication. Email became my linguistic safe haven, the only place I didn't worry whether people would infer meaning. It's not like anyone's on email to make friends.
Back in my social world, I was floundering. I started using extra vowels and em-dashes to add some architecture to my sentences. I was quickly informed that nothing incites fear more than a sentence that trails off, and that my attempt at introducing a modern ellipsis to the iMessage ecosystem (I thought maybe using only two dots would provide an urban feel) just pissed everyone off.
Former friends turned-hecklers doubted my integrity. ""Oh, you're still doing that?"" they said. ""Lol bet you almost used one right there."" My better angels restrained from using exclamation points when texting with me or would place them (safely) inside parentheses. A few even tried to join me, but their sober stints invariably ended when they sniffed something more exciting, leaving me trudging alone into sanctimonious platitudes.
About three weeks in, I wanted affirmation. Did my new style make me sound smarter? Better? More mature? I couldn't post this life update on Instagram like someone might a new haircut, assessing the value of a decision based on metered likes. I asked my long-distance best friend, with whom I text nearly every day, how she perceived the change.
Accusations aside, this was positive feedback. I had reached a level of blasé intimacy that I previously thought was reserved for men in their 20s. But internally, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had become a shadow of my former self. I looked at myself in the mirrordid I look older? Where did the joie de vivre go, the twinkle in my eye? I used to be fun to talk to; people even said I had texting game. Notably, the few times I accidentally let an exclamation point slide (which, let me tell you, had the shock factor of spilling coffee all over the really nice couch at a new friend's house) were in moments of sincere expression: congratulating a childhood friend on her promotion, making a valentine for my dear old dad, Slacking my boss that something was actually OK. Stripping these moments of personality seemed cruel, barring me from participation in a new social economy where emojis are the accepted currency, where GIFs rain down like dollar bills.
""Will you continue?"" the people asked, as my month finally came to a close. I knew I had enjoyed certain aspectsthe power trip was amazing, and adopting a cohesive language at work made me more efficient. I thought I would simply reintegrate into exclaiming society, while being perhaps more sparing and deliberate in my usage this time. But set free from my cleanse, exclamation points still feel off-limits. I can't bring myself to press the damn key, even now.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"The archaeologist was Elena Korka, now the director of Greeces Office for Supervision of Antiquaries and Private Archaeological Collections, and the sarcophagus led her and her team to more rich tombs, ceramics and other finds and finally to the announcement last week that they had uncovered Tenea itself. Under a small village called Chiliomodi, the team excavated a dense residential area of stone walls, floors of marble, stone and clay, distinctive door openings and pottery dating from the fourth century B.C. to late Roman times. Coins, urns and other artifacts proclaimed that over centuries the descendants of Trojan prisoners of war came to live in comfort and luxury, in contact with East and West. Why is that important? For most people, simply looking through a newly opened window into the distant past satisfies a basic human need to know and requires no further justification. Still, does the discovery that a mythical city few ever heard of exists really change anything? The question is often put to archaeologists, and the usual answers about learning from history or stripping away layers of myth are not particularly convincing. The real answer is personal, and probably differs from person to person, but for each of us a look at what came before is important for many of the same reasons that art, literature and history are important: They open our minds, they lead us to reflect, to better understand ourselves and our world. For archaeologists like Dr. Korka, there is also the profound thrill of the chase, the expectation that every discovery holds the promise of an even greater one.

Now’s the bit where I’m supposed to tell you it’s all fake, and I only lost it in the cryptocurrency trading simulation game Bitcoin Flip. But no, I actually bought $400 worth of bitcoin back when it was cheap, then left it in the hands of the Mt. Gox online exchange, which then lost it. And yet I still recently bought another $210 worth of bitcoin, which has already dropped to $172. This is not investment, this is gambling. I would have done better just playing Bitcoin Flip. Bitcoin Flip is a free game for the web, iOS, and Android. (Google recently kicked it off the Play store, but the creators, a group of Latvian students who previously created the stock-market simulator Trading Game, are working to get it reinstated). In the game you can trade 24 cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Monero, and Dogecoin, based on real-life prices pulled from various online exchanges. Below the sophisticated price graph for each currency, the game provides a short description and history of that currency, making this a decent educational tool for beginner crypto enthusiasts. Bitcoin Flip plays safer with your pretend money than anyone would with your real money; the game only lets you trade small amounts of your $5,000 pot at a time. But if your playing style at all resembles mine, you will immediately begin losing money anyway. The game has efficiently reminded me that I have no business trading actual crypto, or really any financial instrument more complex than a baseball card. But if you’re pretty good at making a profit in the game, you might decide you want to actually buy some crypto. The game helpfully provides links to crypto exchanges where you can buy real currency and lose real money.

Arielle Pardes,"In Chicago yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook stepped into the auditorium at Lane Technical College Prep High School and told an audience about the future of education. It was Apple’s first education-focused event since 2012. Back then, Apple still had the lion’s share of the education market—over half of devices shipped to schools that year ran on iOS or Mac OS—and it had a new plan to replace raggedy, expensive textbooks with cheaper digital versions made to read on a tablet. The iPad was two years old, and while it was pricey, it seemed poised to change the way students could learn. The company had been in classrooms for years, as far back as the Apple IIe, which Apple donated to schools by the thousands in the early 1980s. Apple wanted to bring its devices into every school in America, to usher in an era of computer literacy and education. And perhaps, to introduce Apple-branded devices to kids early enough to make them lifelong customers. For a while, that worked. Apple designed a heap of devices over the years specifically for use in the classroom. For generations of American school kids, learning to type, write papers, and research school projects was something you did on a Mac. Not anymore. Today’s classrooms are powered by Chromebooks and, to a lesser extent, Windows laptops. These are sturdy, versatile, and inexpensive machines that have revolutionized how schools incorporate technology into their classrooms. Steve Jobs wanted to put a computer in the hands of every student. But Chromebooks—not Macbooks—have made that vision a reality. Gaining a foothold in the classroom isn’t just a way to sell thousands of computers in bulk. It’s a way to capture a generation of young people and teach them what a computer is. Last year, Chromebooks made up a whopping 58 percent of computing devices shipped to schools. That’s up from 50 percent in 2015, and 38 percent in 2014, according to data from market research firm Futuresource. New Apple devices, meanwhile, dropped to 19 percent—down from 50 percent in 2014. Even Microsoft is gaining an edge with its Windows 10 Laptops, designed for use in schools with the palatable price point of $189. So Tuesday's event wasn't just a standard product announcement. It was Apple's chance to reinsert itself into the American classroom. Some speculated that the company would introduce a heavily discounted iPad, and new software to rival the likes of Google Classroom, a popular and free web service that helps teachers grade assignments and share information with their class. When Apple's executives took the stage, they did show off a discounted iPad —but at $299 for schools (versus $329 for consumers), it wasn't the price point many had hoped for. This cheaper iPad now supports Apple's Pencil—but of course, that’s sold separately ($99 for consumers, $89 for schools). And there’s no Smart Connector, the port that makes it possible to plug-in accessories like keyboards (also sold separately). Apple execs danced around the auditorium stage showing how to annotate digital books and create doodles using the Pencil. They debuted a new app, Schoolwork, for teachers to dole out digital assignments, and updated an old app, Classroom, that lets teachers check in on how students are using their iPads. As with any Apple event, this one was full of sparkle and shine. But it's hard to ignore the economics of what Apple is offering: The iPad is still twice the price of a Chromebook, which start at $149, and almost twice the price of Microsoft’s Windows 10 laptop, which costs $189. ""Money is really a big issue,"" says John Ross, an education technology consultant. ""If you're a school district with over 45,000 students, then $299 times that many kids adds up to a lot. Whatever’s cheap and whatever works—that carries more weight than brand loyalty."" Chromebooks, which have come to dominate classrooms, gained popularity around 2012. While Apple was pushing its iPad into schools, the Chromebook offered something simpler, and much more affordable. The laptops run on Chrome OS, which Google licenses to multiple hardware vendors for cheap or free. That creates competition and keeps costs low. For schools, there's no better selling point; Chromebooks are about as cheap as it gets. But it’s not just price. Chromebooks are also rugged and durable, built to last class after class of kids whacking at their keyboards. They actually have keyboards—something Ross says is basically essential for any classroom above the third grade. Chromebooks update automatically, over Wi-Fi. Everything gets stored in the Cloud, which makes it easy to move between devices and work collaboratively. For $299, you can give a kid an iPad—without a Pencil, without a Bluetooth keyboard—with a suite of brand new educational apps that students and teachers alike will have to learn how to use. For the same $299, you could buy two Chromebooks, stocked with the suite of Google products (Docs, Gmail, and Classroom) that everyone already likes and understands. Gaining a foothold in the classroom isn’t just a way to sell thousands of computers in bulk. It’s a way to capture a generation of young people and teach them what a computer is. Google has taught thousands of young people how to use email, share documents, make presentations, and store files on one simple operating system, which shows up on all kinds of hardware. When it comes time for these kids to head off to college and buy laptops of their own, guess where they’ll look first. Apple's strategy seems to be showing educators all that its machines can do—from products that improve classroom organization to applications that bring textbook material to life in augmented reality. One demonstration Tuesday involved a new app that allows students to dissect a digital frog in AR. But other companies are working toward that future too. Microsoft, in partnership with education company Pearson, is developing a mixed reality curriculum aimed at schools and sells its HoloLens headset at a 10 percent discount to students. The difference? Microsoft also offers a no-frills laptop designed to help teachers and students get through the day. As the Apple team prepared to set up its keynote at Lane Technical College Prep High School, the school sent around an announcement about the event: ""Apple is making some great upgrades to our facilities, like updating the auditorium, refinishing areas inside and out, replacing lighting, touching up paint, and more,"" a schoolwide email read. ""And the great news is that they’ll leave behind all of the improvements they make."" In most schools, basic infrastructure upgrades for little-to-no cost count for more than new technology that lets you dissect a frog in augmented reality. But Apple’s competitors already know that.","Apple's new, cheaper iPad still can't compete with Chromebooks in the classroom.",2018-03-28T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",How Apple Lost Its Place in the Classroom,https://www.wired.com/story/how-apple-lost-its-place-in-the-classroom/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5abae6adf156f371db609071/191:100/pass/iPad_Everyone_Can_Create_photos_03272018.jpg,wired,Wired,lost,1
ELIA RATHORE,"Two months ago, while walking through the old market in Sharm el Sheikh by myself, I tried to just embrace it. I had no plan, no internet, and no direction whatsoever. I wandered into a textile shop and saw elaborate designs that reminded me of Lahore. I wandered into a hidden tea market and bought two bags of tea that smelled like mangoes for my sister. I wandered into a tiny local skin care shop, where I had a two-hour conversation with the salesman and bought the best rose face mask Ive ever used. It doesnt even have a name.
During a recent trip to South Africa, my friend Natasha Khan found herself off track while hiking a trail near Cape Town. She got separated from her group as she stopped to take photos of the various flora and fauna. Hurrying to find them, she went the wrong way and ended up on a main road, which just happened to be near an African penguin sanctuary.
There was a man sitting on the side of the road, she said, with the biggest, cheesiest smile plastered on his face.
His smile caught her eye, so she walked over. He was surrounded by small tin cups and plates, on which he had hand-painted penguins. They talked for awhile and she bought some cups for herself and her friends. Now she keeps them on her shelf to remind her of that moment. That little diversion turned out to be one of the best memories she has from the trip.

Adam Rogers,"The allegations in the Justice Department’s indictment of the Internet Research Association—the Russian organization that allegedly took aim at the 2016 presidential campaign—build, page after page, in their boldness. Covert trips to the US, money spent to hire Hillary Clinton lookalikes to be paraded around in cages, digital spycraft, and identity theft...this stuff is nuts. It was all designed to look like Americans were behind it. But listen and read closely and you can find a quieter bit of signal, clues that something was wrong in the language that the Russians used. Allegedly. The examples in the indictment seem, to my ear, to be non-idiomatic in a very specific way. So I called an old friend, a native English speaker who spent several years in Russia and is fluent in the language, and asked her to take a look. Take, for example, these two sentences from advertisements that the indictment alleges the IRA bough on social media via fake US identities and Russian bank accounts and credit cards, or with PayPal: “Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is.” So, the article—the “a” or “the”—is out of place. “Satan” is a proper name, a singular entity, but the use of the indefinite article “a” has the connotation that that there could be other Satans, perhaps. “Hillary is satanic” might have been another approach. Russian doesn’t use articles, my friend says. And native Russian speakers, when they switch to English, classically screw them up. They also throw in “the” where it doesn’t belong, and “a” too. Or they leave them out. Another thing that people get hung up on going from Russian to English is past tense (“I wrote”) and past participle (“I have written.”) Here’s another ad: “Hillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa Caucus.” Idiomatically, you’d probably want to write that as “committed voter fraud,” most likely. The same category of error shows up in an email allegedly from another fake identity sent to Florida grassroots groups: “We got a lot of volunteers” instead of the more correct “we’ve got a lot.” Whoever wrote the message had gotten it right in a previous email. From that same email, the construction “who are okay to be in charge” seems likely to be a too-direct translation from idiomatic Russian, says my friend, as does the phrase “a huge lot of followers” in another email. That latter one is probably, she says, a direct translation from an expression that’s better as “a huge quantity.” If these messages indeed sound, well, kinda Russian, not set off alarm bells? Why did this campaign of persuasion actually work? I speculate: Language has become more and more informal on the internet. As the linguist David Crystal has argued, the internet allows for much more informal writing; social media perhaps even more so. And my colleague Clive Thompson has written about how deceptively complex the new syntax of the net can be. Of course, some of us think that is something up with which we should not put. (LOL JK.) Of course, it’s also possible that people who aren’t professionally verbal don’t think about such stuff too seriously, or maybe they don’t see it. And it’s true that some folks on Twitter, at least, will occasionally brush off a bot or cyborg account by pointing out a linguistic quirk. That’s what the comedian (and very good speaker of English) Paul F. Tompkins for a good punchline on Twitter earlier this week. Either way, some classic translation errors probably should have stood out. They didn’t. But will they get missed the next time? Maybe nyet.","To troll effectively, Colonel Gant, you must think in Russian!",2018-02-17T02:28:49Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","In the Russian Investigation, Clues Were Lost in Translation",https://www.wired.com/story/in-the-russian-investigation-clues-were-lost-in-translation/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a8782bcfe6ef84cd1052c2a/191:100/pass/RussiaElection.jpg,wired,Wired,lost,1
THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"In an accounting that resulted from Judge Sabraws order, stemming from a legal challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the government acknowledged that nearly 3,000 children had been separated from their parents since the policy was announced. But on top of that, the inspector general said, thousands more may not have been counted.
Over all, the total number of children separated at the border is unknown, according to the report. Nor was it clear how many of these children had yet to be reunited with their families.
Judge Sabraw was right when he wrote that the governments responses to the chaos it caused belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our Constitution. This is particularly so in the treatment of migrants, many of whom are asylum seekers and small children.
The report describes department officials essentially grasping in the dark to come to terms with what had happened. Because the tracking systems in use at that time were informal and designed for operational purposes, according to the report, immigration officials were unable to provide a more precise estimate or specific information about these childrens placements.
Department officials had to search more than 60 databases to identify indicators of possible separation, such as an adult and child with the same last name apprehended on the same day at the same location. Officials also had to review 12,000 case files and contact the departments shelters to find children who had been separated from their families.","Milka Pablo, 35, wore an ankle bracelet as she held her daughter Darly Coronado, 3, as they wait for a bus soon after being reunited after four months apart.",2019-01-18T01:47:32Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Lost Children of the Trump Administration,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/family-separation-border-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/18/opinion/18separation-2/18separation-2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1
Rita Liao,"China’s largest car-hailing company is facing relentless pressure from all fronts. Beijing-based Didi Chuxing reportedly lost a staggering 10.9 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in 2018, according to financial data that Chinese news site 36Kr obtained.
For some context, Uber posted a net loss of $939 million on a pro forma basis and an EBITA loss at $527 million during Q3 2018.
Didi has not responded to TechCrunch’s inquiry about its losses, but an internal letter leaked in September offers a glimpse at the depth of Didi’s troubles. According to the memo from founder and chief executive Cheng Wei, Didi had been operating in the red for six consecutive years and lost 4 billion yuan in the first half of 2018. At this moment, the transportation giant’s predicament appears to be multipronged.
Public backlash
The ride-booking app capped off 2018 with a bleak outlook after two female passengers were killed by their Didi drivers in separate instances, drawing ire of the government and triggered a nationwide backlash underpinned by a #DeleteDidi campaign that’s reminiscent of the #DeleteUber movement.
Didi responded with a fold of security measures, including stricter identity checks on drivers and a major reorganization to place customer safety ahead of growth. Hitch, the carpooling service that was complicit in both accidents and was popular among riders for its relatively cheap fares, is suspended indefinitely, a move that could exclude the more price-sensitive consumers.
Cash-burning model
Didi’s struggles had preceded the passenger murders. Cheng admitted in his memo that the company’s expansion was getting out of hand. “The expansion frenzy planted seeds of trouble and our internal system couldnt keep up with our expansion.”
During the first six months of 2018, Didi shelled out about $1.7 billion in subsidies for drivers and steep discounts for passengers as competition intensified, Bloomberg reported citing sources. In the entire year, Didi burnt through a total of 11.3 billion yuan ($1.67 billion) on driver subsidies according to the 36Kr report.
Subsidies have played a key role in the rise of Didi and many other aspiring consumer-facing services in China. Investors dole out big bucks for early movers to gain market share rather than strive for profitability. That tactic has helped catapult tiny startups into billion-dollar businesses such as bike-rental service Mobike, but it has also led to the dramatic fall of some, Mobike’s peer Ofo being one alarming example.
Regulatory hurdles
Following Didi’s safety incidents, Chinese authorities hastened their pace to reinforce rules they had long laid out for the fledgeling industry, and some of the policies prove costly to uphold. For one, ride-booking drivers now need to obtain two licenses — one for the drivers themselves and the other for their vehicles to operate commercially.
The new requirement discourages part-time drivers as the costs of owning a commercial vehicle outpace the returns of taking up the gig work. Didi has tried to neutralize the constraint by offering test preps to drivers and teaming up with car rental businesses to equip drivers with the licensed vehicles. But these moves are set to incur new costs for Didi’s already money-burning business. The mobility startup was mulling a multi-billion-dollar initial public offering in 2018 that could value it upwards of $70 billion, Wall Street Journal reported last April.
New rivals
Another stumbling block for the firm is the swarm of new contenders eyeing a market long dominated by Didi after it swallowed up competitor Uber China. Neighborhood services marketplace Meituan, for instance, began to offer shared rides last year though it later put a hold on the capital-intensive new business to stay focused on its dining and hotel-booking units. On the other hand, traditional automakers, including a few that are state-owned such as BAIC, are charging full speed ahead by luring drivers with more favorable commission rates.
These newcomers have a long way to go before they could threaten Didi’s share, but Alibaba has a tool that can potentially help them grow. The ecommerce titan is not competing directly against Didi. Instead, its AutoNavi map service doubles as a ride-hailing platform that lets users book cars from a list of third-party operators. The model in effects levels the playing field for smaller players to challenge Didi, as they all compete on equal terms to court AutoNavi’s 1 billion daily active users.","China’s largest car-hailing company is facing relentless pressure from all fronts.

LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES,"The opening monologue in the published script asks the audience to consider the likelihood of an infinite number of planet earths. And then: It would be very helpful if as you watch this play you were to imagine that the play takes place on one of those slightly different planet earths located billions of light years away from our own.
Spectators, of course, dont always do as theyre asked. Mr. Yew remembers that at Victory Gardens, everyone brought their garbage, really, to the play; whatever they were thinking about the election came into the theater with them. Some got upset, worried that Hillary would harm the real Mrs. Clintons chances.
That same spring, right after the Chicago run, Ken Rus Schmoll directed a production at the Philadelphia Theater Company. After the election, though, few other stagings followed. (Through a spokeswoman, neither Mr. Hnath nor anyone affiliated with the Broadway production would comment for this article, but Mr. Yew said that the playwright had been revising Hillary.)
The Hnath work thats truly taken off is A Dolls House, Part 2, which opened on Broadway in April 2017 and, according to American Theater magazine, is the current seasons most-produced play. The first Broadway show for Mr. Hnath, who until then was a downtown darling known for brainy experimentation, it won Ms. Metcalf her first Tony.
In Dolls House, she played Nora, Mr. Hnaths reworking of Ibsens classic character a strong-minded, convention-breaking woman, a figure important to the cultural imagination and much deliberated there. The same could be said of Hillary Clinton, except of course that she is also a living human being.
There is a certain logic to both of these plays, and both of these famous characters, appearing on Broadway post-pussy hat written by the same playwright, performed by the same actress.

Aimée Lutkin,"If you find someones lost wallet on the ground, you can be a good Samaritan and lazy: just drop it in the blue box.
Redditor u/joecat2112 posted this helpful tidbit in r/LifeProTips, simply writing:
 If you find a lost wallet in the US, you can drop it in a USPS mailbox and they will return it to its owner free of charge.
This sounds a bit too good to be true, but a few commenters said this had actually happened to them, like u/Alwaysshittingmyself who wrote:
This worked for me recently. Lost my wallet and someone [must] have thrown it in the mailbox. The usps put it in an envelope marked it as found in mailbox and I got it back in a couple weeks. I need more consequences for my actions.
Results, however, may vary. For one thing, the wallet must have some identifying information in it, preferably an I.D. with an address. You also have to assume that the person who opens that mailbox is trustworthy, or at least as trustworthy as you, and they will follow through and return it. (And you have to assume that a USPS employee will get to the box before a potential scammer does.)
On that point, former Postmaster Lars LaRue told Quora in 2018 that the obligation to mail lost wallets is actually a part of the postal code specifically covered in the USPS reference manual 507 Mailer Services. Its not just a nice thing they sometimes do. LaRue says you should use a blue mailbox, so no one can grab the wallet except the postal worker, but you can alternatively bring it to a government building or post office. And make sure the contents are secure if youre throwing it into a mailbox:
Wrap the contents with a rubber band or in a plastic sandwich bag if the contents are loose. This will assure all the items in the wallet are returned with the wallet.
Again, results may vary. Commenter u/MR_TACO_11 on Reddit said that theyd tried to bring an I.D. to a post office to no avail:
I tried to take an ID I found to a post office. The clerk looked at me like if i was stupid and said there was nothing she could do. They didnt even ask anyone else even after I asked if they could ask their supervisor...
And YouTuber Mark Rober conducted a country-wide lost wallet experiment to see how many lost wallets were returned to him via the mail. Not all of them were:
The OP admitted that they got this tip from Rober to begin with. If the video doesnt convince you to use the USPS and youre still wary of the people who deliver your mail everyday, you can always ship that wallet yourself.

Michael Hardy,"As a kid growing up in Cleveland, Seph Lawless loved going to amusement parks like the nearby Geauga Lake, which traced its origins to 1887 and featured one of America’s oldest wooden roller coasters, the Big Dipper. “I really loved the atmosphere—I loved hearing the roller coasters going up the hill, the click-click-click, the screams as people came down,” Lawless recalled. “The fireworks, laying on blankets...I can almost smell it.” Geauga Lake closed down in 2007, a victim of declining attendance and poor management. Today it’s a weed-choked wasteland of crumbling rides and drained watercourses. Lawless captures the park’s deteriorating condition in his new book, Abandoned: Hauntingly Beautiful Deserted Theme Parks, which features 13 such parks across the world, from Joyland Amusement Park in Wichita, Kansas to Berlin’s Spreepark. The book is part of a larger project that Lawless calls Autopsy of America. For the past several years the photographer, who works under a pseudonym, has been crisscrossing the country photographing abandoned houses, factories, shopping malls, and other images of national decline. His work resonates with Americans on both sides of the political aisle. Of all the subjects he’s photographed, though, Lawless said his amusement park series has caused the biggest reaction on social media. “There was such a huge response from the general public, not just here in America but all over the world. Millions of people went to these places when they were open, and it’s very nostalgic for them.” Lawless found it relatively easy to sneak into most of the abandoned parks, but some proved more challenging. He had to climb up Beech Mountain in North Carolina to capture images of a creepy Wizard of Oz –themed park, complete with its own yellow brick road. There were occasional legal problems: Disney threatened to sue him for copyright infringement after he posted images online of the company’s old River Country park in Florida. (Skyhorse Publishing included them in the book anyway.) To make the decaying parks look even more ominous, he shot most of them either right before or after a rainstorm. Why are so many amusement parks closing down? “I think the fact that we’re now entertained by our phones plays a role,” Lawless said. “We’re just so inundated now that we rarely want to go out and meet other people. These were communal spaces, places where you went as a kid. These were chat rooms before chat rooms existed.”",Photographer Seph Lawless traveled the world to capture images of childhood paradises lost.,2018-01-02T15:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",These Abandoned Theme Parks Are Guaranteed To Make You Nostalgic,https://www.wired.com/story/abandoned-theme-parks/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a3d595377a03325bdaea539/191:100/pass/5_Enchanted%20Forest-5.jpg,wired,Wired,lost,1
Brendan Nystedt,"Back in the days of dial-up internet, it was commonplace to build your own computer. Instead of walking into a Best Buy or logging onto Dell's website to shop for a complete unit, you'd assemble a desktop PC yourself using standardized, commodity parts purchased either online or at a store specializing in computer components. These days, most consumers have only ever bought pre-fab systems, no assembly required. However, many gamers and computer hobbyists still prefer to roll their own boxes. Doing so means you maintain total control over how the computer turns out, and a successful DIY build is a point of pride. Also, knowing your way around the inside of a PC makes it easier to replace a single piece of a broken-down system instead of just junking your whole rig and buying a new one. Most consumers have only ever bought pre-fab systems, but many gamers and computer hobbyists still prefer to roll their own boxes. I am embarrassed to admit that, even though I worked in IT for a number of years and written about tech even longer, I have never built a PC from scratch before. I've put together barebones kits (like Intel's tiny NUCs ), and I've repaired and upgraded countless systems, but never have I brought a new computer into the world that I could call my very own. There's a snag to assembling a PC in 2018, however. Exorbitant DRAM costs and the inflated price of graphics cards—thanks to their central role in the cryptocurrency mining trend—mean it's more expensive to put together a decent rig than it was even just a few years ago. That's why I thought the new AMD Ryzen chips were an appealing option. These brand new processors combine AMD's latest processor technology and high-speed Vega graphics cores together on a single chip. They're useless to Bitcoin miners, but the graphics capabilities are robust enough to play plenty of games. This makes Ryzen an excellent platform for topsy-turvy times. If you're into games, you could build a Ryzen system today, then drop in a discrete Nvidia or AMD graphics card as an upgrade once their prices come back down to sane levels. Personally, I didn't need a gaming rig when I set out to build one, but the simplicity of relying on a twofer chip like this seemed like a logical way to lower the complexity and price of the build. Sure, you could always just buy a game console like a PS4 or Xbox One S, saving both money and time. But a general-purpose computer can also be used to manage media and take care of schoolwork. And then there's that whole pride thing. To prepare, I watched dozens of YouTube videos and read a bunch of articles on PC building. I also called in parts from component manufacturers like AMD, SanDisk, Corsair, and MSI. I crossed my fingers, broke out my screwdrivers, and put everything together. Here's what I discovered about computers, and myself, by building my very first PC. Getting Started: Pick Your Core PC Parts The first thing you need to know: there are an overwhelming number of components to chose from. If you're used to configuring a MacBook with a few mouse clicks, this exercise will feel like a trip to Home Depot in comparison. It's important that first-time builders (like me!) understand the anatomy of a system. There are six major parts that make up a computer like the Ryzen-based PC I built. Processor : The brain of the machine. This is where your data will be crunched. Motherboard : The backbone of any system. This intricate, chip-stuffed circuit board is where the processor and RAM live, and where your plug in your SSDs, hard drives, networking cables, and peripherals. RAM : Temporary, short-term storage for tasks. In a Ryzen system like this, where the graphics chip and the processor are combined, RAM serves double duty, handling the main memory and the memory for the on-screen graphics. That means it's worth buying faster RAM, but faster RAM is also more expensive. Power Supply : This heavy brick of a thing converts power from the wall into the power your motherboard and processor require. You'll need to decide on the rest of your components first so you know much muscle your power supply will need. It's ideal to have a little extra juice for any future upgrades. Storage : Hard drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) that act as long-term storage. HDDs have more capacity and are cheaper; SSDs are smaller, pricier, but way faster. Case : Where all the above components are installed. It's the box, but you'll have to navigate the case's design when routing cables and installing components. Also, be sure to pick a case that fits your motherboard, power supply, and the rest of your components. Since a few companies leant me some parts in the interest of journalistic experimentation, assembling a parts list was a quick process for me. The resulting PC I built with these parts is powerful, but also more costly than I'd like if I were paying for this out of my own pocket. If you're more focused on being thrifty, I've also put together a cheaper build you can use as a starting point. My Build AMD Ryzen 5 2400G processor with Vega 11 Graphics: $169 MSI B350 Pro AC Motherboard: ~$100 (retail pricing not available) Corsair Carbide Air 240 case: $80 16 GB G.Skill DDR4-3200 RAM (2x8 GB): $254 256 GB Sandisk Ultra 3D SSD: $79 Corsair RM650 Power Supply: $109 Reading the reviews and perusing tests that enthusiast sites have run, I think that there's way better value in going with the cheaper Ryzen 3 2200G and some other lower-priced components. The Ryzen 3 chip has slightly worse graphics performance and only four processor cores (no hyperthreading to help out) but if you shop carefully, you'll be able to squeak by paying less than $400 for everything: The Budget Option AMD Ryzen 3 2400G processor with Vega 8 Graphics: $99 ASrock A320 Motherboard: $50 Fractal Design Core 1000 case: $35 8 GB HyperX Fury DDR4-2400 RAM (2x4 GB) $100 256 GB Sandisk Ultra 3D SSD: $79 Corsair CX450 Power Supply: $30 Prices fluctuate, but my total on the parts for the cheaper build was around $395. It's worth noting that the motherboard I selected might have an older firmware incompatible with the Ryzen 3 2400G, but if it's not up-to-date, AMD will send you a chip for free that'll let you fire it up and run the necessary updates. This cheaper list of parts is just the basics. It doesn't have Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, but you could add that stuff with USB or a PCI card if you choose. If you want to make sure all your parts are compatible, hit up PCPartPicker and build your dream system there—the site will flag any potential snags before you buy. One thing to remember is that when you build a PC, you don't automatically have Windows included. You'll have to buy a license from Microsoft or another vendor and make a USB key to install it. If you don't plan on playing games or need Windows software, consider a flavor of Linux! Ubuntu is a great place to start and it's completely free. Admittedly, Linux support is still early for these chips and the jury's out as to whether it's ready for real-world use. It seems like April 2018 is when the Linux kernel will be fully updated to support Ryzen APUs. Building the PC I've repaired plenty of computers, but this was my very first build. Naturally, I made a ton of mistakes when I tried to assemble all these parts. There are many great tutorials and videos out there you can refer to— this one from Paul's Hardware is a great place to start—but once I got started on my build, I relied as much as possible on the included user manuals to get everything hooked up. Here's what I learned. Watch Out for That Fan! The first thing I did when I got my parts was assemble the motherboard. This entails installing the processor, RAM, and the heatsink that goes onto the processor to keep it cool. AMD includes a heatsink in the box that works fine, but there are plenty of crazy aftermarket options you can grab, including self-contained water-cooling systems. When you put these parts together, be sure to discharge any static buildup and work on a non-metallic surface like a wood table. Or you could just assemble the motherboard on top of the cardboard box it comes in. The processor mounts into a socket that catches its pins. I had to lift a metal lever, orient the chip correctly (look for the golden triangle on the chip—it lines up with a triangle on one corner of the socket), drop the chip into its slot without pushing it in, then return the metal lever to the down position to lock the chip in place. Then, I installed the heatsink and fan on top of the processor. This part has a thermal paste pre-smeared on its bottom that fastens the aluminum heatsink to the chip, making for more effective heat transfer. But, I made a mistake. The tiny motherboard had all its slots and ports crammed next to each other and the little black fan atop the heatsink has an AMD logo that bumps out. The first time I installed it, the little logo bump blocked one of the RAM slots. I had to uninstall the heatsink, clean and replace the paste on the heatsink and chip, and reinstall the fan. Pay attention—if you have an asymmetrical cooling solution, be sure it's not going to interfere with any other components. After I got the fan hooked up and the RAM installed in the motherboard (these chips slot in—check for correct alignment with a notch in the middle and press it down until the latch clicks), it was time to inspect the case. Scope Out Your Case This Corsair case is on the smaller side—more of a cube than a tall-and-wide rectangular prism like most PC towers. Since the mini-sized motherboard I chose hardly takes up any space inside the case, I had all the elbow room I needed for a graphics card and additional hard drives. It's worth it to buy a bigger case if the bulk isn't a concern. I familiarized myself with the case's layout, like where the hard drives go, where the power supply mounts, and which standoffs will support the motherboard. The case comes with the screws you'll need to secure everything, and mine even included some zipties to help manage cables. Installing the power supply was pretty simple, and it only needed 4 screws. Then, I installed the motherboard. Well, actually, I installed it twice. You see, each motherboard includes a stamped metal shield that fills in the gaps around the ports on the motherboard. I thought it went on after the board was screwed in place, but it turns out it needs to be slotted into the case first. Only then can you slot the ports into the metal shield. Whoops! Tiny Cables Are a Pain The motherboard needs to be hooked into all your devices. The power supply unit I used in this build is what's called ""fully modular,"" which means that you can select the cables you need, and leave the rest off to eliminate unwanted clutter. Otherwise, PSUs have a ton of cables and you'll have to deal with the unused power connections dangling inside your case. I hooked up cables for the motherboard, and to power up the SSD. You also need to plug the board into your case—the power buttons, audio plugs, and USB ports on the front of your computer don't just magically work, they have to connect to something on the motherboard. There are special headers for each kind of plug scattered around the board, so you'll want to check your manual for the location and function of each grouping of pins. Easily the hardest part of the entire build was plugging in the cable that goes to the power buttons on the front of the case. These tiny pins need to be plugged in a certain way, and they're unbelievably minuscule. These tested my patience. There's also a hookup for the case's fan—in this case, there was one header on the motherboard, but three fans installed into the case. I used a splitter I got off Amazon to use this one header to power two fans instead of just one. Then there's the SATA cable for your SSD, which plugs into the motherboard. Boot It Up After creating a Windows 10 installation USB stick with another computer, I was ready to fire up my creation for the first time. Thankfully, all my components agreed with one another and the machine booted up. I installed Windows 10 onto the SanDisk SSD, and I set up Windows, which has become a very easy process over the last couple of years. Of course, there are hardware drivers you'll have to hunt down and install, but Windows did an admirable job of automagically recognizing most of my components. I ran some quick tests to make sure everything was functioning properly. Charm the Snakes After I was sure everything worked, I spent some time routing cables in a way that made the inside of the case looks a lot tidier. In the Corsair case I used, almost half of the case can be filled with snaking, messy cables so that you won't have to see them through the clear acrylic window on the other side. This was fun at first, but when I noticed the front USB ports had stopped working, I panicked. Even though it's shaped in a way that should prevent incorrect insertion, I had managed to put the USB 3 cord in the wrong way. When I unplugged it, there appeared to be a pin missing. A quick Google search turned up a diagram, labelling the ""broken"" pin as simply an empty spot. So, I didn't break the plug after all! I breathed a sigh of relief, and made myself a cup of tea as a reward for not completely borking up my first self-assembled PC. Gaming and Performance The Ryzen 5 performed well, especially considering it's a $170 chip. Comparable chips from Intel cost a bit more at around $180, but only include weak Intel UHD graphics. The graphics in both the Ryzen 3 2200G and 5 2400G, according to smarter, techier folks than myself, is roughly in-line with the Nvidia GeForce 1030—a part that'd cost around $100 on its own, without the main processor attached. I ran some standard benchmarks (like the ever-popular 3DMark Fire Strike and Time Spy tests) on the Ryzen in order to make sure it lived up to the hype. Unsurprisingly, it basically does. My benchmark results lined up with those published around on the web, although trying out Middle-earth: Shadow of War was a little underwhelming. The game occasionally suffered from tearing and stuttering, but held it together when the action got tense. Of course, there's a chance I just have the settings all wrong, and PC gamers will probably leave angry comments on this story, but them's the breaks. The consensus seems to be that for popular multiplayer games like Rocket League, Destiny 2, and Overwatch, either Ryzen APU will give you enough juice to play, albeit at reduced settings. To Console or Not to Console? I touched on it briefly above, but it's a worthwhile question: should you just skip building a PC altogether and just buy a gaming console? A few years ago, this wasn't a very common line of thought, but options like the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X bring pretty astounding performance to your home for only around $500. Even though I kept a budget in mind for this story, you could buy an Xbox One S and a low-end PC laptop like an HP Stream or a PS4 and a Chromebook —mix and match whichever combination suits your needs and you're still only paying half a grand. Exercise Your Right to Repair But, then again, building your own PC is far more rewarding than just unboxing a PlayStation and calling it a day. In an age when disassembly is discouraged, with repair rights constantly under threat, this isn't simply a fun project. It's an educational exercise of an increasingly rare sort. Sure, it tickled my contrarian side to stick it to the big electronics companies who don't want you tinkering with parts or fixing your stuff. But more importantly, I found it surprisingly fulfilling to build a machine with my hands. If you do it, I hope it'll give you a new appreciation for the technology we've become so reliant on. Whether you want to learn more about how computers work, or if you just need a new rig and want to save some cash, I highly recommend picking up some screwdrivers and building your own machine.

Jonathan Shieber,"Another day, another stock market setback for once high-flying technology companies, which have lost roughly $1 trillion in the latest stock market slide. Shares of the core group of consumer technology companies including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, and Netflix are falling again — contributing to the big indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 sliding into negative territory for the year. This collapse is thanks in part to rising interest rates that have investors looking for a more stable return profile than placing bets on high-growth technology companies. There’s also some concern that maybe growth won’t be so high for these technology giants as they enter their teenage and twenty-something years as public companies. It’s also happening against the backdrop of an overall economic picture that looks less rosy for the United States. Single family housing starts, which are considered a bellwether for the nation’s economic health are still down from their highs, despite multi-family housing starts picking up. None of this is particularly good news for startups or venture investors. Indeed it could impact planned IPOs for 2019, which has been billed as the big year when several later stage companies were to make their public market debuts. Those public offerings were supposed to give investors liquidity and bolstering the argument for the billions of dollars which investors have poured into high tech startups over the past decade. If the IPO window closes, which looks likely should this slide continue, investors might be less inclined to open their wallets for startups looking to raise cash. That could, in turn, present problems for companies with high burn rates. The declining value of tech stocks will also impact liquidity in other ways as companies become more conservative and will likely spend less on mergers or acquisitions that provided another avenue to exits for startup companies. In all, this is tenuous time for the tech industry and it might mean the beginning of the end for this current boom cycle.","Another day, another stock market setback for once high-flying technology companies, which have lost roughly $1 trillion in the latest stock market slide.

The Democrats had fallen to such a woeful level in Ohio state government that unions felt as if they had no choice but to make friends, or at least nonenemies, with some Republicans, in hopes of staving off anti-union measures such as right-to-work legislation and elimination of prevailing-wage standards. For years, unions in the Midwest have rightly prided themselves on delivering the Democrats far higher margins among white working-class union members than among their nonunion brethren. But Mr. Trump had strained that bond in some unions, drawing support from many members even as their leaders had remained nominally committed to Hillary Clinton. Most unions were back on board with the Democrats in Midwestern federal and statewide races this year. In state legislative races in Ohio, though, unions hedged their bets. The Ohio Education Association, for instance, endorsed 13 Republicans in state House races and three in State Senate races, while staying neutral in some others. If we were just looking at this as a partisan exercise and to the winner go the spoils, wed have been on the outside looking in, and we cant let that happen, said Scott DiMauro, vice president of the Ohio Education Association. Republicans have supermajorities in both houses, and weve got to work with both parties to make progress on key issues. Joe Weidner, communications director for AFSCMEs statewide Council 8, gave a similar rationale. We dont just push the button for the Democrat, he said. Its for the people who are behind us and will support us and well support them. Party is important for us; we align a lot with the Democrats. But we also have Republicans we align with. Seen from one side, this was realpolitik. Seen from another, it was self-fulfilling fatalism, consigning the unions Democratic allies to permanent minority status.","Unlike many young Ohioans, Taylor Sappington, 27, of Nelsonville, decided to stay in his hometown after he graduated from college.",2018-11-16T11:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why the Perfect Red-State Democrat Lost,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/opinion/sunday/taylor-sappington-ohio.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/opinion/18MACGILLIS03/18MACGILLIS03-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1

You know the ones: where a do-gooder rescues a stray dog from the side of a highway, and we watch his post-rescue evolution from a frightened, malnourished animal to a happy, tail-wagging cuddle monster.
Lets say youre put in the position of finding a lost cat or dog who needs rescue. What do you do when you find an animal without an owner? Its more complicated than you might think, especially if the animal in question is aggressive or hostile. 
From capturing the animal in question to state holding laws, heres everything you need to know about capturing (and maybe keeping) a stray animal:
Get a sense of the animals demeanor
So youve spotted a stray dog or cat. According to Steve Gruber, the director of communications for the Mayors Alliance for NYCs Animals, you need to be aware of the potential risks if you try to capture it. Anyone attempting to rescue a stray dog or cat needs to be super careful that you dont put yourself at risk of being bitten or scratched, he said. If you do feel any degree of uncertainty, thats okay, too! Well get to that in a minute.
So youve chosen to capture the critter. Ideally, youre in an area with an enclosed fence, so they cant run away. If not, you could lure them with food to coax them in a particular area where they cant escape, like a fenced-in back yard.
According to the American Humane organization, you should approach the animal slowly and keep your voice quiet (so you dont scare them). 
If its a dog and responding in a friendly demeanor (which means theyre not trying to bite you or are not visibly scared), you should be able to slip a leash around his or her neck and walk them to your home or car. If you dont have any kind of restraint in your car (say, a secure carrier), the American Humane organization recommends calling your local animal control to catch the animal, instead.
Owning a dog is a priceless experience, but it also takes a lot of hard work. Getting started is

Capturing a cat, however, is either very easy or very difficult, according to Gruber. In my experience, youre far less likely to easily catch a cat outdoors, unless he/she is just so friendly that she walks right up to you and goes into a carrier, he said (a feral cat is very likely to resist a carrier). 
If its an aggressive dog, you can contact your local animal control and report its whereabouts. Theyll catch the animal, and if you want, theyll likely give you the option of fostering.
Unfortunately, some animal control organizations will only catch a cat if its injured. If thats the case, Gruber recommends calling a local cat rescue who will do the deed for you, or at the very least, help provide a humane cat trap (which usually consist of a simple cage and some bait. You can find these at places like Home Depot).
Check the animal for ID
A dog or cat very well may have a tag with their owners contact information. If they have one, voila! All thats left is to contact the owner. 
The American Humane organization still recommends filing a found animal report with your local animal shelter, in case the owners unavailable. Shelters usually keep a database of found animals in their area. You can provide a photo of the animal to the shelter, too. Itll make it easier for an owner to find their pet.
Not to long ago, my cat started throwing up a lot. After expensive tests and X-rays, it turned out

If they dont have a tag, you can bring the animal to a veterinarian who can scan them for a microchip (according to Gruber, most vets shouldnt charge for the process. If youre concerned about the bill, he added that local shelters can likely do it for free). 
If they do have a microchip, it will likely trace the animal back to an owner or a shelter. And if they dont, well, the odds that youre a new pet owner have suddenly risen. Some shelters will offer to take the animal for you, if youre not ready to be a parent.
Post on local websites
So the dog or cat in question has no microchip or tag and youve filed a report with your local shelter. The next step is to post fliers, both physically and digitally. 
Post fliers with the photo of the animal at local veterinarians offices along with a method of contacting you (unless you want strangers spamming you, create a burner email address). Also, post on local websites, like Craigslist or NextDoor, where an owner or their neighbors might recognize the animal. Meanwhile, check these websites in case you find any lost-animal listings and recognize the critter in question.
Accommodate the animal as best you can
So: a strange animals spending the night with you! If you already have a pet, its best to keep them separated to avoid any confrontation, even if theyd look great in an Instagram together. Provide food and water, a heavy blanket, and a large, shallow box (filled with litter) to serve as a litter box if its a cat, and continue to check animal listings in case you find the owner. Check in on the animal regularly, and if the animal is frightened or aggressive, call your local shelter who can take over on your behalf.
Consider adoption or a shelter
The animals now spent a few nights with you and youre wondering what to do next. For one, you cant stake claim to them just yet. Most states have holding laws. These allow the owner sufficient time to claim their pet if theyve gone astray. If that period expires, it then becomes your decision whether to keep them or not. 
Ask yourself if youre willing to commit the time and effort necessary, and whether the animal fits your lifestyle (if youre gone all day, is it the best decision for them?) And understand the costs involved, too, like vet fees, vaccinations, food, and a dog walker, if you choose to hire one.
If you cant make it work, thats fine. Find a local, no-kill shelter who can find them a good home (do an online search for reviews of shelters, too). 
No one goes into pet ownership expecting to have to give up their animal companion, but sometimes,

You can list the pet on websites like Petfinder, but be sure to properly vet prospective owners. Ask for references, if they have another pet, their experience with animals, their living situation, and how long the pet would be crated if necessary. Also, have them commit to a home check (where you can check in on the pets future living conditions). Itll take a lot of extra time, and yes, it wont be easy saying goodbye to Rover or Finneas, but its for their well-being, not just yours.

ALEX VADUKUL,"Mr. Perlman, who is alive, said through a representative: “I don’t remember Mr. Lipshutz and I also don’t recall my jury grades from 50 years ago. I want to wish him well.” By 1964, a promising future seemingly awaited Mr. Chandler at a world-class orchestra. He was 16, newspapers had chronicled his talents and he accepted an invitation that awaited only Mr. Galamian’s most gifted students: to study with him at the renowned Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. But within months, Mr. Chandler would be living with his parents in New Jersey, seeing a psychologist and vowing never to touch the violin again. Mr. Chandler still dislikes discussing how he abandoned the violin, and the degree to which he opens up about it depends on his mood. “That’s when I found out what I was,” he said one night on his boat. “It was a nervous breakdown. I unraveled.” His most direct explanation of the crisis is that he felt robbed of time. “I didn’t see myself,” he said. “Childhood was lost. Time was lost. Then one day I finally saw myself and I thought: ‘That’s it. There has to be more.’ But I lost everything realizing that.” “So many of us had talent, then we just disappeared,” he continued. “They never see who they are. They don’t know what they are. It’s the same reason child actors never grow up. We never see ourselves.” Ms. Hulbert, the author of “Off the Charts,” called Mr. Chandler’s turning point a “kind of midlife crisis.” “A gift that once nurtured them suddenly becomes a big struggle,” she said. “Their crisis comes down to autonomy: What am I?” Mr. Sortomme, his former Juilliard classmate, was not entirely surprised to hear of the turmoil. “I remember feeling there was not a lot of joy in Saul’s life,” he said. But he dismissed notions of Mr. Chandler as some fallen child wonder. “Saul is better off having stopped playing the violin to save his life instead of just keep going to give the world one more great violinist,” he said. Photo A shot of a boat Mr. Chandler sailed from the Caribbean to Connecticut in the 1970s. “The only thing that has ever truly been constant for me in my life is boats,” he said. Credit Ben Zucker for The New York Times When Mr. Chandler was recuperating back at home, Ms. Pardee and Mr. Galamian pleaded with his parents: What can we do? What can we tell the school? Does Saul want to play something else? Mr. Chandler passed along his reply: “Tell them I never want to be on a stage again.” He put away his instrument and commenced his reinvention. First he became a truck driver, and then he went to New Orleans. “I lost my virginity there,” he said. “I think.” He changed his name in 1969 from Lipshutz to Chandler. “I had to disappear,” he said. “I had to begin my metamorphosis.” He got a job around this time running a dodgy hotel in Times Square. “I knew all the hookers, and they knew me,” he said. He also started studying mathematics at New York University, where he found he was gifted with numbers. He would become a successful actuary, calculating risk for organizations like the American Cancer Society. As he chased lost time, his passion for the sea was growing. His father had read him books about sailing as a child, and on days off from violin practice they built boats together. Actuarial mathematics didn’t necessarily thrill him, but the work let him finance his hobby, and he was sailing and building boats seriously by his 30s. “It was my therapy,” he said. He got married in 1983, moved to Washington Heights and had two children. He started keeping boats on City Island in the mid-1980s, and he said he has since crossed the Atlantic and sailed from the Bronx to Trinidad a dozen times. After retiring in 2002, he began commuting from his apartment to City Island practically daily. “The only thing that has ever truly been constant for me in my life is boats,” he said. “When I build a boat, at least I can make it better. I can fix it.” I visited Mr. Chandler one winter night on his schooner, which is named Seraph and is dry-docked at Barron’s Marine. The boatyard was cold and ghostly. In his cabin, as the space heater rattled, he handed me a Budweiser. While he told me about recent repairs, I noticed a dusty CD case beside his radio. Classical discs were inside. I asked if we could put something on. “Put on the Puccini,” he said. The dramatic opening of the opera “ Tosca ” was soon booming through the boatyard from his little lamplit boat. “You fall in love with the voice when you get older,” he said. “Because you realize the human voice is all that matters.” I flipped through more CDs and noticed some violin recordings. Hesitantly, I asked to play one. “Do I have the Brahms sonatas?” he said. “You can put that on.” An elegant melody swelled from the speakers. He stood upright. “These are the most beautiful sonatas ever written,” he said. “He’s not playing the violin. The violin is playing him.” Mr. Chandler closed his eyes and drank more. Photo Mr. Chandler on the bowsprit of his schooner, Seraph. Credit Ben Zucker for The New York Times “Nobody wrote music,” he said. “They heard something. Except Mozart. He wrote the same thing over and over.” Bach was next. A dramatic crescendo played. “Stop,” he said. “This is amazing. Can you turn this up?” He swigged his beer. “Can you imagine being on this boat?” he said feverishly. “Out in the middle of the ocean? Millions of miles from anything? Listening to this?” A few weeks later, he agreed to show me his violin, and we met at his apartment in Washington Heights, where he lives with his wife, Sula. The library was filled with books about sailing and Herman Melville novels. The Chandlers raised their family in the neighborhood, and while music was around, his children grew up without having to practice an instrument for six hours a day. Mr. Chandler’s adult son, Fred, said his father’s musical past was never discussed when he was a boy. “Only thing I really remember is we had to play an instrument in grade school and I got the violin,” he said. “Right away, I got the sense he was uncomfortable with me playing it. He never tried to teach me. He went away while I was practicing. Except once in a blue moon, if he had been drinking, he might play a few minutes, and it was evident he was a real master.” Mr. Chandler went and fetched a bag of old newspaper clippings. “My mother kept these,” he said. Then he retrieved a dusty case. “I haven’t opened this in 50 years,” he said. “I’m scared to see what’s inside.” Mr. Chandler opened the case and a musky odor emerged. Inside was a dark red violin. Blue cursive ink on its interior indicated it was built by a Parisian luthier named Joseph Bassot in 1802. He dragged on a cigar as he considered the instrument in his hands. “Seeing this makes me think I made the right choice with my life,” he said. “I lived my life. Not the life of this violin.” Then he started putting it away. “I hate this thing,” he said. “I don’t want to see it anymore.” He opened a beer and seemed happy to talk about anything other than music. But the violin’s quiet presence would not be denied. Eventually, he put down his beer and approached the case. “Doubt I can even play this thing anymore,” he grumbled, slowly tuning the instrument. Then he placed it to his chin and released his bow. A warm, glorious tone rose through the apartment. Then he bowed again, violently sliding his hand up the violin’s neck, and a graceful, thunderous sound filled the room. Then the note faded away.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","This week a jury found that a mans use of Roundup on weeds in his yard was a substantial factor in causing the cancer that he developed years later. But court cases are not scientific studies, and scientists are still divided on whether glyphosate should really be considered a carcinogen. 
As weve covered before, the World Health Organizations International Agency for Research on Cancer studied the evidence and decided to add glyphosate to the list of things that probably cause cancer. Other things on that list include red meat, hot coffee, and the human papillomavirus.
But other organizations did their own analyses and came to different conclusions. The US Environmental Protection Agency, Health Canada, and the European Food Safety Authority all concluded that glyphosate is not likely to cause cancer. Individual studies on glyphosate have given mixed results for most cancers, with a handful of studies leaning toward the possibility that it really does cause non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
The most recent study found that among farm workers who worked with the most glyphosate, the risk of non-Hodgkins lymphoma was 2.8 percent, compared with just 2 percent in the population at large. (One of the authors of that study has a blog post explaining the work here.) Thats a small change in risk, and its probably doesnt apply to the average consumer who only encounters glyphosate in their backyard or as trace residues on food. But scientists do find it concerning that there was a detectable link at all. For an up-to-date summary of the scientific evidence on glyphosate, I recommend this explainer by Tom Philpott at Mother Jones.
Meanwhile, Bayer (which owns Roundup, having bought the company formerly known as Monsanto) put out a statement saying that there is plenty of evidence that glyphosate is safe and does not cause cancer. Which is, admittedly, true.
The truth is, court cases are not scientific studies. The jury in the recent lawsuit didnt have the time to wait for more results to roll in, nor the scientific expertise to answer a question that scientists have not yet agreed on. All the lawsuit really means is that it will be easier to bring future lawsuits. Glyphosate is still probably safe at the levels most of us are exposed to...but it will take more science to say for sure.","This week a jury found that a man’s use of Roundup on weeds in his yard was a “substantial factor” in causing the cancer that he developed years later.

Kirsten Korosec,"Tesla’s head of global finance is leaving the automaker, the latest high-level executive departure that comes just days after chief accounting officer Dave Morton resigned after barely a month on the job. The departure was first reported by Bloomberg. Tesla confirmed to TechCrunch that Justin McAnear, whose official title was vice president of worldwide finance and operation, is leaving after three years. His last day is October 7. “Several weeks ago, I announced to my team that I would be leaving Tesla because I had the chance to take a CFO role at another company,” McAnear said in a statement provided by Tesla. “I’ve truly loved my time at Tesla, and I have great respect for my colleagues and the work they do, but this was simply an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. Any other speculation as to why I’ve left is simply inaccurate. I’ve been working with the team to ensure a smooth transition prior to my last day on October 7th, and a number of members of the team are stepping up to fill my role.” A string of executives have left the company since the beginning of the year, including chief people officer Gaby Toledano, Sarah O’Brien, who headed up Tesla’s communications team, and the company’s senior vice president of engineering, Doug Field. Tesla has hired some executives in recent months, such as a global director of vehicle delivery and CFO for China operations, but gaps still remain. Some high-level positions haven’t been filled, while others have been restructured. CEO Elon Musk announced a series of promotions and job updates earlier this month that put more responsibility on a few key people. For instance, Kevin Kassekert previously headed up infrastructure development, a job that included leading the construction and development of Tesla’s gigafactory near Reno, Nevada. His new title is vice president of people and places, a position that gives him responsibility of human resources — a job that was once filled by Toledano — as well as facilities, construction and infrastructure. Tesla has more than 37,000 employees in facilities all over the world, including its factory in Fremont, California. Musk also promoted Jérôme Guillen to president of automotive. Guillen will oversee all automotive operations and program management, as well as coordinate Tesla’s supply chain. Guillen previously headed up Tesla’s truck program and worldwide sales and service.","Tesla’s head of global finance is leaving the automaker, the latest high-level executive departure that comes just days after chief accounting officer Dave Morton resigned after barely a month on the job.

Ben Fractenberg,"As a person who recently lost their job in a fairly (read: very) public way I’ve quickly had to adapt to a routine of unemployment. Granted, being laid off as a journalist is a little different than other sectors in that you can immediately start to pick up freelance work. But it’s still easy to fall into a malaise of being overwhelmed by negative emotion while simultaneously trying to create structure and figure out your next steps. During this murky time, Dr. Melanie Greenberg, who works as a psychologist and is the author of The Stress-Proof Brain, recommends keeping your focus on two main tasks: looking for a new job or career path, and attending to your emotional and psychological well-being. Below, strategies for fending off despair, keeping yourself out of debt, and finding a new gig as soon as possible. Look After Your Mental Health If you find yourself suddenly and unceremoniously laid off, says Greenberg, planning out your future job prospects is obviously a key step. “Figure out to how rebuild, which may involve looking for work and taking a step back and looking at the big picture of what you can do—sometimes you have to have a couple irons in the fire,” she tells us. That said, this is also a time to be particularly attentive to your mental health. “You need time for that and you need to deal with the emotional consequences so you don’t get depressed,” says Greenberg.“Find time for exercise and finding social groups, finding volunteer activities.” If you have mental health issues but can’t afford (or make time for) one-on-one therapy, there are… Read more Read Dr. Greenberg also recommended meditation, which can help focus your mind and make sure you are not consumed with trying to “deal with things out of your control.” (Rather than shelling out for classes at a time when your income is unsteady, you can start out with one of the numerous free or cheap meditation apps currently available.) Being unemployed can also be a good time to work on your personal relationships and reinforce your self-esteem. “What do you feel proud of in your own personal values? Try to think of personal qualities and find people who will validate those qualities,” Dr. Greenberg said. “Sometimes people isolate themselves. They don’t want to tell people about it. That can make you more depressed.” In my personal experience, for instance, I’ve found it helpful to go to as many social gatherings and networking events as possible, and have volunteered time to help a close friend open up a gallery space in Brooklyn. Dr. Greenberg added that while it’s important to stay engaged, you should also feel free to set boundaries about what you want to discuss about your personal life and can have set responses such as, “I’ve been exploring a few opportunities” when asked about your job search. It’s also important to keep in mind that this is a time of general anxiety for many people who still have full-time work. “Certain industries are getting a bit harder; the nature of work is changing. It’s globalization,” Dr. Greenberg said. You can help to manage some of these feelings through working on your willingness to tolerate anxiety when you are doing things like meeting new people at networking events or informational interviews. Part of this is simply being aware that you will always have some nervous feelings when doing things like speaking publicly, and then accepting that it’s normal, and having confidence that you can do a good job at something even if you have some butterflies in your stomach. Whether you're laid off or fired, losing a job sucks. It takes an emotional toll, and on top… Read more Read Create a Routine Long before you have a new job with new hours, it can be enormously helpful to create some structure to your days, which can help you strike the balance between mental health exercises, doing freelance work, and looking for new work. “I think it’s very important to make a schedule as if you’re working, [but] it doesn’t have to be nine to five,” Dr. Greenberg said. “It helps you feel a little more in control. It helps for depression to have things to focus on.” I’ve found it helpful to stick my previous life as much as possible. I try to get up with my wife at about 7 a.m. and then get chores done in the morning before setting up sections of time to do freelance work, look for new gigs and keep up with local news. I also dress the same as I did for my full-time job and work in our small office space to create as much of a professional-feeling atmosphere as possible. It may help to digitize your productivity with time-management apps such as focus booster, which helps you concentrate on specific tasks and build in time for bathroom or email breaks, or Google Calendar, which you can use to block out your day and set some times to get a break (“9am-12pm job searching,” “12pm to 1pm lunch,” “1pm to 3pm freelance work,” “4pm to 5pm gym,” etc.). Another option: I have a successful writer friend who said she uses the website e.ggtimer.com to set countdown clocks so she can stay focused on specific work. (This is a variation on the classic Pomodoro technique, which many people swear by.) You could, say, set a 30-minute timer for updating your website, making sure you don’t get distracted while you’re listing and linking to your recent accomplishments. If you have any control over the date or time of your job interview, you might want to consider… Read more Read Set Small, Concrete Goals Within your newly established routine, it’s helpful to have achievable daily and weekly goals. It can obviously feel overwhelming to have a big-picture plan to find a new job or change careers, but breaking that down into steps, like working on your resume, or networking with at least five people on LinkedIn can help. So your day could be broken into several blocks of time like reaching out to contacts, researching open positions and taking time to stay healthy by doing yoga at home. Each of those activities could become an action item checked off your daily to-do list. From there, your weekly goal could be turn your outreach into at least a few scheduled coffee meetings, and to apply to at least three new jobs. And it’s good, too, to set rewards for completing a task. If you’ve spent a few hours contacting potential employers or contacts, then maybe watch an episode of your favorite show on Netflix before moving on to your next goal. That said, while goals can be crucial, it’s also important to leave your days flexible enough to make room for something like a job interview, says Dallas-based financial planner Katie Brewer, CFP. “If you’re looking for jobs you don’t have as much control [about when an interviewer may want to meet],” Brewer added. She said it could be good to put more emphasis on your weekly goals, like applying to five new jobs, in case you need to rearrange your schedule one day to have a meeting. There’s no sense in ignoring a potential opportunity because you’ve set a too-rigid schedule for yourself. If you're starting to get an unnerving feeling that your job is on the line, you can do a lot… Read more Read Reevaluate Your Finances The three big financial tasks you need to do after losing a job, according to Brewer, are to quickly evaluate your health benefit options, adjust your budget and try not to tap into your retirement account. There’s the understandable immediate reaction of “freaking out and laying in bed,” Brewer said, but that can keep you from making decisions on things you may need to do within the first 30 days of unemployment, such as signing up for COBRA health benefits. This period of uncertainty is also a “good time for somebody to list out what their wants versus their needs are,” Brewer tells us. “You have to put [expenses] in one of those two categories.” If there is something you feel falls in between, like going to the gym to stay in shape and reduce stress, then maybe think about switching to a cheaper community center or simply just going for a jog around your neighborhood in the morning. Most of us wouldn’t think to associate the words ""joblessness"" and ""fun,"" but… Read more Read The last thing is to avoid cashing out your 401(k). “Put that as the very very very last thing you do,” Brewer says. “If you can leave it intact you avoid a penalty and taxes. [Leaving it alone] is really easy to do and really hard to undo.” Ultimately, all of these pieces fit together; managing our anxiety and setting manageable goals can help us avoid making rash decisions like cashing out our retirement, and being on top of things in those areas sets us up well to work towards a new job or career. And more generally, actively better planning your schedule and working in time to attend to your mental health can help you cope and thrive in the new gig economy. “It’s kind of difficult times [economically]. We are facing new challenges,” says Greenberg. “Trying to learn how to adapt is the most important thing.”",As a person who recently lost their job in a fairly (read: very) public way I’ve quickly had to adapt to a routine of unemployment.

"Paul P. Murphy, CNN","(CNN) Idaho State University has been fined after it lost track of a small amount of plutonium 239, a substance used to make nuclear weapons. University Officials say the sample, missing since 2003, does not pose a direct health issue or risk to public safety. The substance had been used by the school to conduct several research experiments. The school realized it had lost track of the plutonium earlier this year and immediately notified the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ISU officials said the sample, weighing a gram, was lost as it was being taken out of service after employees only partially filled out the necessary paperwork. Although the ISU believes the tiny speck of plutonium was transferred to a licensed disposal facility, there are no records to prove that it was. The commission fined the university $8,500 for the lost plutonium. The University has since updated its protocols saying, ""Enhancements to ISU's inventory system and other administrative initiatives were immediately put into place to prevent this type of discrepancy in the future."" NRC spokesperson Victor Dricks was quoted by Newsweek magazine as saying the lost material was enough to make a so-called ""dirty bomb."" Dricks would not confirm or dispute that comment when contacted by CNN. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","Idaho State University has been fined after it lost track of a small amount of plutonium 239, a substance used to make nuclear weapons.",2018-05-07T19:23:07Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",University fined for lost plutonium,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/07/us/university-lost-plutonium-trnd/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/111216083147-radioactive-symbol-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,lost,1
Kirsten Korosec,"Amazon Prime Day is over, and what a ride it was this year. Widespread technical glitches in the first hours of Amazon’s massive annual Prime Day promotion cost the e-commerce giant an estimated $1.2 million a minute, according to One Click Retail founder Spencer Millerberg. The total loss is difficult to nail down, in part because the exact span of the outage varied. But the data analytics firm says the outage, which included a broken landing page and links that sent potential customers to an error page, appeared to be concentrated on the East and West coasts of the U.S. for about 75 minutes. That puts Amazon’s loss in sales at about $90 million, an estimate One Click Retail based on 1P sales from 2017. Another estimate from discount site Lovethesales.com put Amazon’s loss at more than $99 million, Bloomberg reported. And yet, Amazon contends that these massive glitches didn’t dampen the day. Amazon doesn’t disclose Prime Day sales figures. But the company issued statements Tuesday and Wednesday with glowing Prime Day sales stats. Here’s one nugget: Prime Day sales in the U.S. grew faster than last year within the first 10 hours of the annual sales promotion. Amazon said Wednesday that sales this Prime Day surpassed Cyber Monday, Black Friday and the previous Prime Day, when comparing 36-hour periods. Prime members globally purchased more than 100 million products during this year’s Prime Day event. Small and medium-sized businesses made out, as well, with sales exceeding $1 billion this Prime Day, according to Amazon. Insights from algorithmic commerce startup Feedvisor fill in a few of the gaps. Feedvisor estimated spending skyrocketed 89 percent in the first 12 hours of the event compared with the same period last year, Bloomberg reported. There are a few explanations behind the jump in sales. The company extended Prime Day from 30 to 36 hours this year. And it added four more countries, including Australia. But there may be other reasons for the increase in sales, including, in a weird twist, the outage itself. One Click Retail contends that the extra media coverage of the outage appears to have helped Amazon. The company also found that deal volume doubled in Italy, Japan, Mexico and Spain and that 84 percent of brands extended their discount to more than one item, compared to just 67 percent last year.","Amazon Prime Day is over and what a ride it was this year.

Natasha Lomas,"Mark Zuckerberg’s friend count continues to tick down in the face of a major data misuse scandal griping the company. The latest individual to #DeleteFacebook is no less than the privacy commissioner of New Zealand. Writing in The Spinoff, John Edwards accuses Facebook of being non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act — and urges other New Zealanders to follow his lead and ditch the social network. He says he’s acting after a complaint that Facebook failed to provide a user in New Zealand with information it held on them. “Every New Zealander has the right to find out what information an agency holds about them. It is a right of constitutional significance,” he writes. “Facebook failed to meet its obligations under the Privacy Act, and when given a statutory demand from my office to produce the information at issue so that I could discharge my statutory duty to the requester to review it, Facebook initially refused to provide it, and then asserted that Facebook was not subject to the New Zealand Privacy Act, and was therefore under no obligation to provide it. “Our investigation was not able to proceed, and we notified the parties that while we were able to conclude that Facebook’s actions constituted an interference with privacy, and a failure to comply with its obligations both to the requester, and to my Office, there was nothing further we could do.” Facebook’s strategy of arguing it is not under the jurisdiction of privacy laws in international markets is a standard play for the company which instructs its lawyers to argue it is only subject to Irish data protection law, given its international HQ is based in Ireland. (NB: The geographical distance between Ireland and New Zealand is roughly 18,600km — a vast physical span that of course presents no barrier to Facebook’s digital business making money by mining personal data in New Zealand.) The company’s ‘your local privacy rules don’t apply to our international business’ strategy appears to be on borrowed time, in Europe at least — with some European courts already feeling able to deny Facebook’s claim that Ireland be its one-stop shop for any/all international legal challenges. The EU also has a major update to its data protection framework incoming, the GDPR, which will apply from May 25 — and which ramps up the liabilities for companies ignoring data protection rules by bringing in a new penalty regime that scales as high as 4% of a organizations global turnover (for Facebook that could mean fines as large as $1.6BN, based on the ~$40.6BN it earned last year — per its 2017 full year results ). And that’s all before you consider the huge public and political pressure now being brought to bear on the company over data handling and user privacy, as a result of the current data misuse scandal. Which has also wiped off billions in share value. “We applied our naming policy and today have identified Facebook as non-compliant with the New Zealand Privacy Act in order to inform consumers of the non-compliance, the associated risks, and their options for protecting their data,” adds Edwards, joining the anti-Facebook pile-on. “Under current law there is little more I am able to do to practically to protect my, or New Zealanders’ data on Facebook. I will continue to assert that Facebook is obliged to comply with New Zealand law in relation to personal information it holds and uses in relation to its New Zealand users, and in due course a case may come before the courts, either through my Office, or at the suit of the company.” He goes on to suggest that the 2.5 million New Zealanders who use Facebook could consider modifying their settings and postings on the platform in light of its current non-compliant terms and conditions — or even delete their account altogether, linking to a page on the commission’s own website which explains how to delete a Facebook account. So, er, ouch. In response to the commissioner’s actions, Facebook has decided to try to brand the country’s privacy commissioner as, er, hostile to privacy… A Facebook spokesperson emailed us the following statement: We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year’s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticised us for protecting their privacy. We scrutinize all requests to disclose personal data, particularly the contents of private messages, and will challenge those that are overly broad. We have investigated the complaint from the person who contacted the Commissioner’s office but we haven’t been provided enough detail to fully resolve it. Instead, the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data. We have a long history of working with the Commissioner, and we will continue to request information that will help us investigate this complaint further. This of course is pure spin — and a very clunky attempt by Facebook to shift attention off the nub of the issue: Its own non-compliance with privacy laws outside its preferred legal jurisdictions. Frankly it’s a very risky PR strategy at a time when it really has become impossible for Facebook to deny quite how comfortable the company was, up until mid 2015, to hand over reams of personal information on Facebookers to third party users of its developer platform — without requiring these external entities gain individual level consent (friends could ‘consent’ for all their friends!). Hence the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The non-compliance of Facebook with European data protection laws was in the spotlight yesterday, during an oral hearing in front of the UK parliamentary committee that’s looking into the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data misuse scandal — as part of a wider enquiry into online disinformation and political campaigning. Giving testimony to the committee as an expert witness Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of PersonalData.IO — a startup service designed to help people control how their personal information is accessed by companies — recounted how he had spent “years” trying to obtain his personal information from Facebook. Downloaded FB data also gives you insight into whom else has data on you (used to run custom audiences). Have never engaged with 75% of these… pic.twitter.com/dQPjIcI8CW — Christian Hernandez (@christianhern) March 26, 2018 Dehaye said his persistence in pressing the company eventually led it to build a tool that lets Facebook users obtain a subset list of advertisers who hold their contact information — though only for a rolling eight week period. “I personally had 200 advertisers that had declared to Facebook that they had my consent to advertise. One of them is Booz Allen Hamilton, which is an information company,” Dehaye told the committee. “I don’t know how [BAH got my data]. I don’t know why they think they have my consent on this. Where that information comes from. I would be curious to ask.” Asked whether he was surprised by the data Facebook held on him and also by the company’s reluctance to share this personal information, Dehaye said he had been surprised they “implemented something” — i.e. the tool that gives an eight week snapshot. But he also argued this glimpse is illustrative because it underlines just how much Facebook still isn’t telling users. “They implicitly acknowledge that yes they should disclose that information,” said Dehaye, adding: “You have to think that these databases are probably trawled through by a tonne of intelligence services to now figure out what happened in all those different circumstances. And also by Facebook itself to assess what happened.” “Facebook is invoking an exception in Irish law in the data protection law — involving, ‘disproportionate effort’. So they’re saying it’s too much of an effort to give me access to this data. I find that quite intriguing because they’re making essentially a technical and a business argument for why I shouldn’t be given access to this data — and in the technical argument they’re in a way shooting themselves in the foot. Because what they’re saying is they’re so big that there’s no way they could provide me with this information. The cost would be too large. “It’s not just about their user base being so large — if you parse their argument, it’s about the number of communications that are exchanged. And usually that’s taken of a measure of dominance of a communication medium. So they are really arguing ‘we are too big to comply with data protection law’. The costs would be too high for us. Which is mindboggling that they wouldn’t see the direction they’re going there. Do they really want to make that argument?” “They don’t price the cost itself,” he added. “They don’t say it would cost us this much [to comply with the data request]. If they were starting to put a cost on getting your data out of Facebook — you know, every tiny point of data — that would be very interesting to have to compare with smaller companies, smaller social networks. If you think about how antitrust laws work, that’s the starting point for those laws. So it’s kind of mindboggling that they don’t see their argumentation, how it’s going to hurt them at some point.”","Mark Zuckerberg’s friend count continues to tick down in the face of a major data misuse scandal griping the company.

Darrell Etherington,"SpaceX’s latest rocket may have launched successfully – but the mission didn’t end as a win. The Zuma payload it was carrying, a mysterious classified piece of cargo for the U.S. government believed to be a spy satellite, was lost after it failed to separate from the second stage of the rocket after the first stage of the Falcon 9 separated as planned and returned to Earth. The WSJ reports, and we’ve confirmed separately, that the payload is thought to have fallen back through the Earth’s atmosphere after reaching space, because of the failure to separate. The failure is one that can happen when cargo doesn’t properly detach as planned, since the second stage is designed to fall back to Earth and burn up in re-entry. SpaceX had launched as planned on January 7 in its target window, and recovered the first stage of the booster with a landing at its Cape Canaveral facility. Because of the nature of the mission, coverage and information regarding the progress of the rocket and its payload from then on was not disclosed. The payload, codenamed Zuma, was contracted for launch by Northrop Grumman by the U.S. government, and Northrop selected SpaceX as the launch provider. SpaceX had previously launched the U.S. Air Force’s X-37B spacecraft, and was approved for flying U.S. government payloads with national security missions. The satellite was likely worth billions, according to the WSJ, which makes this the second billion-dollar plus payload that SpaceX has lost in just over two years; the last was Facebook’s internet satellite, which was destroyed when the Falcon 9 it was supposed to launch on exploded during preflight preparations in September 2016. This could be a significant setback for SpaceX, since these kinds of contracts can be especially lucrative, and it faces fierce competition from existing launch provider ULA, jointly operated by Boeing and Lockheed Martin. We’ve reached out to SpaceX and will update if they provide additional comment.","SpaceX’s latest rocket may have launched successfully – but the mission didn’t end as a win.

 Gerald Cotten
When the 30-year-old founder of a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange died suddenly, he took the whereabouts of some C$180m ($135m; £105m) in cryptocurrency to his grave. Now, tens of thousands of Quadriga CX users are wondering if they will ever see their funds again. 
In 2014, one of the world's biggest online cryptocurrency exchanges - MtGox - unexpectedly shut down after losing 850,000 Bitcoins valued at the time at nearly $0.4bn (£0.3bn).
Its meltdown shook investors in the volatile emerging marketplace - but the calamity at the Tokyo-based company proved a boon for a new Canadian online cryptocurrency exchange. 
""People like the fact we're located in Canada and know where their money is going,"" Quadriga CX founder Gerald Cotten said at the time. 
Some five years later, Cotten's sudden, untimely death has left thousands of his customers scrambling for information about their own missing funds. 
""We don't know whether or not we're going to get our money back,"" Tong Zou, who says he is owed C$560,000 - his life savings - told the BBC. 
""There's just a lot of uncertainty."" 
This month, Quadriga - which had grown to become Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchange - was granted temporary bankruptcy protection in a Canadian court. 
The firm said it had spent the weeks since Cotten's death trying desperately to ""locate and secure our very significant cryptocurrency reserves"".

 Broken representations of the Bitcoin virtual currency
In court documents, Quadriga says it owes up to 115,000 users an estimated C$250m - about C$70m in hard currency and between C$180m an C$190m in cryptocurrency, based on recent market rates. 
It believes - though it's not certain - that the bulk of those millions in reserves was locked away by Cotten in cold storage, which is an offline safeguard against hacking and theft.
For now, all trading has been suspended on the platform. 
Bernie Doyle, CEO of Refine Labs and head of the Toronto chapter of the Government Blockchain Association, calls what's happening at Quadriga a ""seismic event"" in the industry. 
The world of digital currency has little regulatory oversight and a history of volatile prices, hacking threats, and minimal consumer protection. 
Mr Doyle says this only adds to the nascent sector's already ""checkered history"". 
But he says ""it's really unfortunate that the ecosystem takes a hit"" amid one firm's problems. 
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 The theft involved the lesser-known IOTA cryptocurrency
What happened at Quadriga? 
Court documents filed in late January offer some insight into the company. 
Quadriga had no offices, no employees and no bank accounts. It was essentially a one-man band run entirely by Cotten wherever he - and his laptop - happened to be, which was usually his home in Fall River, Nova Scotia. 
It used some third-party contractors to handle some of the additional work, including payment processing. 
His widow, Jennifer Robertson, says she was not involved in the company until her husband died suddenly on 9 December in India from complications related to Crohn's disease. 
In an affidavit, she says she has searched the couple's home and other properties for business records related to Quadriga, to no avail. The laptop on which he conducted all the business is encrypted and she doesn't have the password or recovery key. 
An investigator hired to assist in recovering any records had little success. 
It was also recently revealed the company somehow inadvertently transferred Bitcoins valued at almost half-a-million dollars into cold storage in early February and now can't access them. 
But Quadriga's troubles didn't start with missing coins. The company's liquidity problems began months earlier. 
In January 2018, Canadian bank CIBC froze five accounts containing about C$26m linked to Quadriga's payment processor in a dispute over the real owners of the funds, an issue that ended up in court. 
Image copyrightSupreme Court of Nova Scotia Image caption
 A photo of bank drafts submitted in Quadriga court documents
The company says it also has millions in bank drafts it has been unable to deposit because banks have been unwilling to accept them. 
Ms Robertson's affidavit to the court included photos showing stacks of bank drafts placed on a kitchen stove. 
Those banking disputes contributed to a ""severe liquidity crunch"" at the company, with frustrated users facing delays and difficulties trying to access funds.
Who was Gerald Cotten? 
In photos and interviews, Cotten comes across as a clean-cut business school graduate who tended to favour the casual shirts and jeans uniform of a tech entrepreneur. 
In a statement, Quadriga called him a ""visionary leader"" who was in India for the opening an orphanage for children in need when he died. 
His friend Alex Salkeld described Cotten as a helpful, easy-going young man keen to contribute to the community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts. 
""I don't think you'll find anyone willing to say anything bad about him,"" he told the BBC. 
Mr Salkeld said once a week Vancouver Bitcoin Co-Op members would all head over to the Quadriga's then-offices ""and just talk Bitcoin"". 
Like others at the time, he said Cotten saw Bitcoin as a technology with the potential to change the world - a virtual currency free of governments and the banking system. 
Mr Salkeld said that since Cotten died, those who knew him have been going back-and-forth over how he could possibly have failed to have a contingency plan in place.

But amid rampant talk online about possible fraud related to the missing coins, Mr Salkeld said that, to him, ""it's looking like a tragic series of unfortunate events strung together in a really unlucky way"". 
Cotten's last will and testament also gives some hints as to his life and assets. 
The document, signed shortly before his ill-fated trip to India, shows he appointed Ms Robertson as executor of the estate and left her the bulk of his property. 
It offers some detail into those assets: a Lexus, an airplane - he was an amateur pilot - a sailboat, and real estate in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and British Columbia. 
He even planned for the care of his two chihuahuas, Nitro and Gully. 
The case against Quadriga
There are many who are suspicious of Quadriga's story and who doubt claims that Cotten had the only key to reserves valued in the tens of millions of dollars. 
Online sleuths and industry experts have analysed the public transaction history of Quadriga wallets - which are used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency - and have raised the possibility that the cold storage reserves might not exist at all. 
That has led to concern there is more at play than poor business practices and internal company chaos in the wake of Cotten's death. 
Others have wondered whether Cotten faked his own death and that this is all part of an ""exit scam"" to abscond with the funds. 
Amid those rumours, Ms Robertson's affidavit included a copy of statement of death from a funeral home in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
The hospital in Jaipur where Cotten was treated also released a statement detailing the medical interventions he received prior to his death. 
His widow says she has received death threats and ""slanderous comments"" online since Quadriga publicly announced its troubles. 
An independent third party monitor has also been appointed to oversee the court proceedings, and is currently in possession of Cotten's laptop and other devices. 
What happens next? 
In an online message to its users, Quadriga said it filed for creditor protection to give it time to ensure the future viability of the company. 
It also admitted it is in ""the early stages of a long process and [does] not have all the answers right now"". 
According to court filings, Quadriga is also investigating whether some of the cryptocurrency could be secured on other exchanges and it said it's considering selling the platform to cover its debts.
A number of affected users, including Tong Zou, have retained lawyers and are seeking representation in the proceedings. 
Meanwhile, Canada's main securities regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission, has confirmed it looking into Quadriga ""given the potential harm to Ontario investors"".",When Quadriga's founder died he left behind a mystery: what happened to millions in cryptocurrency?,2019-02-17T00:41:33Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Quadriga: The cryptocurrency exchange that lost $135m,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47203706,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7AF8/production/_105608413_gerald.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,lost,1

Mark Kaufman,"There's something truly out of place amid a slew of uneventful news releases on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website: Six bizarre sentences, accusing the Obama Administration of distorting climate science. Posted to the federal agency's site on Wednesday, the brief missive contends that Obama's scientists improperly influenced the new congressionally-mandated National Climate Assessment by focusing on the ""worst-case scenario"" for climate change this century. The release, which cited as its corroborating evidence an article from the conservative website The Daily Caller, promotes a profoundly misleading, oversimplified, and politicized view of the climate report, which involved the work of 13 government agencies and 300 climate scientists. The decision to publish this as an official release from the chief office of a government agency responsible for the nation's environmental oversight is rash, and problematic, at best. ""For the EPAs political leadership to do this is, one might say, deplorable,"" Joe Goffman, a former EPA senior counsel in the Office of Air and Radiation, said in an interview. ""Theyve done something really flagrant as part of the campaign to foster misinformation to the public about climate science,"" Goffman, now the executive director of Harvard Law Schools Environmental Law Program, added. ""I would argue they committed a genuinely cardinal sin with respect to the values of scientific integrity and the trustworthiness they owe the public."" Just how flagrantly misinformed is the EPA's release? The current incarnation of the EPA is claiming that President Barack Obama's science advisor and current Harvard professor, John Holdren, used a routine May 2015 memo to instruct the report's scientists to focus on the ""worst case"" climate scenario, meaning the continued release of high amounts of greenhouse gases over the coming decades. The Climate Assessment, however, considered a variety of scenarios about the future climate based upon different carbon emission possibilities just as it has in the past. The highest, or ""worst-case,"" is if trends continue as they are, allowing for historically unprecedented amounts of heat-trapping greenhouse gases to accumulate in the atmosphere. This scenario is formally called ""RCP 8.5."" The other major scenarios, contingent upon a lowering of greenhouse gas emissions, are RCP 6.0, 4.5 and 2.6 (with 2.6 being the lowest). In the last two national climate assessments (2014 and 2018), scientists chose RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios as the main, or most likely, based upon the amount of greenhouse gas emissions being expelled into the air but it certainly did not ignore the lowest possibility (RCP 2.6). In fact, 4.5 is a low-end scenario, too. ""Wow, this EPA press release really is the express train to crazy town,"" Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&amp;M University, said over email. ""What The Daily Caller and EPA clearly want readers to think is that Holdren told the assessment team to look ONLY at the worst case scenario. That's obviously false."" ""This EPA press release really is the express train to crazy town"" What's more, the lowest of the low emissions scenario, RCP 2.6, is growing increasingly unlikely. Meeting that would require net-zero greenhouse gas emissions globally in the second half of this century, Bob Kopp, Director of the Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Rutgers University, explained over email. That's ""more ambitious than current policy, and in the opposite direction from that which current federal policy is taking us,"" Kopp said. The main climate scenarios. Image: bob Kopp/Economic Risks of Climate Change: An American Prospectus As it is, ""RCP 4.5 requires substantial mitigation policy to achieve,"" noted Kopp. And, critically, we are now on a track for the higher-end, worst-case scenario whether EPA leadership wishes to accept the data or not. ""Historical CO2 emissions have been closer to RCP 8.5 than to any other scenario,"" said Kopp. SEE ALSO: This scientist keeps winning money from people who bet against climate change Where we're ultimately headed may be the worst-case scenario, or fall somewhere in between RCP 8.5 and 4.5. That's why the climate assessment considered a range of possibilities which is what Holdren recommended. There's simply no deception, nor ploy here. ""This is a standard and common-sense approach because we don't know what path emissions will follow, you try to estimate what's the best case and worst-case and assume that reality will fall somewhere in between them,"" said Dessler. ""That's what the memo says to do and that's what the assessment did and that seems completely reasonable to me."" This makes the EPA's news release all the more bizarre. It appears as if it's coming from a whimsical social media post, or a pundit with an animosity towards Obama, or Obama's environmental policy. ""This is an official statement of the U.S. EPA,"" noted Goffman. ""Here you have the government doing something that's affirmatively misleading."" You can't just pick from science what suits you, and to the rest you just say ""I don't believe it""! Well you can, but then you're unsuitable for any position of responsibility. pic.twitter.com/PHkBPd06v7 Stefan Rahmstorf (@rahmstorf) November 29, 2018 For nearly two years now, the EPA has made efforts to both hide information about and mislead the public about the truth behind climate science. The agency has completely eliminated its climate change webpages, and in March sent its staff ""talking points"" on how to speak about climate research encouraging scientists to emphasize any uncertainties in the science. The latest U.S. Climate Assessment lays out how every portion of the U.S. will be impacted by climate change under the likely emissions scenarios. ""The impacts of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country,"" the report reads. ""More frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events, as well as changes in average climate conditions, are expected to continue to damage infrastructure, ecosystems, and social systems that provide essential benefits to communities."" The EPA's chief, former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, has publicly questioned the report, though he hasn't finished reviewing it. President Donald Trump simply dismisses both the report and climate science that is agreed upon by scientists globally. The EPA's release which includes a picture of Obama and Holdren is blatantly an attempt to promote the Trump Administration's denial of accumulating climate science... but a sloppy one. ""I think the transparently misleading nature of this [EPA] argument underscores how few legitimate arguments the Administration has against this powerful report,"" said Dessler.","There's something truly out of place amid a slew of uneventful news releases on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website: Six bizarre sentences, accusing the Obama Administration of distorting climate science.

Michael Hardy,"After years of playing with fire, Kevin Cooley finally got burned. Inspired by the smoke signals used at the Vatican to signal the election of a new pope, the multimedia artist began setting controlled fires in and around his studio and photographing their multicolored plumes of smoke. In a way, it was the logical next step for an artist whose previous projects have examined earth, water, and wind, the other three classical elements.
But in 2017, Cooleys personal and professional lives unexpectedly intersected when the La Tuna fire nearly destroyed his Los Angeles home, which sits on a two-acre lot in the Tujunga neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley, between the Verdugo and San Gabriel Mountains. The fire broke out on September 1, and quickly began racing through the hills of the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank.
Cooley happened to be helping his son assemble an emergency preparedness kit for a school assignment when he first noticed smoke rising from behind a nearby hill. ""It was hard to tell how far away it was, because there was just this giant smoke column,"" he recalls. He and his family had just moved into the house after a six-month renovation; now they had to pack their most valuable belongings in a car in case they needed to evacuate. (At the top of Cooley's list: hard drives containing his digital photographs, and some old negatives.)
The night passed uneventfully, Cooley and his wife sleeping in shifts, but in the morning the fire crested a nearby hill, with only an empty expanse of dry chaparral between it and them. After helping his family evacuate, Cooley returned with his camera to document the possible immolation of his home. ""The only way I could process the fire was to photograph it,"" he says. ""I took a lot of the photographs from my driveway, essentially.""
The hard work of local firefighters saved the house, and Cooley continued photographing the aftermath of the fire, which eventually consumed over 7,000 acres, becoming one of the largest in Los Angeles history. Over the following weeks, Cooley was amazed to see the charred landscape showing early signs of recovery. ""The chaparral ecosystem only regenerates through fire,"" he says. ""It was amazing how fast it came back.""
After the close call with destruction, Cooley briefly considered leaving LA. ""But where do you go that's safe from natural disasters?"" he says. ""New York has flooding from hurricanes, the Midwest has tornadoes, anywhere in California has earthquakes. I really don't know where safe is."" Besides, he points out, unloading his house might prove a challenge for the immediate future.
""There's a charred landscape right behind methat's not exactly a great selling point.""

Jon Fingas,"The drones are more efficient in how they search, too. Rather than simply telling the drones to cover the nearest unexplored area, MIT's method preserves as much of the drone's momentum as possible. This typically results in a spiral pattern that covers an area much faster -- important in a rescue mission when every minute counts. There are limitations. The current system still needs an external ground station to merge maps, and it would need an object recognition system to identify people. MIT envisions future versions sharing maps when they come in contact, though, and object recognition is entirely realistic. If everything falls into place, the appeal will be obvious.

Mike Epstein,"The internet, as a place, is constantly growing. We build more and more webpages every dayso many, in fact, that it can feel as if certain corners of it are lost to time.
As it turns out, they may only be lost to Google. Earlier this year, web developer-bloggers Tim Bray and Marco Fioretti noted that Google seems to have stopped indexing the entirety of the internet for Google Search. As a result, certain old websitesthose more than 10 years olddid not show up through Google search. Both writers lamented that limiting Googles effective memory to the last decade, while logical when faced with the daunting task of playing information concierge to our every whimsical question, forces us to reckon with the fact that, when you use Google for historical searches, there are probably more answers out there.
As a BoingBoing post based on Brays points out, DuckDuckGo and Bing both still seem to offer more complete records of the internet, specifically showing web pages that Google stopped indexing for search. If youre looking for a specific website from before 2009 and cant find it, either one is a solid first step. If that doesnt work, its always possible someone else who needed the same page you were looking for saved it as an archive on the Wayback Machine.
But what about broad questions? Questions where you dont already know the answer? Historical research from the early web? There are other, more specialized options for that. A Hacker News forum post suggests a couple of search engines. Million Short, which allows you to run a search and automatically skip the most popular answers to probe deeper into the web. Wiby.me is a search engine for classic websites, made to help people find hobbyist pages and other archaic features of the internet.
The Hacker news thread also brings up Pinboard, a minimalist bookmarking service similar to Pocket, which has a key feature for archivists: If you sign up for its premium service$11 per yearPinboard will make a web archive of every page you save. If youre looking at older, unindexed material, such a tool can make it easier to go back to specific parts of the older internet that you may want or need to recall again.","The internet, as a “place,” is constantly growing.

However, this week a friend of mine made a suggestion I was surprised I hadn’t thought of before: splitting your checked items across two suitcases with a friend.

If there’s one thing that’s more frustrating than ridiculously long security lines at the airport,… Read more Read Personally, I try to avoid checking a bag whenever possible, but sometimes doing so is pretty unavoidable. When you’re traveling for a week or more, especially to a colder climate that calls for bulkier clothes, then you probably need to go for that larger bag. If you’re traveling with a partner or friend, rather than carrying your own individual suitcases, split the load between each of you. For instance, when my boyfriend and I travel to France later this year I might put half my outfits in his bag and half of his in mine. If he’s traveling with two warm sweaters, I’ll take one and he can take the other. It goes without saying, but does this swap together so you know what’s inside your bag if an airport employee asks. Yes, both of our bags could wind up lost since we’re on the same itinerary, but this sort of hedges your bets a bit so you have a better chance of making it to your destination with half your stuff rather than nothing. And obviously, even when you split stuff makes sure you’re carrying on essentials like your house keys and important documents and medications. While your checked luggage will probably make it (in the over 100+ flights I’ve checked a bag they’ve only lost mine once), you’re still better safe than sorry.","I travel a good bit, so I’ve started to reach a point where not too many travel “hacks” surprise me.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright BBC Marathi The discovery of rock carvings believed to be tens of thousands of years old in India's western state of Maharashtra has greatly excited archaeologists who believe they hold clues to a previously unknown civilisation, BBC Marathi's Mayuresh Konnur reports. The rock carvings - known as petroglyphs - have been discovered in their thousands atop hillocks in the Konkan region of western Maharashtra. Mostly discovered in the Ratnagiri and Rajapur areas, a majority of the images etched on the rocky, flat hilltops remained unnoticed for thousands of years. Image copyright BBC Marathi Most of them were hidden beneath layers of soil and mud. But a few were in the open - these were considered holy and worshipped by locals in some areas. The sheer variety of the rock carvings have stunned experts - animals, birds, human figures and geometrical designs are all depicted. The way the petroglyphs have been drawn, and their similarity to those found in other parts of the world, have led experts to believe that they were created in prehistoric times and are possibly among the oldest ever discovered. Image copyright BBC Marathi ""Our first deduction from examining these petroglyphs is that they were created around 10,000BC,"" the director of the Maharashtra state archaeology department, Tejas Garge, told the BBC. The credit for their discovery goes to a group of explorers led by Sudhir Risbood and Manoj Marathe, who began searching for the images in earnest after observing a few in the area. Many were found in village temples and played a part in local folklore. ""We walked thousands of kilometres. People started sending photographs to us and we even enlisted schools in our efforts to find them. We made students ask their grandparents and other village elders if they knew about any other engravings. This provided us with a lot of valuable information,"" Mr Risbood told the BBC. Image copyright BBC Marathi Together they found petroglyphs in and around 52 villages in the area. But only around five villages were aware that the images even existed. Apart from actively searching for them, Mr Risbood and Mr Marathe have also played an important role in documenting the petroglyphs and lobbying authorities to get involved in studying and preserving them. Media caption Stunning aerial shots of India's prehistoric art Mr Garge says the images appear to have been created by a hunter-gatherer community which was not familiar with agriculture. ""We have not found any pictures of farming activities. But the images depict hunted animals and there's detailing of animal forms. So this man knew about animals and sea creatures. That indicates he was dependent on hunting for food."" Dr Shrikant Pradhan, a researcher and art historian at Pune's Deccan Collage who has studied the petroglyphs closely, said that the art was clearly inspired by things observed by people at the time. Image copyright BBC Marathi ""Most of the petroglyphs show familiar animals. There are images of sharks and whales as well as amphibians like turtles,"" Mr Garge adds. But this begs the question of why some of the petroglyphs depict animals like rhinoceroses and hippos which aren't found in India. Did the people who created them migrate to India from Africa? Or were these animals once found in India? The state government has set aside a fund of 240 million rupees ($3.2m; £2.5m) to further study 400 of the identified petroglyphs. It is hoped that some of these questions will eventually be answered.

Beth Skwarecki,"Forget the milk and eggs: If your power goes out, the last thing you want is a fridge full of perishables. Instead, here’s what to stock up on and how to plan ahead for a loss of power. Buy Stuff You Actually Like Don’t stock up on tuna if you hate tuna (unless it’s literally the only thing left at the store). For protein, you can try canned salmon, chicken, or beans instead. “I’ll eat this by candlelight when I’m hungry and desperate” is only a romantic idea when it’s not happening. And shop with meals in mind. Will you eat that canned chicken in a wrap? Better pick up some tortillas. If the grocery store shelves are bare, don’t be afraid to get creative. You can make PB&amp;J sandwiches on hot dog buns—and don’t let anybody tell you it’s a bad idea. Your Master List of Less Perishable Items Water. If there’s any chance you might lose water, fill every available container now. Bread, crackers, tortillas, buns Canned beans, chickpeas, lentils Canned fruit and vegetables Peanut butter and its kin Soy milk, almond milk, or any other milk-like substance that’s sold on shelves and not in the cooler section. You’ll want to chill these after opening, but they can sit in your pantry until then. Cereal (including oatmeal if you’ll have a way to prepare it) Anything that comes in a pouch and only calls for a minute or two of microwaving or boiling. If it says “pre-cooked” or “ready to eat,” you can just eat them cold. Snack bars, protein bars, Clif bars... anything in bar form. Anything that’s sold on a shelf when you buy it. Just check whether the package says you need to refrigerate after opening. Things in Your Fridge That Will Be Fine We keep a lot of things in our refrigerators that don’t really need to be there. Jam, for example, keeps longer in the fridge, but it won’t kill you at room temperature. Some things you can rescue from the fridge even if the power has been out a while: Hard cheeses Jams, jellies, syrups Peanut butter Bread and baked goods Many condiments, including soy sauce and vinaigrettes (check Still Tasty for shelf life guidelines) Fresh fruits and vegetables Butter The USDA has a list here of which refrigerated foods are still good after the power has been out. Freeze Everything Before the storm comes, pack some strategic things in your freezer: Water bottles, which can then act as ice packs to keep the rest of the food cold Perishable foods, like meats or leftovers. After a few days, if they still feel partially frozen, you can cook and eat them as if they were refrigerated the whole time. Frozen foods that you plan to eat when they are partially thawed. Plan Ahead for When Your Appliances Won’t Work If the power is out, you’ll be missing most of your appliances too: no way to turn on the microwave or an electric stove. If you have a gas-powered stove that will still work when the power is out, you may be able to light the burners with a long-reach lighter—so grab that lighter now. Is your can opener electric? Get a manual one. Will you perish without hot coffee? Get a thermos, and make yourself a pot of joe as soon as you start worrying about the power going out. If you have a balcony or a yard, consider the old-fashioned way of cooking food—with actual fire. Get some propane or charcoal and grill all your meals, or dig out the camp stove that you use when you’re backpacking. Even if you can only boil pots of water, a hot cup of tea or bowl of ramen will be a luxury when everything else is lukewarm.","Forget the milk and eggs: If your power goes out, the last thing you want is a fridge full of perishables.

KARLA CORNEJO VILLAVICENCIO,"“Undocumented children with representation are five times more likely to be successful in their cases, but the financial hardship these cases pose are often out of reach for low-income and undocumented families,” Jennifer K. Falcon, communications director for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services said. (The group, known as Raices, has agreed to give Brayan’s grandmother legal assistance.) In a recent phone call, Brayan described the living conditions at his shelter. He has a room of his own with a bed, dresser and radio. He said that many of the children shut themselves in their rooms to cry after their twice-a-week phone calls with their parents. Meals consist of cornflakes for breakfast and ham sandwiches for lunch and dinner. When I called Brayan, I could hear children crying in the background. Brayan sounded tired, perhaps because he is depressed or exhausted from crying. He said all the children were given a pill each day “so they wouldn’t get sick.” His grandmother said she was worried the pills were sedatives because he had been anxious about sleeping alone since his mother’s death, but he seemed to be sleeping well at the shelter. Shelter officials denied giving the children drugs. Brayan also said that he and the other children are required to sweep and mop floors and clean bathrooms. The shelter pays them “an allowance” of $7 a week — money they use to buy snacks to supplement meals that leave them hungry. Brayan told me he has taken it upon himself to comfort the youngest newcomers, telling them their parents wouldn’t like to see them cry. “The kids here are sad; they cry a lot,” he told me. “I tell them we’re getting out soon. I ask God that I get out of here and am reunited with my grandma soon.” The question is whether the government will allow that, and when. Brayan’s father told me he wants his son to live with his grandmother — and even had a lawyer draw up a letter attesting as much before they left Honduras. But there are no assurances the government will agree. Being a poor person of color is a strong mark against you in the foster care system. Tina Lee, an anthropologist who has described the child welfare system as “parallel to policing and incarceration,” told me that even American citizens who are relatives of children in foster care have a hard time getting custody because of discrimination against poor people and people of color. That means, she said, that “it is surely equally or doubly hard for undocumented family members.” Even more disturbing, the Department of Health and Human Services, which is in charge of the children, and the Department of Homeland Security have agreed to share data, including that of all the undocumented relatives who seek custody of the children. This almost certainly places those relatives in danger of deportation. Rosa says she will not be intimidated, but surely others will be. The Women’s Refugee Commission and National Immigrant Justice Center said it was clear “D.H.S. and H.H.S. see children as bait or suspects first, not children.” José described how in Honduras he’d walk home from work and begin to smile to himself as he anticipated seeing Brayan at the door, waiting to hurl himself at his father for a hug. He replays this image over and over in his head. He had dreamed of a new life with his son. Now separated by borders, he hopes his son will have a shot at a promising life with his grandmother. But the thought that he might not see him again is painful. “Brayan is sad. He’s in despair,” José said. “And I feel guilty. I threw my son away.” I tell him that he didn’t, that Brayan was taken from him. “I feel like crying, but what good is crying?” he replied. “So even though I am not religious, I pray. If only I could see him at the door now, it would make me so happy.” Karla Cornejo Villavicencio is an Emerson Fellow and a graduate student at Yale University.

Shackleton and his crew had to abandon Endurance in 1915 when it was crushed by sea ice and sank in 3,000m of water.
Their escape across the frozen floes on foot and in lifeboats is an extraordinary story that has resonated down through the years - and makes the wooden polar yacht perhaps the most sought-after of all undiscovered wrecks.
The British-led Weddell Sea Expedition has given itself five days to find the sunken remains.

Operating from the South African ice-breaker, the SA Agulhas II, the team will first put down an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to map the seafloor for anomalies. 
A wide box has been designated, and the robot, equipped with side-scan sonar, will run back and forth across this search zone like a lawnmower. Its first dive will last 45 hours.
If interesting targets are identified, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) will descend to investigate them.

 The SA Agulhas II will have to keep holes in the sea-ice open to operate the subs
There will be no attempt to retrieve artefacts should the Endurance be found. The intention only is to make a 3D model of the wreck site and to take photographs.
The search will be challenging because of the sea ice at the surface. The Agulhas will have to periodically shift its hull to maintain open holes in the floes, through which to launch and recover the robots. 
Particular care will be needed during any ROV dives because of the tether that runs from the ice-breaker down to the submersible.

 Frank Worsley used his sextant to record the position of the sinking
Scientists are extremely confident they are in the right place to find Endurance. 
Shackleton's skipper, Frank Worsely, was a very skilled navigator and used a sextant and chronometer to calculate the precise co-ordinates of the Endurance sinking - 68°39'30.0"" South and 52°26'30.0"" West.
The ship is almost certainly within a few nautical miles of this point - and there is every chance it is in reasonable condition.
The organisms that normally consume sunken wooden vessels do not thrive in the cold waters of the Antarctic, so even though the Endurance was broken when it went down, its timbers are most probably well preserved on the ocean floor.

 The Agulhas made good progress to the search site last week after picking up supplies
Just getting to the search site is a remarkable effort. The Agulhas has had to fight its way through ice that has thickened over several years.
Unlike Shackleton, however, the Weddell Sea Expedition team has been assisted by satellite ice charts, which make picking a way through the floes a lot easier.
The significance of the moment was not lost on the expedition's marine archaeologist, Mensun Bound: ""We are the first people here since Shackleton and his men!"" he was quoted as saying.

Virginia K. Smith,"When we rounded up our staff’s Weekly Upgrades last Friday, our editors were updating their skincare routines, diving feet first into the holiday spirit, and re-visiting long lost hobbies. This week, we’re experimenting with new creative routines, re-examining our retirement plans, clearing social media clutter, and making time for mental health. What upgrades did you make this week? Let us know in the comments. I recently started switching from Spotify to Apple Music, so I could listen to my streaming and owned music all in iTunes. (It’s technically possible on Spotify, but it’s hacky.) I can’t say I actually recommend it yet, but I really missed my old music! Still, all my friends are on Spotify, sharing good playlists, so I might… keep both? Like I’m some kind of sultan? nick douglas, staff writer The Nespresso (mini) is my upgrade! I only drink one cup of coffee per day, am very lazy, and prefer espresso to coffee (acid reasons) so this single-serve, ready-in-mere-moments situation is ideal for me. It’s also very small, which is great because my counters are overrun with sous-vide circulators. claire lower, food &amp; beverage editor This week I increased my 401(k) contributions by 2%. Initially it was going to be 1% but I figured why not up it to 2% and see if I can live comfortably that way. A new job/new year seems just as good a time as any to start saving more for retirement. alicia adamczyk, staff writer I got some fancy-looking leather gloves with cashmere lining that are touchscreen capable because I’ll be in NYC for almost two weeks and, well, it’s cold as shit there. patrick allan, staff writer I stopped fearing the “Unfollow” button on Facebook. My feed now has less drama and daily rants that make me feel all twitchy. michelle woo, parenting editor I’m not sure if this is quite an upgrade, but I made the decision to shell out for an extra therapy session next week ahead of holiday travel. It’s expensive (my therapist is out-of-network, unfortunately), but it’s really easy to forget to take care of myself in the holiday rush, so setting aside some extra time to keep my head on straight seemed well worth it. virginia k. smith, managing editor Inspired by Jaime’s endorsement of morning pages, I started reading the Artist’s Way. I don’t totally identify with the idea of being a “blocked” artist, but I’m looking forward to seeing what happens if I go through the tasks in the book. Next up: taking myself for an “artist date” someplace interesting—I’ve got my eye on the Center for PostNatural History. beth skwarecki, health editor If your career involves a bit of networking or social interaction with colleagues and clients, you might have a few beat-up business cards stuffed in your wallet, ready to hand out new people before you give away all two of them. After spending years apologizing for not having enough cards, I decided enough was enough. No longer would I carry my business cards in my wallet, where they’d end up a little worse for wear by the time I handed them out. I got a pair of sleek stainless steel business card cases from home goods store Muji. Each case holds 25 cards, more than enough for whatever engagement I’m attending. I keep one case at home and one in the office, just to ensure I’m prepared to share my contact information the old-fashioned way (in case you couldn’t tell, I don’t like handing people my phone).

Sarah Wells,"We know chimpanzees as intelligent, emotional creatures that make and use tools, grieve for their dead, and pass down traditions between generations. But less well-known is that different communities of chimps have unique culturesand that behavioral diversity that is shrinking, according to a new, 10-year study of chimpanzee groups in Africa.
The worlds population will hit a staggering 9.7 billion people in 2050, the United Nations estimates, with almost half that growth on the continent of Africa. More humans means the already dire habitat loss experienced by some of Earths most vulnerable and endangered speciesincluding our close cousin, the chimpanzeewill only get worse. And the unique cultures created within specific chimpanzee communities could be lost forever.
While humans are often fascinated by both our social and physical similarities to chimpanzees, such as our shared opposable thumbs and tender care for infants, this fascination has done little to actually protect the primates. Threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and disease, today wild chimpanzees can only be found in 21 countries in Africa, and both wild and captive chimpanzees are considered endangered. In addressing these issues, conservationists and primatologists have largely focused on the more easily observed losses of these communities, such population or genetic diversity, but new research from the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology has shed light for the first time on how human activity may result in the loss of chimpanzees behavioral and cultural diversity as well.
When you look at what has been published over the last decade, theres a lot about biodiversity and species diversity, but not about other levels of diversity, Hjalmar Kühl, a lead researcher on the paper, senior scientist at the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology, and researcher at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research, told Gizmodo. If you want to say anything about behavior its much more difficult.
Published in Science, the research is the culmination of a 10-year study of 144 chimpanzee communities in parts of Central Africa and its Western Coast. Through non-invasive observations using camera traps, fecal sampling, and tool reconnaissance, the research team was able to identify a significant difference in cultural and behavioral diversity between chimpanzee communities with higher human impact and those with lower. In communities with higher overall human impact, determined by factors such as nearby population density and infrastructure, the research found that these chimpanzees had an 88 percent lower probability of displaying diverse behaviors or traditions.
These behaviors and traditions, said Kühl, can be grouped into three distinct categories: resource extraction (for example, fishing for termites with a stick), communication, and thermoregulation (i.e. keeping cool, such as by bathing in water). While some of these behaviors are adaptations to the environment, others are unique between individual communities themselves.
There are some local traditions, like nut cracking or stone throwing, that the innovators of specific populations do, but individuals of another population with the same materials available dont do, said Kühl.
Kühl said that there is not one clear answer as to why these behaviors would be affected by proximity to humans, but there several possibilities. One explanation is the overall decrease in chimpanzee populations. As has also been demonstrated in humans, an overall decrease in populations can result in a decrease of cultural transmission as well. Kühl also said that habitat depletion, fragmentation, and change as a result of climate change could also contribute to how these communities display certain behaviorsas their environments change, they are unable to carry out environment dependent behaviors.
While a chimpanzee not fishing for algae or not communicating through stone throwing may not sound like a devastating loss to the untrained ear, Kühl said these losses are symptoms of a greater problem.
Its not that they are playing around and inventing something just for fun without an underlying purpose, said Kühl. Assuming theres adaptive value for at least some of the behavior, it also means they have to survive and interface with certain environments, [and] if they lose this behavior it is possible that it will somehow compromise their long-term survival.
With this in mind, in addition to conservation efforts that focus on protecting genetic diversity across species of chimpanzees, the researchers propose the creation of chimpanzee cultural heritage sites where behavioral and cultural diversity can be recognized and protected as well.
Chimpanzees are the species with the largest known behavior repertoire next to humans, said Kühl, and cultural heritage sites could help us further promote their conservation.

Julie Muncy,"Destiny 2 's latest expansion is lush, creative, and a vital shot of energy to a game that has been limping since it released. And I'm just not that into it. Destiny 2: Forsaken begins with a bang, as it kills one of its star characters, Cayde-6, a smart-alec gunslingin' scout who was never as funny or as interesting as Bungie thought he was. With Cayde dead, the tone sours and sharpens, turning into a bleak reflection on the moral grays of Destiny 's universe, pulling the player character on a Western-inflected journey for revenge. The Tangled Shore is a lawless, wild place, and Forsaken is all about frontier justice. Hunt baddies, get what's yours, and set right some wrongs. This all sounds well and good, and it comes with some stellar story missions, some truly creative long-term content ideas, and a bevy of improvements that Destiny 2 has needed since its start. Since its release last year, Destiny 2 has felt stifled, as if all the smartest improvements the original Destiny made to its systems over the years had been carved away or simply ignored in the quest to give players of Bungie's scifi shooter a fresh start. As such, it bled players, and instead of courting casual players for long-term play, it lost the interest of a lot of players of all intensities. I used to be one of those hardcore players. As a long-time lover of Bungie's games, I felt Destiny 's hooks in me early, and I stuck with it for years, through a long and increasingly predictable series of revivals. Bungie would release some vibrant, fascinating new glimpse into their gnarled world of arcane magic and space opera superheroes—a new story campaign, a new Raid or two, and a bunch of new guns to collect. I would play it, with friends, usually, sucking the marrow out of the expansion's bones. Eventually, problems would start to appear. Little intricacies of the currency systems, or the new guns, or the repetition of old play materials that started to grate. We would run out of things to do, and most of us would move on, flocking back to Destiny 's hallowed player hubs when the next expansion dropped. Destiny is, and has always been, a charismatic preacher always on the edge of a meltdown, a visionary pioneer with just enough brilliance and flinty intensity to bring the congregation back for a tent revival every now and then. And there's a joy to that, an exhilaration of constant renewal and return, a chance to see Destiny and play it for the first time again, and again, and again. It's an addictive rhythm. But after doing it for years, I think I'm just tired. I have a lot of friends enjoying the ride with Forsaken. So many interesting things seem to be happening. The Dreaming City late-game zone is a changing, wild place, replete with danger and mystery. Supplemental story materials are finally included in the core game, and they're just as beguiling and weird as they've always been. The guns, by all accounts, are pretty neat! And maybe I'll get there. But I'm feeling something new when I boot up Destiny 2, a sensation I've not had with this game in… well, ever. It's apathy. I'm sorry. Maybe it's not you, Destiny 2. But maybe it's time to move on. More Great WIRED Stories",Forsaken is a shot of energy to a game that has been limping since it released.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The cloud forests of Haitis Macaya National Park are believed to carry the worlds largest concentration of endemic amphibians. Island ecosystems are hotspots for biodiversity, and historically, Haiti was no different. But a dire new study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences claims the Caribbean country has less than 1 percent of its original primary forest left. By around 2035, all that forest is estimated to be gone, leaving Haitis wildlifefrom endemic orchids to the Mozarts frogwith no safe place to go. Or so, thats the story the study tells. Other researchers whove spent time in Haiti studying its forests arent sold on the methodology or the narrative around the need for untouched forests to support biodiversity. The study authors, who work with the Haiti Audubon Society, Temple University, the U.S. Forest Service, and Oregon State University, expect Haiti to lose up to 83 percent of its species by 2036. By their estimates, the country is in the throes of a mass extinction event. The researchers examined satellite images of the countrys forest cover from 1984 to 2016. In 1988, their analysis showed primary (aka undisturbed) forest made up 4.4 percent of Haitis total land cover. By 2016, that number had dipped to 0.32 percent. Only eight mountains in Haiti contain primary forest now, compared with 43 of the islands 50 mountains in 1988. The data shows that the secondary growth thats largely replaced Haitis original forestland supports a fraction of the biodiversity. The team checked out the 10 highest mountains firsthand between 2009 and 2015, and they found significantly more endemic species and species, in general, in primary forests. When looking at specific sites on these mountains, the average total species richness per site dropped 66 percent without primary forest. For endemics, that number stood at 88 percent. Why has primary forest become nearly non-existent in Haiti? Its complicated. The nations deforestation woes trace back to the 17th century when French colonizers invaded the land and cleared forests for slave plantations, per VICE. Since colonial times, modern agriculture and charcoal production have only exacerbated the loss of primary forest. The major 2010 earthquake didnt make anything better. While many environmentalists have historically blamed poverty and the people of Haiti people for the loss of treesin 2016, a meteorologist even made the wild (and false) claim that starving Haitian children eat themsome researchers who have spent time on the ground in Haiti have called claims of dramatic deforestation, including those made by the new study, overblown. Peter Wampler, a geology professor at Grand Valley State University, is one of them. Hes spent time in Haiti since 2007 and has seen firsthand the way community members take care in handling and protecting their trees. He knows that tree cover and biological diversity have decreased in the study period the authors examine, but Wampler also found the methodology subjective and biased to ensure that Haiti will eventually reach 0 [percent] primary forest cover, he wrote to Earther in an email. That, in turn, creates a hopeless situation for the people in Haiti who are the ones actually impacted by a loss of biodiversity and trees, he said. This articles use of a new forest cover definition, primary forest, makes it virtually impossible for Haitians to restore Haitis forests, Wampler said, as it seems by the definition applied, one cannot restore a primary forest. Wampler also pointed out that the study used a very strict definition of forest cover that only included primary growth and areas with 70 percent tree covermuch higher than standards the United Nations uses. Other studies that have used 10 percent as a threshold, for example, peg the country-wide forest cover at 32 percent. Andrew Tarter, an anthropologist whos studied the relationships people in Haiti have to trees, said in an email to Earther that this strict threshold represents a conservationist viewpoint. And he emphasized secondary tropical forest thats regrown should still support biodiversity. Thirty years of regrowth in the tropics represent trees of significant stature, he wrote to Earther. Even 10 years does. In response to these criticisms, author S. Blair Hedges, the director of Temple Universitys Center for Biodiversity, said the paper is only about facts (science), which should always be the basis of policy. No one disagrees that deforestation is a problem in Haiti. That doesnt make it any less complicated, though, especially in a place wrought with the scars of colonization and slavery. And many would argue hopeless numbers and expiration dates solve nothing. What Haitians need is an opportunity to restore the land they live and depend on every single day.","The cloud forests of Haiti’s Macaya National Park are believed to carry the world’s largest concentration of endemic amphibians.

Erin Griffith,"At best, advertising is something people tolerate while consuming media. At worst, it’s a turnoff. Media companies engage in a delicate balance between showing audiences enough ads to earn a profit without annoying them so much they leave altogether. A new study by internet radio service Pandora shows that too many ads can motivate users to pay for an ad-free version, but push many more to listen less or abandon the service. The study found that the additional subscription revenue does not make up for the lost ad revenue from those who listen less or leave the service. The findings are relevant as digital-media companies seek the proper balance of ad-supported and subscription-supported services. As internet users become more comfortable with paying for digital content, media companies from Netflix and Spotify to newspapers and magazines (including WIRED), are showing that subscription business models may be as attractive as free, ad-supported ones. “Culturally, we’re moving in the direction of no ads, or at least ad-lite, and it’s a real problem for everyone whose business models are built around advertising,” says Rich Greenfield, managing director and analyst at BTIG. “Our tolerance for our time being ‘wasted’ by untargeted, annoying ads is dropping rapidly because we’re getting more and more options that are ad-lite.” Greenfield noted that people are more likely to tolerate ads that are highly targeted. That’s worked for Facebook, because the company collects mountains of personal data in order to target ads. But recent criticisms over Facebook’s handling of its 2.2 billion users’ personal data have called that practice into question. COO Sheryl Sandberg told analysts Wednesday that the company has considered other forms of monetization, including paid subscriptions. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long said that replacing Facebook’s free model with a paid subscription service would limit the company’s mission of connecting the most people. Mission aside, it behooves Facebook to remain ad-supported, because that business is extremely profitable. The company reported 46 percent operating margins on $11.8 billion in first quarter revenue. As Bloomberg notes, that equates to roughly $20 per user per year, which would be a steep subscription price for many, particularly in developing countries. The Pandora study, authored by Jason Huang, a data scientist at Uber; David H. Reiley, an advertising scientist at Pandora; and Nickolai M. Riabov, a senior research scientist at Netflix, supports the notion that advertising is a more profitable path for a digital media company. The study was not peer-reviewed, as academic studies typically are. Pandora conducted the research itself, as opposed to commissioning the work from independent third party researchers. (Huang and Riabov were interns at Pandora.) The company did not respond to questions about whether it was offered a final edit of the paper. The paper refers to other studies of the subject, but does not present a robust “Literature” section that offers the perspective of previous research, as an academic paper would. However, its 21-month time frame and scale—almost 35 million users—make it unusual and notable. The authors write that the effects took almost a year to be realized, and a month-long experiment would have underestimated the long-term effects of the increased ads by a factor of three. The authors divided the Pandora users in the study into nine groups that were served different numbers of ads; some groups received twice as many ads as others. Consistently, the study showed that as the number of ads increased, users listened less. Serving one additional ad per hour resulted in a 2 percent decrease in average listening time and a 1.9 percent decrease in the number of days a user listened. The results were consistent across age groups, even though middle-aged users listen more hours than younger and older ones. Users who were served more ads were more likely to convert to Pandora’s ad-free subscription service, which costs $4.99 per month. Older users were twice as likely to convert to subscriptions as those under the age of 24, which the study’s authors attribute to older users having more disposable income. It may also be that younger users have less patience for ads. “There’s a reason why younger consumers are rapidly abandoning television,” which serves 18 minutes of ads per hour, Greenfield says. “It’s just a miserable experience with the ads.” In the experiment, the odds of someone signing up for a subscription increased by 0.14 percent for each additional ad served per hour. But those conversions came at a cost: For each user that become a subscriber, three others stopped using Pandora. The study notes that the subscription revenue earned by converting users to subscriptions is “considerably smaller” than the revenue Pandora would have earned through advertising to the users who decreased their listening or left the service. Pandora has struggled in recent years to keep pace with competition, as paid subscriptions to on-demand listening services have surpassed it. Spotify reports 159 million global users, 71 million of whom pay to subscribe, far exceeding Pandora’s 75 million users and 5.5 million subscribers. Apple Music, which has no free option, is on track to surpass Spotify in users this year, according to the Wall Street Journal. Earlier this month Spotify made efforts to attract more users to its free service—a key advantage it has over Apple’s subscription-only option – by adding a number of features including a data-saving option. The company boasted its 40 percent conversion rate to paid subscriptions, but noted that its mission and business model benefit from the scale of a free, ad-supported service. Many people turn to YouTube for free music streaming with ad interruptions, but the company has plans to change that by pushing users toward subscription offering. In March global music head Lyor Cohen told Bloomberg that YouTube planned to “frustrate and seduce” users into paying for subscriptions. The company may lose listeners in the process. Mark Mahaney, senior tech analyst at RBC Capital, said a subscription model for streaming services is more attractive than an ad-supported model, but only slightly. “If you were to pick one versus the other, you’d probably pick a subscription model,” he said. “The ideal solution may well be to have both.” Having assumed the market would rapidly swing toward subscriptions, he’s been surprised by how many people are willing to tolerate ads for a free streaming product. “We have seen a shift, but it’s not been a dramatic, huge shift in preference. There’s still a very large percentage of people that prefer a free, ad-supported service.” The Sound of Money","A 21-month study finds that as users are fed more ads, they listen less; some subscribe, but not enough to compensate for lost ad revenue.",2018-04-30T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","Pandora Learns the Cost of Ads, and of Subscriptions",https://www.wired.com/story/pandora-learns-the-cost-of-ads-and-of-subscriptions/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ae3bcc1ccc5a135912316e1/191:100/pass/pandora-pause-ads-FINAL.jpg,wired,Wired,lost,1
Elizabeth Svoboda,"Susumu Tonegawa ’s presence announces itself as soon as you walk through the door of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory. A three-foot-high framed photograph of Tonegawa stands front and center in the high-ceilinged lobby, flanked by a screen playing a looping rainbow-hued clip of recent research highlights. Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences. The man in the portrait, however, is anything but a spotlight-seeker. Most days, he’s ensconced in the impenetrable warren of labs and offices that make up Picower’s fifth floor. His hair, thick and dark in the photo, is now a subdued silver, and today, a loosely draped blue cardigan replaces the impeccable suit jacket. His accommodating, soft-spoken manner belies his reputation as a smasher of established dogma, or at least as a poker of deep and abiding holes. Along with his MIT neuroscientist colleague Dheeraj Roy and others, Tonegawa is upending basic assumptions in brain science. Early this year, he reported that memory storage and retrieval happen on two different brain circuits, not on the same one as was long thought. His team also showed that memories of an event form at the same time in the brain’s short-term and long-term storage areas, rather than moving to long-term storage later on. Most recently (and tantalizingly), his lab demonstrated what could someday be a way to bring currently irretrievable memories back into conscious awareness. Immunology was a transient interest for me. I wanted to do something new. Susumu Tonegawa Tonegawa, now MIT’s Picower Professor of Biology and Neuroscience, first carved out his maverick identity back in the 1980s. While at the Basel Institute for Immunology in Switzerland, he published a theory—first seen as heretical, then brilliant—that immune cells reshuffle their DNA to create millions of different antibodies from a small number of genes. His discovery won him the Nobel Prize in 1987, which explains the oversized lobby portrait. Most researchers would have stayed in the field and basked in the attention, but Tonegawa left immunology behind entirely. He spent the next couple of decades reinventing himself as a master of memory’s workings at the cellular level. Despite his professional stature, Tonegawa is no TED-circuit regular or fount of startup concepts. Instead of selling his ideas or his persona, he prefers to let his data speak for themselves. And they do, perhaps more loudly than some of his colleagues would like. “The way he continues to disrupt and innovate is really striking,” said Sheena Josselyn, a neuroscientist at Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children who also studies memory formation. “He tackles the tough questions. He doesn’t do something that is easy and expected.” Tracking Memories Cell by Cell Upon meeting Tonegawa, I sensed that he considers his fame a slightly cumbersome side effect of his vocation. The day I visited his office, he was immersed in research banter with a colleague, breaking away only reluctantly to revisit his own journey. The whole immunology sideline, he told me, was something of an accident—his real love has always been molecular biology, and immunology was a fascinating expression of that. He ended up at Basel mostly because his US work permit had run out. “Immunology was a transient interest for me,” he said. “I wanted to do something new.” That “something” turned out to be neuroscience, which Francis Crick and other well-known biologists were touting as the wave of the future. In the late 1980s and early ’90s, researchers knew relatively little about how the cellular and molecular workings of the brain underpin its capabilities, and nothing excited Tonegawa more than mapping unexplored territory. After making Nobel Prize-winning contributions to immunology, Susumu Tonegawa, now a professor of biology and neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, focused his passion for molecular biology on the brain. Tonegawa’s venture into brain science wasn’t a complete turnabout, though, because he brought some of his investigative techniques with him. He had been using transgenic (genetically modified) mice in his immunology studies, knocking out particular genes and observing the physical effects, and he used a similar approach to uncover the biological basis of learning and memory. In an early MIT study, he bred mice that did not produce a particular enzyme thought to be important in cementing long-term memories. Although the behavior of the mutant mice seemed mostly normal, further testing showed that they had deficiencies in spatial learning, confirming the enzyme’s key role in that process. With that high-profile result, Tonegawa was off and running. About 10 years ago, he was able to take his work to a new level of precision in part by employing a technique called optogenetics. Developed by the Stanford University bioengineer Karl Deisseroth and others, the technique involves modifying the genes of lab animals so that their cells express a light-sensitive protein called channelrhodopsin, derived from green algae. Researchers can then activate these cells by shining light on them through optical fibers. Tonegawa and his colleagues use optogenetics to generate neural activity on command in specified regions of the brain. This method has allowed Tonegawa to show that existing theories about memory formation and storage are wrong, or at least incomplete. This past summer, along with Roy and other colleagues, he reported that—contrary to neuroscience dogma—the neural circuit in the brain structure called the hippocampus that makes a particular memory is not the same circuit that recalls the memory later. Instead, retrieving a memory requires what the scientists call a “detour circuit” in the hippocampus’s subiculum, located just off the main memory-formation circuit. To illustrate the discovery for me, Roy called up an image of a magnified brain slice in the lab. “What you’re looking at is the hippocampus section of a mouse,” he said. He gestured to a dense cloud of glowing green neurons in the upper right—the subiculum itself—and explained that his team had genetically engineered the mouse to produce channelrhodopsin only in the subiculum’s neurons. He and his team could then activate or deactivate these subiculum neurons with piped-in laser light, leaving the surrounding neurons unaffected. Studies have shown that the hippocampus (red) is essential for creating new memories. But short-term recall of those memories depends on a “detour circuit” involving a specialized area called the subiculum (green). Armed with this biological switch, the researchers turned the subiculum neurons on and off to see what would happen. To their surprise, they saw that mice trained to be afraid when inside a certain cage stopped showing that fear when the subiculum neurons were turned off. The mice were unable to dredge up the fearful memory, which meant that the subiculum was needed for recall. But if the researchers turned off the subiculum neurons only while teaching the fearful association, the mice later recalled the memory with ease. A separate part of the hippocampus must therefore have encoded the memory. Similarly, when the team turned the main hippocampal circuit on and off, they found that it was responsible for memory formation, but not for recall. To explain why the brain would form and recall memories using different circuits, Roy framed it in part as a matter of expediency. “We think these parallel circuits help us quickly update memories,” he said. If the same hippocampal circuit were used for both storage and retrieval, encoding a new memory would take hundreds of milliseconds. But if one circuit adds new information while the detour circuit simultaneously calls up similar memories, it’s possible to apply past knowledge to your current situation much more quickly. “Now you can update on the order of tens of milliseconds,” Roy said. That difference might prove crucial to creatures in danger, for whom a few hundred milliseconds could mean the difference between getting away from a predator scot-free and becoming its dinner. The parallel circuits may also help us integrate present information with older memories just as speedily: Memories of a new conversation with your friend Shannon, for instance, can be added seamlessly to your existing memories of Shannon. Reassessing How Memories Form In addition to revealing that different mechanisms control memory formation and recall, Tonegawa, Roy and their colleague Takashi Kitamura (who recently moved from MIT to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) have shown that memory formation itself is unexpectedly complex. Their work concerned the brain changes involved in the transformation of short-term memories to long-term memories. (In mouse experiments, short-term memory refers to recollections of events from within the past few days—what is sometimes called recent memory to distinguish it from more transient neural impressions that flicker out after only minutes or hours. Long-term memory holds events that happened on the order of two weeks or more ago.) For decades in neuroscience, the most widely accepted model posited that short-term memories form rapidly in the hippocampus and are later transferred to the prefrontal cortex near the brain’s surface for long-term storage. But Tonegawa’s team recently reported in Science that new memories form at both locations at the same time. The road to that discovery started back in 2012, when Tonegawa’s lab came up with a way to highlight brain cells known as engram cells, which hold a unique memory. He knew that when mice take in new surroundings, certain genes activate in their brains. His team therefore linked the expression of these “experiential-learning” genes in the mice to a channelrhodopsin gene, so that the precise cells that activated during a learning event would glow. “You can demonstrate those are the cells really holding this memory,” Tonegawa said, “because if you reactivate only those neurons with laser light, the animal behaves as if recalling that memory.” In this magnified slice of brain tissue enhanced with an optogenetic protein, the green glow shows which engram cells in the hippocampus stored a short-term memory. In the new Science study, the team used this technique to create mice whose learning cells would respond to light. They herded each mouse into a special cage and delivered a mild electric shock to its foot, leading the mouse to form a fearful memory of the cage. A day later, they returned each mouse to the cage and illuminated its brain to activate the brain cells storing the memory. As expected, hippocampal cells involved in short-term memory responded to the laser light. But surprisingly, a handful of cells in the prefrontal cortex responded as well. Cortical cells had formed memories of the foot shock almost right away, well ahead of the anticipated schedule. Yet the researchers noticed that even though the cortical cells could be activated early on with laser light, they did not fire spontaneously when the mice returned to the cage where the foot shock happened. The researchers called these cortical cells “silent engrams” because they contained the memory but did not respond to a natural recall cue. Over the next couple of weeks, however, these cells seemingly matured and became integral for recalling the memory. “The dynamic is, the hippocampal engram is active [at first] and goes down, and the prefrontal-cortex engram is silent at the beginning and slowly becomes active,” Tonegawa said. This detailed understanding of how memories are laid down and stored could inform the development of drugs that aid formation of new memories. Some in the neuroscience community, however, think it’s prudent to be cautious in interpreting the significance of findings like these. Last year, Tonegawa’s MIT colleagues Andrii Rudenko and Li-Huei Tsai emphasized that engram science is still so new that we don’t know exactly how engram cells might work together, nor which cells contain which parts of memories. “In these early days of functional memory engram investigation,” they wrote, “we still do not have satisfactory answers to many important questions.” Tonegawa has asserted that brains contain silent engrams that could potentially be externally activated—an idea that strikes a few neuroscientists as overblown even as it excites others, according to Josselyn. “It really forces the scientific community to either update our thinking or try experiments to challenge that,” she said. Bringing Silent Memories to Life Despite the uncertainty that surrounds it, the silent-engram concept offers us the fascinating prospect of gaining access to hidden memories—a prospect that Roy, in particular, continues to explore. In October, he published a paper with Tonegawa that generated a flurry of excited emails from scientists and nonscientists alike. One of the paper’s blockbuster findings was that, at least in mice, it was possible to awaken silent engrams without using a laser light or optical fibers. Dheeraj Roy, a postdoctoral associate at MIT, has collaborated with Tonegawa on several recent studies that have overturned old ideas about how memory works. The question the team asked themselves, Roy said, was whether they could make hidden memories permanently active with a noninvasive treatment. A cellular protein called PAK1 stimulates the growth of dendritic spines, or protrusions, that allow communication between neurons, and Roy had a hunch that this protein—when transported into brain cells—might help bring silent engrams back into direct awareness. “Can we artificially put [in] more of one gene that would make more protrusions?” he asked, excitedly noting that this approach might be simpler than optogenetics. To test this possibility, the researchers first gave mild shocks to mice in a cage while also suppressing their ability to make the proteins that normally cement long-term memories. When these mice returned to the same cage later on, they showed no fear, indicating that they did not naturally recall the shock in response to a cue. Yet laser light could still switch on the mice’s fearful response, which meant the memory was still there in silent-engram form. When the team injected these mice with the PAK1 gene to make them overproduce the protein, the animals froze up spontaneously when entering the dreaded cage. They were recalling the memory of the cage all on their own: The silent engram was coming to life. When PAK1 is administered, “you just wait four days, [and] they recover it with natural cues,” Roy said. In the future, he added, a therapeutic injection of PAK1 molecules that enter the brain’s memory cells could awaken people’s silent memories as well. “So it would just be an injected protein?” I asked. “That’s right—one molecular transporter that has one protein. People already have ways to put proteins into brain cells. I don’t think we’re that far [away] anymore.” It could be these silent memories could come out. Susumu Tonegawa It’s amazing to think that all of our minds hold hundreds or thousands of silent memories that are just waiting for the right activation to re-emerge into conscious awareness. If Roy’s findings hold true in humans, the retrieval of hidden memories might someday be as easy to initiate as getting a flu shot. “What would happen if you did that to a normal person? What would come flooding back?” I asked. “What would that experience be like?” “Very sci-fi, even for me,” Roy said. “My family says, ‘Is this all real?’ I say, ‘Yeah, I’m not lying to you!’” A few minutes later, back in Tonegawa’s office, I posed more or less the same question to him. Reactivating silent engrams could allow people with memory issues—like Alzheimer’s sufferers, soldiers who have survived explosive blasts and concussed athletes in contact sports—to regain memories that have become inaccessible. (To be sure, these people would often need to get such treatments early, before their conditions progressed and too many brain cells died.) Roy and Tonegawa’s past research suggests that people with cognitive difficulties have many stored memories that they simply can’t recall. But what about the rest of us who just want to mine our memories, to excavate what’s buried deep within? Tonegawa paused to consider. “It could be these silent memories could come out,” he said. “If you artificially increase the spine density, inject enzymes which promote spine formation, then the silent engram can be converted to active engram.” When I pressed him further, though, he exuded caution. It was as if he was used to hearing people like me run away with the possibilities and wanted to tamp down my expectations. Even though his lab successfully reactivated mice’s silent engrams after a few days, that’s no guarantee that silent engrams last very long, he said. And once the cells that encode particular memories die off from old age or dementia, it might be game over, no matter what kind of proteins you inject. Tonegawa pointed to Roy, who was sitting across from him. “I won’t remember his name.” His patience seemed to be running out. The contrarian in him, I could tell, wanted to assert that he was a student of the essential nature of things, not a pursuer of drug patents or quick cures or even the ideal of perfect recall. “I know a joke,” he said cryptically. “Not injecting protein or genes, but I keep an external brain. I hold the information in that brain.” He pointed to Roy again—the person he counts on to remember things he can’t. “The only thing I have to do is have a relationship with that person,” he explained. It’s comforting, in a way, to know that the wizard of tracing and unlocking memories also believes that no brain is an island. “It’s better,” he said, “not to memorize everything.” Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.","Nobel laureate Susumu Tonegawa’s lab is overturning old assumptions about how memories form, how recall works and whether lost memories might be restored from \""silent engrams.\""",2017-12-21T14:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Light-Triggered Genes Reveal the Hidden Workings of Memory,https://www.wired.com/story/light-triggered-genes-reveal-the-hidden-workings-of-memory/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a39adf0b1aa2c7905f10584/191:100/pass/Memory_2880x1405-2880x1405.jpg,wired,Wired,lost,1

Mallory Locklear,"To get a better idea of this meteorite's history, scientists used transmission electron microscopy to study its composition and they found deposits of chromite, phosphate and iron-nickel-sulfide trapped within diamonds contained in the meteorite. And those observations gave them some clues as to how the diamonds formed. Their work was published today in Nature Communications. Diamonds are often found in this family of meteorites, but they're usually pretty tiny. And researchers say there are three main ways they can form -- during a major collision, through the deposit of chemical vapor or through sustained high pressure and temperature, like the way diamonds form here on Earth. The size of the diamonds in this meteorite, which were larger than others', aren't compatible with the first two methods, meaning they likely formed through high pressure within some sort of major astronomical body. And the metal deposits found within them would likely have formed in a young planet at least the size of Mercury and maybe as large as Mars, according to the researchers. Models have predicted that a number of protoplanets existed during the early years of our solar system and that through accretions and collisions helped form the existing terrestrial planets and some of their moons. Though there's no way to know what exactly happened to the ""lost"" planet that formed these diamonds, it was likely destroyed through collisions billions of years ago.

NATE COHN,"These fundamentals provide only a rough sense of what might happen in an election year. But in this case, they seem to line up with everything else. In the special election in Arizona on Tuesday, the Republican, Debbie Lesko, won by just five points in a district that Donald J. Trump won by 21 points. There were no excuses for Republicans: The candidates were typical, the turnout was typical, and the G.O.P. fought hard for the district. On average, Democrats have run 14 points ahead of a district’s partisanship (as measured by the last two presidential elections, compared with the national popular vote) in special elections for Republican-held districts so far this cycle. They’ve run more than 20 points ahead on three occasions — Kansas’ Fourth, Pennsylvania’s 18th and Arizona’s Eighth — and that doesn’t include Doug Jones’s victory in the Alabama Senate race. These Democratic over-performances are a startling departure from the Obama years, when congressional election results polarized along national political lines. Over the more than 1,000 special and general House elections in Democratic-held districts in the Obama era, there were only four elections when the Republicans ran 20 points ahead of the district’s lean in presidential elections. This cycle’s Democrats have pulled it off three times out of seven. In a broader historical context, though, the Democratic over-performance is not quite as startling. It is still impressive, but the Democrats ran 20 points ahead of a Republican-held district’s presidential partisanship in 31 races combined in 2006 and 2008. Over all, the Democrats’ performance in 2018 special congressional elections looks a lot like their showing in open districts in 2006, and well above the average from wave elections in 1994, 2006, 2008 and 2010.

ASHLEY SOUTHALL and LUIS FERRÉ-SADURNÍ,"But the world the Stewarts made for themselves here was shattered on Dec. 28, when a fire, which was started by a 3-year-old boy playing with a stove, raced through the brown-brick building. Of the five families who lost loved ones, by count, the Stewarts lost the most. The coffins inside the funeral home proved too much to bear for the relatives who filed in on Monday under an ominous sky. Loud cries and deep moans pierced the chill inside Chapel A, as relatives wondered how something so unfathomable could possibly be real. “God, what my children does do that you just wipe out the page, nothing left, not even a line?” Ms. Stewart pleaded. “Jesus, where do I go from here?” In the vestibule, her daughter Shevan Stewart, who lived on the first floor of the building, fainted, then woke up shouting, “The fire, the fire, the fire!” Photo Shevan Stewart mourning beside the bodies of her nieces, Kylie Francis, left, and Kelesha Francis, 7. Credit Andres Kudacki for The New York Times Her brother Rudolph said she was having flashbacks: “She tried to save them. She’s taking it very hard.” The funeral was a ritual that other families — the Donkors, the Sarkodies, the Mensahs — will endure over the coming weeks as they say goodbye to those who died in the fire. A funeral was held Sunday for the youngest victim of the fire, 7-month-old Amora Batiz, and her grandmother, Maria Batiz, 65. Andrene Paul, Ms. Stewart-Francis’s sister, set up a GoFundMe page to send the bodies back to Jamaica for burial. Ms. Stewart-Francis wanted to be buried with her father, with whom she was “joined at the hip,” Ms. Paul said. For the Stewarts, the outcome could have been even worse: They occupied five units in the Prospect Avenue building and everyone was home when the fire started. Ms. Young, who lived on the basement floor with her parents, had been visiting her aunt Karen’s fifth-floor apartment. The pair were known as the family divas, stylish and never ones to miss a nail appointment. They died with Kelesha and Kylie after being overcome by smoke in the bathroom where they sought shelter. Mr. Francis died last week after he was taken off life support. Ms. Young was “like a model,” Ms. Paul, her aunt, said, miming the way her niece walked, with a sassy swish in her hips. And Ms. Stewart-Francis, she said, behaved as if she were just as young as their niece. “She’s such a vibrant person,” Ms. Paul said. Kelesha, a student at P.S. 205 Fiorello LaGuardia in the Bronx “enjoyed playing make believe” and was “sweet and obedient,” according to an obituary. Kylie liked to make faces and was called to “the ‘happy feet’ baby that loved to shine.” Ms. Stewart-Francis was the youngest of her parents’ 13 children. Six brothers and four sisters remain. She was born in Spanish Town, Jamaica, and immigrated to the United States with her father, Joseph, in 1998. Her mother had left for the United States in the 1980s, and more family followed in the 2000s. Photo Mourners at the funeral for members of the Stewart family on Monday.

Credit Andres Kudacki for The New York Times In recent years until her death, she worked as a housekeeper for a hotel in Manhattan, near the United Nations, Ms. Paul, her sister, said. Ms. Stewart-Francis met her husband while on vacation in Jamaica in 2012, according to her sister. Sparks flew and Mr. Francis later proposed to her. “She came to us and said, ‘Guess what, I’m gonna get married,’” Ms. Paul said. “She was so excited.” Kylie was born Sept. 26, 2015, and early the following year Mr. Francis and Kelesha, his daughter from a previous relationship, joined them in the Bronx after receiving a spousal visa. The couple married in May, Ms. Paul said. Mr. Francis found work hard to come by in Jamaica, his brother said, and he believed he would have better prospects in the United States — and at least he would be with his young family. His departure was bittersweet for his family, which included eight other brothers and eight sisters, his twin brother said. “We understood that he was going away for a better life, but we also didn’t want him to leave us,” Iholt Francis said. “It was a mixed feeling.” A few weeks before he died, Mr. Francis started a job sorting recyclables at Action Environmental Services, a waste-management company in the Bronx. But it was a means to an end, his brother said. Holt was saving money to go to vocational school to become an electrician. “He’s a hands-on person, so anything that involves using hands, building stuff, that’s what he was good at,” Iholt Francis said. During the funeral, he paid tribute to his brother and said that the loss left him struggling with suicidal thoughts. Mourners in the crowd pleaded, “There is hope, brother,” and “Mercy.” On Thursday, he went to Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx to give doctors permission to let his brother, who had been declared brain dead, die. But before they took him off life support, Mr. Francis said he took a few moments alone with his twin. “I sat there,” Iholt Francis said. “I held his hand. I told him I loved him. Kissed him. And in that moment I just wished that it would be enough, that it would be the miracle that he needed to come back to this world. But I don’t think that he could have survived knowing his family had left this world.” Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

According to the Associated Press, a fire at an underground Georgia Power facility was the source of ATL’s outage. It managed to damage two different substations, knocking out the airport’s primary and backup systems.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright SPL Image caption Artwork: The diamond-bearing meteorites may have come from a proto-planet in the early Solar System A diamond-bearing space rock that exploded in Earth's atmosphere in 2008 was part of a lost planet from the early Solar System, a study suggests. The parent ""proto-planet"" existed billions of years ago before breaking up in a collision and would have been about as large as Mercury or Mars. A team has published their results in the journal Nature Communications. They argue that the pressures necessary to produce diamonds of this kind could only occur in planet of this size. Using high-definition microscopy, the researchers measured the composition of diamonds locked up in rocks left scattered in the Nubian desert of northern Sudan after the asteroid 2008 TC3 hit the atmosphere. The measurements provide ""the first compelling evidence for such a large body that has since disappeared"", the research team write in their paper. The finding also boosts the theory that today's Solar System planets were forged from the remains of tens of large ""proto-planets"". The meteorites from this collision fall into a category of space rocks called ureilites, which account for less than 1% of objects that collide with Earth.

CHIN-HUAT WONG,"One result of this tug of war over how to promote Islam in politics is that if the notion of making Shariah the official law of Malaysia was a fringe idea in the late 1980s, by 2013, 86 percent of Malaysian Muslims supported it, according to a study by the Pew Research Center. Some people celebrate this month’s election as marking Malaysia’s move away from communal politics, pointing to the fact that Pakatan Harapan, a diverse grouping of parties representing different ethnic groups, has downplayed communal issues to focus on national matters, like corruption and an unpopular tax on goods and services. But they are overlooking some facts: Pas secured nearly 18 percent of the popular vote, 18 seats in the lower house of Parliament and control of two state governments. Though Pas had done better at the federal level in previous elections, these are impressive results considering that it joined forces with Barisan Nasional in recent years: It appears not to have been too tainted by the association. Pas now has little reason to moderate its core stances — and UMNO may have more reason to endorse them. Likewise, Barisan Nasional’s indigenous parties in Sabah and Sarawak may be tempted to double down on their traditional appeal to historical grievances in the two Bornean states — poverty, marginalization and exploitation by the central government — and harden their calls for greater autonomy and someday perhaps even separatism. Reacting to such concerns, Mr. Mahathir has recently said that new defectors would not automatically be granted formal membership in Pakatan Harapan. But that measure will only slow down, rather than stop, Pakatan Harapan’s slide toward becoming another overbearing ruling coalition, unless a healthy opposition can be groomed outside Pakatan Harapan. It is unlikely that Barisan Nasional as we know it will last through the year: not only because of its searing loss in the election, but also because of the likely fallout ahead from the scandals embroiling the former prime minister Najib Razak. Much may depend on whether UMNO can oversee a changing of the guard during its next party election, currently scheduled for June 30. But much more depends on Pakatan Harapan. After the 1970s, Barisan Nasional essentially turned Malaysia into an electoral one-party state. To prevent that from occurring again, the new government will eventually have to dismantle the country’s winner-takes-all system. A proportional electoral system is needed to cut across the country’s ethnoreligious and regional identities. Decentralizing and devolving more authority to the states, as well as restoring city elections, could also encourage moderation among opposition parties by offering them more opportunities to have some executive powers and access to resources. In the meantime, Malaysians must realize that there can be no good government if there is no good opposition. And Pakatan Harapan must realize that the best thing it can do for Malaysia’s democracy is what Barisan Nasional never did: protect its adversaries.",That’s what Malaysian politicians are doing — and it’s bad for our democracy.,2018-05-29T10:29:21Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Just Lost An Election?

Ed Cara,"An unorthodox beauty treatment meant to rejuvenate the feet turned into disturbing medical mystery for one young woman. According to a case report published by her doctor in JAMA Dermatology, the woman’s toenails stopped growing and started falling off soon after she received a so-called fish pedicure. Fish pedicures involve having small fish nibble at your feet while they’re soaked in a tub of warm or room temperature water. The species of fish used—a toothless carp known as Garra rufa —are usually plant eaters, but in a pinch, they’ll also eat dead human skin. The fish’s voracious feasting is said to help treat conditions like psoriasis as well as beautify the skin, lending them the nickname of “Doctor Fish.” Unfortunately for the unnamed woman in her 20s, her experience was anything but rejuvenating. Following her pedicure, most of her toenails on both feet stopped growing and began to fall off, a condition known as onychomadesis. Six months into her nail troubles, she visited a dermatologist, who ruled out any known causes of onychomadesis, such as major illness or a side effect of certain medications. The most likely culprit, then, was the fish pedicure. “While the mechanism of action is not entirely clear, it is likely due to the fish traumatizing the nail matrix,” Sheri Lipner, an assistant professor of dermatology at Columbia University’s Weill Cornell Medicine and the woman’s treating doctor, told Gizmodo via email. The case, as far as Lipner knows, would be the first documented instance of onychomadesis ever caused by fish. For the sake of protecting her patient’s anonymity, Lipner can’t reveal where the woman got her pedicure. But she notes these treatments are fairly popular outside of the US, such as in China. They hit their peak in popularity stateside around a decade ago, but have since been banned in at least 10 states, including New York, largely because of health concerns. For one, the fish are often used on more than one person, making the risk of transmitting infections a real possibility. And though proponents of fish pedicures have argued they can properly sanitize the fish and tubs between uses, research has shown that disease-causing bacteria can be readily found in both the tubs and fish used in these spas. A few case reports have also directly traced foot infections to these treatments. “I do not recommend fish pedicures for any medical or aesthetic purpose,” Lipner said. “In addition to onychomadesis, there are also serious infections associated with fish pedicures.” As for the woman, her nails will likely return, but not for a long time. Lipner notes that our toenails only grow one millimeter a month on average, while an entire nail can take as long as 18 months to be replaced. “Therefore, we will have to wait quite a while to see the outcome,” she said.

EMILY BADGER,"Trump is continually stoking these feelings of resentment, of loss, said Daniel Cox, the research director with the Public Religion Research Institute. If youre already primed to feel that way, getting a sort of regular dose of that kind of rhetoric I think would cause you to continue to believe it. P.R.R.I. surveyed people about whether they felt like strangers in their own country shortly before the 2016 election, and again in 2017. The share of white men with no college degree saying this didnt decline as a result of Mr. Trumps election it inched up to 49 percent from 48 percent. The share of African-Americans saying the same rose to 59 percent from 48 percent (almost identical to what Times polls have found). Mr. Cox suggests, though, that while this sense of estrangement has been politically valuable to Mr. Trump in animating Republican voters, the same probably wont be true for Democrats. Feelings of loss on the left a weakening of values around voting rights, abortion rights, LGBT tolerance arent as easily bound together in a singular cultural narrative. The fact that feeling like a stranger in your own land can encompass all of these values is part of what makes it a powerful indicator of the American mood. The idea touches something more fundamental than policy preferences, more personal than how people view individual leaders. This does get at something a little bit deeper, that Im really troubled by insert your own thing, said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster. Im troubled by these political divisions, Im troubled by how things are going culturally, Im troubled by crime and the lack of moral fiber. I dont think this sort of limits you. There may even be something hopeful in the fact that many Americans are deeply troubled about something if not the same thing. It is evidence of a healthy process, said Heather Cox Richardson, a historian at Boston College. In the 1850s and the 1920s, she said, similar moments of widespread disaffection and anger with powerful elites led to broad grass-roots movements that gave way, in their time, to the birth of the Republican Party and later the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It is also evidence, she said, of an exceedingly dangerous process for the people who are in power.

Kate Clark,"Backed with nearly $87 million in venture capital funding from GV, Oak HC/FT and F-Prime Capital, Quartet Health was founded in 2014 by Arun Gupta, Steve Shulman and David Wennberg to improve access to behavioral healthcare. Its mission : “ enable every person in our society to thrive by building a collaborative behavioral and physical health ecosystem.” Recent shakeups within the New York-based company’s c-suite and a perusal of its Glassdoor profile suggest Quartet’s culture is not fully in line with its own philosophy. In the last few weeks, chief product officer Rajesh Midha has left the company and president and chief operating officer David Liu is on his way out, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed with Quartet. Founding chief executive officer Arun Gupta, meanwhile, has stepped into the executive chairman role, relinquishing responsibility of the company’s day-to-day operations to former chief science officer David Wennberg, who’s taken over as CEO. “I’m focusing on our external growth,” Gupta told TechCrunch on Friday. “David has really stepped up as CEO.” Gupta and Wennberg said Liu’s role was no longer needed because Wennberg had assumed his responsibilities. Liu will formally exit the company at the end of the month. As for its product chief, the pair say Midha had “transitioned out” of the role and that an unnamed internal candidate was tapped to replace him. When asked whether other employees had left in recent weeks, Wennberg provided the following indeterminate statement: “We are always having people coming in. I don’t think we’ve had any unusual turnover. We’re hiring and people’s roles change and that’s just part of growth.” Quartet, which provides a platform that allows providers to collaborate on treatment plans, currently has 150 employees, according to its executives. In a LinkedIn status update published this week — after TechCrunch’s initial inquiries — Gupta announced his transition to executive chairman: “Still full-time, though focused largely on our opportunity to further evangelize our mission, [I will] drive the change we want to see in this world, and expand our reach … I have tremendous confidence in Davids ability to lead our many talented Quartetians to deliver this next phase.” Several former employees seemed less than pleased with Gupta’s performance, writing in a number of Glassdoor reviews that he was “abominable,” “kind of a monster” and “by far the worst executive.” When asked for comment on those reviews, Gupta and Wennberg shrugged it off: “ Glassdoor is Glassdoor.” They agreed its important to pay attention to but impossible to vet. Gupta began his career as a management consultant at McKinsey and served as a consultant to The World Bank before joining Palantir, Peter Thiel’s data-mining company, as an advisor in 2014. Wennberg, for his part, was the CEO of The High Value Healthcare Collaborative, a consortium of 15 healthcare delivery systems, before co-founding Quartet. In January, Quartet raised a $40 million Series C to expand throughout the U.S. F-Prime Capital and Polaris Partners led the round, with participation from GV and Oak HC/FT. The financing valued the company at $300 million, according to PitchBook. As part of the funding, Quartet announced it was adding three new directors to its board: F-Prime’s executive partner Carl Byers ; Ken Goulet, an executive vice president at health insurance provider Anthem; and former Rackspace CEO and BuildGroup co-founder Lanham Napier. Other outside board members include Oak HC/FT’s managing partner Annie Lamont, GV partner Krishna Yeshwant, Polaris managing partner Brian Chee and former U.S. Congressman Patrick Kennedy. Quartet previously raised a $ 40 million Series B in April 2016 led by GV. The investment marked the venture capital investment arm of Google’s first in a mental health startup. Before that, the startup brought in a $7 million Series A led by Oak HC/FT’s managing partner Annie Lamont. For now, Quartet remains committed to growth. “We learn from what we are doing and we continue to learn,” Wennberg said. “That is part of growth.

SpaceX has consistently claimed that its Falcon 9 rocket worked perfectly—a claim with added credence, now that the U.S. Air Force has said it’s not going to dismiss the rocket company’s right to vie for military contracts. Everything seemed to go fine during the January 7 launch, with initial reports suggesting Zuma made it successfully to low Earth orbit. But in the days that followed it became clear that something had gone wrong, with the spy satellite being declared a “ total loss.” Contradictory accounts are emerging in the wake of the apparent failure of the Zuma mission—a… Read more Read This multibillion-dollar mission remains classified, so information is hard to come by. U.S. lawmakers have been briefed about the loss of the satellite, but virtually nothing has been disclosed to the public. In an emailed statement to Gizmodo, SpaceX said: For clarity: after review of all data to date, Falcon 9 did everything correctly on [January 7]. If we or others find otherwise based on further review, we will report it immediately. Information published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false. Due to the classified nature of the payload, no further comment is possible. Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman—the company contracted out by the U.S. Air Force to provide the payload adapter—refused to say anything at all, citing the classified nature of the mission. Now, as Bloomberg reports, the U.S. Air Force has shown great confidence in SpaceX, telling the news outlet that the Falcon 9 rocket “did everything correctly,” and that, “based on the data available, our team did not identify any information that would change SpaceX’s Falcon 9 certification status” following “a preliminary review of telemetry that was available to us from” the launch. That said, Air Force officials said they’ll continue to “evaluate data from all launches.” This is obviously great news for Elon Musk, whose company was certified by the Air Force in 2015 to compete alongside United Launch Alliance/Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corporation for military contracts. SpaceX remains eligible to bid for 11 launches from now till the end of the 2019 fiscal year. But while the U.S. Air Force’s vote of confidence looks good for SpaceX, it doesn’t look so hot for Northrop Grumman. Suspicions that the company’s payload adapter—a device that physically separates the satellite from the upper part of the rocket during deployment—is the part that failed now seem more plausible. Normally, SpaceX provides a payload adapter, but Zuma planners insisted on a device manufactured by the defense firm. All this said, we still don’t know what happened. Maybe the satellite failed to power up at separation, or it accidentally put itself in an orbit that sent it hurtling towards Earth. Or the conspiracy theorists are right, and Zuma is alive and well.

Swapna Krishna,"The launch, aboard the GSLV-F08 rocket, appeared to go smoothly, and the satellite successfully completed an orbital maneuver following its deployment into geosynchronous transfer orbit. GSAT-6A was then supposed to execute another operation to raise its orbit a day later. About four minutes after that maneuver occurred, officials lost contact with the satellite. The successful launch of GSAT-6A was seen as a huge triumph for India's space program, so this is certainly a setback. The country has been developing a robust space program capable of competing on the world stage for years. It doesn't help that this is the second satellite that the agency has lost in the last six months; the last failure was one of the launch vehicle PSLV, rather than the satellite itself. Still, all is not lost. ISRO Chairman K. Sivan told The Hindu that, according to the data the organization has right now, ""we expect that we will be able to recover the satellite.""

REGGIE UGWU,"And then it all went to pieces. As manufactured pop groups tend to do. Only in this case, the split seemed sudden and surprisingly vicious: One day, Fifth Harmony was performing at the final stop of the Jingle Ball tour, smiling and hair-flipping. The next, a series of contentious and contradictory statements were released, and Ms. Cabello found herself on the lonely end of a sharp divide. Photo Fifth Harmony, a five-woman group assembled from contestants that had auditioned for the show solo, competed on “The X Factor” in 2012. Credit Fox/Getty Images That was just over a year ago. In the interim, Ms. Cabello has struck out on her own, putting her hands on the controls of her professional life for the first time. Her new album, “Camila,” arriving Jan. 12, will test her prospects as a solo proposition. The biggest stars to break away from groups — Michael Jackson, Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé — did so from stronger footing, in eras when the music industry was thriving. Today, Ms. Cabello is just one in a cacophony of voices aiming to break through in a harsh, post-streaming environment. “It’s not easy for anybody, regardless of your starting point,” said Tom Poleman, the chief programming officer for the radio conglomerate iHeartMedia, which recently booked Ms. Cabello solo for its Jingle Ball. “The field is so competitive that you really need the planets to align.” At times, sole proprietorship has been overwhelming, with people constantly asking Ms. Cabello for her creative input or asking what happened with Fifth Harmony — a subject she does her best to avoid. “I think there’s a healthy amount of space you need to give certain things,” she said. And so for 11 days in late December, in the cocoon of her hometown, she took a break. She settled into old rhythms at her family home and came to Pinecrest to pick up her younger sister, Sofia, only after wresting herself from a savored “Sex and the City” binge. (“In my heart I’m a Carrie, but sadly I think I act like a Charlotte,” she said.) On a tour of its green, al fresco campus, wearing True Religion overalls with one suspender undone and black hightop Chuck Taylors, she looked at ease and made everyone around her feel the same. An old teacher asked whether she would be going on tour soon and she said she was in no rush. “For now,” she said, “I just want to be a kid.” Ms. Cabello comes from a lineage of strivers. She was born in Havana to a Cuban mother and Mexican father and moved back and forth between Cojímar and Mexico City until age 6. One day, her mother, Sinuhe, told her she was going to Disney World, and the two spent the next month together riding by bus to an immigration center at the Mexican border with the United States. Sinuhe had been an architect in Cuba, but in Miami, where she and her daughter moved in with a close family friend, she found work in the shoe department at a Marshall’s. Photo Ms. Cabello said she avoids talking about Fifth Harmony’s split. “I think there’s a healthy amount of space you need to give certain things.” Credit Natalia Mantini for The New York Times Alejandro, Ms. Cabello’s father, emigrated later and earned money washing cars at the mall. Eventually the couple saved enough to start their own construction company. “My parents’ story helps me to know what’s important in life,” Ms. Cabello said. “A lot of times you can be here and be on Twitter and you think that the world is the internet. But I know what it’s like in the places my family has come from and the struggles people go through.” It caught Sinuhe and Alejandro by surprise when, for her 15th birthday in 2012, Ms. Cabello asked them to drive her to audition for the second season of “The X Factor.” “She was so shy, so shy,” said Sinuhe, who now travels with her daughter on the road, describing how her oldest child would regularly burst into tears at family parties with large crowds and loud music. “We didn’t even think music was a possibility for her,” Sinuhe said. In Fifth Harmony — with Ally Brooke, Dinah Jane, Lauren Jauregui and Normani Kordei — Ms. Cabello was living a dream. The group performed at the White House (twice) and released addictive hits like “Worth It” and “Work From Home” that alone racked up over one billion streams, according to Nielsen Music, and earned them legions of fiercely loyal fans. But dreams can change. In a statement released at midnight on Dec. 18, 2016, the four other members of the group suggested that Ms. Cabello had turned her back on them, communicating her intentions to leave “through her representatives.” Ms. Cabello, in a subsequent statement of her own, said that she had long been open about her desire to explore a solo career and was blindsided by what amounted to a public excommunication. Over a feast of Cuban food at one of her family’s favorite restaurants in Miami, and in a subsequent interview in New York a week later, she agreed to speak at length about how things fell apart. Photo Ms. Cabello during her school days in Cuba. She came to the United States when she was 6. She said that her collaboration in late 2015 with Mr. Mendes — the first time a Fifth Harmony member released music under her own name — had created tension; t hat she had asked to help write lyrics for Fifth Harmony songs and was rebuffed; that she initially wanted to stay in the group while working on a solo album but the other members shut her out instead. “I was just curious and I wanted to learn and I saw all these people around me making music, writing songs and being so free,” she said. “I just wanted to do that and it did not work.” Ms. Cabello said that after the awkwardness of her collaboration with Mr. Mendes, things further soured when she began attending writing sessions with producers including Diplo, Cashmere Cat and Benny Blanco. Eventually, she said, she was given an ultimatum. “It became clear that it was not possible to do solo stuff and be in the group at the same time,” she said. So she made her choice, basing it on what she said was her conviction that “if anyone wants to explore their individuality, it’s not right for people to tell you no.” Since the breakup, Ms. Cabello has tried to move on from hard feelings, throwing herself into “Camila.” (She changed its name from “The Hurting, the Healing, the Loving” partly to wash her hands of drama.) But it hasn’t always been easy. In August last year, the remaining members took a less-than-subtle jab at their former groupmate with a stunt that opened a high-profile performance at the MTV Video Music Awards. As the camera zoomed in on a dark, elevated platform showing five women in silhouette, one was dramatically yanked off the stage as if hit by a truck. Ms. Cabello’s eyes welled up as she recalled watching it live. She had been at home in the living room with her mother. “It definitely hurt my feelings,” she said. “I wasn’t expecting it, I wasn’t prepared for it — especially because at that point I’d moved on from it. I was just like, ‘What? Why?’” Photo Ms. Cabello’s collaboration with Shawn Mendes, “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” was the first time a Fifth Harmony member released music under her own name. Credit Cooper Neill/Getty Images for iHeartMedia She gathered herself. “I have to make space for the good stuff to happen in my life,” she said. “I don’t like holding onto the past, especially when it’s stuff that, in my opinion, is just petty.” Like the pop astronauts who went solo before her, Ms. Cabello is now both a known quantity and a blank slate, caught between an outsize past and an uncertain future. Her first single as a solo artist was an early artifact of this wobbly developmental period. “Crying in the Club” — an arch, dancehall-flecked power ballad released last spring — was produced by Benny Blanco from an original demo written and recorded by Sia. The track underperformed commercially and was left off the final track list of “Camila.” “The reality of that song is it doesn’t feel or sound like Camila,” said Roger Gold, Ms. Cabello’s manager and a former lawyer for Fifth Harmony. Mr. Gold said it took time for Ms. Cabello, free of the army of handlers and tacticians who maintained creative control of the girl group, to feel comfortable asserting herself in front of more seasoned collaborators. “The most important learning in this whole thing was that we were most successful when Camila trusted in her own instincts,” he said. A breakthrough came while she was working with the producer Frank Dukes, born Adam Feeney, who has made his name as a prolific but low-key co-conspirator of self-styled stars like Drake and Lorde. Many potential collaborators had come to the studio armed with sleek, brassy Top 40 munitions in the style of Fifth Harmony hits. But Mr. Feeney’s approach was more nonchalant. Over sushi during an early session with Ms. Cabello last winter, he played her a deceptively simple instrumental with a prominent salsa piano riff. It reminded the singer of her birthplace, and she wrote the chorus for what became “Havana” on the spot. “There’s not another artist in the world who could have done that song — she just owns it,” Mr. Feeney said. Many of the songs on “Camila,” which Mr. Feeney executive produced and includes writing by Ms. Cabello on every track, are infused with tonal or lyrical references to her Latin heritage. Ms. Cabello said she took inspiration from the Latin music that soundtracked her childhood, as well as more contemporary reggaeton revisionists like Calle 13 and J Balvin. Then she blended those sounds with the auteur pop of artists like her friends Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran, hoping to unearth her own original recipe. “I feel like the best way to come up with something new and different is just to be the you-est you possible,” Ms. Cabello said. “If you pull from all the different little parts of yourself, nobody can replicate that.” Mr. Poleman, of iHeartMedia, said it is Ms. Cabello’s sensibilities as a songwriter that will define her career. With “Havana” and “Bad Things,” he said, “she has quickly established herself as one of the most important young artists in pop music. “It always comes down to whether or not you have a song that resonates,” he added. “I know she spends a lot of time thinking about that.” In an under-lit, overpriced restaurant in Midtown Manhattan after her break in Miami had ended, Ms. Cabello, who has lately imagined herself as a vegan, provoked a kale salad while bopping along to Michael Jackson’s “The Way You Make Me Feel.” The song had been a highlight from a recent Christmas Eve karaoke night with her family (she was the only one who knew its final “Give it to me” pre-chorus), and she grieved for her cocoon. In 48 hours, she would perform before Mariah Carey at “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest” in a bejeweled, ankle-length coat and metallic jumpsuit that made her look like a glamorous conquistador. Then she had a tour to design, and music video concepts to finalize and a social media campaign to figure out. She started to explain why things were trickier now, how she no longer had anyone to pick up the slack. “Even when there’s a day off, there’s never really a day off, because there’s so many decisions to be made and you’re always rushing to make stuff,” she said, as Jackson ad-libbed in the background. The music kept making her lose her train of thought. Finally, after a few vain attempts to catch it, she gave in and stopped explaining herself and sang along.

DAVE PHILIPPS,"WASHINGTON — A mystery that went unsolved for 73 years began when Herman Mulligan threw a grenade. In the thick of some of the most vicious fighting of World War II, on the island of Okinawa, Private First Class Mulligan’s grenade clattered into the dark maw of a Japanese bunker and blew up a cache of ammunition. The huge explosion obliterated most of the hillside, and blasted the 21-year-old Marine beyond recognition. Amid the chaos, his unidentified body was buried in a hasty battlefield grave, while the Marine Corps listed Private Mulligan as missing in action. In the years after the war, he was reclassified as “unrecoverable,” and the family that knew him gradually died off, until his memory was almost as lost as his bones. The private’s story could have ended there, among the roughly 72,000 American troops from World War II who have not been accounted for. But the ending has been rewritten by a black-and-white snapshot found in a Marine veteran’s trunk. The photo inspired an informal network of volunteer sleuths to track down survivors of the battle, pore over forgotten maps and comb through yellowed files until they had traced Private Mulligan’s likely remains to a burial plot under a marble cross in Manila. Then they found a cousin, James Patterson, who could provide DNA for matching.",Digitized records and DNA tests are allowing civilian volunteers to pitch in and help put correct names on unidentified remains in American military cemeteries.,2018-04-17T13:32:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Lost in Battle, Found by Amateur Sleuths: An ‘Unknown’ Marine",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/us/marines-mystery-herman-mulligan.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/us/00mulligan-01/00mulligan-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1
Brian Heater,"Its not as if the internet needed another cautionary tale about backing up data, but for many artists, this news is heartbreaking nonetheless. MySpace has issued a tersely worded message noting that a huge amount of user uploaded music has been lost during a server migration.
The once dominant social network posted a note on its site reading, As a result of a server migration project, any photos, videos, and audio files you uploaded more than three years ago may no longer be available on or from MySpace. We apologize for the inconvenience.”
Users have been reporting issues with music uploaded between 2003 and 2015 for around a year now. Weve reached out to MySpace for additional insight into the issue and whether what could well be millions of tracks are indeed permanently lost in the digital ether. Honestly though, things dont look too good for MySpace or music uploaders.
I'm deeply skeptical this was an accident. Flagrant incompetence may be bad PR, but it still sounds better than ""we can't be bothered with the effort and cost of migrating and hosting 50 million old MP3s.""
— Andy Baio (@waxpancake) March 18, 2019
Some are understandably skeptical of the whole situation. Others are suggesting this be seen as a cautionary tale for those relying on more contemporary services to host their art. For many, however, its a huge segment of formative internet years seemingly wiped away like a sand castle in the tide. 
MySpace was, of course, a major internet presence in the mid-aughts. The company was purchased by NewsCorp for $580 million in 2005, becoming the most visited site in the States around the same time. Six years later, it was sold for a mere $35 million, having since been eclipsed by Facebook. 
In recent years, MySpace has attempted to pivot to a music-first site, with middling results. Nothing gold can stay, as the saying goes and for now, at least, that appears to include the volumes of music once hosted on its servers.","It’s not as if the internet needed another cautionary tale about backing up data, but for many artists, this news is heartbreaking nonetheless.

Ron Miller,"How much of your digital life would you lose if you lost a single password? Without it, you are locked out and the cold reality of using free cloud services like Google is that you don’t have a human arbiter to help you. If you think back to earlier times where, say you lost your bank book, your local banker probably knew who you were and could help you navigate the process of getting it replaced. When you lose your password, it’s not that simple — as I found out. Imagine you have spent much of your digital life for the last 12 years on Google. You rely on their, mail and calendar, Google Drive for storage and Google Photos for your photo archive. Then imagine that one day, you get locked out after forgetting your password. That’s what happened to me. Who are you? About a month ago, I went to sign into Google. I use different passwords all the time and I forgot which one I had used most recently for Google. I clicked ‘Forgot Password’ as I always had. I was asked to send a confirmation to my phone they had on file. I did that. I responded and was asked to send a confirmation code to my email. I did that and entered the code. I was asked to answer a security question. I answered it. At that point, you would think I had done more than enough to prove that I was who I said I was. I had supplied, not one, not two, but three factors of identification, but this was not enough for Google for some reason. I was asked to enter the most recent password I remembered. I did that. I was asked when I first opened my account. I have no idea to be honest and it’s kind of a weird security requirement because seriously, who is going to remember when they opened their Google account to the month if it was over a decade ago? It’s not information people typically keep. I got to the end of the process expecting to be asked for a new password. I was told I was locked out and I would have to make a request to Google to get in. I followed the procedure, waited for several days (a lifetime without access to my email, calendar, documents) and I was told I was rejected. I’m not sure how many ways you have to identify yourself to satisfy Google, but apparently all the ways I had supplied weren’t enough. There was nothing in the email about any recourse. I was simply locked out. No where to run to, baby I was at an impasse and not sure what to do, but use my contacts as a journalist. If I hadn’t been a journalist with such contacts, I’m not sure what I would have done, but I had them and I used them hoping to resolve this quickly. As it turned out, it would not be quick at all. On December 5th, I sent a note to a PR contact who I work with on Google-related news and I told him about my problem. He said he had gotten my case escalated and I should hear within 24 hours. Latest Crunch Report On Dec 7th after not hearing from Google, I contacted him again and he gave me this procedure to try, which was pretty much the same procedure I had tried before: Visit https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery Enter Username Click on “Try a different question” at every step until they reach the question “When did you create this Google Account?” Select approximate date when the account was created and click “Next” Enter any contact email address that they have access to and finish the whole verification process. Please ensure that regardless of whether the user knows the answer to the questions or not, they complete answering all the questions till the end. Completing the account recovery process, will create a case for us to work with. I dutifully did this and once again got a message that Google couldn’t verify the account. Five days later I still hadn’t heard anything, so on December 12th I contacted my PR friend again, who at this point had to be getting pretty tired of being my go-between. He did his thing and told me that the reset link was being sent to an alternative address of mine. I got an email from Google later in the day, which I shared with my PR contact: Hi there, Here at Google, we’re constantly trying to provide you the best customer support experience. You recently contacted our support team to regain access to your Google account. Since then, have you been able to successfully sign back into your account? The choices were Yes/No. I chose No and asked for a new reset command. The Reset command never came. Help me if you can I’m feeling down On December 13th I tried getting in touch with Google by Twitter, posting my case number and pleading for some help. None came. Hey @Google my case # is [7-4240000018376] I haven’t been able get into my Google account for a couple of weeks in spite of following the forgot password protocol, responding to a confirmation on my phone, at my email and answering security questions. I need this resolved. — Ron Miller (@ron_miller) December 13, 2017 That same day I opened a second GMail account so I could have access to services like an email account if need be, even if it didn’t have any of my previous data in there. Two days later on December 15th I still hadn’t received that reset command and it turned out I never would. I had a case number, yet it was like it didn’t exist. Three more days passed. On December 18th I contacted the poor beleaguered PR contact yet again and he wrote back. They wanted me to go through the process again except using my TechCrunch email instead of my other alternative. I pushed back that I already had an open case, but he suggested I do it and see it what happens. Reunited and it feels so good I started the process entered my Techcrunch email and was simply asked to enter a new password and I was back in. After all that, that was all it took. I was ecstatic to have my digital life back, but I’m still shocked at a) how easy it was to lose access and b) how little recourse there was to get it back. Once you have gone through the recovery protocol, what is a person supposed to do to get Google’s attention? They don’t have customer service, yet I’m paying for storage. They don’t have a reasonable system for navigating this kind of problem and they don’t have a sensible appeals process. It goes to show just how tenuous our hold on our digital lives really is. If you lose access and you have nobody to talk to, you are out in the cold with little or no possibility of getting any kind of reasonable help, especially without special contacts like I had because of my job. If so much of our lives depends on that single password, three factors of identification should surely be more than enough proof to get back in. The only thing I can suggest, and which I think I will do in the future, is to use a password manager and don’t leave it to chance. One day you could click “Forgot Password” and that could be the last time you access your Google account. Your digital life could be hanging by that thin thread called your password, and if you can’t remember it at some point, it’s like you don’t exist and you are cut off. Editor’s Note: We contacted Google for a comment about this, but hadn’t heard back by the time of publication. If we do, we will update the story.","How much of your digital life would you lose if you lost a single password?

ALAN RAPPEPORT,"WASHINGTON The five-week federal government shutdown cost the United States economy $11 billion, with nearly a quarter of that total permanently lost, the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday.
The nonpartisan C.B.O. said that the shutdown, which started in late December and ended last Friday, delayed $18 billion in spending by federal workers. That is expected to reduce 2018 fourth quarter gross domestic product by $3 billion and cut first quarter growth this year by $8 billion, or 0.2 percent.
The C.B.O. said that growth in subsequent quarters will be higher as that delayed spending takes place and filters through the economy. However, it estimates that $3 billion will never be recovered.
The most direct hit to the economy came from the loss of spending by furloughed workers, as well as the delay in federal spending on goods and services and reduced aggregate demand, C.B.O. said.",Most of lost growth is expected to be recovered in future quarters.,2019-01-28T15:45:51Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Shutdown Cost U.S. Economy $11 Billion, C.B.O.

MARGARET RENKL and DAMON WINTER,"In one way of looking at it, the bald eagles at Reelfoot Lake are returning the favor by providing a critical source of income for the region. Once a thriving community of farmers upward of 25,000 at midcentury, Mr. Douglas said it is now home to only 5,000 residents (and another 3,000 inmates at the Northwest Correctional Complex). The fertile land in the Mississippi flood plain is still farmed, but mechanization has replaced human labor. Across Lake County there are ghost churches at crossroads and the corners of fields; once the center of community life, theyve fallen into ruin, and the county has become one of the poorest in the United States.
Tourism is now its main source of income. Sportsmen keep the rental rooms filled during hunting and fishing seasons. Birders and naturalists arrive during the songbird migrations. And in winter eagle watchers show up from around the world to see a gorgeous bird, its talons extended, snatch a duck from a fallow rice field or sit quietly on a nest at the top of an immense cottonwood tree, its gleaming feathers rustling in the wind.
On our last morning at Reelfoot, our fellow guests at the Dragonfly Inn were speculating at breakfast about why so many people are fascinated by eagles. I think its because theyre so big, one woman said. So majestic. Another woman looked at a preacher who happened to be sitting at the head of the table. Its Isaiah, isnt it? she asked: But those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.

Wired Staff,"After weeks of unrelenting chaos, the cybersecurity world took a little bit of a breather. Well, relatively, anyway. There was still one of the biggest data breaches in recent memory, compliments of UnderArmour. The TKTKKTK. But hey, everyone makes mistakes, including the world’s most elite hackers—just ask the Russian intelligence agent behind the Guccifer 2.0 persona, whose failure to use a VPN just once outed him as GRU. Or ask people who used Monero in the early days and put too much faith in its privacy protections, which a new study says aren’t as robust as they seemed, especially before a recent update. Or even ask Facebook, which left a privacy setting active for years that didn’t actually do anything. Or the City of Atlanta, which is still dealing with the fallout of a ransomware attack from over a week ago. What a world! At least some people are getting it right, or trying to. Facebook detailed a few efforts to safeguard the election, although the social network still has a long way to go. And the trainees at Fort Gordon are learning how to fight the next generation of cyberwars. One thing they’ll need to be aware of? How jihadists are increasingly using steganography to send covert messages, through an unfortunately named app called MuslimCrypt. But, wait, there's more! As always, we’ve rounded up all the news we didn’t break or cover in depth this week. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. Ecuadorean Embassy Cuts Off Assange's Internet Ecuador may have granted Julian Assange asylum in its London embassy for the last six years. But it seems to be growing tired of granting him access to the Wifi. Earlier this week the embassy officially cut off his internet connection, saying that he had violated a written agreement with the Ecuadorean government that he would cease meddling in world affairs. That move followed Assange's repeated comments in his twitter feed in support of Spain's Catalan independence movement, including one tweet comparing the current Spanish government to Franco's 1940s fascist regime and the German government—which may extradite the leader of the Catalan separatist movement—to the Nazis. That may have seriously ruffled political feathers, given Ecuador's close relations with Spain. And another tweet from Assange casting doubt on Russia's involvement in the nerve gas attack on Russian defector Sergei Skripal may not have helped the matter. Of course, censoring Assange hasn't proven to be so easy. Ecuador previously cut his internet access ahead of the 2016 election, too, in response to WikiLeaks' publication of leaked emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and yet WikiLeaks' document dumps and tweets continued. Based solely on some telltale typos in WikiLeaks' recent tweets—Assange is a notorious misspeller—he may have at one point found a connection to the outside world in the days after his ban. Subsequent reports of radio jamming equipment in the embassy, however, may have complicated his censorship circumvention. Boeing Fights a WannaCry Infection—Maybe? Nearly a year has passed since the WannaCry ransomware worm ripped through the internet, encrypting hundreds of thousands of victim computers using a stolen NSA hacking technique. So when reports surfaced this week that Boeing was hit with that now-outdated malware, security researchers were left scratching their heads. Certainly Boeing was in fact struck with a serious ransomware attack based on a leaked memo that described its response as an ""all hands on deck"" situation. But WannaCry's spread was almost entirely ended in May of last year when British security researcher Marcus Hutchins registered a web domain that activated a ""kill switch"" in the worm's code. Just how—or whether—Boeing could still be infected by that largely neutered malware remains unknown. Some researchers have pointed out that if part of Boeing's network was cut off from the public internet, it could have prevented a WannaCry infection from reaching the kill switch domain and prevented the malware's shutdown. Or it's just as possible that reports have confused a more run-of-the-mill ransomware infection with a name-brand one that made headlines nearly a year ago.",,2018-03-31T13:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Security News This Week: Julian Assange Has Lost His Internet Privileges,https://www.wired.com/story/julian-assange-has-lost-his-internet-privileges/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5abeb981a54678516963cd24/191:100/pass/AssangeNoWifi-685308660.jpg,wired,Wired,lost,1
Reyna Grande,"Reyna Grande is the author of the memoirs ""The Distance Between Us"" and ""A Dream Called Home."" Born in Guerrero, Mexico, she came to the US as an undocumented child immigrant. The views expressed here are hers. View more opinion on CNN. 
 (CNN)It was only fitting that just three days after UNESCO celebrated International Mother Language Day, Spanish was spoken at the 91st Academy Awards.
""Ya se puede hablar español en los Oscars,"" Mexican actor Diego Luna said onstage. ""Ya nos abrieron la puerta y no nos vamos a ir."" We can speak Spanish at the Oscars now. They've opened the door to us and we aren't going anywhere...
It was empowering for me to hear the unapologetic use of my mother tongue at the Oscars -- not only from Luna but also from Javier Bardem and Alfonso Cuarón -- and it made me think about my childhood, when instead of pride, I was made to feel shame, when instead of a door being opened, an invisible wall was erected, when instead of being celebrated, my mother tongue was degraded. 
On my first day at a US school in September 1985, upon realizing that I didn't speak a word of English, my 5th-grade teacher pointed to the farthest corner of her classroom and sent me there. She ignored me for the rest of the year.
The message I received was that if I wanted to be seen and heard, I'd have to speak English. As I sat in that corner day after day, invisible, the trauma of realizing that I spoke the ""wrong"" language weighed on me and my head swam with debilitating thoughts: I am broken. I am wrong. I am not enough. 
Halfway through the year, my school held a writing competition requiring all the students to write a story. I wrote mine in the only language I knew. When my teacher collected the stories to choose the best ones for the competition, she tossed mine -- and those of the other non-English speakers -- into the reject pile. 
When I entered junior high school a few years later, I was placed in a transitional English as a Second Language (ESL) program. Its sole purpose was to make me English-proficient but not bilingual or biliterate. I was never encouraged to maintain and develop my mother tongue, only to learn English fast enough so that I could finally join mainstream classes -- and shed the stigma of being classified as an ""English Learner."" 
UNESCO defines a second language as ""a language acquired by a person in addition to [her] home language."" But at my junior high, because English was the only language I heard from my teachers, the objective seemed to be replacement, not addition.
Little by little, my Spanish was supplanted by English until I began to think and dream, and write only in that language. I didn't know then that a term existed to describe this phenomenon -- subtractive bilingualism, the act of subtracting the mother tongue and substituting English. In other words, the displacing of a fundamental part of ourselves: the unconscious initial expression of our humanity. 
In 8th grade, my junior high school held a writing competition similar to the one at my elementary school. I wrote a story in English this time and entered the competition, eager to be judged on the same terms as everyone else. To my surprise, I won first place. 
Although winning that competition would help me gain confidence in my writing skills, which later led to a career as a professional writer, it destroyed my relationship with Spanish. What I learned from that early experience was: If I write in Spanish, I will be rejected. If I write in English, I will be celebrated and win prizes. English, I concluded, was the only path to success in this country. 
The result is that for the past 30 years, whenever I have put pen to paper, the words that come out are in English, with only a sprinkling of Spanish for flavor. I have written best-selling books, essays, articles, op-eds, all in English. 
Our society has, in some ways, made great progress in how it approaches the education of children like I was, but we still have a long ways to go in eradicating our distrust and disdain for other languages.
Take for example the woman in West Virginia who last week verbally assaulted a manager at a Mexican restaurant for speaking Spanish and screamed, ""When you are in America you need to speak English!"" Or the Border Patrol agent in Montana who questioned two US born Latinas and asked for their IDs simply because he overheard them speaking Spanish. Or the situation at Duke University last month, when one of its medical school professors was asked to step down after she sent a warning to students to speak English only, or risk the ""unintended consequences when you choose to speak Chinese in the building."" 
What are the unintended consequences of being shamed or threatened into speaking English? When our relationship to our mother tongue is compromised, so, too, is our self-image and our most natural way of interacting with the world. 
As I grew up, the shame I felt about my mother tongue eventually drove a wedge between me and my own mother, who never learned English. 
Since my parents were divorced and my siblings and I lived with our father, we would sporadically visit our mother at her one-room studio in downtown Los Angeles near Skid Row, surrounded by homeless people, prostitutes and drug addicts.
When she'd first arrived in the US at 30, my mother worked at a garment factory trimming threads for 15 cents per garment. Later, she quit that job and became a vendor at the local swap meets selling Avon products and cheap plastic sandals. She supplemented her income by picking cans and bottles out of the trash and taking them to the recycling center. 
By then, my siblings and I had bought into the belief that to succeed in this country you had forfeit your cultural identity, so we would constantly encourage our mother to go to adult school and learn English. She would shake her head, dismayed by our suggestion. ""El inglés no se me pega."" English doesn't stick to me, she'd say.
As my siblings and I became English-proficient and finally, English-dominant, we began to reject our mother and everything she represented. To our Americanized eyes, she was a symbol of what we didn't want to be -- a working-class, uneducated, non-English-speaking immigrant. The more we were educated in US schools and the more we assimilated, the more we internalized the disdain American society has for someone like my mother. My siblings and I spoke English all the time, and as the years passed, we both consciously and unconsciously excluded our mother from all our conversations and eventually, from our middle-class American lives.
As an adult, I've come to realize how important bilingualism is in a diverse country such as ours, and yet, those formative experiences in school prevented me from teaching Spanish to my own children. The same was true for my sisters. On those rare times they'd see their grandmother, my children couldn't speak to her without the help of Google Translate.
Just like it had with me, the language barrier created a distance between my children and my mother.
My teenage son can't speak Spanish beyond level 1. My young daughter's Spanish was as limited as my son's, but a few years ago we moved to Davis, California, and to our surprise, the local elementary school offered a two-way Spanish immersion program even though the population is 55.4% white alone, not Hispanic or Latino and only 14% Latino.
I saw this as an opportunity to undo my mistake and requested for my daughter to be enrolled in the program. But, since she was entering halfway through second grade and not in kindergarten when students typically begin, she was given a placement test. She almost failed it. She couldn't speak in sentences and only knew individual words such as agua, abuela, mamá, papá. Luckily, they let her in anyway.
Six months later, I was invited to visit her classroom to see my daughter's final project: a 20-minute slideshow presentation about thorn bugs -- in Spanish. In six months, my daughter had become completely bilingual and able to read in both languages, with no loss to her native tongue, and better yet, no trauma.
When I took her to Mexico to visit my relatives over the holidays, she was so happy to be able to speak to everyone there, including her own grandmother, whom I had invited to join us on the trip as a way to reconnect. There we were -- my mother, my daughter, and I speaking Spanish together. ""Thank you, Mommy, for putting me in that program,"" my daughter said on the day we arrived. 
My daughter's experience with language learning has been the opposite of mine. Her teachers have never made her feel that she must sacrifice, subtract, replace or reject anything about herself. The most important lesson her bilingual program has taught her is this: She is now more, not less, than who she used to be.
It took me into my adulthood to realize the extent of the damage caused by my educational trauma wrought by institutions that shamed me into speaking only English. But I am slowly reclaiming what I'd been forced to give up -- my connection to my mother tongue and with it, my relationship with my own mother. 
I hope that among the millions of people watching the Academy Awards on Sunday night, there was a 5th-grade immigrant girl who heard her mother tongue being spoken at one of the most prestigious events in the country and realized that she is not invisible, not broken.
For my part, Diego Luna and his fellow artists have inspired me to one day do what I thought I could never do -- write a book in Spanish and rediscover what I once lost, one word at a time.","Reyna Grande came to the US from Mexico as a child and was made to feel invisible until she learned to speak English, an experience that so traumatized her that she gave up speaking Spanish, gradually losing the ability to communicate with her mother -- until…",2019-02-28T13:20:44Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",I lost my mother tongue -- and almost my mom,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/opinions/bilingualism-spanish-english-power-of-language-grande/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151123182508-reyna-grande-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,lost,1

 (CNN)There was no active war zone, no violent weather system, no kidnapping -- none of the dangers that humanitarian aid workers routinely experience around the world. And yet several tragically lost their lives on Sunday on an airplane that, ironically, is so technologically advanced it is billed as one of biggest success stories in modern aviation.
Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed Sunday with 157 passengers and crew aboard. The passengers on board the new Boeing 737 Max represented at least 35 nationalities.
The humanitarian aid industry, in particular, took a huge blow. According to the United Nations, there were 22 passengers associated with the world body on the flight. The World Food Program was the most severely hit UN agency, with seven of its staff on board, including Michael Ryan, its Irish-born global deputy chief engineer. Above and beyond that, various aid agencies -- from Save the Children and the Norwegian Refugee Council to Catholic Relief Services -- had staff aboard ET302.
Gone is an entire corps of experts and workers focused on issues as diverse as championing the cause of Arctic marine life to maintaining security in Uganda to easing the suffering of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. 
To put the loss further into perspective, the death toll dwarfs the number of UN staff lost in the bomb attack on the UN headquarters in Baghdad in 2003 and is just below the number of deaths in the car bomb attack on the UN building in Abuja in 2011 -- 22 and 21 respectively.
""It's devastating, it's heartbreaking,"" agency chief David Beasley told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""We lose people out on the field, the battlefield, natural disasters almost every single day. But we don't expect something like this.""
Among the victims was Jessica Hyba, one of 18 Canadians on board who worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as an external relations officer based in Mogadishu, Somalia. Described by a colleague as ""a humanitarian warrior,"" she had worked previously for Care Canada in the emergency response to the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004.
There was also Hong Kong native Victor Shangai Tsang who worked as a policy officer on sustainable development goals with the UN Environment Program. He was described as a ""champion of gender and the SDGs."" 
And Save the Children is mourning the loss of Tamirat Mulu Demessie, a child protection in emergencies technical adviser, who ""worked tirelessly to ensure that vulnerable children are safe during humanitarian crises.""
As CBC News anchor Adrienne Arsenault put it on Sunday, given the large number of aid workers aboard, ET302 was a ""planeload of potential.""
With almost a half million humanitarian aid workers worldwide, it is rare for a commercial flight to take off without one on its flight manifest. And when such a large number are lost in one go, especially in these circumstances, the pain and sense of loss is multiplied.
Even before the crash, the sector was facing a host of challenges -- ranging from significant funding gaps to global conflicts lasting longer and becoming more lethal. An increasingly complex world requires people with a host of skills and commitment.
When things do go wrong, a rare camaraderie exists among aid workers that's almost hard to describe. A typical UN career, for example in my case, can take you from one man-made and natural disaster to another, working with people from many nationalities in close quarters and under extremely challenging conditions: Our connective tissue tends to be very strong and remains that way for life. Many of our friendships have been forged in terrible circumstances -- wars, famines, cyclones, tsunamis, disease outbreaks and amid unspeakable attacks on innocent civilians. 
And with mental health problems rampant in the industry and with agencies doing little to address the problem, we tend to rely on each other years or even decades after our assignments or deployments are completed.
""The global community of aid workers is like the family you choose,"" my former UNICEF colleague Tanya Accone told me. ""We are knit together by our common experience of living a highly mobile vocation to international public service -- these are the people you celebrate your milestones with, who you depend on in a family emergency, who you sweat the big and small stuff with. Our network is much closer than seven degrees of separation, so when this sort of things happens it reverberates around the world and many of us are affected.""
When the past is prologue
Watching investigators walk through the debris in Ethiopia brought back some of the painful images I experienced while walking amid the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in Eastern Ukraine. There are similarities between the two crashes in the sense that relatives will likely face a painful process, as they wait to receive the remains of their loved ones. 
I was part of a team of international observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who arrived at the crash some 24 hours after it came down on July 17, 2014. Alongside the mangled bodies we found personal belongings ranging from plush toys and travel books to personal notes written aboard the aircraft.
Knowing that the impact of the fuel tanks created a fireball that reached up to 1,600 Celsius, melting the wings and vaporizing most everything around it, I knew that some relatives would not receive any remains whatsoever. That's why it is so important to preserve precious personal belongings that have survived the crash and repatriate them to loved ones.
In the case of ET302, it is important to preserve the work undertaken by the humanitarian aid workers who lost their lives. Those lost in the line of duty would want nothing more than for their work to continue -- especially in the quest to heal an increasingly fragile planet. We owe them nothing less.","There was no active war zone, no violent weather system, no kidnapping -- none of the dangers that humanitarian aid workers routinely experience around the world.

"Doug Criss, CNN","(CNN)Changing to a new antidepressant caused Ariel Winter to lose weight, the ""Modern Family"" actress said. 
It was several things Winter touched on on Tuesday during an Instagram Stories question-and-answer session.
""The change in medication instantly made me drop all of the weight I couldn't lose before by just giving me back a metabolism,"" Winter wrote in response to a submitted question. ""That was very unexpected.""
Winter, 21, said she had been on antidepressants for years and had learned to accept the weight gain that was a side effect of the medication. But she grew tired of the ""eh"" feeling associated with the drug, which she didn't name, so she started the search for something new.
""So I started the process again and was able to find a great combination of medication that works for me,"" she wrote.
Winter also answered questions about her mental health, saying that she was ""doing pretty good"" and that seeing a therapist was nothing to be ashamed of.
""I'm hoping the discussions will keep us progressing in the right direction with mental health check ups,"" she said.
She also raved about getting breast reduction surgery, giving it a 10 out of 10 recommendation and saying it feels nice now that her back doesn't hurt any more.
For years Winter has battled body shaming internet trolls. In 2015, she posted a swimsuit photo with two of her nieces that triggered a flood of lewd and disparaging comments.
Her response to that included a photo of the back of a woman's legs marked with labels about the meaning some people are inclined to read into the length of a woman's hem.
""The height of a girl's skirt or whatever she is wearing for that matter, does not imply what she is asking for. It sickens me to think at 17 years old, a photo of myself with my nieces is suggesting that I'm 'asking for it,' "" Winter wrote.
Overall, Winter sounded pleased with how things turned out after switching medications, but there is one thing she misses.
""While I feel better mentally with the change, and it's nice to work out and have your body actually respond, but I want to gain a few pounds of muscle and get healthier,"" she wrote. ""Also want my butt back.""

ROB ROGERS,"My personal turning point came in March, when management decided that my cartoons about the president were “too angry” and said I was “obsessed with Trump.” This about a president who has declared the free press one of the greatest threats to our country.

"Gregory Wallace, CNN","(CNN) NASA has lost priceless relics of space history, largely because of poor record keeping and follow-through, the agency's watchdog concluded. The inspector general recently found ""NASA does not have adequate processes in place to identify or manage its heritage assets."" That has led NASA to lose track of items that flew in space, such as ""an Apollo 11 lunar collection bag that contained lunar dust particles,"" and other historically significant items, like a prototype lunar rover that was sold to a scrap yard. NASA told the inspector general's office in a memo that it would develop better processes for dealing with historical items by the spring of May 2020. The agency did not immediately respond to CNN for comment. The rover turned up ""in a residential neighborhood in Alabama"" and was spotted by an Air Force historian. When contacted by the government, the owner ""expressed interest in returning the vehicle to NASA."" But the agency lost track of the vehicle because it did not follow through. ""After waiting more than 4 months for a decision from the Agency, the individual sold the rover to a scrap metal company,"" the inspector general found. ""NASA officials subsequently offered to buy the rover, but the scrap yard owner refused and, realizing its historical value, sold the vehicle at auction for an undisclosed sum."" In another instance, NASA lost track of a bag containing moon material, which was eventually sold for $1.8 million. The ""Apollo 11 lunar collection bag"" was ""seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation from the home of a former chief executive officer for the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center during a criminal investigation,"" the IG found, then sold at a Marshals Service auction. NASA learned of the bag in 2015 when the purchaser asked the agency to verify its authenticity, but a judge turned down NASA's request to take possession of the bag, and the unnamed individual auctioned it off. As the Space Shuttle program wound down, NASA improved its processes for keeping track of historical artifacts, the report said. But that has not helped the agency recover items dating to the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space missions of the 1960s and 1970s. Items from that era, the report said, have shown up in online auctions because ""NASA freely gave property as gifts to astronauts and other employees and contractors.""","NASA has lost priceless relics of space history, largely because of poor record keeping and follow-through, the agency's watchdog concluded.",2018-10-31T22:22:16Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Report: Priceless NASA artifacts lost because of poor record keeping,https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/31/politics/nasa-lost-artifacts/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181031174630-02-nasa-moon-buggies-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,lost,1
EILEEN SULLIVAN and PETER BAKER,"Stephen K. Bannon in Fairhope, Ala., last month. Credit Emily Kask for The New York Times WASHINGTON — President Trump essentially excommunicated his onetime chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon on Wednesday, dismissing him as an aide who had “very little to do with our historic victory” and has now “lost his mind.” In a written statement, Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. Bannon, who had made caustic comments about the president and his family to the author of a new tell-all book about the Trump White House. While Mr. Bannon had been pushed out of the White House last summer, he had remained in touch with Mr. Trump, but the two now appear to have reached a breaking point. “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency,” Mr. Trump said in the statement. “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.” Mr. Trump berated Mr. Bannon for the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama and said the former adviser did not represent him but is “only in it for himself.” “Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was,” Mr. Trump added. “It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.” In the book, Mr. Bannon describes a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower that Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign aides had with several Russians as “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” An early copy of the book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, by Michael Wolff, was obtained by The Guardian, which first reported Mr. Bannon’s jolting comments.","“Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency,” President Trump said in a statement. “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.”",2018-01-03T18:39:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump Says Bannon Has ‘Lost His Mind’ After Bannon Insults Donald Trump Jr.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-bannon.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/04/us/politics/04dc-trump/04dc-bannon-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1

Tony Stark is lost in space; Captain America, Black Widow, and Bruce Banner are left trying to figure out where everyone has gone; and Hawkeye is back — just not as we remember him. The trailers are purposely vague, and they only take footage from the first 20 minutes of Avengers: Endgame. That shouldn’t be too surprising considering how much of the film directors Joe and Anthony Russo are trying to keep under wraps. Avengers: Endgame is the culmination of the last decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe films, which began with Iron Man in 2008. That first generation of MCU films has spanned 22 movies, including Captain Marvel (out in March) and Avengers: Endgame.

James Vincent,"For years, scientists have been exploring how we can use signals from the brain to control prosthetic limbs. Usually, this work is focused on restoring motor function to people who have lost an arm or a leg, but new research from Japan shows how the same technology can also be used to augment existing human capabilities. Engineers from Kyoto’s Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute have demonstrated how people can be taught to control a third robotic arm with their brains, even using the limb to multitask. As described in a paper published in the journal Science Robotics today, eight of 15 test subjects were able to successfully balance a ball on a board with their hands, while grabbing a water bottle with a brain-controlled robot arm. It’s multitasking using a third robot arm, but movement is limited Although this may sound like something out of science fiction, it’s important to stress that the functionality of this third arm is extremely basic. The prosthetic moved along a predetermined path and performed only a single gesture: closing and opening its hand. Similarly, the brain-machine interface used to control the arm is not some magical mind-reading device. It’s a cap fitted with electrodes that measure electrical signals produced by the brain. In this case, participants were asked to imagine opening and closing the robot hand. The scientists recorded this signal, and turned it into an instruction for the robot arm. “What we’re measuring is leakage from the brain’s electrical activity,” Shuichi Nishio, one of the researchers involved in the study, tells The Verge. “We have to tune [the brain-machine interface] for each participant; selecting the right electrodes and frequencies.” Even with these limitations, though, it is very interesting work. As Nishio and his colleague Christian Peñaloza point out in their paper, it seems to be the first time supernumerary limbs have been controlled using the human brain. Usually such prosthetics are operated using joysticks or, if connected directly to the human body, electrical signals from muscles. Credit: ATR Footage from the tests. A full video can be seen here. Past research in this area gives some clue as to how extra limbs might be used if they became common in the future. This concept device from MIT, for example, gives users two extra robotic “arms” that are worn as a backpack. The creators thought these arms could be useful in manufacturing; helping to hold tools and parts, or bracing a worker’s body if they’re squatting in one place for an extended period of time. If such robot arms could also be controlled by the brain, they could become a seamless extension of the body. For Nishio and Peñaloza, supernumerary limbs might augment more than just our physical capability — they might improve our brains, too. In their paper, the pair noted that during the multitasking challenge, participants’ performance split into two distinct groups: those who were good and those were bad, with hardly anyone in the middle. This was in contrast to performance when individuals were asked just to control the robot limb by itself. In this single-task challenge, all participants did about the same, performing pretty well. This difference, say Nishio and Peñaloza, suggests some people are just better at multitasking than others. And if that’s the case, then maybe multitasking is a skill that could be improved by using these sorts of brain-controlled devices. “By operating this brain-machine interface, we have an idea that we may be able to train the brain itself,” says Nishio. This has yet to be proven, but the pair hope to work on the idea in future tests. After all, if you can learn to control three arms, then surely controlling two is child’s play.","Brain-controlled robot prosthetics are usually used to restore lost motor function.

Jacob Kastrenakes,"Twitter’s monthly user count has fallen for three quarters in a row, so to address the issue, Twitter has decided to stop announcing how many users it keeps losing. The change was announced in Twitter’s latest earnings release, where the company disclosed that it had lost another 5 million monthly users during the final few months of 2018. That brings Twitter to 321 million monthly users, down from 326 million the prior quarter. It’s Twitter’s lowest user figure in two years. Twitter will now disclose how many daily users it has, but says it shouldn’t be compared to other networks The change prevents Twitter from being directly compared to other social networks, some of which are growing far faster in their monthly user count. Facebook, for instance, added 49 million users last quarter. It also hides a number that hadn’t been looking good for Twitter for a while. Even before the figure started declining, Twitter’s monthly user count had only seen creeping gains in the prior couple years. In place of monthly users, Twitter will now disclose how many daily users it has — a figure that, at least from this initial disclosure, is at least slightly rosier. Twitter now has 126 million daily users, up from 115 million one year ago. Similar to monthly users, growth is slow in the US, with about 10 million users in that jump coming from other countries. Other companies disclose their daily user count, but Twitter has put put a small twist on its own metric: it’s referring to them as mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. This figure only counts people who use Twitter’s website or app to access the service on a daily basis. Twitter seems to be indicating that other companies do not distinguish between daily users who can and cannot be monetized. That said, it’s not entirely clear that other daily user counts are not largely, if not exclusively, composed of monetizable users since most other services don’t have the wide range of integrations and third party apps that Twitter does. ""Monetizable DAUs"" -- the worst internet metric by far -- are 126 million. Twitter says this is not comparable to other companies' DAU numbers so I won't say that Snapchat has 186 million DAUs — Shira Ovide (@ShiraOvide) February 7, 2019 Snapchat this week reported having 186 million daily users. Instagram announced having more than 500 million daily users over a year ago. So while the daily user figure does look better for Twitter, it isn’t exactly a sign of runaway success. It’s smaller than competitors’ daily user counts, and its growth rate has declined or stalled in three out of the last four quarters. The monthly user decline is largely of the company’s own doing, Twitter has suggested in recent quarters. Twitter started losing users in the spring after cracking down on bots and spam. It also dropped SMS deals with carriers that covered the cost of receiving tweets via text, reducing the number of people who are likely to use the app without a smartphone. This quarter, the company once again says user count was hurt by “by ongoing health efforts,” how resources were prioritized, and a further removal of spammy and suspicious accounts. There’s an extent to which Twitter’s user count is really just being brought in line with reality here. If Twitter is primarily losing bots and spam, and even low-engagement text message users, this latest (and final) monthly user count may now better reflect how many real people are actually using Twitter than the count did at the start of last year. Getting rid of bad accounts is ultimately a positive for Twitter. It means the platform is filled with more real users, and if it cuts down on bots spamming divisive or otherwise problematic content, it should make Twitter as a whole more welcoming to users. Still, it’s not the direction any company wants to see its user numbers headed. Twitter is down a total of 15 million monthly users since the figure started declining last year None of which paints the strongest picture of Twitter, at least in the short term. The company has long known that it ought to address widespread issues on the platform, like harassment, to improve the experience for users. It’s started to take action, but the changes have been small. And as a product, Twitter has iterated at a glacial pace, slowly testing out minor new features to boost engagement. Twitter says it’s seen a 16 percent decline in abuse reports from the same quarter a year ago, and that its enforcement measures have been three times as effective. This year, Twitter says its goal is to “take a more proactive approach to reducing abuse” on the site. The company also plans to keep improving its sign up process so that it’s harder for people — presumably people who have been banned before — to sign up again. Twitter also turned a profit again this quarter, for the fifth quarter in a row — and the fifth quarter ever. Investors aren’t pleased though, as Twitter’s projected earnings for next quarter aren’t as high as they’d hoped.

NICHOLAS FANDOS,"“What, in effect, those people are saying is that the military service of our staff and our members and our ideas mean less than theirs simply because we don’t have a congressional charter and we don’t wear hats,” he said. The relative newcomers to the world of veterans policy see in the debate an opportunity to advance their campaign against government-provided medical care. Together, they have pledged millions of dollars for advertising and outreach, and have unleashed a small army of lobbyists and donors to pressure the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers. Their efforts come as lawmakers on Capitol Hill are crafting legislation that could drastically reshape the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veterans Health Administration, a multibillion-dollar health system that provides care to nearly nine million veterans each year. They are hoping to complete their work before the end of the year, when a key agency program is set to run out of money. With Republicans in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, the Koch-funded efforts have already succeeded in disrupting the consensus-driven veterans community, where policy discussions have long been dominated by congressionally chartered veterans groups. Those groups still have significant clout with lawmakers, and in many cases they have largely banded together to critique the Koch-driven proposal, which they fear would effectively dismantle the agency they have built up over decades. At least one left-leaning veterans advocacy group, VoteVets, has also joined them, pledging to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to oppose privatization. Representative Phil Roe, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said he was committed to moving bipartisan legislation and would engage with “all stakeholders with serious ideas.” But Representative Tim Walz of Minnesota, the committee’s top Democrat, said Concerned Veterans for America should not be underestimated, particularly with its links to the White House and with other well-connected conservative groups waiting for a chance to take on a relatively popular government health care program. “I don’t underestimate the Kochs one bit. It is brilliant what they are trying to do,” Mr. Walz said. “They are as close to this White House and to the secretary as anyone.” Founded in 2012 with money from the Koch brothers and other conservative donors, Concerned Veterans for America first rose to prominence within the veterans community around a 2014 scandal over the manipulation of patient wait times at Department of Veterans Affairs facilities. In the aftermath, the group emerged as a vocal — and aggressive — critic of the agency. It advocated the creation of the so-called Veterans Choice program, which requires the agency to pay for veterans facing barriers to care within its own health system to get outside help. “This has been a yearslong sustained campaign to reform and fix the V.A.,” Mr. Caldwell said. “We’ve really strongly advocated for three core reforms: accountability, making it easier to fire and discipline bad employees; choice, giving veterans more control over their health care; and transparency, making the V.A. share more information with the public in terms of how it’s performing.” Now, Concerned Veterans wants legislators to go further, giving veterans the last say over where to use the health benefits they earn for years of service. It is also better positioned. President Trump has spoken favorably of letting veterans choose. The group’s former executive director was considered to be Veterans Affairs secretary. Another senior adviser was given a top position there before moving over to the White House. And Marc Short, the White House’s legislative director, is a former top Koch lieutenant. The latest push was a natural fit to activate other Koch groups, including Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners, according to a representative of the network, who asked for anonymity to discuss the group’s plans. The network plans to spend liberally from its $300 million to $400 million policy and politics budget for the year, financing outreach to activists, lobbying and direct advertising. Other allied groups, including Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform and Tea Party Nation, have come along, signing a letter to lawmakers late last month amplifying many of Concerned Veterans’ long-running arguments. That campaign has disturbed many of the old-line veterans groups, which argue that their privileged place in advising lawmakers is protected for a reason. Concerned Veterans and other advocacy groups working alongside it take directions from wealthy donors, they say, not veterans. The old-line veterans groups and lawmakers from both parties supported the creation of the Choice program and largely agree that the agency’s health programs need reorganization. The House committee was set to vote on bipartisan legislation on Wednesday that would allow agency doctors to decide with the veteran when it was in a veteran’s best interest to seek private care — because a nearby government facility either was overburdened or could not provide specialty care. The vote was ultimately postponed over cost concerns. Republicans and conservative groups would prefer new spending be at least partly offset by cost savings and other cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Democrats and the old-line veterans groups say they are unlikely to support a plan unless it makes simultaneous investments in the agency’s own capacity. Without it, they argue, the problems that have necessitated private care in the first place will only fester. “This is starve the beast to the point that it can’t function situation,” Mr. Walz said of the latter plan, “because if you don’t do this, the complaints against the V.A. are going to increase exponentially. The wait lists are going to increase. And then they are going to say, ‘See, we need more outside care.’” Mr. Caldwell said the House bill did not go far enough. The government, he argued, would still have too much control of veterans’ health choices. His group and its allies will keep fighting for a more ambitious reshaping of Veterans Affairs.

Jonathan Shieber,"Over the last five days, Tesla shareholders have watched the value of their stock decline by roughly 16% and seen nearly $8 billion in value erased, as the company’s celebrity chief executive, Elon Musk, has what amounts to a very public breakdown. However, Musk is not the only person responsible for the collapse of Tesla’s stock price. As The New York Times article which precipitated the latest slide in Tesla’s value on the public markets makes clear, the company’s board is also to blame. For months, Musk has been showing signs of strain (generously speaking), and has been accused of making questionable decisions to drive growth and stifle criticism or dissent at the revolutionary electric vehicle company he founded. During that time, as Shira Ovide notes in her piece from Bloomberg, Tesla’s board (primarily composed of Musk’s friends, relatives, and initial investors) took no public steps to control or manage the situation. Privately and on background the board (or certain members) expressed concern over Musk’s recent behavior, drug use (both medicinal and recreational) and Twitter habits. Those concerns should have been aired at the board level and the company’s directors should have exercised their ability to manage the mercurial Musk as his public actions became increasingly unmoored. Something could have happened after the disastrous earnings call with analysts. It could have happened around the time of the strange active shooter allegations that were made against a Tesla whistleblower. It could have happened after Musk called a diver involved in the rescue of trapped and starving children a “pedo”. At any of those moments the board could have stepped in and demanded that Musk face the consequences for actions that cost his company billions of dollars. They did not, and now Tesla’s position is more precarious than ever. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Musk for his public statements around privatization plans for Tesla that may or may not have been real. It’s another distraction for the company’s chief executive at a time when he is already under tremendous pressure to meet production targets for the company’s troubled Model 3 rollout ( even as it begins to hit its targets ). The problem is that Musk’s cult of personality is so intertwined with Tesla’s corporate identity, there’s a fear that as Musk goes so goes Tesla. That’s no way to run a business and it’s no way to ensure long term value for shareholders (either as a public or private company). Ultimately the board at Tesla needs to step in and take a more active role in overseeing the company, before the next decision they find themselves confronted with is the company’s liquidation.","Over the last five days, Tesla shareholders have watched the value of their stock decline by roughly 16% and seen nearly $8 billion in value erased, as the company’s celebrity chief executive, Elon Musk, has what amounts to a very public breakdown.

Zack Whittaker,"A lot can change in a year. Not when you’re Equifax. The credit rating giant, one of the largest in the world, was trusted with some of the most sensitive data used by banks and financiers to determine who can be lent money. But the company failed to patch a web server it knew was vulnerable for months, which let hackers crash the servers and steal data on 147 million consumers. Names, addresses, Social Security numbers and more — and millions more driver license and credit card numbers were stolen in the breach. Millions of British and Canadian nationals were also affected, sparking a global response to the breach. It was “one of the most egregious examples of corporate malfeasance since Enron,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer at the time. Yet, a year on from following the devastating hack that left the company reeling from a breach of almost every American adult, the company has faced little to no action or repercussions. In the aftermath, the company’s response to the breach was chaotic, sending consumers scrambling to learn if they were affected but were instead led into a broken site that was vulnerable to hacking. And when consumers were looking for answers, Equifax’s own Twitter account sent concerned users to a site that easily could have been a phishing page had it not been for a good samaritan. Yet, the company went unpunished. In the end, Equifax was in law as much a victim as the 147 million Americans. “There was a failure of the company, but also of lawmakers,” said Mark Warner, a Democratic senator, in a call with TechCrunch. Warner, who serves Virginia, was one of the first lawmakers to file new legislation after the breach. Alongside his Democratic colleague, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the two senators said their bill, if passed, would hold credit agencies accountable for data breaches. “With Equifax, they knew for months before they reported, so at what point is that violating securities laws by not having that notice?,” said Warner. “There was a failure of the company, but also of lawmakers.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) “The message sent to the market is ‘if you can endure some media blowback, you can get through this without serious long-term ramifications’, and that’s totally unacceptable,” he said. Lawmakers held hearings and grilled the company’s former chief executive, Richard Smith, who retired with his full $90 million retirement package, adding insult to injury. Equifax further shuffled its executive suite, including the hiring of a new chief information security officer Jamil Farshchi and former lawyer turned “chief transformation officer” Julia Houston to oversee “the company’s response to the cybersecurity incident.” Equifax declined to make either executive available for interview or comment when reached by TechCrunch, but Equifax spokesperson Wyatt Jefferies said protecting customer data is the company’s “top priority.” But there’s not much to show for it beyond superficial gestures of free credit monitoring — provided by Equifax, no less — and a credit locking app which, unsurprisingly, had its own flaws. In the year since, the company has spent more than $240 million — some $50 million was covered by cyber-insurance. That’s a drop in the ocean to more than $3 billion in revenue in the year since, according to quarterly earnings filings — or more than $500 million in profits. And although Equifax’s stock price initially collapsed in the weeks following, the price bounced back. Financially, the company looks almost as healthy as it’s ever been. But that may change. Former Equifax chief executive Richard Smith prepares to testify before the lawmakers. Smith later retired after hackers broke into the credit reporting agency and made off with the personal information of nearly 145 million Americans. Earlier this year, the company asked a federal judge to reject claims from dozens of banks and credit unions for costs taken to prevent fraud following the data breach. The claims, if accepted, could force Equifax to shell out tens of millions of dollars — perhaps more. The hundreds of class action suits filed to date have yet to hit the courts, but historically even the largest class action cases have resulted in single dollar amounts for the individuals affected. And when the credit agent giant isn’t fighting the courts, federal regulators have shown little interest in pursuit of legal action. An investigation launched by a former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, responsible for protecting consumers from fraud, sputtered after the new director reportedly declined to pursue the company. And, although the company is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for the second time this decade, fines are likely to be limited — if levied at all. Warren sent a letter Thursday to the heads of both agencies lamenting their lack of action. “Companies like Equifax do not ask the American people before they collect their most sensitive information,” said Warren. “This information can determine their ability to access credit, obtain a job, secure a home loan, purchase a car, and make dozens of other transactions that are critical to their personal financial security.” “The American people deserve an update on your investigations,” she said. To date, only the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought charges — not for the breach itself, but against three former staffers for allegedly insider trading. Escaping any local action, Equifax agreed with eight states, including New York and California, to take further cybersecurity steps and measures to prevent another breach, escaping any fines or financial penalties. “The American people deserve an update on your investigations” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Warner blamed much of the inaction to the patchwork of data breach laws that vary by state. “We’ve got different laws and you don’t have any standard, and part of the challenge around the data breach is that every industry wants to be exempted,” said Warner. It’s not a partisan issue, he said, but one where every industry — from telecoms to retail — wants to be exempt from the law. “If we really want to improve our business cyber-hygiene, you have got to have consequences for failing to keep up those cyber-hygiene standards,” he said. It’s a tough sell to posit Equifax, which fluffed almost every step of the breach process, before and after its disclosure, as a victim. While the millions affected can take solace in the beating Equifax got in the press, those demanding regulatory action might be in for a disappointingly long wait.","A lot can change in a year.

PAUL KRUGMAN,"The resistance continued with the town hall crowds that confronted Republican legislators as they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And in case anyone wondered whether the vocal anti-Trump crowds and Trump’s hugely negative polling would translate into political action, a string of special elections — capped by a giant Democratic wave in Virginia and a stunning upset in Alabama — has put such doubts to rest. Let’s be clear: America as we know it is still in mortal danger. Republicans still control all the levers of federal power, and never in the course of our nation’s history have we been ruled by people less trustworthy. This obviously goes for Trump himself, who is clearly a dictator wannabe, with no respect whatsoever for democratic norms. But it also goes for Republicans in Congress, who have demonstrated again and again that they will do nothing to limit his actions. They have backed him up as he uses his office to enrich himself and his cronies, as he foments racial hatred, as he attempts a slow-motion purge of the Justice Department and the F.B.I. In fact, there has been a strange dynamic over the past few months: The worse things look for Trump, the more closely Republicans tie themselves to him. One might have expected recent electoral defeats to give G.O.P. moderates a bit more backbone. Instead, senators like John McCain and Susan Collins, who won widespread praise for standing up against Obamacare repeal during the summer, went along meekly with a monstrously awful tax bill. And the growing evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia doesn’t seem to have induced any prominent Republicans who weren’t already anti-Trump to take a stand. Instead, we’ve seen erstwhile critics like Lindsey Graham become obsequious toadies promoting Trump properties. So we can’t count on the consciences of Republicans to protect us. In particular, we need to be realistic about the likely results of Robert Mueller’s investigation. The best bet is that no matter what Mueller finds, no matter how damning and no matter what Trump does — even if it involves blatant obstruction of justice — Republican majorities in Congress will back up their president and continue to sing his praises. In other words, as long as Republicans control Congress, constitutional checks and balances are effectively a dead letter. So it’s going to be up to the American people. They may once again have to make themselves heard in the streets. They’ll certainly have to make their weight felt at the ballot box. It’s going to be hard, because the game is definitely rigged. Remember, Trump lost the popular vote but ended up in the White House anyway, and the midterm elections will be anything but fair. Gerrymandering and the concentration of Democratic-leaning voters in urban districts have created a situation in which Democrats could win a large majority of votes yet still fail to take the House of Representatives. And even if voters rise up effectively against the awful people currently in power, we’ll be a long way from restoring basic American values. Our democracy needs two decent parties, and at this point the G.O.P. seems to be irretrievably corrupt. Even at best, in other words, it’s going to take a long struggle to turn ourselves back into the nation we were supposed to be. Yet I am, as I said, far more hopeful than I was a year ago. America is not yet lost.

The game officially kicks off at 6:30 pm ET on Sunday, February 3rd in Atlanta and will be televised by CBS. If you have a television, the best and easiest way to watch is to simply tune in. CBS is free to watch without a cable subscription, although depending on your TV you might need to snag a digital antenna in order to tune in over-the-air.
If you dont have a television, you still have options:
CBS Online
CBS says its offering the Super Bowl for free on CBSSports.com as well as the CBS Sports app, which is available on most connected devices. Youll also be able to tune in via the CBS All Access app. CBS All Access requires a subscription but offers a one-week trial you can use to catch the game.
Locast
The New York Timeswrote about Locasta streaming service that allows users to watch broadcast television for free. The not-for-profit service is essentially using an antenna to grab over-the-air signals (just like that digital antenna you have does) and then it streams that content online.
For now, its only available in nine cities: Denver, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Washington D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. If you dont have a television and live in one of those places then its a potentially a good option for catching the game as well as other over-the-air content.
Hulu with Live TV, PlayStation Vue, YouTube TV, FuboTV
Hulu with Live TV, PlayStation Vue, YouTube TV, and FuboTV all offer CBS. Your cheapest option of the bunch is FuboTV, which is $35/mo for the first month and $45/mo thereafter. Hulu with Live TV and YouTube TV, and DirecTV Now are all$40/month, and PlayStation Vue $45 a month.
All four offer free trial options, so if you havent tried them before then you can catch the game for free with a free trial just remember to cancel it before that trial is up or youll be on the hook for the whole month.
And remember if youre a Sling TV user you dont have access to CBS, so youll need to make other arrangements before kickoff.","On Sunday, the Los Angeles Rams will take on the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII.

MySpaceyes, its still aroundlost all the music uploaded to the site between these years thanks to some corrupted data during a server migration. Whoops.
And while the news probably doesnt put a dent in most peoples days, since those musically inclined have long since moved on to other social networks and services (like SoundCloud), all hope is not lost. Thanks to an anonymous academic study, a total of 490,000 MP3s previously living on MySpace between 2008 and 2010 have been recovered. You can now find this archive, dubbed the The Myspace Dragon Hoard, over at archive.org.
There are a few caveats to this mega-collection, however. First off, its hugea whopping 1.3 terabytes, split into 144 separate .ZIP archives. While a handy .TSV file (short for Table-Separate Values) can help you figure out whats in the entire collection, theres no easy way to grab a single archive that contains a smattering of songs you want.
If youre looking to dump said archive to your desktop or laptop, I recommend using a tool like JDownloader to queue and download all the .ZIP files. Also, you probably dont want to do this on wifi, nor at your local Starbucks (or other favorite hotspot). Stick to a wired connection, and heres hoping your ISP doesnt have any annoying data caps.
Otherwise, you can search for individual songs and stream them directly from archive.org. Just use the Hobbit tool created for this archive, which gives you a MySpace-like player and search abilities directly in your browser. The tool might take a bit of time to load the index for the massive MP3 collection, but it workscrudely. You cant use this player to browse, only search, so prepare to spend some time querying for your favorite, obscure bands. 
However, the tool does let you download individual tracks, which is probably all youll really use this MySpace collection for anyway. After all, the saved files only represent a tiny fraction of the millions of lost musical tracks that are now but fragments in the great digital ether.","Last month, I felt a disturbance in the Force, as if millions of crappy songs from 2003 to 2015 cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.

In an effort to preserve internet content, the Internet Archives and ArchiveTeam create digital backups of websites and other internet content that would otherwise be lost to time, and their next project is the preservation of Google+.
A recent Reddit post details both groups plans to save publicly posted material on Google+, as well as details on how volunteers can help.
For some this may be good newssure, the general consensus is that Google+s demise is overdue, but a small, dedicated user base has persisted until the bitter end. For them, the archival work ensures that the legacy of their favorite social network will live on.
For others, news that Google+ content will be sticking around may not be as welcome, especially if you assumed old Google+ posts you dont want to be remembered would quietly disappear when the service is shuttered next month.
While the team working to preserve Google+s content cant save everythingprivate or previously deleted posts cant be accessed, posts with over 500 comments will only be preserved in truncated form, and publicly shared images will be saved at lower resolutionsthe process of archiving public Google+ posts has already begun, so youll need to act quickly. Heres how to make sure any public Google+ posts dont get archived, and how to get rid of them if they are.
How to prevent Google+ posts from being archived
The best way to ensure your public Google+ content is gone entirely is to delete your account.
Sign into the Google Account linked to the Google+ profile you want to delete
Open Google+ (you can also do this with the apps widget or by clicking your Google profile image then clicking Google+ Profile while on any Google web app or page such as Google Drive, YouTube, etc.)
From the Google+ page, click Settings from the menu on the left
Scroll down to the very bottom and click Delete Google+ Profile
Youll be asked to input your Google account password
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the profile deletion
Deleting your Google+ profile willnot delete your Google account, YouTube account/channels, or affect any other Google services. It will only remove your Google+ account.
That said, if you would rather not delete your Google+ account entirely, you can instead try to delete any public posts/information before The Internet Archives and ArchiveTeam get to it. 
To delete a post, you must be signed into your Google+ account, then on the post(s) you wish to delete, click the three stacked dots more icon and click Delete. You can make changes to your profile information by clicking Edit Profile from your profile page.
Fair warning: Its not guaranteed that either of the above steps will prevent your public posts from being archived, since its possible the archival teams algorithms may have gotten to them before you did, and your profile will be archived if you dont delete it entirely. If thats the case, you can still get those removed:
Search for your Google+ profiles URL using the Internet Archives Wayback Machine to see if any of your old posts are available. You can also do the same for a specific posts URL as well.
If anything you wish to be removed has made its way onto the Internet Archives database, you can use the page removal request form to request the content be taken down.","Google+ gets the axe on April 2, but some of your old posts may be sticking around—whether you want them to or not.

But what exactly do I do with pillows that have lost their cushioning or that old, ripped comforter thats gathered dust in my closet?
Both pillows and comforters are considered household textiles, like curtains, drapes, or rugs. You typically cant recycle these through your curbside recycling program (though, you can consult your own program by doing an online search to be sure).
When it comes to recycling, we all make mistakes.

If youre interested in recycling a comforter to be made into new products like carpet padding, you can search for linen recycling using Earth911's locator, or search for a nearby textile recycling facility online. Pillows, however, generally arent as easy to recycle. You may be able to find a facility that accepts foam pillows using the locator, but for hygienic reasons, you cant donate them to most secondhand stores. (Still, giving them away is a viable option if you want to list them on sites like FreeCycle or even Craigslist.)
But if you want to save a little time and even help some dogs and cats in the process, you should contact your local animal shelter and ask if you can drop off your used bedding. Why? Shelters will often accept your spare comforters or pillows as bedding for animals. Its a perfect trade-off and you can help animals feel a little more comfortable in unknown settings.

If youre interested, here are some helpful tips from one Reddit thread on the subject:
Wash them before you donate them.
Avoid donating any bedding with holes.
Avoid donating any torn bedding, with strings and stuffing hanging out.
If you can, cutting up a large comforter into smaller comforters (likely, so more animals can benefit from your donation). 
And, because it needs re-iterating, check with your shelter to make sure they accept your donated bedding before you make the drop-off. As Redditor u/KimKimMRW mentioned, you dont want to inundate a shelter with any unneeded product. The need for comforters and pillows varies from shelter to shelter depending on demand, so a quick call can save both of you time.

Dami Lee,"I thought hanging out with a Scrabble-playing robot would be a nice, chill time. I even imagined they would be useful at nursing homes, as therapy companions to elderly residents. I was extremely wrong. Scrabble bot’s official name is actually the Intelligent Vision System for Companion Robots, made by Taiwanese research company ITRI (Industrial Technology Research Institute). It uses a combination of AI, 3D vision, and hand-eye coordination to pour its opponent a cup of coffee, and then mercilessly crush them at Scrabble. The AI determines which combination of letter tiles can create the highest scoring word, and tallies up the opponents score accurately as well. But it’s not really all that fun playing against a robot that’s programmed to maximize its wins, and also has the power of an entire dictionary by its side. It doesn’t adjust its playing level to match its opponent either; its expressionless face stands silent, judging, as it shows no mercy. ITRI The robot follows the official Scrabble dictionary, so it wouldn’t recognize my excellently-played “zen” as a word. (The 10-point “Z” was on the triple letter score!) But alas, “zen” is disqualified because it’s a a proper noun, as a specific branch of Buddhism. The robot is strategy centered on going straight for the most obscure words, such as “aquae”, and trying to hit multiple words in one turn. Unsurprisingly, our match ended with my devastating loss. Scrabble breaks up most friendships anyway, so seeing as my opponent was a robot with unlimited access to a dictionary, I probably won’t be playing with it again.

David Murphy,"Now that the second season of Westworld is over, freezing motor functions on a delightful, but somewhat-confusing series for the next year or two, you might feel a bit lost about what you should do next. Find another show to binge? Re-read even more fan theories? Start writing out a delightful old-timey piano cover of your favorite 1990s alt-rock song? Don’t worry; you can still get one more hit of Westworld before the long wait begins. And I’m not talking about that terrible mobile game that Bethesda is trying to sue into oblivion —good riddance. If you have an Amazon Echo device, check out the skill Westworld: The Maze. While it might not allow you to fulfill every one of your secret fantasies in a murder-filled version of Disney’s Frontierland, it’s a clever little choose-your-own-adventure trip that’s packed with “two hours of unique gameplay,” as its description reads. (You’ll probably be able to finish it in around 20–30 minutes, if you know your Westworld lore and make reasonable choices.) If you don’t have an Echo, you won’t be left out of the loop—er, maze. Download the Amazon app for iOS or Android and pull it up. Tap on the icon in the upper-right corner that looks like a small solar eclipse, but is actually a tiny speech bubble in the center of a white circle. When prompted, say, “Alexa, open Westworld: The Maze.” Agree that you can listen to adult things, and the game will fire up. As for the experience itself, make sure you’re paying attention to everything you’re told. You’ll have to make it through three “levels” to reach “the maze,” answering plenty of questions along the way. I was snarky in my first attempt and managed to get myself booted out of the game after two questions. What can I say; I like to test the limits.","Now that the second season of Westworld is over, freezing motor functions on a delightful, but somewhat-confusing series for the next year or two, you might feel a bit lost about what you should do next.

MICHAEL WILSON,"“At first, she brought a lot of joy into my life,” Ms. Haskell said. But she also took. The women had visited Ms. Haskell’s HSBC Bank branch on Ralph several times, and Ms. Legall had access to Ms. Haskell’s account information. At some point several years ago, she told Ms. Haskell that she had taken money that had been in a savings account that had belonged to Mr. Haskell. She needed it to pay a debt, she said. “It sounded like maybe she’d give it back to me,” Ms. Haskell said. “I was so naïve.” The incident had no impact on their bond. “I’m still ‘Mommy,’” Ms. Haskell said. “I saw her a lot.” The two visited nearby restaurants and took selfies that Ms. Legall posted online. In 2013, Ms. Haskell’s last surviving sister, Marcy, died in Florida. Ms. Legall traveled with her for the funeral. “She helped me on the airplane,” Ms. Haskell recalled. “It was like a little vacation for her.” Four more years passed this way. Then Ms. Haskell’s son, Lloyd, a physician, received a certified letter that stunned him. A bank was going to foreclose on his mother’s home because she was not paying fees related to a reverse mortgage for $424,000. Reverse mortgage? His mother lived comfortably within her means. She didn’t travel or buy expensive clothes. A splurge for her was adding to her extensive collection of dolls. What did she need $400,000 for? He asked her. She said she had taken out the money for Ms. Legall, who needed it to pay another debt. Mr. Haskell, mad at himself for believing Ms. Legall was looking after his mother, went to the police and was referred to financial-crimes detectives. They opened a case and discovered the scope of the fraud and loss.","A lonesome widow saw a new daughter in her favorite waitress. “At first, she brought a lot of joy into my life,” she said.

Russell Brandom,"As candidates across the country scrapped for control of Congress, last night’s midterms were particularly dramatic in Wisconsin. After eight years and a failed recall effort, Governor Scott Walker lost to Democratic candidate Tony Evers, in a closely fought race that remained a dead heat until 1:30AM local time. Evers, the superintendent of the state school system, ultimately pulled ahead by roughly 30,000 votes. The surprise win could have a significant impact on Wisconsin’s new Foxconn plant, which had been championed by Walker. The deal, which provided $4 billion in subsidies for just 13,000 jobs, had been criticized as corporate welfare by a number of local figures. That criticism has only intensified amid reports that Foxconn would transfer some of its Chinese workforce to work in the factory. (Foxconn has denied the reports.) “We’re going to have to hold Foxconn’s feet to the fire” Evers in particular had been broadly critical of the subsidies and Walker’s conduct in making the deal. “Just about anyone could’ve cut a better deal with Foxconn than Scott Walker did,” Evers told the Racine Journal Times in September. “It’s a lousy deal, and we’re going to have to hold Foxconn’s feet to the fire going forward.” Still, it remains to be seen how effectively Evers will be able to push back once in office. The most controversial part of the deal is the price tag — but it may be too late for the governor-elect to make any changes on that front. Few Wisconsin Democrats have pushed to cancel the deal entirely, particularly with construction and staffing already underway. As a state superintendent, Evers seemed resigned to the tax breaks, saying it would be difficult to “un-ring that bell.” Instead, he recommended improving the deal gradually, using later transportation projects tied to the factory as a way to extract more concessions on wages and local hiring. “I would really focus on compelling them to be good corporate citizens,” Evers told a local publication at the time. As governor, Evers could also push Foxconn more aggressively on environmental issues. The Walker administration had exempted Foxconn from Wisconsin’s usual environmental rules, allowing the new factory to discharge materials into nearby wetlands and draw as much as 7 million gallons a day from nearby Lake Michigan. Evers will have broad leeway to change those terms through the state’s Department of Natural Resources. Whoever he appoints as director of that agency will be able to set new rules on air pollution, water pollution and, most importantly, water withdrawal, which could have a significant impact on how Foxconn operates in the state. Evers has expressed particular interest in revising the rules around air pollution. “I’ve had many scientists look at that approval process and they’ve found many flaws with that decision made by the Department of Natural Resources,” Evers told the Wisconsin State Journal during the campaign. “So I would take that information and the approval and say, ‘How can we get from here to here?’” But less than 24 hours after the polls closed, even the fact of Evers’ election remains controversial. The preliminary margin of victory is too high to trigger a recount, but even after the race was called by numerous media outlets, the Walker campaign has refused to concede, citing damaged ballots. “Thousands of ballots were damaged and had to be recreated,” Walker senior adviser Brian Reisinger said in a statement. “Until there is a comparison of the original ballots to the recreated ballots, there is no way to judge their validity.” Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

David Murphy,"Maybe you bought a brand-new phone; maybe your phone just went through a major OS update. Either way, the result is the same: you can’t connect it via Bluetooth to your older car anymore, which means you’ve lost the ability to rock out, enrich yourself with podcasts, or make hands-free calls. Thankfully, you have a few options to fix this, ranging from “free and might not work” to “expensive and will definitely work.” Don’t balk about the potential cost, though; if you don’t want to deal with cables, Bluetooth is incredibly convenient when you’re driving (when it isn’t screwing up). Check your car’s manufacturer for firmware updates This one’s a long shot, but it’s possible that your car’s system—whatever it uses to make Bluetooth work—has some kind of update that will restore the functionality you no longer have. First, make sure the device you’re using is running the latest version of its operating system (your smartphone, likely). After that, hit up your car manufacturer’s website, visit its support pages—or wherever it keeps all the information you need to know about your specific vehicle—and see if there are any options for downloading updates for your vehicle’s stereo or entertainment system. If you’re confused, because car manufacturers don’t often make this process clear, you could always give your local dealer a call. You might even be able to bring your car in and have them check to see if there are any updates themselves—they might have to perform the update anyway, so it doesn’t hurt. They might tell you that they have to install software updates themselves, even if you can do it yourself for free. Or, as YouTube’s “ MrDazana ” put it: “I was told by my dealer it was going to cost me 160.00 + tax. I told them to fuck off and found it on the web. Enjoy. Very easy to install.” Connect using a different method If you’re lucky, your car stereo has an AUX port—3.5mm jack, just like your favorite pair of old headphones. You’re one cheap cable away from plugging in your smartphone (or your smartphone’s ugly dongle) and getting all of your music and podcasts over your car’s speakers. If not, and your car is old enough, you can always pick up a cheap cassette adapter with a built-in 3.5mm cable. And if you have a newer vehicle with built-in USB ports, try using those instead. You might be able to get some functionality out of your smartphone even if you can’t go the full Android Auto or Apple CarPlay route. You won’t be able to make or receive phone calls over your car stereo if you go the 3.5mm cable route, but at least you’ll be able to get your music or podcast. And while your phone calls will blast out of your speakers, too, you’ll have to awkwardly hold your device near your face for anyone to hear what you’re saying. At that point, you might want to unplug your device and switch to its speakerphone: it’s safer, more legal, and a lot easier to deal with. Buy a Bluetooth Adapter with an FM transmitter You’ve probably seen these dorky-looking devices before. Typically, you plug one end into your car’s cigarette lighter—or “12V accessory socket,” or whatever you want to call it—and you tune it to a specific FM frequency that isn’t already being used by a local radio station. You connect your smartphone to the device via Bluetooth, tune your car stereo to the device’s FM frequency, and everything will work seamlessly via your car stereo: music, phone calls, the works. In a perfect world, the FM transmitter device you pick up will support multiple Bluetooth pairings—so you and a friend can both control the tunes on your next road trip—and also offer a way to charge your device via USB in case all of your Bluetooth streaming is killing your battery. You might want look for one that also comes with a 3.5mm port, in case any device you’re using still needs a wired connection for sound. Install an adapter or a new aftermarket stereo Whenever I’m thinking about upgrading some component of my car—typically, the stereo unit—I head on over to Crutchfield. That’s not because I’m in love with the retailer (in fact, I usually purchase gear elsewhere), but because Crutchfield makes it easy to see what will work with your specific vehicle. As the site notes, you should be able to unlock Bluetooth functionality in your vehicle by installing an adapter—useful, if you want to keep your car’s current stereo for whatever reason. As I understand it, this only really applies if you didn’t have Bluetooth capabilities to begin with. If you did, and your smartphone no longer connects, I don’t think that adding an adapter is the right route. If this issue is really driving you crazy, you might want to splurge and buy an aftermarket head unit for your car. And if you do, you’ll likely have a ton of different options to pick from. My advice is to look for newer units above older, cheaper units, because you don’t want to buy something that hasn’t been updated in three years old and might still give your brand-new smartphone connection issues—just in case. As well, check for any reviews you can get your hands on, as well as any guides or recommendations from online enthusiast forums like /r/cars, /r/carav, caraudio.com, or diymobileaudio.com, to name a few. If your car doesn’t have room for an awesome new head unit, you can also pick up an amplifier with Bluetooth capabilities. You might even find yourself enjoying better sound quality from your crappy, old stereo, especially if you pick up an amp that gives you more options for fine-tuning equalizers than your stereo’s default “treble and bass” adjustments. You can probably get away with installing a new dashboard head unit yourself—especially after some helpful YouTube instruction, even if it’s for a completely different head unit for the exact make and model of your vehicle. As for an amplifier, that’s a bit more complex, and you might want to pay someone else to do it if you’re tentative about your skills. Ignore your stereo completely If you just need a way to make calls from your smartphone without holding it near your face, you can always pick up a simple Bluetooth speakerphone that attaches to some part of your car—like your sun visor. Here’s one example: A device like this isn’t ideal for streaming music from your smartphone, nor will it sound as rich as hearing your friends’ voices blasting out of your car’s speakers on a call, but it’s something—and it’s both cheap and easy to set up.","Maybe you bought a brand-new phone; maybe your phone just went through a major OS update.

Alicia Adamczyk,"There are two main upsides to running: Its a great and efficient form of exercise, and its also a way to get lost in nature and thought for 45 minutes to an hour (or however long your run is) with few to no distractions. Sure, a pre-made playlist can pump you up for your run or help you keep pace. But if you want to truly free your mind, suggests Martin Fritz Huber in Outside Online, try running without music. Hubers argument is that running outside is one of the few times people, particularly city dwellers, can immerse themselves in the natural world, without screens, text messages or notifications clouding your vision. When you preselect a soundtrack for your run, you are trying to tacitly control your experience. And in many cases, that is precisely the point: pump-me-up music to get you through those painful final miles, for instance. But, as that example illustrates, so much of our music comes loaded with preconceived mental associations; we already know how a certain song is going to make us feel. One of the great things about running is that it can provide a chance to get away from all that, if only for an hour or so. He calls it a microadventure for your brain: while you might be able to run your 3-mile loop blindfolded, you never know where your mind might wander. Music can boost your workout by distracting you from pain and fatigue, but its not a boon to every Read more Read Its also a way to reclaim your run as a time strictly for yourself and your mental and physical well-being. Rather than listening to podcasts to try to learn something during your run, or putting on music to speed it along, youre immersing yourself in the run for the runs sake. Taking in the sights along your route more fully, listening to whats going on around you, letting your brain take a break for a little while.

SARA BARRETT,"A lot of life in New York takes place on the street. We carry our crumpled laundry down the block to the dry cleaner; we push overloaded strollers to the playground; we grab a slice of pizza on the way to the subway after a long day at work. 
Our backpacks and briefcases are weighted with laptops and water bottles, reading glasses, lipstick, a change of clothes for the gym. One hand (the other is always holding a phone) has to juggle, balance, point, clutch, smooth, zip. And that means we drop a lot of stuff.
Last winter on the way to work I noticed a childs glove on the sidewalk, lying as if placed intentionally in the grid of cement squares. After that I began to notice other lost items. I liked the way the objects were framed by the crosswalk stripes, the cracked asphalt, the black dots of sidewalk gum, and I began to photograph them.
Its surprising how quickly things appear and disappear. A large stuffed unicorn, on the curb near a yogurt store on Amsterdam Avenue in the late evening had been collected by the time I returned to shoot it in the morning. I saw a red book perfectly set against an orange traffic cone on my way to get a coffee and five minutes later I had the coffee but the book was gone. Doormen constantly sweep papers and cigarettes and other haphazardly discarded objects out of view.
Once, walking to the street from the subway, I heard shouting. Your wallet! Your wallet! MISS! YOUR WALLET! The young woman attached to earbuds acknowledged the exasperated good Samaritan but only for a second and not long enough for a photo. She scooped up her wallet and returned it to her purse with the precision and efficiency of a shortstop making a double play.
Not long ago I was bent over photographing some French fries. 
A friend happened to walk by and, after I explained what I was doing, told me about being outside of Whole Foods one Thanksgiving when a man was carrying out a large tray for what appeared to be a family dinner turkey, stuffing, cranberry dressing, mashed potatoes, cornbread, brussels sprouts, pie, the works and dropped it.

This newly released trailer reveals how the reboot changes some of the story. Robot, once a Robinson traveling companion, now appears to be some kind of alien entity (though he does say his memorable ""Danger, Will Robinson!"" line in this trailer).

Sam Byford,"Nintendo is partnering with mobile games company Cygames on a new action RPG for phones. The game, Dragalia Lost, will be released in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau this summer, with subsequent launches to follow in North America and Europe. Nintendo says it will “jointly operate” the title with Cygames, “bringing to life the shared vision of a new gaming experience with worldwide appeal.” Cygames is best known for Granblue Fantasy, one of the most popular mobile games in Japan. Like many other Japanese mobile RPGs, it uses a “gacha” system for randomly unlocking new characters through in-game currency bought with real money, a controversial mechanic that Western games have emulated in the form of “loot boxes.” (Nintendo already does the same thing with Fire Emblem Heroes.) Nier Automata and Bayonetta developer PlatinumGames is working on a spin-off title for the PlayStation 4. Outgoing Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima revealed Dragalia Lost following the company’s earnings presentation, where it announced a year-on-year profit increase of more than 500 percent. As part of the Dragalia Lost partnership, Nintendo is acquiring a 5 percent stake in Cygames.","Nintendo is partnering with Cygames on Dragalia Lost, a new action RPG game for smartphones.

In Venezuela, the discussion about how long to stay, or where to flee and how to begin a new life, is never far from many people's minds. Every time I visit the country, there are fewer friends and contacts to catch up with.
An estimated 5,000 people pack up their lives and leave every day, eager to flee the economic collapse and humanitarian crisis which has beset the oil-rich nation.
More than 3m people have fled Venezuela in recent years. According to the UN, that number is expected to rise to more than 5m by the end of 2019, 
The vast majority of Venezuelans travel to other parts of South America. More than a million Venezuelans have chosen neighbouring Colombia as their new home, with half a million more travelling through it on their way further south to Ecuador, Peru and the countries beyond. 
The lucky ones, those with connections, family members already established and an education, have found work in other parts. But I've also met plenty of former professionals selling water or food on the streets of Peru and Colombia to make ends meet. 
""We are talking about people who are leaving not because of a natural disaster, not because of a war,"" says Claudia Vargas Ribas, a migration expert at the Simón Bolívar University in Caracas. 
New year, new challenges
The new year is widely expected to heap pressure on the Venezuelan government. On 10 January, Nicolás Maduro will be formally sworn in for another six years after being declared the winner in elections last May. These elections were largely boycotted by the opposition and were widely condemned by the US, the EU and most of Venezuela's neighbours. 
President Maduro blames ""imperialists"" - the likes of the US and Europe - for waging ""economic war"" against Venezuela and imposing sanctions on many members of his government.
But his critics say it is economic mismanagement - first by his predecessor Hugo Chávez and now President Maduro himself - that has brought Venezuela to its knees.
""We are going to have critical days and weeks beginning in January,"" says David Smolanksy, an exiled opposition leader and now the head of the Working Group on Venezuelan migration for the Organisation of American States.

The leadership of the opposition-controlled National Assembly changes in early January and some believe this could be the cause of further tension. 
""Maduro is going to want to project a show of strength,"" says Geoff Ramsey, the assistant director of the Venezuela Programme at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). 
""I think that's going to create a new level of dissatisfaction and the few that don't have an escape plan will be activating them after Maduro officially takes his new term."" 
The region reacts
Venezuela's crisis will continue to affect all of South America.
""The countries in the region are developing countries, we can't forget that,"" says Claudia Vargas Ribas. ""So receiving this quantity of people has made their internal affairs more complicated.""

 Venezuela's President Maduro is about to be sworn in for another six years in office
There have been efforts to co-ordinate the humanitarian response. There have been two meetings in Ecuador's capital Quito and a recognition that countries need to work together to solve the crisis. A third is scheduled for the first half of 2019. 
""If you compare what Latin America has done with what Europe has done [with its migrants] - Europe which has better conditions and is more economically developed - the example that Latin America is showing is enormous,"" says sociologist Tomás Páez, who co-ordinates the Global Project of the Venezuelan Diaspora. 
But with more and more Venezuelans arriving, could countries tighten their immigration rules? 
""If they put brakes on it, what will grow is irregularity,"" says Mr Páez, adding that drug-trafficking, prostitution and illegal industries will grow.
More to be done
Some experts believe what's been promised so far is a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed. 
""Regional governments are very interested in getting funding from the US and other donors"" says Geoff Ramsey. ""But they are much more apprehensive when it comes to providing mid- and long-term solutions to the crisis.""
Earlier this month, 95 organisations, co-ordinated by the UN Refugee Agency - the UNHCR - and the International Organization for Migration, launched the so-called Regional Response Plan for Refugees and Migrants from Venezuela.

 More than three million people have joined the recent exodus from Venezuela
The idea is to help respond to needs of those Venezuelans who are migrating as well as call on the international community to help fund aid efforts. 
Geoff Ramsey says it is a great start but promises on paper are not enough.
""A meaningful solution to Venezuela's displacement crisis will require Latin America to integrate these communities into their formal economies and job markets.""
The region doesn't just need to respond to the crisis, it needs to keep up the pressure against Mr Maduro too, says David Smolanksy.
""You need the strong arm and the friendly hand,"" he says. 
""The region needs to be firm against the dictatorship - as long as it continues, people are going to flee.""",The Venezuelan migration crisis is a major concern for South America and shows no sign of ending.,2018-12-30T00:40:21Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",The country that has lost three million people,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46524248,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/215F/production/_104734580_gettyimages-1059530450.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,lost,1

TONI BENTLEY,"This descent into moral vacuity has been in the works for decades. One might mark its shocking onset as when Mr. Martins was arrested on charges of beating his new wife, the ballerina Darci Kistler, in 1992. Given that Ms. Kistler was the last ballerina appointed by Mr. Balanchine — who said women “are not equal to men, they are better” — this violence had a particularly pointed symbolism. Ms. Kistler did not press charges. Mr. Martins was picked up for driving drunk a few days later in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in the company of a board member (He also was convicted in early August of drunken driving in a three-car crash after several such arrests.) Despite this, the board kept Mr. Martins in his job for over 25 more years as the head of both the company and the School of American Ballet, both multimillion-dollar institutions filled with young girls and women. Mr. Martins, for the most part, refused to bring any of Mr. Balanchine’s lead dancers, his former peers, to teach at the company. Given that ballet is passed on physically, body to body, this amounted to a robbery from Mr. Martins’s own dancers of the very tradition they inherited, hastening the erosion of Mr. Balanchine’s legacy. Unsurprisingly, social media, has played its predictably insidious role at New York City Ballet. The sacred fourth wall, between audience and artist, was a necessity to our work, to making the magic. Now ballerinas tweet from the wings about their injuries and vegan muffins, amassing vast Twitter and Instagram followers, with endless selfies and self-promotion. The company’s recent ad campaigns showing bare midriffs and legs, windblown hair, and suggestive poses by slim young dancers — have used sex as a marketing tool, lowering the lure to the prurient. In that context, the Finlay scandal is no surprise. The current lawsuit with its allegations of appalling misogynistic behavior is on a continuum. A doting ballet mother once asked Mr. Balanchine: “Will my daughter be a great dancer?” He replied in his characteristically sly manner: “La danse, Madame, c’est une question morale.” She wanted to hear about fame. He knew it was about character.","Once among the city's greatest cultural institutions, George Balanchine’s creation lost its way under his successor, Peter Martins.",2018-09-18T00:26:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Decline and Fall of New York City Ballet,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/opinion/new-york-city-ballet-decline-fall.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17Bentley-2/17Bentley-2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1
Frederic Lardinois,"Earlier this year, Parity Technologies seemingly lost about $280 million worth of Ethereum when a user of its wallet accidentally deleted a code library that made Parity’s wallets work. At least 1 million in ETH became frozen — and about $90 million of those were actually from Parity co-founder and Ethereum core developer Gavin Wood’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for its Pokadot blockchain technology. The money may not be lost forever, though. At TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin, Woods and Parity CEO and co-founder Jutta Steiner retraced their story of what happened. “A library that governs the logic of the wallets that people use had a bug, which was due to a delicate refactoring at the time when the tools weren’t yet that developed,” Steiner said, arguing it’s a symptom of the technology still being young at the time. “We hadn’t figured out how to deal with bugs.” As TechCrunch editor-at-large Mike Butcher MBE noted, though, the bug that caused this freeze was actually known and had been reported long before it caused this issue. Steiner didn’t disagree, but noted that this issue wasn’t reported as a critical security flaw at the time. “It sounded like a nice-to-have update,” she said. Steiner, however, said that she is confident that a fix for this issue, which could unfreeze the money, may happen when the next scheduled update goes live in the next four to six months. How upset is Woods about this? It doesn’t seem like he’s too fazed by it. “It’s a long-term savings account for us right now,” he said.","Earlier this year, Parity Technologies seemingly lost about $280 million worth of Ethereum when a user of its wallet accidentally deleted a code library that made Parity’s wallets work.

MIKE HALE,"The new “Lost in Space,” set in 2048, keeps the old show’s central dynamic: The Robinsons, mother, father and three children, have adventures in space with the flyboy Don West, the eccentric Dr. Smith and a large robot that likes to say “danger.” But turning a square-jawed, morally uncomplicated adventure into something more contemporary — culturally sensitive domestic melodrama — requires a lot of tweaks. So the Robinson marriage is now troubled, and John Robinson (Toby Stephens) is an absent father who’s returned for the voyage to Alpha Centauri. Maureen Robinson (Molly Parker) is a brilliant scientist and the family alpha — no more doing the interstellar laundry — though it’s not a total feminist victory, because the father now gets to be both the action hero and the more empathetic parent. Young Will Robinson (Maxwell Jenkins) is still a pint-size savior, coming up with last-minute solutions to deadly problems, but he’s gone emo, without the breezy self-assurance of the original Will. That confidence has been transferred to his older sisters, Penny (Mina Sundwall) and Judy (Taylor Russell). Diversity is served by the biracial Judy, now a half sister. (It’s startling, for a 2018 ensemble drama, that the show has no demonstrably gay character.) More radical are the changes to the nonfamily members. The formerly gung-ho Don (Ignacio Serricchio) is a wisecracking mercenary, though he can still be counted on in the crunch. The robot is now an H.R. Giger-style organic nightmare. And Dr. Smith (Parker Posey), in the absence of the old show’s campy jokiness, reads as a full-on sociopath, which can have a deadening effect on the new show’s tone. These returning characters aren’t the Robinsons’ only company — the formerly solo family is now part of a large mission, and a number of other travelers are stranded with it, giving rise to conflicts and attractions that can be seen coming from a parsec away. The adult actors acquit themselves well, though Ms. Posey’s character isn’t quite playable — Dr. Smith is so reprehensible that when she’s occasionally, obligatorily allowed to be sympathetic, it makes no sense. The real pleasure of “Lost in Space,” beyond some competently handled action, are the appealing performances of Ms. Russell, Ms. Sundvall and Mr. Jenkins as the Robinson children. If you decide to take the trip, they’re excellent company.

Nick Douglas,"It’s a good time to get into Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the role-playing game featured in Stranger Things and the podcast The Adventure Zone. The game has lost its nerdy stigma and is trendy among artsy parents and their kids. But starting out can feel intimidating, with all of the game’s books and charts and maps. Even if you’ve found a dungeon master and fellow players, now you have to create a character. You might be tempted to get really weird with it—I was. But if you plan to stick with this character for a while, you don’t want to saddle yourself with someone that you eventually hate to play. Here’s how to make a D&amp;D hero that will best introduce you to the game. When you hear about role-playing games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, you probably picture a… Read more Read Pick Your Race and Class Wisely Every character has a race and class. The options can be dizzying. For my first game, I was a tiefling warlock. It was an obscure and complicated character, and I was glad to abandon it after just one session. My next character was a dwarf fighter—much more sustainable. Each race comes with different stats and abilities. For example, dwarves can see in utter darkness, but they can’t walk as fast as humans or elves. There are over two dozen playable character races in the latest version of D&amp;D, but according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of some official D&amp;D stats, humans are the most popular race by far, and most characters are either a human, half-elf, or elf. If you’re starting out, you should probably try a race you already understand from fiction and mythology: a human, elf, dwarf, gnome, or halfling (a public-domain hobbit). If you pick something exotic like the bird species Aarakocra, you’ll spend half your time figuring out what your deal is. And so will your fellow players. That can be fun for a later game, but it’s a headache when you’re also figuring out how to attack a monster or talk to a shopkeep. Your class is even more important. That’s your specialty, which largely determines how you achieve your goals in an adventure. You can theoretically start with any class, but if you choose a less obvious one like druid or warlock, your dungeon master might need to do some extra research to figure out how to use your skills. That can be a pain if they’re already busy teaching you the basics of the game. Fighter is the most popular, and an ideal class for starting out. You’ll be dealing in direct physical conflict, avoiding complicated magic, and you’ll be harder to kill. As gamer Joshua Utterback put it, fighters are fun, diverse, easy, survivable, and important to the group. In a combat session, you’ll be making the biggest contribution, with the least pawing through the rulebook. Also consider the rogue, a stealthy, dextrous class that’s useful in and out of combat, or the barbarian, a more reckless warrior class. If you really want to cast some spells right away, try the cleric instead of the wizard. You’ll start out with the ability to heal other players, which will make you popular with the other players and build teamwork, which is crucial in a D&amp;D campaign. Match your class to your race, says Joseph Capehart, RPG coordinator for the game shop Brooklyn Strategist. “Many people step to the table thinking ‘How do I fit into this story?’ Human fighters and elven wizards are easier to conceptualize and ‘fit’ into the story.” As the FiveThirtyEight chart shows, big brutish races like half-orcs and goliaths tend to be barbarians; elves pick classes related to magic or nature. Even my tiefling warlock makes sense, Capehart says: “Tieflings are creatures with demonic or devilish ancestry, therefore it is easy to conceptualize them selling their soul to a devil or demon.” Down the road, of course, you can try more challenging combos. “It’s really inspiring for newer players to see their halfling barbarian or tiefling druid party member having a blast at the table,” says Capehart. You can even use a pre-generated character. Grab an official pre-gen character sheet and you can concentrating on building your character’s story. If you build your own, check Geek &amp; Sundry’s guides to starting out with each class. Playing tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder thankfully doesn’t carry the same… Read more Read Follow the Story, Not the Numbers Capehart applies a story-first philosophy to all parts of character creation: The advice I give everyone when starting out is to follow the story, not the numbers. If they have the time, I suggest they read about the world itself before constructing a character. The official D&amp;D universe of The Forgotten Realms has a ton of lore and information for players to create ideas from. What this does is build a connection between the player and the character. As their character’s backstory is crafted, they draw closer to the personality, goals, history, and even the sound of their character. They become more than a piece of paper and some dice. If you enjoy the story you’re telling, he says, you’ll enjoy the game whether or not the dice roll in your favor. The big advantage of tabletop RPGs is that they can tell complex, free-form stories; lean into that instead of obsessing over which armor will give you the best defensive stats. If you expect to use your character for more than one or two sessions, give them some depth. “I fell into a pitfall early on by creating two dimensional characters,” says Capehart. He found himself “saying the same things, making the same decisions, and creating flat relationships. I was so bored that I would find myself looking for ways for my characters to die just so I could switch to something else!” Don’t let your character stats dictate your story. Just because your intelligence score is low, or your charisma is high, doesn’t mean you have to roleplay those attributes all the time. Those stats are more about the skills you test by rolling dice. (Of course, if you want to roleplay your stats, you can!) Try a Different Game While D&amp;D is the oldest RPG and still the most popular, it’s not the simplest, especially during combat. And it’s oriented toward a certain kind of story, emphasizing dungeon crawls and fights. Plus it’s set in a medieval fantasy realm, whereas you might want to play in the modern day, or in a cyberpunk future. There are hundreds of roleplaying games in all kinds of genres. Go to your local gaming shop and ask an employee to help you find a game that seems fun for you. But some games, like Shadowrun or Mage, are harder to learn as your very first RPG. When it comes to roleplaying games, there are two titans that dominate: Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th… Read more Read Capehart recommends Blades in the Dark, a steampunk urban fantasy game. “While BitD is pretty specific in genre,” he says, “it offers great tools for players to hop into the game by laying out a lot of the framework for you.” He also likes how the game rewards players for their narrative choices. He also recommends FATE Core, a system that adapts to any genre. “It really stresses that the rules should not get in the way of the story, and encourages the Game Master to tell a story with the players vs the temptation to play against them.” You’ll need to spend more time figuring out your setting and characters, but you’ll spend less time doing arithmetic. There are also many homages to D&amp;D to appeal to different strengths. If all the roleplaying and grand quests freak you out, try Dungeon Crawl Classics, which focuses on searching dungeons and killing monsters. If you’d rather interact deeply with other characters, try Dungeon World, which takes more of a collaborative-theater approach. Whatever game you choose, you’ll have a better experience if someone in the group is an experienced tabletop gamer. If everyone in your group is new, try playing at your local games store, or looking for a dungeon master on Craigslist or Nextdoor. They’ll help you get the feel of the game, and make things a lot more comfortable. Then once you’ve gotten the hang of it, you can start going crazy.","It’s a good time to get into Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the role-playing game featured in Stranger Things and the podcast The Adventure Zone.

"Ashley Strickland, CNN","The discovery of a new type of armored dinosaur has its roots in Asia Researchers believe it emigrated to what is now southern Utah 76 million years ago (CNN) The fossil of a previously unknown 76 million-year-old armored dinosaur that once roamed the lost continent of Laramidia is finally going on display after being found in the scenic Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah in 2008. The ankylosaurid fossil, known as Akainacephalus johnsoni, is now on exhibit in the National History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City. The genus name essentially means ""spike head,"" but the species name is in honor of museum volunteer Randy Johnson, a retired chemist who helped prepare the skull. ""I never thought that I would have the opportunity to actually work on fossils that could be important for paleontologists,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""Now that I'm a museum volunteer, I'm getting the opportunity to work on a large variety of fossils and consult with top paleontologists -- it's like a dream second career. I couldn't believe it when they told me they are naming the ankylosaur after me, a once in a lifetime honor."" Akainacephalus walked on four legs directly beneath its body and was considered medium-size, measuring between 13 and 16 feet long and 3½ feet tall. The characteristic bony armor covered it from head to tail, including bony plates for protection. Its skull was covered with spikes and horns. The fossil includes a complete skull, most of the vertebral column, fore and hind limb elements, bony body armor neck rings and spiked armor plates and a complete tail club. It is the most complete skeleton of this type of armored dinosaur ever found in the southwestern United States. It was found in the monument's Kaiparowits Formation, where rocks and mud were deposited by rivers and streams. The fossil was discovered in 2008 during a paleontological expedition, along with a duck-bill dinosaur, a new species of turtle and a relative of alligators. The bones took almost four years to prepare. A study about the find was published in the journal PeerJ on Thursday in conjunction with the announcement of the exhibit. Ankylosaurids were herbivores known for their intimidating bony tail clubs and body armor, and their fossils have been found in North America before. But this well-preserved fossil revealed a surprising detail. The ankylosaurid fossils associated with North America had smooth bony armor on their skulls. This one had pronounced spiky, bony armor covering the skull and snout, closely related to Asian ankylosaurids that lived 125 million years ago. ""A reasonable hypothesis would be that ankylosaurids from Utah are related to those found elsewhere in western North America, so we were really surprised to discover that Akainacephalus was so closely related to species from Asia,"" said Randall Irmis, co-author of the study and curator of paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Utah, said in a statement. The fossil helped the researchers determine that at least two immigration events occurred during the Late Cretaceous period, resulting in two groups of ankylosaurid dinosaurs. When sea levels reached some of the highest in the history of our planet, the Western Interior Seaway effectively split the North American continent in two. The western and eastern portions of the continent were isolated. To the west was Laramidia, and to the east was Appalachia. These would come together to form North America once again, resulting in the two essentially becoming lost continents. Akainacephalus would have roamed the southern part of Laramidia, which once stretched from the Arctic Circle to the Gulf of Mexico. But the sea level lowered briefly on several occasions, allowing dinosaurs and animals to go between Asia and western North America across the Beringian land bridge. This also accounts for the the Asian ankylosaurid dinosaurs moving into North America. ""It is always exciting to name a new fossil taxon, but it is equally exciting if that taxon also provides additional insights into the bigger picture of its life, such as its diet or aspects of its behavior, and the environment it lived in,"" said Jelle Wiersma, lead study author and doctoral student in the department of geosciences at James Cook University in Australia, in a statement. Almost every species of dinosaur discovered in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is new to science, including Akainacephalus. This part of Laramidia was incredibly diverse in plant and animal life between 75 million and 80 million years ago. Possible reasons for the area's diversity include sea level, climate differences across latitude or barriers like mountains and rivers. ""It is extremely fascinating and important for the science of paleontology that we can read so much information from the fossil record, allowing us to better understand extinct organisms and the ecosystems they were a part of,"" Wiersma said. ""A major long-term goal of our work in southern Utah is to try and understand why the species in GSENM differ from relatives of the same geologic age found in other parts of Laramidia.""",The fossil of a previously unknown 76 million-year-old armored dinosaur that once roamed the lost continent of Laramidia is finally going on display after being found in the scenic Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah in 2008.

Jacob Kleinman,"It seems like every few months we hear what’s basically the same story about someone who bought a bunch of bitcoin but lost access to it once the cryptocurrency became really valuable. The latest, from Engadget, tells the tale of a reporter who managed to salvage $200,000 in bitcoin after traveling to Hong Kong and getting extremely lucky. So if you’re just getting into bitcoin, you’re probably worried about making sure it’s safe and secure, and if you’ve been holding onto some bitcoin for years you may want to upgrade your storage setup. Here are the best ways to keep your bitcoin secure—or at least as secure as possible. How do Bitcoin Wallets Work? The key thing to understand is that no matter what you do, you won’t actually be storing the bitcoin itself. That’s because a bitcoin isn’t an object, it’s an encrypted address on the blockchain. What you own is a unique key that unlocks a specific bitcoin location, and that’s what you need to be protecting at all times by storing it in a wallet. With that covered, there are a few different ways to store your bitcoin depending on how secure you want to be and how much you plan to use it on a regular basis. Why You Should Use a Hardware Wallet The easier way to store your bitcoin and other cryptocurrency is in a digital wallet online, or locally on your smartphone or computer. But leaving your bitcoin in public view can open you up to attacks from hackers and phishing scams. That’s why the best option is a hardware wallet that stores your bitcoin offline. Most hardware wallets look like USB drives and can be easily connected to a computer. They use a PIN number for security, along with a secondary password called a “seed” in case you forget the PIN. If you forget both passwords you’re pretty much screwed, so it might be worth writing the seed down somewhere safe offline. The other biggest drawback to a hardware wallet is that if you lose it you can’t recover the bitcoin. So make sure to create at least one backup on another encrypted storage device. As for the specific model, there are plenty of solid options for under $100. Wired recommends Trezor or the Ledger Nano S, and you can find a more detailed comparison of the current top models here. Other Options Another issue with hardware wallets is that they can make the process of actually spending your bitcoin a lot more difficult. The best solution is to keep a small amount of bitcoin in a digital wallet like Mycelium Wallet, that’s designed to work well with offline storage devices. Finally, if you want to keep your bitcoin offline but don’t want to deal with a hardware wallet, you might want to consider a paper wallet instead. This is really just a piece of paper with your public and private keys printed on it, which can be used to access your bitcoin. If you don’t plan on touching your bitcoin for a while then a paper wallet is a good option. Just make sure you put your paper wallet somewhere very safe —and then don’t forget where it is.","It seems like every few months we hear what’s basically the same story about someone who bought a bunch of bitcoin but lost access to it once the cryptocurrency became really valuable.

Sally Yates,"Sally Yates is the former Deputy Attorney General and Acting Attorney General of the US. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. (CNN) It was May 6, 1986, and I was just days away from graduating from law school. Late in the afternoon, my mother called the Law Review office looking for me. I had just left to grab a quick dinner before settling in for a long night of studying for exams. My friend who answered the phone that afternoon would be asked to do something no friend should have to do -- tell me that my father was dead. This was in the days before the advent of cell phones, so there was no real way to track me down. My friend knew that I was going to the local Kinko's copy shop (another sign of the 1980's) before returning to the library, and was waiting outside the shop when I arrived. He told me that my mother had called, and that my father had died. I intuitively knew that it wasn't a car accident, heart attack, or other accidental death. I knew that my father had taken his life. My father, then 56, had struggled with depression for years, and in the months leading up to his death, his suffering had been particularly acute. My mother, sister and I had all urged him to get professional help, but he was worried about the stigma associated with psychological treatment. He had been a lawyer and appellate court judge, and he was concerned that it would ""get out."" While the medical profession viewed depression as a disease, the general public did not. And like many in my dad's generation, especially men, he saw his depression as a sign of weakness rather than illness. My father's struggle with depression was cyclical, but always present, and the severity would ebb and flow. We would all be so hopeful during his brighter days, but darkness would inevitably follow. We were an incredibly close family, not just talking about everything, but feeling each other's joys and sorrows. And yet we felt helpless to bring him out of that darkness. But looking back, I know that we weren't helpless, and I will live every day with regret that I didn't more forcefully insist that he get help. I haven't spoken much publicly of my father's death -- while it was over 30 years ago, it is still knock-the-breath-out-of-me painful. I also hate that for him, as for others who take their lives, they come to be defined by how they died rather than how they lived. And to me, this diminishes the value of their lives. But I feel a responsibility -- underscored by the events of last week with Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade's deaths, and the disturbing news about the rising suicide rate -- to use whatever voice I now have to help to dispel the shame or stigma associated with mental illness and to encourage those suffering to get treatment. My dad was someone who lived with an intensity known by few, devoted to his family and friends, always looking for those who needed his help with issues large or small. In a memorial, a friend and judicial colleague spoke of him as ""the most loyal man I ever knew, and if somehow I were in the innermost depths of danger or needed a strong man by my side, and I was told I could choose one man to go with me, it would have been Kelley Quillian."" But yet, there he was, drowning in the innermost depths of danger himself, and he was the one who needed help. Several years ago, I talked with a friend of mine who also suffered from depression about how it feels, and he told me that when someone is in that abyss, suicide doesn't appear as an option, it presents as the only option. But of course it's not. No one would expect someone suffering from a broken leg, or kidney disease, or a blood disorder to tough it out and handle it themselves. Likewise, one suffering from a mental health disorder shouldn't expect that they can cure themselves of this disease. But despite progress, some still view mental illness as a character flaw. It's not. After his death, many people told me how surprised they were. I remember one friend telling me that he thought my dad ""had the world by the tail."" But as is common with depression, those suffering can often live tormented beneath a facade of normalcy. The fact is that none of us knows what demons someone is carrying around inside of them. And that inevitably leads to society's desire to divine ""why"" someone took his or her life -- to find a neat answer that will satisfy our need to ascribe a rational thought process to something that is by definition an irrational act. Some suicides are planned, and others, like my father's, are the tragic result of the convergence of a moment of overwhelming despair and opportunity. But both are the consequence of illness, and are often are preventable with the right treatment. I know that some suicide survivors may feel anger or resentment toward the person who took his or her life. While I understand this reaction, I have never felt anger toward my father. Rather, I have only been heartbroken that he was so profoundly sad that he didn't want to live any more. I missed a call from my dad that afternoon. We talked every day, and I'll never know whether, had I answered the phone, he would be alive today. But more important than my regret is his lost opportunity to live a full and healthy life -- to have met my husband, known the joys of his grandchildren, and grown old with my mother, the love of his life. It doesn't have to be this way. Depression, bipolar disorder and other mental health disorders are treatable diseases. Reach for that lifeline. There is light on the other side of darkness.

David Murphy,"It happens. You’re absentmindedly browsing through your photos while enjoying a lovely view or a summery drink. You tap around—and then realize you’ve accidentally deleted a ton of photos on your device. You panic. Have you just lost your precious memories forever? Though a Lifehacker reader didn’t send us this question directly, we stumbled across it on Reddit’s “HotTo” forum, and we figured it’s worth exploring to save you a day’s worth of stress (and frantic web searches for “photo restoration app”). Reddit user fire_arms writes : “I’m sobbing, I just deleted all of my pregnancy photos and the video of me telling my husband I was pregnant on accident. there has to be a way to get these back right? I have a Samsung J6"" On iOS, this one’s easy. If you delete a photo (or all of your photos ever), they’re not gone for good the moment you tap the trash can icon. Scroll down through your albums in Photos. The very last one you should see—in the main “Albums” listing, not the secondary “My Albums” listing—is an album called Recently Deleted. You can’t miss it. Its icon is boring, gray, and trash-can-shaped. Tap that, and you’ll be able to restore anything you accidentally deleted. Your iPhone will keep deleted photos around for just around a month or so. the dates listed on the photos are countdowns. Once they reach zero, the photos are automatically exiled from your device forever. The same is true for any photos you delete on iCloud. They aren’t gone forever—at least, not initially. Just go restore them from the Recently Deleted folder. Ta-da. Android users have a similar deal. First off, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be automatically backing up all of your photos to Google Photos. If it isn’t already installed on your Android device, find it, install it, and set it to automatically Back Up &amp; Sync your device’s photos with Google’s cloud. With Google Photos having your back, restoring deleted images is easy. If you ever accidentally wipe something off your phone (via Google Photos), you have an easy way to restore it. Just pull up Google’s Photos app, tap on the hamburger icon, tap on Trash, tap on “Restore,” and select any photos you want to raise from the dead. If you delete an image in another photos app, just go to Google Photos, find the picture, and download it to your device. If you’ve deleted your photos before doing setting up Google Photos, Reddit user td888 recommends the free Android app DiskDigger photo recovery, which appears to have worked to solve fire_arms’ initial problem. Install this as soon as you realize your accidental deletion. The app scans through your device’s cache and thumbnails for recently deleted photos and, if it finds what you just removed, it’ll give you the option to restore your pictures. You might not be as thrilled with the results, as DiskDigger notes, but it’s better than nothing: “If using the app with a non-rooted device, the app will likely recover lower-resolution versions of your photos. This is a limitation that cannot be avoided. To recover the original full-resolution photos, your device must be rooted.” Do you have a tech question keeping you up at night?

David Riggs,"More posts by this contributor As a relentless swarm of successful cyber attacks severely disrupt companies in every industry and require enormous expenditures to repair the damage, what typically gets lost in the shuffle is that some industries are victimized more than others — sometimes far more. The corporate victim that almost always grabs this dubious spotlight is the healthcare industry — the second-largest industry in the U.S. and one in which hacker meddling of operations not only costs lots of time, money and operational downtime, but threatens lives. The healthcare industry itself is partly responsible. In a seemingly admirable quest to maximize the quality of patient care, tunnel vision gives short shrift to other priorities, specifically cybersecurity. In aggregate, healthcare organizations on average spend only half as much on cybersecurity as other industries. For this and other reasons, such as the unusually high value of stolen patient records on the black market, attracting extra-large flocks of hackers, hospitals especially find themselves in a never-ending cyber war zone. FortiGuard Labs, a major security protection firm, reports that in 2017, healthcare saw an average of almost 32,000 intrusion attacks per day per organization as compared to more than 14,300 per organization in other industries. Some attacks are outright deadly. For example, MedStar Health, a huge, Maryland-based healthcare system, was severely incapacitated by a ransomware attack that made national headlines when, among other things, it threatened lives. Compromised by a well-known security vulnerability, MedStar Health was not only forced to shut down its email and vast records database, but was unable to provide radiation treatment to cancer patients for days. Such trouble typically starts when a doctor or other healthcare worker is persuaded to open an email sent by an attacker and click a link or attachment that downloads malware to his computer, a so-called “phishing” attack. The attacker can then use this software to gain access to the healthcare organization’s financial, administrative and clinical information systems. Attackers also can use the health network to spread into connected medical devices and equipment, such as ventilators, X-ray and MRI machines, medical lasers and even electric wheelchairs. Any medical device connected to a network is potentially at risk from being taken over and exploited by hackers. Hospitals and other healthcare providers must practice better cybersecurity hygiene. Compounding the threat are prevalent and vulnerable Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, which integrate components and software from dozens of suppliers with minimal concern for security. Even individual patients can be targeted. A few years ago, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney’s doctors disabled his pacemaker’s capabilities because there were concerns about reports that attackers could hack such devices and kill the patient. It’s a dire situation that must be addressed. Hospitals and other healthcare providers must practice better cybersecurity hygiene. For starters, healthcare organizations must improve the speed and thoroughness of software patching and update processes. As much as possible, organizations also need to use threat intelligence and automation, as well as institute cyber-awareness training programs to protect against social media attacks and other attack vectors. As IoMT devices proliferate, more elaborate network segmentation and inspection is required. A segmented strategy enables organizations to institute checks and policies at various points of the network to control users, applications and data flow and to more quickly identify and isolate security threats. And on the network visibility front, healthcare organizations need more insight throughout the network, including the cloud. Hospitals and other healthcare organizations must do a better job of protecting patient’s records, as well. Since the transformation from paper records to digitized Electronic Health Records (EHRs), records are commonly updated and then sent by doctors to specialists in other hospitals. The problem is that hospitals are not banks, where financial information is locked up and not shared. This unencrypted information is vulnerable to profit-hungry hacker attacks. A solution to this is likely to be homomorphic encryption, an impressive technology that allows for the encryption of data-in-use and that has tremendous potential to lock down the most valuable medical information. Specifically, this technology can secure and protect sensitive medical records and personally identifiable information (PII), often the target of cyber thieves. Notwithstanding the fact that data-rich healthcare records are worth more than 10 times a credit card on the black market, this would shut down the most aggressive “data-focused” hackers. These improvements will not occur without substantial monetary investment and effort. It’s commendable that hospitals focus overwhelmingly on day-to-day quality of care, but times change, and they must look at their mission with a broader perspective. Because they fail to do so, hospitals typically pay up in almost non-stop ransomware attacks, minimizing the possibility of additional health threats while systems are down. Among the obstacles that hospitals face in pursuing the path toward change is intensifying merger and acquisition activity in the healthcare sector. IT integration challenges, including different medical technologies, create additional vulnerabilities, as does the need to share information between newly merged organizations. The reputation of and trust in healthcare organizations depends on their understanding of the true extent of threats and taking sufficient measures to guard against them. The healthcare industry has no choice but to improve its capabilities regarding security. Nothing short of our lives are at stake.","As a relentless swarm of successful cyber attacks severely disrupt companies in every industry and require enormous expenditures to repair the damage, what typically gets lost in the shuffle is that some industries are victimized more than others.",2018-08-09T20:00:20Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",The healthcare industry is in a world of cybersecurity hurt,http://techcrunch.com/2018/08/09/the-healthcare-industry-is-in-a-world-of-cybersecurity-hurt/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/healthlaptop.jpg?w=566,techcrunch,TechCrunch,lost,1

David Murphy,"If you were expecting Apple to wait a week until its new iPad starts shipping to officially launch iOS 11.3, you lost that bet. iOS 11.3, a one-day exclusive for said iPad, is now available for all iOS devices. And here’s how to find all of its most compelling features and updates: How to upgrade to iOS 11.3 If you’re a longtime iOS user, you should know what you’re doing by now. But just in case you need a refresher on how to update your device with the latest version of iOS—if you don’t want to wait for Apple to pester you about the update, that is—here’s how: First, make sure you’re connected to wi-fi. Tap on the Settings icon (or swipe down and start typing in “Settings,” if you forgot where you moved it). Scroll the screen down a bit until you see “General.” Tap that. Tap on “Software Update.” Wait for your iOS device to check for an update. Start downloading the iOS 11.3 update. It’ll take some time to download, depending on your connection, and a little more time for your device to prepare and verify the update. Once it’s ready, your device will automatically restart and start installing iOS 11.3. Go get some delicious lemonade or take a little walk around the neighborhood while your device chugs along. (It took my iPhone 8 Plus nearly 10 minutes on the dot to finish updating.) iOS 11.3... now what? You have the new iOS! Great! Apple doesn’t drop a big ol’ notification on your home screen to guide you through all the new features, but that’s OK. Here’s what’s worth knowing about: Battery Throttling Apple took a lot of grief late last year for reducing the performance of older devices in an effort to get as much out of your device’s aging battery as it can. If you care more about having a speedy iPhone than having one that can last you the entire day on a single charge, you can now adjust how Apple deals with the performance/battery life compromise. Tap on Settings, then tap on Battery, and then Battery Health (Beta). On this screen, you’ll get to see your battery’s maximum capacity—100% is good—as well as a recommendation for a battery replacement if yours is old and affecting your device’s performance. If you have an older device and want to turn off Apple’s battery throttling, just tap on the little blue hyperlink (if prompted). If your device is running in tip-top shape, you won’t be able to turn off battery throttling, making this a feature you’ll want to check every six months or so. New Animoji You can now send clever messages to your friends by taking the form of a virtual lion, bear, dragon, or skull. You’ll find all these in the same place you normally find animoji (within the Messages app, of course). Business Chat You know how you can chat with businesses—or at least, their AI bots—on social networks like Facebook? iOS 11.3 brings these conversations directly into Messages but, as always, it’s completely hit-or-miss as to which businesses you can chat with (and what you can do). Theoretically, you should be prompted with a little indicator that lets you start a Messages chat with a business when you search for it across a number of places, such as Safari, Siri, Maps, or Spotlight. There isn’t a giant list of businesses that you can actively chat with—which would be incredibly helpful. Instead, you’ll have to check and see whether the company you want to talk to supports the feature each time you’re feeling conversational. Look for the little Messages icon next to the company’s name in a Spotlight search, for example. When it works—I struck up a nice little chat with Newegg today—you’ll be able to perform a number of tasks directly out of Messages. In my case, I could check on the status of an order, make a return, or ask general questions. I couldn’t shop directly for a particular item, a feature that will definitely make its way to Business Chat (with Apple Pay supported, naturally). And I couldn’t make an appointment, since that’s not what Newegg does, but you should also be able to manage your calendar and create appointments with businesses directly from a Business Chat... someday. Health Records Open up Apple’s Health app, and you’ll now see a brand-new option for Health Records—still in beta. Apple wants this to be the dumping ground for all the various tests you take at the doctor (or across multiple doctors), which sounds great, especially if you’re travelling between a few different networks that each keep separate health portals. This, of course, depends on whether your provider is willing to play ball with Apple’s system. While I could find one network I’ve been to recently, I couldn’t find the largest—California’s good ol’ Kaiser Permanente. So, once again, my health records feel a bit piecemeal. But I applaud apple for getting the ball rolling, at least. Apple Music Time for a ‘90s throwback. Apple is going the MTV route by dropping a lot more video content into Apple Music. You can now watch a ton of music videos—all ad-free—and follow specific video playlists. To burn through your device’s data plan with video content, pull up Apple Music, tap Browse, and look for the new Music Videos category. Data Privacy You might see a new icon pop up the next time “an Apple feature asks to use your personal information,” describes Apple. This icon—two people holding hands—is a nice little way to let you know that the request is authentic. It’ll only appear when you’re using Apple services, not third-party apps. Tap on the icon, and you’ll get more information about why a particular Apple service, like iTunes, wants the information it wants. This is also a nice little precursor to some larger privacy changes dropping in May, when Apple users in some European Union countries—and later, worldwide—will be given the option to get a copy of the data Apple knows about them, modify that data, deactivate their Apple accounts, or delete their accounts entirely. What’s missing? If you’ve been following the iOS 11.3 betas, you might notice a few features missing from this final iOS 11.3 release. Notably, iCloud support for Messages doesn’t exist—which drives me nuts, because it’s 2018 and I’d like to stop having to delete the same texts off my iPhone and MacBook thank you—as well as AirPlay 2. Sorry to those with six HomePods who were looking to blow the roof off once iOS 11.3 launched. No stereo sound for you.","If you were expecting Apple to wait a week until its new iPad starts shipping to officially launch iOS 11.3, you lost that bet. iOS 11.3, a one-day exclusive for said iPad, is now available for all iOS devices.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Encarni Pindado Every year for the past 13 years, a group of women have travelled 4,000km (2,485 miles) across Mexico searching for their children who went missing while migrating through the country from Central America. Photojournalist Encarni Pindado has spoken to some of the women about their plight and what they aim to achieve with their Caravan of Mothers of Missing Migrants. Image copyright Encarni Pindado The caravan brings together mothers from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. They cross the border between Guatemala and Mexico on inflatable rafts to symbolise the risks the migrants face when crossing into Mexico. They then travel together across Mexico in search of their relatives who disappeared. In the 13 years since the caravan was first organised by the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement, 270 missing migrants have been located. Part of the idea behind the caravan is also to denounce and highlight the issue of disappearances of migrants in transit through Mexico. Of the 270 missing migrants who have been found, 90% are men. Women are much harder to find, especially when they have been forced into the sex trade. In order to boost their chances of finding those women, the movement has forged links with organisations run by sex workers. They place pictures of the missing migrants in brothels in the hope someone will recognise their loved ones. Image copyright Encarni Pindado Clementina Murcia González has been part of the mothers' caravan for the last five years. Two of her sons went missing: Jorge in 1984 and Mauricio in 2001. With the help of a a local radio station, Radio Progresso, she recently managed to track down Mauricio and will be reunited with him in the Mexican city of Guadalajara as part of this year's caravan. ""Sixteen kisses and 16 hugs is all I want from my son,"" she says about the impending reunion. Her search for Jorge continues. Image copyright Encarni Pindado Edit Gutierrez's son left Honduras twice. The first time he was kidnapped by Mexico's infamous drugs cartel, the Zetas, and witnessed how they killed and burned some of the other migrants he had travelled with. The army eventually rescued him and deported him back to Honduras. In August 2012, he left Honduras for the second time, paying a people smuggler $3,000 (£2,250) to reach Reynosa, in the north of Mexico. There he lost all communication with his family. Image copyright Encarni Pindado Isidora de Jesus Zuniga Colindres from Honduras is searching for her son Josue Ildefonso Molinas Zuniga. Josue last called from the US-Mexican border town of Nuevo Laredo on 15 December, 2013. He was headed to New York to join his father, who had received temporary protected status in the US years earlier, while his mother stayed behind in Honduras. Image copyright Encarni Pindado María Clementina Vásquez Hernández is from Honduras. She is looking for her daughter María Ines who emigrated in 2002, leaving behind her infant son. María Clementina has been raising her grandson in María Ines's absence. ""I'm not even sure what her face looks like now,"" she says about her daughter. Image copyright Encarni Pindado María Elena Larios has been looking for her son Heriberto, who disappeared on 6 March, 2010. He left La Libertad in El Salvador, to find work in the United States, but as far as María Elena knows, he never made it. In the southern Mexican town of Huixtla people tell her to look for her son at a Christian CD stand along the train tracks. But when she arrives, she finds a slender young man from Honduras who resembles the photograph she carries of her Heriberto but who is not her son. Image copyright Encarni Pindado Pilar Escobar Medina from Honduras is searching for her daughter Olga, with whom she has had only very intermittent contact. One day in September 2009, Olga did not return to her home in Honduras. Fifteen days later she called her mother from the city of Tapachula on the Guatemala-Mexico border, saying she had ""ended up there"". Ms Escobar did not hear from her again until earlier this year, when they planned a reunion. But in the months before they were due to meet, Olga's phone line went dead. ""Before migrants died of thirst, or were bitten by a snake while crossing the desert. Today they die at the hands of organised crime, and our girls, are raped by [people linked to] organised crime"" says Rosa Nelly Santos, who heads a committee for disappeared migrants in Honduras. Image copyright Encarni Pindado Mercedes Lemus (left) is searching for her daughter Ana Victoria, who went disappeared on 16 April, 2010. Last year, a woman in Huixtla told her that she had seen her daughter in a local bar. Neighbours confirmed that the picture of Ana Victoria resembled a woman they had seen around town with the bar's owner. But when Mercedes asked for permission to enter the bar, the bouncer warned her that if she went in, she would not come out alive.

In La Ceiba, a cultural and educational centre working with indigenous communities in Chiapas, the mothers are invited to a Mayan ceremony, a pre-hispanic ritual to connect with ancestors.

Patrick Allan,"The English language is constantly evolving, with new words and phrases spreading among us like an infection—we hear things, then we say those things. The problem is that we don’t always bother to wonder if we should. Because of that, the original meaning of some demeaning and hateful expressions get lost in time. Here are some widely used examples. People will say all kinds of offensive things if they think you share their views. Take, for… Read more Read “Gyp” or “Gypped” or “Jip” or “Jipped” This means to be cheated, swindled, or taken advantage of in modern vernacular, but it’s referring to a very specific subset of people in a very negative way. The word comes from the already offensive term “gypsy,” which is often used to inappropriately, and inaccurately, describe the Romani people. When the Romani moved from India to Europe, they were mistaken for Egyptians because of their dark skin, so they were dubbed “gypsies.” Somewhere along the way, people concluded that all “gypsies” are thieves and swindlers, thus the term “gypped” was born. “No Can Do” and “Long Time No See” Out of all the expressions on this page, you’ve most likely said these at some point. It might be surprising to see these seemingly innocuous phrases on this list, but they’re actually born out of mean-spirited mockery. In the early 20th century, “no can do” and other broken English phrases were a way to make fun of how Chinese immigrants and other ESL people attempted to communicate. The same goes for “long time no see,” which was use to mock Native American Pidgin English speaking patterns. “Paddy Wagon” This is a popular term for those large police vehicles that can hold multiple people who have been arrested. You usually see them around large gatherings and events. If the “Paddy” part of the term hasn’t tipped you off yet (“Paddy” is semi-derogatory slang word for an Irishman), “paddy wagon” refers to those of Irish descent in a negative way. The term likely came about in early 20th century or late 19th century America for one of two reasons. Either it was because many police officers at the time were of Irish descent and drove those wagons, or more likely because so many people of Irish descent were being loaded up into those wagons. For a word that is so firmly a part of American slang, the term ""paddy wagon""—sometimes… Read more Read “Off the Reservation” People use this phrase nowadays to describe someone who is deviating from what is expected of them. Basically, if you’re not doing what you’re supposed to be doing, someone might tell you that “you’re off the reservation right now.” Back in the 19th century, however, it had a very different and specific meaning. As Kee Malesky at NPR explains, the phrase literally referred to Native Americans breaking strict U.S. government rules and leaving their designated reservation land without proper authority. Local authorities would send telegrams with messages along the lines of, “Currently no Indians are off the reservation without authority,” or “We’ve located a band of Indians living off the reservation and plan to arrest them.” “Uppity” This word is often used to describe someone as being arrogant or self-important—like, “Don’t get all uppity on us”—but it has a pretty disturbing history. It was originally a racist term used in the American south to describe black people who didn’t know their place. It was usually part of a two-word descriptor that I’m sure you can guess on your own. “Bugger” You’re more likely to hear this term in Great Britain than the states, where it’s a full-on curse word, but it’s still worth knowing about. The word comes from a heretical religious sect during the Middle Ages called “Bulgarus” who practiced sodomy. Over time, the term transformed into “bulgar” and then “bugger.” Essentially, the word means “Bulgarian sodomite.” The nice thing about getting together with family for the holidays is catching up with loved ones… Read more Read “Sold Down the River” People say something along the lines of “You sold me down the river!” when they’ve been screwed over. The phrase now means to be cheated or betrayed, like when someone gets taken advantage of. But this phrase’s origin is tied to the slave trade in 19th-century America. Slave owners would often sell off troublesome slaves (usually men), literally sending them down the Mississippi river, to plantations with harsher conditions. So, when you say “You sold me down the river!” you’re saying “You’re treating me like a misbehaving slave,” which is most certainly not accurate. If you didn’t know these expressions were racist in origin and have used them in the past, that’s okay. But now that you know, rethink your vernacular and find new ways to express these feelings. Better yet, take this as a reminder to always think about what you say in the future. Before you go repeating something you heard, do some of your own research on the terminology, and cultivate a desire to understand the words that come out of your mouth and flow through your fingers.","The English language is constantly evolving, with new words and phrases spreading among us like an infection—we hear things, then we say those things.

Danny Crichton,"Human resources has to be one of the greatest bait-and-switch professions one can join today. HR departments position themselves with a forward-facing fluffy image, whether improving the productivity of workers through training and development programs or perhaps righting the yawning inequality gap in America by encouraging diverse hiring standards. Unsurprisingly, the field often attracts starry-eyed idealists, people who seek a mission-oriented, perhaps even noble profession for their careers. They join thinking they are going to make a difference. Then the corruption happens. A superior has made a pass at a subordinate, and an executive of the company asks that the subordinate be fired to “clean up” the situation. An employee repeatedly makes homophobic, racist, or sexist remarks to their colleagues, but the company has deemed the individual critical to the functioning of the sales team, and so is merely given a warning. Company morale is suffering and complaints are showing up on online sites like Glassdoor, so HR is charged with “fixing” the company’s rating. A well-performing employee is repeatedly given poor performance reviews to make their firing tidy. Indeed, for a department that — at least theoretically — is designed to communicate well with humans, it is incredible to see how many questions are about procedures that should be entirely transparent for employees. All of these examples are hypothetical, but they are archetypes for the near daily news of HR abuses that are now been regularly published around the world. Susan Fowler’s original memo about Uber, which did more to kick off the reporting about workplace problems faced by women than perhaps any other article, mentions HR seventeen times. At the time, Uber’s HR department may possibly have been the most rogue in the industry, but its behavior certainly resonated outside of that company’s walls. Just as concerns about sexual harassment and other issues has intensified, trust in human resources, and really, the entire executive teams of companies, is reaching a nadir. The Edelman Trust Barometer, which has been studying trust in companies, people, and institutions for almost twenty years, has found that a majority of rank-and-file employees don’t trust their company’s leadership, and worse, less than a quarter believe that their CEO is ethical. As trust has declined, so has the ability of HR to diffuse complicated workplace situations without resorting to its legal toolset. The obvious reality is that HR has never been “your friend.” Rather, it is an important component of a company’s legal strategy to document and mitigate any potential lawsuits that might arise from its employees, contractors, or anyone else who may interact with the firm. Occasionally, that mission might align with friendliness: HR may defuse a fight between two colleagues both to prevent legal troubles as well as to make the workplace more productive. Employees, who might have been leery at interacting with HR before, are now no longer going to HR at all, and are seeking alternative options for advice. Today, there is a growing crop of new apps and services to get peer information, allowing employees to protect themselves like never before. No Longer Blind Few apps have had as much of an impact on workplace communications as Blind, an anonymous social network of current company employees and alums. The app, which was founded in South Korea roughly five years ago, was first launched in the US in late 2015, and since then has seen tremendous success in building footprints at some of the largest and most important American companies. From its homepage, the company says that it has more than 37,000 users from Microsoft, 20,000 users from Amazon and 8,600 users from Google, as well as employees from more than 3,000 other companies on its platform today (at least signed up). While the app spans industries, the tech industry remains the company’s DNA, as the founding team came from Naver, the South Korean search and content giant. a pattern across “hundreds and hundreds” of interviews where an HR worker will become a temporary “double agent” — helping an employee navigate a situation in an off-the-record fashion outside of company policy. One growth challenge that the app has faced and is obvious from App Store reviews is that the app, although anonymous, requires the use of a work email to verify employment. That means that all posts and replies are made by people working at the same company and therefore have the same context to potentially help you. However, many users complain that they really want true anonymity without any connection with their real persona, given their fear of consequences for commenting on company policies. Latest Crunch Report Much like the app Secret, threads on the platform are open to inspection, and the company’s homepage provides a convenient browser to search through them. A huge amount of the topics concern the quotidian procedures of HR, from hiring and recruiting to compensation and promotions. Indeed, for a department that — at least theoretically — is designed to communicate well with humans, it is incredible to see how many questions are about procedures that should be entirely transparent for employees. Perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the most popular topics given the app’s heavy influence in the tech industry is around women in tech. Take a recent thread entitled “ Fired for being pregnant?.” An employee of a company reported that she had recently seen an employee dismissed after she had announced that she was pregnant. The comment quickly garnered a dozen and a half responses. That thread though is a perfect example of the limits of watercooler discussions. Many of the comments are supportive but ultimately useless, such as “This breaks my heart, but doesn’t surprise me, sadly.” from an employee at Sephora or completely unsupportive, such as “This shouldn’t be discrimination.” by an employee at Amazon. An employee at Slack said “Whether you feel comfortable revealing the company name on here or not, please report this company to the EEOC,” which was one of the only actionable pieces of advice in the thread. Bravely Empowering Work Clearly, people want to talk about the problems at their workplace. But venting to anonymous colleagues is about the least effective approach to ameliorating the underlying conditions making workers unhappy in the workforce. That’s why other apps are exploring how to handle difficult conversations at the workplace in a better light, often with the blessing of HR departments themselves. Bravely is one such app. The company, based in New York, was founded by Toby Hervey, Sarah Sheehan, and Rasesh Patel as a platform to facilitate the kinds of hard conversations that need to happen for a workplace to thrive. Their concept is to connect workers who might be struggling bringing up a matter at work with expert “Pros” who are trained executive and life coaches who can help a worker think through their options and how best to raise their voice at a company. HR may be increasingly viewed with distrust as a “corrupt” agent of the corporation, but that view also undermines what is a very necessary function for a healthy workplace: a group of people who can facilitate the politics that will inevitably crop up in even the best corporate cultures. Hervey argued strenuously to me this week that “the healthiest organizations are the ones that are most able to host difficult conversations.” He explained that one of the benefits of Bravely is that the platform can act as a neutral third-party. For HR professionals, “there is a structural challenge with representing employees,” he said, since they are obligated to represent the interests of the company who employees them. That often puts HR workers in a bind, and Hervey has seen a pattern across “hundreds and hundreds” of interviews where an HR worker will become a temporary “double agent” — helping an employee navigate a situation in an off-the-record fashion outside of company policy. Part of having those hard conversations is also putting a mirror to the employee as well. Hervey said that “we are creating a resource for employees, but it is not a union rep, it is not blindly neutral.” Instead, “we are advocates for sometimes challenging on where you are coming from,” helping employees think about the root causes of their problems as well as the macro situation of the firm. Bravely is purchased by companies to be an independent third-party and help people learn and actually hold difficult conversations at work. Hervey said that the app has so far gotten the best traction in companies of 100-350 employees, where HR processes are starting to solidify but the culture around communication may be relatively nascent. The company was founded mid-last year and has raised a $1.5 million seed round from Primary Venture Partners. There are other apps in the space. One example that was funded this week is Loris.ai, which is a for-profit spin out from the New York City-based non-profit Crisis Text Line suicide prevention service. Loris hasn’t launched yet, but did raise a round of venture capital from Floodgate, Kapor Capital, and LinkedIn CEO Jeff Wiener. The goal is to take some of the learnings from Crisis Text Line and apply them to workplace conversations. While venture-scalable startups are one model for this space, other firms are taking a non-profit approach to improving workplace communication and building trust in organizations. Empower Work is one such firm. The non-profit, which is headquartered in San Francisco, was founded by Jaime-Alexis Fowler, who worries that “There are increasing inequalities, and those are translating in pretty profound ways in the workplace.” She conducted a broad survey with workers across demographic groups and industries. What she found was that 95% of workers had faced a “difficult situation” at work, and 78% of those had rated that situation “extremely difficult.” 46% of workers had left their job as a result. The plurality of the situations were interpersonal – challenging situations with colleagues, superiors, or customers which made it hard to move forward with a particular job. Fowler told me that “we found out what people were looking for was human connection that was immediate and anonymous.” She decided to take her findings and try to solve them through Empower Work, which is a service that connects workers with “peer counselors” who can support a worker through a decision. “One of the benefits of being a 501(c)3 is that we have no skin in the game, we are focused entirely on the individual,” Fowler explained, using the tax code’s number for a non-profit organization. “What people reach out to us is personal, but in the context of something professional. We offer a space in order to grapple with whatever that is.” The top three questions that come into Empower Work are fear of being fired, sexual harassment, and decisions in the everyday work of a job. Fowler has specifically targeted under-represented groups, and she said (based on self-identified demographic reports) that the company hears predominantly from women and people of color. Fowler explained that for these groups, they often have lower levels of social capital and relationships in a workplace, making work challenges both harder to handle due to a lack of peer support as well as having “dramatically worse outcomes” if they are not improved. Fowler also noted the changing nature of the role of HR in our conversation. “There has always been this tension in the role that HR provides — they are straddling the employer and the employees. It is a very uncomfortable place to be,” she said. “When there is this distrust of the corporation … there is this inherent discomfort of going to them for resources.” Fowler noted that many of the employees that come to Empower Work work at smaller employers without established HR departments, and so that avenue isn’t even an option. The Death and Rebirth of HR That ultimately gets at one of the largest long-term challenges of the changing American economy. As the number of freelancers and gig economy workers skyrocket, the very design of HR today seems entirely out-of-sync with the changes that are happening in the labor markets. Tens of millions of workers are employed by small employers with no HR department, and tens of millions more workers are employed as 1099 contractors with limited access to HR resources. HR may be increasingly viewed with distrust as a “corrupt” agent of the corporation, but that view also undermines what is a very necessary function for a healthy workplace: a group of people who can facilitate the politics that will inevitably crop up in even the best corporate cultures. Learning how to handle a difficult conversation while also fearing employment loss is not a skill learned in high school or college. There clearly is a need for more network-based HR resources that can be responsive to worker concerns in real-time. Companies like Blind, Bravely, Loris.ai, and non-profits like Empower Work are just the tip of the spear into what is a growing reform of the HR profession. The two-faced HR role of the past no longer matches the needs of workers today. Employees realize this, and now, it is time that HR departments accept that reality as well.

Sarah Perez,"Lost-item finder Tile announced today that it will soon be able to locate your Bose headphones. Starting in late spring 2018, Bose will become one of Tile’s biggest new partners, as it will begin to sell its Bose SoundSport Wireless and QuietControl 30 headphones with Tile’s technology embedded inside. Existing devices will receive the new feature as a firmware update – the first time that Tile’s software has been downloaded into devices already in users’ homes, in fact. Once installed, Tile’s app can locate the Bose headphones as it would any other Tile device. You can “ring” the headphones to find them using the app, and the volume will progressively get louder the longer it rings. Of course, Tile today continues to be best known for its keychain-style square dongles that can be attached to items you want to keep track of – like your keys, purse, bag, bike, wallet and more. But the company’s larger goal has always been to create a global community of users who become the backbone of a distributed network that can be tapped into at anytime to help locate missing items. To date, Tile has sold 13 million devices, giving it a 90 percent share in the “lost item finder” market, according to NPD. Its community now spans 230 countries and territories worldwide and is used to find over 2 million items per day. Tile also reported $100 million in revenue in 2016. The addition of Bose comes alongside the announcement of several new partners that have confirmed plans to integrate Tile into their products. Other new additions include Samsonite, which will make luggage that doesn’t get lost; Propeller Health, which will add Tile’s technology to its connected inhalers for people with asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Boosted, which will add Tile to its Boosted Boards; plus baby wearable maker Starling; and Herschel, which makes wallets, keychain holders and passport holders. These join existing partners, like Away Travel, SuitSupply, Blunt Umbrellas, G-RO, This is Ground, Fossil, Kenneth Cole, Ricardo Beverly Hills, Axiom, Nomad, Keysmart, and Keyline/Bianca. Tile is also adding a range of access points partnerships to expand its network, thanks to deals with Comcast, Ruckus Networks, and San Jose International Airport. The airport deal went live in November 2017 and Tile says it’s already seen a 20 percent increase in same-day found rates, bringing the rate to 95 percent. “It’s exciting to see the Tile community grow exponentially, not only with more consumers but also with leading brands and even locations,” said Mike Farley, CEO and Co-Founder of Tile, in a statement. “Airports are just the beginning. We’re looking at all high-traffic areas where things that matter to us are commonly lost – hotels and malls, as well as homes and neighborhoods. With these key partnerships, we truly are blanketing the world with smart location.” The new partnerships announced today will kick off in spring 2018, with Bose’s integrations and Samsonite’s global pilot.","Lost-item finder Tile announced today that it will soon be able to locate your Bose headphones.

US singer Katy Perry, the most-followed user on Twitter, and Lady Gaga lost about 2.5 million followers. Barack Obama went down 2.1 million. Twitter said it had taken the decision due to its ""ongoing and global effort to build trust"". It follows renewed scrutiny over fake news and users on social media. The new measures mean that any user whose account is locked for unusual activity - such as being blocked or sending unusual volumes of Tweets - and who did not respond to a prompt to verify their identity would be excluded from Twitter follower counts. The head of the company's legal team, Vijaya Gadde, said that most accounts would only lose around four followers as a result of the new measures. But she warned that more popular accounts would ""experience a more significant drop"".

Sarah Perez,"Lost device finder Tile today is making good on its previously announced partnership with Comcast by introducing a way for Comcast Xfinity customers to locate their Tiles using Comcast’s TV remote, the Xfinity X1 Voice Remote. This is also the first video and voice partnership with Tile, which has been steadily expanding its integrations with third parties, including most recently Bose, Samsonite, Boosted Boards, and others. The company has said its goal is to “blanket the world” in smart location through its partnerships, which have also included those with access points and airport Wi-Fi. With the Comcast partnership in particular, Tile users can speak into their voice remote and ask for the location of one of their Tiles – the small dongles that can be attached to things like bags, purses, keys, wallets and more. To use this feature, you have to say “Xfinity Home,” (yes, this is how you talk to your remote), “where are my keys?” or “Sam’s backpack?” or whatever other label you’ve assigned your Tile device. The last known location and the address of the missing Tile will then appear on the TV screen. To use the feature, Xfinity customers will have to download the Xfinity Home app on their iOS or Android device to add their Tiles following the instructions in the app. The companies say that, later this year, the feature will become available to all Xfinity Internet customers, too. Though there are a number of lost item finders on the market, Tile has become one of the biggest in the space, having sold 13 million Tiles to date, as of this January. It hasn’t provided an update on revenue in recent months, but said it had earned $100 million in 2016. One the company’s bigger efforts lately has been on expanding its network. Tiles work beyond their Bluetooth connections by creating a community where all users with the Tile app on their phone can share information back to the network about nearby Tiles, including those from other users. That means it’s to Tile’s advantage to integrate its technology in as many places and products as possible – as this brings on more customers, and more places where nearby Tiles can be found. Comcast was one of several new partnerships announced this year, but it was one of the bigger names. The other notable brand working with Tile now is Bose, whose SoundSport Wireless and QuietControl 30 headphones will ship with Tile’s technology embedded inside.","Lost device finder Tile today is making good on its previously announced partnership with Comcast by introducing a way for Comcast Xfinity customers to locate their Tiles using Comcast’s TV remote, the Xfinity X1 Voice Remote.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Elon Musk has complained before about ""negative propaganda"" Elon Musk's bombshell announcement that he is thinking of taking the electric car company Tesla private has landed him a lawsuit from unhappy investors. The American entrepreneur said on Tuesday that de-listing from the stock exchange could be the ""best path forward"" for the firm. His comments caused the share price to shoot up 11% to nearly $380 (£298), though it has since fallen back. Short-sellers, who bet on share price falls, allege he misled the market. Mr Musk, Tesla's founder and chief executive, announced that he might take the company private in a deal worth $72 billion, valuing the company at $420 a share. However, he did not specify exactly where the money for such a deal, which would be the largest of its kind for more than a decade, would come from. Mr Musk, who owns a fifth of the company, has complained previously about ""negative propaganda"" from short-sellers. He said he hoped taking the firm private would protect Tesla from the distractions of share price volatility and pressure to meet quarterly financial targets. Short-sellers, who make a profit by borrowing shares, selling them and then buying them back at an expected lower price, claim to have lost millions thanks to Mr Musk's comments. Plaintiff Kalman Isaacs alleges the announcement was aimed at ""completely decimating"" short-sellers. His lawsuit, and another filed by William Chamberlain, accuse Mr Musk and Tesla of violating federal securities laws and artificially inflating Tesla's share price. Neither Mr Musk nor Tesla have commented on the lawsuit, which was filed in a federal court in San Francisco. The tech entrepreneur is no stranger to controversy. Only last month he was forced to apologise for insulting a British diver involved in rescuing a youth football team from a cave in northern Thailand.","Short-sellers say they've lost millions after ""misleading"" comments about going private.",2018-08-11T10:11:01Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Tesla's Elon Musk faces investor lawsuit,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45155268,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5805/production/_102933522_mediaitem102933521.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,lost,1

But what if there was another screenplay by the late, great director? Lost for decades? That is exactly what film professor Nathan Abrams has uncovered. ""To find a whole screenplay after 60 years - that's fantastic,"" said the Bangor University expert. Prof Abrams said he made the discovery about the script to the unmade film Burning Secret while researching a new book on Kubrick's last film - Eyes Wide Shut. ""The son of a Kubrick collaborator, who wishes to remain anonymous at this time, has shown me a copy,"" said the professor, director of research at the north Wales university's School of Creative Studies and Media. ""It seemingly checks out. It's most likely that said collaborator was going to work on the film had it been green-lit."" The film scholar, who has a special interest in transatlantic Jewish film history, culture and politics, said biographies and archives about Kubrick referred to the screenplay. ""What nobody knew was whether they had actually written a script and finished it - and now we know the answer to that question and we have a complete screenplay,"" said Prof Abrams. ""Making a new discovery is difficult in this area, even though his archive in London has opened-up - a lot of it is re-interpretational, discovering a document here or there."" Image caption Kubrick behind the camera on the set of Full Metal Jacket Burning Secret was an adaptation of a 1913 novella by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig, written by Kubrick in 1956 with novelist Calder Willingham. It tells the story of a suave insurance salesman befriending a 10-year-old boy, so he is able seduce the child's mother. Prof Abrams said the screenplay takes an original Viennese Jewish novel and translates it to Kubrick's contemporary America. ""I would argue that what we can see draws a direct link between this film, between Lolita, Barry Lyndon, The Shining and culminating in Eyes Wide Shut,"" said Prof Abrams. ""Elements of this film, although it didn't get made, have fed into his other films. ""We can trace his thought over 40 years.""

The professor rejects that suggestion. ""He worked on this and he was really excited about this, according to his producing partner at the time, James B Harris"", he said. ""It was the studio that nixed the project. ""Was it any good? I mean Stanley thought so, he worked on it.

Last week, the family of five were thrilled to get a call saying the German Shepherd was alive, having crossed the border from Germany to Switzerland. Rapunzel the dog was found 400km (250m) away, beside a road near Zurich. The eight-year-old pet was seriously injured, but is now recovering at an animal hospital. Two Swiss paramedics were returning to Zurich in the middle of the night when they noticed a large motionless animal on the edge of the motorway. Thought to have been hit by a car, Rapunzel, now very thin, was suffering from hypothermia and wary of the humans approaching. Realising they could not wait for an animal ambulance to arrive, the emergency responders provided first aid, blankets and oxygen to the canine before rushing her to the University of Zurich's animal hospital, said a city press release. She has been treated for fractured bones and internal bleeding. Her owners, who drove down to see Rapunzel at the weekend, said the dog was skilled at opening doors and escaped during a trip to the local vet on 15 August. ""She had never run away before,"" owner Jasmin Ehret-Vath told local news source Main-Echo, adding that the dog was usually known to be lazy. A search operation was launched on social media and the family would rush to remote places if any possible sightings were reported.

In recent years, the reef has lost 30% of its coral due to bleaching linked to rising sea temperatures and damage from crown-of-thorns starfish. The funding will be used to reduce the runoff of agricultural pesticides and improve water quality. Some of the money will be used to help farmers near the reef modify their practices. Threats to the reef include ""large amounts of sediment, nitrogen and pesticide run-off"" as well as the crown-of-thorns starfish species, Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg said. The reef can be seen from space and was listed as a world heritage site in 1981 by the United Nations cultural body Unesco. There are 1,052 sites of environmental and cultural importance such as the reef on Unesco's World Heritage List. In 2017, the organisation decided not to place the Great Barrier Reef on its official list of 55 World Heritage sites ""in danger"". Unprecedented coral bleaching in recent years has caused damage to two-thirds of the reef, aerial surveys in 2017 showed. Image copyright EPA Image caption Crown-of-thorns starfish feed on coral in the Great Barrier Reef Crown-of-thorns starfish are one of the most damaging creatures affecting tropical coral reefs as they are voracious predators that release the contents of their stomach on to the coral. Digestive juices then liquify the coral ready for consumption. A single individual starfish can wipe out large areas of a reef. The reef is actually a vast collection of thousands of smaller coral reefs stretching from the northern tip of Queensland to the state's southern city of Bundaberg. Conservationists have welcomed the extra funding, but said the government needed to focus on climate change. ""You cannot 'preserve' the Great Barrier Reef without cutting carbon emissions. That means no new coal, oil or gas,"" Greenpeace Australia Pacific's CEO said on Twitter. However, Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop told Australian news outlets was a world leader in managing and protecting its reef.

In the next five weeks leading up to the runoff in April, both Ms. Lightfoot and Ms. Preckwinkle are expected to battle over the meaning of the term progressive in a heavily Democratic city.
Ms. Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor and former president of the Chicago Police Board, an oversight group, is not far apart ideologically from Ms. Preckwinkle on many of the issues facing the city.
But she is trying to define herself as the true progressive in the race partly by highlighting Ms. Preckwinkles time in government, especially her relationship with Ed Burke, a Chicago alderman who has been charged with attempted extortion and held a fund-raiser for Ms. Preckwinkle. She returned the money and stripped Mr. Burke of his role as chairman of a county committee. (In things that havent changed when it comes to Chicago elections, Mr. Burke was re-elected on Tuesday despite facing a criminal charge.)
Ms. Preckwinkle has indicated that she will fight to hold onto the label. Im the most progressive candidate in this race, and Ive taken my progressive values to whatever job Ive taken on, she said in a debate last month.
On Tuesday night, she reflected on Chicagos shifting political order. I remember when progressive wasnt a positive, she said. It was at best a euphemism for unelectable.

RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and THOMAS FULLER,"By now, Mr. Feith said, at many crash sites the wreckage will have been hoisted onto trucks, often after being cut into pieces, and shipped to storage facilities.
There, agency investigators will sift through the pieces, not always knowing which fractures and fatigue happened before the crash, which were caused by the crash, and which were caused by moving the wreckage afterward.
They may not be able to decipher what is an artifact of the accident, versus what is an artifact of the post-accident recovery, Mr. Feith said.
Moreover, another key evidence collection requests for air traffic control data normally made quickly after a crash may not be possible in some cases. A lot of that information is lost in the abyss, he said.
The significance of getting investigators to accident sites speedily is underscored by how the safety agency organizes its inquiries: A Go Team of rotating experts fly immediately to the most significant crash sites. They are on call 24 hours a day, with a bag of audio recorders, cameras, flashlights, screwdrivers, wrenches or other tools at the ready.
The importance of being on site as soon as possible is why the agency is structured the way it is, said Mr. Hall, the former agency chairman.

LEIGH ELSTON,"But being better than coal is a low bar and is not enough for a stable climate, said Jonathan Gaventa, a senior associate at the sustainable development think tank E3G, who recently moved to Maputo. Both coal and gas power generation are also beginning to be challenged by low-cost renewable resources.
That doesnt change the fact that Mozambique needs the money. But will it really improve the lives of ordinary people?
I saw one attendee leave the presentation early. I had this awkward feeling with thousands of deaths and the emergency, and I am here discussing who gets the biggest piece of the cake, he told me later.
Weak state institutions and low government accountability make Mozambique vulnerable to the resource curse when a dependence on natural-resource revenues leads to higher rates of conflict and corruption and a decline in democracy and economic growth.
The conflict has already begun. Since October 2017, Islamist insurgents have been attacking villages, burning houses and decapitating residents in Cabo Delgado. Little is understood about the cause of this violence, but rising poverty and inequality are thought to be at its root. The gas projects will further disrupt the areas economic balance.
The government has cracked down with mass arrests. Human Rights Watch has reported that the security forces have allegedly arbitrarily detained, ill-treated and summarily executed dozens of people they suspected of belonging to the insurgency.
Since Cyclone Idai hit, the insurgency has dropped from the headlines, aided by the fact that the governor of Cabo Delgado has reportedly ordered journalists to stop covering the conflict. At least two journalists have been detained for doing so.",The money could make the country more resilient — if it’s not lost to conflict and corruption first.,2019-03-26T16:01:40Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Can Exxon Mobil Protect Mozambique From Climate Change?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/opinion/cyclone-idai-mozambique-climate-change.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/26/opinion/26elston1/26elston1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1
MARC TRACY,"The greatest Cavalier ever, Ralph Sampson, was a three-time college player of the year and a No. 1 overall N.B.A. draft pick who took Virginia to a Final Four but never won a conference tournament. His teams were stymied by the great Tar Heels squads of Michael Jordan and James Worthy, and by North Carolina States miracle national champions of 1983.
As the Cavaliers have won or shared four regular-season A.C.C. titles during the last several years under Bennett, there has been a string of N.C.A.A. tournament disappointments. Last years loss was the third time Virginia had been defeated as a No. 1 seed.
Part of their depression, for lack of a better word, Jerry Ratcliffe, a longtime local sports journalist, said, referring to the fans, went back to when they lost to a really good Michigan State team in Madison Square Garden a few years ago, and they felt like that team was Final Four material. And the collapse against Syracuse a couple years ago that definitely was a Final Four team.
Then, too, there was the style of last years defeat. Virginia found itself trailing early in the second half, and Bennetts team, famous for a careful, slow style of play that critics say makes it susceptible to upsets, failed to erase the deficit.
Now you have to hear it forever, said Tyler Pearson, another patron at the restaurant to watch the regular season finale. Everything they said is true: The system doesnt work; if you fall behind, you cant come back; Tony is stubborn.
This years Cavaliers are almost certainly better than the team that lost to U.M.B.C. They had just two regular-season losses, both to Duke, the tournaments top overall seed. They retained most of their leading players from last season while adding Braxton Key, a transfer from Alabama, and the freshman Kihei Clark. DeAndre Hunter, a sophomore who did not play in the U.M.B.C. game because of a broken wrist, might be this seasons national player of the year if Dukes Zion Williamson did not exist.

CHARLIE SAVAGE,"On Thursday, Mr. Wolosky wrote to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, asking him to reject a request by Iran for assistance in turning back the victim families request that Iranian assets in Italy be frozen. The letter cited a 2014 Italian constitutional court ruling that the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not protect violators of human rights from lawsuits.
The case is raising an important test of the legislative spree that Congress went on after the Sept. 11 attacks to carve out a terrorism exception to sovereign immunity, said Harold Hongju Koh, a Yale Law School professor of international law who served as the State Departments top lawyer in the Obama administration. Other countries did not follow suit, either in law and practice.
Everyone knew a case would come along that exposes the divergence between a more limited set of restrictions on sovereign immunity held globally and the United States emerging position on non-immunity for various kinds of terrorist acts, he said. This case has exposed that seam.
The case in Luxembourg has been closely watched not only by other victims of terrorist attacks holding similar default judgments, but by diplomats and security officials as well. Critics have raised concerns that if it succeeds, it would undermine the nuclear deal by making it harder for Iran to reintegrate into the world economy, strengthening the hand of hard-liners in Tehran who want to abandon the accord.
The ruling, if it holds, could help persuade Iran to adhere to the nuclear deal despite the Trump administrations reimposition of sanctions, said Payam Mohseni, the director of the Iran Project at Harvard Kennedy Schools Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Through the Luxembourg court ruling, the Iranians will be gauging how viable continued engagement with the West will be in the future, particularly with the Europeans, he said. If Iranian assets are threatened in Europe, the value of staying in the nuclear agreement is significantly diminished for Iran.
But the Luxembourg ruling is also a setback to efforts to make it easier for victims of terrorist attacks to win compensation that have been more successful inside the United States.",Victims of the Sept. 11 attacks lost a ruling in a case that brought to a head a long growing disagreement about a significant question of international law.,2019-03-28T23:26:34Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",European Court Rules Against 9/11 Victims Seeking $1.6 Billion From Iran,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/us/politics/iran-september-11th-victims.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/28/us/politics/28dc-iran/28dc-iran-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The straw lobby has lost the capitalists. Just a few weeks after Starbucks announced it was eliminating plastic straws, Disney has said it’s doing the same. By the middle of next year, the Magic Kingdom will be plastic straw- and stirrer-free at every location except Disney Tokyo. The company said doing so would eliminate an annual total of more than 175 million straws and 13 million stirrers, though it didn’t announce what would replace them. “Eliminating plastic straws and other plastic items are meaningful steps in our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship,” Bob Chapek, the chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences, and Consumer Products said in a statement. “These new global efforts help reduce our environmental footprint, and advance our long-term sustainability goals.” The company also announced it will be moving to use refillable room amenities on its cruises and in its hotels, though it provided no timeframe aside from “over the next few years.” They claim that move would reduce plastics in guest rooms by 80 percent. Plastic bags are also on blast as are styrofoam cups. Bans on straws are becoming de rigueur for large corporations, municipalities, and countries around the world. This is all well and good since plastic is suffocating the oceans (including the freaking high Arctic !). But there are a few tiny issues before we write this off as a happy ending. It’s a small world and we’re producing way more plastic than it can hold beyond straws, which make up just a tiny portion of the plastic entering the high seas.

DAVID BROOKS,"Your next job is to help them cope. People contemplating suicide are often in the grips of a temporary mood catastrophe, to which they unfortunately see a permanent solution.
The pain is real but not forever. Most people who attempt suicide and fail are later glad they failed. Get them to talk about the pain, so they can understand its contours. Ask them to journal their thoughts. Over time most of them will see that there is a compulsive voice in their head telling them that they are worthless and that there is no hope, and that this voice is a lying voice.
The voice may be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. Ask them to write down a life plan for those moments when the lying voice gets loudest: Who will they call? Where will they go? Hang the contact information right on the wall. Dont let such a person swear you to secrecy. Youre going to find more help. Try anti-suicide apps, like Tec-Tec, available through Apple or Amazon.
We also need to go broader. Suicide is a societal problem. Its strongly associated with social isolation. Men die at higher rates than women, single people more than married people, rural people more than urban people, Native Americans and whites more than blacks or Latinos.
Its also a values problem. Our individualistic culture means there are vast empty gaps in our social fabric where people suffer alone and invisible. Its also a guns problem. A lot of people die simply because at their lowest moment, there happened to be a gun around.
Agnes wrote to me that if you meet someone who has lost someone to suicide, there are better ways to begin a conversation. SAY THEIR LOVED ONES NAME! Share a memory. When you ask how the survivor is doing, dont let her say, Its not about me. Because it is, and about her recovery.
Agnes believes in professional help but says whats really necessary is belonging and peer counseling, people pouring their heart out, and it creates the mentality that, if they can do it, I can do it. Give folks a feeling of hope that we can rise out of this and we can do it together.
Her life has been messy, like a lot of lives, but Agnes has a hard-earned wisdom. I woke back up after losing Harrison on Dec. 28, 2015. I was sitting on my front porch talking to Harrison like I still do. I said, Gosh darn it, Harrison, didnt you know how much I loved you! I felt him move through me.

SCOTT REYBURN,"The “Director” catalog had “multiple functions,” according to Femke Speelberg, co-curator of the exhibition, “Chippendale’s ‘Director’: The Designs and Legacy of a Furniture Maker,” which is on show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York through Jan. 27, 2019. The exhibition features a selection of the more than 200 original Chippendale drawings owned by the museum. “It was advertising for the Chippendale firm,” Ms. Speelberg said about the catalog. “It directed the tastes of the gentleman classes. And it was a source of inspiration for design more broadly.” The title page of the 1754 first edition of Thomas Chippendale’s “The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker’s Director.” Credit The Metropolitan Museum of Art Helped by this marketing masterstroke, Chippendale became 18th-century England’s most celebrated and sought-after furniture maker. But how is his fame faring? The Victoria and Albert Museum, Britain’s premier collection devoted to decorative arts, has not marked the tercentenary of Chippendale’s birth with an exhibition. Instead, it has been left to the Chippendale Society in Yorkshire, the part of northern England where the furniture maker was born, to coordinate a calendar of “ Chippendale 300 ” events at regional museums and country houses. “The name doesn’t mean that much to people anymore,” said Adam Bowett, chairman of the society. “We wanted to extend awareness and appreciation of his work.” Part of the problem is that though Chippendale was — according to Ms. Speelberg of the Met — “the first cabinet maker to have a comprehensive style named after him,” many find it difficult to identify that style nowadays. The popularity of the “Director” encouraged a host of imitators. And because 18th-century English makers, unlike their French counterparts, did not necessarily sign furniture, it can be difficult to verify original pieces from the Chippendale workshop. Mr. Bowett said that so far more than 800 pieces had been securely attributed. And then there is the “brown furniture” problem. Generally speaking, English 18th-century furniture has fallen out of collecting fashion, giving way to a more minimal, contemporary look.","After years of commanding high prices, the British furniture maker’s ornate pieces have lost some luster at the tercentenary of his birth.",2018-07-27T16:46:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Chippendale at 300: A Stellar Brand in Need of Polish,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/arts/design/chippendale-300-furniture.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/01/arts/01reyburn6/merlin_140637864_b7c9df35-6531-4e0c-8628-4ae177a18347-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1
Jennings Brown,"The University of California, Berkeley, lost a beloved member of their campus last week, when a delivery robot was engulfed in flames outside the student union. There are about 100 Kiwibots in the university area. The courier rovers started delivering food to students about two years ago. The service seems to have been operating relatively smoothly until last Friday when a Kiwibot spontaneously combusted while on the job. Campus bystanders captured video and photos of the incident. Yeah, a Kiwibot just caught on fire randomly. Funny as fuck, said the person filming the below video. This is a fun thing to see on your last day of finals, huh kids? Kiwi addressed the incident in a blog post, saying it takes full responsibility for our Kiwibots and explaining what happened: one of the batteries for our robot that was idling started smouldering [sic], eventually leading to some smoke and minor flames. The post states that someone extinguished the flames with a fire extinguisher. Soon the Berkeley Fire Department arrived and covered the toasted bot in firefighting foam. Kiwi said its operations team attended to the robot as soon as it found out about the fire. The company then suspended services for all Kiwibots in operation and had all placed orders delivered by hand. After an investigation, the company revealed the root cause was human error when replacing the batteries, where a defective battery was put in place of a functioning one. This caused an exceedingly rare occurrence of the battery experiencing thermal runaway. The company said it has since incorporated software that monitors batteries. According to student newspaper the Daily Californian, students posting about the lost comrade on Facebook referred to it as a hero and a legend.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The silent film shows Jewish characters being abused in the street and forced from their homes. Credit: Filmarchiv Austria A silent film from 1924 predicting the rise of Nazism was found in a Paris flea market in 2015 after being lost for decades. Thanks to a huge fundraising campaign, it has now been restored and returned to cinemas, reports the BBC's Bethany Bell in Vienna. An Orthodox Jew is set upon by three taunting men. A woman shopping at a market stall becomes outraged at the high prices. She starts pelting a passing Jewish man with fruit. Later, huge protesting crowds gather outside the chancellor's office. Inside, the leader consults with an adviser. ""It is awful to expel the Jews,"" he says. ""But one must satisfy the people."" The incidents portrayed in the Austrian film The City Without Jews (Die Stadt Ohne Juden) are eerily prophetic. It was made nearly 20 years before the Holocaust, at a time when the Nazi party was banned in Austria, and when Adolf Hitler was in jail in Germany, working on his book Mein Kampf. 'Growing anti-Semitism' The film tells the story of a city that expels all of its Jews. They are made the scapegoats for rising prices and unemployment. Image copyright Filmarchiv Austria Image caption The book and film aimed to combat intolerance It is based on a dystopian, satirical novel by the Austrian Jewish writer and journalist, Hugo Bettauer. ""At the beginning of the 1920s, just after Austria's First Republic was founded, political anti-Semitism was growing incredibly, much more than during the monarchy,"" says Nikolaus Wostry, director of collections at the Filmarchiv Austria. Bettauer was trying to combat rising intolerance and racism, at a time when Jews displaced after World War One were arriving in Vienna. ""Hugo Bettauer was a person who really tried to make society more tolerant - towards Jews, towards homosexuals, toward women taking part in political life,"" says Mr Wostry. ""That all brought him into big conflicts with the right wing in Austrian society, which was quite dominant at that time."" 'Grotesque' murder Adapted for the screen by Austrian director HK Breslauer, the City Without Jews premiered in Vienna in 1924. The film was a success, screened in the five biggest cinemas in Vienna, Mr Wostry says. ""But then the political right reacted against it."" Image copyright Filmarchiv Austria Image caption Anti-Semitism in Austria was growing at the time the film was made Less than a year after the film was made, Hugo Bettauer was killed by a Nazi, called Otto Rothstock, following a hate campaign against him. ""His private address was published and in the newspapers, it was explicitly said that such a person shouldn't be part of society."" Mr Wostry says the court case against Rothstock was ""grotesque"". The murderer escaped with a very short sentence. Desperate goodbyes Watching it now, the film's scenes of the expulsion are some of the most haunting and prescient. The city's Jews are told to leave by Christmas Day. Some of the poorer people leave on foot, accompanied by soldiers with bayonets. Whole communities walk slowly through the snow, some on crutches, some carrying Torah scrolls from the synagogues. Others leave by train. Desperate goodbyes take place on the platforms. A Jewish father embraces his little daughter, who is staying behind with her Christian mother. Image copyright Filmarchiv Austria Image caption Families are forced to separate as Jews are expelled in the fictional imagining In reality, some six million Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe were rounded up and killed in the Holocaust. Many others fled abroad. One of the actors in the film, Hans Moser, one of Austria's most famous film stars at the time, was married to a Jewish woman. When the Nazis took over in 1938, he refused to divorce her, writing personally to Adolf Hitler, who was one of his biggest fans, asking for clemency. She eventually emigrated to Hungary and they were reunited after the war. Meanwhile, the film itself went missing as silent films fell from favour. ""At the end of the silent period, silent films couldn't be distributed any longer and the only way to make a profit was to destroy them and to take the silver, to use the plastic,"" says Mr Wostry. ""Worldwide 90% of our silent film heritage is lost."" 'Growing relevance' An incomplete and very damaged version was found in the Netherlands in 1991. Then in 2015, the whole film was rediscovered by a collector in a flea-market in Paris. The Austrian Film Archive organised a crowd-funding campaign to save it. More than 700 people contributed more than €86,000 (£72,000; $107,000) to it. The film has now been digitally restored and re-released. Image caption Nikolaus Wostry says the movie should be considered ""one of the strongest anti-Nazi-statements of the silent film period"" It is being screened in Vienna before going on a tour around Austria and reaching European cities including London later this year, where audiences will be able to watch it accompanied by a new score performed live. Nikolaus Wostry says the movie should be considered ""one of the strongest anti-Nazi-statements of the silent film period"". In the film, after the Jews leave, the city celebrates with fireworks. But life soon gets worse. International trade and the economy suffer, and the city's beloved cafes get turned into simple beer halls. The chancellor eventually invites the Jews back home. Lovers and mixed Christian and Jewish families are reunited. ""It is a statement against excluding people on the grounds of their religion or race from society and has in this respect a growing relevance again for our time,"" says Mr Wostry.","A 1924 silent movie rediscovered in a Paris flea market is back in cinemas after a restoration campaign, reports the BBC's Bethany Bell in Vienna.",2018-03-28T23:58:36Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",'Lost' film predicting rise of Nazism returns to screen,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43569919,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p062lwkc.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,lost,1

Matt Novak,"Cryptocurrency investor Michael Terpin is understandably upset that he lost a combined $24 million in two different hacks of his phone over the course of seven months. Terpin alleges that the hacks were only possible because the hackers had an inside person at AT&amp;T who provided access to Terpin’s account. And he’s suing the telecommunications giant for both the money he lost and $200 million in punitive damages. “The wheels of justice grind slowly, but we made really good-faith efforts to get a settlement out of court,” Terpin told Gizmodo this morning over the phone. “But we feel that AT&amp;T is absolutely at fault here.” Terpin thought he was playing it safe, employing two-factor authentication on everything and even consulting security experts to make sure that nobody could access his accounts. But all of that apparently doesn’t mean much if an employee on the inside gives up your digital identity. Especially as criminal gangs allegedly use LinkedIn to find people who work at AT&amp;T stores and recruit them to help with a hack, whether they know it or not, which is what Terpin says happened to him. Terpin’s lawsuit dubs the attacks against him “SIM swap fraud,” which involves thieves gaining access to mobile customers’ private information, including their phone numbers, and in turn making it possible to take over a target’s phone. From the complaint : After the hackers took charge of Mr. Terpin’s telephone number, the hackers accessed Mr. Terpin’s telephone to divert texts and telephone calls to gain access to Mr. Terpin’s cryptocurrency accounts. The hackers also used the phone to hijack Mr. Terpin’s Skype account to impersonate him. By that means, the hackers convinced a client of Mr. Terpin to send them cryptocurrency and diverted a payment due to Mr. Terpin to themselves. AT&amp;T finally cut off access by the hackers to Mr. Terpin’s telephone number on June 11, 2017, but only after the hackers had stolen substantial funds from Mr. Terpin. Moreover, because of the hack, Mr. Terpin expended a substantial amount of time investigating the hack and attempting to repair his computer accounts. Terpin says that these large cryptocurrency hacks are often perpetrated by “college kids who go online in these Discord groups” to organize their heists. “The one thing that’s been a link between [crypto hacks] is that in every case they’ve had an insider,” Terpin told Gizmodo. “[Trading cryptocurrencies] is safe as long as nobody gives out your digital identity.” Terpin says he’s been in contact with the FBI, Homeland Security, and the U.S. Secret Service and claims they’ve found the AT&amp;T employee whom they believe assisted in the hacks. “What AT&amp;T did was like a hotel giving a thief with a fake ID a room key and a key to the room safe to steal jewelry in the safe from the rightful owner,” the complaint says. The lawsuit continues: “AT&amp;T is doing nothing to protect its almost 140 million customers from SIM card fraud. AT&amp;T is therefore directly culpable for these attacks because it is well aware that its customers are subject to SIM swap fraud and that its security measures are ineffective. AT&amp;T does virtually nothing to protect its customers from such fraud because it has become too big to care.” Terpin approached AT&amp;T in February and hashed things out as best they could with a federal mediator, but the two parties couldn’t come to a settlement. Terpin says that AT&amp;T more or less told him that they’re not responsible for him getting hacked. AT&amp;T did not yet return Gizmodo’s request for comment. Terpin comes from the news business, having started out at small newspapers in his 20s during the early 1980s and eventually making his money founding the Los Angeles-based PR firm Internet Wire (now Marketwired) in the 1990s. Terpin sold out to private equity firms before Marketwired landed a permanent home at NASDAQ in 2016. He’s now an angel investor in a number of different crypto-based start-ups. Terpin, for his part, doesn’t give out his phone number to anyone, as just one more step to hopefully avoid getting hacked in the future. “I now pretty much only give people my Google Voice [number],” Terpin said.

MARGARET COKER,"Social workers say there are thousands more in other towns and provinces liberated from the Islamic State. They say that 20,000 would be a conservative estimate for the total. The number includes children who have lost just one parent, who Iraqis also classify as orphans because single parents in this culture cannot simultaneously serve as breadwinner and caregiver. Most of these children have since been placed with their extended families. Dozens of such families interviewed in Mosul say they are overwhelmed by this duty, lacking the services of social workers, money for medical care and support for their own emotional traumas as survivors of war. They search, often in vain, for help from underfunded government agencies, and local charities. Those without any family are left at the Mosul orphanage, a government shelter that the Islamic State had appropriated as an austere barracks for teenage soldiers when it ruled Mosul. This spring, the orphanage director, Ghazwan Muhammad, and his staff of seven social workers, nurses and cooks reopened the home to give 50 children a place to live. They spent months without pay transforming the buildings, painting the nursery bright colors, canvassing businesses for donations of toys and blankets, and trucking in new playground equipment. They started to receive government funding in June. The orphans there include children of victims of the Islamic State, like Muhammad, as well as the children of members of the Islamic State, also known by its Arabic acronym, Daesh.

JOHN LELAND,"She did. They were in file cabinets under the 79th Street Boat Basin, which was run by the Parks Department, where she worked as a public relations aide. It was the break that made the book possible. Ms. Nichols, in turn, went on to run the WNYC Communications Group. And the rest is a 1,246-page biography, a Pulitzer Prize and perhaps the clearest look at New York’s true power structure ever written. During the battle against Robert Moses, The Voice found another powerful and useful enemy: Carmine DeSapio, then the boss of Tammany Hall, the collection of political clubs that ran the local Democratic Party. DeSapio, known as the Bishop, was the face (and the ever-present sunglasses) of an old Democratic machine and the old, Italian-American Greenwich Village; The Voice represented the new Village Independent Democrats. “It was the new hippie Greenwich Village versus the old Italian Greenwich Village,” said Clark Whelton, 81, who started writing for The Voice in 1968. The paper stepped lightly at first, especially when DeSapio tendered some support in the battle over Washington Square. Then in 1959, one of DeSapio’s minions made the fight personal. “We’re going to put you out of business,” he threatened Mary Nichols during an interview. “We’ve been running around, turning off ads on you.” Edwin Fancher described the incident at a press awards ceremony, and The Times put it on the front page. The Voice was no longer a little local curiosity; it was now in a public death match with the city’s power elite. In an editorial urging residents to mobilize, Dan Wolf declared “the battle for New York City” and called for “the political demise of Carmine DeSapio.” As in the fight with Moses, The Voice was severely overmatched. If Moses reigned behind closed doors, DeSapio flexed his muscles on the cover of Time magazine. But again, the changing political climate favored the paper. By the middle of the ’60s, after a series of defeats, DeSapio was out of office, and Tammany Hall, which had ruled New York’s Democratic Party for its own enrichment, and that of its mob friends, was dead. The man who replaced DeSapio as district leader was Edward I. Koch, a friend of Mr. Wolf’s and at one time the paper’s lawyer. The paper supported Koch wholeheartedly. Until it didn’t. That, too, was The Voice.","When The Voice folded after more than 60 years, the city lost a contrarian, muckraking spirit that can never be replaced.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"The report revealed that two months after Mr. Cruz was forced to leave Stoneman Douglas, he tried to take the school’s earlier advice and enroll in Cross Creek. His mother said “he had come to realize that the only way he would achieve his goal of graduating from high school” was to do so, the report says. The district was required to respond to Mr. Cruz’s request for special-needs services, known as exceptional student education, within 30 days, the report found. Instead, the district told Mr. Cruz that it would need to evaluate his eligibility for assistance — despite his 15-year record in the school system — and that the process could take six weeks. The process never began: For a new special-needs evaluation to take place, Mr. Cruz first had to re-enroll in Stoneman Douglas. An administrator said it was too late in the school year to take him back. Mr. Cruz had done well at Stoneman Douglas when he began attending the school part-time as a sophomore, after attending Cross Creek as a freshman and for part of eighth grade, according to the report. By the middle of his sophomore year, Mr. Cruz was at Stoneman Douglas full-time. Mr. Cruz joined the Junior R.O.T.C., had a girlfriend and was suspended only once, for making “inappropriate comments,” the report says. The report judged that the decision to move Mr. Cruz to Stoneman Douglas was “appropriate,” even though the school discontinued his behavior intervention plan, intended to inform all of Mr. Cruz’s educators about his problems and how to help him work on them. Mr. Cruz had exhibited aggression starting in prekindergarten, according to the report. A psychological evaluation conducted when he was 5 described the young Mr. Cruz as “impulsive with no sense of boundary; thus, he acts out his fantasies, often explosively, in expressing his feelings of stress and anxiety.” His behavior worsened in middle school. Security or school staff members were required to escort Mr. Cruz around campus, including to the restroom. Outbursts of profanity, disruptive behavior and pulling a false fire alarm resulted in suspensions and his expulsion from the school bus. In eighth grade, he was referred to a disciplinary program for breaking the handle on a bathroom faucet. Mr. Cruz never completed the program. His junior year, Mr. Cruz appeared to have a breakdown. He cut himself, threatened to hurt others and claimed he had ingested gasoline in a possible suicide attempt. Stoneman Douglas officials considered trying to have Mr. Cruz involuntarily committed for a mental-health evaluation, though they ultimately did not. Their assessment of Mr. Cruz concluded with the recommendation that he return to Cross Creek — the offer he rejected.","A report commissioned by the school district in Parkland, Fla., said Nikolas Cruz generally received the help he needed but lost access to it by mistake.",2018-08-04T13:26:52Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Parkland Shooting Suspect Lost Special-Needs Help at School When He Needed It Most,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/04/us/parkland-florida-nikolas-cruz.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/05/us/05parkland/05parkland-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1

VIVIAN WANG,"Also potentially harmful to Mr. Klein was the barrage of negative headlines in recent months, including an accusation of sexual misconduct against him and a state Board of Elections finding of improper campaign financing. The challengers’ victories boosted the emerging progressive narrative that the old political model — buying expensive television ads, cozying up to real estate, corralling union support — had been displaced by vigorous grass-roots organizing. Each challenger outspent his or her opponent on Facebook advertisements, sometimes by a huge margin. Ms. Biaggi and her allies spent between $14,500 and $93,800 on Facebook ads since the website’s online archive launched in May, while Mr. Klein and his supporters spent between $2,400 and $14,796. The challengers also recruited volunteers to fan out across their districts and knock on doors. Ms. Salazar adopted similar tactics against Mr. Dilan, who although he was not a member of the I.D.C. was successfully cast as another out-of-touch corporate Democrat who had not fought sufficiently for tenants’ rights and other working class issues. The Democratic Socialists of America, of which Ms. Salazar is a member, deployed its full organizing power for her in Brooklyn, and she, like some of the I.D.C. challengers, was boosted by the high-profile support of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. A string of negative headlines about her in the final weeks of the campaign — suggesting that she had misled reporters and voters about her immigration status, religious background or socioeconomic status — seemed to have had little impact. Still, there are geographic limitations to the grass-roots organizing model, said Lina Newton, a political-science professor at Hunter College, who observed that Ms. Nixon had deployed similar tactics to no avail on a statewide level. “Personal outreach is much more important on a local level,” Professor Newton said.

"James Crugnale on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","This past spring, Ohio found itself at the epicenter of a fight over a long-lost predator that’s quietly making inroads across the Midwest: the bobcat. A controversial bobcat hunting proposal came to a head in May when sportsmen organizations squared off with conservationists over whether the population had rebounded enough to support a limited trapping season of up to 60 animals, something the Ohio Department of Natural Resources first proposed back in February. At present, 40 states allow the killing of bobcats. “There’s enough there,” Keith Daniels from the Ohio State Trappers Association told the Columbus Dispatch in March. “We don’t want to see a resource go to waste just because someone thinks we shouldn’t.” But the state’s proposal, which came less than four years after Ohio removed bobcats from the endangered list, was met with vocal opposition from conservationists and activists. Some opponents pointed out that Ohio’s bobcats have only recently showed signs of recovery, while their overall numbers throughout the state remain unknown. Others worried that even a limited hunting season could get out of hand quickly. “I have no doubt that the statewide quota would be exceeded on the first or second day,” Suzanne Prange, director of the Appalachian Wildlife Research Institute and opponent of the plan, told Earther, noting that the state was only planning to charge trappers $5 per hunting permit. “My biggest fear was how much it might be exceeded by the time the state could halt the season. They could seriously hurt the population before the season could be stopped.” It’s a microcosm of a fight that’s raging out across the Midwest, where the bobcat has made an extraordinary comeback in recent decades, largely to the credit of state wildlife management agencies and reforestation efforts. But as is the case with other recovering carnivores like Yellowstone’s grizzly bears, there remains vehement disagreement over whether these animals are ready for humans to start hunting them again. An elusive 20 to 30 pound creature known for its distinctive bobbed tail, bobcats historically ranged across a vast swath of North America from northern Mexico to southern Canada. But hunting and trapping, along with the conversion of forests to farmland and the subsequent decline of their prey, took a serious toll on these predators. By the early 1900s, bobcats were virtually extirpated from the Midwest and parts of the eastern United States. “In many states, bobcats were driven to the brink of extinction–or even completely extirpated in some areas–due to loss of habitat, over-hunting, and trapping,” Samantha Hagio, director of wildlife protection at the Humane Society of the United States, told Earther. But around the same time that bobcats were vanishing, policy shifts were setting the stage for their eventual rebound. David McNitt, a grad student at Virginia Tech who focuses his research on bobcats, observed that with the creation of the National Forest System in the early 1900s, the bobcat was provided “large swaths of habitat to act as population refuges.” With the introduction of state agency regulations surrounding hunting and trapping in the decades that followed, the big cat began to re-colonize much of its native distribution. “There’s enough there.” By the late 1990s, bobcats were increasing “throughout the majority of their range,” according to a detailed national survey released in 2010. Even in the Midwest, where, as McNitt observed, public lands are scarce and landscapes are “dominated with monoculture farms” bobcat numbers have appeared to improve just enough to have their conservation status downgraded. Bobcats were removed from Illinois’ list of threatened species in 1999, and they were taken off Indiana’s endangered list in 2005. By 2007, Iowa’s once-endangered bobcats had recovered enough to support limited hunting seasons. In Ohio, bobcats were downgraded from endangered to threatened in 2012 and removed from the endangered species list altogether in 2014. But despite the general upward trend of bobcat numbers (as of 2010, the total US population sat somewhere between 2.3 and 3.6 million ), some experts have cautioned that populations may still remain at risk. “Local threats may decrease population success through time,” Imogene Cancellare, a wildlife biologist at the University of Delaware, told Earther. “Not all populations in the United States are stable, or growing.” During the impassioned debate in Ohio over whether to allow trapping, proponents argued that a 60-bobcat cap wouldn’t put the animal’s numbers at risk. The state Department of Natural Resources agreed. “We’re confident the population is secure. We’re not trying to reduce the number of bobcats,” Mike Reynolds, Wildlife Research Administrator for the ODNR Division of Wildlife told the Dispatch in March. But ultimately, in May, the Ohio Wildlife Council felt that there wasn’t enough information to make a determination either way. By a 6 to 1 vote, the council decided to delay the proposed trapping season until there was more definitive data showing a “thriving population”. One member of the council suggested waiting until after a four-year population study —currently underway by Viorel Popescu and wildlife researchers at Ohio University—was completed. The debate over whether to allow bobcat harvesting is not confined to Ohio. In May, a proposal to open bobcat hunting and trapping in Indiana was shot down by the Indiana Natural Resources Commission after more than 1,300 citizens reportedly spoke out in opposition during the public comment period. Similar debates are playing out with other wild carnivores—albeit significantly more threatened ones—such as the grizzly bear. In May, Wyoming’s Game and Fish Commission voted unanimously to allow the hunting of up to 22 grizzly bears this fall. The decision was met with fierce blowback from conservationists, so much so that a district court could reverse it this week. More and more states are allowing gray wolves to be hunted as populations recover, but those hunts remain equally controversial. For bobcats, recent battles over opening hunting seasons have mostly taken place on the state level. But with the Trump administration weakening wildlife protections for threatened and endangered species and increasing certain privileges for hunters (not to mention Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke proudly tweeting a photo of the stuffed bobcat in his office ), it’s possible that the federal government could soon join the fray. The future for the elusive cats, while brighter than it once was, remains tinged with uncertainty.

The ongoing Kumbh Mela festival in the northern Indian city of Allahabad (recently re-named Prayagraj) is billed as the largest gathering of humanity on earth, with 110 million people expected to attend over 49 days. But for the thousands who get lost among the crowds, help is at hand. The BBC's Geeta Pandey spent a day at the lost and found centres.
""Most people we get are elderly, mostly women above 60 years,"" says Umesh Tiwari who heads the Bhule Bhatke Shivir (lost and found camp), run by local charity Bharat Seva Dal. 
Allahabad's oldest, this camp was set up by his father Raja Ram Tiwari in 1946 and has since helped reunite more than 1.5 million families.
At the entrance, a policeman writes down the details of the new arrivals in a register - their names, addresses, where they came from, any details of who to contact.
Inside, dozens of people who've been separated from friends or family are waiting anxiously. Some are sitting on rope cots inside the compound while others squat on the ground outside in the sun. 
The atmosphere is fraught with tension. Anxious hours have been spent worrying over the fate of a loved one. There are tears and pleading voices: ""Please announce my name [on the public address system] one more time.""
'We got lost on the way to the bathroom'
Among them is a 35-year-old woman (who doesn't want to be named) with her eight-year-old daughter. The child is wrapped in a blanket because when they came in, she had no clothes on. ""My husband and son had bathed and I accompanied my daughter to the bathroom. When we returned, we couldn't find them,"" she tells me. 
Pilgrims at the mela bathe at the Sangam - the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. Hindus believe that doing so will cleanse them of their sins and help them attain ""moksha"", setting them free from the cycle of birth and death.
""We asked around and reached this place at 11am,"" says the woman. ""We've been waiting here for several hours now and don't know what to do.""
Her mobile phone, her handbag, everything is with her husband. The mother and the daughter don't remember any phone numbers and are uncertain how to find their way back home.

 The oldest lost and found camp has been reuniting people since 1946
Some oversized clothes have been found to dress the child and repeated announcements have been made, but so far no one has come for them. 
Mr Tiwari offers to give them money for bus fare, but they're not keen to travel after dark. ""There's no last mile connectivity where I live. How will we reach home safely?"" the woman asks. Mr Tiwari says they can stay the night in the tents at the camp. 
As she sits fretting, weighing her options, one of the staff members comes in to say that her husband has arrived. Looking visibly relieved, the couple leave along with their daughter.
""On some days, the crowds are so thick that people easily get disoriented. We've received 560 people at our centre since the morning and 510 have been reunited with their families,"" Mr Tiwari says. 
As dusk falls, the wait continues for the others. Among them is an elderly man who was separated from his wife in the morning. ""Where is she now? Would she have had something to eat? She has no telephone and no money,"" he says, wiping away a tear.

 The Kumbh Mela is the world's largest gathering of people
""People think what could go wrong? But when adversity strikes, everything does and you can't do anything,"" says Mr Tiwari. 
They have 25 volunteers who fan out across the mela grounds and bring in any one who appears lost. ""It's god's will to separate or reunite people, my calling is to serve them. These people, the lost ones, are my god.""
'No-one knows my real name'
A couple of minutes of walk from the Bhule Bhatke Camp is the brightly-lit Khoya Paya Kendra (Lost and Found Centre), run by the police. When I visit the centre at midday, it's a hive of activity. 
The registration counters are staffed by volunteers - mostly young men and women - who take down the details of the missing in their computers. Some of the volunteers who have come from outside the state are struggling to understand the local dialect and have little understanding of the cultural nuances.
Image copyrightAnkit SrinivasImage caption
 Most of those lost are elderly
At one counter, a volunteer asks a 60-year-old woman, who's been separated from her group, her name so she can fill up a form.
""Ram Bisal ki amma (Ram Bisal's mother),"" she responds. The volunteer is perplexed. ""I don't need to know your son's name, I need your name,"" she repeats. The woman says no-one knows her real name, but when the volunteer insists, she reluctantly says it's Sarsuti Devi Maurya.
Sarsuti Devi says she is visiting the fair with five of her neighbours from her village. She got separated from the group at the Sangam. She landed up at the centre after trying to search for them on her own for an hour. Though she is able to name two of the men in the group, she has no telephone numbers to share.
Many others waiting to be reunited with their friends and families have similar profiles - they are elderly, with little or no education, and remember no telephone numbers. Many are not even sure about details of where they've come from. Most can name their villages but many are unsure about the districts.
Sarsuti Devi is lucky - while her case is being registered, two young men also trying to register a missing person report at another nearby counter spot her. They are, in fact, there to find her.

 Sarsuti Devi Maurya is reunited with her group
Relief is visible on their faces as they all start talking at the same time. ""We were afraid something had happened to her. She's our neighbour in the village. How would we go back and show our faces?"" said Parvesh Yadav. 
Within minutes, Shyamkali, an older woman, joins the group. The two women are relieved to see each other, but they are also upset - Shyamkali thinks Sarsuti Devi was being overconfident and adventurous in going to the river alone, while the latter blames the others for being careless enough to lose her. But soon, they are hugging each other. 
Meanwhile, a constant stream of arrivals is keeping the volunteers busy. Although most people who get separated are reunited, a handful of stories don't have happy endings.

 Announcements are made from the lost and found centres throughout the day
Several hours after Nokha Devi walked into a lost and found centre, the volunteers are still unable to prise any information from her. She looks troubled and is unable to answer questions.
""If no one comes for her in the next 12 hours, we'll hand her over to the police and she will be taken to a shelter for destitute people,"" says one of the volunteers.
'What will we tell her family if we can't find her?'
While I'm hanging around, listening to stories of people, two elderly women come up to me with a small scrap of paper. Two names are scribbled on it with mobile numbers in Hindi.
""Can you please call them to check if my friend is at our camp?"" one of them asks.
Her name, she tells me in Gujarati, is Prabha Ben Patel. She's from the western city of Ahmedabad and she is visiting with two friends. 
""We bathed in the holy waters and went to visit a temple nearby where we lost our friend,"" she says.

 Prabha Ben Patel was worried about her missing friend
It's hard not to get involved. The women are anxious. ""What will we tell her family if we can't find her?"" she asks me.
I call one of the numbers and once it's answered, I hand over the phone to Prabha Ben. She explains the situation and hangs up.
A couple of moments later, my phone rings. At the other end is a woman, speaking excitedly. I hand back the phone to Prabha Ben.
She's finally relaxed. And smiling. Her friend is alright and has turned up at the camp. 
Next door to the Bhule Bhatke Shivir is a camp exclusively for women and children. Also run by a local charity, the Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Smriti Samiti camp has been running since 1956. 
Its manager Sant Prasad Pandey tells me they have reunited 950 people since the morning and that 15 people are still waiting to hear from their families.
""We are providing food, clothes and blankets to those waiting here. And for those who can travel on their own - we are buying them tickets or giving them money to travel home.""
Mr Pandey says they have more than 100 volunteers covering the 32 sq km festival ground and that they have been told to especially keep an ear out for children who are wandering around alone, crying, and bring them in.
'I hope someone finds my five-year-old daughter'
That's the reason why Sandhya Vishvakarma is waiting at this camp - she's looking for Radhika, her five-year-old daughter. 
""It's been more than an hour since we lost her,"" she says, crying. ""We looked for her everywhere and then came here to make announcements about her. I hope someone will find her and bring her here."" Her sister tries to console her.
Mr Pandey tells her that the police at the centre are in touch with the other two centres and that they will let her know as soon as they receive any information about her daughter.
Soon, information arrives that a child matching Radhika's description has been brought to the nearby police-run camp.

 Sandhya is reunited with her five-year-old daughter Radhika
When Sandhya and her sister arrive at the other camp, a policewoman is holding Radhika. The police ask the child if she recognises Sandhya. ""Yes, it's mummy,"" she says.
But first, there are formalities to be completed. The girl is handed over after police are satisfied that Sandhya is who she says she is and not a child trafficker.
""The police told us that an old man found her miles away from here and brought her to them,"" says Sandhya.
Radhika says ""the uncle"" who found her and the ""police uncles"" were nice and that they bought her treats. 
""We were crying our eyes out, she was happy,"" Sandhya says. The tears have been replaced by joyful smiles as they pose for photographs.
It's a story that has ended well.

But she won in their Brooklyn district — which includes Bushwick and Williamsburg — where she is the demographic. Young voters, frustrated by rising rents, didn’t seem to care that she was once a registered Republican, that she said she was born in Colombia when she was born in Florida, that her professed relationship to Judaism was murky, or that her brother said she miscast her family’s financial circumstance. What mattered is that she wasn’t her opponent, who took money from the real-estate industry as the area aggressively gentrified.

GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO,"Impulse! is releasing the album as a single disc, featuring one rendition each of the seven tunes the band cut that day. (Ravi Coltrane and the record executive Ken Druker chose the order.) But for those who buy the deluxe edition, with seven alternate takes from the same session on a separate disc, the biggest score will be the four renditions of “Impressions.” Meditative but headlong, this piece had been the quartet’s concert centerpiece for two years at that point, but Coltrane still hadn’t given it a name. (On the tape box that was found, it was untitled.) An expansive live version would be released later in 1963, on an album called “Impressions,” but this March recording session marked the second and, apparently, final time Coltrane would attempt to wrangle “Impressions” into a studio recording. All the versions hover around the four-minute mark, but each take is different; on two of them, the band rides along at a comfortable, medium tempo with Mr. Tyner adding a chiming, two-chord pattern. On the final two takes, Coltrane ticks the tempo up higher, and slashes boldly without a piano beneath him. The album also includes two original tunes that seem to have been committed to tape here for the first and only time. They’re identified by the numbering system that Thiele used in the studio. The first, “11383,” is a brisk minor blues, with the swirling momentum typical of Coltrane’s live performances and his most affecting records. Then there’s “11386,” a shimmying melody that begins with a wide-flung first section — pulpy chords resounding from Garrison’s bass — then a passage of beaming swing. It bears some structural similarity to Coltrane’s “My Favorite Things” arrangement. But as Mr. Porter pointed out, the tune also sounds a lot like the writing of Mr. Tyner. Indeed, throughout the 1960s, the pianist was writing pieces with this same kind of fast, dancing melody, and a similar balancing act between swing and straight rhythms. “He’s so on top of that piece. It’s just a thought,” Mr. Porter said, referring to Mr. Tyner’s avid playing on all three versions of “11386” featured here. “Where is it written that everything they played had to be by Coltrane?” It’s a tempting, provocative question, and a good one. It’s one of many that this discovery allows us to start asking about the work of an epochal band in its prime.",“Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album” was cut by the saxophonist’s classic quartet two years before “A Love Supreme.” Then it was stashed away.,2018-06-07T17:55:39Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Lost John Coltrane Recording From 1963 Will Be Released at Last,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/arts/music/john-coltrane-lost-album-both-directions-at-once.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/08/arts/08coltrane1/08coltrane1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1
TEJU COLE,"Robert Adamss succinct preface to his 2010 book of photographs What Can We Believe Where? begins with uplift: In common with many photographers, he writes, I began making pictures because I wanted to record what supports hope: the untranslatable mystery and beauty of the world. Adamss aim was true. Look at one of his photographs and youll see a record of mystery and beauty. The photographic elements are simple. Bright sunlight, generally; crisp shadow; the occasional moody nocturne. We feel as if we are being taught to see with a visual primer. Better yet, turn the pages of one of his books (he has made more than 50) or walk around an exhibition of his work, inhabiting the flow of his decisions. You are likely to feel your breath getting calmer and your senses quietened. Adams, who turned 81 this year, has for decades taken the landscape of the American West as his main subject. His photographs depict highways, forests, mountain ranges, streets and homes in black and white; well, not really in black and white but rather in an alluring range of grays, from the brightest to the deepest. His stylistic voice is understated, just above audible. Take one of his most celebrated photographs, used on the cover of What Can We Believe Where? It is a view of a road in Larimer County, Colo., in 1977. The road goes from the bottom left of the picture plane to its right, narrowing to infinity. We see the slate gray surface of the road, its off-white markings, a line of fence posts, a low mountain range in the distance and a charcoal gray shadow, perhaps a trees, falling across the lower third of the picture. The photograph is full of promise: an open road, freedom from obligations, the companionship of a clear sky. Its almost too simple, like a travelers snapshot. But the care with which it has been made the fine grain and subtle printing suggests that something more is there. Possibly this is what Adams means by untranslatable mystery: not merely that the world is mysterious but that a photograph can be, too, not as a translation but as a new statement, faithful to its own form.","For more than four decades, Robert Adams’s landscape photographs have reminded us of what has been lost in America, and what endures.",2018-10-25T09:00:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On Photography: Dispatches From a Ruined Paradise,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/magazine/dispatches-from-a-ruined-paradise.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/28/magazine/28mag-onphoto-slide-X6IZ/28mag-onphoto-slide-X6IZ-facebookJumbo.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1
"JON PARELES, JON CARAMANICA and GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO","Hear releases by Chaka Khan, Mitski, Meek Mill and others. The John Coltrane record “Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album,” which was recorded in 1963 and stashed away, arrives on Friday. Credit Gai Terrell/Redferns, via Getty Images By 1963, when he recorded “Both Directions at Once,” the long-lost album out Friday, John Coltrane was about chant and pulse and scalding pursuit. Yet he continued to write bright, memorable themes; this is still the man who’d penned the tunes on “Blue Train.” The three fresh original compositions on “Both Directions” (those not released on any other official album) charge and tumble, but they also sing. They’re ear-wedges. And then there’s “Slow Blues” — something else entirely — an 11-and-a-half-minute chance to clear out your melody-packed brain and follow Coltrane’s lead more freely. He speaks a thoroughgoing blues language throughout, even as he’s sliding in and out of key, tearing his tones, improvising in cuts against the grain and suggesting alternatives to the harmony and the rhythm. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Meek Mill featuring Miguel, ‘Stay Woke’ This does not need Miguel! Seriously! He’s here to lend some kind of gravity, to cut Meek Mill’s revving engine with a jolt of cut-rate solemnity. But the thing about Meek Mill is that his scream-rapping often just barely conceals a sense of emotional urgency. He is a tense rapper, and this song — his first since being released from prison in late April — has moments that really ache (in spite of the abusive piano-driven production). He’s particularly gutting in the second verse, when he expresses empathy for the wild boys of the SoundCloud-rap generation, spotting their mistakes — and their likely consequences — way before they will, or can. JON CARAMANICA Mitski, ‘Nobody’ Mitski’ s voice is precise yet distraught as she sings about overpowering loneliness in “Nobody.” But the music doesn’t let her wallow; it bounces along on steady piano chords and scrubbing pop-funk rhythm guitar before dropping away at the end, leaving her all alone and repeating the word “nobody” dozens of times. JON PARELES Chaka Khan, ‘Like Sugar’ The tart individuality of Chaka Khan’s voice is barely recognizable in “Like Sugar” because it’s multitracked in unison, canceling out quirks. But the song, produced by Switch, is a keeper that’s bound to be sampled by someone. It’s quantized, minimal cyber-funk with a hopping bass line and one percussion sound highlighted at a time: triangle, bongos, handclaps, cowbell. Still, here’s hoping Ms. Khan’s voice gets more latitude on the rest of her coming album, her first since 2007. J.P. 03 Greedo, ‘Bacc to Jail’ For the past few weeks, 03 Greedo has been recording at a relentless pace in preparation for a difficult road ahead: He was recently sentenced to 20 years in prison for drug and weapon charges. Part of this new haul is a new album, “God Level,” that showcases the weepily melodic approach that made earlier releases like “Purple Summer” and “The Wolf of Grape Street” so enticing. “Bacc to Jail,” from the new album, is a tragic plaint, delivering hard truths with quiet-storm reserve: “Never left when it was ugly, that’s how I know you love me.” 03 Greedo’s story now moves to its next chapter. J.C. Paramore, ‘Caught in the Middle’ Paramore, which usually plays pop-punk, glances toward the Jamaican influences of No Doubt — another band led by a woman grappling with power and desire — with the reggae backbeat of “Caught in the Middle,” a reflection on growing up, self-questioning and perseverance. “I don’t need no help/I can sabotage me by myself,” sings Hayley Williams, 29, but she continues, “I gotta keep going or they’ll call me a quitter.” The song dovetails vulnerability into persistence. J.P. Black Grapefruit, ‘Omygod’ Everything gets chopped up and turned around in “Omygod” by Black Grapefruit, the electronic-pop duo of Randa Smith and Brian Dekker; it’s from an album due August 10. Vocal syllables and percussion that appears and disappears create a Caribbean-tinged beat; synthesizer tones waft in and fade out; barking dogs and screams of “Omygod!” disrupt a melody that holds a fractured apology: “You told me what you held in/And I held back what you needed.” After an eventful three minutes, the songs finds a surprise resolution in something like gospel. J.P. Bad Bunny, ‘Estamos Bien’ “Estamos Bien” is an ethereal take on the Bad Bunny sound. There’s a natural mournfulness about his singing, but when it’s stretched out taffy-like, as it is here, it begins to take on a wistful quality, a good match for this song about living well. And the charming video is a soft-focus pastel fantasy, a celebration of friends who let you act your goofiest and summers where you get to live free. J.C. Liz Cooper &amp; the Stampede, ‘Hey Man’ A nugget of 50-years-late-breaking psychedelia out of Nashville, “Hey Man” circles through four chords and flaunts a distorted guitar hook, jazzy drumming and an elaborate but transparent throng of voices and guitars behind Liz Cooper’s straightforward come-on. The 11-year-old dancer Madysen Reilly gleefully commandeers the video clip. J.P. Let’s Eat Grandma, ‘I Will Be Waiting' Let’s Eat Grandma — the eccentric, teenage English songwriting duo of Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth — test the limits of pop in “I Will Be Waiting,” from its new album, “I’m All Ears,” which negotiates between pop formulas and wayward impulses. The song uses Minimalistic keyboards to capture the vertigo of infatuation, until drums kick in and insist on a direction. “It’s late but I will be waiting for you,” the chorus proclaims, tentatively and then proudly. J.P. Pan Amsterdam, ‘Landlord Elijah’ A trumpeter by trade, Leron Thomas has hacked his path as a lonely provocateur for more than a decade. On his solo records, he sings, produces, plays all kinds of instruments, earnestly ironizes, makes slyly brilliant videos to accompany the music. In April, under the alias Pan Amsterdam, he put out “The Pocket Watch,” a short album of lazing underground hip-hop (plus trumpet solos). Last week Mr. Thomas released an update to one of the record’s quiet winners, “Landlord Elijah.” The more drolly syncopated original version is an easy one to prefer, with an adorned Pete Rock sample that kicks, and a gleefully corny declaration over the break: “If it was already written, well then shall I not have scorn/A jazz musician died, Pan Am was born.” But as he touches up the polish on “Re-Do,” he never loses the sense of preposterous honesty.

JULIE CRESWELL and MICHAEL CORKERY,"The hedge fund manager Edward S. Lampert has spent the last 14 years steering Sears as it spun off businesses, took on debt and, this week, filed for bankruptcy protection. It has been a long, and often painful, trip, but how has Mr. Lampert fared? His hedge fund, ESL Investments, appears to have racked up a much more modest loss than the companys Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing would suggest, according to corporate filings and interviews with analysts and investors. ESLs nearly 50 percent stake in Sears will probably be wiped out in bankruptcy. But that loss is offset by gains elsewhere. For example, Mr. Lampert has collected hundreds of millions of dollars in interest and fees from Sears. He also took stakes in businesses that were spun off from the company, and some of those investments are doing well. He and his hedge fund played an unusual role at Sears. In addition to being the companys controlling shareholder, ESL was one of its biggest lenders.

AMY HARMON,"Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees refugee resettlement, began making calls last year to determine what had happened to 7,635 children the government had helped place between last October and the end of the year. From these calls, officials learned that 6,075 children remained with their sponsors. Twenty-eight had run away, five had been removed from the United States and 52 had relocated to live with a nonsponsor. The rest were unaccounted for, giving rise to the 1,475 number. It is possible that some of the adult sponsors simply chose not to respond to the agency. Losing track of children who arrive at the border alone is not a new phenomenon. A 2016 inspector general report showed that the federal government was able to reach only 84 percent of children it had placed, leaving 4,159 unaccounted for. This is where people are likely getting the idea that the Trump administration has separated children from their parents and then lost them. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new “zero tolerance” policy earlier this month that included imposing criminal penalties meant to deter Central American families from trying to cross the border illegally. If a mother or father is with a child when apprehended for the crime of illegal entry, the minor must be taken from the parent. Hundreds of immigrant children have already been separated from their parents at the border since October, and the new policy will result in a steep increase. “If you don’t want your child separated, then don’t bring them across the border illegally,” Mr. Sessions said.","Federal officials have lost track of nearly 1,500 children, but those children arrived at the border alone.",2018-05-28T20:27:21Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Did the Trump Administration Separate Immigrant Children From Parents and Lose Them?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/us/trump-immigrant-children-lost.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/29/us/29children/29children-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1
Victoria Song,"Last year, a borked server migration resulted in MySpace losing all of the music uploaded to the website between 2003 and 2015a loss estimated at more than 50 million tracks from 14 million artists. But now a small fraction has been recovered thanks to an anonymous group of academics and uploaded to the Internet Archive.
The Internet Archive says it received 490,000 mp3 files originally hosted on MySpace from an anonymous academic study conducted between 2008 and 2010. The group was purportedly studying music networks at the time and grabbed 1.3 terabytes of music from MySpace, then contacted the Internet Archive once it heard about the loss. The collection has since been dubbed The MySpace Dragon Hoard (2008-2010).
You can search through collection through the archives Hobbit interface, which has been designed to look like the old MySpace player. Its not a perfect search enginethe sheer size of the collection means it takes a while to load up at first. Still, the hefty hoard has already brought some solace to creators affected by the loss.
Of course, this impressive collection is only a mere fraction of the total number of songs lost. If were being totally honest, their recovery is also apparently the result of dumb luck. MySpace had nothing to do with it, and if not for the kindness of some anonymous academics and a non-profit group dedicated to preserving internet history, these tracks would still be lost. While its possible there are more lost songs lurking somewhere on a forgotten hard drive, its unlikely that the majority of the songs lost will ever resurface.

LIAM STACK,"“I think values and principles that people hold don’t change,” Mr. Harris said. “A lot of these things comeback to states’ rights and you’re going to see that with Roe v. Wade.” Mr. Harris pointed to state-level initiatives to regulate abortion, like one that recently advanced in Iowa, as an example of how opponents of same-sex marriage could confront the issue. “You’re already seeing abortion laws passed in some states that will be challenged in court and you’ll see the same things with that issue,” he said. “These are states’ rights issues and we’ll have to wait and see how the various states deal with them.” North Carolina’s 9th District, which stretches from Charlotte to Fayetteville, has traditionally been friendly ground for Republicans, but observers said the financial mismatch between the two opponents, coupled with anti-establishment political headwinds nationwide, could make it a tossup in November. “This is great news for Dan McCready,” said Morgan Jackson, a Democratic strategist in North Carolina. He also predicted that Mr. Harris’s history of conservative social activism would hurt him in the general election. “He is a guy who is very far to the right, farther to the right than this district is, but in order to motivate his base to turn out he has to tack to the right,” Mr. Jackson said. “If he tacks to the middle, he alienates his base.

CHRISTINE HAUSER,"Sergeant Rogers writes of the hot Texas weather during training, of missing the family dog, of snow and hockey, of slow mail service and an aching wisdom tooth. In later letters, he suggests a disdain for and willingness to fight the Japanese and Germans.
Dear folks, he wrote on Oct. 22, 1942, shortly after his induction. Everything is hunky dorey. Boy, they really keep you hoppin.
Dont know when I will be shipped out, he continued. Soon, I hope.
With earnest good nature, Sergeant Rogers tells his parents of being given a choice to be trained as a radio operator, a parachute rigger or a welder all trades that he jokes he knows nothing about.
On April 27, 1943, from Harlingen Army Gunnery School in Texas, he was joyful about the air-conditioned barracks and relieved he had passed his physical.
Three months later, in July 1943, he referred to himself as a slap-happy soldier with some bad news. Writing from the latrine, the only place where lights were still on in the barracks, he said a few of his comrades had been killed in crashes. They didnt have a chance, he wrote. They were expecting the dubious honor of a visiting general, he wrote.
On Nov. 8, 1943, by then doing bombing runs over Tarawa, Sergeant Rogers asks about his parents new house, and said he was bitten up by mosquitoes during nighttime guard duty. He said he had been put in a gunner post, and observed that the Japanese were not as suicidal as theyd like you to believe.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright World Vision Australia Image caption Two-year-old George is one of hundreds of asylum seekers living on Nauru Suicide attempts and horrifying acts of self-harm are drawing fresh attention to the suffering of refugee children on Nauru, in what is being described as a ""mental health crisis"". The tiny island nation, site of Australia's controversial offshore processing centre, has long been plagued with allegations of human rights abuses. But a series of damning media reports recently has also highlighted a rapidly deteriorating situation for young people. ""We are starting to see suicidal behaviour in children as young as eight and 10 years old,"" says Louise Newman, professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne who works with families and children on the island. ""It's absolutely a crisis."" A loss of hope Australia intercepts all asylum seekers and refugees who try to reach its shores by boat. It insists they will never be able to resettle in Australia, so over the years has sent many to privately run ""processing centres"" it funds on Nauru and in Papua New Guinea. Groups working with families on Nauru paint a brutal picture of life for children on the island. Many have lived most of their life in detention, with no idea of what their future will be. The trauma they have endured, coupled with poor - and often dangerous conditions - contribute to a sense of hopelessness. Natasha Blucher, detention advocacy manager at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), was unable to share details of specific cases with the BBC due to privacy and safety concerns. But she said ASRC works with about 15 children who have either made repeated suicide attempts or are regularly self-harming. She also believes the problem has reached crisis point. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Australia has been repeatedly criticised for its tough policy on refugees and asylum seekers ASRC, like most advocates and medical professionals, assist families on Nauru remotely as access to the island is heavily restricted. It estimates at least 30 children are suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome - also known as resignation syndrome. It's a rare psychiatric condition where sufferers, as a response to severe trauma, effectively withdraw from life. The condition can be life-threatening as victims become unable to eat and drink. ""Around three months ago we were seeing a smattering of this... then over that period it seems to have proliferated,"" Ms Blucher told the BBC. What is traumatic withdrawal syndrome? It is a progressive, deteriorating condition most commonly seen in children and that can be life threatening. Begins with disengagement from enjoyable activities such as playing or drawing and progressively worsens. Sufferers may begin to refuse food and drink. In the worst cases a sufferer will become unresponsive, unable to speak and their body will begin to shut down. Treatment, which can take months, requires access to paediatric intensive care. A large outbreak was observed in group of asylum seekers in Sweden. Children ‘attempting suicide’ at Greek refugee camp Children feel 'unsafe' Prof Newman, a former advisor to the Australian government on the mental health of asylum seekers, says the outbreak of this very serious condition is particularly concerning. ""In many ways it's not surprising… they are exposed to a lot of trauma there [and] a sense of hopelessness and abandonment. They feel very unsafe"". Another physician assisting with children's cases is GP Barri Phatarfod. Her organisation Doctors 4 Refugees has not been allowed to visit Nauru but receives referrals from advocates for assessment and advice. She says of the 60 cases referred to her organisation, every child has some mental health impairment. ""It's impossible not to,"" she says. ""They witness suicide attempts almost daily as well as sexual harassment and physical and sexual abuse and there is no prospect of release."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Nauru is roughly about 3,000 km (1,800 miles) north-east of Australia At present most cases involve children from Iran, as well as kids from Iraq, Lebanon and Rohinyga. Dr Phatarfod adds that children as young as three are ""displaying inappropriately sexualised behaviour - behaviour that typically only comes from having this acted upon themselves"". A divisive policy One key proponent of the policy was the country's new prime minister, Scott Morrison, who rose to national prominence as a hardline immigration minister. Mr Morrison was one of the toughest enforcers of the divisive ""Stop the Boats"" policy and years later, becomes leader as unease over the treatment of asylum seekers hasn't abated. Supporters argue the policy has been highly effective, resulting in a dramatic drop in illegal boat arrivals. The government said a vessel that made land this week was the first boat carrying illegal asylum seekers to reach Australia since 2014. But critics point to the huge physical and mental toll exacted on the people placed in offshore detention facilities. Image copyright World Vision Australia Image caption A World Vision image shows two-year-old Roze, who lives on Nauru. In 2015, the site on Nauru became an ""open centre,"" meaning residents can come and go as they please. But this has done little to improve life for children on the island. The tiny Pacific island is just 21 sq km (8 sq miles) and covered with phosphate rocks. It was mined heavily and has few trees or animals. Advocates say even though the camp is technically open, there are few places for people to go. Access to care As the children's health crisis worsens, a coalition of human rights groups has demanded the Australian government remove the 119 asylum seeker children off Nauru and resettled them elsewhere. In a statement, the Australian government said it ""takes seriously its role in supporting the Government of Nauru to ensure that children are protected from abuse, neglect or exploitation"". ""A range of care, welfare and support arrangements are in place to provide for the needs of children and young people,"" it said. Medical services including a hospital are available on Nauru but experts say they are inadequate. If a person needs more complex treatment, a referral must be made to the Nauruan government to have them transferred overseas for care. ""When a person cannot receive appropriate treatment for a significant health condition in Nauru, the person is offered treatment in Taiwan, Papua New Guinea or Australia. Those cases are referred to the Department by the person's treating clinician,"" the Australian government said. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The latest figures from the Refugee Council of Australia estimate around 1,500 asylum seekers are living on Nauru and Manus Island Still, many argue the system of referrals is failing children on Nauru. Advocates say the process is too slow, and they are overwhelmed by the volume of children experiencing mental health problems. Jennifer Kanis, head of the social justice practice at law firm Maurice Blackburn, is leading several cases to bring urgent medical care to young people on the island. She believes that even though these children have never entered Australian territory, the Australian government has a duty of care. ""It devastating… that we have to take legal action to get proper medical care for these kids,"" Ms Kanis says. ""The government is more concerned with their policy of keeping this cohort of people seeking asylum off Australia than they are with their health.""","A rare condition is threatening lives of refugee children on Nauru who have ""lost hope"", advocates say.",2018-08-31T23:55:18Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",The children stuck in Australia's island camp,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45327058,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/127E5/production/_103194757_4ce84730-525b-453f-bf41-eea06b492844.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,lost,1

JOHN OTIS,"Ms. Brunn says she is grateful that she is otherwise healthy. And she takes great joy in spending time with her family, including 10 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. But she is no stranger to heartache. In 1982, Ms. Brunn’s partner, the father of her five children, died after having a stroke. She lost two sisters to cancer in the past 10 years. And the most shattering blow came in 2010, she said, when her youngest son, Maurice Davis, died of colon cancer.

Her greatest disappointment, she said, is that she can no longer venture outside alone. “I used to love going out for walks,” Ms. Brunn said. “I probably used to go to the store around three or four times a day. I love to get out. I miss that.” Now she can leave home only if she has a chaperone, a role most often filled by her son Edward Davis, 50, who drops by regularly. He guides her throughout the neighborhood as she instructs him to go to various stores. They are so well-known that Mr. Davis says he cannot wander into shops alone without raising eyebrows “There’ll be times when I’m outside going to the store and all I can hear is, ‘Where’s Mommy?’” he said. Photo Ms. Brunn waiting for her son to take her to the supermarket. She can leave home only if she has a chaperone. Credit David Dee Delgado for The New York Times Ms. Brunn is particular about her shopping, especially when it comes to food, and she prefers to buy certain items at certain stores. Mr. Davis joked that it was just a ruse to extend their excursions. Ms. Brunn says she cooks often, a habit she formed during years of keeping five mouths fed. “I don’t really like it too much,” she admitted, adding that chicken dishes were her specialty. “I do it because I have to.” Ms. Brunn also has food delivered by Meals on Wheels, which brings one hot meal to her home every day at lunchtime. It is one of the services offered by Heights and Hills, which offers support to older adults in Brooklyn. Heights and Hills is a member agency of FPWA, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The agency also provided Ms. Brunn with a caseworker.

On her monthly income of $1257, a combination of Social Security and a pension, she could not afford an air-conditioner. FPWA used $639 from the fund to buy one for her. Once an avid reader, Ms. Brunn now listens to audiobooks. Mystery is her genre of choice. She has no desire to learn Braille; it would be too difficult, she said. Listening to television has becoming her go-to entertainment, particularly daytime courtroom shows. Constantly having to listen appears to have made Ms. Brunn a woman of few words, saying just enough to express what is necessary. She says she also has few worries. “I don’t let nothing bother me,” Ms. Brunn said. Then she fell silent.

 Protesters celebrate amid rumours over President Omar al-Bashir's fate
Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has been ousted and arrested following months of protests, the army has announced.
It is a momentous move - Mr Bashir had been in power, and ruled the country with an iron fist, for nearly 30 years.
The BBC looks at five significant moments that explain how we got here.
30 June 1989: General Bashir comes to power
Image copyrightAFP
Mr Bashir seized power in a military coup in 1989, amid a long civil war between Sudan's north and south.
During his time in power, he was accused of war crimes during the Darfur conflict, which began in 2003 when rebels took up arms at alleged government discrimination. Hundreds of thousands were killed in the crisis. 
The International Criminal Court (ICC) indicted Mr Bashir on charges of crimes against humanity and genocide - although the investigation was eventually suspended due to a lack of UN support. 
However, Mr Bashir went on to win his first term as an elected president in polls in 2010.
9 July 2011: South Sudan becomes independent
Image copyrightAFPImage caption
 99% of South Sudan voted for independence
In 2011, following a referendum, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan. The referendum had been part of a peace deal agreed between Mr Bashir and rebels from the south.
However, the split had significant financial repercussions, because South Sudan gained 75% of the territory's oil.
Sudan's economy - which had already been strained by more than a decade of US sanctions - was hit hard.
The government imposed austerity measures and cut subsidies in response to the drop in oil revenue - but this lead to waves of protests as prices for basic goods shot up. 
The government responded by dispersing protesters, arresting opposition politicians, and censoring the media.
Meanwhile, Mr Bashir was re-elected in 2015 in a vote boycotted by the opposition.
19 December 2018: Anti-austerity protests 
In late 2017, the US lifted some sanctions on Sudan. However, the economy continued to deteriorate - by November 2018, inflation was at almost 70%.
As the Sudanese pound plummeted in value, the government imposed emergency austerity measures and cut fuel and bread subsidies.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Many had to wait more than an hour to buy bread
This triggered waves of mass protests across the country in December. The protests were initially focused on living costs - but soon demonstrators also started demanding that Mr Bashir step down.
More than 1,000 protesters were reportedly detained by government forces. 
22 February 2019: State of emergency
In February, Sudan's National Security and Intelligence Services said that Mr Bashir would step down.
However, Mr Bashir was defiant, declaring a national state of emergency, dismissing the federal government and replacing all state governors with members of the security forces instead. 
He also tried to placate protesters, saying he would stand down at the end of his term in April 2020 and not seek re-election. However, this was not enough for demonstrators - and critics argued he had previously pledged to step down and then gone back on his word. 
6 April 2019: Protesters close in on the army headquarters 
Thousands of demonstrators reached the military headquarters - which is near the presidential compound - for the first time.
Media captionA woman dubbed 'Kandaka', which means Nubian queen, has become a symbol for protesters
Thousands camped outside throughout the week - and while security forces used tear gas and made arrests, the police ordered officers not to ""intervene against the citizens or peaceful rallies"".
The police said they supported the ""peaceful transition of power"". 
According to analysts, the military and security forces were also divided on how to respond, with reports that army officers wanted to avoid violence, while security chiefs and some paramilitary groups were ready to use lethal force.

KATIE BENNER,"Mr. Sessions saw in Mr. Trump a candidate who was interested in the socially conservative and protectionist agenda that he favored and that slotted him as one of the most conservative members of the Senate. He became the first senator to back Mr. Trump, lending credibility to his 2016 campaign amid a heated Republican primary contest. In return for his loyalty, Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Sessions as attorney general only to quickly come to regret the decision. Mr. Sessionss recusal from the Russia investigation prompted more than a year of public complaints and private humiliations by Mr. Trump. He took the job and then he said, Im going to recuse myself, the president said this year in a Fox News interview. I said, What kind of a man is this? An even-tempered former Eagle Scout and a Methodist, Mr. Sessions is unlikely to ever publicly attack the president in return. Even in private conversations, Mr. Sessions never criticized Mr. Trump, no matter how low their relationship had sunk, said Richard W. Moore, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Alabama in Mobile and a longtime friend of Mr. Sessionss. I dont think he will say anything bad about him in the future, ever, Mr. Moore predicted. Its not who he is. Mr. Sessions tried at least twice to resign last year, though presidential aides stopped him. On the outs with the president, Mr. Sessions focused on reorienting the department toward the Trump agenda. He redefined civil rights, pulled back on oversight of the police and sided with restrictions on voting rights. Perhaps most prominently, his zero-tolerance approach on illegal immigration led to separations of families that set off a broad outcry and forced Mr. Trump to retreat.","In pushing out Attorney General Jeff Sessions, President Trump lost a cabinet official who carried out his agenda more effectively than perhaps anyone else in the administration.",2018-11-08T10:00:11Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Sessions Executed the Agenda of a President Who Could Not Look Past a Betrayal,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/politics/sessions-trump-justice-department-legacy.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/09/us/politics/09dc-sessions-1/09dc-sessions-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1

But the meeting also exposed a dilemma that Mr. Cuomo and Democrats nationally face: They must oppose Mr. Trump at all costs, but they also cant stand in the way of progress on key projects. Mr. Cuomo desperately needs to improve mass transit in New York. To do so, he needs federal money, which means he needs Mr. Trumps support. Its a tricky balance.

Lily is a seven-year-old girl whose family comes to stay with friends when they lose their apartment. She tells fellow muppet Elmo about her situation while the pair paint a rainbow mural, saying sadly: ""I'm not sure I want to paint anymore."" The are using the colour purple, the same shade that was in her old bedroom. Lily explains that she had to leave the room behind, as ""we don't have our own apartment anymore. And we've been staying in all different kinds of places"". On social media, some fans joked that the lovably grumpy bin-dwelling character Oscar the Grouch, who debuted in 1969, has ""been homeless since the Vietnam War"". However, since he chooses to live in a dustbin and sings a song called ""I Love Trash"", this is likely to be his own choice. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Oscar the Grouch (left) receives visitors from his bin, and appears to live there happily Sesame Workshop, the non-profit group behind Sesame Street, said there are more than 2.5 million homeless children across the US, nearly half of whom are under six. ""We know children experiencing homelessness are often caught up in a devastating cycle of trauma,"" the group said. As well as the daily hardship of being homeless, those children may suffer due to ""poverty, domestic violence, or other trauma that caused them to lose their home"", said Sherrie Westin of Sesame Workshop. ""We want [homeless children] to know that they are not alone."" This is not Lily's first appearance on the famous street. In her 2011 debut, she was shown feeling hungry because her family didn't always have food available.

TYLER KEPNER,"The sports are fundamentally different in their development processes, of course. Almost every baseball player logs years in the minors, riding buses to remote outposts for a punishing daily test that is at least as much mental as physical. A first-round N.F.L. quarterback is typically hailed as the instant savior of his franchise.
Murrays predecessor as Heisman Trophy winner and Oklahoma quarterback, Baker Mayfield, needed one month to establish himself as the starter for the Cleveland Browns. He sat the first two weeks, came off the bench in Week 3 and was starting for good by Sept. 30. Whats more appealing to a 21-year-old athlete: the Mayfield plan, or a summer trying to hit sliders for an As affiliate in Beloit, Wis., or Stockton, Calif.?
Murrays uncle, Calvin Murray, offers an example of the uncertainties of life as a baseball prospect. The San Francisco Giants chose Calvin Murray with the seventh overall pick in the 1992 draft. He played more than 1,600 professional games, but fewer than 300 in the majors. The player taken one pick before Murray did just a bit better. His name was Derek Jeter.
Well probably never know what Kyler Murray could have been as a baseball player. He could always try the sport again if football fizzles, as Tim Tebow is doing with the Mets. But baseball, as an institution, does not give itself the best chance to attract an athlete like Murray, whose bonus potential was limited by the strict draft-slotting system instituted in 2012.
The draft system has always incentivized losing, to some extent in 2009 and 2010, the Washington Nationals plotted a new course by taking Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper first over all in consecutive drafts. But by awarding a fixed amount of bonus money to teams with the worst team getting by far the largest allowance the new rules have greatly encouraged protracted rebuilding.
The Houston Astros understood this better than most, and became a perennial power by using the system to their advantage. They have spawned so many imitators that a record eight teams tallied 95 losses last season.","Kyler Murray will return most of the money paid to him by the Oakland Athletics, but the team will retain his rights should he come back to baseball later.",2019-02-12T02:33:31Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","On Baseball: In the Case of Kyler Murray, the A’s Bet Big and Lost",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/sports/kyle-murray-oakland-athletics-football.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/12/sports/12kepner1/12kepner1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,lost,1
Rhett Jones,"The case of the RMS Titanic sinking in 1912 has generated numerous absurd conspiracy theories over the years, but it turns out the discovery of its wreckage was indeed part of a real-life military cover-up. According to a new report, the team that found the unsinkable ship at the bottom of the ocean was actually charged with locating two missing nuclear submarines. Robert Ballard, the oceanographer who led the American team that found the Titanic, is finally allowed to tell the newly-declassified story of what really happened in 1985. Speaking with CBS News, he explained that he had already executed several top secret missions for the Navy when he found himself building an underwater vehicle in 1982. Unable to secure a science grant for the Titanic exhibition, Ballard got the idea of asking the Navy to pay for it. He approached Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Ronald Thunman and explained that it was his lifelong dream to find the Titanic and was curious if the military department could find a way to make that happen. Thunman apparently thought Ballard was crazy but agreed to the plan as long as Ballard did something for the Navy first. The military wanted to explore two nuclear submarines that had gone missing in the 1960s. It was the height of the Cold War and the military did not want the Russians or other adversaries stumbling upon the USS Thresher and the USS Scorpion. We knew where the subs were, Ballard told CNN. What they wanted me to do was go back and not have the Russians follow me, because we were interested in the nuclear weapons that were on the Scorpion and also what the nuclear reactors (were) doing to the environment. The plan was to hide the mission in plain sight. The press would only be told about the hunt for the Titanic and no adversaries would be suspicious of the teams activities. Ballard was primarily tasked with exploring the USS Scorpion and when that mission was accomplished he moved on to his own personal goal with 12 days left on the clock. I learned something from mapping the Scorpion that taught me how to find the Titanic: look for its trail of debris, he told CBS. The team found the wreckage eight days later and its initial celebrations quickly turned sober as the understanding set in that they were looking at the grave site for 1,500 people. They returned home as heroes and had to maintain their cover story. After the discovery was announced, a Navy spokesperson told the New York Times that the military only funded the project because it was interested in the testing of new underwater equipment. It doesnt feel so much like the public was lied to as it does that there was whole other shadowy side to the project we never knew about. Everyone got what they wanted and its a pretty innocuous cover-up. At least, thats what they want us to believe.

Catie Keck,"Following a catastrophic fire in September that destroyed millions of priceless items at the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, Google has unveiled a project that preserved some of those precious artifacts and can now be explored through Google Street View. Googles Arts &amp; Culture team began collaborating with the museum on taking its collection digital back in 2016, Program Manager Chance Coughenour wrote in a Google blog on Thursday. That catalog is now available online for users globally to revisit some of the rich cultural heritage that was housed in the museums massive collection. The fire that tore through the museum earlier this year devastated 200 years of precious items. Among the those lost in the fire were dinosaur bones, remains of the oldest human found in the Americas known as Luzia (some of which were able to be recovered ), Egyptian artifacts, and numerous other scientifically and culturally significant items. Luiz Duarte, a vice director at the museum, described the incident at the time as an unbearable catastrophe. President Michel Temer of Brazil tweeted that the loss of the museums collection was incalculable for Brazil. Since the fire in September, more than 1,500 items have been recovered from the debris, and plans for beginning the slow process of restoring the museum are reportedly already underway. The museums director Alexander Kellner said its important to stress that the National Museum, despite having lost a significant part of its collection, has not lost its ability to generate knowledge. Pop into the museum for a tour of its collection right here.

Adam Clark Estes,"Just when you thought all data breaches amounted to hacker shenanigans, the largest bank in Australia has belatedly confirmed a different sort of breach story. BuzzFeed reports that the Commonwealth Bank lost 12 million customers’ data after magnetic tape backups containing their personal financial history from 2004 to 2014 went missing. It just lost them. They may have literally fallen off a truck. And the bank didn’t even bother telling its customers about the incident. While said losing-of-data was only publicly revealed this week, it took place back in 2016, when the Commonwealth Bank hired a subcontractor to destroy the backup tapes while decommissioning a data center. After it didn’t get a receipt of the tapes’ destruction, the bank investigated and discovered that the tapes were nowhere to be found. Had they been destroyed? Nobody knew for sure. In response, the Commonwealth Bank formed a task force (codename “Project Chesapeake”) and hired accounting firm KPMG, which was also unable to locate the missing tapes. According to BuzzFeed, KPMG even explored the possibility that “the drives weren’t secured properly and fell from a truck in transit that was carrying the data for destruction.” The bank told Buzzfeed that the accounting firm ultimately concluded the tapes were “most likely” destroyed. The news arrives at a real bummer of a time for privacy. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, nobody feels very secure about their data. But surely, people might think, our financial institutions can be trusted with our information. This is not true. Just last month, SunTrust Bank admitted that an employee may have stolen the personal data of 1.5 million customers and possibly sold it to criminals. And who could forget how credit reporting agency Equifax fell victim to cybercriminals, potentially exposing the data of over 145 million Americans —just one of many data breaches last year. The detail about magnetic tapes falling off the back of a truck is funny, but the use of the technology in data storage is actually not uncommon. As recently as just few years ago, many large banks, the IRS, and even Google and Amazon were still using magnetic tapes to back up large amounts of data. Increasingly, businesses are turning to cloud storage for their backup needs, though some security hawks might point out that in-house magnetic tapes are still uniquely secure since they’re not connected to the internet. Of course, they are not so secure if you put them in the back of a subcontractor’s truck. The good news for Commonwealth Bank customers is that KPMG, the accounting firm, does not believe that sensitive data ever got into the hands of criminals after the loss of the tapes. The bad news is that human society is a never-ending comedy of errors in which our hopes and dreams play out as farce. At least the weather is nice, sometimes.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption In 1975, Xia Boyu handed his sleeping bag to a suffering teammate - and lost both feet to frostbite A Chinese climber who was crippled by frostbite on Everest more than 40 years ago has scaled the summit at the start of this year's climbing season. In 1975, Xia Boyu lost his feet after giving his sleeping bag to a sick teammate during a high-altitude storm. Now aged 69, he became the second double amputee to scale Everest - and the first ever from the Nepalese side. Australian Steve Plain, meanwhile, set the record for the fastest climb of the highest mountains on seven continents. Plain's achievement also features a story of overcoming physical challenge, coming four years after he broke his neck in a surfing accident. 'A challenge of fate' The storm that caused Xia's frostbite struck in the ""death zone"" above 8,000m (26,200ft) and stranded his team for three nights, not far from the summit. As a result, he needed to have his feet amputated. Then, in 1996, his legs were amputated above the knee as he battled lymphoma. Despite his injuries, he never abandoned the notion of reaching the summit. ""Climbing Mount Everest is my dream,"" he told AFP news agency in April. ""I have to realise it. It also represents a personal challenge, a challenge of fate."" After the disastrous 1975 climb, he made three more attempts, in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The 2016 attempt brought him close to the summit before a blizzard set in. However, a ban on climbers like Xia almost ended his attempts. Nepalese authorities moved last year to ban double amputees - along with blind and solo climbers - from attempting to reach the summit. The authorities said the new rules were a safety measure but they were struck down by the courts earlier this year as discriminatory. On Monday, supported by a team of Sherpa guides, Xia reached the summit in what the Himalayan Times says is the first successful double amputee climb from the Nepal side. It also makes him only the second double-amputee to ever reach the summit of the world's highest mountain. Mark Inglis, of New Zealand, became the first when he reached the summit in 2006. Inglis also lost his limbs to frostbite in a climbing accident, after spending two weeks in an ice cave sheltering from a mountain storm. 'Hangman's fracture' Steve Plain also took advantage of the first day possible to reach the summit, setting his four-month speed record for the seven continents. Both Plain and Xia's teams had already begun their climb when Sherpa guides affixed ropes to the summit, opening the final leg of the route for the climbing season. That meant that Plain could reach his seventh mountain peak on his seventh continent in just 117 days - shaving nine days off the previous record. The seven summits Mr Plain scaled are, in order of completion: Vinson, Antarctica (4,892m/16,066ft) Aconcagua, South America, (6,962m/22,840ft) Kilimanjaro, Africa (5895m/19,340ft) Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4884m/16,020ft) Elbrus, Europe (5642m/18,510 ft) Denali, North America (6,190m/20,310ft) Everest, Asia (8,848m/29,030ft) Plain was surfing in Western Australia in the summer of 2014 when a wave dumped him, head first, into the sand. He suffered a broken neck or ""hangman's fracture"" and said doctors had told him they were not sure if he would ever walk again. ""Three and a half years ago I was lying in hospital with a broken neck and at that time set myself the goal,"" he wrote on Facebook after reaching the summit. Plain has also been using his record attempt to raise money for charities the Surf Life Saving Association and SpinalCure Australia - two groups he has close associations with after his own injuries.",Xia Boyu lost his feet to frostbite after giving his sleeping bag to a sick teammate in 1975.,2018-05-14T15:26:16Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Double amputee Xia Boyu makes history on Everest summit,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44112710,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17510/production/_101540559_gettyimages-942465392.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,lost,1
