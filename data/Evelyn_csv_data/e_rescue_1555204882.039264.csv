https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Ericsson Image caption Mobile operators say drones working with mobile networks will speed up emergency response Drones may be best known for taking impressive aerial videos and inspecting buildings, infrastructure and crops, but they also promise to improve mobile and internet connectivity for emergency services and consumers. Poor mobile signal in rural areas is frustrating, but it can also be life-threatening in emergency situations. Slow emergency response times mean higher mortality rates. Mobile signals are usually sent via base stations, attached to buildings or special masts. These are tough to put up in a hurry - so why not attach a base station to a drone? For the last two years, the Finnish tech firm Nokia and British mobile operator EE have been flying small quadcopter drones mounted with portable mobile base stations in Scotland. The idea is that in an emergency, a drone could hover over a disaster area to provide instant 4G mobile network coverage with a 50km (31 mile) radius. But drones can't fly for very long before the battery runs out - 30 minutes is a typical maximum. So US telecoms giant AT&amp;T is developing a large, helicopter-like drone known as the ""Flying COW"", short for ""Cell on Wings"". It is tethered to the ground by a cable that gives it power. Image copyright AT&amp;T Image caption AT&amp;T's ""Flying Cow"" drone can stay airborne all day and night This enables the drone stay in the air 24-hours-a-day at a maximum height of 168m (550ft). AT&amp;T says it used Flying COW to provide emergency 4G coverage to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in November. Each drone was able to cover an area measuring 36 sq km. Nokia wants to take things a step further, and turn police vans and fire engines into command and control centres to help emergency responders make crucial decisions much faster than they do today. The idea is for fire engines to have their own personal 4G network with a 50km radius. From the command centre, fire fighters would launch drones and use their cameras to survey the scene. The same concept is being used for search and rescue, with artificial intelligence linking the drones together into a ""swarm"", so only one pilot is needed to direct a whole group of drones. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A Firefighter from a UK Fire and Rescue Service pilots a drone Nokia is testing out the technology with Vodafone and firefighters in Dusseldorf, Germany. ""You don't need to send firemen into the hostile environment, you will have full situational awareness immediately,"" says Thorsten Robrecht, Nokia's vice president of advanced mobile networks solutions. ""What we see from the police is that this is much quicker and lower cost than a helicopter, which they still mostly use today."" Belgian start-up firm Unmanned Life has developed software to send out multiple autonomous drones at the same time to gather information during a crisis, such as when a building is on fire. One drone hovers in the air providing 4G coverage, while another flies around the building providing live video. A third equipped with heat sensors creates a heat map of the building, while a fourth uses sonar to map structural damage. Unmanned Life is in talks to provide its system to BT and Verizon, who currently hold government contracts for emergency communication networks in the UK and US. Swarms of co-operating drones, each with different tasks, help address the flight-time issue because single-function drones can be lighter. And they can be lighter still if many of their computational and sensing functions - navigation for example - are undertaken by computers on the ground ""talking"" to the drones wirelessly. The lighter the drone, the more it can carry. In February, Ericsson tested this concept with BT and Verizon in London to show that a drone could autonomously carry 5kg of medical supplies from one location to another, without human intervention. Image copyright David Tett / Ericsson Image caption A woman watches on a tablet as a man loads a drone with first aid supplies The trial demonstrated that next-generation superfast 5G networks would be powerful enough to transfer data streams between the drone and the ground, as well as ensuring that the connection to the drone never dropped. ""I think drones together with 5G networks and the IoT [internet of things] offer tremendous opportunities,"" says Phil Bonner of Ericsson. ""We need to keep the drone very simple and cheap."" But drones for deliveries and emergency services will only be viable if they can be flown autonomously without crashing into buildings, trees, pylons, or each other. So many tech and telecoms companies are racing to build air traffic control systems for them. ""Nokia has a system run on the 4G network that can connect all the drones and knows where they are,"" says Mr Robrecht. ""And we have a commercial aircraft 4G network covering the entire airspace in Europe in order to connect all the aircraft flying around. ""We're trying to work out how to connect the two networks."" Once this problem is solved, communications drones won't just be for the emergency services. They could help civilians in all sorts of ways too, such as at sports events. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Drones helped fans watching the 2018 Super Bowl enjoy better mobile connectivity ""One of the challenges we see is when people are using their devices in stadiums during the Super Bowl,"" says Art Pregler, AT&amp;T's unmanned aircraft systems programme director. ""If there's a really good football play, they're all taking video or looking for an instant replay. That creates a lot of demand on the network. ""But we could have drones in the air augmenting our existing capacity, and that will improve their experience at the event."" Technology firm Ericsson thinks that in future we could even pay to have a drone launched if we need internet coverage on-demand in an area with bad signal - great for music festivals. Image copyright Magnum Photos The GSMA, which represents the mobile industry, believes it has an essential role to play in the growth of the commercial drone market. But Gartner analyst Aapo Markkanen says: ""The commercial adoption of drones will happen regardless of telcos [telecoms companies]. ""If telcos get involved, that will enable enterprises to do more sophisticated things, but they need to spend money to make money."" Having a drone with their logo on it riding to the rescue will be good for the telco's reputations, but it may not be hugely profitable, believes Kester Mann, a principal analyst at CCS Insight. ""There is some benefit in helping communities, and selling solutions to the public sector is one of them,"" he says. ""But are we going to see governments cough up for these fancy technologies, at a time when purse strings are under pressure?""

Megan Molteni,"Last Wednesday, Hurricane Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle at 155 miles per hour, flattening neighborhoods, turning subdivisions into rubble, and plunging the coast into darkness. On Friday, Trevor Lewis packed up two trucks with crowbars, chainsaws, sledgehammers, ropes, walkie talkies, and five other guys from Cocoa Beach, where he lives on the east side of the state. As night fell they began the drive up into the worst of the wreckage. By 4 am on Saturday they were responding to their first call for help. Lewis leads a self-funded search-and-rescue unit made up of off-duty police officers, firefighters, and EMTs. They call themselves Salty Water Rescue Services, and most of them have special emergency training on the high-speed powerboat racing circuit off Cocoa Beach. Theyre one of hundreds of volunteer crews that showed up post-Michael to help first responders overwhelmed by 911 calls. They used as their guide a service called Crowdsource Rescue, or CSR, which showed on a map individuals who might need help. On one of Salty Waters visits, the crew met a woman whose house had a gas leak, so Lewis called local authorities. Its an eerie feeling to dial that number thinking someones going to come and it goes straight to a busy signal, he says. The womans family had used CSR to request a wellness check on their relative. The idea behind CSR started out simple: collect calls for help posted on social media, geolocate them, and route volunteers to the distressed parties. Basically, Uber for emergencies. It was a simple enough concept that a pair of developers named Matthew Marchetti and Nate Larson hacked it together in about six soggy hours in Houston last August while Hurricane Harvey howled outside. They expected it to help out a few families in their rapidly flooding neighborhood. By the time the storm was over, Marchetti says at least 25,000 people had been reached using the web service. Turns out, armies of spontaneous samaritans can get a lot more done if technology tells them where to go. The volunteers are going to show up no matter what, says Marchetti. Were just trying to empower them to find more people safely and more effectively. What began as a one-off charitable coding sprint has since evolved into a five-person emergency volunteer mission control center. In their day jobs at a real estate company, Marchetti and Larson built maps. And thats basically what the first version of CSR was. But as more hurricanes rocked the US in quick succession in late 2017first Irma, then Mariathe pair piled on new features as problems arose in real-time. We would change something on the site while there were 60,000 people using it, and if they didnt like it, theyd let us know, says Marchetti. We had no master plan. It was all just reactionary. In January, when the hurricane season had ended, they found time for a more thoughtful redesign. The latest version, released two weeks before Florence hit, includes a mobile app and new safeguards. It allows users to tag hazards such as downed power lines, washed-out roads, and fast-moving water. It also gives CSR the flexibility to block off any areas that emergency management officials have declared dangerous for civilians, so that volunteers without proper training cant see aid requests in those areas. Those precautions are to prevent volunteers from winding up needing rescuing themselves. Thats less of a concern for volunteers like Lewiss Salty Water crew, who used CSR for the first time during Florence, but who are no strangers to treacherous waters. After that September storm swept through, seven of their guys drove to North Carolina with a flat-bottom boat and two tuned-up jet skis with rescue sleds on the back. Over the course of a few sleepless days they checked in on nearly 100 people, delivering supplies, relaying messages to loved ones, and helping the unluckiest few to safety, including about a dozen shivering pets. On the long drive back to Cocoa Beach they decided to formally partner up with the crowdsource platform. But when Michael arrived two months later with its powerful Category 4 winds, Lewis and his teammates had used up most of their vacation time responding to Florence, so they could only stay four days. They had AT&amp;T, which Lewis says was the only carrier with coverage, and switched to walkie-talkies when they hit areas with service outages. If they couldn't relay their findings back to worried families directly, they'd take pictures or video to share using their phones later. He says that in the time they were in Panhandle, his team reached more than 300 people using the app. Yet the rescue that sticks in his mind most vividly wasnt coordinated by CSR. It came about just by chance. She was the neighbor of someone whose family had filed a wellness request; Lewis spotted her as they were preparing to move on to the next ticket, and he asked if she was alright. It soon became clear she wasnt. A widow in her 80s and frail, she lived alone. There was almost no food or water in her house. A section of her roof had been ripped clear of its frame. An immigrant from Thailand, she had no family in the US. No one was looking for her. She had one friend in the city, but with no phone service she couldnt call her. It was heart wrenching, says Lewis. His team reached the friend and waited until she came to pick the old woman up. Then they patched her roof and ripped out her wet carpet, collected her valuables and put them in a safe place to dry. They filed a new CSR ticket so that there was a record. And so that someone follows up. But the incident showed one of the apps biggest limitationson its own it cant locate missing people. Being homeless, phoneless, family-less, or Facebook-less can make dangerous storms even more deadly in the days and weeks after the worst weather has passed. Thats one of the reasons Marchettis team has started to layer social vulnerability indices and flood zones onto its maps of areas where hurricanes are expected to hit. As landfall predictions firm up, CSR places Facebook ads for its app targeted at people living in the path of the storm. They start making calls to churches and local community organizations, trying to raise awareness of the resource. We want to play this role of equalizer, to come in serve as a stopgap, he says. Not having the ability or the funds to evacuate doesnt mean you dont deserve to be helped. Early Wednesday morning, CSR had more than 1,200 open tickets for people not yet verified as safe. But as more people got cell service and volunteers cleared a backlog of requests, that number dropped to 548 by the end of the day. Marchetti says that doesnt necessarily mean that all of those people really are missing and presumed dead. They could be staying with other friends or relatives and unable to communicate. But we are starting to hit that point in every disaster where that number becomes more and more representative of the real thing, he says. A more official number could emerge as soon as Thursday evening, when the Federal Emergency Management Agency expects to complete its search and rescue operations. The agency has 10 crews and a dozen cadaver-sniffing dogs scouring the destruction scattered across Bay, Gulf, and Jackson counties, according to FEMA spokesperson Ruben Brown, reached Wednesday at the agencys interim operating facility in Tallahassee. State officials have not provided a count of the people currently considered to be missing. The states division of emergency management has an online system where people can report missing individuals as well as the locations of people who are trapped or running out of medications and other supplies. But Florida officials did not respond to questions about how those lists are used to coordinate searches. The states website also links to a searchable American Red Cross registry where people can list themselves as safe and well for their loved ones to find.

However, the deal was reportedly terminated after it was found the firm's debt was $280m (£201.4m) rather than the $225m previously disclosed. The company was co-founded by disgraced US movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. Mr Weinstein is facing dozens of allegations of sexual abuse, including rape, but he denies non-consensual sex.

Jason Kehe,"Look at all the pretty drones. Hovering above sports stadiums from Houston to Pyeongchang, many hundreds of them have lately sparkled in artful murmuration. On a recent Time magazine cover, 958 drones pixelated the sky. The world record, 1,374 LED-bedazzled microbots, was set by Chinese company EHang UAV in May. So-called drone swarms—the phrase people have taken up with gusto—are having their biggest, buzziest year ever. It’s an evocative word, swarms, and innocuous enough when applied to one of Intel’s drone light shows. But it’s tinged with alarm—if drones can dance at twilight, they can also attack. Sure enough, a gang outside Denver sent a small fleet to harass FBI agents on a raid earlier this year. In Syria, rebels reportedly sicced a squadron of quadrotors on a Russian base. To the media, both events were swarms. Take comfort, then, in this buzzkill: “The swarm is really an illusion,” says Mac Schwager, an assistant professor at Stanford who studies multi­robot systems. Schwager, along with many of his colleagues, resists the word. Too entomological, conjuring as it does frillions of bugs surging as a single superorganism through the air. ( Flocking birds, in fact, were the field’s original inspiration—though the occasional roboticist does try studying insects.) When drones “swarm,” on the other hand, they’ve been choreographed in advance, or else are being controlled by human minders with joysticks. Even the DOD’s recent military demos have required teleoperators. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Drones Not that researchers at MIT, ETH Zurich, and elsewhere aren’t trying to imbue drones with hive-mindedness. In Schwager’s lab, small groups of five or 10 really can sync their movements, powered by so-called decentralized algorithms that tell each bot where its buddies are in space and time. But fully autonomous systems, Schwager says, are “sort of in the R&amp;D phase.” More removed still are drones that can actively learn from one another and derive unprogrammed behaviors from their esoteric robo-chatter. The 2017 web film Slaughterbots perpetuates such unrealities. In it, an intelligent drone fleet tears through a college campus, murdering students. Never mind that quadrotors aren’t capable of navigating indoors, where GPS signals can’t propagate. The point of the short, which was screened late last year at a UN weapons convention in Geneva and has been viewed on YouTube more than 2.5 million times, is to scarify the notion of robots working together. Linked up, they’ll inevitably become a locust plague on humankind. Except that’s how teams of drones will one day be able to survey natural disasters, rescue survivors, clean up oceans, farm fields, explore other planets, and deliver your burritos. Networking isn’t inherently evil. Nora Ayanian, a roboticist at USC, imagines a scenario in which every bot is programmed slightly differently, so that when they’re deployed en masse, the smartest among them teaches the pack how to act. Ayanian calls it “leveraging diversity in the control policy,” an engineer’s way of saying that more perspectives means better results. Diversity matters, even in machines.

Darrell Etherington,"One day, they may yet turn against us, but for now, they’re still our allies: A drone rescued two teenage swimmers in distress off the course of New South Wales in Australia, according to a new report. The drone spotted two teenagers in trouble around a half-a-mile out from shore, and then dropped a flotation device it carries for the purpose to give them something to hang on to (via Verge ). This drone was actually not supposed to be saving anyone just yet – it was engaged in a pilot project to test its viability. But the Sydney Morning Herald reports that when a call came through about the swimmers in trouble, the drone happened to be in the Ari and nearby, positioned well to respond. The drone’s pilot, a decorated veteran lifeguard for New South Wales, was able to Gert out to the swimmers’ position, and drop the pod in a minute or two, which is at least a few minutes less than it would’ve taken to respond directly with actual flesh and blood lifeguards. This training exercise was designed to get lifeguard staff familiar with the so-called “Little Ripper” drone, which is part of a government plan to help mitigate the risk of shark attacks. Its ability to save the swimmers was an accident, but a lucky accident that definitely helps prove its viability as part of the $16 million government program.

Catherine Shu,"Elon Musk seems not only intent on burning all the goodwill he earned for trying to help last week’s Thai cave rescue, but rolling around in its ashes, too. In a series of extraordinarily offensive, now deleted tweets, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO called a British diver who participated in last week’s dangerous rescue mission a “pedo guy,” adding in another tweet “bet ya a signed dollar it’s true.” Musk’s tantrum was triggered by an interview the diver, Vern Unsworth, gave CNN International last Friday, in which he said Musk could stick the small submarine he had SpaceX engineers build “where it hurts.” Though the submarine was intended to help the 12 boys stranded with their soccer coach navigate flooded cave passageways, Unsworth, who helped plan the rescue operation and recruited other cave diving experts, said it “had absolutely no chance of working.” Unworth added that Musk “had no conception of what the cave passage was like. The submarine, I believe, was about 5 foot 6 long, rigid, so it wouldn’t have gone round corners or round any obstacles. It wouldn’t hadn’t have made the first 50 meters into the cave from the dive start point.” When the reporter mentioned that Musk had gone into the cave on Tuesday, Unsworth said he was “asked to leave very quickly. And so he should have been.” The rescue mission, made even more challenging by monsoon season, claimed the life of a Thai Navy seal before all boys were saved last week. This is not the first time that Musk has clashed with a member of the cave rescue team. As confirmation came in that the last group of boys and their coach had been freed on July 10, the head of the rescue mission, Narongsak Osatanakorn, told reporters that “although [Musk’s] technology is good and sophisticated it’s not practical for this mission.” In response, Musk dismissed the credentials of Ostanakorn, who led the joint command center coordinating the operation and is former acting governor of Chiang Rai, the province where the cave is located. In a tweet he said Ostanakorn was “described inaccurately as ‘rescue chief'” and “is not the subject matter expert” ( the Columbus Dispatch reports that Ostanakorn holds a Master’s degree from Ohio State University, where he studied geodetic engineering and surveying). Though Musk’s tweet about Ostanakorn was sharply criticized, many still gave him credit for his efforts. After all, engineering a submarine in a few days to save a group of children is an impressive and laudable feat. While Musk is known for going on strange Twitter rants, however, his attack on Unsworth is an entirely different stratosphere. In addition to defaming Unsworth in a particularly heinous way, the implication that a British diver would only go to Thailand, one of the world’s top diving destinations, for child sex tourism is problematic and arguably racist, as many have pointed out.

Five months later, it is now one of the most visited spots in northern Thailand.
Back in July, a massive pumping operation to lower the water levels inside the caves was sucking out millions of litres an hour, water which cascaded down the hill, flooding the surrounding fruit and vegetable fields.
One of them was used by Archawin Mopoaku, an ethnic Akha, one of several hill-tribe minorities living in the area, to grow pineapples. But he did not complain. Instead, he abandoned farming for a while, and volunteered, cutting bamboo to help the army carry supplies up to the cave entrance.
Today Archawin's pineapple field lies untilled. And next to it, on the unpaved road climbing up to the caves, he sells oranges from his orchard to tourists, a venture he says is making him a lot more money than his pineapples ever did.

 Archawin Mopoaku: ""Hill-tribe people like me are doing well""
""Before the rescue it was very quiet around here"", he said. ""Only once in a while a few foreigners would come up to explore the caves. But after the rescue there are far more people coming, and hill-tribe people like me are doing well.""
So are the flower sellers calling out to customers at the entrance to the road, the snack vendors grilling pork, the souvenir stalls and, in particular, the lottery ticket sellers.
A park ranger sits on a plastic chair under a palm-thatch canopy, keeping a hand-written list of the visitor numbers. That used to be easy. Typically they would get 10 or 20 a day. Now it is more than 6,000.
Most of them are Thais, coming from all corners of the country to see where the rescue took place.
""Right now, no other tourist attraction in this region can compete with Tham Luang,"" said Damron Puttan, a magazine publisher and TV personality who was visiting. He was travelling in Europe when the story broke in June, he said, and he was struck by how much attention it was getting over there.
""I never knew about these caves before the rescue"", said Vanisa Achakulvisut. ""But after all the news about the Wild Boars football team, I had to come and see it for myself.""

 Wild Boars coach Ekkapol Chantawong and rescuer Mikko Paasi met again in early December
It isn't just curiosity drawing in the crowds. The mountain range above the caves is named after Nang Non, a mythical princess who killed herself over an illicit love affair, and whose sleeping form the mountain is said to resemble. Caves are traditionally viewed as places of great mystical power in Thailand.
There has long been a shrine to Nang Non, next to the cave entrance, where people could make offerings to her spirit. But the seemingly miraculous rescue has enhanced her allure as a bestower of good fortune.
Every visitor I saw came clutching flowers, and said a short prayer at the shrine. It is now a lucky place to buy lottery tickets, and the most popular numbers end in 13, the number of boys and their coach who were trapped in the cave. 
Now they have another shrine: a three-metre-high bronze statue of Saman Gunan, the Thai diver who died during the rescue.
Image caption
 The rescued boys turned up at the unveiling of a memorial to Saman Gunan this month
I watched them position it in front of a new, and still empty museum, built in the once mud-filled car park from where we had reported the search and rescue effort earlier this year.
The boys, and coach Ekkapol Chantawong, who had helped them endure their 17 days underground by teaching them to meditate, were there as well, only their second visit to the cave since they were brought out.
Some of their rescuers had come too. Mikko Paasi, a Finnish diver who helped lay supplies for the final recue, American Josh Morris, who runs a climbing school in Chiang Mai and was a crucial intermediary between the foreign divers and senior Thai officials, and Vern Unsworth, the British caver who has spent years exploring Tham Luang, and one of the first on the scene after the boys went missing.
It was a moving reunion; 12 boys, looking fit and cheerful, whose lives, against such tremendous odds, were saved, now hugging their saviours.
The Thai government is still very protective of them. They have child welfare officers with them in all their public appearances, and anyone wishing to interview them must go through weeks of rigorous screening by two committees. Their families too have been instructed not to speak without official permission.
Media captionVern Unsworth was one of the divers who helped rescue the Wild Boars
""For me it's still quite emotional"", Vern Unsworth told me, as we looked at the new green fence now blocking visitors from entering the cave. ""Some people think that to get 13 out of 13 out was a bit of a miracle.
""I think the world outside was expecting a bad result. But we never gave up. What the divers did was just an incredible feat of endurance.""
No-one should blame the boys or their coach for going in, he said. They were just very unlucky. ""It could have been me."" Vern had planned to go into the caves the day after. The water inside rose very suddenly, after unusually heavy rainfall that day, trapping the boys and coach Ek, and driving them deeper into the caves.
Has the experience changed their lives? ""They are an amazing group"", Vern said. ""They have stayed level-headed, they are being well looked after. I wouldn't call it a normal life - they have been on tour around the world. But they are all back at school.""
Their head coach Nopparat Kanthawong said they were all training hard after school, just as they were before the rescue. They have regained the weight they lost, he said, although they are still rebuilding their muscle strength. There is plenty of interest from groups keen to help them; we watched a coaching team from Manchester City train them on their hillside football pitch.
At least three projects to make feature films based on the rescue are under way. The first, named The Cave, has just finished filming. Vern and the other divers hope the cave site and the museum can be used for public education about the geology, flora and fauna in the surrounding area.

 The entrance to the Tham Luang caves is now sealed off
For the top official in Mae Sai, district chief Somsak Kanakham, all the additional income and business opportunities from the mini tourist boom at the caves are very welcome, in a poor, largely rural part of Thailand.
He does worry, though, about how to keep the momentum going. The area needs better infrastructure to cope with the tide of visitors, and the extra traffic, he said.
Longer term, he hopes to get outside advice on how to develop other potential tourist attractions in this pleasant green and mountainous area. At some point all the excitement generated by this extraordinary rescue will start to fade, and with it, perhaps the visitor numbers too.",What happened to the 12 boys and their football coach rescued from a flooded Thai cave in July?,2018-12-25T23:05:12Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",The Thai cave rescue: What happened next?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46538252,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06dh9m5.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,rescue,1
Jane Merrick,"Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN) Given that her previous annual speech to members of her party was an unmitigated disaster for Theresa May, the bar for this year was pretty low. The British Prime Minister wanted to show her Conservative Party -- and the country -- that there is more to her government than the tortuous Brexit negotations, with some optimism about the future. Instead, she far exceeded their expectations, delighting members of Parliament and activists from the first minute: the normally rigid, awkward Prime Minister came onto the conference stage to ABBA's ""Dancing Queen, "" breaking out some moves as she approached the lectern. The idea to open her speech this way -- making light of her stilted dances during a trip to South Africa in August -- was all hers. Widely mocked for being robotic in persona and intransigent in policy, May decided to take ownership, self-deprecatingly, of her flaws. But it was also her opportunity to show the Conservative Party -- including her arch-critic Boris Johnson -- that she is still in charge of the Brexit process and has authority over her government. It was a tough ask. Privately, her allies had been just hoping she would make it to the end of the speech, and the end of the four-day conference in Birmingham, without mishap -- which last year included a persistent cough, the set behind her falling apart and a stage invasion by someone handing her the British equivalent of a pink slip. It was that last incident that seemed, at the time, the most portentous -- foreshadowing her resignation over Brexit. Yet that resignation never came. That is not to say the last year has been an easy one for May. It has been a turbulent 12 months, bookended by these two pivotal speeches. Of course, May did not resign, but seven of her Cabinet ministers walked out, for various reasons. Two of those resignations were potentially the most damaging, because they were in direct opposition to her so-called Chequers plan for withdrawal from the EU: Boris Johnson as foreign secretary and David Davis as Brexit secretary. The work of her government has seemed stymied by Brexit. Negotiations with Brussels have been slow and difficult, forcing the PM to take personal charge of the talks this summer. Last month, she took her Chequers plan to a summit in Salzburg where it was rebuffed by fellow EU leaders. Though this was a serious blow to her credibility, the next day May came out fighting, demanding respect from the EU. This lack of support has been much closer to home, too. Since his resignation in July, Johnson has engaged in regular attacks against the Prime Minister over Brexit, most recently in a packed-out event at the conference on Tuesday, when his call to ""chuck Chequers"" was cheered by pro-Brexit Tory activists. Yet despite rapturous applause for the former Foreign secretary, many of his fellow Conservative MPs saw this attempt to overshadow the PM as an act of disloyalty. Similarly, a Tory MP who lodged a letter calling for a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, minutes before May was due on stage, was dismissed by his colleagues as ill-timed and disloyal. The Prime Minister had two main messages: one for her party and one for the country. On the first, she made clear she would not change tack on Chequers, despite escalating calls from Brexiteer Tory MPs, and from remain supporters who want a second referendum. The result of the 2016 EU referendum must be honored and she would not shift on the issue of breaking up the United Kingdom -- something that would be under threat if the alternative plan floated by Johnson and other Brexiteers were agreed. On the second, she tried to pitch to the center ground, appealing to voters who are disaffected by the opposition Labour leader's hard left-wing, anti-business policies. She pledged the Tories would be a ""party for the whole country"" that was ""decent, moderate and patriotic."" Her performance was strong enough to see off her critics inside the Conservative Party -- for now. Yet in a week's time, the next round of Brexit negotiations between the UK and Brussels takes place at which there is supposed to be significant progress made towards a deal. During her party conference, which was being watched closely by EU chiefs back in Brussels, there were reports that the UK might agree to stay in the customs union beyond the end of the Brexit transition phase at the end of 2020. If that is on the cards, May did not make mention of it in her speech -- presumably to keep her party inside the hall onside. Yet the UK will need to make concessions to break the deadlock on Brexit next week. The Prime Minister has survived her toughest year so far -- but an even tougher one lies ahead.","Given that her previous annual speech to members of her party was an unmitigated disaster for Theresa May, the bar for this year was pretty low.",2018-10-03T12:48:19Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",ABBA's 'Dancing Queen' to the rescue,https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/03/opinions/theresa-mays-year-jane-merrick-opinion-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181003080715-theresa-may-8-3-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,rescue,1
Josh Ocampo,"I spend at least an hour a day scrolling through my Instagram feed, looking at pictures of cats. I send photos of cute rescue cats with names like Moo and Bathmat to my friends. I ask people about their cats a lot, too. Does she shed a lot? Can you send me photos?
The thing isIm severely allergic to cats. If I pet my friend Suvis cat, Graham, my eyes will swell shut. If I stay in a room with Graham too long, Ill have trouble breathing.
Id always wanted a cat, and very recently, was confronted with an existence without my very own Graham. Is there anything I can do to cope with a cat allergy as a prospective owner? As it turns out, yes, but itll be a long road ahead. 
Confirm your allergy with a doctor
According to David Erstein, an allergist-immunologist at Allergy and Asthma Wellness, if youre unsure if youre allergic to cats, usually, there are some pretty obvious symptoms. 
If youre going into a home with cats, feeling off, congested, or sneezing, chances are youre allergic, he said. Some people can have other reactions including asthma issues. Thats where we fall into bigger problems.
But if you want to be absolutely 100% positive, seeing a doctor is probably your best bet. The easiest thing to do is to see an allergy doctor so you can do a quick allergy test, he said. The test can be performed in a couple of minutes, and after about 20-30 minutes, you get to figure out if you have any allergies. Its a pretty safe test to do and is the most objective way to get a professionals opinion.
Once youve confirmed via an allergy test, it then becomes your decision whether or not to adopt and endure a life of sneezing. And if you are, you do have some options when it comes to lessening your nightmarish reactions.
Datings hard enough. Add a severe food allergy and the prospect of a swollen air passage in the

Use preventative reduction strategies
So youre allergic and decided to adopt a rescue cat anyway, hurray! According to Erstein, your first few steps should be to practice some good allergy reduction strategies, which involves setting up your home appropriately.
First, youll have to set some ground rules with the cat, he said. Youll want to make sure the cat doesnt have free reign in the house, and keep them out of areas like the bedroom, so you arent going to sleep with cat dander in the room. 
Your next step should be to purchase an air purifier with a HEPA filter or High-Efficiency Particulate Air filter, he said. Devices with a HEPA filter help remove allergens in the air. Cat dander is one of the smallest types of allergens out there. Its very airborne and remains suspended in the air for a while, he added. That air purifier will be able to filter out that dander. It should be running non-stop in the home, where your cat is, and where you frequent.
And lastly, if its possible, bathe your cat one to two times a weekyes, for some cat-owners, attempting to bathe them is a death wish, so only do this if you arent at risk of getting injured in some way. And of course, wash your hands whenever possible. The things people are allergic to in cats could be in their skin, in their fur, their saliva, he said. Make sure you wash your hands and dont touch your eyes or youll be suffering.
I love dog and cat transformation videos on YouTube.

Use over the counter medications
According to Erstein, your next step to try over the counter medications. People can take daily oral antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays, he said. Medications, all in all, are kind of just like band-aids to the symptoms, though. Theyre not really doing anything to solve the sensitivity that people have.
You can also visit an allergist who can prescribe you nasal sprays or other medication, in case these medicines arent working.
And if youre wondering if its bad to rely on some of these OTC medications long-term, you shouldnt be too concerned, according to Erstein. These medications have been around a long time and theyre well tolerated, he said There are rare side effects; sometimes people get very tired or it dries people out. But if youre willing to put up with it, people can tolerate it though youre not going to be 100%.
Get allergy shots
If you want to try something a little more drastic, Erstein recommended seeing a doctor to get allergy shots or immunotherapy. In essence, were giving you shots of your allergies in very small amounts (or microdoses) and every time we give you a higher concentration, were building up the amount your body tolerates, almost like a vaccine, he said. We call it disease-modifying. Its a very good way to buildup the immune system, so people develop a tolerance to the thing theyre allergic to.
These shots, however, come with a huge time commitment and arent always full-proof. They take months before you start to feel benefits, he said. The standard way of treating is once a week for six to seven months or so. Eventually, youre coming in once a month. Its not a forever thing, but if you want long lasting changes, we recommend people be on it for three to five years. Its a big commitment and I cant say that it helps everybody, but we say it helps about 80% of people, but whats nice is that it also helps things from getting worse.
Its officially spring. Along with the flowers, sunshine, and Creme-egg runs, for the allergic

Dont believe the hypoallergenic cat hype
Despite what you may have heard about a certain breed of cat being better for your allergies, for the most part, it wont make that much of a difference if at all, Erstein said. 
Unfortunately, theres really no such thing, he said. The data isnt great. There are reports that certain cats like male cats might release more allergens, but all in all, theyre all going to have that dander that youre reacting to. Its a little bit of snake oil. Most allergists would just say cross your fingers.
As for developing an immunity (or an allergy) to cats down the road, it is possible, though its mostly a gray area. Building up an immunity via allergy shots is a better solution than hoping you might develop one through exposure, however.
And if youre still unsure about adopting a cat, Erstein recommends one simple tool: Spend time with one. You want to babysit a cat if you can for a couple of weeks, just to see how things are, he said. Take an antihistamine daily, have a nasal spray around, and see how you do. If its tolerable, then you can say to yourself Im okay with doing this. And if its not tolerable or your symptoms are more severe, at that point youd really have to ask the question, Do I want the cat enough? I have many patients that are willing to do it. They love the cat that much and I get it, I completely doits a tough decision.

MEG FELLING and REMY TUMIN,"The Fifth Annual International Cotillion raised $8,000 for Yorkie911. Published On Aug. 24, 2018 At the Fifth Annual International Cotillion, 70 entrants strutted their stuff to benefit rescue animals. ZZ couldn’t stop smiling all night. Her pink and white organza gown swooshed behind her as she sashayed through the New Yorker Hotel. Pearls dripped from the top of her tiara to the end of her train. She looked determined to take home the night’s crown title: Miss Cotillion. “I know she’s happy, and I know she likes the dress,” said Ilene Zeines, dressed in a more demure black strapless gown. “If she doesn’t like the dress, she is not going to wear it. She is going to bite me.” ZZ the maltipoo is a regular on the dog gala circuit. Published On Aug. 24, 2018 Oh right. We should probably mention here that ZZ is a maltipoo. Ms. Zeines, her owner, has entered her in a number of dog fashion competitions and events. ZZ was one of 70 dogs that participated in the Fifth Annual International Cotillion on Aug. 11. Produced by GGirl Productions, the cotillion and similar events have raised more than $120,000 for dog rescue groups around the country in the last four years. This month’s event raised $8,000 for Yorkie911. Seventy dogs, many of whom are rescues, participated in the Fifth Annual International Cotillion on Aug. 11. Published On Aug. 24, 2018 Nearly all of the participants were rescue dogs themselves and had traveled from as far as Morocco and the Philippines to participate. Some of the canine participants have bigger wardrobes than many humans. Published On Aug. 24, 2018 “It’s a family,” Laura Souza, the founder of GGirl Productions, said. “It takes you out of the world and away from all of your problems. You get to spend quality time with this little thing that loves you unconditionally. That’s the magic.” Laura Souza, the founder of GGirl Productions, was the organizer of the event and many others of its kind. Published On Aug. 24, 2018 Sure. It’s also very much a competition. “They all love each other,” Ms. Souza, who owns four Shih Tzus, said. “But when the contest comes on, the gloves come off.” The owners take great pains to make their dogs look as fabulous as possible before the judging starts. Published On Aug. 24, 2018 The dogs were judged in three categories: clothing, accessories and behavior. If a dog didn’t look comfortable in its costume, it would cost them points. “You are looking for the Cary Grant and Grace Kelly of the evening,” Ms. Souza said. The judges had one minute to inspect each dog in the two hours before the cotillion began. “They’ll try to sell you on the sympathy vote,” Ms. Souza said, by telling you rescue stories and tear jerk moments. Don’t fall for it, she cautioned. The judges had one minute to inspect each dog in the two hours before the cotillion began. Published On Aug. 24, 2018 Their looks included a dress inspired by an Alexander McQueen design to a copy of Prince Harry’s wedding tuxedo, but with more sequins and silk. Cooper the Pomeranian was dressed as a time traveler, complete with goggles, and Penelope the yorkie’s “summer romantic dress” was bedazzled in not one but 10,000 hand sewn Swarovski crystals. Some of their outfits cost upward of $300. That’s quite a gown, Penelope. Published On Aug. 24, 2018 Gertie, a 3-year-old Biewer terrier and former Miss Cotillion, was wearing what her owner Melanie Johnston described as a “living love gown.” “The goose feathers look like they’re moving in the wind,” Ms. Johnston said. Gertie has her own bedroom at their home in Madison, Miss., Ms. Johnston said, including two walk-in closets which contain more than 50 gowns and 100 casual outfits, plus 100 accessories. Everything is custom-made. Cute! Published On Aug. 24, 2018 All of the dogs were required to wear undergarments, called bellybands, while in the hotel in order to avoid any accidents. Some wore pantaloons to disguise the diaper guard. Coco Chanel, a Chihuahua, and her owner Adrian Stephen Cabuhat flew all the way from Manila to participate in their first international competition. They’ve already cleaned up at all the major dog fashion competitions in the Philippines. Her gown featured flowers hand sewn to her long skirt, inspired by the Kadayawan Festival, an annual celebration in Davao. Her necklace included rice pearls only found in the Philippines. It’s all about balance. Published On Aug. 24, 2018 “Being a pet fashion lover is a different thing,” he said. “You get to show your creativity and have the bonding time with others who share the same interests as you.” From the tiniest of dogs with the longest of trains like Coco Chanel, to the largest of dogs with extra long trains, like Carly the miniature Shar Pei. Carly was the only “full-figured” contestant, Ms. Souza said. Carly’s headband kept sliding around on her thick wrinkles. Published On Aug. 24, 2018 “It’s a lot of extra work because she touched the ground all the time,” Mindy Gottesman of Jupiter, Florida said. “But she loves it. When she sees the clothes comes out, both her and her brother Dino, they go crazy.” Carly wore a design by Darlene Hachey that made use of antique wedding fabric and appliquéd organza flowers. It was her first design for a larger dog. Carly’s matching headband kept sliding around on her thick wrinkles. Fun! Published On Aug. 24, 2018 One by one, owners and their dogs made their way down the catwalk before a parade of flashes. The smallest dogs in the room were carried down the red carpet, their dresses draped over their owners shoulders to fully display scope of the design. Afterward they feasted on Dog Perignon and bowls of rice. Their humans had salmon. Then it was time to present the awards. Yum! Published On Aug. 24, 2018 The winner of Miss Cotillion went to Lovi Garbo. Mr. Cotillion was Rudy Travolta. Lovi wore an elaborate butterfly costume with embroidered flowers and wings. Rudy donned a white satin tuxedo lined with rhinestones, after his namesake’s character in “Saturday Night Fever.” Congrats, winners! Published On Aug. 24, 2018 The owners grasped their trophies in one hand and escorted their dogs with the other down the runway to a live rendition of Kelly Clarkson’s “A Moment Like This.” Show ’em off! Published On Aug. 24, 2018 Other awards were handed out for best accessories, best furboy tux and best furgirl gown. The award for Gentle Furboy went to Tommy the Pomeranian, a 6-month-old rescue. At the end of the day, everyone’s a winner. Published On Aug. 24, 2018 ZZ won Miss Congeniality. Ms. Zeines, her owner, was … surprised. “We’re a little edgy sometimes.

Jamie Rigg,"The drones weren't just used to disorientate the FBI, though. According to Mazel, they were the crew's eyes in the sky, pushing video to YouTube so the wider group could keep tabs on the FBI's movements. This was an organized operation, too. Apparently, the drones were brought into the area specifically to disrupt the FBI's rescue efforts. Other specifics of the incident remain ""law-enforcement sensitive,"" Mazel said, but this is just one of many more elaborate ways drones are now being used by criminals. Surveillance is a big part of it. Criminals have taken to watching police stations to identify witnesses and other friends of the law, as well as casing out facilities to find security holes they may be able to exploit in a robbery. A group in Australia uses drones to watch port authority staff. If they get too close to one of the gang's contraband-filled shipping containers, a fire or theft report is called in to redirect attention. Border scouts and drug muling drones continue to be a problem, too. Just a few months ago, Chinese law enforcement said they'd shut down a smartphone smuggling ring that was responsible for illegally transporting nearly $80 million in handsets. It's a game of cat and mouse at the moment. While there is plenty of development going into anti-drone measures, the tech typically can't be deployed quickly or safely in many reactive scenarios. The FAA is hoping tighten the screw on criminals with stricter regulations. In addition to having to register your drone, the FAA is exploring the idea of a remote identification system whereby drones would be required to broadcast a unique ID linking them to their owner. Ford put forward its idea for such a system last month. The automaker believes anti-collision lights on drones could have the added function of flashing a unique code that could be read by a mobile app. Instead of requiring drones to broadcast a radio signal or similar, this system would be cheap to implement and could potentially be retrofitted to existing models.","Drones are what you make of them.

On one occasion, I came home to find that she’d eaten a five-pound bag of flour. She was covered in white powder, and flour pawprints were everywhere. I asked the dog what had happened, and Indy just looked at me with a glance that said, “I cannot imagine what you are referring to.” Time passed. Our boys grew up and went off to college. I left my job at Colby College in Maine and joined the faculty at Barnard College in New York. My mother died at age 94. The mirror, which had reflected a young mom when Indigo first barged through the door, now showed a woman in late middle age. I had surgery for cataracts. I began to lose my hearing. We all turned gray: me, my spouse, the dogs. This summer, I took Indigo for one last walk. She was slow and unsteady on her paws. She looked up at me mournfully. “You did say you’d take care of me, when the time came,” her eyes said. “You promised.” She died on an August afternoon, a tennis ball at her side. Sometimes, this autumn, I’d find myself looking for her, as if she might be sleeping in one of my children’s empty bedrooms. But she wasn’t there. When you lose a dog, you not only lose the animal that has been your friend, you also lose a connection to the person you have been. For a dozen years, Indigo had been a constant, part of the glue that held us together. Now she was gone. Then one day I got a call from the place where we board our dogs when we are out of town, a “bed ’n’ biscuit” called Willow Run. One of their customers was dying of cancer. Her dog, Chloe, was a black lab, and she needed a home. We rolled our eyes. They had to be kidding. We were in mourning, and we were pretty sure we didn’t want another big dog, especially an older one, and we were just too banged up. We told them we were sorry, but no. Then, one weekend when I picked up Ranger after an overnight at Willow Run, I met Chloe. Her face was soft. I asked, maybe I could just take her home for a day? You know how this story ends. Over three million dogs enter animal shelters in the United States annually. Many of them are strays that are returned to their owners; 1.6 million other dogs are adopted. But more than 600,000 dogs are euthanized every year because they do not have a home. People wanting to adopt a pet can contact one of the many organizations working on animal rescue: the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, AdoptAPet.com, the Humane Society. When Chloe entered our house, she was cautious and uncertain. She spent hours that first day going to every corner, sniffing things out. At the end of the day she sat down by the fireplace and gave me a look. “If you wanted,” she seemed to say, “I would stay with you.” Ranger has a new wing-dog. I had hopes of having a conversation with Chloe’s owner, trying to learn what their history had been. I wanted to bring Chloe over to her house so that her owner could know that her dog had a good home, so that the two of them could have a proper farewell. When I finally got through, though, I learned that Chloe’s owner had died the week before. It snowed that night, and I woke up in a room made mysterious by light and stillness. In the morning I sat up and found that Chloe had climbed into bed with us as we slept. “Well?,” she asked. I touched her soft ears in the bright, quiet room and thought about the gift of grace. “If you wanted,” I said, “I would stay with you, too.” Continue reading the main story",It’s true what they ask about rescue animals: Who saved whom?,2017-12-27T10:45:16Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Contributing Op-Ed Writer: Inside of a Dog,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/opinion/rescue-animals-dogs-adopt.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/27/opinion/27boylan2web/27boylan2web-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,rescue,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai, who is detained in China, gave a video interview in which he condemned Stockholm. It's not clear if he was speaking under duress. State media in China have accused Sweden of a movie-style plot to spirit away detained bookseller Gui Minhai, who has Swedish citizenship. The Hong Kong-based businessman was seized on 20 January while travelling to the Chinese capital, Beijing. On Friday a video interview was released in which he accused Stockholm of ""sensationalising"" his case. A Chinese tabloid condemned Sweden for trying to ""demonstrate its diplomatic heroism by 'saving the bookseller'"". Mr Gui, who was briefly freed from custody last October, has been in and out of Chinese detention since 2015, when he went missing during a holiday in Thailand. What is the Chinese press saying? The Global Times, a nationalistic paper, accused Sweden of tricking Mr Gui into a plan designed to free him from Chinese custody. It says the bookseller was banned from leaving the Chinese mainland over allegations he had been involved in ""illegal business"". The 53-year-old was arrested while taking a train to Beijing from Ningbo in eastern China, where doctors had said he might have the neurological disorder ALS, a type of motor neurone disease. He had been scheduled to see a Swedish specialist in the capital, and was arrested in the presence of two Swedish diplomats travelling with him. In an editorial headlined, ""Is Sweden making 'Saving Gui Minhai' movie?"", the Global Times says Stockholm ""wanted to arrange Gui's 'escape' by breaking Chinese law"".

The Global Times accused the Swedish foreign ministry of ""craving the limelight in the EU and the West"", and said it had made itself ""a laughingstock"". Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported that Mr Gui had ""applied to authorities and asked to speak the truth before media"". What's the problem with the video? In the video, Mr Gui says he was pressured into leaving China by Swedish officials. ""Because they were instigating me non-stop, I fell for it,"" he says. Human rights groups including Amnesty International have warned that the interview has the hallmarks of a forced confession. ""Looking back, I might have become Sweden's chess piece,"" Mr Gui says in the footage. ""My wonderful life has been ruined and I would never trust the Swedish ever again."" Katarina Byrenius, a spokeswoman for Sweden's foreign ministry, has said the video ""changes nothing"". ""We continue to demand that our citizen be given the opportunity to meet with Swedish diplomatic staff and medical staff,"" she wrote in an email to Reuters news agency. ""It's almost certainly a forced confession,"" said William Nee, a China researcher with Amnesty International. Skip Twitter post by @williamnee Amnesty International continues to call for the release of Gui Minhai, and for him to be granted adequate medical care and access to consular officials and lawyers of his choice. This sort of contrived video and media interview made in incommunicado detention is shameful. — William Nee (@williamnee) February 9, 2018 End of Twitter post by @williamnee ""The fact that he's kind of repeating talking points that the [Chinese] government wants to put out... and as far as we know he's in incommunicado detention. He doesn't have lawyers of his choice or consular access right now,"" he told Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK. What's the background? Mr Gui, who has published books on the personal lives of Chinese Communist Party leaders, has spent much of the past two years in Chinese custody. He first made headlines in 2015 when he vanished from Thailand and resurfaced in China, along with four other Hong Kong-based publishers. After his disappearance, there were allegations that he had been abducted by Chinese agents across international borders in an extrajudicial process. Chinese officials, however, say Mr Gui and the four other men all went to China voluntarily. The bookseller ultimately confessed to being involved in a fatal traffic accident more than a decade earlier - a confession supporters say was forced.

A mining dam has collapsed in Brazil, causing a sea of sludge to spread to rural areas of the country's south-east state of Minas Gerais.
Up to 200 people are missing, the fire brigade says, although there have been no confirmed fatalities.
Rescue teams were dispatched and officials said a number of residents close to the dam had been evacuated. 
The dam and Feijão iron ore mine are owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale.
Vale and local authorities said on Friday that leaked tailings from the Corrego de Feijão mine had spread into the nearby community Vila Forteco, close to Brumadinho. 
Footage broadcast on local television showed the mudflow sweeping over roads and destroying buildings in its path.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Los Angeles PD Image caption Burned out areas from wildfires are more susceptible to flooding and mudflow At least two people are dead amid mudslides in Southern California, where heavy rains triggered flooding and massive run-off, US media report. ""Waist-deep"" mudslides in areas scorched by wildfires last month shut down more than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal highway, officials say. Emergency crews are working to rescue multiple people trapped in vehicles and homes, a Santa Barbara official said. At least eight people were injured and thousands have fled ahead of the rain. Heavy rain run-off caused waist-deep mudflow in the Montecito, where some homes were knocked from their foundations, Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason told the Los Angeles Times newspaper. Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kelly Huber told the newspaper two people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito and may have been killed as result of the storm. Wildfires in December, including the Thomas Fire, swept through the area burning vegetation that helps prevent flooding and landslides. Thousands of California residents were asked to evacuate on Monday for the second time in two months. Homeowners in the area shared photos of mud in their homes. Several roads are closed due to mudslides and debris, including the major thoroughfare Highway 101. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption and leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shared a warning for California homeowners explaining that homes that had never flooded before were now at risk. About 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders on Monday. This comes after a record-setting year of $306 billion (£226 billion) of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the United States, the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The storm over California is expected to produce 4 inches to 7 inches (10 to 18 cm) in the foothills and 9 inches (23 cm) in select areas. Snow is forecast for higher elevations, according to the National Weather Service.",Heavy rains triggered massive mud flows as emergency crews worked to rescue people from their homes.,2018-01-09T17:33:55Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Two dead amid California heavy rains and mudslides,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42624408,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/120EA/production/_99526937_carinmud.png,bbc-news,BBC News,rescue,1

The camaraderie, I would say, is the most familiar thing, said Travis Wilkerson, a former Marine who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and now serves on a helicopter crew with the Forest Service.

Aimée Lutkin,"Hurricane Florence has hit the North Carolina coast, already causing massive flooding in inland towns along rivers. Meteorologists are anticipating that Florence will linger and move further inland over the weekend, which means a lot of people are going to need rescue and relief. Here’s how you can help. Local Organizations Though it’s quite easy to donate to the American Red Cross via text, and they’re incredibly well-known across the country, they’re also an organization that’s been plagued with accusations of mismanagement and other mistakes. In general, it’s often best to contribute to local groups who have a better idea of what’s needed and a smaller internal infrastructure sucking up money. For the purposes of this article, we’re focusing on those. The North Carolina Community Foundation (NCCF) is a “highly-rated charity currently providing aid to the Carolinas ahead of Florence” according to ABC News, and it partners with local charities, so you know your money is being directed by people most familiar with the area. Here’s their website for donations. There are also South Carolina and Georgia state chapters of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster who each offer recommendations of which relief organizations they would choose, if you want to investigate where your money is headed. Finally, there’s The North Carolina Disaster Fund, which purports to assist with “unmet needs in the aftermath of a disaster.” These are the groups that will be in the Carolinas helping people get back on their feet long after the waters recede. Team Rubicon Team Rubicon is a group of military veterans who mobilize for rescue efforts in disasters. According to their website, they have 9,979 volunteers across VA, NC, SC, and GA and have already positioned equipment and boats along the coast to sweep in where they’re needed. Americares Americares focuses on health in disaster relief, and they currently have a response team ready for North Carolina: “The storm is on track to make a direct hit on the East Coast and impact much of the southern United States in the coming days,” Americares Director of Emergency Response Brian Scheel said in a statement Monday. “Our response team has been activated and is ready to meet the immediate health needs in affected communities.” Donations to Americares are directed to emergency medicine and other health supplies, and you can contribute here. GlobalGiving GlobalGiving supports local and grassroots groups working to restore areas hit by disasters, and they’ve already started their Hurricane Florence relief fund. Some of that money will be directed towards immediate needs, but much of it will go towards long term projects restoring the community once the storm has passed. Things are… not great now. Hurricane season is clobbering the Caribbean, earthquakes are plaguing… Read more Read American Humane and the Charleston Animal Society Don’t forget our furry friends. Vulnerable animals will need to be rescued from homes where they are abandoned and shelter animals will also be in need. National nonprofit organization American Human and the Charleston Animal Society are already helping move cats and bunnies around and above the water line in Virginia and the Carolinas. Finally, if you happen to be within range now or in the next few weeks (or possibly months), you can volunteer.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Dick Swanson Dick Swanson first went to Vietnam as a war photographer. James Jeffrey tells the story of Swanson's return - on a rescue mission for his 12 Vietnamese family members. When American photojournalist Dick Swanson first set eyes on local reporter Germaine Loc in Saigon in 1966, he thought she was beautiful, but she seemed aloof, too busy for a relationship. She thought he looked like a scruffy hippie. Despite that shaky start, they got to know each other better during the 1968 Tet Offensive, when the People's Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong launched multiple attacks catching South Vietnamese cities by surprise. ""We worked well together, almost as equals,"" Swanson says. ""After seeing me work in the field she seemed to respect me. What had it taken to impress a woman like this, to whom fighting was as normal as going to the office?"" Image copyright Swanson Photographic Archive, UT Austin Image caption A photograph by Dick Swanson of a squad of men on a patrol in Vietnam in 1969 They married in South Vietnam in 1969 before moving back to the US in 1971, so Swanson could resume his career at Life Magazine's Washington bureau. Germaine knew her family was strong - they'd fled the communists in 1954 and felt safe in Saigon. But as the war raged on, she asked her new husband, would he rescue them if South Vietnam fell? ""I said of course I would,"" Swanson remembers. By early 1975 it was clear that time was running out. On 21 April, South Vietnam's president resigned, amid reports of evacuations. It was time for the Swansons to launch their own rescue mission. On 26 April, Dick Swanson arrived on the last civilian plane landing in Saigon after a 26-hour flight via Los Angeles, Honolulu, Guam and Hong Kong. He was alone, having persuaded Germaine that it was safer if he travelled without her. ""I didn't have much of a plan,"" he says. ""But the situation was so chaotic a plan wouldn't have been much good."" He met the extended family - 12 in all - at his mother-in-law's Saigon home, as North Vietnamese mortar rounds exploded in the distance. The main hurdle was getting the family into the US air base, past security guards who were unpredictable and reluctant to admit Vietnamese. Image copyright Swanson Photographic Archive, UT Austin Image caption A photo by Dick Swanson of a deforestation mission outside the city of Ben Suc in Vietnam in 1966. Germaine's sister, Gabrielle, who was married to a colonel in the South Vietnamese air force, had the idea of calling the base to demand an official army truck pick them up the next morning during the curfew. With its military markings the vehicle would be let through, while Swanson, in order not to draw attention, travelled separately and met them at the base the next day. Dick got the chance to call Germaine to give her updates, but back in Washington, she struggled to keep busy, taking walks, cooking and watching television to distract herself. He awoke on 27 April to a city teetering on the brink. Saigon's roads were cut off by invading soldiers, the sounds of missile explosions were getting closer. Stores were being abandoned and looted. Swanson found the family at the base, but they still needed proper exit papers. He was the only one who had them. The photographer ran to the US embassy's temporary office on the base and pretended to have come to interview the man in charge for a Life Magazine article. After the ""interview"", he gingerly mentioned exit papers and how he was trying to get his entire family out. The man nodded but said he could do nothing, before pointing out the papers and the stamp, while saying he was going to the toilet. After stamping the papers, Swanson gathered the family and rushed them across the runway to US Air Force Evacuation Flight 202, headed for Guam. Image copyright Dick Swanson Image caption On the evacuation flight in 1975 But South Vietnamese army officials were checking passengers for draft-age men - like Germaine's brothers. So Germaine's mother pretended to be ill to distract them, while the brothers kept their heads down and boarded the plane. As they took off, Swanson saw thousands of South Vietnamese standing outside the fence surrounding the runway, looking for planes that weren't coming. The family was riding the last fixed-wing military plane out of the country. After arriving in California at a military base, the family faced three months of quarantine for unspecified health reasons. But Swanson said he ""raised hell in front of the world's press"", many of whom he knew, and ""they kicked us off base"". As they left, a Marine officer who spoke Vietnamese wished them prosperity and a long life in the US.

Having family already settled in the US also helped in finding work. At various points during its 20-year history, all of Germaine's family members held jobs at her renowned Washington restaurant, Germaine's, which she started after her Vietnamese cooking classes became wildly popular. Eventually the extended family spread across the US, finding love and moving to successful jobs. ""From 12 refugee members of my family, we now have an additional 14 children, who went on to have 15 children themselves, with of course more to come,"" Germaine Swanson says. Now in their eighties, the Swansons take life at a slower pace. Dick Swanson says he now considers his role as a photojournalist in the war ""neither selfish nor altruistic"". Image copyright Dick Swanson Image caption Dick Swanson, Germaine and the family having dinner at home in the US ""I grew into photojournalism in a healthy way for the most part,"" Swanson says. ""I attribute that health to early recognition of what I was doing and that I was not inflicting the pain, a process that Germaine helped me with."" Both Dick and Germaine have since returned to visit a changed Vietnam. ""Vietnam is booming,"" says Ms Swanson. ""They build resorts, villas, hotels, shopping centres that go on and on, it never stops."" Despite all the economic development, none of the 12 that fled returned to live there.

DAVID MARGOLICK,"“I was not going to leave him down there for the Chinese,” he later said. For what followed — he crash-landed his own plane, then tried unsuccessfully to pry his dying squadron mate out from under his battered fuselage in subzero temperatures while Chinese troops hovered — Lieutenant Hudner collected the first Medal of Honor awarded during the Korean War. But his feat was not purely a military one. It doubled as a civil-rights milestone: Ensign Brown was the Navy’s first black aviator, and in going to rescue him, Lieutenant Hudner, who died on Monday at 93, defied the expectations of some and defeated a different sort of foe. Photo President Harry S. Truman presenting Lieutenant Hudner with the Medal of Honor in 1951. Credit Associated Press When President Harry S. Truman integrated the armed forces two and a half years earlier, some expressed doubts that white and black soldiers would stand by one another in the heat of battle. But Ensign Brown’s race was immaterial to Lieutenant Hudner, and that was precisely the point. “A lesson in the brotherhood of man,” a leading black weekly, The Norfolk Journal and Guide, wrote. One letter among many by black admirers said of Lieutenant Hudner — who had had no black classmates at the Naval Academy — “I never thought a white man would help out a black man like that.” Only later, after he had returned home, did Lieutenant Hudner learn that what he did that day in Korea could have gotten him court-martialed. “The fact that it happened was not met with great joy by a lot of people,” he recalled in a 2013 interview with the filmmaker Charles Stuart. “Apparently our squadron captain, commander, said, ‘Now if anybody goes down, I don’t want to have any heroes here trying to crash-land this airplane.’ The very thing that I did later on, I didn’t know that was a direct violation of orders.” Mr. Hudner’s death, at his home in Concord, Mass., was announced by the Massachusetts Department of Veterans Services. Thomas Jerome Hudner Jr. was born on Aug. 31, 1924, in Fall River, Mass. His family owned a chain of meat and grocery stores. After graduating from Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., he was appointed to the Naval Academy in 1943 by Representative Joseph W. Martin Jr., then the House minority leader. He graduated in 1946 and earned his wings in 1949. Ensign Brown, of Hattisberg, Miss., came up through the naval aviation cadet program, overcoming racial bias along the way, and had earned his wings the year before. Assigned to the same 15-man squadron, the two first met in the fall of 1949 while changing into their flight gear in a locker room at the naval air station at Quonset Point, R.I. As Mr. Hudner recalled it, Ensign Brown did not extend his hand for fear of embarrassing him if he did not want to shake it. So Lieutenant Hudner walked across the room and extended his. Photo Ensign Jesse L. Brown in the cockpit of an F4U-4 Corsair fighter in 1950. Credit U.S. Navy War broke out in Korea in June 1950, and that August the aircraft carrier on which their squadron, VF-32, was based, the U.S.S. Leyte, was deployed there. On Sept. 15, United Nations forces landed at Inchon, and when tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers crossed into Korea in October, the squadron’s mission suddenly changed from offense to defense — to slowing the Chinese advance and protecting the outnumbered United Nations forces on the ground. Though technically junior to Lieutenant Hudner, Ensign Brown had logged more air time, and was therefore section leader; Lieutenant Hudner was his “tail end Charlie,” flying at his rear that day, Dec. 4. On seeing that Ensign Brown was alive after his crash landing, Lieutenant Hudner tightened his harness, jettisoned all excess weight, and landed, wheels up, within 100 yards of the wreck in two feet of snow. He found Ensign Brown conscious and calm, bareheaded, his fingers frozen, unable to reach his fallen gloves and helmet. “We’ve got to figure out how to get out of here,” Ensign Brown told him. Lieutenant Hudner removed the woolen watch cap he had carried in his flight suit, placed it over Ensign Brown’s head and wrapped Ensign Brown’s hands in an extra scarf. Then he looked into the cockpit. The ensign’s right knee was crushed and jammed between the fuselage and the control panel. With only one hand available — he needed the other to hold on to the plane — Lieutenant Hudner could not extricate him. He radioed the incoming helicopter to bring an ax and a fire extinguisher. The trapped man, he later recalled, “was very stoic.” “He was motionless and slowly dying,” he said. Lieutenant Hudner packed snow around the smoking canopy to keep any flames away. But the hatchet the helicopter pilot brought just bounced off the unyielding metal, and amputation was not an option: The rescuers could not get deep enough inside the cockpit. “If anything happens, tell Daisy I love her,” Ensign Brown told Lieutenant Hudner, referring to his wife. With nightfall rapidly approaching, the helicopter had to leave. Lieutenant Hudner promised Ensign Brown that he would return soon with better equipment. “It was a baldfaced lie,” he said later; he knew he could never get back in time. By the time Lieutenant Hudner had left him, in fact, Ensign Brown might have already died. Photo Lieutenant Hudner in 1950. Credit Department of Defense Ensign Brown’s squadron mates later returned to the site, drenched the body with napalm and set it ablaze to prevent it from being desecrated. Ensign Brown posthumously received a Distinguished Flying Cross. About four months later, with Ensign Brown’s widow sobbing behind him, Lieutenant Hudner was in the Rose Garden at the White House receiving the Medal of Honor from President Truman. Two days earlier, Truman had relieved Gen. Douglas MacArthur of his command in Korea. Away from the microphones, Truman told the young lieutenant, “At this moment, I’d much rather have received this medal than be elected the president.” Lieutenant Hudner later recounted that his in-laws, whose name was also Brown, had arrived in Washington for the ceremony seeking accommodations, only to be told by a hotel that no rooms were available. When the hotel learned that these Browns were white, they were given rooms. After his return home, Lieutenant Hudner met with the track star Jesse Owens, who had overturned the white-supremacist expectations of his Nazi hosts at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin by winning four gold medals. Mr. Hudner retired from the Navy as a captain in 1973. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts later named him state commissioner of veterans affairs. For the rest of his life, Mr. Hudner told one interviewer, the medal left him “highly spoiled” and tiresomely honored, enduring endless rounds of recognition. He put up with it, he said, to honor Americans in the armed forces. In 2013, he returned to North Korea in an unsuccessful attempt to locate Ensign Brown’s remains. He is survived by his wife, the former Georgea Farmer; a son, Thomas III; a stepson, Stan Smith; two stepdaughters, Kelly Fernandez and Shannon Gustafson; a sister, Mary Hammer; a brother, Philip; 12 grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Financial magazine Forbes says Mohammed Dewji is worth $1.5bn (£980m) The family of Tanzanian billionaire Mohammed Dewji, who was kidnapped on Thursday, has offered a 1bn Tanzania shilling ($440,000; £330,000) reward for information that would lead to his rescue. Mr Dewji. reportedly Africa's youngest billionaire, was taken by masked gunmen in the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam. The police have arrested more than 20 people in connection with the abduction But both the motive for the kidnapping and his whereabouts are still unclear. Police believe that two white men were behind Mr Dewji's disappearance, reports the BBC's Athuman Mtulya from Dar es Salaam. The family hoped that the reward will help the police's investigation, spokesperson Azim Dewji told a packed press conference. ""We want to assure anyone with the information about the whereabouts of our son to come forward and we will treat their information as secret,"" he said. Kidnappings are uncommon in Tanzania, out correspondent says. Who is Mohammed Dewji? Financial magazine Forbes puts his wealth at $1.5bn (£980m), and has described him as Tanzania's only billionaire. In a 2017 report, it said Mr Dewji, 43, was Africa's youngest billionaire. Mr Dewji is also a major sponsor of one of Tanzania's biggest football teams, Simba. He promised in 2016 to donate at least half his fortune to philanthropic causes, Forbes said. Mr Dewji, locally known as Mo, is credited with turning his family business from a wholesale and retail enterprise into a pan-African conglomerate. His company, MeTL, has interests in textile manufacturing, flour milling, beverages and edible oils in at least six African states. Mr Dewji served as a ruling party MP for a decade until 2015. He told the BBC in a 2014 interview that this possibly made it easier for him to meet top politicians, but it did not give him an unfair advantage, as other businessmen also had access to them.

CHRISTINE HAUSER,"In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan signed a law in April that bars pet store operators from selling dogs and cats but allows them to host adoptions. Stores may benefit financially from the adoptions because they can lure potential customers, Mr. ONeill said.
The law in Maryland, which takes effect in 2020, has not put a damper on business at Charm City Puppies in Columbia, which has sold about 95 dogs in the past month, said Ashley Lawson, an assistant manager. She said on Wednesday that the store sold only animals from federally licensed breeders across the United States.
Today we are actually low on puppies because of the holiday season, she said, although the store was selling a Cavalier King Charles spaniel for $2,499 and a Yorkshire terrier for $1,999.
We are still looking forward to fighting it or overturning it, she said, referring to the law. It is all in the beginning stages.
Some customers do not have the option to adopt, particularly if they are looking for a certain type of dog, she said. That is why we believe they should be given a choice.
In California, the law that took effect on Tuesday was written by two State Assembly members, Patrick ODonnell and Matt Dababneh, both Democrats. The legislations fact sheet said the bill was meant to address extremely minimal federal standards, such as a requirement that says a cage may be only six inches larger than the animal it houses and may be cleaned just once a week.
There were also financial considerations, with approximately $250 million a year in taxpayer money used to house animals in local shelters, the fact sheet said.","A dog at the Chico Municipal Airport in California, where animal agencies and nonprofit groups that helped rescue lost pets from the Camp Fire tried to reunite them with their owners.

SEE ALSO: Seattle's gone to the dogs, literally, following record snowfall
The rescue team, which trains dogs to help search for lost walkers or climbers who may be trapped in snow due to avalanches or other mountain-related accidents, gave people a firsthand look at what it's like to be saved by a pup. 
And though the real-life situations are very serious, the training video is absolutely precious.
In the video the rescue border collie named Flo can be heard barking and swiftly using her paws to dig away the pile of snow. At around 10 seconds her nose peeks through an opening, and she continues her mission to widen the gap.
At around 30 seconds Flo crawls through the opening she dug and rushes to the human's side to celebrate the successful rescue. Good. Dog.
According to Flo's bio, she's ""an extremely intelligent, confident young dog with remarkable work ethic and drive,"" and has attended more than 30 ""operational call outs for missing persons.""
The rescue team also tweeted a photograph of Flo in action, alongside the question, ""Ever wondered what it would be like to be buried in snow and found by one of our happy search and rescue dogs?""
If I'm being honest, I'd have to say no! But I'm extremely glad know now.
It's not every day you get to see a rescue firsthand without having to experience any danger, so it's very cool that England's Mountain Rescue Search Dogs gave people the opportunity to see what these brave dogs do.

ALAN BLINDER and MATT STEVENS,"In Beauregard, a few miles to the south, bundled-up state troopers and sheriffs deputies manned blockades as more blue lights flashed in the distance. The temperature stood not much higher than freezing.
Sheriff Jay Jones of Lee County, speaking to CNN on Monday morning, said,We have not had anything quite like this in our area ever, that I know of.
Alex Miller, 27, was driving with two passengers from Savannah, Ga., to his home in Birmingham, Ala., on Sunday evening when they were alerted on their cellphones that tornadoes might be approaching. They stopped at a gas station in Columbus, Ga., to let one wave of the storm system pass, and continued to head north, hoping to break through the worst of the weather during the lull.
As they neared Smiths Station, Ala., they passed a gas station with a billboard toppled over. They then passed a police blockade diverting southbound traffic off the main roads. The skies darkened, the rain grew stronger all the ominous signs, Mr. Miller said.
The plan quickly pivoted from We need to drive north to We need to pull over and seek shelter immediately, he said.
Mr. Miller pulled into a gas station in Smiths Station and sheltered in a hallway in the back with about 10 other people, including children, and a dog.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Certain details about the rescue are only now coming to light After 17 days underground, all the Thai boys and their football coach have safely escaped from the Tham Luang cave complex. A team of Thai and international divers mounted a dangerous and complicated rescue to bring the boys out, and details of the bid are still emerging now. BBC correspondent Jonathan Head has answered some of the core questions about the boys, the rescue attempt, and what happens next. Why did the kids go so deep into the cave? We will not know that until we hear from them and their assistant coach, Ekkapol 'Ek"" Chantawong. On that Saturday they were scheduled to play a match, which was cancelled, according to head coach Nopparat Kanthawong. He scheduled a training session instead. The boys were keen cyclists so on the Facebook chat group through which they communicated with the parents, coach Ek suggested they cycle to the football field. There was no suggestion there that they would go on to the caves. Image copyright Facebook/ekatol Image caption A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the young footballers Saturday was the 16th birthday of Pheeraphat 'Night' Sompiengjai, and a local shop said the boys spent more than 700 baht (US$22) on food to celebrate, a large sum in this area. Coach Nop describes Ek as being very kind-hearted and devoted to the boys. He thinks the boys persuaded him to go with them into the caves. The caves are well-known in the area and had been explored by the boys before. The best guess is they went quite deep, which is easy when they are dry, got caught by rising flood water, and were forced to go even deeper. What kind of communication have the children had with their parents and why are they not being allowed to see them? The official explanation is they are weak from their ordeal and potentially vulnerable to infection. These are now very precious lives in Thailand. A massive effort has been made to get them out alive. The Thai authorities are taking no chances. Media caption The boys give victory signs as they recover in hospital Perhaps they also wanted to avoid the excitement of seeing their parents again. Thais are generally less physical than westerners. Hugging is unusual. And the parents are from poor, marginal communities, used to being told what to do by officials, and probably grateful for the lengths the government went to in rescuing them. They would not protest. They were allowed to see them through windows, and are gradually being allowed in, wearing gloves and facemasks, to stand in the same room. Will coach Ek face any disciplinary proceedings? At this stage that seems unlikely. The parents say they have forgiven him, and they are grateful for the efforts he is reported to have made to keep their spirits up in the caves, in particular through meditation, which he learned during 12 years as a monk. Coach Nop said Ek may be asked to go back to being a monk for three months, something Thais typically do as a kind of penance, or to replenish or cleanse themselves spiritually. Such a move would make a lot of sense to Thais, and he would likely be allowed to resume life as normal after that. Also Thailand typically does not have a 'blame culture', where a culprit must be found for any misadventure. There is a more fatalistic acceptance of things going wrong, less public clamour for accountability. How did they survive so long with so little food, and lose so little weight? The boys were in the caves nine days before they were found. They may have had a little food from what they bought to celebrate Night's birthday. They are passionate football players, very fit, and with the training they have had a tight-knit team. This would have helped them ration their food carefully and support each other, perhaps with songs. Media caption Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" Coach Ek taught them to meditate, say Thai navy divers, and gave them more food than he ate. He also told them to drink water dripping from the rocks, rather than polluted ground water. During their last six to eight days they were being fed, initially high-protein gels, but later more normal food, which might have allowed them to start putting on a little weight before coming out. Were they in the dark the whole time? Most of the time. They went in with cheap torches, which would not have lasted long. It is likely they were in the dark for most of the first nine days of their ordeal. Once they were found a Thai army doctor and at least three divers stayed with them, equipped with good torches. Even so they were mostly in the dark, and had to wear sunglasses when they were first brought out. Image copyright Thai Navy SEALs/Getty Images Image caption Rescuers brought them food, light and letters from their parents to help them cope Were they sedated in any way? The Thai authorities are being very coy about this. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said they had been lightly sedated. But the BBC has spoken to a number of people involved in the operation who say the boys were heavily sedated, and only semi-conscious. The logic for this would be the fear their rescuers had that they would panic when wearing diving equipment for the first time in darkness and swirling cave water, endangering the lives of all of them. The two British cave divers who led the rescue effort, John Volanthen and Richard Stanton, are believed to have asked for Australian Richard Harris, a cave diver and anaesthetician, to assist in preparing the boys. How they carried semi-conscious or very drowsy boys through the technically challenging early stages of the journey out, with a lot of diving in narrow passages, we do not know. At times they may have been strapped to a diver's body. Later they were strapped on to a stretcher and suspended from a rope pulley system attached to the cave roof. The entire operation was complex, innovative and very bold. Nothing like it has been attempted before. Some of those involved described the tasks undertaken by the core divers, who carried the boys out, as superhuman. Who has paid for this operation? The Thai government, for most of it. It is likely that the contribution by other countries, like the 30 US air force personnel who went to help, would have been funded by their own governments as a gesture of good will. Many Thai businesses supported with transport and food. Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways offered free flights to some of the foreign divers coming in. Media caption Thailand cave rescue: Meet the volunteer helpers Could the Thais have done this on their own? No, and few countries could. Cave diving is a very specialised skill, and expert cave rescuers are even rarer. Thailand was fortunate that an experienced caver Vern Unsworth has explored the Tham Luang cave complex extensively, and lives nearby. He was on the scene the day after the boys disappeared, and suggested that the Thai government needed to invite expert divers from other countries to help. The Thai navy divers who went down initially struggled, because both their experience and equipment were for sea diving, which is very different. They were driven out of the caves by rapidly rising flood water, and finding the boys seemed a hopeless cause. Once foreign divers arrived, from many different countries, the Thai authorities allowed them to devise first the search, and then the enormously complex rescue. It was a huge logistical operation involving hundreds of people, building guide rope and pulley systems, putting in power and communication cables. It is to Thailand's credit that it was organised so well, and there was no attempt to diminish the foreign contribution. Do you have a question about the Thai cave rescue?

 Emiliano Sala was returning to Cardiff after signing for the club on the weekend
The search for a missing aircraft that was carrying Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala will resume at sunrise.
The Argentine striker, 28, was one of two people on board the plane which lost contact off Alderney in the Channel Islands on Monday night.
Five aircraft and two lifeboats scoured more than 1,000 sq miles for traces of the Piper Malibu plane on Tuesday.
Sala was heading to the Welsh capital after signing for the Bluebirds from French club Nantes in a £15m deal.
Cardiff's chief executive said the club had been left in ""shock"".
Air and sea crews from the Channel Islands, France and the UK took part in a 15-hour search on Tuesday, but found no trace of the aircraft or its occupants.
Guernsey Police was not able to confirm if floating objects seen belonged to the aircraft and warned that chances of passenger survival were ""slim"".
""We have found no signs of those on board,"" the force tweeted. ""If they did land on the water, the chances of survival are at this stage, unfortunately, slim.""
Sala's father Horacio told Argentine TV channel C5N he was ""desperate"".
On Tuesday night, football fans in Nantes laid flowers at a fountain as a tribute to Sala and the plane's pilot. 
After joining in 2015, he had scored 48 goals for the Ligue 1 side.
French sports newspaper L'Equipe carried the news of Sala's plight on its front page on Wednesday with the headline: ""The disappearance of a warrior"".
It wrote: ""In Nantes, the wait has been unbearable for the supporters of a forward loved for his battling qualities.""

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The accident took place close to the cable car station on Table Mountain The bodies of a tourist and his guide have been recovered from South Africa's Table Mountain following an accident which trapped hundreds of people at the top of the popular attraction. The man, his local guide and a second tourist are reported to have been using ropes to scale the front of the Cape Town mountain when they fell on Monday. Rescuers then used the cable car to reach the surviving climber. But the bodies were not recovered until first light on Tuesday. The tourists are understood to be of Asian origin, while the guide was a South African, a spokeswoman for South Africa's Sanparks, which runs the country's national parks, told the BBC. According to local media reports, the cable car service - which takes thousands of people up and down the mountain every day - was out of action for more than five hours. About 800 people were eventually able to get down at around 22:00 local time (20:00 GMT). John Marais, of Wilderness Search and Rescue, explained to South African news site TimesLive that after their accident, the two climbers were seen ""dangling"" on ropes about 150 metres below the cable car station.

Wendy Dent,"Around 6 pm Tuesday at Tham Luang in Thailand, the last of the 13 survivors who had spent 18 days trapped in a cave emerged to safety. A rescue team had spent the past three days getting the boys out after five days of desperate planning and calculations since their discovery. As the boys’ oxygen supply dwindled, doubts in the rescuers’ ability to save them mounted. The boys weren’t trained scuba divers, and they were facing a voyage on which a pro Thai Navy SEAL died, while placing oxygen tank supplies along the route. Then Elon Musk entered the fray, apparently at the humble request of a Twitter follower: What followed was a curious few days where two rescue operations played out simultaneously. The first was the official one in Thailand that ultimately proved successful, and the second was run by Musk—an unsolicited effort that Thai authorities ultimately called “not practical for our mission” but one that captivated the internet and reinforced the most flattering image of Musk: as a brilliant engineer with a nose for unexpected solutions to pressing problems, delivered in record time. In his inimitable fashion, Musk started tossing out fresh ideas for ways to free the boys, chatting with his followers. It inspired a wealth of budding engineers to brainstorm and send hand-drawn designs his way too. ""Boring Co has advanced ground penetrating radar &amp; is pretty good at digging holes. Don’t know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too small. If so, could dropship fully charged Powerpacks and pumps."" For a mogul who has spent recent months fighting with the press and a few investors, it was a chance to put those skills and an ample bank account to use for an unambiguously great cause, with no frustrating quibbling over production rates or financial figures. So, never one to keep a single project in mind, Musk started down two paths. For the first, he tapped Wing Inflatables. The SpaceX contractor is based in Arcata, California, 350 miles north of San Francisco. “We manufacture inflatable recovery parts for SpaceX,” says CEO Andrew Branagh. “So we have a relationship. When Elon had an idea, he asked our engineering team to get a hold of us."" So they hopped on a conference call. “Elon Musk was on the call,” Branagh says. “He was very visionary. I was impressed. They were open to our ideas."" The result of the collaborative brainstorm was a red kevlar pouch of sorts, designed to carry the boys. The ""inflatable tube with airlocks,"" as Musk called it, could be pulled along, stretcher style, by a trained diver, freeing the boys from needing to learn how to dive or use scuba gear. ""They are like a bell chamber,"" Branagh says. Just as a church bell tower contains or releases sound by closing or opening a series of vents, the inflatable tube with airlocks uses air pressure to control the buoyancy, necessary for moving through a cave complex where you occasionally have to drop down to keep moving forward. When you turn parts of the pods one way, it allows them to float. ""When you turn them another way, they sink."" (To keep the boys calm during a long, claustrophobic voyage, Branagh suggested valium.) They moved fast and worked hard. ""We started with a concept at 8 am and had a prototype in the pool being tested the same day,” Branagh says. “Then the team stayed until 1 in the morning and built more units.” Enough units to get all 12 boys, plus their coach, out of the cave and into the daylight. The following afternoon, Musk’s jet touched down in Arcata to pick up the potential life savers. “A third of the factory went to the plane to wish it luck,” Branagh says. The pouches that went into the jet, however, never appeared in the public light, and it’s not clear where they ended up. Musk never mentioned them on Twitter. While Branagh and his team were racing to put them together, Musk was hedging his bets with another design approach. Made from an oxygen tube designed for a SpaceX Falcon rocket, the bullet-shaped capsule followed the same principle as the pouch the Wing team devised, an air pressure–controlled vehicle of sorts for the boys to lay inside while the pro divers guided them to safety. Musk called it a ""kid-sized submarine” and said it was 12.2 inches in diameter, skinny enough to fit through the narrowest “choke hold” of the passage. He called it Wild Boar, in honor of the boys’ soccer team. ""Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments,"" he tweeted, ""particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at [standard] air pressure entire time."" And because Musk is always thinking on a few tracks at once, he noted, “with some mods this could also work as an escape pod in space."" As the engineering process sped along, Musk updated the public with a steady stream of tweets. The aluminum capsules could use a thin layer of neoprene insulation, he said, and their buoyancy would be controlled by strapping diving weight belts around them. Musk also considered one follower’s suggestion to add a music player to the setup. ""Yeah, that sounds cool,” he replied. “Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player."" But by the time Musk’s team had tested its design in a Los Angeles pool, on Saturday, the rescue operation was already underway in Thailand, and Musk’s help wasn’t needed. “Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future."" Still, Musk put the design on his plane and made the trip over the Pacific. When he arrived, it was day three of the rescue. Eight boys were already out safe, thanks to the low-tech diving method, and the remaining four boys and their coach would soon be free. He dropped off the mini-sub in one of the caves in the long complex. ""Leaving this here in case it may be useful,” he tweeted. “Thailand is so beautiful.” It’s unclear whether the design could have been helpful had it arrived earlier, and whether the hastily assembled capsule would have met the demands of the diving and medical experts on the scene. Representatives for SpaceX and Musk declined to answer questions about various details of the process, including the team’s communications with local authorities. Whatever the answers, Musk was eager to play a role in the rescue. And for that, he faced accusations that he inserted himself in the situation to promote himself. “Musk has a long track record of promising to solve huge problems and then either missing deadlines or falling short,” Adam Clark Estes wrote in Gizmodo. “Along the way, he’s also built up a cult of personality that leads fans to compare him to comic book superheroes. So even if Musk isn’t really serious about his ridiculous, buzz-building projects, plenty of people still think he is.” Musk again took to Twitter to parry the critique: “This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.” By Wednesday afternoon, he’d moved on to a new problem that needs fixing. “Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels,” he tweeted. “No kidding.” More Great WIRED Stories","The SpaceX and Tesla CEO's work to help the rescue operation captivated the internet and reinforced the most flattering image of Musk, as a brilliant engineer with a nose for unexpected solutions to pressing problems.",2018-07-11T22:20:31Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",The Engineering Behind Elon Musk's Bid to Save Thailand's Cave Boys,https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-thailand-cave-boys-rescue-engineering/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b452bc49bc3f356f4059475/191:100/pass/Cave_AP_18176408805848.jpg,wired,Wired,rescue,1

Jon Fingas,"The drones are more efficient in how they search, too. Rather than simply telling the drones to cover the nearest unexplored area, MIT's method preserves as much of the drone's momentum as possible. This typically results in a spiral pattern that covers an area much faster -- important in a rescue mission when every minute counts. There are limitations. The current system still needs an external ground station to merge maps, and it would need an object recognition system to identify people. MIT envisions future versions sharing maps when they come in contact, though, and object recognition is entirely realistic. If everything falls into place, the appeal will be obvious. Rescue teams could spot lost and wounded hikers in the woods without relying on large groups of people, and likely at a much faster pace.","Drones can already be effective search and rescue tools, but not in densely-packed forests where the tree cover might block GPS signals.

Kate Clark,"There are few things more irritating than a canceled flight, whether it’s on your way to a friend’s wedding, a conference or to celebrate a holiday back home. Wouldn’t it be nifty if technology could put an end to our travel woes? Freebird, a travel rebooking service, has raised an $8 million Series A to do just that. The startup charges a minimum of $19 per flight — more depending on distance, time of year, location and more — to independent travelers and companies that partner with the service to help travelers rebook flights after cancellations or other “disruption events.” Most of the time, flights are on-time and without issue, which means that most of the time, Freebird pockets all of its customer’s cash. But if there is a disruption event, Freebird guarantees it will rebook you with just three taps of your phone and without any additional charge. American Express Ventures has led the round, with support from Citi Ventures, PAR Capital Ventures, General Catalyst and Accomplice. Freebird is currently in discussions with Amex and Citi, as well as other banks, to roll its travel benefits into their corporate card services. To date, the startup works with 100 corporate clients and 10 corporate travel agency partners, including BCD Travel. Freebird says it expects to support 250,000 travelers this year. Founded in 2015 by Ethan Bernstein, Cambridge, Mass.-based Freebird aggregates data on flight patterns to predict the probability of a flight disruption. If the probability is high, Freebird chargers more for access to its mobile rebooking tool. “If you’re flying out of Buffalo in the winter, it’s going to be a higher risk flight,” Freebird chief executive officer Bernstein told TechCrunch. “If you’re flying out of Phoenix in the summer, you’re at a very low risk of being disrupted. We understand those risks and we are able to price our product differently based on those factors.” Freebird has raised a total of $16.5 million in funding to date. It’s one of many travel technology startups to bring in venture capital this year. IfOnly, a marketplace for experiences, secured $20 million in April; luggage startup Away brought in a $50 million in June; and travel activities platform Klook raised $200 million in August, to name a few. Freebird, though focused specifically on flights, says its experiences are at the forefront of its business model. “There are a million different products that will help you automate your life but one of the things we are focused on is transforming personal experiences,” Bernstein said. “Do they go through these disruption events tearing their hair out or do they go through it knowing that they have control, agency, support and information? It’s funny what happens when people deal with uncertainty; uncertainty is the worst. As soon you give people information, human support and technology to help them solve their problems, they experience the event so much differently.”","American Express Ventures has led the round, with support from Citi Ventures, PAR Capital Ventures, General Catalyst and Accomplice.",2018-10-30T16:02:42Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Freebird flies off with $8M to rescue passengers after flight cancellations,http://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/freebird-flies-off-with-8m-to-rescue-passengers-after-flight-cancellations/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-896973272.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,rescue,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Twitter/@corpoelectachir Power cuts are frequent in Venezuela. The eastern state of Táchira is one of the worst hit with residents complaining that they often spend up to eight hours without power. The state-run power corporation Corpoelec rarely gives reasons for the cuts, while the government has in the past blamed ""saboteurs"". But on Sunday, Corpoelec was quick to say it would have to turn off the power - to free a paraglider who had become tangled in its power lines. Energy Minister Luis Motta Dominguez said the man had become caught in a guy wire which does not carry any electricity. He posted a photo on Instagram pointing out the two wires which had to be disconnected in order to disentangle the paraglider. Mr Motta Dominguez later gave an update to say the man had been rescued. It is not clear if he suffered any injuries. The minister said the power cut had affected 360 voting centres in the state where Venezuelans were casting their ballots in municipal elections on Sunday. With mainstream opposition parties boycotting the vote, turnout was very low with just 27% casting a ballot. In 2013, participation in municipal elections was above 58%. With many of those critical of the government staying away, the governing socialist PSUV party won almost all the seats up for grabs, according to electoral official Tibisay Lucena.

However Musk’s unasked for experimental ‘escape pod’ device has not been involved in the rescue mission — after being deemed impractical for conditions in the caves.

 Russian rescuers have gone to the scene (file pic of coastguard boat)
Two Tanzania-flagged cargo vessels are ablaze in the Black Sea near the Kerch Strait, and Russian rescuers are trying to reach sailors who jumped overboard.
So far three have been rescued and one dead body has been recovered, Russia's maritime agency Rosmorrechflot says. 
One ship is a gas tanker, and the fire reportedly followed an explosion, which set the other vessel on fire.
They were named as the Kandy, with a crew of 17 from Turkey and India, and Maestro, with 14 sailors.
The Kerch Strait is a focus of tension between Russia and Ukraine. 
In November Russian border guards seized three Ukrainian naval vessels near the narrow channel, which links the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov. 
A court in Russia has extended by three months the detention of 24 Ukrainian sailors captured in the incident. They are accused of illegally crossing into Russian territory.
Ukraine condemned the Russian move, denying that its ships had violated the navigation laws in the area.

JEREMY W. PETERS and ELIZABETH DIAS,"But Christian conservatives contend that Mr. Trump has also more than honored his end of the bargain that brought reluctant members of their ranks along during his presidential campaign. He has begun the process of moving the American E mbassy in Israel to Jerusalem, won the confirmation of numerous judges and a Supreme Court Justice who seem likely to advance their anti-abortion cause, moved against transgender protections throughout the government, increased the ability of churches to organize politically and personally supported the March for Life. “I don’t know of anyone who has worked the evangelical community more effectively than Donald Trump,” said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which this year plans to devote four times the money it spent in the 2014 midterms. In essence, many evangelical leaders have decided that airing moral qualms about the president only hurts their cause. “His family can talk to him about issues of character,” said Penny Young Nance, the president of Concerned Women for America, an evangelical organization that is framing the midterm elections to potential donors as a civilizational struggle. So far, the decision by most conservative evangelical leaders to double down on their support for Mr. Trump is playing out like most of the other moments when skeptics of the president believed he had finally undermined himself with his base. A poll released last week by the Public Religion Research Institute found white evangelical approval for Mr. Trump at its highest level ever: 75 percent. Only 22 percent said they had an unfavorable view of the president. Much as in the 2016 presidential campaign, Christian conservative events are designed to be highly visible and to convey the movement as one united voice. Hundreds of evangelical leaders plan to gather in June at the Trump International Hotel in Washington for a conspicuous show of support for Mr. Trump. The event will be part pep rally, part strategy session. Photo Penny Young Nance, center, is president of Concerned Women for America, an evangelical organization that is framing the midterm elections to potential donors as a civilizational struggle. Credit Evan Vucci/Associated Press Paula White, a pastor for Mr. Trump for more than 16 years, has facilitated events for conservative evangelicals to meet senior White House officials, including a gathering for women and another for pastors of megachurches in recent weeks. “Let’s pray there’s not apathy,” Ms. White said. In the states, leading religious and socially conservative groups will be propped up by the Republican National Committee, which will encourage voter registration at churches and schedule round tables with local pastors and evangelical liaisons close to the president. Some of the organizers call themselves “the watchmen on the wall,” a reference to guards who looked over Jerusalem from the Book of Isaiah. The message to energize Christian conservatives has twin purposes: to inspire them to celebrate their victories and to stoke enough grievance to prod them to vote. But in a midterm election, no singular political enemy will emerge the way Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Instead, leaders of the movement plan to lean hard into a message that fans fears and grudges: that the progressive movement and national media mock Christian life and threaten everything religious conservatives have achieved in the 15 months of the Trump administration. “Show the left that you can put labels on us, you can shame us. But we’re not giving up,” said Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, who explained that many conservatives of faith see attacks on Mr. Trump as an attack on their judgment. The Family Research Council has already activated its network of 15,000 churches, half of which have “ culture impact ministries ” that organize congregations to be more socially and civically engaged. The group’s efforts will gear up with voter registration drives around the Fourth of July and voter education that will focus on a half-dozen states that could determine control of the Senate. Their tactics are almost identical to the work they used during the presidential campaign to unite a fractured evangelical base. The June meeting in Washington is a follow-up to a gathering in New York in the summer of 2016 that soothed tensions after it became apparent that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee. Leaders of the Christian right have not only largely accepted Mr. Trump’s flaws and moved on; they seem to almost dare the president’s opponents to throw more at him. Ms. Nance said she heard a common sentiment from volunteers and supporters who did not seem bothered by the allegations of Mr. Trump’s infidelity. “We weren’t looking for a husband,” she said. “We were looking for a body guard.” Concerned Women for America’s fund-raising pitch claims, “This is our Esther moment,” referring to the biblical heroine whose resourcefulness saved Persia’s Jews from annihilation hundreds of years before Jesus. The group plans to have get-out-the-vote organizers in 10 states where Democrats are defending Senate seats in states where Mr. Trump won. Mike Mears, the Republican National Committee’s director of strategic partnerships and faith engagement, described the midterm campaign as “a call to arms.” “You like what the president is doing?” he asked. “We need your help.” The danger for Republicans is the many evangelicals who do not like what the president is doing. His petty insults, coarse language, lack of humility and private life are difficult to square with Christian faith, opponents say. The president has helped devalue character, morality and fidelity as essential qualities in political leaders, they say. A meeting of evangelical leaders in Illinois last week featured a frank and candid discussion of the president’s failings, prompting some pro-Trump attendees to walk out. But for evangelicals loyal to Mr. Trump, the criticism is irrelevant. They say that as challenging as the political realities may be, they remain hopeful that voters understand what is at stake. “We are living in unusual times,” said Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University and one of Mr. Trump’s earliest evangelical supporters. “And after what happened in 2016, I think anything is possible.” Continue reading the main story","In what has been described as its largest midterm mobilization ever, the Christian conservative movement is looking past the president’s behavior and toward November.",2018-04-24T17:48:12Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Shrugging Off Trump Scandals, Evangelicals Look to Rescue G.O.P.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/politics/trump-evangelicals-midterm-elections.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/25/us/politics/25dc-evangelicals1/25dc-evangelicals1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,rescue,1
Gizmodo Staff,"Citing government sources, Variety reported on Friday that a staggering six different companies are now developing films about the recent rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a cave in Thailand. That means as many as six different actors will play real-life irony man Elon Musk, who, while perhaps not instrumental to the rescue, was certainly also there. Even for Hollywood’s most inventive casting directors, recruiting that many Elons poses a serious challenge. Fortunately for them, we have some suggestions. 1. Jesse Plemons “If you squint just right, Jesse Plemons looks a little bit like Elon. Plus, the guy’s got chops. Between his appearances on Friday Night Lights, Breaking Bad, and Fargo, we know he can pull off, good, evil, and everything in between.”—Rhett Jones 2. Rob McElhenney “Not only has Musk previously demonstrated that he sees himself as the ‘ brains of the operation,’ he also has a tendency to consolidate mass from time to time. These are two trademark traits of the character Mac played by Rob McElhenney on the hit series It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.”—Adam Clark Estes 3. Chappie from the movie Chappie “ Chappie is the story of a very expensive baby learning how to behave in public.”—Bryan Menegus 4. Jimmi Simpson “Originally, my pick to play Elon was Ninja from Die Antwoord, but in light of Bryan’s insightful Chappie suggestion, I’m changing my answer to Jimmi Simpson. In Westworld, Simpson plays William, who gets seduced by a host played by Talulah Riley (Musk’s ex-wife) before deciding to kill all the robots, which pretty much sums up Elon’s stance on AI. Jimmi’s got this role in the bag.”—Sam Rutherford 5. Jude Law “Jude Law, like Elon Musk, is a man of reinvention—and not just with his hairline. He’s gone from roguish young lead, to weirdo in bad CGI movies, to swollen (if youngish-looking) lead again.”—Alex Cranz 6. Scarlett Johansson “I can’t think of anyone better suited to tell this important story.”—Hudson Hongo","Citing government sources, Variety reported on Friday that a staggering six different companies are now developing films about the recent rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a cave in Thailand.

Samantha Nelson,"Spoilers for the general plot of Nightflyers ahead. In the first episode of Syfy’s new series Nightflyers, Karl D’Branin (Eoin Macken), head of a scientific expedition meant to intercept an alien spaceship and establish first contact, talks with xenobiologist Rowan (Angus Sampson) about the mission. Karl views the incredible energy given off by the ship as mankind’s salvation, but Rowan expects the aliens haven’t responded to repeated messages from Earth because they don’t want to talk. “Any beings that intelligent would see the human race for what we are,” he says. “We’re a virus that has killed its host and is looking for a new host to infect… They’re probably going to exterminate us.” Science fiction typically portrays aliens either as evil forces looking to conquer Earth or as benevolent beings helping humans along the path to enlightenment. Nightflyers stands apart because it asks which form of extraterrestrial contact humanity deserves. Loosely based on George R.R. Martin’s 40-year-old novella of the same name, Nightflyers is set in 2093, as humanity looks to colonize the stars to escape their plague-ravaged home. D’Branin has persuaded the mysterious Captain Roy Eris (David Ajala) to take a handpicked crew of scientists and specialists on board the Nightflyer to ask the aliens — known as the volcryn — for help. Things immediately start going wrong when the Nightflyer experiences a series of mysterious mechanical problems that Eris cryptically promises to get under control. Making matters worse is the presence of the powerful psychic Thale (Sam Strike), whom Karl believes is key to communicating with the volcryn. Wonderfully played as an abrasive Cockney teen testing the limits of everyone around him, Thale is both a gadfly and a scapegoat for the ship, and he makes characters and viewers alike question whether what they’re seeing is real or just his mind games. Some vaguely referenced incident has led all psychics to be taken from their parents and imprisoned as soon as their powers manifest, and the crew’s treatment of Thale threatens their ability to make contact, but it also provides further fodder for Rowan’s pessimistic expectations. Showrunner Jeff Buhler has built a fascinating world around Martin’s story seeds, starting by setting the action within the foreseeable future, rather than in an incomprehensibly distant one. The invented technologies here are particularly intriguing, like the genetic modifications first officer Melantha Jhirl (Jodie Turner-Smith) has to make her better suited for space travel, or the cybernetics technician Lommie (Maya Eshet) uses to interface with machinery. Given the state of real-world technological developments in genetic engineering and research into brain-machine interfaces, the series feels plausible and grounded, even though it’s set in a spacefaring future. While most of the show’s action takes place on board the Nightflyer, extra exposition occasionally comes through flashbacks, which are enabled by a sphere that feels like a fusion of Star Trek ’s holodeck and the memory-playback technology used in the Black Mirror episode “The Entire History of You.” It’s a novel idea, though it becomes questionable how many times crewmembers choose to play back terrible memories, particularly once the sadistic intelligence in control of the ship starts using their data against them. Memory is a major theme in Nightflyers, with Karl agonizing about his wife’s decision to undergo a therapy straight out of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to help her move past their daughter’s death, while Roy is haunted by thoughts about his brilliant mother who designed the Nightflyer. Photo: Jonathan Hession / Syfy Nightflyers breaks up the space-horror tension with good old-fashioned soap opera fare. Stressed, far from home, and presented with limited romantic options, the crew members quickly form a tangled web of relationships. Lommie hooks up with Melantha, who wants to keep it casual because she’s also got a thing for the captain, who creepily watches her through the ship’s cameras. Thale is infatuated with his psychologist, Dr. Agatha Matheson (Gretchen Mol) whose romantic past with Karl soured due to her work with psychics. Rowan flirts with the ship’s biologist while they analyze blood samples. It’s all pretty silly and hard to take seriously, but it helps build investment in the characters, to keep audiences interested in the outcome of the crisis du jour. It’s easy to draw comparisons between Nightflyers and Hulu’s recently debuted Origin since both are about the crews of troubled spaceships. Nightflyers is the better model, relying less on gore and jump-scares, and instead producing slow-burning psychological suspense. But it’s far from perfect, and the novelty of its premise and world is weighed down by an over-reliance on familiar tropes like killer robots, malevolent AI, and haunted houses. Photo: Jonathan Hession / Syfy The show’s biggest weakness might be its refusal to end plots, a common trap for mystery-driven genre shows. Nightflyers ’ opening scene lets viewers know that the story won’t end well for at least some of the crew members, and the show is built around exploring how they get to that point. Even in the first five episodes provided for review, some of that material feels like filler. It’s understandable that the writers don’t want to deliver answers, which are so often less satisfying than questions. Roy immediately becomes a much less sympathetic character as soon as he lets the crew in on his big secret. The scenes they spend trying to deal with that information are some of the show’s worst, and just when it looks like they might be able to move on, Buhler uses yet another tired horror trope to make it clear that nothing is really resolved. Plenty of other little mysteries are introduced and left hanging, not the least of which is why the aliens are referred to as volcryn. In Martin’s novella, the word comes from a myth humans learn from other aliens, but there’s no explanation for it here. That’s especially irritating since the wide variety of accents among the actors makes it hard to tell what the name actually is. Like humanity, Nightflyers is grappling with some serious problems. But both also have the potential to learn from their mistakes and do something extraordinary. The crew of the Nightflyer needs to make their case for survival to a powerful alien race. Nightflyers is facing a similar existential crisis. To survive, it has to earn the attention and love of streaming viewers in a crowded science fiction field, and they may be even more difficult to comprehend. All 10 episodes of Nightflyers will air on Syfy on Dec. 2nd through 13th at 10PM ET.","The 10-episode space series on Syfy adapts a 40-year-old novella by the Game of Thrones author.

Tom McKay,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk accused one of the British divers involved in the rescue of 12 Thai boys and their soccer coach from the flooded Tham Luang cave complex of being a pedophile on Saturday in retaliation for questioning Musk’s contributions to the rescue effort. Yeah. CNN reported that the diver in question, Chiang Rai resident Vern Unsworth, played a critical role in not only finding the 13 members of the trapped soccer team but spent 17 days in the complex helping extract them alongside other specialist cave divers. Unsworth told CNN in an interview that the custom-made “submarine”—really more of an air-filled tube—Musk personally delivered to the cave complex was worthless and could play no role in a rescue attempt. (Thai authorities had already called the device “not practical with our mission.”) “He can stick his submarine where it hurts,” Unsworth said. “It just had absolutely no chance of working. He had no conception of what the cave passage was like. The submarine, I believe, was about five-foot-six long, rigid, so it wouldn’t have gone round corners or round any obstacles.” “It wouldn’t have made it the first 50 meters into the cave from the dive start point,” Unsworth concluded. “Just a PR stunt... He was asked to leave very quickly, and so he should have been.” In a series of tweets responding to Unsworth’s criticism, Musk referred to Unsworth’s “British expat guy who lives in Thailand” as “sus” (suspicious) and said he had never seen him at the cave complex. Musk challenged Unsworth’s accounting of the water levels in the cave, then got even angrier, explicitly calling Unsworth a “pedo guy” and saying he would prove the device’s utility by, uh, sending more people into the cave with it. Musk further questioned the allegation of a PR stunt, saying he had repeatedly declined to help until the death of former Royal Thai Navy special operations diver Saman Gunan in the cave. Then he doubled down again on his accusation that Unsworth is a pedophile, replying to another Twitter user, “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true.” The billionaire CEO’s behavior has been erratic for a while now, from mass-emailing staff to be “extremely vigilant” amid the possibility of “sabotage” at Tesla’s Fresno, California production plant, to that time he cited a blog run by an alleged sex cult as an example of “excellent” journalism. That said, accusing the diver that found 13 people trapped in a cave and worked to save them for over two weeks of being a pedophile—just for having the temerity to criticize his unused submarine—could be safely called a new low. Some advice for Elon that doesn’t cost as much as a defamation suit: Log off, do not pass go, and do not send any more people back into that cave to prove your point. “Just to get any of them out alive would have been a miracle,” Unsworth told CNN. “But to get 13 out of 13... won’t happen again... biggest miracle ever.” Gizmodo has reached out to Tesla and SpaceX for comment, and we’ll update this post if we hear back.",Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk accused one of the British divers involved in the rescue of 12 Thai boys and their soccer coach from the flooded Tham Luang cave complex of being a pedophile on Saturday in retaliation for questioning Musk’s contributions to the…,2018-07-15T17:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Increasingly Agitated Elon Musk Labels Diver Who Mocked His 'Submarine' a 'Pedo Guy',https://gizmodo.com/increasingly-agitated-elon-musk-labels-diver-who-mocked-1827611345,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--q8SmYf6s--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/afambpmumrodpafttxxh.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,rescue,1

Media captionRescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide
At least 34 people have been killed and about 300 others remain missing after a dam collapsed at an iron ore mine in south-eastern Brazil, officials say.
Rescue teams are scouring the site near the town of Brumadinho, in Minas Gerais state, following Friday's collapse. 
It is not clear what caused the failure of the dam, owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale.
The company has had 5bn reais ($1.33bn; £1bn) frozen from its accounts to help fund recovery works and handle damages.
The rupture of the dam caused a sea of muddy sludge to bury the site's cafeteria, where workers were eating lunch on Friday. 
On Saturday, emergency services used helicopters and earth-moving machinery in the search for survivors. 
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Relatives of those who remain missing await news of their loved ones
Some 50 people were rescued from the sludge and 23 people were taken to hospital, but Minas Gerais state governor Romeu Zema said the chances of finding more survivors were slim.
""We're likely to just be recovering bodies,"" he said, adding that ""those involved in this tragedy should be punished"". 
Relatives of the missing have been demanding information on their loved ones. 
""My five-year-old nephew is asking me if his dad died. What do I tell him?"" asked Olivia Rios.
President Jair Bolsonaro, who flew over the disaster area in a helicopter on Saturday, tweeted that it was hard not to get ""emotional"" after seeing the scale of the devastation.
Image copyrightEPAImage caption
 President Jair Bolsonaro said all efforts were being made to rescue survivors
He said he had accepted an offer by Israel to send search equipment that could find people buried in the mud.
Also on Saturday, Brazil's Environmental Protection Agency (Ibama) issued Vale with an initial fine of 250m reais ($66.5m; £50m) in relation to the incident.
Authorities co-ordinating the rescue effort urged volunteers to stay away because of the dangerous conditions, while media organisations were asked not to use drones in order to avoid collisions with helicopters.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Hopes of finding more survivors are getting slimmer
The collapse comes just over three years since a dam burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais, killing 19 people, in what was considered Brazil's worst environmental disaster.
What do we know about the collapse?
The dam near Feijão iron ore mine burst its barrier at around 13:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Friday, flooding another dam down below.
The torrent of sludge cut through the dam's complex, nearby farms and the neighbourhood where many of the workers live, destroying houses and vehicles.
There are reports that the dam's alarm system - which local residents had been trained to respond to - failed at the time of the accident. 
But Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the accident may have occurred too quickly for a siren which triggers security protocols to be activated.
The Globo website later reported that rescue officials provided the following breakdown on the number of the missing:
At least 100 people in the administrative area close to the burst dam
About 30 people in the Vila Vértico area
About 35 people at Nova Estancia Inn
At least 100 people in the Parque das Cachoeiras
Dozens of trapped people, many of them covered in mud, had to be evacuated by helicopter as roads were destroyed.
Many other residents have been evacuated as a safety measure.
""I'm anxious, I want news,"" 28-year-old Helton Pereira told the BBC as he waited outside a hospital in nearby Belo Horizonte - his 28-year-old wife and 35-year-old sister worked at the dam's cafeteria and were both missing.
""From now, the odds are minimal and it's most likely we'll recover only bodies,"" Governor Zema said.
Image copyrightEPAImage caption
 The sea of muddy sludge swept over roads and destroyed buildings
Built in 1976, the dam was one of several in the area and it was used to hold residue from the mine. 
It had a capacity of 12m cubic metres and had been an inactive site for three years, Vale said.
What happened in 2015?
On 5 November 2015, a dam - also owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton - burst at a Samarco mine in Mariana.
More than 60m cubic metres - enough to fill 20,000 Olympic swimming pools - spilled over into the surrounding area.
After a lengthy court case, BHP Billiton and Vale reached a settlement worth at least 6.8bn reais with the Brazilian government.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Mr Gassama was given residency on Tuesday, a first step towards citizenship If you come to France without the right papers and you want to get French citizenship, then it's really quite simple. As the case of Mamoudou Gassama goes to show, all you have to do is pull off something ""exceptional"". Actually that is not being flippant. It is in the civil code. Article 21-19 says that a fast-track naturalisation procedure is possible for a foreign national who has ""performed exceptional services for France, or whose naturalisation would be of exceptional interest for France"". This is what President Emmanuel Macron was invoking when he congratulated the young Malian at the Elysée palace and told him his papers would be in the post. Being a nation founded on a set of self-declared values, France has always been open to the idea of an ""honorary"" French citizenship - a way of elevating worthy foreigners whose actions have defended or propagated those values. Back in the early days of the Revolution, there was a law that gave citizenship to those ""who by their writings and their courage have served the cause of freedom"". Beneficiaries included George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption About 200 French foreign legionnaires get citizenship each year Much later, in 1870, a decree offered citizenship to people who had fought alongside France in the war against Germany. Most of those who benefited at the time were actually Germans. And of course there is also the special case of the Foreign Legion, which since the 1830s has offered a chance to fight for France to soldiers of other nations. Contrary to popular belief, Foreign Legion soldiers do not get automatic French citizenship, except if they are wounded in action. Today - with the legion employing 8,600 soldiers from 150 countries - there are about 200 naturalisations a year. But all these precedents were set in the days before mass immigration. Today it is different. Today there are hundreds of thousands of young men in France who - like Mr Gassama - arrived after a long and dangerous journey, have no proper papers and survive (just about) by working in the black economy. And all of them would dearly love to follow his example. In such circumstances there was bound to be heavy scrutiny of the president's decision. Image copyright Reuters Image caption There are hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants in France In fact, just about everyone agrees that what Mr Gassama did in saving the boy was sufficiently extraordinary to merit fast-track citizenship. But what some people hold against the president is inconsistency. Why, his detractors are asking, do you not apply the same generosity to the rest of the sans-papiers (paperless ones) - all those other Mamoudou Gassamas whose daily misery goes unreported? Why single out one lucky individual? Their indignation is all the sharper because right now an immigration bill is passing through parliament which - in the eyes of the left - puts President Macron clearly in breach of France's historic mission to humanity. Whether his proposed law is nearly as tough or inhumane as his enemies say it is is another matter. Media caption Malian ""Spiderman"" rescues Paris child - then meets French president What is not in doubt is the goal: it is to make matters as clear as possible, as early as possible, to would-be immigrants. If they can stay, they stay. If they have to leave, they leave. They are deported. In his conversation with Mr Gassama, President Macron made clear that had it not been for his chance encounter with a badly supervised child on a hot day, Mr Gassama himself would have been on that list for deportation. But things turned out differently. Mr Gassama reacted with an instinctive generosity of spirit, he performed an act of supreme courage and agility and it was all caught on camera. For President Macron, eager to promote his vision of France as a nation of heroes, this was enough. The act was indeed exceptional and the beneficiary was not just the boy, it was La France. Mr Gassama had qualified.","Mamoudou Gassama's act fitted President Macron's vision of a France of heroes, writes Hugh Schofield.",2018-05-29T12:37:46Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Mamoudou Gassama: Balcony rescue highlights French immigration row,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44291810,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12709/production/_101792557_mediaitem101792556.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,rescue,1
ZEYNEP TUFEKCI,"By contrast, Silicon Valley moguls seem to favor spending money on improbable but impressive-sounding long shots. In 2010, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, donated $100 million to New Jersey schools as part of a multiyear plan to improve them. The centerpiece of the plan was teacher evaluation and charter schools, but it didn’t work well. Some aspects of the plan even made things worse. Education is a complex topic, and making a lot of money in tech is not a qualification for solving educational problems. Silicon Valley also tends to ignore problems in its own house. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has declared that space exploration is one of the main things he should spend his money on. But poorly paid workers in Amazon warehouses, who work under grueling conditions, may have other ideas about how Mr. Bezos might best spend his money. In the case of Mr. Musk and his submarine, the Thai authorities understood that they needed to let the expert cave divers plan and direct the rescue operation (and Mr. Musk, to his credit, said he would take the lead from the divers). But the kind of publicity Mr. Musk created can take on a life of its own and exert undue influence. I don’t mean to dismiss the role of technological innovation. Maybe in the future, some version of Mr. Musk’s contraption could be useful. But that would require long-term development, testing and collaboration with a variety of experts — not just a handful of Mr. Musk’s engineers. If Silicon Valley wants to help the world, there is a lot it can do, starting with making its own products safer and its own companies more just. Perhaps most important, it can develop respect for hard-earned expertise in areas other than its own.",Just because you’re a successful tech mogul doesn’t mean you know how to rescue kids trapped underground.,2018-07-14T19:00:11Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",What Elon Musk Should Learn From the Thailand Cave Rescue,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/opinion/sunday/elon-musk-thailand-hubris.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/15/opinion/15tufekci/merlin_139584531_69bc0e97-626d-4919-a260-4c78fbdba2bf-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,rescue,1

 The town of Sentani was one of the worst affected areas
At least 58 people have been killed in flash floods in the eastern Indonesian province of Papua.
Rescue workers are struggling to reach remote parts of the province, and there are fears the number of dead may rise.
Roads have been blocked by landslides and fallen trees, and floodwaters have damaged two bridges and more than 100 houses.
More than 4,000 people have been forced from their homes, and some are sheltering in government offices.
Local residents said torrential rain began on Saturday evening and continued into the night, triggering mudslides and flash floods.

 Soldiers pulled a five-month-old baby from the rubble
""Our house was flooded with thick mud... we immediately grabbed our valuables and ran to a neighbour's [two-storey] house to seek refuge,"" said mother-of-two Lili Puji Hastuti, quoted by Agence France-Presse.
""It's hard to get out of the area because many roads are blocked... I'm worried, sad and scared all at once.""
The search for victims continues in the town of Sentani, one of the worst affected areas. 
Fifty-one people were killed in the town, national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, quoted by Reuters news agency.
The other seven confirmed deaths were in the nearby provincial capital Jayapura, Mr Nugroho added.
However, a five-month-old baby was rescued in the city after being trapped under the rubble for hours, according to the military.
Meanwhile a propeller aircraft was partly crushed on the runway of Jayapura airport.
Flooding is common in Indonesia, especially during the October-April rainy season.
In January, floods killed at least 70 people on the island of Sulawesi, and heavy rain in West Java earlier in March displaced hundreds.
Emergency officials say that in recent months they had warned the Papuan authorities of flood risks due to deforestation of mountains surrounding Jayapura.

Shannon Connellan,"A new rescue drone has already proved its worth, assisting two swimmers in distress off the coast of Lennox Head, Australia. Unveiled on Thursday morning, then immediately put into action later that day, the ""Little Ripper"" drone is designed to drop inflatable rescue pods to people caught in rips, large swells or experiencing exhaustion in the waves. SEE ALSO: Film underwater in 4K with this versatile drone Around 11:30 a.m., the drone located two young men swimming in powerful surf conditions approximately a kilometer north of the patrolled area — they'd been seen by a member of the public. Within 70 seconds, the drone had flown to the location, piloted by lifeguard supervisor Jai Sheridan, and dropped an inflatable flotation device, which the pair used to stay afloat while swimming to shore. The task would usually take a lifeguard up to 6 minutes to complete. And because it's a drone, the whole thing was caught on camera. The two swimmers cling to the inflatable rescue pod. Image: SLS/NSW DPI/Little Ripper Group It's a collaboration between Surf Life Saving NSW and the State Government, who announced in December it would invest AU $430,000 in drone technology for this trial on NSW's North Coast. Helping to save lives in 70 seconds? Worth the money, in our humble opinion. “Never before has a drone, fitted with a flotation device been used to rescue swimmers like this,” Deputy Premier and Minister for Regional NSW John Barilaro said in a statement. The NSW Department of Primary Industry will also use the drone as a research tool to assist scientists researching marine activity off Northern NSW. Using drone technology for emergency assistance is proving an effective means of cutting aid time in various parts of the world. Shark-spotting drones are patrolling the the skies above Australian beaches, and medical delivery drones could expedite defibrillations, to name a few.

BRAD PLUMER,"Photo In September, Energy Secretary Rick Perry warmed that the loss of coal and nuclear plants could threaten the “reliability and resilience of our nation’s grid” Credit Zach Gibson/Bloomberg, via Getty Images Federal regulators on Monday rejected a proposal by Energy Secretary Rick Perry to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear plants, in a major blow to the Trump administration’s efforts to revive America’s declining coal industry. Over the past decade, an influx of cheap natural gas and the rapid rise of renewable energy has transformed the nation’s power sector, driving down electricity prices and pushing many older coal and nuclear plants into retirement. In September, Mr. Perry warned that the loss of these plants could threaten the “reliability and resilience of our nation’s grid” and asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees regional electricity markets, to guarantee extra compensation to any power plants that can stockpile at least 90 days’ worth of fuel on-site — which, in effect, meant subsidizing coal and nuclear plants. (Natural gas plants are usually fed by pipeline and would not qualify.) While a few power companies with significant coal and nuclear capacity supported the idea, Mr. Perry’s proposal generated a fierce backlash from a broad coalition of utilities, electricity consumers, and former regulators. Critics argued that Mr. Perry’s proposal would upend competition in the nation’s electricity markets, which currently tend to favor the lowest-cost sources of power. And they pointed out that blackouts usually occurred because of problems to transmission lines, not because power plants had insufficient fuel on site. In its decision, FERC largely sided with the critics, although it did say it would conduct its own separate investigation into the resiliency of the nation’s power system, asking grid operators for their own ideas. Four of the five members of the panel were nominated by President Trump.

REUTERS,"President Bashar al-Assad has won back control of nearly all of eastern Ghouta in a Russian-backed military campaign that began in February, leaving just Douma in rebel hands. After a lull of days, government forces began bombarding Douma again on Friday. The offensive in Ghouta has been one of the deadliest of the seven-year-long war, killing more than 1,600 civilians according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Observatory said it could not confirm if chemical weapons had been used in the attack on Saturday. Observatory Director Rami Abdulrahman said 11 people had died in Douma as a result of suffocation caused by the smoke from conventional weapons being dropped by the government. It said a total of 70 people suffered breathing difficulties. Medical relief organisation SAMS said a chlorine bomb hit Douma hospital, killing six people, and a second attack with ""mixed agents"" including nerve agents had hit a nearby building. Basel Termanini, the U.S.-based vice president of SAMS, told Reuters another 35 people had been killed at the nearby apartment building, most of them women and children. SAMS operates 139 medical facilities in Syria where it supports 1,880 medical personnel, according to its website. ""We are contacting the U.N. and the U.S. government and the European governments,"" he said by telephone. Syrian state news agency SANA said the rebel group in Douma, Jaish al-Islam, was making ""chemical attack fabrications in an exposed and failed attempt to obstruct advances by the Syrian Arab army,"" citing an official source. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauret recalled a 2017 sarin gas attack in northwestern Syria that the West and the United Nations blamed on Assad's government. ""The Assad regime and its backers must be held accountable and any further attacks prevented immediately,"" she said. ""The United States calls on Russia to end this unmitigated support immediately and work with the international community to prevent further, barbaric chemical weapons attacks,"" Nauert said in a statement.

Icelandair, a larger airline also based in the country, is now offering reduced fares for those who were affected by the shutdown. According to local news siteIceland Review, an estimated 2,700 to 4,000 passengers have been stranded, and Icelandair is working with those who are stuck in Iceland to bring them home. The airline previously expressed interest in acquiring Wow Air last fall, but scrapped plans after failing to make agreements at their shareholders meetings.
Wow Airs collapse follows a series of other sudden budget airline shutdowns in recent months. This past October, Denmark-based Primera Air abruptly ceased operations and announced plans to file for bankruptcy after experiencing delays in plane deliveries. Last month, British airline Flybmi also shut down without notice, citing inflated fuel costs and uncertainty over how it would operate in the aftermath of Brexit.
Some have speculated that Norwegian Air may be next after the company released a poor earnings report for 2018, which noted that it operated at a loss of 3.8 billion krona (approximately $438 million USD) and needed to raise $350 million. It also began selling planes to makeup for the losses.

MICHAEL PAULSON,"When I was in high school I would go to the old location and sit on the floor and read plays I didnt have the money to buy them, Mr. Miranda said in a telephone interview from Puerto Rico, where he is preparing to star in a three-week run of Hamilton in San Juan that opens on Friday. After college Tommy Kail and I met in the Drama Book Shop basement, and I wrote a good deal of In the Heights there.
In 2016, after a burst pipe caused damage to the shop, Mr. Miranda came to its aid by urging his fans to patronize it. The store needed a lot more help this time.
Theyre like family to us, he said, and when we heard that the rent increase was finally too precipitous to withstand, we began hatching a plan.
The store is particularly important to Mr. Kail, whose post-college theater venture, Back House Productions, was a resident company at the store. I was in many senses professionally born in that bookshops basement I spent the first five years of my career there, he said in a telephone interview from London, where he was checking in on the Hamilton production there.
Mr. Kail and Mr. Miranda both said that they were also inspired by Its a Wonderful Life, in which townspeople rally to save an endangered family banking business. There was no hesitation, Mr. Kail said. The Building and Loan was struggling, and we could do something.
Mr. Sellers office, which is already running a Hamilton merchandise store in Midtown, will oversee the day-to-day management. He said the book shop would have a revamped website and expanded programming; the goal, he said, would be to break even, which in recent years the store has done occasionally but not consistently.","After the bookstore announced it was being forced from its home by rising rents, Mr. Miranda teamed up with “Hamilton” associates and the city on a rescue plan.",2019-01-08T12:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Lin-Manuel Miranda and Friends Purchase Drama Book Shop,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/theater/lin-manuel-miranda-hamilton-drama-book-shop.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/arts/09bookshop1/merlin_104968084_2ab9b23e-dd2f-4625-9756-740585269a93-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,rescue,1

But the new repair plan, in which track work would take place on nights and weekends, may prove to be equally problematic considering it has never been attempted in a tunnel restoration project. This is a “major, major breakthrough,” Cuomo said during a press conference. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority would use an innovative engineering design to keep the tunnel open and operational while it is repaired on nights and weekends, he said. “This is the shortest, best route to the rebuilding of the tunnel,” Cuomo added. The governor said he consulted with Elon Musk’s Tesla, as well as other “out-of-the-box” experts, in his effort to come up with a plan to avert the shutdown. “This is the shortest, best route to the rebuilding of the tunnel.” The L train tunnel, also known as the Canarsie Tunnel, suffered extensive damage during 2012’s Hurricane Sandy, which sent millions of gallons of corrosive saltwater from the East River into the tube. The damage includes tracks, signals, switches, power cables, signal cables, communication cables, lighting, cable ducts, and bench walls throughout the flooded section of both tubes. Cuomo’s announcement comes two weeks after the governor ventured down into the Canarsie Tunnel with a group of hand-picked experts to see for himself if the tunnel needed to be completely shut down for 15 months. The shutdown was first announced in 2016. Cuomo allowed engineering experts from Columbia and Cornell universities to explain how the tunnel repair would commence. Power cables embedded in the tunnel’s bench wall, a ledge that runs along the base of the tunnel that’s used by emergency workers, can instead be hung on racks along the side of the tunnel and wrapped in fiber glass-reinforced polymer. This would allow trains to continue to run while repairs are made. The MTA would also install fiber-optic sensors and LIDAR laser sensors to detect any impending failures in the bench wall, so the agency can send in workers to reinforce those section as needed. This won’t be a “quick fix,” said Lance Collins, dean of the engineering school at Cornell. These methods are typically used to fix bridges, and they haven’t been used in a US tunnel restoration project before, Cuomo added. An MTA official predicted that it could take up to 20 months to complete the plan. It’s an abrupt turnaround for the MTA, which previously argued that the shutdown “cannot be avoided or delayed,” according to the agency’s former chairman Tom Prendergast. But as the impending shutdown grew closer, Cuomo’s disdain for the plan began to show. “I can’t tell you the number of people in Brooklyn who have looked me right in the eye and said, ‘Are you sure that there is nothing else that can be done and there’s no way you can possibly shorten this?’ I said, ‘I will make sure, personally, that there’s nothing else that can be done, and this is the best option,’” Cuomo said recently. Cuomo, who is said to be considering a 2020 run for president, talked up the innovative nature of the tunnel repair plan. “Necessity is the mother of invention,” the governor said. “This is really a unique design, a unique system. We’ll deploy it here. But as you heard, this could be a national model because it is a totally different way to reconstruct a tunnel.”","New York Gov.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP/getty Image caption Power has been now been restored at the site, and rescue hoists have begun A rescue operation is underway to release 955 workers from a gold mine in South Africa after a power cut left them trapped. A spokesman for the mine's operating company said on Friday morning that power had been restored to a lift to release them. The miners have been trapped underground since Wednesday night. South Africa is a leading gold producer, but safety in the industry is often questioned. The Beatrix mine is in Welkom town, about 290km (180 miles) south-west of Johannesburg. It is owned by Sibanye-Stillwater mining firm. It has 23 levels, going down to 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) below ground. Rescued workmen are expected to get taken for food and showers upon their release, before having medical health checks. A reporter for the AFP news agency said several ambulances arrived overnight at the site. Company spokesman James Wellsted said there was ""no indication so far that anyone has been in distress"", but that counselling has been made available to the workers and their families. On Thursday he said water and food supplies had been able to reach the miners, but engineers were struggling to get emergency generators operating. The power outage is believed to have been caused after a storm knocked over an electricity pylon close to the site. Trade union officials had said they feared that the lives of the miners were at risk. More than 80 fatalities were recorded in South African mines in 2017.","The workers have been stuck since Wednesday, after a storm cut electricity and stopped the lifts.",2018-02-02T04:41:50Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",South Africa gold mine: Rescue underway for 955 trapped workers,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-42914132,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CE63/production/_99853825_044476332.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,rescue,1
MALCOLM ROBERTS,"So, are you worried now? Probably not. Thus, humans continue to take chances. And when they get away with them, they take more chances. Conversely, when they lose, they learn. Unfortunately, they usually learn only when they lose. Given this conundrum, I propose that we in the insurance/disaster management world try something new. We need to find ways for people to encounter disasters without actually living through them. We call it pre-experiencing disaster. Were trying this at my workplace for clients and would-be clients. We create six-story controlled warehouse fires and trigger actual explosions. We simulate hurricanes, floods and cyberattacks. We have a platform that mimics the motion of an earthquake and shows how violently and unpredictably a building will move, and even rotate, when the ground shakes. Our visitors feel the heat from the fire. They cringe as a two-by-four hurtles across a room in a simulated hurricane. Their bodies absorb the concussion of an explosion. When they leave, they seem converted. We need to do this kind of education in a broader way that reaches people and businesses in vulnerable communities, places that face threats from hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, flooding and wildfires. In schools, we need to weave disaster and denial stories into classes on physics, earth science psychology, engineering, finance, statistics and the building trades. We need to find ways to tell the stories of people who suffered because of their denial, and who survived because they took the right precautions and built in the proper safeguards. Communities at potential risk should bring in engineers and emergency workers to point out what could fail, wash away, freeze, rot, short-circuit, explode, shatter, cave in or burn up.","United Cajun Navy volunteers make their way to a house to rescue a family stranded by rising floodwaters in Wilmington, N.C., on Sept. 15, 2018.",2018-10-11T16:14:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why We Ride Out Life-Threatening Storms and Do Other Crazy Things,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/opinion/hurricanes-disasters-denial-insurance.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/11/opinion/11roberts/11roberts-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,rescue,1

 The unfortunate rat was almost - but not quite - big enough for its bolthole
In the German town of Bensheim, rescue workers got an unusual call - a chubby sewer rat needed help after getting stuck halfway out of a sewer manhole.
""She had a lot of winter flab and was stuck fast at her hip - there was no going forward or back,"" animal rescuer Michael Sehr told local media.
A fairly large rescue operation ensued - leading some to question why all the effort was spent on saving a sewer rat.
""Even animals that are hated by many, deserve respect,"" Mr Sehr responded.
Volunteer firefighters reacted to a call on Sunday afternoon, the Auerbach fire department said, and noted the ""animal rescue, small animal"" code.
Mr Sehr, from the local professional animal rescue in Rhein Neckar, was already there - but could not free the chunky rodent from the top of the manhole cover.

 It took about eight firefighters and an animal expert to put the sewer rat back where it belongs
With the help of a full team of firefighters, the manhole cover was lifted and propped on wedges while Mr Sehr managed to pop the rotund rodent free.
It was released straight back into the sewer - but not before some close-up photographs were snapped.
Once uploaded to the animal rescue team's Facebook page, they attracted hundreds of comments applauding the care given to an animal that is more often targeted for extermination.

NORIMITSU ONISHI,"But as a fuller picture of the calamity has emerged in the past few days, pledges of money and help have begun coming in from the United Nations, the European Union and individual nations. As aid began to pour in, neighbors across this blistered landscape tried to help one another.
Humanitarian groups are grappling with a double crisis: the brunt of the cyclone itself, and the severe flooding left in its wake.
Nearly a week after the storm hit, heavy rains were still endangering communities isolated by flooding, and complicating efforts by rescue workers to reach them. Rising floodwaters were threatening to partially submerge Buzi, a town of 200,000, not far from Beira, the United Nations warned.
Beira has become a place of refuge for people fleeing flooded areas, but on Wednesday, the whole town still lacked electricity. Cellphone service was extremely limited, and people thronged the few areas with connectivity along the main road.
Fallen trees had yet to be cleared from central Beira, an area with modern buildings and colonial Portuguese homes. Stores and other businesses were closed. There was no activity at the port, the sector that defines the city. Large stores owned by Indians and Chinese, more recent arrivals, were shuttered.
Roofs had been torn off many buildings, but the physical damage was limited.
The greatest destruction was found in the poor rural neighborhoods outside the city center. There, many poorly built houses had collapsed instantly when the storm hit.","Nearly a week after southern Africa was hit by one the worst natural disasters in decades, it was all rescue workers could do to try to reach the victims.",2019-03-20T23:15:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Rescuers Battle Flooding in Desperate Bid to Save Cyclone Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/africa/cyclone-idai-rescue.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/world/20mozambique3/merlin_152347080_0a52cd69-308d-4aab-8299-e8666d2d11c5-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,rescue,1

CARL HULSE,"Immigration activists were furious that Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and his fellow Democrats had given away the best leverage they had to ensure that the young immigrants were protected. “It’s morally reprehensible and it’s political malpractice,” said Ezra Levin, the co-executive director of Indivisible, a liberal group. “Leader McConnell’s track record of keeping his ‘commitments’ is thin at best,” said Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, one of the party’s leading progressive voices. Photo “I think if we have learned anything during this process, it’s that a strategy to shut down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something the American people didn’t understand and would not have understood in the future,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said on Monday. Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times The fierce backlash underscored the challenge confronting Mr. Schumer and more centrist Democrats as they attempt to negotiate with Republicans and President Trump to reach an agreement on immigration without alienating the more liberal factions of a party that has moved distinctly to the left. Their balancing act reflects the broader tension in the party as it tries to reconcile the fervor of blue-state opponents of Mr. Trump and the caution of Democrats in states where they must appeal to Trump supporters. Democrats need to protect 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election in states carried by the president and appeal to the swing voters who could flip control of the House. Those vulnerable Senate Democrats were key to sparking the bipartisan drive to bring the shutdown. Yet many of the Senate Democrats considered potential 2020 presidential candidates voted to keep the shutdown going. Heading into the showdown, Mr. Schumer and other top Democrats figured that Mr. Trump was at a vulnerable moment, given the uproar surrounding racially charged comments made in a recent meeting with senators to discuss immigration, disturbing words that came on top of persistent accounts of Oval Office chaos. And they saw the so-called Dreamers — the young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children — as a particularly appealing group, as they faced deportation to countries they barely knew through no wrongdoing of their own. Polling consistently finds deep American sympathy for those immigrants, and under intense pressure from the left to stand tough, Democrats hoped the public would embrace the use of all possible measures to help them. But over the course of the weekend, Democrats increasingly came to realize they had maneuvered themselves into a difficult position that made many of the party’s moderate senators uncomfortable. Republicans were not distancing themselves from the president despite his erratic swings on immigration policy. And while the Dreamers may be a highly sympathetic group, using them as a rationale for shuttering the federal government was not playing well. The president, top Republicans and their allies had some success in framing the showdown as a case of Democrats putting the interests of “illegal immigrants” ahead of American citizens, a line of attack Democrats felt they could not weather. Mr. McConnell, who sat at his Senate desk with a satisfied smile before the vote to reopen the government on Monday, archly drove that point home in brief remarks. “I think if we have learned anything during this process,” he said, “it’s that a strategy to shut down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something the American people didn’t understand and would not have understood in the future.” In relenting so rapidly, Democrats saw some tangible benefits. They managed to highlight the plight of the Dreamers while avoiding a prolonged shutdown that could have ultimately damaged their cause. And by conceding defeat on Monday, Democrats avoided widespread disruptions in government operations that would have cascaded during the week and beyond. They also won the pledge from Mr. McConnell to allow broad bipartisan negotiations on immigration, overall spending, health programs and other unresolved issues. If those fail to produce an agreement by Feb. 8, he promised to open an immigration debate on the Senate floor. Senators on both sides of the aisle saw that as a breakthrough that could provide a chance for the polarized chamber to engage in what has become a rare occurrence: actual legislating. What they do not have is any certainty that Mr. Trump will back whatever legislation the Senate produces or that the House will even consider it. The agreement to end the shutdown came after weekend negotiations among a bipartisan group of about two dozen lawmakers assembled by Mr. Manchin and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Members of the group all saw the shutdown as unacceptable and contributing to public disgust with Washington, motivating them to pursue a solution outside the chamber’s leadership. They say they are intent on finding a way to protect the immigrants covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program as well as fashioning a “global” agreement on spending, disaster aid and a variety of other issues that have defied resolution. Republican participation in the bipartisan group was crucial for Democrats seeking assurances from Mr. McConnell on the way forward. While they were nervous about accepting the word of Mr. McConnell given their history of clashes with him, they doubted that he would undercut such a substantial number of his fellow Republicans. “I expect the majority leader to fulfill his commitment to the Senate, to me and to the bipartisan group and abide by this agreement,” Mr. Schumer said. “If he does not, of course — and I expect he will — he will have breached the trust of not only the Democratic senators, but members of his own party as well.” Still, immigration activists found fault with putting any faith in Mr. McConnell. And they noted that even if the Senate can draft a measure that attracts a broad majority, it faces a steep test in the House, which ignored a 2013 Senate immigration measure that passed with 68 votes. Negotiations will now begin with Democrats in a new posture. During a Friday meeting with Mr. Trump aimed at settling the dispute, Mr. Schumer said Democrats would agree to provide significant funding for the wall along the Mexican border that Mr. Trump has made a central and symbolic element of his agenda. They had previously opposed any funding for the wall. While Democrats gave that ground, they are not without weapons. Should the negotiations collapse, they will be able to pound Republicans for abandoning the Dreamers. They could also vote again to shutter the government, though that seems unlikely after this episode. As lawmakers looked ahead to a few difficult weeks, Republicans chose not to crow over the outcome. “I think we should be magnanimous,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, in what might be the most telling observation about which side prevailed.

He returned after finding a knoll about three-quarters of a mile away, and on Day 42 they set off for the spot, dragging a makeshift sled with their belongings. A few days later, he left her again and found a frozen pond on which he etched an enormous SOS sign, with an arrow that pointed to their campsite, hoping it would be seen from the air.","Helen Klaben is carried from a rescue airplane in the Yukon Territory in March 1963.

Twilio has also invested grant money in the International Rescue Committee, MindRight and Caravan Studios. Last year, Twilio awarded over $1.5 million in impact funds and plans to award an additional $1.5 million by the end of this year. Edovo works with facilities to bring in secure wireless networks and tablets that access Edovo’s educational platform. The incentive-based learning program covers a variety of areas, including literacy, college course work, cognitive behavioral therapy and vocational training. Upon completion of certain lessons, incarcerated individuals can receive certificates and entertainment options. They can also use Edovo to stay in touch with their loved ones. Right now, Edovo is operating in 20 states in over 50 facilities. To date, over 50,000 people have accessed Edovo’s educational content. “This is government, so there are limitations and challenges to operating with government,” Edovo co-founder Brian Hill told TechCrunch. “As an impact entrepreneur, it’s on us to innovate and figure out how to make it easy to work with challenging organizations.” On average, those who participate in correctional education programs had 43 percent lower chances of returning to prison than those who did not participate in education programs, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. “Our goal is to make sure everyone incarcerated has free access to education on a daily basis,” Hill said. By the end of 2018, Edovo plans to be in all but five states. Another goal is to open up the channel of communication between loved ones and the incarcerated person, Hill said. Ultimately, Edovo’s 2018 is about “creating accessible communications, driving mental health treatment successfully through technology and identifying specifically what drives change in an individual.“ Featured Image: Edovo","Twilio has $250,000 in startup Edovo, which creates tablet-based educational content for incarcerated individuals.

 Rescuers prepare a water pump at the site of the flooded coal mine
A team of Indian navy divers has been deployed in a bid to rescue 15 workers trapped inside a flooded coal mine.
The men had entered the illegal pit, known as a ""rat hole"", in the north-eastern state of Meghalaya on 13 December, and were cut off when floodwater from a nearby river poured in.
Emergency workers equipped with high-power pumps have arrived at the scene.
It is not yet clear whether the miners are still alive.
India's NDTV reports that divers have recovered nothing but three helmets so far.
Officials hope the men may have found an air pocket in the main mineshaft.
""Only God's grace and some miracle can help them to be alive,"" Kyrmen Shylla, Meghalaya's disaster management minister, told Reuters on Wednesday.
Earlier rescue efforts by India's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) were hampered by a lack of equipment. Initially, only two low-power pumps were on hand to drain the water.
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 It is now more than a fortnight since the workers became trapped
The 112m (370ft) deep rat-hole coal mine where the workers are trapped is in East Jaintia district - one of many in the state.
Rat-hole mining involves digging pits into the ground to create a narrow hole to find coal, and is dangerous for those involved. Workers, including children, descend into the mines using bamboo ladders and accidents are common.
The practice was banned in 2014, but mine owners have challenged the ruling in India's Supreme Court.
Most of Meghalaya's illegal miners are migrant labourers who come from neighbouring states to earn money.","High-power pumps arrive at a flooded ""rat-hole"" mine where 15 workers were trapped 16 days ago.",2018-12-29T15:48:25Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Indian miners: Navy divers deployed in rescue bid,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-46710467,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/428E/production/_104983071_mine2.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,rescue,1
Tom McKay,"The heyday of the pager is long since over, but the devices themselves have continued to be used for specialized purposes like search-and-rescue teams and emergency workers. In Japan, however, the funeral bells are officially ringing. According to a recent report in the Japan Times, Tokyo Telemessage Inc., the last remaining pager service provider, will be cutting off the 1,500 remaining users of the devices (some of whom are workers in hospitals who use them because they dont emit electromagnetic waves) by September 2019. Other users of the devices may be older individuals who were reluctant to stop using the technology, according to CNN, as over 20 percent of the Japanese population is over the age of 65. Japan is a high-tech hub, but many older devices like fax machines remain in common usea curiosity sometimes attributed in part to conservative approaches to modernization in its non-manufacturing sector. The countrys top cybersecurity minister, 68-year-old Yoshitaka Sakurada, recently admitted he does not use computers under the excuse that such tasks are handled by subordinates. As Agence France-Presse noted, some international observers were baffled to see Prime Minister Shinzo Abe learning of a North Korean missile that flew over the country via his flip phone. The Times wrote President Hidetoshi Seino said the company will start a new radio service on the frequencies used by the devices for disaster response and relief services. The paper also recalled the heyday of the pager in Japan, which peaked in the mid-1990s and became particularly popular with high school students ( specifically schoolgirls ): For example, the feature allowed users to send short numerical messages such as 0840, which in the Japanese language can be pronounced as ohay (good morning). Other messages following this pattern included 0833, or oyasumi (good night) and 0906, or okureru (Ill be late). The wireless devices were also featured in TV series and songs at the time, becoming a symbol of the age. The number of pager service subscribers peaked at 10.61 million in 1996. But around that time use of mobile phones increased, supplanting beepers. One provider after another ended their service in the years that followed. The last other remaining pager service providers in Japan, NTT Docomo Inc. and Okinawa Telemessage, cut off the devices in 2007 and 2017 respectively. According to CNN, Tokyo Telemessage manufactured its last pagers 20 years ago. However, Japan is far from the only nation where pager use has lingered. Per the BBC, one-tenth of the remaining pagers in the world (130,000) are estimated to be in use by the UKs National Health Service for emergency purposes, which has been criticized as a waste of money at a tab of $8.4 million annually. Just one operator, PageOne, remains operating in the UK. A 2013 report in Fortune noted that they were still somewhat common in some U.S. hospitals, as they are not affected by overloaded cell phone networks during emergencies or signal loss deep inside dense structures.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) only registered the ship last month, after the Gibraltar authorities revoked its flag A rescue vessel operating in the central Mediterranean Sea has had its registration revoked, leaving its future operations in jeopardy. When the Aquarius next docks, it will have to remove its Panama maritime flag and cannot set sail without a new one. It is the last private rescue ship operating in the area used for crossings from Libya to Europe. The charities who run the vessel accuse the Italian government of pressuring Panama into deflagging the Aquarius. The two groups who lease it, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and SOS Mediterranée, say they were notified of the decision by the Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) on Saturday. The authority is said to have described the ship as a ""political problem"" for the country's government, and said Italian authorities had urged them to take ""immediate action"" against them, according to SOS Mediterranée. Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who has previously described the aid boats as a ""taxi service"" for migrants, denies his country put pressure on Panama. On Sunday, he tweeted he ""didn't even know"" what prefix Panama has for telephone calls. Mr Salvini has been a prominent figure in a public immigration crackdown in Italy since his government, a coalition between the right-wing League party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, came to power in June. He has frequently came into conflicts with rescue ship operators and last month was involved in a public stand-off about the disembarkation of 150 migrants on a coast guard ship on the island of Sicily. According to United Nations, more than 1,700 migrants have died trying to cross to Europe in 2018. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Karline Kleijer, MSF's Head of Emergencies, accused European leaders of using ""abusive and vicious"" tactics The Aquarius has been operating in the area since February 2016, finding itself at the centre of diplomatic stand-offs in recent months over disembarkation. It was under the flag of the Gibraltar Maritime Administration until August this year, when it was given ""notice of removal"" and re-registered with Panama. The ship's operators say they were notified of the new decision while on a current mission, and say they have 58 survivors on board from two boats they found in distress. Once it docks, the vessel will now be de-flagged and will not be able to set sail again without being registered with a new maritime authority. In a joint statement, the charities insisted they were in ""full compliance"" with maritime law and denounced the decision as condemning hundreds to death. The statement asks for European governments to step-in to allow the vessel to continue its operations by either reassuring the Panamanian authorities or issuing it a new flag.","The move puts doubt on the future of the Aquarius, the last private rescue ship in the Mediterranean.",2018-09-24T00:28:49Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",The Aquarius: Migrant rescue ship has registration revoked,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45622431,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/178F9/production/_103550569_048682464.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,rescue,1

By comparison, 74 percent of seniors say they will show up on Election Day.

John Biggs,"Researchers at the University of Zurich and EPFL have created a robot that shrinks to fit through gaps, a feature that could make it perfect for search and rescue missions. The researchers initially created a drone that could assess man-made gaps and squeeze through in seconds using only one camera. This extra feature – a scissor like system to shrink the drone in flight – makes it even more versatile and allows these drones to react to larger or smaller gaps in nature. “The idea came up after we worked on quadrotor flight through narrow gaps,” said PhD candidate Davide Falanga. “The goal of our lab is to develop drones which can be in the future used in the aftermath of a disaster, as for example an earthquake, in order to enter building through small cracks or apertures in a collapsed building to look for survivors. Our previous approach required a very aggressive maneuver, therefore we looked into alternative solutions to accomplish a task as passing through a very narrow gap without having to fly at high speed. The solution we came up with is the foldable drone, a quadrotor which can change its shape to adapt to the task.” The system measures the gap and changes its shape without outside processing, a feat that is quite exciting. All of the processing is done on board and it could be turned into an autonomous system if necessary. The team build the drone with off the shelf and 3D-printed parts. “The main difference between conventional drones and our foldable drone is in the way the arms are connected to the body: each arm is connected through a servo motor, which can change the relative position between the main body and the arm. This allows the robot to literally fold the arms around the body, which means that potentially any morphology can be obtained. An adaptive controller is aware of the drone’s morphology and adapts to it in order to guarantee stable flight at all times, independently of the configuration,” said Falanga. The team published a report on their findings in Robotics and Automation Letters. As IEEE notes, this is no flying drone dragon but it is a far simpler, cooler, and more effective product.","Researchers at the University of Zurich and EPFL have created a robot that shrinks to fit through gaps, a feature that could make it perfect for search and rescue missions.

WINNIE HU,"The Williamsburg Bridge, it could be said, was made for its new role. When it opened in 1903, it served as an overflow bridge to ease the traffic backups on its older and more glamorous neighbor, the Brooklyn Bridge. What the new bridge lacked in beauty, it made up in usefulness. At a mile-and-a-third, it was the worlds longest suspension span at the time and the first with all-steel towers supporting its cables. In no time, the bridge became a major transit corridor. Trains cruised down the center. Trolleys ran alongside. Horses, carriages, pedestrians, there was room for all. Later, concrete roadway replaced the trolley tracks, bringing cars and trucks. The bridge opened the way for many Jewish families to migrate to Brooklyn from overcrowded tenements of the Lower East Side earning a nickname as the Jewish Passover. It was also called the Willy B for short. By the 1980s, the Williamsburg Bridge was rapidly crumbling from decades of neglect. Its cables were badly corroded. Chunks of concrete were falling off. It closed for emergency repairs in April 1988 after a large hole was found in a girder. Though part of the bridge reopened several weeks later, the work was just beginning. Then, in 1995, tragedy struck when J and M trains on the same track collided and killed a motorman, spurring widespread safety changes in the signaling system. The Williamsburg Bridge lives in infrastructure infamy, recalled Mr. Pearlstein, adding that many people thought it would be cheaper to simply replace it.","The century-old Williamsburg Bridge stretches across the East River, carrying eight lanes of traffic; pedestrian and bike paths; and the J, M and Z lines.",2018-11-24T00:54:20Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","When the L Train Shuts Down, Will the Williamsburg Bridge Come to the Rescue?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/nyregion/l-train-shutdown.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/24/nyregion/24BRIDGE01/24BRIDGE01-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,rescue,1

NORIMITSU ONISHI,"At the house, his daughter confirmed that the man, Francisco Madjai Mussengere, had been killed by a collapsing roof, and had died waiting for an ambulance blocked by debris. He was 71, she said, adding, He was able to ride the public bus for free.
His oldest son, Elias Francisco, 39, was busy preparing a simple eulogy. In an old, worn notebook, he had recorded the important dates of his fathers life: 1981, arrived in Beira; 1988, joins the Zion Church; 1991-1999, serves as a church elder; 2016, elected pastor.
He had one wife, the son read, and left behind five children and 28 grandchildren.
The family lived not far from a brick factory where Mr. Mussengere had long worked as a supervisor, said the daughter, Graca Francisco. He had left the capital, Maputo, in 1981 to come to Beira to work at the factory.
But after he retired, the factory owner reneged on a promise to build Mr. Mussengere a proper home, she and her brothers said. Instead, he lived in a tiny cinder-block structure.
The unfulfilled dream of a cozy retirement home gnawed at Mr. Mussengere in recent years so much so that he had instructed his children to keep fighting for a new house in the event of his death.
Now, that house has killed him, Ms. Francisco said.","Nearly a week after southern Africa was hit by one the worst natural disasters in decades, it was all rescue workers could do to try to reach the victims.",2019-03-20T23:15:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Rescuers Battle Flooding in Desperate Bid to Save Cyclone Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/africa/mozambique-cyclone.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/world/20mozambique3/merlin_152347080_0a52cd69-308d-4aab-8299-e8666d2d11c5-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,rescue,1
Beth Skwarecki,"Florida overwhelmingly voted to ban greyhound racing, which means that by the end of 2020, thousands of dogs could be out of jobs. The good news is that you can adopt greyhounds at any time. They are very good dogs. Whats happening in Florida? Florida has 11 of the countrys 17 greyhound racetracks, but all of them will have to close in the next two years. A spokesperson for Greyhound Adoptions of Florida told us that: Our most current information is that there are some 4000 greyhounds now on Florida tracks, and we can assume that their owners might opt to move some of them to the 5 states that still have dog racing. There is greyhound racing in Mexico as well. Faster dogs may be able to continue their careers by competing at another track, but the Greyhound Adoption Action Alliance notes that slower dogs at lower-paying tracks often have nowhere to go. So what happens to those 4,000 dogs? At this point, we are not sure, Greyhound Pet Adoption, Florida Southeast told us. Greyhound Adoptions of Florida says, please tell all potential adopters just SIT TIGHT and wait for a few weeks... [until] it becomes more clear which tracks may opt to close sooner and which later. By mid-2019 there should be more information about which tracks are closing when, and what the dogs owners might end up doing with them. Each dog has its own owners, so its up to them, not the track, whether and how they are put up for adoption. Currently, rescue groups in the few remaining states where racing is legal ask owners to donate their dogs, and then they network with other groups so that greyhounds can be adopted nationwide. I adopted mine while I lived in New York, but one came from Kansas and the other from Massachusetts. The Florida groups dont yet have information about how to adopt Florida dogs, but Id bet they will travel through local groups in this way. Getting in touch with your local rescue group is probably the best way to find out when dogs from Florida will be available. Greyhounds are very good pets, yes they are Have you ever met a greyhound? You should meet a greyhound. (Ive adopted two, and they were wonderful.) Google greyhound rescue [your area] and youll probably find several local groups that can arrange adoptions. Greyhounds are weird dogs. They curl up on the couch like cats. They tend to be very calm, often sleepy. They enjoy running, but only as a hobby. Most of the time, like you and me, theyd rather lounge around and watch Netflix. I adopted my first greyhound when I lived in a 500 square foot apartment, and the adoption group didnt bat an eye. They just paired me with a mellow dog and I took her for a long walk every day. Greyhounds can run off unpredictably (they love you, but sometimes they just need that squirrel), so its best to keep them on a leash or in a fenced-in yard. They have thin skin, so they like to wear blankets and pajamas in cold weather. They tend to get along great with other dogs, but some of them have such a strong prey drive that they try to eat cats. If you have cats (or small dogs), let the greyhound rescue know that you need to be matched with a grey that isnt going to chase them. Some greyhounds just dont care. Because greyhounds spend their careers in kennels, they tend to be very used to people and to other dogs, and they take to a crate right away. But they have probably never seen stairs or shiny kitchen floors, and may freak out just a little before they learn how to make their stick legs walk on these foreign surfaces. If you could use a friendly, awkward dog in your life, find your local rescue and ask if they do meet-and-greet events where you could get to know a few hounds. (Many rescues operate out of peoples homes, so there isnt always a shelter to visit.) Maybe you can give one of these unemployed dogs a forever home.","Florida overwhelmingly voted to ban greyhound racing, which means that by the end of 2020, thousands of dogs could be out of jobs.

Tom McKay,"An express elevator in a Chicago building formerly called the John Hancock Center until earlier this year, the 100-story tower at 875 North Michigan Avenue that is the fourth-tallest skyscraper in the city, fell from the Signature Room restaurant on its 95th floor all the way down to the 11th on Nov. 17th due to a broken hoist rope, CBS News reported on Monday. Modern elevator cars are equipped with several hoist ropes, so the car fortunately did not plummet at high speed into the bottom of the shaft, and no one was injured or hospitalized as a result. But CBS News reported those in the elevator believed their deaths were imminent as the car began to slide down the shaft: Visiting from Mexico, Jaime Montemayor didnt expect his trip to Chicago to include getting stuck in an elevator. At the beginning I believed we were going to die, Montemayor said. We were going down and then I felt that we were falling down and then I heard a noiseclack clack clack clack clack clack. His wife, Mana Castillo, said the elevator was moving fast and suddenly a material that looked like dust started filtrating into the elevator.She said they found out later that they had careened from the 95th floor down to the 11th floor. CBS News added that because it was an express elevator, there was no door for rescuers to open on the 11th floor, and an elevator-to-elevator rescue was impossible because the cars stability was compromised. Instead, firefighters broke open a hole in the concrete wall adjacent to the car. According to USA Today, authorities say the rescue took almost three hours to pull off. The Chicago Tribune reported : The first fire crews on the scene had checked the buildings electronic system to get a rough idea of where the elevator was somewhere near the 11th floor of a parking garage, Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said. They drilled a small hole in the concrete wall and inserted a tiny camera on a goose neck wire to look around and find exactly where it was, Langford said. Once they did that, they knew which walls to break.... They put struts up to make sure it cant drop anymore, if anything were to happen, Langford said... The only other way to get to the elevator would have been ropes from the 97th floor, and that would not be safe. We dont come down like Batman so we must go through the wall. City Buildings Department spokesman Gregg Cunningham told the Tribune, That rope is one of several that are connected to the elevator, and, even with this one failing, theres a redundancy in place. Specifics of how it failed, and what type of failure, is still under investigation. Luis Vazquez, a civil engineer from Mexico City and a friend of passenger Jaime Montemayor, told the Tribune, This is the second-most important building in Chicago? And this is the third-most important city in the United States? In the 98 floors, they have no place to open any door? That is the craziest thing. The incident is under investigation, though USA Today reported the elevator in question had passed an annual inspection in July 2018.

SHERI FINK,"What seems like a small detail might resonate in unanticipated ways. For example, well into production on the Magazine story, the editor, Luke Mitchell, allowed me to add a sentence about innovations that included the fact that in Charleston County, S.C., people could provide information to 911 online.
I learned later that several 911 directors reached out to Charlestons 911 director for more information. One was John Dejung from Dane County, Wis. Hurricane Harvey had awakened him to the possibility that his 911 system, one of the largest in a state prone to ice storms, blizzards and tornadoes, might get so bogged down or debilitated that we might want to rely on alternatives to phones. Dane County set aside $10,000 in next years budget for the purchase of a system that will allow people to reach 911 online if necessary in a major disaster.
That alone would likely not have saved Caseys life, but it may save someones. There are myriad ways in which we and the infrastructure and systems we rely on remain unprepared to contend with the natural disasters that seem to arrive ever more frequently and catastrophically. 
All of us have a stake and arguably a role in fixing the most critical problems. But to justify making personal, professional or governmental investments, we need to understand what it looks like when we dont.

Beth Skwarecki,"The first time I saw a wild bird indoors, at my grandmas house, I was so excited because I wanted to keep it. The grownups, meanwhile, were in a slight panic. Everybody in the house was in the room with the bird, gawking at it, hotly debating the best way to evict it. And the bird flapped around looking more and more terrified. 
I dont recall how that bird left the house, but I had a similar experience yesterday. Because we are nerds, I was called downstairs to identify the bird and answer our kids questions about it while my husband looked for a makeshift net. 
I knew the answer on sightit was a house wrenso I looked up what actual wildlife rescue organizations recommend people do with a bird in the house. And it worked. Heres your plan: 
First, Calm the Heck Down
The bird is already scared, and as people surround it, it will become even more scared. Our house wren was happily hopping around the living room when I first saw it, pecking at cracker crumbs my children had left on the floor. But within minutes it was flying restlessly between rooms. 
If the bird is flapping around nonstop by the time you find it, you may have to wait to tire it out. But if its calm, try to keep it that way. Disperse the small crowd that may have gathered.
Make the Area Safe
Remove pets to another room. Turn off the ceiling fan, and cover any hot pots on the stove. 
Choose an Exit
Youre going to try to get the bird to fly out an open door (or, if a door is not available, a window). If possible, find one that will look sunny and invitingyour front door, not a basement door. 
Block the Other Windows and Doors
Darken the room, close any other doors, and close the curtains or blinds. Our kitchen doorway doesnt have an actual door, so I had my husband stand in the doorway holding a towel like a curtain. 
I opened the door to outside, and the wren was in the backyard within seconds. 
If It Wont Leave
A large or scary-looking bird is best left to professionals; call your local animal control or a wildlife rescue group. 
For smaller birds, thats still a good option, but if you feel you must capture the bird, do so gently. This works best once the bird has tired itself out a bit. The Columbus Audubon Society suggests setting a box next to the bird, and using a towel to nudge the bird into a box. (The towel can then become a lid for the box.)
Once you catch the bird, carefully set it free outside. Or if the bird is injured, contact your local wildlife rescue.","Photo: Pexels The first time I saw a wild bird indoors, at my grandma’s house, I was so excited because I wanted to keep it.

"Madeline Holcombe, CNN","(CNN)Three days after a string of tornadoes struck the Southeast, Alabama rescue teams are looking toward recovery and the families of those who died in the storms are preparing to lay their loved ones to rest.
Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones told reporters on Tuesday that heavy equipment is being used to clear debris and that the search and rescue mission will soon move to a recovery status.
Meanwhile, two corporations are stepping in to pay for the funerals of all 23 tornado victims in Alabama.
Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told CNN affiliate WTVM on Tuesday that both corporations wish to remain anonymous.
""What a wonderful blessing this will be for the families who have lost loved ones! To these corporations we thank you!"" the Lee County Sheriff's Office said on Facebook.
Four tornadoes hit central Alabama on Sunday, the National Weather Service in Birmingham said. They left a trail of destruction in their path.
It looked ""as if someone had taken a blade and just scraped the ground,"" Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said.
Harris said that of the 23 people who died in the storms, four were children. Those killed ranged in age from 6 to 89. 
For some, the pain of loss is being feltmany times over.
Erroll Reese told CNN affiliate WRAL that he lost seven members of his family to the tornadoes, and that at least 30 more now are without a home.
Reese told the station in a Monday night interview that fifteen of his family members lived on the same street in a lower middle-class area.
""It's devastating when you think about it,"" Reese said. ""I was sitting there just a while ago thinking, 'How do you handle this, what do you do, who do you reach out to?' And before I knew it, people were reaching out to me trying to help.""
In another family, Makitha Griffin lost five of her family members to the tornadoes.
Her aunts, Florel Tate Stenson, 63, and Tresia Robinson, 62; her uncles, Henry Lewis Stenson, 65, and Raymond Robinson Jr., 63; and her cousin 38-year-old Eric Jamal Stenson were among the nearly two dozen victims of the tornadoes.
A cousin who was in the same house as those killed sustained injuries and is now hospitalized, Griffin said.
Since Monday, Griffin has been feeding first responders who are searching for the missing and helping those who lost their homes. 
She says that growing up, she learned the importance of community.
 ""Everybody was still family whether they were related or not,"" she said. ""We gotta help our families.""
Children among the victims
Taylor Thornton, a fourth grader at Lee-Scott Academy, was also among those killed, Stan Cox, the head of the school, confirmed to CNN after meeting with her parents.
""Very inquisitive, she loved learning and always contributed in a positive way,"" Cox said. ""People were better because they were with her and now our school feels empty without her.""
The youngest victim was Armando Hernandez, 6, family member Sara Crisp said.
Armando, AJ to his family, was described as ""a precious little man that was loved by everyone,"" and who ""was always eager to give hugs and loved his family,"" according to a post on Facebook by his aunt Tina Melton.
Cousins Johnathan Marquez Bowen, 9, and Mykala Waldon, 8, were also killed in the tornado.
Johnathan's mother, Shamel Hart, told reporters at a news conference about the loss of two children in the family, according to CNN affiliate WRBL.
""I did a fireman carry over some trees, and when we got there there was a man in a truck, and he jumped out with a chainsaw and started plowing through trees to make a path for my cousin and me to bring our babies to him. He helped with CPR and transport,"" cried Hart.
As of Tuesday, officials said, the number of missing was seven or eight. 
Dozens of people were injured, with 77 patients from areas affected by the tornadoes hospitalized on Sunday.
Six adult patients remain hospitalized at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, spokeswoman Holly Gainer confirmed to CNN.
Four other patients remain hospitalized at East Alabama Medical Center, according to hospital spokesman John Atkinson.
Lee County Emergency Management Agency director Kathy Carson told reporters at a Tuesday briefing that there has been an outpouring of offers of assistance. She said authorities are organizing a volunteer reception area for those who want to help.
Residents who've lost their homes can get shelter, food and medications, she said.
""We're here for the citizens. We cannot emphasize enough that we want them to communicate and let us know what they need,"" Carson said.
President Trump said he plans to visit Alabama on Friday.
""It's a tragic situation but a lot of work is getting done"" in tackling the storm damage, he said Tuesday at the White House.
The National Weather Service in Birmingham confirmed that four tornadoes hit central Alabama on Sunday. 
Tornadoes are measured on the Enhanced Fujita scale from 0 to 5 based on intensity and damage caused.
Three of the tornadoes were categorized as EF-1, but the Beauregard-Smiths station in Lee County was an EF-4 with winds of 170 mph.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey has extended the state of emergency that had been issued last month because of tornadoes and severe weather and made a request for a federal major disaster declaration.
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency in Grady, Harris and Talbot counties, in the southern part of the state, where he said almost two dozen homes were destroyed and up to 40 sustained damage.
CNN's Pierre Meilhan, Christina Maxouris, Joe Sterling, and Eliott C.

KEN BELSON,"But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.
And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons such as hitting their head on the turf that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.
Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a more fine-grained analysis to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.
Still, he noted, just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense, he said. He also said that from his perspective, this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.
At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hours drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.
When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice, he said of the rugby-style technique. Its a win-win.
As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.","Why rugby? Because its tackling techniques emphasize use of the shoulder, which increasingly appeals to football coaches leery of concussions. Even in Texas.",2019-01-03T05:35:36Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","In Texas, the Land of Football, It’s Rugby to the Rescue",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/sports/ncaafootball/football-rugby-texas-tackling-concussions.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/sports/00tackling-top/00tackling-top-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,rescue,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Thai divers carry supplies as officials prepare for a daring rescue In the bleak hours when there was no news of the missing boys, a new community emerged on the side of this mountain. Divers, cavers, and soldiers all trudged purposefully through the thick mud, focused on their own small role in what felt like a national effort. Now that the 12 boys and their football coach have been located, the mood in the camp has transformed. It is a place of hope, energy, and purpose. Yo Sato is 27. He grew up in east London but returned to Thailand to teach English. He drove for hours to get here to offer his service as a translator for the local police. Image caption Yo Sato is acting as a translator for the police ""I'm speechless, I've got goose-bumps right now,"" he says. ""Seeing those kids alive just changes people's mood. People are working so hard, it's so tiring. But now, they are all smiling. And seeing the British and the Thai working together, it's just the best thing ever."" Classmates of the young footballers come to the mouth of the cave to show their support. At the spot where their friends last glimpsed the outside world, they sing for them. ""Believe in God. Only belief can move a mountain,"" go the lyrics of the song they sing. Image caption Emergency teams are preparing to help bring the boys to safety Looking on, just a few metres away, are the rescue teams, planning how they can enter this particular mountain and bring the boys to safety. Everywhere you turn, small squadrons of men and women in matching colours huddle and nod in agreement. They are surrounded on every side by scores of international news teams who have filled this corner of a usually tranquil forest. Image caption The rescue effort is creating headlines round the world It is the Thai Navy Seals the journalists want to talk to the most. Videos of the boys posted to Facebook by the Seals have delighted and amazed people at the camp. There are other, regular soldiers too who don't get the same star treatment. But you feel their presence. Every now and then they emerge from their makeshift barracks and stand arm in arm, in a human chain. Their role is to block the media's path when heavy machinery is brought in, or when the medical teams are rehearsing for final stages of a rescue. They can be seen carrying empty stretchers out from the entrance to the cave and placed in ambulances which speed off into the distance. Image caption Thai soldiers are helping to maintain order outside the cave It is still not clear when the soldiers will be called upon for real. Until that time, an army of volunteers needs to be fed. Servers in yellow uniforms scoop steaming rice and fish curry on to plates for a never-ending queue of hungry workers. In fact, there is a wide choice and favourite dining spots are emerging. Workmen drenched in sweat and cave water lurk optimistically to see if the next fresh batch of chicken is ready. And the most popular woman in Thailand appears to be the one who loudly declares the ice-creams have arrived. Among the servers is Lakhana Didyasarin, the director of the American School of Bangkok. ""I have brownies, cookies and hotdogs,"" she says. Image caption Lakhana Didyasarin says she has faith that the boys will be brought out safely In fact, she brought 1,600 hotdogs, and they are all gone. It was her duty as a Thai to come and help, she says, and it was a ""dream came true"" when the boys were found. ""We have found them now,"" she says. ""The second stage will be much easier. We have doctors, nurses, experts - every person needed to help them out.""

Laura Byager,"One particular scene had people on the edge of their seats during the latest episode of BBC's latest David Attenborough nature documentary, Dynasties. It followed a group of emperor penguins trying to survive the brutal winter in Antarctica. When a particularly nasty storm blew some of the penguins down into a ravine with walls too steep for them to climb, things got almost too real. SEE ALSO: David Attenborough's latest nature show has a brilliantly original twist Some penguin mothers abandoned their chicks as they pecked their way out of the ravine, while others were just hopelessly stuck without hope of getting out. That's when the Dynasties crew, in a move later called ""unprecedented"" by BBC Earth on Twitter, decided to prevent nature from taking its course and act. Having watched the abandoned penguins and chicks try to get out of the ravine for days with no luck, they intervened as the chicks started dying in the ravine. ""We've given it a lot of thought, we've decided we're definitely going to dig a shallow ramp that they'll hopefully use,"" director William Lawson tells the camera, as the crew gets their shovels out and start digging a path for the penguins to follow out of the ravine. Then, as the penguins then make their way out, viewers let out a collective sigh of relief on social media.

EMMA G. FITZSIMMONS,"Subway service is often terrible. More than 60,000 trains were delayed last month. The on-time rate for subway trains has not significantly improved. Only about 68 percent of trains were on time this past summer, up slightly from 65 percent the summer before the lowest rate since the subway crisis of the 1970s. Carl Weisbrod, an M.T.A. board member and a former chairman of the citys planning commission, said he thought the rescue plan had produced only a marginal improvement. Subway officials say workers have cleaned 285 miles of track, repaired 1,300 signal defects and upgraded 1,600 subway cars. The agency has hired more than 1,000 additional workers. Riders may be delayed in part because of all the work taking place on the tracks to improve the system, Mr. Byford said.

George Dvorsky,"Imagine the frightening scenario—dramatized in movies like Gravity and 2001— where an astronaut gets sick or disoriented during a spacewalk. Confused, and on the cusp of losing consciousness, she struggles to operate the suit’s jetpack. Unable to get her bearings, and without a tether to keep her secured to the space station, she drifts farther and farther away until all hope is lost. Now instead of that scenario, imagine the struggling astronaut presses an emergency button which automatically takes her back to the International Space Station or another space-based habitat. Such a system is currently under development at Draper Labs, and it could soon become a standard feature on spacesuits. To develop this “take me home” technology, Draper’s engineers had to design a system capable of pinpointing an astronaut’s location relative to the return point, and compute an optimal return trajectory taking time, oxygen consumption, safety, and clearance considerations into account. There’s no GPS in orbit, of course, and preventing the astronaut’s head from smashing against a solar panel would probably be a good thing. Fundamentally, the technology needed to be able to guide a disoriented (and possibly unconscious) astronaut back to the awaiting craft. To that end, Draper’s new system is capable of monitoring movement, acceleration, and relative position of a spacewalking astronaut to a fixed object, such as the ISS. “Giving astronauts a sense of direction and orientation in space is a challenge because there is no gravity and no easy way to determine which way is up and down,” explained Kevin Duda, a space systems engineer at Draper, in a statement. “Our technology improves mission success in space by keeping the crew safe.” When enabled, the suit’s “take me home” system can operate the jetpack autonomously, or provide the the astronaut with directions using sensors or via the helmet’s visor display. The self-return system can be initiated by the astronaut, the crew onboard the space station, or members of mission control down on Earth. Duda and his colleagues at Draper only recently filed a patent for the system, so it may be a while before we see functional, space-capable versions. Importantly, however, NASA co-funded this spacesuit project, so there’s a major player interested in its development. That said, this system could be applied to other applications, such as when firefighters are incapacitated by smoke, or scuba divers struggling in the ocean.

George Dvorsky,"Sub-Saharan Matabele ants are ruthless killers, raiding termite mounds two to four times each day. But every once in a while, an ant gets hurt and is hauled back home to recuperate—an astonishing insectoid behavior unto itself. New research suggests there’s even more to it than that—these ants also administer medical care to those wounded in battle. At nearly 0.8 inches (20 mm) in length, Matabele ants are among the world’s largest ants. They’re named after the fierce Matabele warriors, a Bantu tribe that wreaked havoc in southern Africa in the 19th century. Like their namesake, Matabele ants are formidable warriors, marching in along rows of 200 to 600 individuals toward termite-infested foraging sites. In a behavior never seen before in an insect species, predatory ants were observed to retrieve… Read more Read But the termites aren’t defenseless. Their soldiers are well-armored and equipped with powerful jaws that can take a chunk out of a marauding Matabele ant. Injuries and deaths are common for members of the invading party, but as researchers from Germany’s University of Würzburg discovered last year, these ants have developed a kind of search-and-rescue system to reduce fatalities. While observing ants in Comoe National Park in Ivory Coast, the scientists learned that wounded give out a distress signal by excreting a pair of chemicals. These chemicals trigger a behavior among the fellow soldier ants, who grab their wounded comrades and drag them back home to recover. Incredibly, upwards of 95 percent of ants who were brought back to home base managed to recover and then participate in subsequent raids, compared to the 32 percent of ants who died on the battlefield without any help. The researchers calculated that this rescue behavior results in a colony that’s about 29 percent bigger than it would be otherwise. Cool right? But as the same team of researchers now point out in the latest issue of Proceedings of the Royal Society B, there’s more to the rescue than just bringing the wounded back—the Matabele ants also administer the ant-equivalent of medical care. And like the search-and-rescue efforts, it’s a behavior unique to the entire animal kingdom. Except for humans, of course. Once back at the home nest, the researchers watched as the soldier ants intensively “licked” the wounds of the injured, sometimes for several minutes. “We suppose that they do this to clean the wounds and maybe even apply antimicrobial substances with their saliva to reduce the risk of bacterial or fungal infection,” said lead researcher Erik Frank in a statement. For the study, some experiments were done in the field, like the ones with heavily injured ants, and some in the lab, namely the observations of the wound treatment inside the nest. Both the field and lab experiments were conducted at the Comoé National Park Research Station in Ivory Coast. Fascinatingly, the soldier ants also do some “triaging” on the battlefield—but the decision as to who lives and who dies is made by the injured ants themselves. By lashing out and struggling wildly, severely wounded ants—some missing multiple limbs—make it impossible for their would-be rescuers to help. The severely wounded ants “simply don’t cooperate with the helpers and are left behind as a result,” explained Frank. By doing so, they ensure that the ants who are most likely to survive are the ones who get rescued, while also making sure no unnecessary energy is expended in what would be a futile rescue. By contrast, less injured ants “signal” their cries for help by remaining still and orienting their limbs and bodies for easy transport. This behavior also gets them noticed by uninjured ants, and by keeping still, the ants may be localizing their chemical “save me” signal to single location. It’s a neat study, but there’s still a lot of work to do. Frank’s team needs to investigate the “licking” behavior to further understand its role and function (e.g. does it help with healing, or prevent further infection?), and figure out how the ants are so good at pinpointing the location of an injured comrade. For ants, this Borg-like behavior makes a lot of sense. Understanding the behavior of the single individual can only be understood in the context of the whole; by sacrificing themselves in this way, the ants are helping to preserve the strength of the entire colony.

Emily Price,"A few years ago my boyfriend and I took a WOW Airlines flight to Scotland. The flight was inexpensive and included a 17-hour layover in Iceland, where we spent the afternoon at the Blue Lagoon.
Now it looks like those cheap European flights, at least those run by WOW Air, will be a thing of the past. WOW Airlines announced that it has ceased operations Thursday and that all WOW Air flights have been canceled.
If you have an upcoming vacation planned on WOW thats a bummer, and means youll need to find a new way to get to your destination. If youre already on that vacation its an even bigger issue, because now you have to figure out how to get home.
What can you do?
The tl;dr on this front is that youre on your own, for the most part. Since WOW is no longer an airline, youre not going to get any help from them in figuring out your travel plans.
This is one of the few instances where buying travel insurance would have been a great idea. If you purchased a WOW Air flight and purchased travel insurance for it, then contact your insurance provider to see what they can do for you.
If you purchased your ticket using a credit card, then you should contact your credit card company to see if you can get a refund for your ticket from them. In most cases, a credit card company will be able to get you a refund.
On the page announcing the shutdown, WOW notes that passengers that purchased their ticket from a European travel agent (within the European Economic Area) as part of a package tour that included flights, as well as things like hotels and tours, are protected by the Package Travel Directive.
All that said, some airlines are also offering rescue fares that can make rebooking slightly less of a nightmare.
Whats a rescue fare?
If youre mid-trip right now, then finding a new plane ticket is probably your biggest obstacle. Its also likely to be a big expense.
If youre in Europe, then a few different airlines are offering rescue fares that make replacing that lost plane ticket a bit less expensive. While youll still have to purchase your ticket at a last-minute flight price, the BBC notes that Wizz Air, Easyjet and Norwegian are all offering discounts to make the hit more bearable. Contact those airlines directly to see what they can offer you with your specific destinations. Id recommend trying the phone first over standing in line at the counter at the airport.
Norwegian specifically has said it would offer fares at a 25% discount for passengers that have had their flights canceled by WOW. In order to get the discount, youll just need to show the airline a valid WOW Air booking. The discounted fares are available until April 8th.
Icelandair is also offering a discount fare for stranded passengers. The fares are only good for passengers who have already begun their trip and have a return fare booked between March 28 and April 11, 2019. It is offering flights at flat rates. Specifically, flights to/from Europe for $60, to/from North America for $100, and Europe/North America/ North America-Europe for $160. Fares also include one piece of carry-on luggage up to 23 pounds and one checked bag up to 50 pounds. Its site has more info on how to obtain one of those.
And like every other airline problem, try to stay calm and be as friendly as possibly to airline representatives. This is an unusual event, and while being stuck somewhere or having your vacation plans canceled sucks, yelling at a stranger isnt going to make that problem any better, if anything it could make things worse.","A few years ago my boyfriend and I took a WOW Airlines flight to Scotland.

Emily Lipstein,"Newly proposed guidelines under consideration by the Unicode Consortium, the non-profit group that maintains Unicode as the international standard for symbols across software platforms, could soon radically change the way we use emojis. Yes, I mean that Unicode may finally update emoji standards to let your favorite symbols face either direction instead of just one way. Consider this situation: you’re looking through some pics of Animals Doing People Things online and come across this masterpiece by artist Ellen van Deelen : And you think to yourself, “Look at how talented these enterprising young rodents are,” and “I would like to celebrate this opus by recreating it using emoji,” like so: 🎷🐁 📯🐀. In our CMS, Kinja, it’s rendered one way such that the mouse can play. In Apple’s iOS, it’s rendered the way it is in the image at the top of this post. So depending on how these emojis are translated between platforms, you could be saying one thing while your recipient could be interpreting it completely differently. So why not allow users to simply choose the direction they want their emoji to face? It’s not like there are sixteen different arrow emojis to choose from to imply the direction of action in a string of emojis that would definitely clear something like this up without needing to overhaul the system. Here’s another situation that would be rectified if we get the option to choose which direction your emoji faces: you’re putting together another band of animals using emojis on your iPhone, but the poor snail (🐌) isn’t facing the right way to play the saxophone, so you have to give it to the caterpillar instead 🎷🐛. According to Emojipedia, there are 2666 emojis in the “Unicode Standard” as of June 2017, meaning that there must be ENDLESS situations in which aesthetic confusion is created by emoji that face the wrong way. It’s not like we can just flip the emojis the right way in our brains! It’s a NECESSARY EVOLUTION! The proposal to include this change in a future round of Unicode’s emoji updates is just a draft at this point and might not ever become a feature on your phone. In fact even if unicode adopts the proposal, vendors like Apple would end up making the ultimate decision of which emojis will get to face both ways, and an update allowing that feature wouldn’t come until iOS 12, which should debut sometime next fall. Until everyone wises up, then, we’ll just have to make due with snail-less emoji bands.","Newly proposed guidelines under consideration by the Unicode Consortium, the non-profit group that maintains Unicode as the international standard for symbols across software platforms, could soon radically change the way we use emojis.

Aimée Lutkin,"The Internet loves a viral story about a dog who didn’t make it through government or police training programs, because it means the dog refused to become a total narc. This actually isn’t a rare problem; lots of dogs aren’t suited to service. They still need homes. According to Insider, there are a number of adoption agencies that specialize in dogs who never made it all the way through their schooling. Before you romanticize them as renegades too much, know that many dogs are trained for services that have nothing to do with sniffing out drugs or aiding the CIA. But, yes, there is an adoption service run by the TSA for pups who did “not meet the TSA Canine Training Center criteria for government work.” The TSA has an adoption application, a set of home requirements, and they warn that some of these dogs may be “highly active and in most cases, untrained and not house broken.” Insider adds that you would turn to this program only if you’re especially interested in German Shorthaired Pointers, Labrador retrievers, German shepherds, and Belgian Malinois dogs, as only certain types of dogs are even tapped for this kind of training. This might not be a scenario that suits every household, so apply with caution. Also consider that this is not the way to get a trained working dog on the cheap. Some of the dogs did pass their training, had a career, and now their watch is ended. Mission K9 Rescue, for instance, looks for homes for retired dogs and says expressly on their website, “Their work is finished.” Dramatic, but true. They are only good as companions. Freedom Service Dogs of America tries to make rescue dogs into service animals, and only adopts out those who can’t complete the training. The same is true for Service Dogs Inc.; there are a myriad reasons why dogs wouldn’t get through their training, including being “easily distracted” or having physical issues, or simply being “too timid for the line of work.” All these dogs are good for is cuddles, so don’t demand anything from them except love.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NSW government Image caption The drone dropped an inflatable rescue device to help the struggling teenagers Two teenage boys were rescued by a brand new lifesaving drone in Australia while lifeguards were still training to use the device. The swimmers, aged 15-17, had got into difficulties off the coast of Lennox Head, New South Wales (NSW). A member of the public spotted them struggling in heavy surf about 700m (2,300ft) offshore. Lifesavers instantly sent the drone to drop an inflatable rescue pod, and the pair made their way safely to shore. John Barilaro, the state's deputy premier, praised the rescue as historic. ""Never before has a drone fitted with a flotation device been used to rescue swimmers like this, he said. Lifeguard supervisor Jai Sheridan was piloting the device when the alarm was raised. He described the experience as ""unreal"". ""The Little Ripper UAV certainly proved itself today, it is an amazingly efficient piece of lifesaving equipment and a delight to fly,"" he told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. Image caption New South Wales has invested in drones to help spot sharks and rescue swimmers or surfers in trouble (file picture) Image copyright NSW government Image caption After grabbing the rescue pod the boys were able to swim back to shore - exhausted but otherwise unharmed. Mr Sheridan said it took just a minute or two to launch the drone, fly it to the rescue site, and drop the pod. Any other day, reaching the teenagers could easily have taken three times as long. The drone's camera also recorded the whole rescue. The NSW state government revealed in December that it had invested A$430,000 ($340,000 / £247,000) in a fleet of drones. While some are designed to spot sharks, others feature flotation pods, alarms and loudspeakers.

ADAM GOLDMAN,"The trial comes at a difficult time for the F.B.I., which has been repeatedly maligned by President Trump for investigating whether any of his associates colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. A conviction would be a black eye for the bureau and in particular the hostage team, which has been involved in some of the country’s most sensitive counterterrorism operations. The F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, praised the hostage team during an appearance last month before Congress, noting it had recently carried out more than two dozen missions. Created in 1983, the rescue team also has worked closely overseas with American military commandos. This month, the judge dismissed two of the charges against Mr. Astarita, handing his defense a partial victory. But the judge also refused to allow defense lawyers to question an Oregon State Police trooper at the scene about who fired the shots. He thought one of his fellow troopers fired into Mr. Finicum’s truck but did not witness it. The judge said the trooper could testify only about what he saw. Little evidence ties Mr. Astarita to the shooting. Authorities never found the bullets or the casings, and neither the troopers nor the agents saw Mr. Astarita discharge his gun. Grainy surveillance footage taken from an F.B.I. plane shows agents milling around after the shooting. One can be seen bending over and possibly picking up something. The case essentially boils down to a computer model that points to Mr. Astarita as the possible shooter based on the trajectory of the bullets. Mr. Astarita’s lawyers call the model flawed, saying it is impossible to determine his exact position during the shooting. They also believe that a state trooper standing near Mr. Astarita was most likely responsible. During the confrontation, a pair of troopers fired a total of six shots. One shot three times into Mr. Finicum’s truck as it barreled down the road before crashing into a snowbank. Both troopers then opened fire on Mr. Finicum, 54, as he exited the truck, hitting him three times. The trooper who fired at the truck, a veteran of the Oregon State Police and now a captain, was involved in at least three other shootings and cleared in all of them. Defense lawyers are expected to question the captain, but he will not be identified by name during the trial because of threats made on his life, the judge said.","The agent, who is a part of the F.B.I.’s elite Hostage Rescue Team, is accused of lying about a deadly clash that killed a prominent anti-government activist.",2018-07-24T09:00:08Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",F.B.I.

When student Gabby Tropea found herself  accidentally locked out of her house, she decided to try the back sliding door. Unfortunately, that turned out to be locked, too. This is where Boco, her cat comes in.
The rear door was locked with a wooden bar, which needed to be removed. Tropea managed to trick Boko into clawing at the bar by tapping on the glass, and eventually, Boko managed to unlock the sliding door.

AJ Dellinger,"An FBI hostage rescue team ran into some unexpected obstacles while conducting a raid last winter when a criminal gang unleashed a swarm of drones to disrupt the operation and obscure the view of agents conducting the mission from an elevated observation post. According to Defense One, the incident—which took place outside of an undisclosed major US city—was recounted by Joe Mazel, the head of the FBI’s Operational Technology Law unit, at the AUVSI Xponential conference in Denver, Colorado. It’s just the latest example of criminals leveraging drones and other technology to fluster law enforcement. Mazel told attendees of the conference that a group of drones made a series of “high-speed, low passes at agents in the observation post” in an attempt to flush them out of from their position. “We were then blind,” Mazel said. He admitted the swarm made the operation much more difficult and “presented some challenges.” While the case is considered “law enforcement-sensitive,” which prevents many of the details from being shared publicly, Mazel did provide some detail s to how the situation happened. Defense One reported the chief of the operational tech unit for the FBI said the suspects carried the drones in backpacks in anticipation of law enforcement’s arrival. Once the FBI showed up, the criminals unleashed the drones and buzzed the agents attempting to conduct the raid. In addition to obstructing the view of the hostage rescue team members, the criminals also used camera-equipped drones to track the location of agents on the ground. The drones provided a live video feed of the action from overhead, which members of the gang were able to watch in real time on YouTube. “They had people fly their own drones up and put the footage to YouTube so that the guys who had cellular access could go to the YouTube site and pull down the video,” Mazel told the conference. Drones used in this matter present something of a worst-case scenario for law enforcement officers. The technology is relatively cheap, commercially accessible, and provides some pretty powerful tools for disruption, transportation, and surveillance in a small, portable package. Police have warned in recent years that drones have been used to surveil buildings and homes being targeted by robbers. Smugglers have started to utilize the technology to move contraband across borders. Criminals have even found ways to weaponize drones with explosives and other harmful materials. Of course, law enforcement isn’t exactly innocent on this front either, as they have their own questionable intentions for the technology. Local and federal agencies have been all too happy to try to push for drones that can be used to do everything from intercepting cell phone signals to spying on citizens without a warrant to killing people. Lawmakers will have an opportunity to help curb some of the criminal activity committed with drones in an upcoming Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill. A current version of the legislation would make it illegal to weaponize consumer drones and would require drone pilots operating the devices outside of their line of sight to remotely identify themselves so law enforcement can connect the device to a person. Those rules will only work if the FAA actually enforces them, and the agency has been pretty bad at that so far.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA / Thai Navy Image caption The Thai military (pictured) and civilians have joined forces to try to save the boys Teams have a three to four-day window to save 12 Thai boys and their football coach from a cave where they have been trapped for two weeks, according to the leader of the rescue efforts. Narongsak Osottanakorn said conditions were currently ""perfect"". There is concern that monsoon rains could follow, further flooding the narrow passages. The boys were exploring the cave when they and their football coach became trapped by rising waters on 23 June. Rescue divers have since been able to take them food, oxygen and medical assistance, while a huge international team works on a plan to free them. ""Now and in the next three or four days, the conditions are perfect [for evacuation] in terms of the water, the weather and the boys' health,"" said Mr Narongsak, governor of the Chiang Rai province, where the caves are. ""We have to make a clear decision on what we can do."" There was a short burst of heavy rain on Saturday night after he spoke, and it is unclear whether this will have affected the plans. Earlier in the day, the Thai Navy Seals released the letters the boys sent to their families, via rescue divers, reassuring them. ""Don't worry, we are all strong,"" one child said in a note. ""Teacher, don't give us lots of homework!"" he joked. Another wrote: ""Nick loves Mum and Dad and siblings. If I can get out, Mum and Dad please bring me mookatha [Thai barbecue] to eat."" The football coach who took the boys into the cave apologised to parents, but several of them have said they do not blame him. What is the plan? A huge military and civilian operation is racing against the clock to bring the group out amid high risks. The danger of the situation became clear when a former Thai navy diver died after delivering air tanks to the group on Friday. The boys are currently perched on a dry shelf, but rain could reduce that space to ""less than 10 sq m (108 sq ft)"", Mr Narongsak said. Media caption Dr Alex Rowe explains the impact of being trapped underground Officials say an oxygen line has been installed to counteract the increased carbon dioxide that comes from so many people breathing within such a small area. Bore holes have also been drilled into the rock to try to drain water out and give the boys more time. It has previously been said that they could be underground for months, either learning to dive or waiting for the water to recede or be pumped out. Media caption Heavy rain is not expected until late in the week in the area where the boys are trapped in a cave Earlier on Saturday, Mr Narongsak said the boys had not yet learned the diving skills to allow for their safe passage. The ideal scenario is for enough water to have been pumped out to allow them to climb out. Mr Narongsak has not specified the course of action for these next few crucial days. How did this happen? The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers on Monday, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. Aged between 11 and 16, they belong to a football club called the Wild Boars, and became trapped during an excursion with their coach. It took ten days to find them in the underground network's dark depths.","The local governor says conditions are now ""perfect"" to get trapped boys out but the plan is unclear.",2018-07-07T21:29:22Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Thailand cave rescue: 'Four-day window' for boys to escape,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44754335,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7492/production/_102424892_cave2.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,rescue,1
Mark Kaufman,"Guards at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, in Kenya, now only have to keep watch over two northern white rhinos — and their much sought-after horns. The last male northern white rhino, named Sudan, died at the wildlife conservancy this week after succumbing to old age and failing health. There are just two females left from the subspecies, Fatu and Najin, who continue to graze at the protected wildlife park. Unless a still unproven reproductive technology in rhinos — in vitro fertilization (IVF) — is used to sustain the subspecies, the northern white rhinos will soon go extinct. SEE ALSO: Trump administration nixes ban on hunted elephant tusks being carried into the U.S. There's a melancholy around the grounds, said Richard Vigne, head of the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, but even after Sudan is buried at the conservancy, Vigne insists the rhino won't be forgotten. ""Our aim is to build a legacy off the back of Sudan and use him as an ambassador for endangered species,"" he said in an interview. But Vigne, like other rhino conservationists, isn't relying upon IVF technology — which involves fertilizing an egg in a lab and then inserting the small embryo into a female rhino — to be the savior of any rhino species, all five of which are endangered. Headstones of rhino graves at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy. Image: AFP/Getty Images Protecting rhinos and finding secure land for them to roam requires a lot of cash, which is limited. ""The biggest challenge that faces rhino conservation is cost,"" said Vigne, who notes that the conservancy's revenue is dependent upon tourists visiting Kenya. Generally, limited conservation cash leaves little for investment in expensive laboratory research solutions, like IVF. Achieving this technology is estimated to cost in the range of $9 million. Some might balk at that number, but it can also be viewed as a relatively small investment. ""Something like $35 billion is spent by the British [each year] to look after their dogs or cats,"" said Vigne. ""So $9 million to save a species is not a lot of money."" Still, the technology doesn't yet exist. Rhinos, the second largest land mammals after elephants, can only realistically be saved the old fashioned way, by letting rhinos simply live as rhinos, according to the conservationists. ""We should be focusing conservation efforts on allowing white rhinos to do what they do best on the broad African landscape — to roam the landscape and make lots of baby rhinos,"" said Michael Knight, Chairman of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) African Rhino Specialist Group, in an interview. The fate of Sudan and the northern whites can be counted as many things — including failure and tragedy — but Knight emphasizes that the other white rhino subspecies, the southern whites, is still here and doing significantly better. The southern whites number around 20,000 individuals, and as they're the same species, their genetic makeup is extremely similar, said Knight. Armed guards at a black rhino reserve in Nanyuki, Kenya. Image: LightRocket via Getty Images Additionally, the remaining two northern whites aren't exactly representative of a healthy, vibrant population. Dwindling numbers meant that genetic variability — necessary for sustaining large populations with diverse genes — had largely diminished. ""They're highly inbred so they’re a poor reflection of what they were like historically,"" said Knight. All rhinos, however, face the same threat: Demand for their horns. There's an old myth in some Asian countries that grinding rhino horns into powder and adding it to drinks can mend one's health. And today, drinking this powder has now become a symbol of wealth and status. ""It's rather like having a Porsche parked outside your front door,"" said Vigne. ""It puts a high price on a rhino's head."" Allowing the remaining African white and black rhinos to survive requires a ""two-pronged"" approach, said Vigne: Making it riskier to poach rhinos and decreasing demand for rhino horns. Increasing hunting risk means adding ""a good security arrangement"" around rhinos, such as armed guards, and requiring strict punishments for horn poachers. Poachers have been sentenced up to 30 years in prison in Kenya. To further discourage poachers, it's also become commonplace to repeatedly cut rhino horns off (they grow back), so they have less reason to shoot the animals. Some have even proposed the more drastic measure of creating rhino farms, to produce horns to appease market demand, said Vigne. But this could open up a Pandora's Box of desire for rhino horn powder. ""It would be out of the box and impossible to put back in,"" said Vigne. If the IVF reproductive technology is ever developed, however, it might also one day help other endangered rhinos, like the Sumatran, Javan, and African black rhino species, should their populations get poached down to such extreme levels. ""They're facing exactly the same challenges,"" said Leah Drury, a rhino keeper at the Longleat Safari Park in the UK. But, she notes the technology has never been proven in rhinos, so expectations should be tempered. ""I think we have a little way to go yet,"" said Drury. An egg-retrieval procedure at Longleat Safari Park. Image: Courtesy of Longleat Longleat has donated eggs from three of their rhino cows to the research cause, which in itself is an endeavor. Gathering the eggs requires reaching 1.5 meters into the animals. The eggs were frozen in 2017 and shipped to a lab in Italy, where they could be fertilized. Proving IVF for rhinos might be a commendable achievement, but conservationists would need to insert the embryos into many southern white females (who would have to serve as surrogate mothers for the northern whites) to produce enough northern whites to sustain a genetically healthy population. The challenges are many, so for now, rhino conservationists are concentrating on the more feasible challenge of finding protected land for rhinos to roam, graze, and ""let natural selection work,"" said Knight. ""So if things start hitting the fan like increased poaching somewhere, at least you’ve got your eggs in many baskets,"" he said.","Guards at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, in Kenya, now only have to keep watch over two northern white rhinos — and their much sought-after horns.

 The ""dog"" was treated by vets at an animal clinic
Kind-hearted Estonian workers rushed to rescue a dog in distress from a freezing river on Wednesday - unaware of the fact they were actually about to bundle a wild wolf into their car.
The men were working on the Sindi dam on the Parnu river when they spotted the animal trapped in the icy water.
After clearing a path through the ice, they took the frozen canine to a clinic for medical care.
Only then was it revealed they had been carrying a wolf.
Image copyrightEUPAImage caption
 The wolf was covered in ice when pulled from the near-frozen water
The Estonian Union for the Protection of Animals (EUPA) said the wolf had low blood pressure when it arrived at the veterinarian's office, which may have explained its docile nature after the men carried it to their car to warm it up.
Speaking to the Estonian newspaper Postimees, one of the men, Rando Kartsepp, said: ""We had to carry him over the slope. He weighed a fair bit."" 
""He was calm, slept on my legs. When I wanted to stretch them, he raised his head for a moment,"" he added.
Veterinarians had some suspicions over the large dog's true nature, but it was a local hunter, familiar with the region's wolves, who finally confirmed it for what it was: a young male wolf, about a year old.

 ""He was calm, slept on my legs,"" Mr Kartsepp said of the journey to the vet's office
Armed with this new information, clinic staff decided to put the wolf in a cage after treatment - in case it became less docile once it recovered.
The EUPA said it paid for the animal's treatment, and that ""luckily, everything turned out well"".
The wolf recovered from its brush with death within the day and, after being fitted with a GPS collar by researchers from the national environmental agency, was released back into the wild.
""We are so happy for the outcome of the story, and wish to thank all the participants especially these men who rescued the wolf and the doctors of the clinic who were not afraid to treat and nurture the wild animal,"" EUPA said.
Estonia is home to hundreds of wolves, only a handful of which have been collared in recent year. As a species, they usually avoid humans.

The Atlantic wrote about a subsequent mission that ended prematurely, demonstrating the dangers that humans face in surviving on another planet, even when they’re still on this one.” Since a boys’ soccer team became trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand on June 23, a sprawling rescue effort has captured the world’s attention. The effort is the latest chapter in the annals of cave rescues. A cave rescue in Germany in 2014. Credit Bergwacht Bayern, via Getty Images The sport of caving was first developed in the late 19th century, and its popularity grew partly as a result of explorations by Édouard-Alfred Martel, a caving pioneer from France. The first clubs were formed in England in the 1920s and ’30s. Comprehensive data on worldwide cave rescues since then is scarce. But one study found that there were 1,356 documented cases of “cavers requiring rescue” in the U.S. from 1980 to 2008. And the Cave Rescue Organization, the oldest cave-rescue group in Britain, says it has responded to 2,927 episodes since its founding in 1935. Of those, 745 were in caves; the rest were on mountains and in disused mines or other locations.","Scott Pruitt, who resigned as head of the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday, could not overcome questions about his alleged spending abuses, first-class travel and cozy relationships with lobbyists.",2018-07-06T10:02:00Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Trade War, Thailand, World Cup: Your Friday Briefing",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/briefing/trade-war-thailand-world-cup.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/06/world/06USBriefing-amcore/06USBriefing-pruitt-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,rescue,1

Mark Kaufman,"When elephants fall into deep holes, they often get trapped. Unfortunately, in drought-ridden Kenya, nomadic ranchers frequently have to dig deep holes to find water for both themselves and their livestock. And at night, thirsty elephants seek out these wells. The adults, with great long trunks, have little problem reaching the water, but the junior, inexperienced elephants can tumble in. If the animals can't be pulled out, the elephants are forced to abandon their young. SEE ALSO: Rhino experts aren’t banking on unproven IVF technology to rescue threatened species Over a dozen of these abandoned elephants now live at the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary, being taken on daily walks into the woods and fed milk with bottles. It's a unique form of conservation, where the local Samburu people — a semi-nomadic pastoralist group — collectively owns, manages, and profits from tourists that visit the 3,400-acre property. Caring for the young elephants — who grow to be the largest land animals on Earth — is a dramatic departure for the Samburu, who once feared the giant, intelligent animals. ""A typical Samburu has never been close to the elephants,"" Sammy Lemoonga, the Harvard-educated head of the sanctuary who was raised as a nomadic rancher, said in an interview. Historically, the Samburu stayed away from the elephants to avoid conflict. People and elephants have a long history that includes people killing elephants, and sometimes, elephants trampling people, Lemoonga said. Conservation International, an environmental organization that promotes biodiversity, has captured footage of the Samburu raising orphaned elephants, thirsty elephants seeking out well water, and a lone African lioness capturing a wildebeest outside the sanctuary. A short-documentary called My Africa, released Monday and narrated by Academy Award-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o, along with a virtual reality experience, illustrates the sanctuary's unexpected conservation story. Rescuing elephants may turn out to be profitable for the Samburu. Presently, the eco-tourism industry in Kenya is doing quite well, Richard Vigne, director of the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya where the last male northern white rhino recently succumbed to old age and illness, said in an interview. Many wildlife conservancies, like Ol Pejeta, rely heavily on tourism to sustain themselves — and protect their wildlife. There is already a well-established orphan elephant program in Kenya, the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, which has reintroduced some 200 elephants back into the wild, showing it can be done. Vigne said if the two-year-old Reteti Elephant Sanctuary can successfully prepare abandoned elephants for the wild — while also generating money for conservation — it could prove to be a positive endeavor. It's also likely that more baby elephants will be abandoned in the area, and the culprit is severe drought. ""The majority of elephant and human-wildlife conflict happens when there’s a drought,"" said Lemoonga, referring to the elephants seeking deep holes, dug to find water during severe droughts. Although a deluge of rain hit Kenya in April, the country has been mired in a drought for around four years. In February 2017, the Kenyan government declared a national drought emergency. Generally, elephants in this part of Kenya aren't poached for their tusks, Lemoonga said, because people have a livelihood in ranching. Of the 14 orphaned elephants at the sanctuary, 13 were orphaned after falling into the primitive wells, not because their mothers were killed. Extreme droughts are likely to be a continuing story in Kenya, and the greater Horn of Africa. ""What we’ve seen for the past several decades is a decline in rainfall especially during the longer rainy season,"" Jessica Tierney, associate professor in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Arizona, said in an interview. Tierney published a study on past and future rainfall in the region in 2015. ""In fact, that decline has been more severe than at any time in the last 1,000 years,"" she said. ""So, that raises some concern in terms of what the future holds for rainfall in the Horn of Africa."" The Samburu are preparing for more abandoned elephants, whether they're rescued from wells or left alone after poachers kill their mothers. The Samburu are also building more housing for guests, which at $800 a night per bed, ""brings in plenty of money,"" said Lemoonga. Samburu keepers bottle-feeding rescued elephants. Image: Ami Vitale This doesn't just support elephants, which are fed milk infused with vitamins and other nutrients. It also supports the Samburu themselves with medical care, scholarships, and infrastructure. Although the elephants are an attractive eco-tourism opportunity, the Samburu won't keep the animals. They've developed a plan to ""rewild"" the elephants, Lemoonga said. At age four or five, they will be permanently brought out of their stables and brought to a rewilding site in the sanctuary, where they'll be weaned off their bottles and increasingly made to rely upon natural vegetation. The young elephants are already walked through their natural environs each day and fed some natural food, in preparation for their future release. At the Samburu sanctuary, wild African animals that happen to pass through — giraffes, bison, and elephants — all realize they're safe, even though there's no fence or boundaries distinguishing the true wilderness from the sanctuary, said Lemoonga. ""When you see wild elephants in the sanctuary they're very calm and friendly,"" he said. ""Same with the giraffes."" This is a new experience for both the elephants and the Samburu people, two groups who once actively avoided each other. Today, as water becomes increasingly scarce, they may come to depend on one another ever more.","When elephants fall into deep holes, they often get trapped.

CHRISTINE HAUSER,"Mr. Crouch engaged the cornice. It snapped. He fell out of sight. “Avalanche, avalanche!” shouted Cam Fitzpatrick, a fellow snowboarder, who had been standing nearer to Mr. Crouch than the others. The group swung into action, setting off a mountainside rescue that had to be accomplished within minutes to beat the odds of death from trauma or suffocation. Mr. Crouch did not die. He was released on Friday from Vancouver General Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia, after being treated for broken vertebrae, a torn pancreas and other injuries. Nature had just taught him that extreme sports can quickly turn from thrill to peril. Mr. Crouch said on Instagram that the cornice “pulled me backward into a slide.” “It took me through about 1,000 feet and over several rock bands before I ended up at the bottom, buried with no oxygen for almost 5 minutes,” he wrote, thanking the group for saving him. The online community of board sports, both snow and surf, showed camaraderie. “Pray for Gold Medal U.S.A. Surf Team member and professional snowboarder, Brock Crouch!” U.S.A. Surfing, the sports governing body, wrote. Mr. Crouch, who has also competed in International Ski Federation snowboard events, and the others were in the Pemberton Ice Cap region of British Columbia to work with Absinthe Films, which makes snowboarding films. Weeks before they arrived, there had been an avalanche with a fatality in the region, and on Friday Shin Campos, a safety coordinator with Whistler Creek Productions in Canada, which was working with the group, said the group was aware. He said they carefully assessed the risks, such as taking into account temperature and winds, which can whip up snow and move it around to create destabilized patches that have not bonded. Photo The mountain in the Whistler backcountry area of Canada on April 22, where Brock Crouch, a snowboarder, was swept off the ridge in an avalanche. Credit John Jackson The group surveyed the mountains from a helicopter, chose their routes and then set down the aircraft to plan descents. “Most people look at these guys and say, ‘They just hike up and snowboard down,” he said. “It is much more involved.” John Jackson, 34, a professional backcountry rider from Nevada, said the group had airbags, shovels and other equipment. When Mr. Crouch dropped out of sight, they switched their radios to search mode. Mr. Campos flagged the pilot, who started up the helicopter. The riders knew they had to give chase, but first they had to navigate a safe route, cutting across debris and other hazards without putting themselves in danger or dropping more snow on the area where Mr. Crouch might be buried. With the help of the pilot, they maneuvered to the bottom where the avalanche had stalled, hoping Mr. Crouch had ended up that far. “When we were going down, in the back of our mind you are thinking, ‘Wow, we might be pulling out our dead friend,’” Mr. Jackson said. The pilot spied something in the mound — the tip of a snowboard. Hopes rose, but avalanches are so violent that they can rip away equipment — a glove, a pole, a backpack. It was around 2:15 p.m. The temperature, at 6,500 feet above sea level, was about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, as Mr. Jackson recalled. The men started to dig through packed snow. Within minutes, Mr. Jackson said, they exposed a boot, and then tried to gauge where Mr. Crouch’s head might be. As the snow was cleared, he was found folded up, his head near his feet, Mr. Jackson said. “He was taco’ed,” he said. “Because he was not directly upside down, his head was only two feet under the snow.” The bluish tint vanished from his face as they cleared snow from his airway. He moaned. They extracted his body, supporting his neck and back. Mr. Crouch was responsive, biting Mr. Jackson’s fingers. He had been buried for about five minutes. He had told his friends of trying to create an air pocket with his arms. “That is incredibly rare you have this success story,” Mr. Campos said. “The chance of survival goes down rapidly after two minutes.” In the hospital, Mr. Crouch shared photographs of his battered face. “I love snowboarding more today than I ever have and I can’t wait to get back on my board and shred with everyone again!” he wrote.

SEE ALSO: Real-life 'Spider-Man' who climbed building to save child to meet with French president The child was rescued by 22-year-old Mamoudou Gassama, an undocumented Malian migrant. In the now-famous feat, Gassama scaled several stories, earning him the ""Spiderman"" nickname, to save the child. But it turns out the child's father is now in very hot water over what he was doing at the time of the rescue. French prosecutor Francois Molins told a CNN affiliate that the father had gone grocery shopping, leaving the child alone and then proceeded to play Pokémon Go after leaving the shop. (The child's mother was away on a trip visiting family at the time.) The father has been charged with ""failure to meet parental obligations"" and could face up to two years in prison if found guilty at trial, which is currently scheduled for September. According to Molins, the father is ""devastated"" by what's transpired. Gassama, for his part, met with French President Emanuel Macron who said he would make Gassama a full French citizen. In an Instagram post showing him meeting Gassama on Monday, Macron said: With Mr Gassama who saved a child’s life on Saturday by climbing 4 floors with his bare hands. I told him that in recognition of his heroic act he would have his papers in order as quickly as possible and that the Paris fire brigade would be keen to welcome him to their ranks. I also invited him to submit a naturalization request because France is built on desire and Mr Gassama’s commitment clearly showed that he has that desire!

Dakota, aka Loppy the dog, was playing with her dog walker at a park in Brooklyn on Friday when the pooch managed to escape.

SEE ALSO: How this startup is trying to bring dog toys into the 21st century ""It’s a familiar place for her, we commute together every day.

""An MTA officer took it upon herself to explore the tracks several stations away. And, against all odds, she found Loppy."" Francis says the pup was bloodied, cold, dirty, and terrified, but miraculously OK. ""The joy I felt when the police officer showed me a photo and said 'is this her?' was all-consuming,"" she wrote. ""Being reunited with this little creature is something more powerful than I can explain."" The dog suffered some lung damage, lost a few teeth, and fractured her jaw, according to the New York Daily News. She is currently being treated at Pearl Blue hospital, but is expected to make a speedy recovery. MTA Supervisor Sanya Hill, who found the pup about a mile away from where she entered the subway, says she spotted Loppy curled up at the back of the subway platform. “I had my flashlight out and I was looking and then I saw the dog,” Hill told the News. “I didn't want her to bite me, I didn't want to scare her any more than she was. She was already shaking and already curled up all the way to the back of the platform.” 'They saved my best friend.'

Marcus Gilmer,"Incredible videos shared on Twitter are showing the wild rough seas that have led to the evacuation of 1,300 people from a cruise ship off the coast of Norway. 
The ship, Viking Cruise's ""Viking Sky,"" sent a distress signal Saturday afternoon local time, reporting ""engine problems in bad weather,"" according to CNN. And videos from both inside the cruise ship and from the shore show how bad the seas are. 
The BBC reports that at least one of the ship's engines was successfully restarted, enabling the Viking Sky to move a bit further from the rocky shore. Not surprisingly, the BBC also notes, ""The area is known as the Hustadvika and is reportedly one of the most dangerous stretches of Norway's coast.""
SEE ALSO: El Niño has arrived. What does that mean for weather in 2019?
Multiple ships and helicopters are taking part in the evacuation; the Joint Rescue Centre for Southern Norway shared video of the rescue to YouTube.
To complicate matters, a cargo ship with nine people on board hit the same rough waters as the Viking Sky and some of the rescue helicopters had to be diverted for assistance.
A member of the rescue crew told Reuters that eight people had suffered minor injuries and that the rescue attempt will take a while, continuing into the night and maybe even into Sunday. Photos of passengers waiting for their turn at evacuation also hit social media. 
Mashable reached out to Viking Cruises for a statement and updates on the ongoing rescue and received the following message in response:
We can confirm that on March 23rd at 2pm (Norwegian time) the vessel Viking Sky a 47,800 tonne ship travelling from Tromsø to Stavanger, carrying 915 guests and 458 crew experienced a loss of engine power off the coast of Norway near Molde. We are working closely with the relevant authorities and all operational procedures were followed in line with international regulations. In addition Viking has dispatched an operational task force, including the companys owner, to Molde.
Our first priority was for the safety and wellbeing of our passengers and our crew, and in close cooperation with the Norwegian Coast Guard, the captain decided to evacuate all guests from the vessel by helicopter. The ship is proceeding on its own power and a tugboat is on site. The evacuation is proceeding with all necessary caution. A small number of non-life threatening injuries have been reported. Guests are being accommodated in local hotels when they arrive back on shore, and Viking will arrange for return flights for all guests.
The statement also added that anyone with questions or concerns about specific guests aboard the Viking Sky can find more information right here.","Incredible videos shared on Twitter are showing the wild rough seas that have led to the evacuation of 1,300 people from a cruise ship off the coast of Norway.

"Susannah Cullinane, CNN","(CNN)It was Kimberly Sue Endicott's dream to go on an excursion to see gorillas in their natural habitat.
That dream seemed to become a nightmare last week when the California woman and her tour guide were kidnapped at gunpoint in a Ugandan national park, taken by gunmen who later used their hostages' cell phones to issue ransom demands.
But the nightmare ended Sunday when Ugandan security forces rescued Endicott and her guide. They were freed unharmed from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which borders the Queen Elizabeth National Park -- the scene of their abduction during a game-watching drive Tuesday evening.
Four other people taken at the same time were previously released, officials said.
Endicott is from Orange County and lives in Costa Mesa, working as a esthetician there, CNN affiliate KABC reported Thursday.
Endicott's friends told KABC that she had been enthusiastic about her trip to Uganda. One -- neighbor Pascale Douglas -- said news that hearing her friend had been abducted was like a ""punch to the gut.""
""She had mentioned when I met her one of her big dreams was to go see the gorillas,"" Douglas told KABC. ""At the time she asked me if it was something I would consider doing also, but time went by and she ended up going on her trip."" 
Armed gang demanded a ransom
Ugandan police said Thursday that an armed gang had kidnapped Endicott and her guide, and made frequent demands for a ransom of $500,000 using their victims' cell phones. Police had said they would not offer the money. 
Ugandan security forces eventually rescued Endicott and her guide, although officials were vague on releasing details.
""Both were rescued from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are safely back in Kanungu district in Uganda,"" government spokesperson Ofwono Opondo said Sunday. ""They are back at the lodge and she is expected to be in Kampala tomorrow.""
Opondo said the kidnappers fled the scene of the rescue when law enforcement officers and soldiers moved in, disappearing as they had done earlier when they took the hostages. 
A US defense official told CNN that the US military had provided support to Ugandan security forces. The support included intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets and liaison officers, the official said.
'A quiet and peaceful' handover
A ransom was paid to free Endicott and her guide, a source with knowledge of the exchange told CNN on Sunday. The handover was ""quiet and peaceful,"" the source said. 
Wild Frontiers said neither Endicott nor her tour guide were harmed. A spokesperson for the company said the identities of the alleged kidnappers have not been revealed. 
President Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon that he was ""pleased to report"" the two have been released. 
""God bless them and their families,"" Trump said on Twitter. 
The State Department said it was aware of the rescue. 
""We are aware of reports that a US citizen hostage was recovered on April 7 by Ugandan security officials,"" a State Department spokesperson told CNN. ""Privacy considerations prevent us from commenting further at this time.""

Little Holland fell into the hands of the Trio Animal Foundation in Chicago for urgent medical care after she endured uninhabitable conditions at a ""open access"" shelter that only accepted abandoned animals. According to TAF's Facebook post, once the canine arrived, her fur was completely matted and covered her entire body.

I find the videos mesmerizing and love what you can learn along the way. There are loads of tips and tricks in these vids. One thing I’m surprised about is how many of the old, ratty, and rusty motors in these machines can be brought back to life with little more than a cleaning, some TLC, and maybe some new brushes.

MIKE IVES and MUKTITA SUHARTONO,"The landslide occurred in the Bolaang Mongondow area of North Sulawesi. Officials there have said the search and rescue effort is scheduled to last until Monday.
After the accident, officials said they could hear voices of some of those trapped inside makeshift mine shafts through gaps in the mud. But Abdul Muin Paputungan, an official overseeing the rescue operation, later told The Associated Press that signs of life had faded after four days.
But we still try to save them even though at the moment it seems like a miracle if they can survive, he said over the weekend.
Mr. Latif of the search and rescue agency said on Tuesday that rescuers had been unable to hear any trapped miners in recent days, even with radar equipment that can detect noises up to nearly 200 feet underground.
Typically, if someone strikes gold in Indonesia, other miners show up in the area and start digging their own holes nearby. If a landslide covers several holes, the authorities may not know where to search or even how many holes there are.
Officials say the rescue effort in North Sulawesi has been particularly challenging because earlier digging by miners at the site has rendered its steep slopes unstable.","After a week of searching, rescuers still don’t know how many people are trapped in a collapsed mine, or even how many makeshift holes have been dug by the miners.",2019-03-05T08:11:24Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Death Toll From Indonesia Landslide Climbs to 17,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/world/asia/indonesia-landslide-mine.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/05/world/05indonesia-mine/05indonesia-mine-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,rescue,1

Gus Hutt, a holiday camper staying on Matata Beach on North Island, was fishing when he spotted a small figure floating in the water. He first thought it was a doll and only realised it was a baby after he ""let out a little squeak"". The boy had escaped from his parents' tent and ended up in the ocean. ""I thought he was a doll. [Even as] I reached out and grabbed him by the arm, I still thought it was a doll,"" Mr Hutt told local outlet the NZ Herald. ""His face looked just like porcelain with his short hair wetted down, but then he let out a little squeak and I thought 'oh God this is a baby and it's alive'."" Mr Hutt, who was staying at Murphy's Holiday Camp located in the coastal town of Matata, was out on a nearby beach on 26 October at about 06:15 New Zealand time (17:15GMT). According to the Herald, Mr Hutt would usually head straight from the camp to fish on the beach, but decided on that day to fish at a different spot - 100m to the left. After checking his fishing lines, he spotted the boy floating in the water. ""He was floating at a steady pace...if I had been just a minute later I wouldn't have seen him,"" Mr Hutt said. ""He was bloody lucky, but he just wasn't meant to go, it wasn't his time."" Mr Hutt's wife, Sue, alerted the camp's staff who informed them that there was only one couple staying with a baby. Emergency services were also alerted. ""Apparently the baby had been very excited to be on the beach. It was the couple's first night staying here. It's the first time they've been here,"" Rebecca Salter, the co-owner of Murphy's Holiday Camp told the BBC. ""Hutt, who is a fisherman and one of our regulars, spotted the baby. [They brought the baby to us], we wrapped him up in towels and Sue went to inform the baby's parents."" The baby had escaped from his parents' tent by undoing the zipper, and then made his way into the ocean. The baby's mother ""screamed"" when she was informed that her baby was found in the water - the couple later thanked the Hutts before returning home. ""It came as a shock to everyone. It was a very, very lucky result... it could have been a very tragic incident,"" said Mrs Salter. ""It's a freakish miracle."" Whakatane Police confirmed to the BBC that they attended to the emergency, adding that the baby was now ""okay"".",The 18-month-old boy had escaped from his parents' tent by undoing the zipper and ended up in the water.,2018-11-05T07:07:04Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",New Zealand baby rescue: Fisherman pulls 18-month baby from ocean,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46093938,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1A47/production/_104172760_gettyimages-1018477478.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,rescue,1
EMMA G. FITZSIMMONS,"Later Thursday, Mr. Cuomo’s office released a new statement in response to questions about whether the governor supported Mr. Byford and his plan. Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, offered support for Mr. Byford — and a list of other top executives at the authority. “The governor looks forward to reviewing the report and supporting the M.T.A.’s new management team in their effort to overhaul and modernize NYC Transit and bring relief to riders,” she said. “Andy Byford, Joe Lhota, Pat Foye, Ronnie Hakim, Phil Eng and Janno Lieber are changing the M.T.A. and that’s why they’re there.” Technically, Mr. Byford was hired by leaders at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state-controlled agency that oversees the subway. But Mr. Cuomo, who has taken a close role in setting the agency’s priorities, interviewed Mr. Byford in person and essentially signed off on him. In the past, Mr. Cuomo has praised Mr. Byford in public, though Mr. Cuomo has also pressed him to focus on a new signal technology that has not been used on any major transit system. Mr. Byford’s plan relies on a proven technology that has already been thoroughly tested in New York. The authority’s chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, says Mr. Cuomo is simply trying to keep pressure on the agency to become more efficient. Mr. Lhota views his role as helping to protect Mr. Byford from the difficult politics surrounding the agency so that Mr. Byford can focus on running the system. But the plan’s release was quickly overshadowed by political squabbling between Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, and criticism from the actress Cynthia Nixon, who is running for governor in the Democratic primary. On Thursday, Ms. Nixon said Mr. Byford’s plan is exactly what the subway needed. “The question is, will the governor listen to the study that he himself has ordered?” Ms. Nixon said. A day earlier, Mr. Cuomo had told reporters the plan could not succeed without Mr. de Blasio pitching in some cash. Mr. de Blasio said that fixing the subway was Mr. Cuomo’s problem because he ran it. An M.T.A. spokesman hit back, saying the city owned the subway and the mayor’s unwillingness to help pay for the plan had made it “dead on arrival.”","Andy Byford, the president of New York City Transit, which runs the buses and subway, will have to sell his multibillion dollar plan to rescue the subway to elected leaders, including Gov.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption There were cheers and applause as the first boys' rescue was confirmed Cave divers in Thailand are poised to restart the high-risk operation to extract the remaining eight boys and their football coach from a vast flooded cave system. Four boys were brought safely out of the cave on Sunday. But the mission was paused overnight for air tanks to be replaced. Rescuers decided to go ahead with the hazardous operation because of fears of rising waters. The group have been trapped since 23 June. The next phase of the mission to save them was set to begin Monday morning, after relaying ""all of the air tanks and all systems along the way"", Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said on Sunday. Divers have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. They have reportedly been able to make the last part of the journey on foot. Media caption Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" Rescuers took advantage of a break in the rain to launch the mission much earlier than originally expected. The first phase has also been conducted much faster than officials had predicted. How are the boys being moved? A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. Image copyright EPA Image caption An ambulance arrives at a nearby hospital after leaving the cave site Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. The toughest part is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be, a former Thai navy diver died in the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. He lost consciousness and could not be revived. His colleagues said they would ""not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". Sense of remaining unease BBC's Nick Beake at the scene This is a hugely high-profile rescue attempt and Thailand knows the world is watching. It has embarked on a dangerous option but believes it's the best for bringing the group out alive. It has assembled a team of internationally renowned divers and so far their expertise has brought four boys - thought to be the weakest - back to their families. But the relief of those mums and dads will be tempered by the knowledge that nine other families face an anxious wait for the turn of their loved ones to be shepherded through the narrow and murky corridors of the Tham Luang cave complex. As one diving expert put it to me, when underwater cave rescues go wrong they go wrong in a big way. So despite this promising start, there is a sense of unease here in Chiang Mai. But the overriding impression from the rescuers is a clear focus and unshakable resolve to finish the job. Who are the boys and their coach? Chanin Vibulrungruang, 11 (Nickname: Titan) - started playing football aged seven Panumas Sangdee, 13 (Nickname: Mig), wrote to his parents: ""The Navy Seals are taking good care of me"" Duganpet Promtep, 13 (Nickname: Dom) - captain of the Wild Boars, reportedly scouted by several Thai professional clubs Somepong Jaiwong, 13 (nickname: Pong) - reportedly dreams of playing for the Thai national team Mongkol Booneiam, 13 (nickname: Mark) - described by his teacher as a ""very respectful and good child"" Nattawut Takamrong, 14 (nickname: Tern) - told his parents not to worry about him Ekarat Wongsukchan, 14 (nickname: Bew) - promised his mother he would help her at the shop once he was rescued Adul Sam-on, 14 - member of a volleyball team that came second in a North Thailand-wide tournament Prajak Sutham, 15 (nickname: Note) - described by family friends as a ""smart, quiet guy"" Pipat Pho, 15 (nickname: Nick) - wrote in his letter he wanted his parents to take him for barbecued food once rescued Pornchai Kamluang, 16 (nickname: Tee) - told his parents ""don't worry, I'm very happy"" Peerapat Sompiangjai, 17 (nickname: Night) - it was his birthday the day the boys went missing, and his parents have told him they are still waiting to hold his birthday party Assistant coach Ekapol Chantawong (nickname Ake), 25 - apologised in his letter to the parents, but they replied that they did not blame him How did the group get there? The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers on Monday, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. Aged between 11 and 17, they belong to a football club called the Wild Boars, and became trapped during an excursion with their coach. It took nine days to find them in the underground network's dark depths. Race against the rain Officials had originally thought the group might have to stay where they were until the rainy season ended - and that could have meant months underground. They had also been exploring whether they could drill down into the cave, as well as scouring the mountainside for another way in. But with the rainy season just beginning, it has become clear that the flooding which originally trapped the boys will only get worse in the coming days.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Divers are preparing to resume a high-risk rescue operation to free the last five members of a group who became trapped in a vast cave system in northern Thailand last month. The health of the four boys and their football coach is said to be good as they ready to be guided through the narrow flooded passages of the complex. Eight boys have been brought out of the caves over the past two days. The operation inside the Tham Luang caves has attracted global attention. The group became trapped on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding. They were found last week by divers. How are the rescued boys? The eight boys have not been seen in public, but have been pronounced to be in reasonable health. The four who came out on Monday were stretchered from the caves and taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Chiang Rai. The first group of four boys, who were rescued on Sunday, are being kept in quarantine in hospital and have yet to be reunited with their parents. The Thai authorities say the rescued boys are able to eat rice porridge, although their request for a favourite pork dish has been turned down until their digestive systems recover from 10 days without food. 'Success against the odds' By Dan Johnson, Tham Luang caves It's going like clockwork. The ambulances driving slowly away from the cave entrance with their lights flashing show that another boy has been saved. There's a buzz around each one and the optimism grows. Word seems to spread from different sources but the Thai Navy Seals Facebook page gives the official updates. This is a careful, delicate operation fraught with risk. But this rescue plan - daring, dangerous and complicated - is working. It's delivering success, against such difficult odds. Relief is starting to break the tension that's built over more than two weeks. There's been another pause here overnight. Nobody wants to rush. There's admiration for the dive team's dedication, their skill and experience. They've risen to this challenge. But four of the boys, and their football coach, are underground for a 17th night. On Tuesday we'll all hold our breath once more, in the hope of seeing them emerge. How are they being rescued? A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system.

His colleagues said they would ""not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". The rescue mission chief said the second day of the operation had gone more smoothly than the first, taking two hours less as the procedure became more refined. A massive pumping operation is said to have helped lower the water level inside the cave system, making the journey in and out easier than it was. Who are the boys and their coach? Some details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. Captain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-born Adul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-old Peerapat Sompiangjai 's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave. The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coach Ekapol Chantawong, 25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys. How did the group get there? The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers a week ago, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit the eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday is confirmed to have killed hundreds of people, the New York Times reported on Saturday, with at least 405 confirmed deaths in the city of Palu and the toll likely to rise much higher as search-and-rescue teams continue to arrive. Hundreds more are injured. The Times reported that the disaster leveled large swathes of the city in addition to nearby coastal communities, with thousands of structures destroyed. The precise number of dead may be difficult to determine, the paper added, as there were workers and security personnel present as preparations were underway for a beachside festival with dances and other performances, as well a high likelihood the tsunami pulled many people back into the ocean: The twin disasters a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, and the swirling wall of water it unleashed killed at least 405 people in Palu and destroyed thousands of buildings there, including a shopping mall, a hotel, seaside restaurants and several mosques. We have found corpses from the earthquake as well as bodies swept up by the tsunami, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, said in a television interview. Indonesian officials were preparing for a sharp rise in the death toll because search-and-rescue teams had yet to reach populous coastal settlements near Palu. Vice President Jusuf Kalla of Indonesia told a local news website that thousands may have died, with an unknown number washed out to sea. Kalla added that when the infamous Indian Ocean tsunami struck Aceh in northern Sumatra in 2004, a death toll initially indicated at 40 people eventually rose to over over 130,000 (estimates suggest at least 230,000 people died as a result of the disaster in total across 14 countries). Palu, a city of 300,000, may have also been particularly hard struck because emergency alert systems that could have warned of the tsunami were rendered useless by collapsing cell towers during the earthquake, the Times wrote. Indonesias meteorological and physics agency also lifted its own tsunami advisory little more than half an hour after the earthquake struck, though it has not yet been determined whether the waves were already hitting the coast by the time it chose to do so. The Washington Post reported that the nations emergency officials are investigating why many members of the public did not seem to have been properly alerted about the risk of the wave: Indonesian officials also may face another reckoning over why the tsunami alerts were pulled even as a disaster was roaring ashore, raising questions about the level of monitoring and post-quake analysis in a nation along some of the worlds most active fault lines. People were still going about their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesias National Disaster Management Agency, who said that hundreds were gathered in Palu for a beach party. The number of deaths, he said, will continue to rise as the search continues. The emergency response is being hindered by damaged or destroyed roads, ports, and communications lines, the Post added, as well as the number of personnel still deployed to the island of Lombok following another devastating 6.9-magnitude earthquake that killed over 450 in August. A 21-year-old air traffic controller at a regional airport, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, stayed at his post as other personnel evacuated, ensuring the takeoff of Batik Air Flight 6231. According to the Post, the plane had hundreds on board; the air traffic controller jumped from the tower to his death as its roof collapsed, while the pilot (identified by the Times as Ricosetta Mafella) posted a short video of the oncoming wave to Instagram. Thank God there is a voice (Holy Spirit i believe) telling me to depart early, he wrote. Im rushing the boarding process. Late by 30 second i would not have flown. Though Indonesia is in the Ring of Firea roughly 25,000-mile chain of volcanoes and other tectonic hot spots that stretches across the Pacific Ocean and plays host to 90 percent of the worlds earthquakes National Geographic reported that the tsunami was unexpected at this quake. It was recorded as the result of a strike-slip fault, during which tectonic plates grind against each other horizontally rather than vertically. Vertical displacement is more likely to cause a tsunami than horizontal movement of a fault. According to National Geographic, University of Oxford geophysicist Baptiste Gombert said that the regions geology is incredibly complex but initial signs are that landslides either above or below the water line played a role. Its also possible the waves were amplified by the shape of the bay as the tsunami forced water into the restricted space. Indonesias central statistics agency estimates that around 2.4 million people could be impacted by the disaster, according to the Times.

CHRIS STANFORD,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump’s claim on Monday that he has “the absolute right” to pardon himself for any crime was the latest in a series of moves asserting his control over federal law enforcement. No president has ever pardoned himself, and it’s unclear if Mr. Trump could legitimately do so. The idea that presidents, by virtue of their unique constitutional powers, are above the law has surfaced before. Richard Nixon famously claimed after Watergate, “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” But assertions by Mr. Trump’s team that obstruction-of-justice statutes do not apply to him carry new twists. Read more from one of our Washington correspondents. Also on Monday, prosecutors accused Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, of trying to tamper with witnesses in his tax and money laundering case.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Entire towns have become tombs of ash following Volcan de Fuego’s eruption earlier this week. Rescue and cleanup efforts have continued, but rain is in the forecast and could hamper them as it turns ash into viscous sludge. And the scenes being captured by aerial photos look straight out of the upside down. Volcan de Fuego is no stranger to eruptions as one of Latin America’s most active volcanoes, but Sunday’s violent outburst was more extreme than its usual pyrotechnics. The eruption sent ash streaming into the sky before tumbling down its flanks in a superheated highway of destruction, which volcanologists call a pyroclastic flow. At least 99 are dead according to the latest death toll, and 12,000 have evacuated to safety as the volcano continues to rumble. A smaller pyroclastic flow tore down the mountain’s south flank on Tuesday and prompted the closure of a highway in the vicinity according to the AP, though it wasn’t as destructive as Sunday’s big one. Local residents also told AP that villages in the shadow of the volcano were covered in up to three meters (10 feet) of ash. Meanwhile, aerial photos have revealed that the trees, fields, houses, and stores that typically create a vibrant landscape of bright greens, pinks, and yellows have turned a ghostly gray. 1 / 5 Bulldozers are working in some areas to clear the ash and rescue efforts are continuing despite the increasingly slim odds of survivors being found. In other locations, the ash remains too hot to navigate. Rain will only bring additional challenges. The country’s rainy season started in May, and so far it’s been fairly wet. Guatemala’s national meteorological service warned that rainfall this week would fall on already saturated soils and could lead to floods and mudslides, hazards that are normally bad enough. But forecasters also warned about lahars, a slurry of volcanic debris and water that can choke streams and waterways. Ash also absorbs a huge amount of water. A cubic meter of dry ash can weigh between 500-1,500 kilograms (1,100-3,300 lbs.) but that weight balloons to 1,000-2,000 kilograms (2,200-4,400 lbs.) once it gets wet, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. That’s hugely problematic for cleanup, which is itself hugely problematic for the thousands of people stuck in limbo.","Entire towns have become tombs of ash following Volcan de Fuego’s eruption earlier this week.

 Benjamín Sánchez: ""I was really happy when I saw my mum""
A five-year-old boy who was rescued after almost 24 hours lost in the desert in western Argentina has been released from hospital.
Benjamín Sánchez went missing during a family trip on Sunday and was found by a team of volunteers 21km (13 miles) from where he was last seen.
""I was cold, I slept badly, leaning on a rock,"" said the boy, who was wearing only a T-shirt and light trousers.
He said he had survived by eating grass and drinking water from a stream.
After being rescued on Monday afternoon, the child was taken by helicopter to a hospital in San Juan suffering slight dehydration and was released on Tuesday.
'I got scared'
Benjamín was found sitting under a tree by a motorcyclist after a search operation that involved some 1,000 police, civil defence officials and volunteers.
""My mum was chasing me and I started running. At first I could hear her but then I got lost,"" he told El Clarín newspaper (in Spanish).

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"On Tuesday, the remaining five boys were rescued from the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex where 12 members of a soccer team and their coach were trapped for more than two weeks. The rescue mission spanned three days, and, according to new details, involved drugging the boys prior to the extraction. The news comes from former Thailand Navy SEAL Chaiyananta Peeranarong, who told AFP on Wednesday that the boys were asleep or semi-awake during the rescue mission. “Some of them were asleep, some of them were wiggling their fingers... (as if) groggy, but they were breathing,” Commander Peeranarong, who helped transfer the boys through the cave, said. Junta leader Prayut Chan-O-Cha reported yesterday that the boys were given a “minor tranquilizer,” which a BBC report characterized as an anti-anxiety medication used by soldiers. “When we take this, we can be more focused and increase the chance of sharpshooting,” Chan-ocha said. BBC confirmed Wednesday that they were “heavily sedated” to prevent anxiety during the excavation. The first footage of the mission shows boys wrapped up and strapped to stretchers as divers transfer them through the cave’s narrow passageways using a pulley system. Many of the boys, who were all part of the Wild Boars soccer team, didn’t know how to swim and didn’t have any diving experience. Each boy was assigned two divers, a bodysuit, and a full face mask. “This is the hardest mission we’ve ever done,” Thai rescue diver Narongsuk Keasub told CNN. “The lower the water is getting, the stronger the current. It’s stronger now. Every step of the extraction is risky. We can only see our hands [at a] short distance. Secondly, the stones are razor sharp which is dangerous for our diving, [and] thirdly the passage is very narrow.” The success of the excavation was a huge relief, given the boys and their soccer coach had been trapped since June 23, surviving for nine days before being discovered alive by drinking water from the walls of the cave, according to officials, BBC reported. And while the rescue mission was largely successful, it was not absent of opportunists. Hollywood producers hung around the cave complex in northern Thailand drumming up inspiration for a future blockbuster, while a tech billionaire promoted and delivered his mini-submarine that the rescue chief deemed “ not practical.”","On Tuesday, the remaining five boys were rescued from the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex where 12 members of a soccer team and their coach were trapped for more than two weeks.

Kate Conger,"Google is committing to not using artificial intelligence for weapons or surveillance after employees protested the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program that uses artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage. However, Google says it will continue to work with the United States military on cybersecurity, search and rescue, and other non-offensive projects. Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the change in a set of AI principles released today. The principles are intended to govern Google’s use of artificial intelligence and are a response to employee pressure on the company to create guidelines for its use of AI. Employees at the company have spent months protesting Google’s involvement in Project Maven, sending a letter to Pichai demanding that Google terminate its contract with the Department of Defense. Several employees even resigned in protest, concerned that Google was aiding the development of autonomous weapons systems. Google will focus on creating “socially beneficial” AI, Pichai said, and avoid projects that cause “overall harm.” “How AI is developed and used will have a significant impact on society for many years to come,” Pichai wrote. “These are not theoretical concepts; they are concrete standards that will actively govern our research and product development and will impact our business decisions.” The AI principles were met with mixed reactions among Google employees. Despite Google’s commitment not to use AI to build weapons, employees questioned whether the principles would explicitly prohibit Google from pursuing a government contract like Maven in the future. One Googler told Gizmodo that the principles amounted to “a hollow PR statement.” Several employees said that they did not think the principles went far enough to hold Google accountable—for instance, Google’s AI guidelines include a nod to following “principles of international law” but do not explicitly commit to following international human rights law. Another Googler who spoke with Gizmodo said that the principles were a good start, mitigating some of the risks that employees who protested Maven were concerned about. However, the AI principles do not make clear whether Google would be precluded from working on a project like Maven—which promised vast surveillance capabilities to the military but stopped short of enabling algorithmic drone strikes. Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene defended her organization’s involvement in Project Maven, suggesting that it did not have a lethal impact. “This contract involved drone video footage and low-res object identification using AI, saving lives was the overarching intent,” Greene wrote in a blog post. “We will not be pursuing follow on contracts for the Maven project, and because of that, we are now working with our customer to responsibly fulfill our obligations in a way that works long-term for them and is also consistent with our AI principles,” she added, confirming Gizmodo’s reporting last week that Google would not seek to renew its Maven contract after it expires in 2019. “On most fronts, these are well thought-out principles, and with a few caveats we’d recommend that other major tech companies set out similar guidelines and objectives for their AI work,” Peter Eckersley, chief computer scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Gizmodo. To improve upon its principles, Google should commit to independent and transparent review to ensure that its rules are properly applied, he said. Pichai’s assertions about not using AI for surveillance also left something to be desired, Eckersley added. “The company has constrained itself to only assisting AI surveillance projects that don’t violate internationally accepted norms,” Eckersley said. “It might be more comforting if Google tried to avoid building AI-assisted surveillance systems altogether.” In internal emails reviewed by Gizmodo, a Google employee working on Project Maven said that the company would attempt to provide a “Google-earth-like” surveillance system, offering “an exquisite capability” for near real-time analysis of drone footage.","Google is committing to not using artificial intelligence for weapons or surveillance after employees protested the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program that uses artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage.

Karissa Bell,"One day in the not-so-distant future, search and rescue workers could rush into disaster areas not on foot or in traditional rescue vehicles, but via a robotic avatar. At least, that's the vision behind the latest XPrize, which today announced a new competition that will award $10 million to the first team who's able to create a functional robotic avatar by 2021. SEE ALSO: All-girl team builds flame-throwing robots and takes them into battle XPrize is still hammering out the exact rules and requirements of what this will entail, but the basics are this: it has to be operational from at least 100 km away and user-friendly enough that avatars can be controlled without any specialized training. To do so, teams will need to use a number of different types of technologies: virtual reality, haptics, robotics, and artificial intelligence. (Xprize is also soliciting expert opinions for more feedback on their plans.) It's an ambitious goal, but one XPrize CEO Peter Diamandis believes is possible sooner, rather than later, thanks to advancements in the underlying technology necessary to enable such a creation. Real-life avatars could soon be a thing. Image: Reproduced with permission by Beyond Imagination, Inc. ""We're always looking for the right moment in time that would accelerate the technology and form enough teams together and really cause the seeding of these new companies,"" Diamandis says. Early applications of the technology could be used for medical professionals or search and rescue workers, but could also be used for travel and other consumer industries. (The prize's sponsor is Japanese airliner ANA, of all companies.) It's not the first time XPrize has launched a competition that sounds more like science fiction than reality. The company previously held competitions to bring a private spacecraft to the moon (all of the teams failed ) and to create a real-life version of Star Trek's tricorder (which had a winner, though there's still a ways to go before we see a consumer version). But Diamandis believes avatars are not only possible, but that as an industry they have ""the potential to be as big, or bigger than companies like Uber.""
