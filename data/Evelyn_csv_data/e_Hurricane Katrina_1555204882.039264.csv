 Michael Ertel served as Florida's secretary of state for only a few weeks
Florida's Secretary of State Michael Ertel has resigned after photos emerged of him in blackface dressed as a victim of Hurricane Katrina.
The images, printed by the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper, were allegedly taken at a Halloween party in 2005.
Mr Ertel - wearing a bandana and a shirt with ""Katrina Victim"" written on the front - was a local supervisor of elections at the time.
Hurricane Katrina killed nearly 2,000 people, many in Florida.
The secretary's of state's responsibilities include overseeing elections in Florida and promoting its economic interests around the world.
Mr Ertle was appointed in the role in December by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis.
""There's nothing I can say,"" Mr Ertel said when approached by the Tallahassee Democrat for comment about the photos.
He resigned hours after the paper shared them with the Florida governor's office. 
Mr Ertel has deleted his Twitter account and was also not available for comment.
Mr Ertel was Seminole County supervisor of elections for 14 years, winning four elections to the role.
He received numerous awards within Florida for increasing voter registration.",Michael Ertel quits his top post after pictures of him dressed as a Hurricane Katrina victim emerge.,2019-01-25T00:14:40Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Senior Florida official quits after blackface images emerge,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46995485,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11C1D/production/_105333727_5b62a47d-941a-42f7-b46d-4aacb212f6bc-ertel-1.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Hurricane Katrina,1

STEPHEN HILTNER,"To be sure, Village de l’Est is still home to a vibrant array of Vietnamese traditions, many of which revolve around three cultural pillars: religion, family and food. It’s hard to overstate the centrality of religious life. An overwhelming majority of the Vietnamese community here is Roman Catholic, and the local church, Mary Queen of Vietnam, serves the residents in ways that extend far beyond the liturgical. “All kinds of social issues come to the church, and to the pastor,” said Tony Tran, 54, a longtime parish coordinator. “Political, social, medical issues — the whole nine yards.” In its early days, he said, the church even helped to educate residents about, and translate, the state’s electrical codes. The church hosts the community’s annual Tet festival, a celebration of the Lunar New Year — an event that includes firework displays and dragon dances. The church was also instrumental in helping to begin a community development corporation, MQVN, that since 2006 has advocated a range of development programs, including those tied to health care, education, housing, social services and economic development.","Forty-three years after the fall of Saigon and almost 13 years after Hurricane Katrina, many residents wonder if their long-resilient community is nearing another — quieter — inflection point.",2018-05-05T09:00:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Surfacing: Vietnamese Forged a Community in New Orleans.

I wanted to date the Vanderbilt boy. COOPER I imagined him on a Bluetooth headset, walking around, gesticulating a lot. COHEN By the way, you weren’t exactly Mr. Personality on that call, either. COOPER No, I wasn’t. I was very depressed. It was a bleak time. I was trying to figure out my way at ABC. I started as a one-man band; a guy I worked with when I was a fact-checker made a fake press pass for me, and I borrowed a camera and started going to wars. I’d been working at Channel One for three years. I’d never worked at a network. I didn’t know what I was doing. We never had the date. COHEN We started running into each other at the Roxy. He would be dancing around. COOPER I wouldn’t be dancing around. I was like, that’s the guy who said, “your mom is Gloria Vanderbilt.” COHEN We both knew Barry Diller, and we wound up in this group that would travel together, him and his friends.

COHEN I thought he was a little standoffish. But I liked making him laugh. That was my goal: Maybe I can crack this guy up, and that’s where we can come together. COOPER He did this whole “Maniac” dance. Flashdance - She's a Maniac [HD] Video by Vientaneva COHEN Oh, yes, from “Flashdance.” We were on the boat, it’s a very fast dance, and I was barefoot. Didn’t I cut my foot? COOPER It made me giggle uncontrollably. That’s the first time I remember being like, “You’re funny.” COHEN Then we would have dinner occasionally, or be at the same party. We went to Croatia in 2005. I was at Bravo then. COOPER I started working later at night, so our chances for hanging out were limited. COHEN Our shows are so different, but we have commonalities because we’re both on every night. I worked in news —— why are you laughing? Excuse me, I worked at CBS News for 10 years. COOPER You absolutely did, but the advice you would give me was not —— I was in Croatia with him when I got the call about Hurricane Katrina. I turned to Andy and said, “I gotta go,” and, Andy, as a newsman, what was it you said? COHEN I said: “This is ridiculous. They just want you outside at some rainstorm so they can get ratings.” COOPER Needless to say, I was on the next flight out. But one of the things I don’t think Andy has gotten enough credit for is he’s been an openly gay man in this industry from the very beginning. I was out at work —— COHEN He was out to everybody. Everyone at CNN knew your partner. COOPER And I was out at the Roxy. COHEN Yeah, with your flaming-white hair, like Katniss Everdeen. COOPER It was more about not discussing it publicly. But I told you I was going to be making a statement. COHEN He never asked me for advice, but we did talk about it. COOPER I don’t think there’s anything I’ve not discussed with him. It’s nice to have someone who pokes fun at you. If I’m in a dangerous place, he’ll text me something funny.

COOPER No. COHEN He is a very fussy eater. We were in the Dallas airport two weeks ago. Tell what you were eating for breakfast. COOPER Panda Express. COHEN He was eating orange chicken at 9 a.m. It was so gross. COOPER We took a trip to Brazil five years ago. It was me; my partner, Benjamin [Maisani]; a friend of ours; and Andy. I brought them to Trancoso, this town I’d always heard about. I booked the hotels, I booked the flights — the one thing I asked Andy to do was check the bags in. COHEN I lost Anderson’s luggage.

Rachel Becker,"Climate change is already making devastating hurricanes wetter — and similar storms are likely to unleash more rain and faster winds by the end of the century, new research says. When Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria struck the US in rapid succession in the fall of 2017, the storms and their aftermaths killed thousands of people and caused an estimated $265 billion in damage. Harvey became the second costliest storm after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. Now, new research published today in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world. The study also predicts that in a warmer future, these storms would be even wetter and windier. A second paper (also published today in Nature) took a closer look at Hurricane Harvey. It shows another way people may have made the storm’s rain and flooding more severe: by building cities. Hurricanes should, theoretically, be more intense and wetter on a hotter planet. After all, warm ocean water fuels hurricanes, and warmer air holds more moisture — which means more rain. Recent studies back that up; analyses of Hurricane Harvey, for instance, reported that 15 percent or more of the rainfall could be attributed to global warming. “It’s a very important confirmation.” Today’s paper provides yet more evidence about the ways in which climate change shapes extreme weather events, says Dim Coumou, an atmospheric scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who was not involved in the study. “It’s a very important confirmation of our understanding of how hurricanes change with global warming.” Climate scientist Michael Mann says that some of the results make perfect sense. “We expect greater rainfall and flooding from hurricanes as ocean surface temperatures and atmospheric moisture content increases in a warming world.” But he cautions that the papers use a single climate model, so “it is difficult to draw other general conclusions from these studies.” The study started because Christina Patricola, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wanted to find out how exactly climate change fit into the recent spate of devastating storms. So she simulated more than a dozen hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina. She and her co-author Michael Wehner plugged in ocean temperature, atmospheric conditions, and watched the simulated storms spin toward land. The models weren’t perfect, the study acknowledges: the simulations didn’t quite capture Hurricane Maria’s track, or the rapid intensifications of Katrina, Maria, and Irma. But the models were close — and that’s where the experiments could start. Patricola tweaked the conditions to watch what would happen if Katrina, Irma, and Maria had unfolded in a pre-industrial world, and found that global warming boosted the deluge by between 4 and 9 percent. The team also analyzed wind speeds, but didn’t see much of a contribution of global warming for the recent storms. That could change in the future. Patricola found that if we continue to burn fossil fuels unchecked through the year 2100, some of those same storms would drop 25 to 30 percent more rain, and the winds would blow up to 33 miles per hour faster. It’s a thorough, convincing study, Coumou says — but there are still some big questions left to answer. The study doesn’t examine how climate change might alter the speed at which hurricanes travel along their paths, for example, or how future hurricane rainfall and storm surge might combine to drive heavy flooding. The question of flooding is where today’s second study comes in. Hydrologist Gabriele Villarini at the University of Iowa and his colleagues at Princeton University took a close look at Hurricane Harvey, which dumped five feet of rain on Houston and killed at least 93 people. Previous studies analyzed at how much of that rainfall could be attributed to global warming, and found it was around 15 precent or more. And we’d expect that when developers slap down impermeable surfaces like concrete and asphalt, the amount of water slicking off those surfaces increases. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important.” But Villarini’s team took a slightly different tack and looked at how the city’s footprint and skyline might have changed both runoff and the rain. They modeled how much rain the hurricane would have dropped on the city had the buildings been replaced with farm fields. And they found that the rough texture of the city with its buildings and complicated skyline snagged and slowed down the humid air flowing over it, boosting conditions for precipitation. To be clear, Hurricane Harvey would have dropped rain over Houston no matter what was there. But the presence of the city exacerbated the flooding across Houston by about 21 times, on average, the study says. The team doesn’t know precisely why. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important,” Villarini says. They also don’t know if these findings are specific to Harvey, or whether they’d hold up when another storm hits a different city. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem.” Still, the findings suggest that urbanization could make the flooding impacts of hurricanes worse, and in multiple different ways. “This is, as far as I know, a new result and, as the authors point out, has important implications for urban planning,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT who was not involved in the study, says in a statement emailed to The Verge. Together, the two studies show that we need to be ready for the complex ways a warmer world could change extreme weather events. And preparing for these events won’t be easy, according to Villarini. Politicians, urban developers, and engineers will all have to be involved, and will have to work together to figure out ways for their communities to survive future storms. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem,” he says.","New research published in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world.

JOHN SCHWARTZ,"So what did we miss? The city was too corrupt in a state that was too corrupt. We let education get away from us; our kids were being educated in awful buildings, and they werent learning very much. Although crime and the murder rate continue to go down, its still way too high. Income inequality continues to plague us. So if the citys going to succeed like all great cities Detroitll survive, Chicago, which was in a bad place in the 60s, has come back you need a good couple of generations of really good leadership. The citys got a long way to go. Its still one of the great cities of the world. But from an infrastructure perspective, were in a really bad situation. MR. BAQUET Are there places that shouldnt be rebuilt? Im not just talking about New Orleans. Ive spent six years in California there are places where the wildfires are that people once didnt live. Do you rebuild all of New Orleans East? Do you rebuild the parts of San Juan that are going to get whacked in the next storm? MR. LANDRIEU Were going to get hit by a lot of stuff. In the West, youre going to continue to get wildfires; youre going to get earthquakes. In the heartland, youre going to get tornadoes. In the East,youre going to get hurricanes. Eighty-five percent of the people in this country live in and around what we would call vulnerable areas. If climate change continues to do what it does, in 30 or 40 years New Orleans is going to be an island protected by the $14.6 billion levy barrier that we have, and everything south of I-10 is going to be compromised. If you back up a little bit and dont get too afraid within 100 years, the parallel where Austin and Atlanta are, is going to be the southern part of the country. That requires you to do a lot of thinking about prevention, about where people can live, where to put massive infrastructure investments.

Mark Kaufman,"The tumultuous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season proved to be one of the most active years on record, with 17 named storms and six major hurricanes. But it can get quite a bit stormier than that. In a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, researchers looked at hurricane seasons dating back to 1851 and found that it's quite unlikely any Atlantic hurricane season will surpass the 28 named storms and 15 hurricanes produced during the 2005 season, infamous for the deadly Hurricane Katrina that struck the Gulf Coast. SEE ALSO: A landmark climate change ruling could go up in smoke after Justice Kennedy retires ""To me, it makes sense that 2005 is about as many as you can get,"" Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University who had no role in the study, said in an interview. Using sophisticated weather models, the research team ran over 6,000 simulations of a wide range of weather conditions — such as temperature, winds, and air pressure — that our present climate can produce. They found that there's less than a 3.2 percent chance that any combination of conditions might result in more than 28 storms forming in any given year, which they took to mean 28 cyclones is pretty much the Atlantic Ocean's maximum storm potential. Hurricane Katrina makes landfall in 2005. Image: nasa This could be useful information for both Atlantic nations and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences’ Risk Prediction Initiative, the natural catastrophe research group that funded the study. But, it's not really the number of storms that matters for people on the ground. ""At the end of the day, if you have 28 weak pieces of junk, no one cares,"" said Klotzbach. ""It's the Irmas people care about."" Last year, Hurricane Irma made landfall several times in the Caribbean, including leveling 95 percent of the structures on the island of Barbuda, before hitting Florida and causing severe flooding. Wind and water damage from the storm in the U.S. alone amounted to an estimated $50 billion, and, in total, Irma killed 47 people, though many more indirect deaths were reported. It could be a quiet storm year overall, said Klotzbach, but ""obviously all it takes is one or two high-profile storms to make the headlines and cause a lot of damage."" How about future storms in a changing climate? This study looked exclusively at what our present climate could produce in the Atlantic. Running sophisticated models on powerful computers has time and budget constraints, so the researchers restricted their research to the present. ""Of course, future climate is very important to consider,"" Sally Lavender, the study's lead author and researcher at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research, said over email. Yet, a changing climate doesn't necessarily mean more hurricanes, like it does more heat waves and wildfires. Massive Hurricane Irma passing the eastern end of Cuba on September 8, 2017. Image: nasa ""Based on work by others it is not at all clear if we could expect an increase in the numbers of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic,"" said Lavender. Klotzbach agrees. ""Most models don’t show the number of storms increasing,"" said Klotzbach. ""In general, the number of storms is probably not going to change that much."" Still, future storms may carry more water, noted Klotzbach, or they may bring stronger winds, said Lavender. There's also strong evidence that storms are slowing down, which would mean considerably more flooding and destruction over the unlucky regions the storms stall over. Even so, Klotzbach emphasized that we might as well focus on preparing for what could happen today. In the 1940s, for example, five Category 4 and 5 storms (the highest rated storms) pummeled Florida over the course of six years. And with coastal development and massive population increases since then, we're not prepared to deal with that sort of storm onslaught, said Klotzbach. ""We’re not prepared for what we have now,"" he said. ""When Category 5's start hitting Florida again, it's going to be bad.""","The tumultuous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season proved to be one of the most active years on record, with 17 named storms and six major hurricanes.

Andrew Freedman,"A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage. These events caused 362 direct deaths. These figures come from a new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), released on Monday morning. The previous costliest year for the U.S. was 2005, when losses totaled $215 billion, largely due to the three major hurricane strikes of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. SEE ALSO: Disastrous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season ends, with hard-hit areas still reeling The number of billion-dollar events tied 2011 for the most such disasters in a single year. The Western wildfire season alone, which scorched California in particular, cost at least $18 billion, NOAA said, tripling the previous record annual wildfire cost. Hurricane Harvey, which caused the most extreme rainstorm ever observed in the U.S., had total costs of $125 billion, just behind Hurricane Katrina in the 38-year period of record for billion-dollar disasters. Insurance companies are still tallying the damage for some of these events, so these costs may yet rise further. Hurricanes Maria and Irma had total costs of $90 billion and $50 billion, respectively, and Hurricane Maria, which demolished Puerto Rico's power grid, ranks as the third-costliest weather and climate disaster on record for the nation. The spike in costs for 2017 isn't directly tied to global warming, but numerous recent studies have found that extreme heat, wildfire, and rainfall events are becoming more likely and more severe due to climate change. This could, in turn, make such disasters more expensive, depending on how vulnerable the impacted areas. In deluging Houston with up to 60 inches of rain in just a few days time, Hurricane Harvey, for example, hit one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the U.S., where rampant urban development did not take into account the threat of heavy rainfall. Third-warmest year for the U.S. The NOAA report also found that 2017 was the third-warmest year on record for the lower 48 states, with an average annual temperature that was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th Century average. This was slightly cooler than 2012 and 2016, but it marks the 21st straight warmer-than-average year for the country. In other words, if you were born in the U.S. in 1997 and remained here since, you've never experienced a cooler-than-average year in the U.S. In fact, the globe has not experienced a cooler-than-average month since December of 1984. Strikingly, the five warmest years on record for the contiguous U.S. have all occurred since 2006, NOAA found. This year, every state across the lower 48 and Alaska had an above-average annual temperature, and five states — Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, and South Carolina — had their warmest year on record. Thirty-two additional states, including Alaska, had a top-10 warmest year. One way that NOAA measures extreme weather is via the Climate Extremes Index, which takes into account temperatures, precipitation, tropical storms and hurricanes, and other factors. In 2017 it had the second-highest value in the 108-year period of record, which was more than double the average. Only 2012 had a higher value on this index, NOAA said. Extremes in warm maximum and minimum temperatures, one-day precipitation totals, days with precipitation and landfalling tropical cyclones contributed to the elevated extremes index, NOAA found. According to NOAA, during the past 38 years, the U.S. has sustained 219 weather and climate disasters where the overall damage costs reached or exceeded $1 billion. The cumulative costs for these 219 events exceed $1.5 trillion.","A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage.

Morgan Sung,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names. The World Meteorological Organization announced Thursday that it's retiring the names Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate from its rotation because of 2017's devastating season. It's replacing the names with Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel instead. SEE ALSO: Shell knew truth of global warming in 1980s; foresaw a Hurricane Sandy scenario WMO names each hurricane based on an alphabetical rotation of names, alternating between male and female names. The selection of names for each rotation is usually used every six years, so we won't see Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel come into use until 2023. If a hurricane is especially fatal and causes significant damage, its name is taken off the rotation and replaced with a different one. According to the WMO's FAQ, this naming system makes it easier for news outlets to report on the storms and increases community preparedness. ""Experience shows that the use of short, distinctive given names in written as well as spoken communications is quicker and less subject to error than the older more cumbersome latitude-longitude identification methods,"" WMO's FAQ says. WMO says that the 2017 hurricane season was ""one of the most destructive on record,"" with damages in the United States alone costing $250 billion. The 2017 hurricane season was one of the most destructive on record. Image: world METEOROLOGICAL organization The hurricanes taken off the WMO's rotation of names caused 224 deaths during their tropical cyclone phases. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria were the first Category 4 storms to make landfall in the United States on record. Irma and Maria both reached Category 5 storms when they made landfall on the Caribbean islands. The damage caused in the Caribbean is likely to take years to recover, according to WMO. Seventeen tropical storms were named in 2017, and 10 of those storms became hurricanes. Six reached ""major hurricane strength"" and clocked in at Category 3 or higher. This is above the average for annual storms; from 1981-2010, the average was 12 tropical storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. Harvey made landfall over or near Texas last August as a Category 4 hurricane. It lasted for four days, devastating Houston and causing the deaths of 68 people. It was the costliest hurricane after Katrina, causing an estimated $125 billion in damages. Irma caused significant destruction in the Caribbean as a Category 5 hurricane, nearly wiping out Barbuda. It was the first hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since 1932, and it prompted the evacuation of about 6 million people in southern Florida. Maria ripped through Dominica and Puerto Rico in September. Dominica's damages are estimated at $1.3 billion, or about 224 percent of its GDP according to WMO. The entire island of Puerto Rico lost power, which one report concluded was the second largest blackout in history. Nate crossed from Nicaragua to Honduras as a tropical storm, but made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. The rainfall from Nate caused 44 deaths in Central America. 2017 retired almost as many names as 2005, when the severe hurricane season resulted in WMO removing Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma from the rotation.","Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"In September, following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Congress approved $15 billion in relief aid. Lawmakers signed off on another $36.5 billion for storm and wildfires assistance in October, after weeks of criticism leveled against the Trump administration for its response to Maria in Puerto Rico. The $90 billion disaster relief package outlined on Wednesday also includes aid for communities affected by hurricanes or wildfires in California, Florida, Texas and the Virgin Islands. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, Congress approved $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency four days later, and another $50 billion six days later. The federal government is still spending money on Katrina assistance, more than 12 years after the storm’s landfall. Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in nearly a century, the island was already grappling with insolvency. The government declared a form of bankruptcy last May, after years of borrowing money to pay for operating expenses after a painful recession that began in 2006. The relief package sets aside $4.8 billion for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, helping to avoid a looming shortfall that could have left some 600,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Puerto Rico without health insurance by April. Puerto Rican leaders worried some of the people left uninsured would migrate to the mainland seeking coverage. Compared to the states, territories receive only a fraction of funding for entitlement programs. The Senate deal would waive the requirement for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to share in the cost of Medicaid for two years, placing the funding responsibility on the federal government instead. Louisiana received the same reprieve after Hurricane Katrina, but for only one year, said Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting delegate in Congress. Lawmakers approved relief packages for 10 years after that storm, she noted. Puerto Rico is not that far removed yet from Hurricane Maria. “Receiving these funds is important, and that will demonstrate that Puerto Rico will use them wisely and with transparency,” she said. “That’s an important issue here: We can be a model for how to invest in infrastructure on the island.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, said the $2 billion earmarked for power restoration in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could help his island harden its battered grid. While funds from the previous aid packages went to FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, the latest relief package will give money directly to the Puerto Rican government. Twenty-eight percent of Puerto Ricans — more than 400,000 utility customers — still do not have power more than four months after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico. “With these resources, we can begin rebuilding our housing and energy future, putting Puerto Rico on a new path forward,” Mr. Rosselló said in a statement.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","An estimated 2,300 children have been separated from their parents as a result of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy. Though President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday reversing his stance on separating families (the zero-tolerance policy is still in effect, meaning people will still be prosecuted), it does not reunite those who have already been separated. In many cases, parents cannot afford bail or are being deported before they’re reunited with their children, and images of children locked in prison-like conditions and reports of rampant abuse and neglect are enraging and mobilizing people across the country. It’s only human to want to help in any way you can, and for many people that means giving money to organizations and charities doing good work. And while you shouldn’t be deterred from giving in times of need, you should also be on the lookout for scammers who use people’s pain for financial gain. After pretty much every major incident in the U.S.—from September 11 to Sandy Hook to Hurricane Katrina —fake charities and organizations proliferate to steal from unsuspecting good Samaritans. Hitting the streets to make your voice heard is a fundamental right in the United States, and it’s… Read more Read Here’s how to avoid being scammed. Do Your Research There are a few places you can research organizations and how they use their funds: A good rule of thumb is to look for orgs that spend no more than 20 percent of their funds on overhead costs, which you can find on Charity Navigator. One reason to donate to a larger organization is because they have the knowledge and experience to use funds and not be overwhelmed by an influx of donations. A small shop run by people with no experience managing millions of dollars will likely not maximize use of the money (and it’s been an issue over and over again after catastrophic events like the Sandy Hook massacre and even Hurricane Harvey ). But this isn’t fool-proof. The New York Times reported on the Red Cross’s botched relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina, for example, and ProPublica and NPR detailed how the Red Cross dropped the ball after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. New charities and organizations do pop up in the aftermath of disasters that intend to do good work, and they won’t have ratings on these sites. In that case, you can research on their website to see how the money is to be used. If they don’t have any info, that’s not a good sign—and in fact, is likely a deal-breaker. It’s fine to want to raise money, but the org should have a plan of how it will be dispersed first. One other way to donate: Companies like GoFundMe verify fundraising campaigns, and will update info on how the money is being spent. To help families at the border, see this page. If you plan to donate to The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an organization that helps… Read more Read Ask Where Your Money Is Going If you’re giving money and can’t find where it’s going on the org’s website, you can ask what it will be used for, or even stipulate how the funds should be dispersed. If reps from the organization are cagey or vague, consider sending your money somewhere else. Don’t Donate on Social Media... It might be easy to donate through Twitter and Facebook, but experts have advised against doing so. The same is true for text messages and email—scammers can easily send phishing emails or fake text alerts. The best way to donate is directly through an organization’s website. Communicating with the people that are supposed to represent you in government can sound like a… Read more Read... With Smart Exceptions That said, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) in Texas is the recipient of funds from a viral Facebook campaign to raise money to reunite kids with their parents. It’s raised over $15 million thus far, which might seem like an overwhelming amount for the little-known nonprofit. But RAICES has a detailed breakdown of how the funds will be used: The Legal Representation, Advocacy, and Education (LEAF) Project: This effort provides representation for released unaccompanied children in Texas “so they do not have to do this alone.” Family Reunification and Bond Fund: FREE our Families: This fund “support[s] legal services for detained separated parents and the direct funding for bonds to get parents released.” Bonds for these parents are set at a minimum of $1,500, and are more often in the $5,000-$10,000, according to RAICES. Also important: Facebook does not collect a fee on charitable donations that are processed through the Fundraiser feature (places like GoFundMe do charge a fee, though they waive it some cases). You can also donate directly through the organization’s website if you want to help but don’t want to donate through Facebook, or volunteer with RAICES. They are looking for attorneys and graphic designers, and people who speak Spanish and French. Lifehacker has also compiled this list of additional ways to help. That said, you can keep track of and demand accountability from the organizations you donate to in the ensuing years. They should be able to provide detailed reports of how all the money is spent. If you think you’ve been scammed, you can file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.","An estimated 2,300 children have been separated from their parents as a result of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy.

"Ian Graber-Stiehl on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In 2005, Lee Scott, CEO of Walmart, was troubled. Activists had recently illuminated Walmarts connections to human rights abuses, and his companys stock was in worse shape than Californias water supply. Then, a storm arrived. As hurricane Katrina drowned the Gulf Coast coast, it provided Walmart its salvation. The company gave district and store managers in affected states free rein to do whatever they thought would help their surrounding communities. One manager in Mississippi literally bulldozed a path into her store to acquire essential supplies and provide them to those in need. In some areas, Walmarts efforts outpaced government relief. The media, and even activist groups opposing Walmart, took notice, lavishing the corporate giant with praise. And Scott began to question whether Walmart could use its prodigious size and resources not just to reap profits, but to help people and the planet. Doing so might even pay huge dividends in Walmarts public relations. The CEOs new perspective spurred one of the biggest sustainability initiatives ever enacted. Since Katrina, the company has dramatically reduced its waste and taken steps to source products from more sustainable suppliers. Earlier this year, Walmart partnered with utilities to increase its renewable energy production by 1.6 billion kilowatt-hours enough to power over 140,000 homes for a year. But a lack of transparency around its total energy consumption, waste production, and product sustainability makes it difficult to contextualize many of Walmarts environmental wins. And given the companys sheer size, theres plenty of reason to question whether Walmart is doing enough. Managing green Scott laid out three goals in 2005: Produce zero waste, use 100 percent renewable energy, and sell products that sustain our resources and environment. (The last goal has since been changed to that sustain people and the environment.) To accomplish this Walmart had to do two things. It had to make its business and supply chain more environmentally efficient, and it had sell more sustainable products. The punchline, said Andrew Spicer, a University of South Carolina professor and leading expert on Walmarts sustainability initiative, is that they did better at those things they had under their control, and which they could measure. Things like Walmarts transport fleet, waste production, store design, and energy use could be tweaked on the fly. Imposing standards on its suppliers proved far more difficult. To spearhead its environmentalist overhaul, Walmart leaned on Blu Skye Consulting, a company with leadership intertwined with Conservation International. By 2007, Blu Sky had established 14 Sustainable Value Networks or SVNs, decentralized departments focused on waste, energy, and water usage. The SVNs split progress into long-term goals, such as making their transport fleet and stores more fuel and energy efficient, and quick wins designed to boost enthusiasm, garner headlines, and demonstrate capability. For instance, in 2007, Walmarts plastic recycling saved $3.5 million and prevented 1,100 tons of plastic from making its way to landfills. Since then Walmart has made bounds in waste reduction, now reporting that 82.4 percent of its US operations waste is diverted from going directly to a landfill. Much of this waste reduction has been the product of Walmart pressuring suppliers into reducing packaging, as when it had Kid Connection reduce packaging for a toy car/truck set, saving 5,200 trees. Walmart has pushed to replace confusing food labels such as Best if sold by to Best by in an effort to reduce food waste. And unlike many, the company sells much misshapen produce and runs donation, animal feed, and composting programs for old food. In a report released earlier this year by the Center for Biological Diversity, Walmart was the only one of Americas 10 largest grocery companies to score a B grade on food waste. No one got an A. But these numbers dont tell the full story. Walmart has also expanded programs to refurbish old equipment in its stores and warehouses, and to recycle waste. The company Ecotech, for example, works with American Walmarts to recycle 4 million pounds of plastic bags into a variety of products, according to Walmarts Director of Sustainability Communications Micah Ragland. In 2017, Walmart claims to have recycled more than 421,000 tons of cardboard and plastics globally. But these numbers dont tell the full story. Walmart keenly highlights specific waste-reducing initiatives, but comprehensive figures on total waste production arent publicly available. When Earther asked Walmart representatives for these figures, we got only statistics about a hodgepodge of waste and carbon footprint-reducing initiatives. The same goes for Walmarts energy use. The company has overhauled its refrigeration, lighting, and more to lower energy use. It aims to reduce emissions by 18 percent and draw half of its energy from renewables by 2025. Estimates that 28 percent of Walmarts global energy consumption is renewable abound. Yet, Walmart is hardly transparent on its total energy use. When Earther asked Walmart representatives for figures on its net energy consumption, the company instead sent information on various energy-reduction and renewables programs. The EPA, for its part, pegs the current percentage of Walmarts U.S. energy consumption that is renewable at around 4 percent and has since at least 2012. While that places Walmart third in the EPAs top 30 list of green-powered retailers, Starbucks and Apple, the latter of which dwarfs Walmarts energy consumption, buy or generate enough renewable electricity to cover over 100 percent of their operations. Google, with over 3 times the energy consumption depends on renewables for 50 percent of its power. And more than one advocacy group has contested that the companys growth will outpace its renewables expansion. Ragland disputes that last claim, telling Earther that while Walmarts overall square footprint grew slightly from 2014 to 2015, its emissions declined. Still, one could hardly be blamed for feeling that the earths largest company still being halfway to halfway with its renewable energy goals 13 years after they were conceived doesnt amount to a revolution. Selling sustainable Selling more sustainable products is the hard part for two reasons: First, Walmart isnt Whole Foods. It prices are low; its profit margins thin. It cant swap out its inventory for pricier, but more eco-friendly products. And second, defining sustainable is really goddamn hard. Thats why in 2009 Walmart founded the Sustainability Consortium, a group of now more than 100 companies that establish criteria for judging products sustainability. As Spicer and colleague David Hyatt recount in a paper published last year, the Consortium at first set about judging products using a gold standard Earther has explored before : Life-Cycle Analyses. LCAs break down the various resources used and byproducts churned out in items lifecycle, including water, solid waste, greenhouse emissions and smog, to arrive at an estimate of the products overall environmental footprint. The Consortium started with just 7 products. After two years, it decided the LCA method would be slow going. So instead, the Consortium turned to a Metacritic-esque model, wherein the opinions of scientific experts, industry leaders, and published LCA studies were all reviewed in product analyses. By 2015, the group had produced a list of 110 product performance indicators, published as the Product Sustainability Toolkit for its members. But if Walmart has access to a somewhat scientific way to analyze products sustainability, why have you never heard of it? Why arent green products labeled as such? As Consortium co-director Jon Johnson put it, There is a fundamental difference between a system containing data sufficient to create a label and the label itself. We could be very cynical about that. [Its] gonna be the suppliers themselves reporting on their own performance, so theyre gonna try to game it. Walmart could label products, but the moment it started doing so, itd spark backlash. Someone, whether a chagrined company or incensed advocates, would cry bias. Maybe the sustainable label didnt consider worker or animal ethics, maybe water use and carbon output werent weighted the way someone liked. Walmart decided it would be easier to simply not advertise its rating system, and instead pressure companies behind the scenes to make their products more sustainable. That pressure, though, has often been lackluster. Walmart buys 70 percent of its U.S. goods from suppliers that participate (not score x percentage, but simply participate) in the Sustainability Indexthe Consortiums grading system. And remember, that Consortium is made up of the very companies whose products are being graded. We could be very cynical about that, said Craig Smith, INSEAD Professor of Ethics and Social Responsibility. [Its] gonna be the suppliers themselves reporting on their own performance, so theyre gonna try to game it. With little public pressure or attention given to Walmarts sustainability initiative, theres little incentive to convince the company to ratchet its goals up or be more transparent. While Walmarts consumer base does include some eco-conscious millennials, it predominantly targets lower-income consumers that are less likely to vote with their dollars. And Walmart simply isnt going to drop entire categories of environmentally-damaging products. As Scott once told reporters, If the customer wants bottled water, we are going to sell bottled water. At the same time, Walmart motivates other companies to clean up their act. Spicer and Hyatt observed that when consultancy Pure Strategies surveyed 100 companies to see learn who encourages their investments in product sustainability, Walmart was the top retail driver. That makes Walmart a leader when it comes to corporate sustainability. But what does that say about our expectations? The sprawling giant is making greater strides than most, but thats due in large part to the sheer size of its gait. As long as customers set the bar low, companies nearly as titanic will keep taking incremental steps forward, and greenwash them as auspicious leaps.","In 2005, Lee Scott, CEO of Walmart, was troubled.

MEKELA PANDITHARATNE,"The wind and rain began lashing New Orleans in the early hours of Aug. 29, 2005, while President George W. Bush was on vacation at his ranch in Texas. As the levees buckled and water poured into the city, the federal government tarried. Later, Hurricane Katrina’s long pall — the more than 1,800 related deaths, the devastation and the slow federal response — would come to haunt Mr. Bush’s presidency, cratering his approval rating. President Trump, who has overseen his own hurricane crisis after last year’s storms in Texas and Puerto Rico, has largely escaped the presidency-defining censure that dogged Mr. Bush after Hurricane Katrina. Last week,Puerto Rico’s government increased the island’s official death toll, estimating that 2,975 people died as a result of the hurricane and its effects — up from the tally of just 64 that had been the official count until then. Nearly one year after the storm hit, we now know that Hurricane Maria may be among the deadliest natural disasters to occur in the United States in a century. So why the pass for President Trump?

NICHOLAS KRISTOF,"Prof. Michael E. Mann of Penn State told me that Hurricane Michael should be a wake-up call. As should have Katrina, Irene, Sandy, Harvey, Irma, Florence, he added wryly. In each of these storms we can see the impact of climate change: Warmer seas means more energy to intensify these storms, more wind damage, bigger storm surge and more coastal flooding. As recently as the early 2000s, there wasnt much difference between the parties on climate policy, and Senator John McCain campaigned in 2008 as a leader in reducing carbon emissions. In 2009, Donald Trump joined other business executives in backing more action to address climate change. Yet in the following years Al Gore helped make climate change a Democratic issue, and the Koch brothers helped make climate denial a litmus test of Republican authenticity. Tribalism took over, and climate skepticism became part of the Republican creed. So polls show that today climate denial is far greater in the United States, home to the greatest scientific research in the world, than in just about any other major country. Trump says he will pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, and he had nothing substantive to say about a new United Nations report, which has been called a deafening, piercing smoke alarm of catastrophic consequences ahead from climate change. Republicans are correct that all this is uncertain. But in every other context, we try to prevent threats that are uncertain, and its irrational for Trump to be obsessed with, say, Iran, when he seems indifferent to the prospect that we are collectively cooking our entire planet. There are legitimate debates about the best way to reduce carbon emissions, and there is reason for skepticism that we will succeed. Carbon taxes would have to be very substantial to have a large impact, geoengineering is uncertain, and there will be painful trade-offs ahead.","Hurricane Michael hit Port St. Joe, Fla., with full force on Wednesday.",2018-10-10T23:24:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The ‘Greatest Hoax’ Strikes Florida,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/opinion/climate-change-hurricane-michael.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/opinion/10kristofSub/10kristofSub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Katrina,1
NICOLE STEPHENS,"During survey interviews, survivors who stayed focused on interdependence, emphasizing themes of sticking together, religious faith and communal and family ties. In fact, over two-thirds of those who stayed explicitly discussed the importance of connections to others. “We had a good community” one Katrina survivor in the New Orleans area said. “All the people here help one another.” Another said, “I was worried and not only for myself, but for a lot of the people.” As critics of storm holdouts may suspect, nearly half of those who stayed also discussed the importance of being tough or strong in the face of hardship, but this was never the sole factor. The silver lining of residents weathering a dangerous storm with one another is visible in the ways communities come together in a chaotic aftermath to share boats, food, and emergency supplies. Such acts of neighborly bravery have been caught on camera, or retold on social media, during ad hoc rescue operations for multiple hurricanes. These benefits may especially resonate with working-class Americans, who are more likely to think of themselves as part of a broader social network, with responsibilities to vulnerable neighbors; in contrast, members of the middle- and upper-class, who tend to evacuate, are more likely to think of themselves as independent families, free to come and go as they please. Considering the government’s slow and inept response to recent natural disasters, it is not surprising that people — especially those in working-class and minority communities — frequently do not trust the government’s disaster preparation. When the sentiment that the government doesn’t care about “people like us” is widespread, the likelihood of those people complying with mandatory evacuation orders drops. Like Hurricane Katrina before it, the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, in 2017, was a tragic reminder that our government desperately needs to improve its ability to respond effectively to the immediate and long-term needs of citizens who endure natural disasters.","Jay Allen swam in the pool at his residence in Garden Beach, S.C., on Thursday, having decided to ignore an order to evacuate the day before Hurricane Florence makes landfall.",2018-09-14T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why Do People Stay When a Hurricane Comes?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/opinion/hurricane-maria-staying-home.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/opinion/14nicolestephens/14nicolestephens-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Katrina,1
Nick Stockton,"Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, Donald Trump flew to Puerto Rico, toured a relatively affluent neighborhood there, and expressed his relief that the storm had not been “a real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina. He jokingly chided Puerto Ricans for throwing the federal budget a “little out of whack.” In reality, Maria caused the largest blackout in US history, and the federal disaster response on the island was, at that point, a fraction of what residents of Florida and Texas had received during the same hurricane season. The government of Puerto Rico recently published a report estimating the storm's death toll at 1,427 people, more than 20 times the previous estimate. According to The New England Journal of Medicine, the storm and its aftermath ultimately killed more than 4,000. If the federal government’s response to Maria was a scandal, the tech industry’s initial reaction seemed, comparatively, like a source of hope. In the days after the disaster, a small groundswell of private tech enthusiasm furthered the notion that Puerto Rico ought to become a test bed for renewable, distributed, climate-­resilient infrastructure. Companies like Alphabet and Tesla, which were already working on the island, looked like they might be poised to make this idea a reality. Later, a different set of tech entrepreneurs descended on Puerto Rico as well, enticed by tax breaks to advance other, more esoteric techno-​utopian visions. Here’s a progress report on how tech has, and hasn’t, managed to come to Puerto Rico’s rescue. Alphabet For years, Alphabet’s X (formerly known as Google X) has been working on a project called Loon, which provides cell service to remote areas via giant balloons. And it just so happened that one of the company’s two launch facilities for those signal-­slinging balloons was located in Ceiba, on Puerto Rico’s eastern coast. So the company deployed a handful of the floating antennas, blanketing the island with text and data service for more than 250,000 customers of T-Mobile and AT&amp;T for four months while parts of the electrical grid were down. Tesla Two weeks after the storm, Elon Musk wrote on Twitter that Tesla had a track record of building decentralized electrical infrastructure—independent solar and battery systems—on small islands. “There is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too,” he said. Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, tweeted back: “Let’s talk.” Since then, updates have come mostly in the form of more tweets. In April, Musk reported that “Tesla batteries are currently live &amp; delivering power at 662 locations in Puerto Rico.” Then in June he tweeted, “We have about 11,000 projects underway” on the island. Tesla has declined to clarify what that means or how many Puerto Ricans are served by those projects. The Blockchain Crowd Over the past year, about 150 cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have settled on the island, according to Giovanni Mendez, a tax lawyer who has helped many of them. They’ve been drawn in part by incentives, passed in 2012, that give tax exemptions for capital gains and passive income to individuals who spend at least half their year on the island, and by an amendment, passed just months before Hurricane Maria, that eased requirements on US companies to hire Puerto Rican residents. One of the new arrivals was the cryptocurrency guru and former child actor Brock Pierce, who promptly said he was setting out to build a utopian community—perhaps even a whole new city—on the island, to the ire of many Puerto Ricans.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"For Mr. Rosselló, the funding fight is a question of fairness. For every long-term rebuilding project underway in Puerto Rico at this point after Hurricane Maria, there were 28 projects underway in Texas for damage from Hurricane Harvey, and 32 projects in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, the governor said. Puerto Rico is getting much fewer and much lower resources than any comparable jurisdiction in the United States.
A University of Michigan analysis published in the journal BMJ Global Health in January found it took twice as long four months for Hurricane Maria survivors in Puerto Rico to receive a comparable amount of individual aid (about $1 billion) as Hurricane Harvey survivors in Texas and Hurricane Irma survivors in Florida, though Maria was stronger and more devastating. Maria killed an estimated 2,975 people in Puerto Rico.
In addition to the slow disbursement of aid, a report last month from the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development lacked a robust plan to monitor disaster relief grants, including $20 billion approved for Puerto Rico.
In Vieques, with the hospital out of commission, dialysis patients had to travel to the big island three times a week to get treatment for more than a year after the storm. Several patients died. Finally, in November, a mobile dialysis unit in a shiny trailer arrived at the temporary clinic, allowing local treatments to resume.
It wasnt easy, said Edwin Alvarado Cordero, a 58-year-old diabetic. Standing across the street from the pharmacy in Isabel Segunda, the bigger of the islands two towns, Mr. Alvarado recounted his thrice-weekly trips from Vieques to Humacao, which began at 4 a.m. and ended at 5:30 p.m.
Last year, on the ferry to the big island, Mr. Alvarado suffered a heart attack. He had open-heart surgery and survived. Though he can now receive dialysis in Vieques, he still travels to San Juan periodically to see his cardiologist. Specialists visit Vieques infrequently.
Its far, but its better there, Mr. Alvarado said. Whats left of the hospital here is grass and horses.

Rayne Ellis,"Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria one year ago next month. Since the island's long recovery began, the government and independent institutions have worked to figure out exactly how many lives were taken by the effects of the extreme storm. SEE ALSO: We may never see a hurricane season worse than the one that brought us Katrina Today, we have a new, better estimate — and it’s more than 46 times the old one. According to a new study released by George Washington University (GW), 2,975 people died as a result of the hurricane. The government of Puerto Rico now accepts that number as an accurate death toll, updating their previous official estimate of 64. A group of workers repair a gravestone damaged by Hurricane Maria in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images The GW group teamed up with the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health to analyze death certificates and other mortality data collected from September 2017 to February 2018. They found that the number of deaths during that time were uncharacteristically high, when compared to that same time period from other years. “The results of our epidemiological study suggest that, tragically, Hurricane Maria led to a large number of excess deaths throughout the island. Certain groups – those in lower income areas and the elderly – faced the highest risk,” lead investigator Carlos Santos-Burgoa said in statement on Tuesday. In fact, the study found that in the poorest communities, the risk of dying increased 60 percent in the wake of Hurricane Maria. And the risk of dying increased 35 percent for older Puerto Rican males. This means that though the exact causes of death may be varied or unclear, in the six months after Hurricane Maria, more people died than usual. This kind of statistical analysis allows researchers to say that the hurricane left groups of people extremely vulnerable after the storm, even if the flooding rains and wind didn't explicitly kill these individuals. Broken headstones pile up in a cemetery in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images Researchers and journalists alike have long speculated that Puerto Rico’s official death toll of 64 was suspiciously low. Back in 2017, a New York Times investigation estimated that the death toll was around 1,052 — nearly 1,000 more than the original calculation. This led the governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Roselló, to commission an independent study looking into the death toll in February 2018. “It is of great interest to the State to identify how many lives were lost due to the passage of Maria through the Island,"" Roselló said in a statement announcing the effort. ""It is our interest that experts can identify as accurately as possible the deaths directly and indirectly associated with the hurricane to improve protocols for future natural disasters.” In early July, researchers at Harvard released a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine which estimated that an excess of 4,500 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria by surveying more than 3,000 houses. Then in late July, the Puerto Rican government quietly acknowledged that the death toll was likely much higher than 64, after releasing a 400-page document that put the toll at more than 1,400 people. The government waited for the GW study to officially update the death toll. Broken tree branches pile up as workers push to clear out cemeteries in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images The newest count puts Hurricane Maria in second place as the deadliest hurricane to ever hit the United States, behind the Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900 which reportedly took 6,000 lives or more. Aside from the official death toll, the study also provided recommendations to Puerto Rico’s local government and the U.S. federal government to better prepare for the next deadly storm. The study suggests a more efficient way to tally deaths after disasters, a fully staffed Department of Health, better intra-department communication, and other recommendations. “The lessons learned from this report and subsequent studies will help not just Puerto Rico, but other regions in the U.S. and around the world that face the ongoing threat of hurricanes and other natural disasters,” co-author Lynn R. Goldman said. “If enacted, the recommendations of this report could help save lives in Puerto Rico and beyond.”","Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria one year ago next month.

FRANCES ROBLES,"“We don’t want to spend the rest of our lives in hotels,” Mr. Santiago said. “We’re not asking FEMA to support us, just to help us until we are more stable. If this has been so hard for me, I can’t imagine what it’s like for the people with little kids or illnesses.” Mr. Santiago moved to Florida in December from Corozal, where his home was destroyed. He is working for a transportation company but not earning enough to afford an apartment. “Every time the deadline approaches, your nerves are shot,” he said. Lawyers for LatinoJustice argued that survivors of past storms had received more help. Hurricane Katrina survivors stayed in hotels for 27 months, Ms. Bannan said. Hurricane Harvey and Irma victims received seven benefit extensions, but Hurricane Maria survivors received just three, the group said. The judge found, however, that those previous storms affected far more people. The governor of Puerto Rico, the judge noted, stopped asking for extensions to the voucher program once a provision under FEMA rules took effect that would have required the government of Puerto Rico to share 10 percent of the housing costs. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. FEMA said there are 1,038 families still receiving Transitional Shelter Assistance across 27 states, with about 400 of them in Puerto Rico. “FEMA is working with its vendor and notifying participating hotels that the TSA program has been extended to comply with the court’s order, said Lenisha Smith, a FEMA spokeswoman. “Beyond that, FEMA will not comment on pending litigation.” Although Judge Hillman found that FEMA’s funding of the housing assistance program was “discretionary” and denied the request for an injunction, he urged the government to find a way to help the families.","After months of temporary reprieves, the judge says temporary housing vouchers for victims of Hurricane Maria staying in hotels can be ended on Sept. 13.",2018-08-31T17:02:34Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Government Can Stop Paying to House Puerto Rico Hurricane Victims, Judge Rules",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/us/puerto-rico-fema-housing.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/31/us/31puerto-print/31puerto-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Katrina,1
Chris Jones,"On August 24 at 8:20 pm, a 44-year-old moonlighting meteorologist named Eric Berger was nearly finished writing a post for his Houston-centric blog, Space City Weather, titled “ Harvey Late Night: Some Final Thursday Thoughts.” He was in his home office. He had just poured himself a glass of cabernet. He had been looking at the online forecasts from the National Hurricane Center and agreed with their essential conclusions: Harvey was a well-­organized storm that would land with hurricane force on the Texas Gulf Coast somewhere between Corpus Christi and Port O’Connor. Berger also backed the center’s belief that the winds would be strong in Houston that weekend, perhaps more than 40 miles per hour. But he was far more worried about the rain. The unanswered question is what happens to Harvey once it reaches the coast, Berger wrote. Where will it go, and will it go fast enough? Houston’s rainfall totals over the next five days depend on this, and we just don’t know. The considerable majority of modern weather forecasting is aided by computer algorithm. Most hurricane tracking relies on data crunched by various public and private computer models, and the models, which take different variables (temperature, moisture, mass) and consider them in different ways, are not always in agreement. The National Hurricane Center takes input from several models to make its predictions, averaging out their differences, in part because it faces the tallest order in hurricane forecasting: It must say that the hurricane will go here. So must television meteorologists, one of the center’s principal conduits to a concerned public. TV, too, demands a singular answer. Berger doesn’t have to draw a line. He is a certified meteorologist, but the weather is just a particularly absorbing hobby of his; his primary paying gig is writing about aerospace for Ars Technica (a site owned by WIRED Media Group), and he blogs about the weather in his free time. That gives him two luxuries that most front-line meteorologists don’t have: He can value certain models and their ensembles much more heavily than others, untangling as many as 50 different versions of each forecast, and he can also admit doubt. He can explore the subtlety of the weather, marveling at its mysteries, the way he has for his small but loyal community of readers for years, but especially since he established his site in October 2015. Berger does not generate his forecasts from scratch, pointing his licked finger into the wind and taking readings from the Galileo thermometer on his windowsill. He really does have a Galileo thermometer on his windowsill, but he works out of a home office that he hasn’t otherwise bothered to decorate, with a basic PC and a single monitor on which he toggles between tabs, from forecast to conflicting forecast. In Houston that evening, the US government forecast called for about 15 inches of rain. By then Berger had already begun to wonder. There is one model he has come to trust and rely on more than any other: the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ Integrated Forecasting System, more popularly known in the US as the European model. Funded by 22 EU members and 12 cooperating states, the European model is sometimes shockingly accurate, in part because it’s so well financed and its computing power is stronger than most. With Harvey, it suggested that the storm would stall over Houston, dumping 25 inches of rain or more before eventually moving on. That synced with Berger’s own analysis of the weather patterns in the atmosphere. He detected a troublesome absence of steering currents, the forces that push hurricanes to wherever they’re headed next, and without those currents, the European model’s forecast of a stall made a lot of sense. Given the sum of the evidence before him, Berger felt confident in one fearsome prediction, and he wrote as much: Big-time floods are coming to Texas. It was, at its essence, an informed gut call, and Berger thought carefully about what he would write next. He had made his reputation, such as it was for a leisure-­time meteorologist with a city-specific weather blog, by refusing to submit to the hysterical frenzies that competent weather observers dismiss as “storm porn.” He is by nature a fairly skeptical person. His twin passions, space and the weather, share long histories of broken promises and unmet expectations. His site’s motto is “Hype-free forecasts for greater Houston,” mindful of the chaotic and ultimately unnecessary evacuations prompted by Hurricane Rita in 2005. I am not going to sugar-coat this, my friends, he had written in advance of that storm. As a Houston resident and property owner, I am truly mortified right now. Rita and Berger had both missed. But underplaying weather of dire consequences could lead to a different kind of calamity for his readers. James Spann, Alabama’s longtime weather forecaster of choice, had infamously botched that state’s ice storms of January 2014. Spann had predicted a “dusting” of snow, and unworried commuters headed out on the roads; when that dusting turned out to be a thick layer of ice, Spann shouldered much of the blame for the thousands of people who ended up stranded in their cars, schools, and workplaces overnight. Berger despises alarmism in all its forms. He also didn’t want to bear responsibility for children drowning in their attics. Berger’s wife, Amanda, was getting their own two daughters ready for bed in their League City apartment, temporary accommodations while the family builds their dream home in nearby Clear Creek. His dog, Bonnie, a Maltese-­poodle cross who dislikes all men but him, kept her usual vigilant watch. Berger can be painfully shy. Now he felt possessed by an unusual authority, exercised remotely through the digitally transmitted written word. He took another sip of his wine and returned to his keyboard. Certainly the Corpus Christi area and points immediately north and west of there will get too much rain, he wrote. Flooding will spread to other parts of Texas too, quite possibly Houston. But right now we can’t say that for certain. As I’ve said, it’s either going to be pretty bad, or really really bad here. He posted his piece. His site normally averaged somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 views a day. That particular entry received 207,334 over the next 24 hours. A shocked Berger surmised that his core readers were recommending him to their suddenly weather-concerned friends. He had become the center of a kind of storm within the storm. In the comments, one reader asked what Berger thought the rainfall totals might be in San Antonio, 200 miles to the west. Someone else asked about Colorado County, and another about the neighborhoods near Ellington Field. Another reader wondered whether her husband’s flight out of Hobby Airport on Saturday morning might be delayed. A man named Petey James pointed out that Saturday night was the night of the big fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor, and he wanted to know whether he should risk going to the local bar or pay to watch it at home. A woman named Deb Walters asked whether she should still have the party she had planned to host near Dacus on Saturday afternoon. I’d press ahead at this point, Berger wrote to her. Obviously if things turn ugly Saturday morning, you’ll have to cancel. The following morning, Friday, August 25, it started to rain, a few drops at first, and then a fairly steady shower. Harvey’s leading edge had come to town, and the models, constantly updated, began to align: Harvey was nearly laser-precise in its construction and massive, and it was also a slow mover. The rain was going to be measured in feet, not inches. Berger sat down at his desk, no wine this time, and wrote another post. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming, ” he wrote. He wrote it two more times for emphasis. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming. A very serious flooding situation is coming. ” It was 3:15 pm. He hoped Deb Walters had canceled her party. Millions turned to Berger’s Space City Weather blog during the storm. Since 1980, there have been more than 200 weather and climate events in the United States that have each caused more than $1 billion in damage. Three principal national bodies are charged with predicting their arrivals and effects. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, keeps watch for tornadoes. The Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, monitors heavy rains. And the National Hurricane Center in Miami minds hurricanes. They have been busy. In the case of Harvey, all three were involved, funneling their best information to the Houston branch of the National Weather Service, one of its 122 field offices across the country. Each helps turn national forecasts into finely tuned local ones. The Houston office is the only one that shares space with its home county’s Office of Emergency Management—Galveston County in its case—better to coordinate their shared response. It is no accident that their building sits atop a mound and that their offices are on the upper floor. Over the past few decades, greater Houston has grown exponentially from a mosquito-­plagued oil port into the fifth-largest metro area in the United States, home to nearly 7 million people. That population explosion, combined with a certain regional antipathy toward civic oversight, has seen former swamps turned into sprawling, unregulated developments. Houston has been built to flood. Dan Reilly, 52, is the local Warning Coordination Meteorologist, part of the National Weather Service’s round-the-clock professional staff. In a catastrophe-prone city like his, the job is twofold. The first is the forecast. “When something bad is coming, that’s really when we need to be at the top of our game,” he says. Of the three most damaging effects of hurricanes—wind, storm surge, and rain—rain is one of the most difficult to quantify in advance. The heaviest rain typically falls in small pockets, and that level of precision is difficult to attain more than six to 12 hours ahead of its arrival. Houston’s physical size also makes rain forecasts challenging: Each side of the I-10, for instance—one of several highways that serve as boundaries in an otherwise endless city—might receive a substantially different amount. A good meteorologist is almost always, by definition, skilled at pattern recognition. Weather, like the law, is built on a foundation of similar cases. Veteran meteorologists—Reilly has been in the job for 24 years—mine their memories for analogues. In the early hours of Harvey, Reilly’s team began upping the National Weather Service’s rain forecast to amounts that no one had ever seen: 25 inches, 30, and eventually 50, over a widespread swath of Houston. Reilly set aside everything he knew about the weather and decided to obey the combination of awe and dread he felt in his chest: A killing flood was on its way. Somehow the warnings sounded different coming from him. The next part of the job, and perhaps the more important one, is getting the word out. At a time when the weather can be more extreme than ever, and trust in government is low, convincing people to heed your warnings, especially the most severe of them, might now be the weather forecaster’s harder task. The most serious warning when it comes to rain is called a Flash Flood Emergency, and before Harvey, the Houston office had issued that warning on only three occasions. It would soon be used for a fourth. Berger, sitting behind his Spartan desk that afternoon, anxiety beginning to weigh on him like heat, was first among those who might listen—and to whom others might listen about the coming storm. He wasn’t the government; he was a human being, and somehow the warnings sounded different to their ears coming from him, the kind of measured voice that shines through in a crisis. After he had written his ominous flood forecast three times, he looked out his office window at one of the two garages he keeps. One of them was bursting with new things for his new house, and he began ferrying boxes upstairs to his office, filling the space in front of his desk with new light fixtures, a microwave, and a tub. In between trips, he heard Amanda making arrangements to take shelter, with their daughters, at her sister’s house, built on pilings and tucked away from the wind. Berger would stay. He would hunker down behind his wall of boxes with his PC and his readers, now numbering in the hundreds of thousands, for the duration of the storm. He knew that his city was in serious trouble, and he felt an almost spiritual need to convince his neighbors that it was time for them to share his fears. The weather started making an impression on Berger in 2001, when Tropical Storm Allison came to town. Berger is from Michigan but had gone to the University of Texas to earn his astronomy degree. He moved to Houston for a girl, first working weekends at the Houston Chronicle before becoming the paper’s designated “SciGuy,” writing mostly about physics, chemistry, and astronomy. He also wrote a little about the weather. He had just bought his first house near White Oak Bayou. On June 8, a Friday night—what was it about storms and Friday nights?—he went out with some friends to see a Bob Schneider concert. Allison had passed through Houston once already, but now it returned to take a second run at the city. Berger remembers that the sound of the rain on the roof drowned out Schneider, as though there was too much percussion in the mix. After the concert, he and his friends left to wander around midtown, gawking at the water rising on the empty streets. Berger wrote about the storm. One of his stories, about the drowning deaths of tens of thousands of research animals in the basement of the Texas Medical Center, drew massive national readership. He began having visions—he saw a place for thoughtful written analysis of the weather online. His discussions could be more timely and interactive than the forecasts printed in the paper itself. And unlike TV meteorologists, he needn’t worry about ratings or being available to viewers only at certain designated times. In June 2005, he started his own blog on the Chronicle ’s site. He didn’t yet have any meteorological training; he was just someone who liked talking about the weather. (His colleagues called him “Weather Boy.” It was not a compliment.) Three months later came Katrina. Then came Rita. And three years later, Hurricane Ike. Berger’s life could seem governed by storms; even his first meeting with Amanda, whom he married in 2002, came only a few weeks after Allison’s transformative rains. He convinced the newspaper to put him through a distance learning program at Mississippi State to earn his certification as a professional meteorologist. Modern technology and information dissemination have led to a democratization of weather forecasting, and that could mean compounding disaster in the wrong hands. Berger wanted to make sure his hands were the right ones. When he left the Chronicle to join Ars Technica in October of 2015, he started Space City Weather. The day after he opened up shop, the remnants of Hurricane Patricia began clouding the skies of Houston. He was supposed to go out for dinner with Amanda. He worried his readers would feel he’d abandoned them in a time of need, and he couldn’t help writing a post. His first forecast on Space City Weather was for a flood. Now in August 2017, the rains on Harvey’s opening night shocked even him. They were biblical. Rain falling at a rate of 2 inches an hour would force most drivers to pull over. Harvey would sometimes drop 5. It didn’t look like water; it looked like milk. Worse, Berger studied the models and the satellite imagery, and if he knew anything in that moment, listening to the rain against his window, he knew that there was so much more to come. On Saturday, August 26, an hour after sunset, the evening’s first band of precipitation, which on radar resembled the longest tentacles of an angry squid, opened up over Houston, slowly crossing the city from west to east. As predicted by the European model, it stalled. Additional bands trailing behind it intensified and merged with the first. This created what meteorologists properly call a seething nexus of hate, Berger later wrote. The now-combined band extended more than 400 miles over Galveston and deep into the too-warm waters of the Gulf, creating a superhighway for rain to be delivered directly to Houston. By very early Sunday morning, Harvey’s enormous size began to tell, and another band prepared to make its assault on the already flooded southern suburbs. The Houston branch of the NWS had issued its special emergency bulletin, and in the adjacent Office of Emergency Management, the walls were being papered with calls for water rescues. People were drowning in the rain. A sleepless Berger sat down at his desk and began writing a new post. Amanda and their daughters had been at her sister’s house for several hours, and she texted him to ask if he thought the latest band would be the end of it. He inserted the scene into his piece, which went up at 2:10 am on Sunday morning. I wanted nothing more than to fall in her arms and tell her yes, this was it. By God, yes. Let’s go to bed and forget this ever happened. It had to be it, surely. It would not be it. Harvey would make true Berger’s most pessimistic projections and refuse to leave. He would tell his readers that the rain would continue, especially at night. He would later hear that administrators at the Houston Methodist Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine were among those looking to him for guidance. He would harbor a guilt for delivering bad news for so many. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post that he titled: “Houston, We Will Get Through This.” With the prospect of more rain, you may feel hopeless or helpless, or both. From a mental health standpoint, the uncertainty this brings adds a considerable amount of stress to an already stressful situation. I wish we could tell you when the rains will end, but we can’t. Here’s one thing we are sure of, however. The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. More than a million people would visit Space City Weather on Sunday alone. Hurricane Harvey already had a name. Now it had its face. Harvey’s unrelenting rain left so much underwater—like these orchards in Pecan Grove. On Tuesday evening, more than four days after the rain first started to fall, Berger would finally write: It’s over. He had been nearly perfect in his forecast. It hadn’t been all that windy, so there weren’t many roofs blown off or trees toppled, except in those few cursed places that were also visited by tornadoes. And there wasn’t much local storm surge. The water didn’t come rushing through Houston. It didn’t arrive in walls the way it did in New Orleans with Katrina, one of the reasons Harvey directly killed 68 people, many in their cars, instead of an estimated 1,833 people, many in their beds. Harvey was a cataclysmic rain event, just as Berger had feared. He could have been wrong and his readers would have moved their furniture back downstairs and grumbled about the wasted effort. But he had been right, and thousands of his readers didn’t have a downstairs anymore. A month after the storm, Berger dropped into his Hyundai hybrid and went for a drive. He wanted to see the terrible reality that had accompanied his forecasts, as though he could use the reminder that Harvey really did do what it did, to Houston and to him. By then the last part of weather analysis, the accounting of the aftermath, was nearly complete. It had rained so hard for so long that Houston’s swamps and reservoirs and drainage canals filled up, which meant that the city’s kitchens and living rooms and dens filled up next. Then the water drained away. In the time in between it made an estimated $75 billion in property irreparably wet. He headed south toward Dickinson, one of the worst-hit areas. On some streets, every house had an enormous pile of debris out front—everything that had been inside the house was now outside of it, rotting in the sun. Other streets had been picked clean, and they looked almost normal, except that through their windows, Berger could see that the otherwise pristine-­seeming houses had been stripped down to the studs. There was a photograph that had made the rounds during the storm. It was of the flood-soaked residents of a nursing home, sitting on their loungers and walkers, water up to their chests. It seemed like a macabre piece of surrealist art. On his tour, Berger decided to visit that nursing home, La Vita Bella. Nearly everything that wasn’t human in that photograph was now sitting out in the yard. The lamps, the chairs, and the popcorn machine from that haunting image melted in the piles of sodden sheetrock and carpet, relics of a viral infamy. They were joined by smaller but perhaps more significant losses: a stuffed animal, a deck of playing cards, a broken mirror, a lipstick and a rouge, a large-print copy of Marley &amp; Me. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post titled: ""Houston, We Will Get Through This."" Berger had also lost a book in the flood. Before dawn on Sunday, lightning had lit up the sky, and he could see that water had reached his garages. He had mostly emptied one but not the other—not the one that contained his old things, his diplomas and his Appetite for Destruction poster and his boxes of books. He raced down and lifted up a box from the floor and its bottom fell out. A book titled From Dawn to Decadence by Jacques Barzun dropped into the water and disappeared. Berger had treasured that book, a massive 500-year history of Western civilization. Its French-born author had died in Texas in 2012. Barzun was 104 years old, and the book had been his life’s work. Something about losing that particular book hit Berger harder than it might have. It was a metaphor for how easily even our monuments can be erased. He had written about the loss of that book and other things in a post that went up on Ars Technica early in the morning on August 30, the Wednesday after the storm. The post was titled “This Is Probably the Worst US Flood Storm Ever, and I’ll Never Be the Same.” The cardboard box had failed, he wrote, and the book had dropped into the murk. Almost immediately, a current from the rushing water beyond the garage door pulled the tome away, forever. Damn, I loved that book. An indescribably bad night had just gotten that little bit worse. Berger started receiving emails and notes from his grateful readers. They had saved some of their own treasures because of his warnings, and they felt they had a debt to settle. A copy of From Dawn to Decadence was eventually put into his hands by a stranger, a woman who had attended a talk he had overcome his nerves to give after the storm. That book now sits high and dry on a shelf in his office, a tiny reminder of the things that Harvey had taken, but also a reminder of the things it had delivered. The National Weather Service is part of a necessary and effective meteorological bureaucracy. It is staffed by thousands of people—by good and competent forecasters who care deeply about the weather and its effects on their communities. The NWS can offer its best daily guess, informed by their forecasters’ computer models and professional experiences. It can give warnings and sound alarms. But the NWS can’t talk about the weather the way human beings talk about the weather. It can’t explore each of its uncertainties, almost reveling in the sweeping possibilities of hurricanes and their animal behaviors. It can’t riff. More important, when the weather is at its worst: The National Weather Service can’t comfort. Even though Dan Reilly and his colleagues live and work in greater Houston, even though they were plenty concerned during Harvey for their own families and homes, they can’t issue a bulletin that says, We’re sick and tired of the rain, just like everyone else. They can’t write: The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. Only someone like Eric Berger can do that, providing a weather forecast that includes words like hope or sorry or maybe. Only someone like Eric Berger can employ our best technology in a way that still feels intimate and human-scale, applying the wisdom of satellites to Deb Walters and her doomed party. Only someone like Eric Berger, looking out his window at the rain and willing for it to stop even though he knows that it won’t be stopping anytime soon, can speak to a family watching the water on its torturous rise to their door, the winds threatening the entirety of their lives, and make them feel a little less alone in the storm. Update: After this article went to press, we heard from Deb Walters, one of the many people who sought Berger’s advice just before Hurricane Harvey. Thanks to Berger’s forecasts, Walters decided to cancel a house party she hosts every year for some members of Alcoholics Anonymous and ex-cons. It turned out to be a good call. Although Walters’ house was spared, the surrounding streets flooded, which would have stranded the guests there for three days. “These folks are hysterical,” she said (as in funny and lovable), “but the type of people you invite to a party aren’t necessarily the type of people you want to spend three days with.” She finally hosted the shindig three weeks later, for a smaller crowd. —The Editors Chris Jones is a longtime magazine writer.

RON NIXON,"That left the agency to assume more responsibility, like delivering supplies, a job typically left to the states. Having the agency take on a larger role than what is mandated by the law is never a good situation, Brock Long, the agencys administrator, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee in October 2017. When FEMA is the first and primary responder, and the only responder for many weeks, we are never going to move as fast as anybody would like. Since its founding in 1979, FEMA has been the subject of intense criticism, particularly after its delayed response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The hurricane killed 1,800 and destroyed more than 800,000 housing units, leaving many homeless. The federal government, particularly FEMA, was blamed for many of those issues because the agency underestimated the impact of the storm and did not stock supplies beforehand at designated shelters like the Superdome. In addition, Michael D. Brown, the director of the agency at the time, had relatively little experience dealing with disasters and emergency response. Before joining the Bush administration, he was the commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association and landed his job at FEMA through his friendship with a longtime Bush adviser. That spurred a number of changes at the agency, like mandating that the FEMA chief have experience managing emergencies. The agency also began positioning supplies before natural disasters so that it could get them to those affected faster.","Volunteers inside a Sears store in Chico, Calif., this month helping victims of the Camp Fire receive FEMA aid and other government services.",2018-11-22T17:21:22Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","What FEMA Is Doing, and Not Doing, in Response to California’s Fires",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/us/politics/fema-california-wildfires.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/22/us/politics/22dc-fema1/22dc-fema1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Katrina,1
PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Several news organizations, including The New York Times, conducted independent analyses and found that the number of deaths traceable to the storm was probably far higher than the official count of 64. The Times’s review, based on daily mortality data from Puerto Rico’s vital statistics bureau, found that 1,052 more people than usual had died across the island in the 42 days after Maria struck. The analysis compared daily figures for 2017 with an average of figures for the corresponding days in 2015 and 2016. Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism reached a similar estimate, that 1,065 more people than usual had died in September and October. CNN compiled figures from half the island’s funeral homes to report that funeral directors believed that 499 more deaths than the official count were tied to the hurricane. Methods for counting storm deaths vary by state and locality. In some places, officials include only direct deaths, such as people who drown in storm floodwaters. Puerto Rico’s method is not that restrictive; the medical examiner includes some deaths indirectly caused by a storm, such as suicides. The leading causes of death on the island in September were diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease, Puerto Rican government data show. But there was a sharp spike — by 50 percent — in the number of recorded deaths from sepsis, a complication of severe infection that can be tied to delayed medical care or poor living conditions. Mr. Rosselló had previously said that his government would look into questionably attributed deaths reported by the news media. On Monday he said he welcomed the outside reviews of the death toll, but he cautioned that the government could not adjust its official mortality count based on “statistical analysis.” “Every life is more than a number, and every death must have a name and vital information attached to it, as well as an accurate accounting of the facts related to their passing,” he said. Reviewing the circumstances surrounding each death will require interviewing family members and doctors who signed death certificates to find out if, for example, the heart attack listed as the cause might have been brought on by stress related to the hurricane or might have been fatal because an ambulance could not get through debris-blocked streets to help in time. For weeks after the storm, top leaders of Puerto Rico’s government insisted that its count of the dead was accurate and not significantly low. On Sept. 29, nine days after Maria made landfall, Héctor M. Pesquera, Puerto Rico’s public safety secretary, said he did not think the count would rise by much. Four days later, President Trump visited the island and remarked that the death toll — which officially stood at 16 at the time — was much lower than the 1,833 people who died in 2005 because of Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Pesquera has repeatedly said that Puerto Rico hewed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s protocols for counting storm-related deaths, and has urged families to share information with the authorities about any deaths that may be linked to the storm. “We always expected that the number of hurricane-related deaths would increase as we received more factual information — not hearsay — and this review will ensure we are correctly counting everybody,” Mr. Rosselló said on Monday.

"Michael Waters on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Jose Herrada, an inmate at Floridas Gulf Correctional Institution, first heard news about Hurricane Michael on the radio. Initially, Herrada thought little of it. Although the state of Florida had issued a mandatory evacuation order for nearby Panama City and surrounding areas, officials at Gulf CI hadnt brought up the possibility of evacuating the prisons 1,500 inmates. Herrada assumed that meant he would be safe. We thought [the hurricane] was not coming close when they did not evacuate us, Herrada told Earther by email. If officials at Gulf CI reached a similar conclusion, they were dead wrong. The prison took a direct hit from Hurricane Michael as the historically-powerful storm surged across the Florida Panhandle on October 10th. The damage to was immediate: The facility lost power, and phone lines stopped working. Water started flooding in through cracks along the windows. The wind was so strong that it cleaved off several dormitory roofs and a section of the perimeter fence, according to Herrada and The Miami Herald, and inmates had to rush to keep their belongings dry as water flooded in. Buzzfeed reported that many dorm rooms were destroyed and that some windows were entirely blown off. We were scared, Herrada told Earther. Most of us are scarred emotionally. I myself have nightmares. Although the Florida Department of Corrections evacuated six prisons prior to Hurricane Michaels arrival, Gulf CI is one of a number in the path of the storm were not evacuated in advance. Four days after the storm, on October 14th, Gulf CI and other hard-hit prisons were fully evacuated until further damage assessment can be completed, per the department. Michelle Glady, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections, told Earther the department makes determinations about what facilities should be evacuated in the best interest of public, staff and inmate safety based on wind speed, flooding history, building age, road safety, and other factors. Glady added that much like many North Florida communities, our facilities sustained damage but, in all prisons, our staff and inmates were safe, and no one was injured during the storm. Herrada takes a different view. They took a gamble with our lives, he told Earther. In recent years, a spate of mishandled hurricanes has exposed the failures of the U.S. prison system to account for those it incarcerates during natural disasters. The problem was on full display during the two most destructive hurricanes of 2018. A month before Michael, in September, Hurricane Florence bore down on the Carolinas. While North Carolina and Virginia evacuated prisons under threat, the South Carolina Department of Corrections refused to evacuate facilities that lay within high-risk zones. And climate change, which expected to produce bigger and deadlier storms, could place already-vulnerable incarcerated people in even greater danger. Thats not only because their personal safety is consistently ignored during storms, but also because prisons themselves are often at greater risk from hurricanes than other housing structures. According to Yale researcher Hannah Hauptman, who mapped out prison geographies in a recent paper, prisons are disproportionately located on low-lying land that remains vulnerable to storm impacts, in part because many U.S. prisons are former slave plantations. The state approves of and constructs prisons significantly closer to dangerous floodplains than it does for other forms of settlement, Hauptman notes. Even today, private companies sometimes fail to consider storm risks when choosing the locations for new prisons. Washingtons Northwest Detention Center, which opened in 2004, houses up to 1,575 immigrants in one of the nations riskiest tsunami zones. In the event of a tsunami, according to The Seattle Globalist, the prison will fill with as much as two meters of water in less than eight minutes. (Northwest Detention Center did not immediately return Earthers request for comment.) We tend not to prioritize the needs of people who are incarcerated, Keramet Reiter, a professor of criminology at the University of California Irvine School of Social Ecology, told Earther. In a disaster they are maybe the last priority. The problem is deeply entrenched, beginning with the fact that many prisons do not even have clearly stated emergency evacuation plans during natural disasters, and there is no state or national requirement that they do, as noted in a recent paper by Columbia Law student William Omorogieva. (Some states require other forms of emergency planning, but none mandates plans specific to natural disasters.) Shaundra Young Scott, director of the ACLU in South Carolina, told Earther that part of the issue is funding. Evacuations are expensive, and in South Carolina, where the state has already slashed mental health programs in its prisons in the last eight years, its pretty clear the state legislature is loath to spend money on prisoners, and quite frankly, they arent worried about evacuation because they dont care about prisoners. When voters also tend to lack empathy for people in prison, there is no political will to change the system. Reports of inmates stranded by devastating hurricanes date back to at least 1937, when the Kentucky state reformatory broke into riots after days without drinking water. Following Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans prisoners who were not evacuated smashed windows to let air in as the floodwaters rose, and they lit their shirts on fire so aid workers would know they were trapped. Last year, during Hurricane Harvey, Houston inmates in multiple prisons were left in cells flooded knee-high with water contaminated by urine and feces without enough food or drinking water, according to The Nation. Texas inmate Deidre McDonald wrote for The Marshall Project about waking up to the sound of thunder cracking and officers screaming for everyone to get to the second floor the morning that Harvey made landfall. Though the state had issued an evacuation warning for Dickinson, Texas, where she was held, the prison did not relocate the group of predominantly disabled inmates living there. McDonald noted that her prisonlike so many otherswas structurally unequipped for a dangerous hurricane: Given the way the Texas Department of Criminal Justice built this place, the sidewalks overflow during even the lightest rain, creating a constant slip-and-fall hazard for the predominantly disabled offender population here, McDonald wrote. We tend not to prioritize the needs of people who are incarcerated. In a disaster they are maybe the last priority. Last year, after Hurricane Irma struck her 700-person Miami prison, Homestead Correctional Institute, inmate Natalie Price went two weeks without power. Around her, people were crammed three to a room. Two inches of water lined the floors, Price told Earther, and more leaked in through the walls. All things considered, Price feels the prison administration handled things well for our state emergencymost of the problems, she said, came not from the administration but from the old age of the buildings, which were prone to leaks. Most of the families of inmates around her also didnt understand what was happening, according to Price. Although the state notified them that the Homestead Correctional Institute would be evacuated, it never was. This fall, even Florida prisons located further from the shore than Gulf CIlike Apalachee Correctional Institution, which houses up to 1,300 peoplefelt the effects of Hurricane Michael. Michael Henderson, an inmate at Apalachee CI, told Earther that the prison is so old that even before Hurricane Michael, some windows were broken or outright missing. When the storm arrived, rain rushed in through the open windows, and inmates scrambled to salvage their belongings. For some of us, like myself that meant vital legal work that if destroyed would have left me at a major disadvantage, Henderson said. Yet the worst part was not the flooding itself but the unrest after. Inmates were stuck in lockdown and unable to leave their dorms, Henderson said, recalling that they ate only cold sandwiches served at odd hours. On October 14th, four days after Hurricane Michael, the dorm across from Hendersons broke into a full on free for all that resulted in officers armed with tactical gear detaining inmates. About thirty men were removed and taken to confinement or transferred, Henderson said. (Apalachee CI did not respond to Earthers request for comment on this incident, but verified a near riot over food to the Florida Times Union in October.) The officials knew this hurricane was coming and did little to prepare, Henderson added. The systemic failures of the prison system to account for the people it incarcerates during major storms has not escaped the notice of inmates. Before a hurricane, more experienced inmates often warn newer ones about the unique dangers they face. Back at Gulf CI, Shamar McCullum, another inmate, calls this the talk. McCullum told Earther that a group of older inmates sat him and others down before the storm and warned them that officers may leave to save themselves; that after the hurricane, each person should eat light; and that each inmate should save his most valuable property because it may get flooded out. (According to McCullum, the last two concerns proved to be true.) McCullum also told Earther that, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Michael, he had little access to drinking water because the pipes burst. Food came infrequentlyon the third day, he was fed only one meal. McCullum recalls that when an inmate asked an officer when their meal was coming, the officer responded, Better hope you even get feed at all. Thats when I knew it was not looking good for us, McCullum said. Inmates who asked to be seen by nurses were refused and threatened with disciplinary reports because of the lockdown, according to McCullum. He and the other inmates had no way of communicating with their families, though Gulf CI did relay a message that everyone was OK, McCullum said. They spent long days sitting in their cells without possibility of leaving. When presented with these allegations the Florida Department of Corrections told Earther that although it could not confirm or deny individual claims, all inmates had access to food and drinkable water and medical needs were addressed and prioritized, and inmates have access to routine care. Only two days after Hurricane Michael made landfall, Gulf CI was reduced to such disrepair that the first set of inmates were finally evacuated. Adam Baird, a Gulf CI inmate, said that when the evacuation order finally came, many inmates had gone a day without food. 50 or 60 officers came in around 10:30 pm and told everyone to grab their toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, and deodorant, and tie the rest of our property in a sheet and leave it in the cell, Baird told Earther, recalling the evacuation. McCullum, for one, was relieved. Now that it is all over I still find myself day dreaming about just how bad things could have been if I stayed one more day at that place, he said. What I and the others went through is a experience I dont want anybody thats locked up to go through because officers dont care about inmates, especially at the time of a hurricane. McCullum and the other Gulf CI inmates have been moved to a patchwork of neighboring prisons, including Mayo CI and the Northwest Florida Reception Center. They do not know whenor ifthey will return to Gulf, but because of the damage, they dont expect it will be anytime soon. (Maintenance crews are currently working on repairs, according to the Florida Department of Corrections.) Whether their experiences will propel policy changes remains to be seen. Some researchers, like Omorogieva of Columbia Law, have proposed that FEMA create a special coordinator for incarcerated populations who could craft new requirements to evacuate inmates during natural disasters. There is even a mechanism for doing this: Congress could expand the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which created a Disability Coordinator within FEMA, to also address the needs of incarcerated people. But that requires political will. And although during this years National Prison Strike incarcerated activists highlighted the importance of environmental issues, and a disparate group of protesters convened outside the South Carolina State House to demand evacuations during Hurricane Florence, few lawmakers have even acknowledged the risks that incarcerated populations face during major storms.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/NOAA The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect. The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it? A year of records This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad. There was Harvey, which pummelled the United States in August. It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you'd expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such ""one every 500 years"" flood Houston had suffered in three years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Usually hurricanes might last a day or two, but the torrential rain from Harvey lasted a week. September brought Irma, which devastated Caribbean communities. It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Finally, Hurricane Ophelia span past Portugal and Spain - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ophelia carried Saharan dust as far north as London, darkening the sky in the middle of the day Despite this, 2017 wasn't the worst year in some key respects. It didn't produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph. Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina. But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 racked up $144bn in damage according to the National Hurricane Center - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey's persistent rain caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Texas It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse? There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C. But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there's no clear upward trend. Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years. Saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year. In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. Land drainage High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change. But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago. Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That's likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades. Image copyright EPA Image caption Extreme rainfall events are becoming more common in the US, according to data from the EPA But the location of housing compounded the damage. Houston's population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm's way. Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels.

In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land. A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There's an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Credit Sophia Germer/The Advocate, via Associated Press It has been an election season in which women and minorities have won groundbreaking races across the country. And on Saturday, New Orleans continued the trend, electing its first female mayor, LaToya Cantrell, in the city’s 300-year history. Here are a few things to know about Ms. Cantrell, 45, who with her husband, Jason, has a daughter, RayAnn, 9. Come From Away Ms. Cantrell is neither a New Orleans native nor related to local political royalty, two more ways she departs from precedent in a tradition-loving city. She replaces Mayor Mitch Landrieu, the son of a former mayor and the brother of a former United States senator, who was limited to two terms. Ms. Cantrell, a Democrat, was born in Los Angeles and raised by a social worker mother and a law enforcement-employed stepfather, who left the family when he became addicted to drugs, Ms. Cantrell told NOLA.com. A grandmother took in the young LaToya when her mother could no longer take care of her. Ms. Cantrell, who is black, arrived in New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier University of Louisiana, a historically black college. The Legacy of Katrina Ms. Cantrell gained a political foothold while leading her neighborhood, Broadmoor, to recovery from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The city proposed razing Broadmoor, a majority black, working-class neighborhood that had been inundated by eight to 10 feet of water, and replacing it with a park.

Kevin McGill / AP,"(NEW ORLEANS) — LaToya Cantrell, a City Council member who first gained a political following as she worked to help her hard-hit neighborhood recover from Hurricane Katrina, won a historic election Saturday that made her the first woman mayor of New Orleans. The Democrat will succeed term-limited fellow Democrat Mitch Landrieu as the city celebrates its 300th anniversary next year. “Almost 300 years, my friends. And New Orleans, we’re still making history,” Cantrell told a cheering crowd in her victory speech. The leader in most polls before the runoff election, she never trailed as votes were counted. Her opponent, former municipal Judge Desiree Charbonnet, conceded the race and congratulated Cantrell late Saturday. Later, complete returns showed Cantrell with 60 percent of the vote. “I do not regret one moment of anything about this campaign,” Charbonnet said. The two women led a field of 18 candidates in an October general election to win runoff spots. Landrieu earned credit for accelerating the recovery from Hurricane Katrina in an administration cited for reduced blight, improvements in the celebrated tourism economy and economic development that included last week’s announcement that a digital services company is bringing 2,000 new jobs to the city. But Cantrell will face lingering problems. Crime is one. Another is dysfunction at the agency overseeing the city’s drinking water system and storm drainage — a problem that became evident during serious flash flooding in August. About 32 percent of city voters took part in last month’s election. It was unclear whether turnout would surpass that on Saturday. Cantrell faced questions about her use of a city credit card. Charbonnet had to fight back against critics who cast her as an insider who would steer city work to cronies. Katrina was a theme in the backstories of both candidates. Cantrell moved to the city from California. Her work as a neighborhood activist in the aftermath of Katrina in the hard-hit Broadmoor neighborhood helped her win a seat on council in 2012. Charbonnet, from a well-known political family in New Orleans, was the city’s elected recorder of mortgages before she was a judge. In the campaign she made a point of saying hers was the first city office to re-open after Katrina, providing critical property records to the displaced. Cantrell entered the race as the perceived front-runner, leading in fundraising and in various polls. She had an 11 percentage point lead in a poll released last week by the University of New Orleans. It showed 46 percent of 602 voters surveyed from Nov. 1-8 favored Cantrell over Charbonnet, who had 35 percent; 20 percent were undecided. Former state civil court Judge Michael Bagneris, who finished third in last month’s race, endorsed Cantrell, as did Troy Henry, a businessman who also ran for the post last month. UNO political science professor Edward Chervenak said the endorsements appeared to help Cantrell overcome revelations that she had used her city-issued credit card for thousands of dollars in purchases without clear indications that they were for public purposes. The money was eventually reimbursed but questions lingered about whether she had improperly used city money for personal or campaign expenditures. Voters also made history in a New Orleans City Council race. Cyndi Nguyen defeated incumbent James Gray in an eastern New Orleans district.

MIRIAM JORDAN,"In California, where Operation Streamline is set to begin next month, many migrants awaiting a hearing are being held in detention facilities far from the courts, making it difficult for them to have productive consultations with defense lawyers: They must occur by video. Reuben C. Cahn, the executive director of Federal Defenders of San Diego, said that “providing meaningful representation becomes all but impossible.” “The court has already begun to reshape itself to accommodate the increase in prosecutions, and these accommodations serve to diminish both the court and the constitutional protections accorded the accused,” he wrote in a June 4 letter to Chief Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz of the United States District Court in San Diego. Critics like him also argue that prosecuting illegal migrants en masse clogs courts that should be expending resources to prosecute people for serious crimes such as human trafficking, drug smuggling and prostitution. In the sixth group of migrants before the judge in Arizona that Monday stood Elder Canales, who had lived in New Orleans for more than a decade — long enough to help rebuild the city after Hurricane Katrina and to have a 10-year-old American-born son. The undocumented heavy-equipment operator from Honduras paid taxes in the United States and sent money to his family in his home country, including funds for the burial of two brothers who were murdered by gangs, according to Mr. Miranda, who was representing Mr. Canales. He had had no run-ins with the law. A few months ago, his wife produced a Honduran passport, rather than United States identification, when she was stopped by officers while driving, Mr. Miranda recounted. They did not arrest her, but they jotted down her address. About two weeks later, immigration agents staked out their home and arrested Mr. Canales, who was deported in February.

Associated Press,"(TALLAHASSEE, Fla.) — Florida’s top elections official abruptly resigned Thursday after a newspaper obtained pictures of him in blackface dressed as a Hurricane Katrina victim at a 2005 party.
Secretary of State Michael Ertel, who had been on the job less than three weeks, resigned just hours after he testified about election lawsuits before a state legislative committee.
The Tallahassee Democrat obtained pictures taken at a Halloween party 14 years ago that show Ertel dressed in blackface while wearing earrings, a New Orleans Saints bandanna and fake breasts under a purple T-shirt with “Katrina Victim” written on it. The photos were taken two months after the deadly storm ravaged the Gulf Coast region and eight months after Ertel was appointed Seminole County supervisor of elections. The newspaper hasn’t said how it got the photos or identified the source.
Ertel was the Seminole elections supervisor until new Gov. Ron DeSantis picked him last month to take over the department that oversees elections.
DeSantis said Ertel regretted dressing up in blackface, but he said that he was right to step down after the pictures emerged.
“I want people to be able to lead and not have any of these things swirling around,” said DeSantis, who was in Marianna to discuss hurricane relief efforts for areas hit hard by Hurricane Michael in October.
Ertel was appointed Seminole elections supervisor by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in February 2005 and won four elections to keep the office.
Ertel played a role in DeSantis’ decision to suspend Palm Beach County supervisor of elections Susan Bucher last week. Ertel recommended the governor take action against the Democratic official, contending that she had violated state election laws and was incompetent. Democrats have sharply criticized Bucher’s suspension as being politically motivated.
DeSantis last year defeated Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who was seeking to become Florida’s first black governor. Gillum questioned DeSantis’ association with people seen as racially divisive. DeSantis also came under fire for a comment he made in late August where he said that Florida voters shouldn’t “monkey this up” by supporting Gillum.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday as the worst storm ever to hit that region and the third most intense hurricane to ever slam into the continental United States, with its minimum pressure recorded at 919 millibars (mb) on Wednesday afternoon. Michael was a Category 4 hurricane at landfall, with sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (249 km per hour). The lower the minimum pressure, the more intense the hurricane. Here are five of the most powerful hurricanes to make landfall in the mainland United States based on minimum pressure: - Florida Keys Labor Day hurricane, 1935, 892 mb The hurricane struck the Florida Keys as a Category 5, the highest ranking possible. It killed more than 200 World War One veterans who were in the Keys to build a highway. It generated wind speeds of up to 200 miles per hour (322 km per hour). After ravaging the Keys, the storm moved north off the western coast of Florida before turning inland. In all, more than 400 people died in Florida. - Hurricane Camille, 1969, 900 mb Camille struck the Mississippi Gulf Coast as a Category 5 hurricane, bringing with it devastating storm tides and strong winds that demolished buildings and destroyed orchards. More than 200 people were killed. - Hurricane Katrina, 2005, 920 mb The hurricane made a direct hit on New Orleans as a Category 3 storm, causing levees and flood walls to fail in dozens of places. Most of New Orleans was flooded, and some people who were stranded in their homes climbed to the roofs to await rescue. About 1,200 people died, according to the National Weather Service. Most victims were in Louisiana, but neighboring Mississippi also was hard hit. Katrina caused an estimated $108 billion in damage, making it the costliest hurricane ever to strike the United States. - Hurricane Andrew, 1992, 922 mb The hurricane struck South Miami-Dade County in Florida and caused an estimated $26 billion in damage. That ranked as the most expensive storm in U.S. history, until Hurricane Katrina inundated New Orleans and pummeled other parts of the U.S. South in 2005. More than a dozen people were directly killed by the storm in Florida, with others dying of indirect causes. - The Indianola, Texas hurricane, 1886, 925 mb The hurricane destroyed the Texas town of Indianola, which at the time was vying with Galveston to become the state’s main port. Several dozen people were killed in the storm, which also ended a catastrophic drought in the region.

Nichola Groom,"(Reuters) - In 2006, a year after hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, the U.S. government struck a deal to give states in the region a growing share of offshore drilling revenues to finance projects protecting them from future monster storms. 
But revenues have fallen short of forecasts by half, leaving Louisiana with a gap in financing for a $50 billion plan for projects to raise levees, build flood gates, widen evacuation routes and protect its eroding coastline. 
The shortfall, which federal officials blame on low oil prices, has forced the state to put off critical projects as Louisiana’s congressional delegation pushes for another increase in its share of federal oil revenues. 
The predicament shows how states hosting offshore drilling can get burned by the industry’s boom-and-bust cycles, providing a cautionary tale for other states as the Trump administration proposes to expand offshore drilling in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans. 
Louisiana’s underfinanced coastal projects also highlight the hefty cost of adapting to rising sea levels in a changing climate a problem scientists blame on consumption of fossil fuels. Several coastal states including Florida, Massachusetts, California, and Washington have urged the administration to leave them out of its drilling plans, arguing the environmental costs outweigh the promised jobs and income. 
The stakes are particularly high for Louisiana, which has lost about 2,000 square miles of land over the last century because of Mississippi River levees that block silt from reaching its swamps, the oil industry’s carving of canals through the marshes, and sea level rise from climate change. 
But other states and nations should take notice of Louisiana’s ordeal, said U.S. Representative Garret Graves, a Republican who managed the state’s coastal restoration efforts before joining Congress in 2014. 
“What in Louisiana is a $50 or $70 billion problem, you are talking hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars around the United States and around the world,” he said. 
FAULTY PROJECTIONS 
President George W. Bush signed the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) into law in December of 2006, providing storm-battered Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama a 37.5 percent share of federal oil-and-gas royalties from offshore drilling. 
Previously, Gulf Coast states got 27 percent of revenues from federal leases within three miles of their seaward boundaries. 
The changes followed national outrage over the administration’s botched emergency response to catastrophic flooding from the systematic failure of the federally constructed levee system in New Orleans. 
Six months earlier, the chief of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers admitted the agency had “missed something” in engineering the system, which collapsed at water levels lower than they were designed to withstand. 
For the first ten years, the changes applied to only a fraction of offshore leases. But after that, in larger payouts starting last year, it applied to all offshore leases off the coasts of these states. 
In 2013, the Department of Interior told Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas that, under the second phase, they would have at least $375 million to split between them annually through 2055. 
But when the states’ first payment came in late last year, the payout totaled $188 million. 
“That has a huge impact on our planning efforts,” said Chip Kline, chair of the state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, which oversees its 50-year, $50 billion coastal restoration plan. 
Another GOMESA recipient, Alabama, has also felt the pinch. Its Republican governor, Kay Ivey, wrote a letter to then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in March 2018 urging him to support states seeking more offshore revenues. 
“Expanded and enhanced revenue sharing will allow states to more properly address the coastal impacts of offshore production,” she wrote. 
An official for the Texas General Land Office said the lower payouts had not impacted its programs because it had budgeted conservatively. Officials in Mississippi did not respond to requests for comment. 
Department of Interior officials said the shortfall was due to a sharp drop in oil prices since 2013. It would not provide the underlying oil price or production estimates it used in its 2013 projections, saying they were supplied by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and were confidential. 
OMB did not respond to a Reuters request for the data. 
In an emailed statement, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said the bureau no longer provides long-term projections for state revenue from the program. 
OUTSIZED IMPACT 
The shortfall had an outsized impact on Louisiana, which receives almost half the GOMESA program’s revenues because of its geographic proximity to the largest number of offshore wells. It received $82 million in its first phase-two payout, compared to the $177 million it had been counting on. 
Among the shortfall’s biggest impacts, Kline said, would be a delay in completing the state’s massive “Morganza to the Gulf” hurricane protection project, a system of levees and floodgates to protect 150,000 coastal residents of Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes from a so-called 100-year storm, defined as having a 1 percent chance of hitting in any given year. 
Lafourche parish is a major seafood and oil industry hub that includes Port Fourchon, the land base for offshore oil and gas services companies. Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes could each lose about 40 percent of their land area in the next 50 years in the absence of effective coastal protection measures, according to state research. 
The Morganza project has been in the works for more than a decade and is expected to cost about $2 billion. Local communities have already agreed to tax increases twice to help fund the unfinished project. 
“We’ve been piecemealing this,” said Reggie Dupre, executive director of the Terrebonne Levee and Conservation District. 
The funding gap also forced state officials to cancel a plan to funnel 10 percent of offshore oil revenue to help finance road improvements along hurricane evacuation routes. 
St. Bernard Parish, which was devastated by flooding after Hurricane Katrina, has its own $1 billion coastal plan, with $600 million in projects ready to move forward. 
It received $781,000 from the 2018 payments, according to John Lane, coastal manager for the parish. 
“There just isn’t enough money coming in,” Lane said. 
LEGISLATIVE PUSH 
While Louisiana officials piece together funding for their projects from other sources, its legislators in Congress are fighting for changes to GOMESA, including increasing the percentage diverted to states from 37.5 percent to 50 percent. 
One such bill, sponsored by Congressman Graves, passed a vote in the House Committee on Natural Resources late last year, before the new Congress was seated. 
FILE PHOTO: A drilling platform is seen near Breton Island, Louisiana May 3, 2010. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo
But the idea faces resistance from those who believe the revenues should be used on national instead of state priorities. Both President Donald Trump and President Barack Obama’s administrations had proposed budgets eliminating or reducing GOMESA payments to finance federal programs instead, before being pushed back by Congress. 
Graves says increasing the revenue share would be a smart move for an administration promoting more offshore drilling. 
“Are you really going to treat (host states) poorly and not reward them, or not keep them happy and healthy so they can continue being productive?” Graves said.

Marcus Gilmer,"With a monster hurricane spinning towards the east coast, President Donald Trump took a moment during a briefing on Tuesday to herald the awful, delayed response to 2017's Hurricane Maria as an ""unsung success,"" sparking outrage online. Calling it ""one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about,"" Trump is ignoring what was, in fact, a dreadful response that cost more lives than what the storm death toll originally claimed. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is on its way to the East Coast. Here's what to expect. At the time, the administration committed to a more aggressive response to storms that struck Texas, even as that situation there became more manageable and Puerto Rico desperately needed more assistance. But perhaps worst of all is the fact that Trump is using words like ""tremendous"" and ""success"" to describe a response to a storm that ultimately killed almost 3,000 people, more than the roughly 1,800 killed by Hurricane Katrina and about the same number of people who were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As far as Trump's response is concerned, the most lasting image of his involvement with Hurricane Maria will be the time he visited Puerto Rico and threw rolls of paper towels to survivors. As one could imagine, Trump's egregiously tone-deaf statement on Tuesday did not go over well on Twitter. Trump simply does not get it. Thus his neglect towards Puerto Rico cost about 3,000 lives.

"AJ Willingham, CNN","(CNN) Rebuilding is not a glamorous process, and it's far from an easy one. Though Hurricane Florence has passed, the road ahead for survivors will take years to traverse, with innumerable questions and challenges along the way. The only way to really know what this journey is like is to hear about it from others who have made it through a similar catastrophe. Ron Magill is a wildlife expert, communications director and goodwill ambassador of Zoo Miami. He and the majority of the zoo's animals survived Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Colette Bennett is a writer and New Orleans-area native who was living in the city when Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005. Their stories can provide a road map for those rebuilding after Florence, from the big-picture basics that need immediate solutions to the long-term emotional tests they will face. This is the first and most crucial question of a hurricane survivor's journey: Return home, or go somewhere else? The lucky will be able to live in their own houses. But water damage, mold and contamination could render others unlivable for months. For the thousands of Florence survivors who can't go home yet and can't stay with family or friends, the next few months may be spent adrift: in FEMA shelters, in temporary housing or in motels. Even if a house is still standing and the neighborhood is safe, there's no guarantee survivors will have access immediately to the basic comforts of home. Houses could be without running water, or without water that's safe to drink. When Hurricane Andrew hit, Ron Magill's Miami house was mostly spared. But he had no electricity for almost two weeks. Magill used a generator to keep the fridge going, as well as a fan for his wife, who was nine months pregnant in the late summer heat. ""Andrew was a great equalizer,"" he says. ""If you lived in a $200,000 home or a $50,000 home, it didn't matter. You still didn't have power. Everybody needed water, everybody needed the same things, so the overwhelming majority of people came together to help each other."" Andrew was a dry storm -- swift and furious, with most of the damage owing to intense winds. It's equally challenging when it's a slow, sodden slog, like Florence or Katrina. Do I even want to stay here? In the days before Katrina hit, Colette Bennett packed a duffel bag and evacuated New Orleans to Houston with some friends. They all thought they'd be gone just a few days. Then, their hosts flipped on the TV. ""You all better come here,"" they said. Levees across the region had crumbled. ""I don't remember the images but the words,"" Bennett recalled. ""I remember them saying the mayor had declared the city closed. They didn't know when it would reopen."" ""So, in that moment,"" she said, ""we all basically became homeless."" Bennett would learn later her mother and grandmother had to be airlifted out of the hotel where they had gone to escape the storm. It took months for the pair to get back to their home in Chalmette, Louisiana. Bennett chose a different path. She was in her 20s and didn't own a home. ""FEMA gave $2,000 to each of us to get our lives restarted,"" she said. With $8,000 among them, she and three friends drove to California and rented a house. She didn't return to New Orleans for four years. How am I going to fix everything that's broken? After basic safety and living situations are set, it's time to start picking up the pieces -- literally. Barely days after the worst of hurricanes Harvey and Irma passed in 2017, residents were busy salvaging what they could and hauling the rest to the curb. After natural disasters, piles of debris are an inevitable hallmark. Things were especially bad after Andrew's winds scattered everything in sight. ""There were no trees, no fences,"" Magill said. At the local airport, he said, ""there were airplanes wrapped around trees like tissue paper."" ""It's just unbelievable to see that kind of power."" Residents jokingly named the garbage heaps ""Mount Trashmore."" It can take weeks -- months, even -- and tens of millions of dollars to clear it all out. How am I going to pay for this? Standing in an empty house as its useless guts bake on the front lawn, Florence survivors will undoubtedly ask themselves, time and time again, ""Who is going to pay for all this?"" One of the first pieces of advice financial experts give natural disaster survivors is to contact insurance companies and prepare claims as soon as possible. Homeowner's insurance, flood insurance, FEMA claims -- all of them require documentation. Even if important papers have been lost to the flood, calling insurance companies and giving them relevant information can at least get the ball rolling. Bennett's family home in Chalmette was below sea level. After the storm, it was completely submerged. The house had to be demolished. ""(FEMA) gave my grandmother money to rebuild,"" Bennett said. ""She did not use it and put it in a savings (account). After five years, FEMA called and asked how much she had left. When she told them she had it all, FEMA gave her more and said, 'Please build it.' So, she got a brand-new house."" Where will my kids go to school? Eventually the expectations of everyday life come calling. People have to go to work, children have to go back to school -- but where? Storm survivors may find themselves out of work -- temporarily or not -- and forced to dip into savings intended for other priorities, like a child's education. When will I be done rebuilding? Rebuilding is more than fixing houses and shoring up neighborhoods. Routine parts of life suddenly become logistical puzzles. How, for example, will survivors get around if their vehicles were damaged, especially in places where most people don't use public transit? The math often is not pretty, and solving it is just one more roadblock on the path to normalcy. Weeks can stretch into years before it all falls into place. After Andrew, the storm-damaged Zoo Miami and its staff and animals became media sensations. People sent hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations. Along with that came truckloads and private planes full of food, ice and supplies that Magill and his staff eventually shared with other survivors in need. Despite -- and perhaps a bit because of -- the overwhelming support, the zoo felt pressure to reopen as quickly as possible. ""Everyone was so caught up in the recovery and the rebuilding,"" Magill said. Yet when it did reopen, a mere four months after Andrew struck, ""it was a shell of what it once was."" Over the years, the zoo returned to and arguably surpassed its former glory. But it became a perfect example of how, despite copious amounts of support, donations, wishes and prayers, rebuilding can't be rushed. Will things ever be the same? As things fall into place, Florence survivors may wonder why it doesn't all feel normal again. Ask those whose lives have been touched by such a disaster, and they'll tell you ""normal"" isn't exactly the right word. ""Nothing really gets back to normal,"" Magill said. While he and his wife still live in the same house where they sheltered from Andrew's gales, it now has reinforced windows and a healthy stock of emergency supplies. He keeps a land-based telephone line and bought his mother a generator for extra safety. It's not fear, Magill said. That's not how the people of South Florida -- or New Orleans or Houston or the Carolinas -- do things. It's more of a heightened sense of preparedness, of knowing that the worst really is possible. Cities, too, bear permanent scars. When Bennett moved back to New Orleans four years after Katrina, it was a shock. ""The street I grew up on was hard to recognize because huge trees were torn down and houses were bulldozed or in shambles. Entire strip malls, huge buildings were gone. Many people did not return,"" she said. ""It had a gutted feeling."" Twelve years after the storm, Bennett said that while her mother found the hope to process her grief, her grandmother still suffers from post-traumatic stress and anxiety and has found it hard to move on. Recovery, Magill says, is possible. ""We thought there was no way we would ever recover from that hurricane,"" he said. ""But you'd be surprised at what you can do when you're faced with doing it.""

RICHARD GOLDSTEIN,"The team began a revival under Mr. Benson, who hired the seasoned football men Jim Mora as head coach and Jim Finks as general manager. They reached the playoffs four times in the late 1980s and early 1990s, though they lost each time in a wild-card game. Then came Hurricane Katrina in 2005, devastating New Orleans and bringing extensive damage to the Superdome, which was converted to a shelter for thousands of people who were displaced. Mr. Benson had already been unhappy over the Saints’ financial situation in a relatively small-market N.F.L. city that had few major corporations for sponsorships. Then Hurricane Katrina forced the Saints to move their home games out of New Orleans — they played in Baton Rouge, La.; in San Antonio; and at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. With the future of the city itself uncertain, Mr. Benson considered moving the team permanently to San Antonio, an idea that was not embraced. And so he became a villain. But he was back in the fans’ favor when he ultimately agreed to remain in town, gaining a favorable deal with the state of Louisiana to continue playing at the Superdome, which later underwent a substantial renovation at taxpayer expense. Photo Mr. Benson celebrating a 23-3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in 2006. It was the first N.F.L. game played at the Superdome in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Credit Chris Graythen/Getty Images The Saints, led by their quarterback, Drew Brees, and coached by Sean Payton, finally won a Super Bowl championship after the 2009 season, defeating the Indianapolis Colts, 31-17. Then came another crisis for the franchise: Bountygate, a scheme in which players were given cash payments to injure opposing players, forcing them out of the game. An N.F.L. inquiry determined in March 2012 that at least one former assistant coach was involved in the arrangement, which began in 2009. The league said that Mr. Benson had directed the team’s general manager, Mickey Loomis, to end the scheme, but “the evidence showed that Mr. Loomis did not carry out Mr. Benson’s directions.” Mr. Payton was banned for the 2012 season, and the players found to be involved were fined. Mr. Benson apologized to the league. But he remained upbeat. “I’m 85 years old; I’ve been in business since I was a teenager practically; I was in grade school and I even had a paper route,” he told The New York Times after Mr. Payton was reinstated in January 2013. “When we had to get out of here to go to San Antonio, we met with the mayor, and the next day we moved to the Alamodome, with offices set up in the basement.” “Listen, this is all part of life,” he said. “You’ve got to enjoy every day and make the best of it and go forward. That’s what we’re doing.” There was turmoil anew in January 2015, when Mr. Benson fired his estranged daughter from his first marriage, Renee Benson LeBlanc, and her children, Rita and Ryan LeBlanc, from executive positions with the Saints and Pelicans and said he no longer wanted them to inherit shares in the teams, which they had been given through a family trust. He planned to provide them instead with compensation for the shares based on the teams’ valuation. He said he intended to leave the teams to his third wife, Gayle, whom he had married in 2004. Mr. Benson’s daughter, who had been the Saints’ and Pelicans’ executive vice president, and the two grandchildren, who had lesser executive roles, filed a lawsuit in a Louisiana court, seeking to invalidate the firings on the grounds that Mr. Benson was mentally impaired and had been unduly influenced by his wife. They also sued in federal court over Mr. Benson’s attempt to alter the terms of the trust. A judge hearing the state case upheld the firings, acting on findings by psychiatrists who found that Mr. Benson was mentally capable though sometimes forgetful. Mr. Benson and his once presumptive heirs reached an undisclosed financial settlement over the trust in February 2017. His wife remained the future owner of his teams. Photo Mr. Benson in 2010 with the Lombardi Trophy, which the Saints won by defeating the Indianapolis Colts in the Super Bowl. Credit Dave Martin/Associated Press Mr. Benson extended his sports ownership to pro basketball in 2012 when he reached an agreement to buy the New Orleans Hornets for a payment of $338 million to the N.B.A., which had taken over the team. He later renamed them the Pelicans, for Louisiana’s state bird, and the franchise stabilized. Forbes magazine estimated the net worth for Mr. Benson and his family at $2.8 billion in 2017 and said he was the richest person in Louisiana. It valued his Saints at $2 billion and the Pelicans at $750 million. Mr. Benson had several stints as chairman of the N.F.L. owners’ finance committee. He also invested in real estate; he bought an office building next to what is now the Mercedes-Benz Superdome and renamed it the Benson Tower. Thomas Milton Benson Jr. was born on July 12, 1927, to Thomas and Carmelite Benson. After serving in the Navy, he studied accounting at Loyola University in New Orleans, then became a salesman at a Chevrolet dealership there. He later moved to San Antonio to help turn around a troubled dealership and eventually owned many dealerships in the two cities. He also purchased banks, then merged them into Benson Financial, a holding company, in 1994. He sold it to the Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1996. Mr. Benson and his third wife, the former Gayle Marie LaJaunie Bird, founded GMB Racing, a thoroughbred breeding farm in Paris, Ky., named for her, in 2014. Their colts Mo Tom and Tom’s Ready, both named for Mr. Benson, finished eighth and 12th in the 2016 Kentucky Derby. Mr. Benson pledged $11 million to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, in 2014, most of it going for the expansion of its stadium, which is now named for him. He joined with his wife in making extensive donations to educational institutions and charitable endeavors, among them many Roman Catholic entities. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI presented Mr. Benson and his wife with the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal for outstanding service to the church and the pontiff, the highest papal award granted to laypeople. In addition to his wife and his daughter Renee — one of three children from his first marriage, to Shirley Landry, who died in 1980 — Mr. Benson’s survivors include three grandchildren. His son, Robert, and his daughter Jeanne Marie, both from his first marriage, died before him, as did his brothers, Larry, Jerome and A. C. He also had four stepchildren, Don, Ricky and Susan Walker, and Mimi Peake, from his marriage to his second wife, the former Grace Trudeau, who died in 2003. When Mr. Benson’s daughter and her children sued him in 2015, he issued a statement stating that “their allegations regarding my mental health are completely meritless and their allegations against my wife equally unfounded,” and insisted he would not forsake his ownership duties even though he was in his late 80s. As he put it: “There is a small sign that sits on my desk and simply states, ‘Tough times never last; but tough people do.’ Make no mistake, I will be back in the office tomorrow morning working hard, as I do every day.” Continue reading the main story","A colorful self-made billionaire, Mr. Benson was alternately revered and reviled in New Orleans, where he reigned for four decades.",2018-03-15T23:56:16Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Tom Benson, Owner of the Saints and Pelicans, Dies at 90",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/obituaries/tom-benson-dead.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/16/obituaries/16benson1/16benson1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Katrina,1

CAITLIN DICKERSON,"Puerto Rico was already struggling with an increase in mental illness amid a 10-year recession that brought soaring unemployment, poverty and family separation caused by emigration. Public health officials and caregivers say that Maria has exacerbated the problem. Photo A photo of Ms. Serrano Ortiz with her two oldest children. Her home flooded up to the ceiling during the hurricane. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Many Puerto Ricans are reporting intense feelings of anxiety and depression for the first time in their lives. Some are paranoid that a disaster will strike again. And people who had mental illnesses before the storm, and who have been cut off from therapy and medication, have seen their conditions deteriorate. “When it starts raining, they have episodes of anxiety because they think their house is going to flood again,” said Dr. Carlos del Toro Ortiz, the clinical psychologist who treated Ms. Serrano Ortiz. “They have heart palpitations, sweating, catastrophic thoughts. They think ‘I’m going to drown,’ ‘I’m going to die,’ ‘I’m going to lose everything.’ ” With hurricane nearly two months in the past, the island is still in shock. Its residents are haunted by dozens of deaths caused by the storm, and many more life-threatening near misses. The reminders are inescapable. They lie in piles of rotting debris as tall as homes that still line many streets and in cellphones that are useless for checking on family members. Returning to a routine is the most important step toward overcoming trauma, according to physicians and public health officials. But for most Puerto Ricans, logistical barriers like scarce water and electricity, as well as closed schools and businesses, make that impossible. Since Sept. 20, when the storm came ashore at 6:15 a.m., more than 2,000 calls have overwhelmed an emergency hotline for psychiatric crises maintained by the Puerto Rican health department — double the normal number for that period of time, even though most residents still do not have working phones. Puerto Rican officials said that suicides had increased — 32 have been reported since the storm — and many more people than normal have been hospitalized after being deemed dangerous to themselves or others. At the emergency health clinic in Toa Baja, where Ms. Serrano Ortiz lives, Dr. Toro said that he had been frantically calling for help from colleagues in other cities because the facility was overrun with people in need of mental health care. Because it is in a flood zone, Toa Baja was one of the worst affected areas in Puerto Rico. At least four people died there and water levels peaked at more than 12 feet. The city of 80,000 west of San Juan flooded multiple times, each time that it rained after Maria passed. Photo Dr. Carlos del Toro Ortiz met with a patient at the emergency clinic in Toa Baja. Mental health experts fear that Puerto Rico is approaching a crisis. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times In his nearly 20 years of practicing medicine, Dr. Toro said he had never before hospitalized as many people with suicidal or homicidal thoughts in such a short time period. Of about 2,500 people who had been to the clinic since it opened two weeks earlier, more than 90 percent were referred for mental health screenings, Dr. Toro said. He and other practitioners at the clinic had already referred at least 20 people to psychiatric wards elsewhere on the island. “This is an emergency situation,” he said. “It’s still affecting us. There are people that we haven’t seen.” Health workers are bracing for effects similar to those seen in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, where cases of both moderate and severe psychiatric illnesses spiked. In New Orleans, many people experienced insomnia, cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss, which became known colloquially and among researchers as “Katrina Brain.” Prolonged losses of electricity, water communications or infrastructure have been linked to the onset of mental health crises, said Dr. Domingo Marqués, the director of clinical psychology at Albizu University, a prominent graduate school of psychology on the island with clinics in two major cities. All of those elements have been relentlessly present in Puerto Rico. “And this is all happening at once,” he said. “What we have lost is the foundation that holds a society together.” He said that Puerto Ricans would have to adjust their definition of normalcy in order to function: “It’s ‘I survived. My family didn’t die.’ That’s the new definition of O.K.” This hurricane season has caused mental distress, and strained resources for treating it, throughout the Caribbean, according to reports from the U n ited States Virgin Islands, Dominica and Antigua. Photo Laura Rodriguez relied on a strict daily routine to manage her borderline personality disorder, a routine upended by Hurricane Maria. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times The mental health division of the Puerto Rican health department received $3 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate a response to Maria, said Suzanne Roig, the administrator of the Puerto Rican agency. Its doctors have been knocking on doors in the worst-hit parts of the island and visiting emergency shelters where people who lost their homes have been living. “We are trying to reach people to tell them that this crisis will pass,” she said, “and that they should not make permanent decisions.” The agency also started an initiative to monitor social media, and staged interventions in a handful of homes of people who posted what appeared to be suicide notes. During high-volume hours, its staff members have been taking on extra shifts and working overtime to respond to the increase in phone calls to the 24-hour emergency crisis hotline. In addition to struggling with their own emotions, Ms. Roig said that distressed callers had reported children who had not spoken since the storm or cried inconsolably when it rained. And people with serious mental illnesses who had experienced psychotic episodes had been locked inside rooms by family members who did not know what else to do. “People who have a prescription can’t get to a pharmacy,” Ms. Roig said. “If they can get to the pharmacy it might not be open. If it’s open, they might not have the medicine.” Before the storm, Laura Rodriguez, 39, managed her borderline personality disorder without medication by relying on a strict routine: Early morning CrossFit workouts, long hours at work as an interior designer, going to bed early and never having guests at her home in Río Piedras. But since Maria hit, her gym had been closed and her therapist had not been working. Neither had she. “I’m constantly anxious,” she said. “I get these urges to be violent and I can’t control it.” Memories of the storm were also tormenting her. She had been trapped inside her apartment for two days with her boyfriend, her mother and her mother’s cat. They used plastic tarps, towels, bedsheets and pieces of wood to try to plug the windows where rain water was surging through. Without access to any of the balms that she typically relied on to stabilize her mood, she was worried about resorting to self-harm, an impulse that she had struggled to control since she was 8 years old. “What if it’s like three months, four months?” she said. “I cannot do this for so long.” For Ms. Serrano Ortiz, another threat to her mental and physical health loomed. Before the storm, a scan of her throat had indicated that she may have cancer for the second time. But she has not been able to get any more information about her prognosis because her doctor’s offices have been closed. At the emergency clinic, she told Dr. Toro that she might not have the energy to fight the disease again. When she looked in the mirror, she said, she saw in herself a reflection of her home — something dirty, smelly and tainted. “I don’t feel like myself anymore,” she said.

Tom McKay,"In mid-January, the Hawaiian state Emergency Management Agency sent out an erroneous text to all cell phones in the state warning of a “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII,” sending many residents into an hour-long panic as they ran for cover from what they feared was a North Korean nuclear bomb. Though it first appeared that bad design in the EMA computer system which sent out the alert was to blame, federal investigators later said the alert was intentionally sent by a now-fired employee who mistook an ongoing drill for a real attack. The incident did massive damage to the credibility of the emergency alert system, and risked Hawaiians ignoring any potential future alarms sent out if North Korea or anyone else actually does launch a missile at the Aloha State. The EMA’s director has since resigned. So it’s perhaps not surprising that some legislators want to take the responsibility out of the hands of state governments entirely. Sens. Brian Schatz, Kamala Harris, and Cory Gardner have introduced bipartisan legislation titled the Authenticating Local Emergencies and Real Threats, which is intended to make the federal government the sole authority on the matter. Per a press release from Schatz’s office, the ALERT Act would “restrict the authority to alert the public of a missile threat to the federal government,” with only the Federal Emergency Management Agency allowed to send such alerts via its Integrated Public Alert and Warning System. The legislation also would “require FEMA to establish a process to promptly notify state authorities when a missile alert is issued so they can activate their own protective action plans to ensure public safety.” “States are laboratories of democracy,” Schatz quipped in the statement. “They should not be the laboratories of missile alerts. The people who know first should be the people who tell the rest of us. This legislation makes clear that the authority to send missile alerts rests with the federal government.” According to Hawaii Now, Schatz says U.S. Pacific Command currently has to liaise with the state government to send out an alert, while the legislation would allow it to send alerts directly through the Department of Defense. The interim director of the EMA, Brig. Gen. Moses Kaoiwi Jr., told Hawaii Now that he was open to considering the proposal. However, Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim told the station he was wary the federal government lacks “site specific information” necessary to coordinate a response to any potential disaster and that he hopes local governments would be allowed to send follow-up messages. FEMA has a mixed track record, however. It faced massive criticism for the federal government’s response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and most recently, the agency stands accused of bungling millions of dollars in contracts for disaster relief in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","As Hurricane Michael whirled toward Florida over a week ago, Meg Baldwin went into overdrive. As executive director of Refuge House, which works to end domestic violence in the Big Bend, she had to ensure her organization was ready for what she knew was coming: increased calls to their hotline, and a spike in urgent need for shelter from survivors and victims. Baldwins expectation didnt come out of nowhere. When disaster strikes, domestic violence followsnot just in Florida but around the world, according to the World Health Organization. The violence can take many forms, from child abuse to sexual violence to intimate partner violence. People like Baldwin have seen it all firsthand before. And with residents of the Panhandle still reeling from Michaels destruction, there are already signs that the cycle of violence could repeat itself. Weather events like these and disasters, in general, are opportunities for abusersboth domestic violence attackers and sexual assault perpetratorsto take advantage of the restrictive access survivors have to resources and to also take advantage of the isolation in the aftermath survivors experience, Baldwin told Earther. That isolation becomes even more intense and is even more of an opportunity for attackers to harm others. A considerable number of hotline calls came in before the storm in the eight northern Florida counties Refuge House serves, including hard-hit Wakulla and Gadsden counties, said Baldwin. People, largely women, were seeking immediate shelter (both from the storm and their abuser), and the Houses two emergency shelter locations were overcapacity by the time Hurricane Michael made landfall October 10 as a Category 4 storm. The shelters held more than 60 women between the two, compared with the usual 35 to 40, said Baldwin. A 20-person addition might not sound like a lot, but it is for this rural region. With the storm hitting those communities, it means that already-isolated victims are even more isolated. It means the resources of law enforcement intended for their protection has been sent to other needs. Escaping abusers is key during disasters because studies show that violence grows more severe in relationships that already experience it and its prevalence increases across the board, said Jennifer First, a mental health program manager at the Disaster and Community Crisis Center at the University of Missouri whos done extensive research in this area. And one doesnt need to look far back in the history books for proof. Take Hurricane Harvey, which struck Houston in August 2017. The number of domestic violence victims who sought help between January and August from the Crisis Center at the Katy Christian Ministries, which serves the West Houston area, more than doubled from 417 in 2017 to 1,025 this year. Reports of sexual abuse the center received nearly tripled, according to a report the center released earlier this week. For Hurricane Maria, the deadliest storm in modern U.S. history, the situation didnt look much better. Lack of power threatened the elderly and sick who needed machines for their medicine, but this darkness also left abuse survivors and victims on the island vulnerable, as Refinery 29 reported. After the storm, local nonprofit ESCAPE saw requests for survivor-related services increase by 62 percent. A similar spike in domestic violence has been documented after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. For some, this abuse can be deadly: Nearly half of all female homicide victims are killed by a current or former intimate partner, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly one in five women and about one in seven men report having experienced severe physical violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime, per the CDC. Women of color are especially at risk. Why? A lot of the data points to stress. She may have fewer housing choices, First said. She may have less social support. These are all risks that are often associated with domestic violence. After disasters like hurricanes strike, communities are more likely to experience employment loss, displacement, loss of housing, and financial issues. All this is especially true for communities of color and low-income neighborhoods already experiencing these inequalities. (Michael struck the states poorest region.) Even without a natural disaster, economic and housing challenges can increase the risk of domestic violence, First said. Throw a hurricane into the mix, and chaos can ensue. These communities and these families and these survivors were already very stressed before the storm arrived, said Baldwin from Refuge House to Earther. People are really living day to day, on the edge of being able to meet their basic needs, and thats a normal day. So with the storm hitting those communities, it means that already-isolated victims are even more isolated. It means the resources of law enforcement intended for their protection has been sent to other needs. States like New Jersey and Missouri have begun addressing the spike in domestic violence that accompanies natural disasters through training to emergency response teams and increased funding to domestic violence victims, but more needs to happenespecially in coastal communities in the South that deal with these hurricanes the most, said First. At least in the part of Florida Baldwin serves, her team at Refuge House goes door to door with relief agencies. The state brings the food and water, and Refuge House brings the counseling and comfort victims may seek during this tumultuous time. Theyve been doing this for the last 10 years and remain on the ground in wake of Hurricane Michael. While victims and survivors needed immediate shelter at first, in the weeks and months to come they may need help finding permanent housing or protection from an abuser. As the data shows us, the danger can last long after a storm passes. These coming weeks are just the beginning.","As Hurricane Michael whirled toward Florida over a week ago, Meg Baldwin went into overdrive.

Florida Secretary of State Michael Ertel resigned on Thursday after photos emerged of him posing as a Hurricane Katrina victim in blackface at a 2005 Halloween party.
Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis selected Ertel as secretary of state before taking office in January. According to the Tallahassee Democrat, which published the pictures on Thursday, Ertel previously served as supervisor of elections for Seminole County beginning in February 2005meaning the photos were taken during his time in office. Ironically, Ertel reportedly has a commendable record of expanding the franchise: The City of Longwood awarded him the Martin Luther King, Jr. award for registering voters and helped to make voting in Seminole County easier and more secure. He also used his office to help high school students register to vote even as former Gov. Rick Scott tried to restrict student voting. He criticized Scotts notorious voter purges and rejected Donald Trumps claim that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election.
In light of this track record, many Florida Democrats were pleased when DeSantis tapped Ertel as the states chief elections officer. For good reason: The Florida Secretary of State is tasked with enforcing Amendment 4, an initiative that restores voting rights to rehabilitated felons. DeSantis had urged counties not to register former felons until the legislature passed enabling legislation. But Ertel directed his office to accept their applications, noting, correctly, that the amendment is self-executing.
The photos that emerged on Thursday, however, are so horrifically racist, so vicious and bigoted, that Ertel likely had no choice but to step down. Ertel told the Tallahassee Democrat that he was, indeed, the individual in the pictures, wearing blackface, red lipstick, earrings, false breasts, a New Orleans Saints bandana, and a t-shirt that read Katrina Victim. (The photos were taken shortly after the hurricane had devastated New Orleans.) DeSantis quickly accepted his resignation.
Now the governor will appoint a new secretary of state to oversee Amendment 4s execution. With luck, that official will share Ertels support for voting rights but lack his racist baggage. Unfortunately, DeSantis has a sordid history of association with racistsa fact his opponent, Andrew Gillum, highlighted during the campaign. And if Ertels successor shares DeSantis view of voting rights, he or she will work feverishly to suppress the suffrage of racial minorities.
In other words, a few weeks into DeSantis tenure, Gillums warning has already proved prescient.

https://www.facebook.com/philip.bump,"It took only an hour or two for President Trump’s attempt to downplay the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria to be undercut by more accurate data. On Thursday, that effort looks even more starkly misguided with the release of new, much-higher estimates of mortality after the storm. In early October, though, Trump was almost celebratory. Sitting at a table with the island’s governor, he sought to demonstrate that he and his administration were prioritizing recovery efforts, using the failures of the George W. Bush administration on the Gulf Coast in 2005 as a counterpoint. “Every death is a horror,” Trump said. “But if you look at a real catastrophe like [Hurricane] Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering — nobody has ever seen anything like this.” He asked Gov. Ricardo Rosselló what the death toll was from Maria and was told that, at that moment, it was 16. “Sixteen people certified. Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump crowed. “You can be very proud of all of your people, all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud.” By the time Trump got on Air Force One to head back to the mainland, that death toll had already been revised upward to 34. It kept trickling higher, eventually landing at 64. For Trump, the problem seems primarily to have been political. His administration, lauded for its handling of the storms that struck Texas and Florida, was being criticized for its slow response to the situation in Puerto Rico and its failure to be prepared for the storm in advance. By downplaying the death toll and, more specifically, by comparing it with the political gold standard in failed hurricane responses, Trump hoped to deflect that criticism. But even after the number of deaths was pegged at 64, it was widely understood that the figure was far too low. While determining the number of storm-related deaths concretely is often almost impossible for both practical and political reasons, it was obvious that the politically convenient double-digit numbers being used were wrong. Comparing annual mortality figures with the number of deaths reported after the storm, for example, showed a much bigger toll. The New York Times put the count at over 1,000 by the beginning of November — including an estimate of 556 deaths at the time of Trump’s visit. That would be nearly 35 times as many as Trump had insisted. On Thursday, the Times reported that the government of Puerto Rico would give a higher figure to Congress in a request for additional recovery funds. The new figure: 1,427. More than 22 times as many as the previous estimate. In that light, the comparison to Katrina looks far worse — as does Trump’s insistence that, on his watch, the government had avoided “the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died.” It’s worth noting that the new official estimate from Puerto Rico is substantially lower than an estimate determined by a survey on the island conducted by a research team from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Its estimate was that more than 4,600 people could have died after the storm, a total that makes Katrina pale in comparison. The Washington Post’s fact-checking team was quick to note that this figure was a significant outlier in estimates of the mortality rate and that the margin of error in the study was very, very large, swinging from about 800 to 8,500 deaths. The new figure of 1,427, though, is bad enough. Every death is, as the president said, a horror. What’s unclear now is how many of those deaths could have been prevented by better preparation or a more effective response. (After the storm hit, Trump blamed the “very big ocean” separating Puerto Rico from the continental United States for slowing relief efforts.) Comparisons to Katrina were inevitable with the newly released death toll, given how close the two figures are. But it’s Trump himself who set that disaster as the example to avoid. According to Trump’s own rhetoric, Maria was a “real catastrophe.”",Washington Post The revised death toll in Puerto Rico makes Trump's comparison to Katrina look even worse Washington Post It only took an hour or two for President Trump's attempt to downplay the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria to be undercut …,2018-08-09T15:20:29Z,"{'id': 'the-washington-post', 'name': 'The Washington Post'}",The revised death toll in Puerto Rico makes Trump's comparison to Katrina look even worse - Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/09/the-revised-death-toll-in-puerto-rico-makes-trumps-comparison-to-katrina-look-even-worse/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KzhDPmP83NCSJZxfTPHPX4Ipr_g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LA5RP5MGDI43VEANL32OMRI7ME.jpg,the-washington-post,The Washington Post,Hurricane Katrina,1
Beth Skwarecki,"A toxic red tide has been affecting Florida beaches since last year, and is especially bad right now. Our friends at Earther are covering the subject in depth, but if youre perplexed about what a red tide is and why everyone is talking about it, we have answers to your basic questions. The shape of things to come in U.S. politics could be decided, in no small part, by foul-smelling, Read more Read What is a red tide, and why is it called that? A red tide is actually a bunch of microscopic creatures floating in the water. The ocean is always full of microbes, but when we talk about a red tide were thinking of certain species that sometimes appear red and can fill the water with their naturally-produced toxins. The red tide in Florida is the work of a species called Karenia brevis. Each individual K. brevis is a single cell, with a little tail that it uses to swim. It can make food from sunlight, like plants do, so its considered a type of algae. And because its a tiny living thing in the ocean, its also a type of plankton. K. brevis is a brownish color under the microscope, but when seawater is full of them, we can see the water as tinged with redor sometimes yellow or brown. Other, harmless algae can also turn water interesting colors, so instead of red tide its considered more precise to talk about a harmful algal bloom. What causes it to bloom? An algal bloom is a large population of algaebajillions of the tiny creatures filling up the seawater in a particular area. When conditions are right, including plenty of nutrients in the water, algae reproduce. Imagine if every time you walked into an all-you-can-eat buffet, you could just have a bunch of babies so that your whole family could overrun the restaurant and devour everything inside. K. brevis blooms in the ocean every year, and washes up on Floridas Gulf Coast shores. Its not the kind of bloom thats associated fertilizer runoffthats the other bloom affecting Florida right now (yep, they have two). But the red tide bloom might be feeding on the other one, and fertilizer might play a role. That said, its usually other factors, including ocean currents, that make red tides bloom in Floridas waters each year. K. brevis thrives on carbon dioxide and enjoys warm water, so climate change may be part of why this years bloom has gotten especially bad. Its been a summer of algae for the Sunshine State. Last month, Governor Rick Scott declared a Read more Read This years bloom started last October, and didnt clear up this spring like the blooms typically do. Theres a good chance it will get worse from here, since red tide season is starting up again. How toxic is it really? K. brevis makes a neurotoxin (a poison that affects the nerves and brain) called brevetoxin. This toxin can kill animals, including fish and birds. Manatees and sea turtles have also turned up dead during the recent red tide. People who eat shellfish contaminated with the toxin can get neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, so its important not to collect or eat shellfish from an area affected by red tide. The toxin is odorless, colorless, and tasteless, and its not destroyed by cooking. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and a tingling or numbness in the face, hands, and feet. We can also breathe the toxin. When algae-filled waves crash on the beach, they can break apart some of the algaes cells and send their toxins into the air. People with asthma or other lung conditions are most at risk, but healthy people can be affected too. The symptoms you would notice are difficulty breathing, and perhaps eye irritations as well. Beaches affected by red tide will often post a sign that warns about breathing the air in the area, especially if you have lung conditions like asthma. The water may be full of dead fish, so its not like you wanted to swim there anyway. Did the hurricane make this better or worse? Its too early to say for sure, but NBC reports that many areas have seen a decrease in the amount of K. brevis in water samples. Its possible that the hurricane mixed up the ocean water like a blender, diluting the red tide organism, according to one biologist they spoke to. On the other hand, flooding that results from hurricanes can push nutrients into the sea for K. brevis to feed on. Smithsonian reports that red tide increased after four hurricanes hit Florida in 2004, but also that Hurricane Katrina was followed by a decrease in red tide. So well have to wait and see.","A toxic “red tide” has been affecting Florida beaches since last year, and is especially bad right now.

Bill Bostock,"A veteran reporter who covered Hurricane Katrina in 2005 gave a dark warning on Tuesday to people refusing to evacuate ahead of Hurricane Florence: ""write your Social Security number on your arm, so officials can identify your body."" Mark Schleifstein has been reporting on hurricanes and severe weather for New Orleans newspaper The Times-Picayune since 1984, and was part of a team who won a Pulitzer prize for their Katrina coverage. Hurricane Florence is expected to make landfall somewhere on North Carolina's coast late on Thursday night or early on Friday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Evacuations have been ordered in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. Officials say the biggest danger is from a storm surge and heavy rain, which could cause flood waters as high as 13 feet. Schliefstein said that those who will not follow orders to leave best ""keep an axe in their attic."" Schleifstein's full message, posted on Twitter, said: ""Live along areas of the N.C./S.C. coast ordered to evacuate and not going to do it? Keep an axe in your attic. And write your Social Security number on your arm, so officials can identify your body."" More than a million people on the east coast have been given mandatory evacuation orders by the government. But not everyone is listening. CBS News interviewed one man staying behind, who said: ""We have two generators, plenty of gasoline, everything's filled up. If I need more gas, I'll just take it out of my vehicle."" Schleifstein's advice on Tuesday to those residents who won't leave their homes is informed by his articles on the category-five Hurricane Katrina in 2005. As part of that he covered the 1,836 deaths from the hurricane, many of which were from flooding. In an article for George Washington University's magazine, GW, he wrote that his own home was hit by a 12-foot storm surge. He said: ""Our home was inundated by 12 feet of water, or, as my wife explains to new acquaintances, 'We had two feet of water…on the second floor.'""

RON NIXON,"As homeland security secretary, Ms. Nielsen will be responsible for carrying out the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce immigration. She will also be responsible for aviation security, domestic counterterrorism and preparations for natural and man-made disasters. Additionally, she will oversee the hiring of 5,000 new Border Patrol agents and 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Mr. Trump, in a January executive order, called for an increase in the number of immigration officers to secure the nation’s borders and get tough on illegal immigration. The House has approved funding for an increase in funding for new Border Patrol agents, but the Senate has not acted on the legislation. Ms. Nielsen will face a number of challenges. Even as the department tries to hire new Border Patrol agents, it is losing them at a faster rate. The agency has had trouble retaining agents who face polygraph requirements, working in remote locations and receiving lower annual pay compared with other law enforcement jobs. Annual turnover rates averages 6 percent for the Border Patrol. And reports by the Homeland Security inspector general released in the past few months have questioned a number of programs at the agency. One report questioned the contributions of the federal air marshal program, which places armed marshals on commercial flights to protect passengers and crews against a terrorist attack. The report said funding for the program, which costs about $10 billion a year, could be put to better use. Another report found that T.S.A. screeners at the nation’s airports continue to struggle to identify weapons and bombs at security checkpoints. Undercover agents for the inspector general managed to slip fake weapons pass screeners nearly half the time, according to a person with knowledge of the report, which remains classified. Ms. Nielsen worked at the T.S.A. after it was created as a response to the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. She left the government in 2007, serving as a private-sector consultant who helped government entities and private companies devise plans to guard against cyberattacks. Ms. Nielsen also served on President George W. Bush’s homeland security council, devising a national response plan for domestic events and helping to compile a report on lessons from the bungled federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. A bipartisan group of former homeland security officials endorsed her nomination, including two former secretaries of the department, Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, both Republicans who served under Mr. Bush. “Ms. Nielsen has been engaged in counterterrorism, all-hazard risk mitigation, critical infrastructure protection and response policy from the earliest days of what we now know as homeland security,” they jointly wrote in a letter to the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month.

JON PARELES,"Six weeks after the hurricane, leading New Orleans musicians gathered to record as the New Orleans Social Club, a lineup that included Mr. Butler, Mr. Neville, the guitarist Leo Nocentelli, the bassist George Porter Jr. of the Meters and many guests. Their album, “Sing Me Back Home,” was released in 2006. The group reconvened for occasional performances, including one that was documented for the public television series “ Austin City Limits.” After Katrina, Mr. Butler moved to Denver before settling in Brooklyn. In New York he assembled a New Orleans-flavored band, Jambalaya. He also collaborated with the trumpeter Steve Bernstein and his group the Hot 9, reviving traditional jazz tunes and New Orleans R&amp;B with postmodern glee. Mr. Butler’s final album, “ Viper’s Drag,” was made with Mr. Bernstein and the Hot 9. “Henry was fiercely independent, and he did not want to be second fiddle to anybody,” Mr. Bernstein said. “I’d just listen to him play the tunes, and I’d record it, and I’d end up transcribing what he played for the band. So the band was three-dimensional Henry, playing something he had played once. And then he’d be improvising on top of his improvisation.” Mr. Bernstein added: “No one had a left hand like him. No one on the planet. It was so strong and fast, and he had such control of every part of it: the tone, the dynamics, the speed. He did all these things that were so fast that no one else could do them. If you looked at his hands, they were blurs.” Mr. Butler learned he had colon cancer in 2015 and underwent surgery. The disease returned in 2017, and he used the crowdfunding site GoFundMe.com to finance alternative therapy. But between medical treatments, he continued to perform worldwide. After appearing at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in April, he performed in Beijing and in Melbourne, Australia, and he was planning European dates in July. His final concert was on June 18 at a Jazz for Justice benefit in New York City.

Hayley Miller,"It’s been nearly 11 months since Hurricane Maria terrorized Puerto Rico, decimating the island’s farmlands, power grid and homes ― and likely claiming hundreds and hundreds of lives in its wake. Independent investigations conducted separately by The New York Times, Penn State University and Harvard University estimated Maria’s death toll could be in the thousands. The official death count has remained at 64, though Puerto Rican officials quietly conceded this week in a report to Congress that over 1,427 deaths may be directly or indirectly linked to the historic storm. In the months since Maria, President Donald Trump has been remarkably silent about Puerto Rico’s struggle to recover. Trump, a notoriously prolific tweeter, hasn’t mentioned the hurricane on social media since November, and he hasn’t visited Puerto Rico since October. The only time Trump publicly addressed the death toll was during his only post-Maria visit to the island, in which he suggested Puerto Ricans were lucky Maria wasn’t a “ real catastrophe ” like Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which left over 1,800 dead. At the time, the official death toll was 16, though Puerto Rican leaders, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz repeatedly and publicly warned that the number of fatalities was exponentially higher. In mid-October, Trump conceded that he believed Maria was actually “worse than Katrina,” but still gave his administration “a 10” out of 10 in its response to the storm. So why hasn’t Trump publicly acknowledged the likely staggering number of deaths? Or personally provided updates on Puerto Rico’s monthslong struggle to restore power to its residents? Or met with any of the hundreds of thousands of displaced Puerto Ricans? HuffPost asked the White House on Thursday if Trump would care to comment on Puerto Rico’s death toll, given the growing indication that hundreds or thousands had died. In response, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley provided a statement: There’s only one official count and the actual counting of disaster related fatalities is the local responsibility of Puerto Rico. We have been supportive of Governor Rossello’s efforts to ensure a full accounting and transparency. Those grieving deserve no less. The whole of government remains focused on ongoing recovery and preparedness for the current Hurricane season. When asked in a subsequent email whether Trump still believes the federal response was adequate, Jessica Ditto, deputy communications director for the White House, responded that “the entire federal response was massive, historic and unprecedented.” But many activists and lawmakers disagree with the White House’s assessment. Some expressed sorrow on Thursday over the Puerto Rican government’s discreet death toll concession, and others tore into Trump for spending millions of dollars on the creation of a new armed service known as the Space Force instead of sending more aid to Puerto Rico. Tragically, the death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria is far higher than the official count. The federal gov't hasn't done enough to assist or force accountability. I’ve called for a bipartisan commission to investigate the Trump Admin’s response. https://t.co/zWTq84Z882 https://t.co/wSBPcOUKCs — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) August 9, 2018 Trump’s public concern over Puerto Rico’s recovery appeared to subside following a wave of self-congratulatory statements from his administration on what it deemed a successful hurricane response. Just nine days after Maria made landfall, then-acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke called the government’s relief efforts “ a good news story,” sparking outrage among lawmakers such as Cruz. “This is a people-are-dying story,” Cruz told CNN in response to Duke’s comments. “This is a story of a devastation that continues to worsen because people are not getting food and water.” For months, Cruz pleaded with the Trump administration to send additional aid to help the millions of lives uprooted by Maria, the most powerful storm to hit the the U.S. territory in at least 80 years. “I am begging anyone that can hear us to save us from dying,” Cruz said in televised remarks days before Trump’s October visit to the island. “If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying. And you are killing us with the inefficiency and bureaucracy.” Trump responded to Cruz by claiming she was simply playing politics and accused Puerto Rican workers of not doing their part to help in relief efforts. “Results of recovery efforts will speak much louder than complaints by San Juan Mayor,” he tweeted on Sept. 30, adding later that she exhibited “poor leadership.” ""Dammit, this is not a good news story"": San Juan mayor slams acting DHS Secretary Duke's comments about Puerto Rico https://t.co/Lx5pOp6iFs — Joshua Chavers (@JoshuaChavers) September 29, 2017 Days later, Trump and first lady Melania Trump would arrive for their first and only post-Maria visit to Puerto Rico, where the president would downplay the devastation. “Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump had said, comparing Maria’s death toll to Katrina’s. “You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud. Everyone around this table, and everyone watching, can be very proud of what’s taking place in Puerto Rico.” Following his remarks at the briefing, Trump made a few other stops in San Juan, including at a church where he made headlines by throwing paper towels to Puerto Ricans displaced by Maria. Trump also took several opportunities during and after Maria to remind Puerto Ricans that their government was $74 billion in debt, and that despite the historic storm, they would still have to deal with their financial woes on the other side. “When Mr. Trump suggested that Puerto Rico’s plight had thrown the federal government’s budget out of wack, and that Katrina was a worse disaster, well... that hit hard,” Wanda Acosta, the 56-year-old owner of a boutique hotel in Rincon, Puerto Rico, told HuffPost in an email Friday. “Saying that Puerto Ricans want everything done for them was outrageous!” she added. “Everyone was out in the streets, on their farms, in their yards, repairing their businesses, cleaning and clearing, helping and cooking and just surviving without power and water.” By the end of October, Trump’s tweets about Puerto Rico had ceased. He had tweeted about Maria roughly two-dozen times ― about the same number of times he’s tweeted attacks ( one as recently as Friday ) against NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality. By comparison, he’s tweeted about special counsel Robert Mueller ’s Russia investigation over 85 times since Maria. There have been significant developments related to Puerto Rico’s recovery ― studies on the number of fatalities, government corruption charges, the extraordinarily prolonged restoration of the island’s power. Trump hasn’t publicly addressed any of them. A Politico investigation published in March found Trump had reacted far more aggressively to Hurricane Harvey than to Maria. He visited Houston twice within the first eight days after Harvey struck the Gulf Coast, killing over 100 people. He waited 13 days to visit Puerto Rico. It took 10 days for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to grant permanent disaster aid in Texas, compared to 43 days for Puerto Rico, Politico reported. I am begging anyone that can hear us to save us from dying. If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying. And you are killing us with the inefficiency and bureaucracy. Carmen Yulín Cruz, mayor of San Juan “After witnessing first hand the horror &amp; devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas!” Trump tweeted at the time. Two days later, he declared Sept. 3, 2017, a national day of prayer for the victims of Harvey. Nearly every indication suggests Hurricane Maria was responsible for close to ― if not more than ― the number of deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. President George W. Bush ’s legacy was, in part, defined by his administration’s widely panned response to the natural disaster, which left over 1,500 people dead in Louisiana alone. Bush’s approval rating dramatically dropped in the wake of Katrina. Bush eventually took “ full responsibility ” for the federal failures, though not before the then-head of New Orleans’ emergency operations called the federal government’s slow response a “national disgrace.” Despite significant backlash, Trump emerged relatively unscathed from Maria’s destruction. His response to it didn’t appear to have much of an impact on his approval rating, as it continued to hover around 36 percent in the months after. It has since climbed to 41 percent in recent weeks, according to the Pew Research Center. Despite public pressure, Trump did not further inject himself into the national conversation about Puerto Rico’s fight to recover. A George Washington University study commissioned by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló in December to scientifically determine the excess deaths related to Hurricane Maria is expected to be completed in the coming weeks and could finally provoke a statement from Trump. A spokeswoman for the university told HuffPost that the study was expected to be released “this summer.” It was initially slated for completion by late May, though the school said in a statement that data collection had taken longer than expected. “We owe it to the people of Puerto Rico to have a precise number, along with the data we need to make better preparations for future disaster situations,” Héctor Pesquera, secretary of Puerto Rico’s Department of Public Safety, said in a statement Thursday. “With this information, we can understand what procedures need to be in place in Puerto Rico to prevent such a high loss of life from ever happening again.”","In October, the president suggested Puerto Ricans were lucky Hurricane Maria wasn't a ""real catastrophe"" like Katrina in New Orleans.",2018-08-11T11:01:37Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Will He Ever Acknowledge The Massive Loss Of Life In Puerto Rico?,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-puerto-rico-death-toll_us_5b6c41c8e4b0ae32af95c6bb,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b6c42e619000014035017be.jpeg?cache=7AUiaoKuEa&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,Hurricane Katrina,1
Marcus Gilmer,"Hurricane Florence is slowly but surely moving toward landfall along the East Coast. While its winds have decreased, making the storm a Category 2, it's still an incredibly powerful and dangerous storm with extreme rains expected to fall over the course of the next few days in the Carolinas and Virginia as it slows near the coast. That slowdown could produce historic amounts of rain for that part of the country, if current forecasts hold. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is growing: 5 things to know about the monster storm Meteorologist Ryan Maue of WeatherModels tweeted some projections on Thursday morning. Maue's models suggest that around 17 trillion gallons of rain will fall across North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia with some spots receiving as much as 30 inches of rain before Florence is finished. As Hurricane #Florence makes landfall — or tries to very slowly — the rainfall will add up quickly across the Carolinas but also Virginia... I'd bet on maximum totals &gt; 30"" in many counties... forecast totals from the adjacent states near landfall around 17 trillion gallons. pic.twitter.com/xcfio0u1fA — Ryan Maue | weathermodels.com (@RyanMaue) September 13, 2018 That is an astounding amount of rain, sure to lead to widespread flooding and billions of dollars in damage. ( Over 24 trillion gallons of rain fell on Texas and Louisiana thanks to Hurricane Harvey and we all saw what that did.) Maue uses multiple models, including data that's agreed upon by the National Hurricane Center, local National Weather Service offices, and the Weather Prediction Center, to come up with his forecasts. It could (hopefully!) be less or it could be (hopefully not!) more. Maue points to geography as a factor, saying that ""these storms have a tendency to really wring out the moisture when they come up against the [Appalachian] mountains."" The tropical cyclone-related rainfall records for the Southeast since 1950. 1870-1949 rain data do not reveal wetter storms for the Carolinas. As 40"" local amounts are possible from Florence, the rain forecast is beyond what has been previously seen/witnessed for the Carolinas. pic.twitter.com/BmVZQnZvhj — NWS WPC (@NWSWPC) September 12, 2018 It also won't help matters that a ridge will hold Florence in place, keeping the storm from moving very much for a few days. ""It's blocked right now to the north, to the west, and to the east right now,"" Maue said. ""So the only place it can really go is a little nudge south,"" until it can eventually go around the ridge and move north. The forecast amount of rain is hard to wrap your brain around. What does 17 trillion gallons look like? It would fill 26 million Olympic-size swimming pools (660,000 gallons each). That much water could fill up nearly 3.5 Great Salt Lakes. It's enough water to submerge around 81,500 square miles in a foot of water, which would cover the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Jersey. It's roughly 68 times the amount of water that was pumped out of New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. It's important to remember that these numbers are just predictions for now. We won't actually know how much rain falls on the U.S. from Florence until, well, it actually happens. Maue notes that the heaviest rain could reach inland all the way to Raleigh, which is about 150 miles from the North Carolina coast. The National Weather Service says local amounts in some areas could top 40 inches. There has been weather monitoring in the city of Wilmington, NC for nearly 150 years. The most recent NCEP WPC rainfall prediction for Hurricane #Florence would shatter the historical record for 7-day rainfall accumulation by more than a foot. pic.twitter.com/CsSrSfRMKE — Robert Rohde (@rarohde) September 13, 2018 Whatever the totals wind up being, Florence is sure to bring destructive winds, rain, and floods to the area, meaning a long clean-up and recovery to come.

Julia Jacobo,"The newly-appointed Florida secretary of state has resigned after photos showing him dressed in blackface more than a decade ago have emerged.
Michael Ertel, who was appointed late last month by Gov. Ron DeSantis, submitted his resignation ""effective immediately,"" according to an email he sent to Florida Director of Executive Staff Diane Moulton on Thursday afternoon, which was obtained by ABC News.
DeSantis accepted Ertel's resignation, according to a statement from the governor's press office.
The photos were taken at a private Halloween party in 2005, which Ertel attended dressed up as a ""Hurricane Katrina victim,"" two months after the hurricane had left New Orleans in devastation, the Tallahassee Democrat
reported.
Ertel, 49, had just been appointed as supervisor of elections for Seminole County in February 2005, according to the local newspaper, which confirmed with Ertel that the man in the photos -- in blackface, wearing false eyelashes, red lipstick, a New Orleans saints bandanna and a purple T-shirt stuffed with fake breasts -- was, in fact, him.
Michael Ertel speaks during a panel discussion on election problems at a pre-legislative news conference in Tallahassee, Fla., Jan. 30, 2013.
At a press conference on hurricane relief in Marianna, Florida on Thursday, DeSantis described the situation as ""unfortunate,"" adding that he believes that Ertel regrets his actions.
""I think he's done a lot of good work, but at the same time, I've gotta have an administration that's focused on what matters to Floridians, and I don't want to get mired in kind-of side controversies, and so I felt it was best to just accept the resignation and move on.""
The racist photos are ""the sole blemish"" on Ertel's ""seemingly spotless public career,"" according to the Tallahassee Democrat. His Twitter account became inactive after the news broke of his resignation.
Ertel did not immediately respond to an ABC News request for comment. He did not offer additional comment to the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper.

KEVIN McGILL / AP,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A white man who fired a shotgun at three African-Americans amid the chaos that followed Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans more than 13 years ago pleaded guilty Wednesday to two federal criminal counts. Roland Bourgeois, 55, was indicted in 2010 and originally pleaded not guilty. His case dragged on for years, with a series of delays and hearings related to his physical and mental health and his competency to stand trial. During court appearances, he appeared frail and used a cane. He was out on bond at times but was returned to custody last year after an unspecified bond violation. Prosecutors said Bourgeois, who lived in Mississippi when he was first charged, fired a shotgun at three black men, wounding one seriously. Authorities said Bourgeois and others used racial epithets in discussing shooting black people and defending the Algiers Point neighborhood of New Orleans from “outsiders” after the storm. The guilty plea Wednesday came after Bourgeois waived a grand jury hearing and prosecutors filed amended charges in a bill of information: interfering with the victim’s rights because of their race and using a firearm in a crime of violence. U.S. District Judge Mary Ann Vial Lemmon still must review the guilty plea. New Orleans news outlets say sentencing was tentatively set for Jan. 17. Final resolution of the case will mark the end of one of a handful of violent post-Katrina incidents that added to the slow and painful recovery from the storm that, when levees failed, flooded 80 percent of New Orleans. Two others involved police, including the deadly shooting of unarmed civilians at the Danziger bridge in the days after the storm — a case that led to eventual guilty pleas from several officers during a long and complicated court case. In an unrelated case post-Katrina case, five other officers were tried on charges related to the death of 31-year-old Henry Glover, who was fatally shot outside a strip mall before his body was burned. The officer who burned the body was the only one who stood convicted when the case was over. The officer who fatally shot Glover was convicted of manslaughter but was later acquitted by another jury after an appeals court awarded him a new trial.",A white man who fired at three African-Americans post-Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans pleaded guilty to two federal criminal counts.,2018-10-18T00:16:48Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","13 Years Later, Man Pleads Guilty for Post-Katrina Racial Shooting",http://time.com/5427976/13-years-guilty-katrina-shooting/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-119818994.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Hurricane Katrina,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","One of the things you can count on in the wake of a hurricane making landfall is people clamoring for a new classification system. Like clockwork, that’s what’s happening with Florence. And frankly, the discussion has never been more urgent thanks to climate change. After rapidly intensifying into a Category 4 beast, Florence slowly decayed until it landed in the Carolinas as a Category 1 storm. It was degraded further over the course of the weekend to a tropical storm and then a depression. All of these changes were based on one factor: How strong the maximum winds were. The idea that our sole way of defining hurricanes is by winds is supremely misguided. Some meteorologists hate it. Many people are confused by it. For storms that take a major human toll, it seems especially wrong-footed given that water is responsible for 90 percent of all deaths according to 2016 research. It’s like if Madden ratings where only based on a player’s ability to run (sorry Tom Brady). And with a storm like Florence, it’s easy to see why we need a new scale. The winds did a small portion of the damage while historic rainfall has created a flooding crisis that’s still unfolding. Storm surge—which was driven by Florence’s huge wind field and not just peak winds—further damaged the coast. Some people ignored evacuation orders because the storm was continually downgraded until landfall. Our current ranking system is literally putting people in danger. But that’s not even the worst part. Climate change is clearly intensifying the rainfall and surge associated with storms, making the Saffir Simpson scale even more out of synch with the hazards people living in hurricane zones face. The heaviest downpours are getting heavier thanks to climate change for a simple reason: A warmer atmosphere can hold more water. When that water falls out, look out below. The heavy rains from Florence and Harvey as well as what we saw recently with Lane in Hawaii exemplify that trend. In Harvey’s case, it was second-most costly hurricane on record with much of that rain falling over one of the largest cities in the U.S. Research published earlier this year indicates that hurricanes will get wetter still. Then there’s the storm surge part. Thanks again to climate change, oceans are rising. Seas have climbed about a foot since record keeping began. That gives storm surge a huge lift to inundate areas further inland. The costliest hurricane in U.S. history was Katrina (a Category 3 at landfall), which did most of its damage from storm surge. Ditto for Hurricane Sandy (Category 1) and Hurricane Irma (Category 3 at landfall in Florida), which are also among the five most destructive hurricanes. Like Florence, those storms has massive wind fields that also allowed them to stir up more of the ocean. And also like Florence, they got a lift from sea level rise. Sandy’s surge wouldn’t have done nearly as much damage to New York’s subway system, for example, if it weren’t for the extra sea level rise boost. Future storm surge will only be worse and it won’t take a Sandy-level storm to inundate New York. In fact, the only hurricane on the top five list that did beaucoup damage from wind is Maria. That speaks to a lot of things, notably the bad shape Puerto Rico’s grid was in and how slow the federal response was. That points to how we need to improve how and where we build, but it doesn’t alter the changing calculus of climate change and its influence on the storms themselves. Now look, the Saffir Simpson scale has a great back story. It came into existence in 1971 owing to the efforts of Herbert Saffir, a wind engineer, and Bob Simpson, the head of the National Hurricane Center. Their goal was the give the public a better sense of the risks hurricanes pose. And the scale originally focused on the impact of winds on cheap buildings like mobile homes. You could argue there’s a little bias since Saffir was a wind guy, but to be fair this was also progressive thinking given that it’s inevitably the poor that suffer the most from storms. But with climate change set to make poor people’s lives even worse (to say nothing of the rest of us as well), Saffir’s namesake scale needs to be redrawn. And we should do it soon so people get out of harm’s way before the pig shit hits the fan.","One of the things you can count on in the wake of a hurricane making landfall is people clamoring for a new classification system.

Alexander Kay,"Tropical Storm Gordon on Tuesday barreled toward central U.S. Gulf Coast, where it was expected to become a hurricane and bring high winds and heavy rain to the region, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. The storm was gaining strength and was expected to become a hurricane as it comes ashore late on Tuesday near the border between Louisiana and Mississippi, and drop as much as 8 inches (20 cm) of rain in some areas of the U.S. South still reeling from hurricanes a year ago. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency, saying 200 Louisiana National Guardsmen were being deployed, along with 63 high-water trucks, 39 boats, and 4 helicopters. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency warned of storm surges of between 3 and 5 feet (1 and 1.5 meters) and told South Mississippi residents to be prepared to evacuate. Gordon was generating winds of 65 miles per hour (105 km per hour) on Tuesday as it steamed west-northwest at 17 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. Gordon was located about 280 miles (450 km) east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River and was packing maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour (100kmh), the Miami-based weather forecaster said. By Monday afternoon the storm had passed over Florida's southern tip. There were no reports of any injuries or deaths or any damages to buildings, said Alberto Moscoso, a spokesman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management.

The Category 4 of 5 hurricane -- with winds anywhere from 130-156 mph -- made landfall in Galveston, Texas (pictured), then headed north through the Great Plains. Anywhere from 8,000 to 12,000 people died in the storm. Photo courtesy: Creative Commons New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has declared a state of emergency for her city, closing all non-essential government offices on Tuesday. Last year, powerful hurricanes walloped Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing thousands of deaths, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damage, massive power outages and devastation to hundreds of thousands of structures. At the mouth of the Mississippi River, around the area of New Orleans, the storm could generate a surge of up to 4 feet(1.2 meters) and smaller surges could hit coastland along other parts of the Gulf Coast, the Miami-based hurricane center said. U.S. oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp on Monday evacuated workers and shut production at two offshore oil platforms, and other companies with production and refining operations along the Gulf Coast said they were securing facilities. The U.S. Coast Guard also warned that the ports of New Orleans as well as Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, may have to close within 48 hours when gale force winds from Gordon are expected to arrive.

"Anna Goldfarb, Brian McManus","Comedian John Mulaney has this great bit in his stand-up routine about the wonderful rush that accompanies abandoning a commitment: “In terms of instant relief, canceling plans is like heroin.” And he’s right! What feels better than wiggling out of a looming obligation when you’re not in the mood to follow through? And thanks to the various, impersonal ways we communicate, it’s never been easier to flake out. The New York Times says we’re in the golden age of bailing : “Technology makes it all so easy,” David Brooks wrote. “You just pull out your phone and bailing on a rendezvous is as easy as canceling an Uber driver.” While some people are bold enough to dash off a text saying, “Actually, I can’t make it,” many of us aren’t as comfortable being so direct. In an effort to save face, we resort to making up excuses when we back out of plans. Sometimes the lies we tell are merely an exaggeration––an unwillingness to apply a fresh coat of mascara before heading out is cited as “exhaustion” via text. Sometimes we try to pack in plenty of gruesome medical details in an effort to disgust our way out of plans: “Sorry I can’t make your baby shower. My anus feels like it’s being attacked by an army of fire ants!” Or sometimes our lies are so cartoonishly outlandish that it haunts (and amuses!) us for many years to come. We asked friends and co-workers about the pettiest/biggest fibs they told to bail on plans.

Jenny Staletovich,"Get ready to batten down the hatches. Again. In a preseason forecast issued Thursday, Colorado State University’s Tropical Meteorology Project predicts the upcoming hurricane season that begins June 1 will again be busy, although not as bad as the brutal 2017 season. The forecast calls for seven hurricanes, three hurricanes at Cat 3 intensity or worse, and 14 named storms. Hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach, a protege of pioneering meteorologist William Gray, blamed warm waters in the western Atlantic and the mediocre odds for an El Niño in the Pacific for the uptick. “The odds of getting a real gangbusters El Niño that kills the season is slim,” he said. “We can’t rule anything out, but the odds are reduced.” This year’s forecast, the 35th in what has become a traditional season opener, relies on 29 years worth of observational data, although Klotzbach and fellow forecaster Michael Bell warn that no prediction is guaranteed. The forecast will be updated, and likely improve, in late May and again in August before the peak of the season kicks in. “It’s like trying to pick who’s going to win the NCAA tournament in the first round,” he said. “Your odds are a lot higher in the final four.” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plans to issue its forecast for the season in late May, said National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen. If Colorado State’s forecast holds true, another busy season could draw a collective moan from South Florida and the Caribbean after a punishing 2017 season. The Atlantic churned up a record 10 hurricanes in a row last year, including Harvey, Irma and Maria, for a total of 17 named storms and six major hurricanes. On average, the Atlantic produces12 named storms and just three major hurricanes. The accumulated cyclone energy — which tallies the sheer force of a hurricane season by totaling the number, duration and strength of storms — was the seventh highest ever recorded and the worst since 2005, when Katrina and Wilma hammered the Gulf Coast and South Florida. While most of Florida has recovered, parts of the Keys where affordable housing is tight continue to struggle. As of March, Monroe County said nearly 200 families still lived in temporary FEMA trailers. To create the forecast, Klotzbach and Bell looked at past years with similar ocean and atmospheric conditions, including weak La Niña and El Niño patterns. Because ocean temperatures that can fuel hurricanes remain uncertain over the summer and fall, they looked at wide range of temperatures and came up with five comparable seasons. One of those, 1967, included lethal Hurricane Donna, a Cat 4 storm that killed more than 125 people as it wound through the Caribbean, including 13 in the Keys. The forecast also looked at the probability of landfall and put the odds of a Florida-East Coast landfall at 61 percent for a tropical storm, 54 percent for a hurricane and 39 percent for a major hurricane. Klotzbach said some conditions could still change to alter the forecast. If an El Niño blossoms in the Pacific on the heels of the fizzling La Niña, hurricane-smothering wind shear could increase in the Atlantic. It’s also not yet clear whether ocean temperatures will heat up enough over the summer to fuel more intense storms. But since activity in the Atlantic doesn’t typically pick up until August, he said, there’s plenty of time to improve the forecast. “People see June and July come around and not much happens. That’s normal. That happened last year,” he said. “If you had talked to me [in early August] I would have said so far it’s a benign season. Six weeks later it wasn’t benign anymore.”","How busy will hurricane season be in 2018? This forecast has good news and bad news Miami Herald Get ready to batten down the hatches. Again.

Kevin Loria,"Hurricane Michael has picked up steam as it sped across the Gulf of Mexico towards the Florida Panhandle. As of Wednesday at 1:00 p.m. ET, the storm had sustained winds of 150 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center, making it a major, Category 4 hurricane. When Michael makes landfall on the Florida Gulf Coast this afternoon, it'll almost certainly be the strongest storm to ever hit the region. Michael is also on track to be the third strongest hurricane to ever hit the US, and the strongest in 50 years. Michael's minimum central pressure — a key measure of hurricane strength — was measured at 919 millibars at 1:00 p.m. ET. Lower central pressure indicates a stronger storm, so this one is extremely powerful. That measurement indicates Michael is more intense than Hurricane Andrew, which hit Florida in 1992, with a pressure of 922 mb. Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, had a pressure of 920 mb. Central pressure is the measure of how much the atmosphere in the middle of a storm weighs. Normal air pressure is about 1010 mb ; when central pressure is significantly lower than that, things become more turbulent, with more air movement and wind kicking up. Central pressure is actually a better measure of the damage that a hurricane will cause than wind speed, according to a study published in the journal Nature Communications in 2017, though wind is the basis for hurricane categories. Ana Pelisson/Business Insider But Michael is a monster storm by wind speed as well. The sustained 150 mph winds make it not far from a Category 5 storm — the cut off between Category 4 and 5 is wind speeds to 156 mph. There's only been one storm with higher sustained wind speeds this far north in the Gulf of Mexico before: Hurricane Camille in 1969. No matter where the storm ends up falling in the record books, the key message for people in the storm's path remains the same. As the Tallahassee office of the National Weather Service said on Twitter, ""If you're not sheltered in place now, you need to be!""","Hurricane Michael is on track to be the strongest hurricane to hit the US in 50 years, and the third strongest ever.

Rep. Steve Kinga man who makes news with openly racist, white supremacist, and otherwise offensive comments often enough that his own party finally stripped him of his committee assignmentsdredged up an old racist complaint while speaking at a town hall in the overwhelmingly white city of Charter Oak, Iowa, Thursday night:
[H]eres what FEMA tells me: We go to a place like New Orleans, and everybodys looking around saying, Whos going to help me? Whos going to help me? We go to a place like Iowa, and we go see, knock on the door at, say, I make up a name, Johns place, and say, John, you got water in your basement, we can write you a check, we can help you. And John will say, Well, wait a minute, let me get my boots. Its Joe that needs help. Lets go down to his place and help him.
While King, in praising Iowans for their response to the recent flooding along the Missouri River, did not say explicitly why he singled out residents of New Orleans 14 years ago, the majority-black city has long been subject to racist tropes about laziness and reliance on government handouts.
King, who in his comments boasted that he had visited New Orleans after the hurricane and participated in relief efforts, was one of a small number in Congress to oppose a bill providing federal aid to the victims, according to the Washington Post. Hurricane Katrina was the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. in nearly eight decades: According to CNN, at least 1,833 people, mainly in Louisiana, died from the storm and its floods; nearly half of those who died in Louisiana were older than 74. The government estimated the cost of damage at $125 billion.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards called Kings comments disgusting and disheartening on Thursday. When communities are affected by disasters, we come together to help each other, not tear each other down, he tweeted.
U.S. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, who represents a suburban New Orleans district, also quickly condemned Kings statement. His comments about Katrina victims are absurd and offensive, he told the Advocate. [They] are a complete contradiction to the strength and resilience the people of New Orleans demonstrated to the entire nation in the wake of the total devastation they experienced.

Slate,"President Donald Trump, sitting between Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello and first lady Melania Trump, sits down to a briefing on hurricane damage, at Muniz Air National Guard Base in Carolina, Puerto Rico, U.S. October 3, 2017. Jonathan Ernst When Hillary Clinton was running against Donald Trump in 2016, she boiled down concerns about his temperament to a central question: ""Imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States,"" she said. The attack was centered on national security, but the argument went beyond the role of commander in chief to broader questions about Trump's ability to handle any number of potential crises. How would he react to a public health emergency? How would he deal with a natural disaster? We now have an answer to this question as the scope of devastation from Hurricane Maria becomes more clear. What we have learned is that there are life-and-death consequences to putting someone like Donald Trump in command of the federal government. The profound failure of leadership and management that Trump's critics feared has actually happened, and we are just now learning the scale of that disaster. Puerto Ricans were still recovering from Hurricane Irma when Maria made landfall last autumn. The storm devastated the island, destroying homes and crippling vital infrastructure. The crisis that ensued demanded an immediate and robust response from the federal government. But the response was sluggish, even as early reports made clear that this was a serious tragedy in the making. The White House made few preparations in the lead-up to the storm, and it was weeks before the Federal Emergency Management Agency committed its full resources to the island. During that time, clean water was scarce, food was hard to find, and hospitals struggled to care for patients, some with serious injuries and illnesses. Most of Puerto Rico lacked electricity for months, and medical supplies were few and far between. When FEMA did eventually act, it dropped the ball. To deliver 30 million meals, the agency contracted with an Atlanta-based wedding caterer with no experience in emergency management. By the time the company's contract was terminated, it had delivered just 50,000 of those meals. The impact of those missteps wasn't immediately clear. According to the government, only 64 people died in the disaster, compared to more than 1,800 who are estimated to have died in Hurricane Katrina. Trump noted that difference when he visited the island. ""Every death is a horror,"" said Trump, ""but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous—hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here, with really a storm that was just totally overpowering, nobody's ever seen anything like this."" He was congratulating himself, and even took to Twitter to complain of unfair treatment from those who faulted the administration's response: ""Nobody could have done what I've done for #PuertoRico with so little appreciation. So much work!"" We now know this initial death toll was likely wrong by many orders of magnitude. Tracking deaths is always difficult in the wake of such a serious disaster, but recent research makes it clear that the federal government grossly undercounted the number of people who died due to this hurricane. After a review of mortality data, both the New York Times and the Center for Investigative Journalism estimated more than 1,000 deaths from the hurricane and its aftermath. A new Harvard study, released on Tuesday and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, estimated that at least 4,465 people died as a result of Hurricane Maria, which would make it the deadliest natural disaster to strike the United States since 1900, when a powerful hurricane devastated Galveston, Texas, and surrounding areas, killing at least 8,000 people. The researchers, who surveyed thousands of randomly selected homes in Puerto Rico, asked residents about deaths and extrapolated from the results, attributing many of the deaths to hospital disruptions and loss of basic utility services. A faster, stronger response would have prevented some of those deaths. Even if the White House was unprepared when the storm initially hit, much of the aftermath could have been averted if President Trump had focused his administration on the disaster and brought the weight of the federal government to bear on the unfolding tragedy. Instead, Trump sent every signal that he simply didn't care. He downplayed the devastation to Puerto Rico and blamed Puerto Ricans for not doing more to repair the damage. He went after the mayor of San Juan, who had criticized the government's response. He didn't use his Twitter account to publicize relief efforts or generally encourage Americans to help. What he did do during that time, however, was campaign for political allies and start a feud with black football players. Puerto Rico is part of the United States, Puerto Ricans are Americans citizens, and as president, Donald Trump had a responsibility to assist them as they battled disaster. He didn't, and the result was suffering and death on a massive scale. The extraordinary scandals of the Trump administration—including the president's public effort to shield himself and his associates from wrongdoing—are important. But they should not blind us to the very real weight of his more ordinary transgressions. Donald Trump failed Puerto Rico, and no one should forget it.","Jonathan Ernst Donald Trump congratulated himself for his response after Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria last year.

oliviarosane,"Puerto Rico will revise the official Hurricane Maria death toll from 64 to nearly 3,000 following the release of a report by the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health (GW SPH) commissioned by the Puerto Rican government, CNN reported Tuesday. The study used data from 2010 to 2017 to predict mortality on Puerto Rico if the hurricane had not occurred and compared that figure to actual deaths on the island from September 2017 to February 2018, concluding there were 2,975 excess deaths during that period. That estimate took into account migration away from the island following the September 2017 storm. ""Even though it is an estimate, we are officially changing, or we are putting an official number to the death toll,"" Puerto Rican Gove. Ricardo Rossello told reporters Tuesday, according to CNN. ""We will take the 2,975 number as the official estimate for the excess deaths as a product of Maria."" The new official estimate comes as various studies have suggested that many more people died in the devastating storm than previous government numbers indicated. The new official number is below the around 5,000 deaths estimated by a Harvard study in May and higher than the 1,139 estimated by a research letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association earlier this month. ""I do think this study helps to validate that sense that many people had that there were just too many deaths,"" GW SPH Dean Lynn Goldman told CNN. She said the research team would conduct another phase of the study to determine which of the excess deaths were in fact caused by the hurricane. The numbers refocus attention on the Trump administration's lackluster response to the storm. ""These numbers are only the latest to underscore that the federal response to the hurricanes was disastrously inadequate and, as a result, thousands of our fellow American citizens lost their lives,"" New York Democratic Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez said in a statement reported by The Guardian. The study also adds more evidence against President Donald Trump's claim, when he visited Puerto Rico shortly after the hurricane, that the death toll was low. ""If you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died... 16 people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people,"" he said at the time, according to ABC News. In fact, the official Maria death toll now stands above the Hurricane Katrina death toll of more than 1,800, as estimated by the National Hurricane Center. The researchers covered a six-month period because so many homes were without power for an incredibly long time. The Guardian reported. Lack of power increased exposure to extreme heat without fans or air conditioning and forced people to make more physical effort. ""It's fairly striking that you have so many households without electricity for so long. That's unusual in the US after a disaster,"" Goldman said. The report found that the death rate was higher for all age groups and social spheres during the period studied, but that people living in towns with lower socioeconomic development had a risk of death 45 percent higher. Older men were also more likely to experience higher mortality rates. The Puerto Rican government also commissioned GW SPH to assess how well it implemented the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for reporting mortality in disasters and how well it communicated crisis and mortality information. The report concluded that the Puerto Rican government's lack of communication about best practices for death certificate reporting before the 2017 hurricane season, as well as a lack of awareness among doctors about how to report deaths after disasters, decreased the number of deaths attributed to the hurricane on official certificates. GW SPH also conducted interviews with Puerto Rican government staffers, and found that the Department of Public Safety (DPS) and the Central Communications Office in the Governor's Office did not have written communication plans for emergencies. Interviewees also told researchers that there were not enough communications staff before the hurricane started and that an increase in staff after the hurricane was inefficiently managed. Further, there were also no plans in place to use alternative communication channels once power cut out following the storm. Researcher Carlos Santos-Burgoa said in a statement reported by ABC News that the report could provide a template for improvements. ""We hope this report and its recommendations will help build the island's resilience and pave the way toward a plan that will protect all sectors of society in times of natural disasters,"" he said. Rosello made promises to that effect, announcing the creation of a ""9/20"" commission for determining how Puerto Rico could improve its disaster response, The Guardian reported.","EcoWatch Official Hurricane Maria Death Toll Raised to Nearly 3000 EcoWatch Puerto Rico will revise the official Hurricane Maria death toll from 64 to nearly 3,000 following the release of a report by the George Washington University Milken Institute School o…",2018-08-29T20:48:41Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ecowatch.com'}",Official Hurricane Maria Death Toll Raised to Nearly 3000 - EcoWatch,https://www.ecowatch.com/official-hurricane-maria-death-toll-raised-2599913746.html,https://ecowatchroar-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rbl.ms%2F18392124%2F980x.jpg/2000%2C2000/a7SFgMTRrWviFzqn/img.jpg,,Ecowatch.com,Hurricane Katrina,1

Bush administration are inevitable, even though Bush himself did not behave as Trump has. Trump had no way of knowing about Blasey Ford's allegation of Kavanaugh when he nominated the judge for the Supreme Court, but the President's handling of the matter has made it much worse. He has insulted her by calling her ""the woman"" and instead of asking the FBI to investigate, as Bush did with Thomas, he has said such probes are ""not the FBI's thing."" This is false. Of course, every scandal is unique, so exact comparisons to the woes of earlier presidents cannot be drawn. But the echoes are unmistakable and have become impossible to ignore. Trump's response to the Kavanaugh situation may not be quite as bad as his reaction to the study that concluded that nearly 3,000 people died because of Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico last year. The President has said that he thinks the tally is false and was developed as a political attack. Puerto Rico has accepted the findings. With Maria already regarded as his version of President George W. Bush's slow response to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, Trump's complaint confirmed that his hurricane debacle was proof of his cluelessness as well as his incompetence. Then, of course, there is the Russia investigation, where the prosecution of Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn brings to mind the classic Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon. Lesser quagmires have swallowed many of Trump's appointees. Among them: Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, resigned amid ethical scandals; former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, who resigned when his use of private jets at taxpayer expense was revealed; and Rob Porter, a White House staff secretary, who resigned when domestic abuse allegations surfaced. Porter has denied the allegations. Remarkably, only one administration official, former national security adviser Flynn, has been removed from office because of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But here, again, Trump in on pace to outperform four decades' worth of presidents. One has to go back more than 40 years, to Nixon and Watergate, to find as much evidence of campaign-related scandal as has been revealed during the Trump presidency. Campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents investigating the Russia scandal. In addition to Manafort, the campaign chairman, special counsel Robert Mueller had obtained a guilty plea from Rick Gates, who served in the Trump campaign and in the transition. Michael Cohen, who bragged about being the President's ""fixer,"" has pleaded guilty to crimes related to buying the silence of Karen MacDougal and Stormy Daniels, Trump's alleged extramarital sexual partners, in order to aid the Trump campaign. Trump has denied the affairs. Daniels is suing Trump and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, is seeking a sworn deposition from the President. Avenatti is making the same demand on behalf of another client, Summer Zervos, who was among a number of women who have alleged sexual harassment by Trump. Trump has denied the allegations of the women, including Zervos. Her defamation complaint has already put Trump in the position of having to answer written questions. The peril Trump faces in the Daniels and Zervos matters appears similar to the presidential deposition in the Paula Jones civil suit, which was a turning point in the scandal that enveloped Clinton in the late 1990s. Clinton's evasions and lying led to an impeachment trial. (Under oath, during a deposition, Clinton said that he did not have sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.) He escaped being removed from office following a trial in the US Senate. Most of Trump's problems, including the controversy affecting the Kavanaugh nomination, have recent historical precedent but the number of crises impacting his administration does not. Trump's record is all the more striking because he follows a President, Barack Obama, who suffered only one cabinet resignation due to controversy -- former CIA Director David Petraeus, who resigned after an FBI investigation confirmed that he was having an affair with his biographer -- in eight years. Coming after No Drama Obama, as he was called, Trump has been one-man chaos machine. At the White House, insiders have been so aghast at Trump that, in the words of the anonymous writer who penned the recent article in The New York Times, ""many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office."" Indeed, the man who says he knows how to find and hire the best people has presided over a team in constant turmoil. The appointees who stand between Trump and his worst instincts recognize what many of us feel. They, and we, don't need a complete accounting of the debacles to conclude that a temperamentally, intellectually and morally unfit man occupies the Oval Office.","Michael D'Antonio writes that most of President Trump's problems, including the controversy affecting Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, have recent historical precedent but the actual number of controversies impacting this one administration is unprecedented.",2018-09-21T22:43:23Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",No president has seen the number of scandals Trump has,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/21/opinions/trump-scandals-adding-up-kavanaugh-dantonio/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180820100542-donald-trump-aug-1-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Hurricane Katrina,1
Travis Fedschun,"Hurricane Harvey's torrential rains that turned streets in the nation's fourth-largest city into rivers navigable only by boat last year made the storm the second-most costly hurricane in U.S. history, according to a new report released Thursday. The National Hurricane Center said in its official 76-page report on the storm that after accounting for inflation, the storm ranks behind only Hurricane Katrina in 2005. ""The latest NOAA damage estimate from Harvey is $125 billion, with the 90% confidence interval ranging from $90 to $160 billion,"" the NHC said in its report. ""The mid-point of the estimate would tie Katrina (2005) as the costliest United States tropical cyclone, which was also $125 billion."" Harvey rapidly intensified into a category 4 hurricane at the end of August before making landfall along the middle Texas coast. The storm then stalled over the region for four days, dropping ""historic amounts of rainfall"" that resulted in the deaths of at least 68 people in Texas from the direct effects of the storm. The NHC said that number was ""the largest number of direct deaths from a tropical cyclone in that state since 1919."" Harvey's rainfall was ""truly overwhelming,"" according to the NHC, which said it was the most significant tropical cyclone rainfall event in United States history. The highest amounts of rainfall generated from the storm were a report of 60.58 inches near Nederland, Texas and another report of 60.54 inches from near Groves, Texas. HURRICANE HARVEY VICTIMS AWAIT MORE AID AS GOVERNMENT GRAPPLES WITH OTHER PRIORITIES ""Both of these values (and from five other stations) exceed the previously accepted United States tropical cyclone storm total rainfall record of 52.00 inches at Kanalohuluhulu Ranger Station, Hawaii, in August of 1950 from Hurricane Hiki,"" the NHC said. The flooding across the densely populated region caused over 300,000 structures to be flooded, with up to 500,000 vehicles also being damaged. An estimated 40,000 flood victims were evacuated to or took refuge in shelters across Texas or Louisiana, and FEMA reported that about 30,000 water rescues were conducted during disaster response to Harvey. GIRL SCOUTS LAUNCH COOKIES-4-HEROES PROGRAM FOR HURRICANE HARVEY FIRST RESPONDERS On Wednesday, the hurricane relief effort sparked by Harvey led by five former U.S. presidents that included a Texas concert with rock star Lady Gaga announced it raised more than $41 million for recovery efforts in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama attended the Oct. 21 One America Appeal fundraising concert at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. Donations went to a special account through the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library Foundation. “On behalf of the former presidents, we want to thank each of the roughly 110,500 donors who so selflessly answered the call to help our fellow Americans in need due to the devastating 2017 hurricane season,” David Jones, CEO of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library Foundation, said in a statement. “Together, we have worked very hard to get this money where it is needed quickly, and the feedback we have received from the relief organizations with whom we have partnered indicate this special appeal has indeed made an important difference.""

GLENN THRUSH,"Traditionally states, and not the federal government, have been responsible for hashing out the details of assessing damage, processing claims and distributing funding in the wake of national disasters, a system intended to give local decision makers control over how their communities are rebuilt. But states and cities, unaccustomed to dealing with the complex logistical and oversight issues of administering programs geared at fast-tracking billions in capital projects, are now finding themselves overwhelmed by the demands, even though such challenges have been well-documented since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Many of the areas most prone to repeated hurricanes, especially Louisiana, Texas, Puerto Rico, and now North Carolina, have all experienced similar problems as they adjust to a new normal in which disaster agencies are permanently mobilized and f ederal disaster money is now one of the single biggest sources of government money used to help rehabilitate or preserve low-income housing. We are really good at disaster recovery programs, hazard mitigation, helping individual people who are in trouble, but not at this kind of thing, said the states emergency management director, Michael A. Sprayberry, who contends that the lessons learned under Matthew will help the state more efficiently distribute post-Florence disaster funding. We have had to hire and stand up a completely new staff roughly 50, 60 new people so this is a whole new ballgame. It took more than 10 months to comply with federally mandated environmental reviews and other red tape, Mr. Sprayberry said, which is contributing to the frustration. There will be a news release from HUD saying that the state is going to be receiving funding, which right then sort of automatically raises the level of expectations, he added.",North Carolina has had an especially hard time distributing money earmarked by Congress to help low- and moderate-income homeowners in the wake of disasters.,2018-09-24T23:32:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","North Carolina, a ‘Slow Spender’ State, Struggles to Hand Out Storm Aid",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/us/north-carolina-florence-matthew-disaster-aid.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/us/00nchousing-02/00nchousing-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Katrina,1
AP,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) Floridas top elections official abruptly resigned Thursday after a newspaper obtained pictures of him in blackface posing as a Hurricane Katrina victim.
Secretary of State Michael Ertel, who had been on the job less than three weeks, resigned just hours after he testified about election lawsuits before a state legislative committee.
The Tallahassee Democrat obtained pictures taken at a Halloween party 14 years ago that show Ertel dressed in blackface while wearing earrings, a New Orleans Saints bandanna and fake breasts under a purple T-shirt with Katrina Victim written on it. The photos were taken two months after the deadly storm ravaged the Gulf Coast region.
Ertel had been the Seminole County supervisor of elections and was picked last month by new Gov. Ron DeSantis to take over the department that oversees elections.
DeSantis said Ertel regretted dressing up in blackface, but he said that he was right to step down after the pictures emerged.
I want people to be able to lead and not have any of these things swirling around, said DeSantis, who was in Marianna to discuss hurricane relief efforts for areas hit hard by Hurricane Michael in October.
During his campaign for governor, DeSantis came under fire from Democrats who said he made racially divisive comments about Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.
Ertel was appointed Seminole County supervisor of elections in 2005 by then-Gov. Jeb Bush and won four elections to keep the office.
DeSantis last year defeated Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who was seeking to become Floridas first black governor. Gillum questioned DeSantis association with people seen as racially divisive. DeSantis also came under fire for a comment he made in late August where he said that Florida voters shouldnt monkey this up by supporting Gillum.",Secretary of State Michael Ertel dressed in blackface at a party 14 years ago.,2019-01-24T21:33:43Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Florida Elections Chief Resigns Over Photos Posing As Hurricane Katrina Victim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-elections-chief-resigns-when-blackface-photos-emerge_us_5c4a2c7be4b0287e5b892878,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c4a2dc620000059016bbd2b.jpeg?cache=ccgm1ckh3v&ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,Hurricane Katrina,1
Nina Golgowski,"A white Louisiana man who shot three black men in a racist attack in the wake of Hurricane Katrina has died just days after he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Roland Bourgeois Jr., 56, whose legal battle over the 2005 shootings had been dragged out over concerns about his health, likely died last week from natural causes, according to officials, though an investigation remains ongoing, the Plaquemines Parish Coroners Office told HuffPost.
The cause and the manner are still pending, the offices chief investigator, Charles Guey, told HuffPost, adding that the autopsys full results are expected to take anywhere from four to six weeks.
Bourgeois was taken to a hospital after staff found him unresponsive at the Plaquemines Parish jail, the New Orleans Advocate reported. His death on Feb. 19 came just five days after he was sentenced for federal charges of committing a hate crime and illegal use of a weapon as part of a plea deal.
Bourgeois was charged in 2010 for shooting the men after they entered the Algiers Point neighborhood in New Orleans on Sept. 1, 2005. It was three days after the citys levees broke, flooding most of the city.
The victims, one of which was gravely wounded in the shooting, were attempting to reach a ferry landing that state and federal agencies had turned into an evacuation site when they were shot by Bourgeois. Charges filed against him noted that Bourgeois had hurled racial epithets before the attack and told one neighbor: Anything coming up this street darker than a brown paper bag is getting shot.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - U.S. energy firms reduced natural gas output from offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico by about 35 percent by early Wednesday as Hurricane Michael approaches the Florida coast, according to data from Refinitiv. Michael is a dangerous Category 4 storm expected to hit the Florida Panhandle later Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles (233 kilometers) per hour. A week ago, drillers were pulling about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas out of the offshore Gulf of Mexico. On Tuesday, that was down to just 2.2 bcfd, according to the Refinitiv data. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. In addition to the reduction in gas supplies, nearly 40 percent of daily crude oil production was also lost from offshore Gulf wells because of platform evacuations and shut-ins ahead of Hurricane Michael. Hurricanes, however, do not pack the same punch for the natural gas market as they did in 2005, the most active year for storms when both Katrina and Rita hit the Gulf Coast. That is because over 60 percent of the gas produced in the United States now comes from shale formations located far from the Gulf of Mexico as drillers figured out how to use hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies to extract the fuel from shale rocks. The United States is projected to produce about 81.0 bcfd of gas on average in 2018 with just 2.7 bcfd, or 3 percent of the total, expected to come from wells in the federal offshore Gulf of Mexico, according to federal data. In 2004, the year before the active 2005 hurricane season, the federal offshore Gulf of Mexico produced about 10.9 bcfd, which was 21 percent of the nation’s total gas output of 50.9 bcfd that year.

Kevin Loria,"Perez was infected with flesh-eating vibrio bacteria while wading in the brackish waters of the Maurice River. Shutterstock/dreikim Angel Perez went crabbing in New Jersey's Maurice River on July 2, as he did frequently, according to his daughter, Dilena Perez-Dilan, who spoke to local ABC News station WPVI. But a few hours after he got out of the water, Perez's leg started to blister, swell, and change to a ""brown, blackish color,"" his daughter told the news station. Perez was infected with bacteria that can cause flesh-eating disease, known as necrotizing fasciitis. A number of different bacteria can cause the infection, which causes soft tissue like skin, muscle, ligaments, blood vessels, and fat to die. The disease kills up to 30% of those infected if it's not stopped. The infection spread to Perez's other leg and both arms. Doctors at Cooper University Hospital are treating him with antibiotics and trying to save his life. The only two treatment options are antibiotics or amputation, but it's still unknown whether any or all of his limbs will have to be amputated. In this case, doctors say Perez was infected with Vibrio bacteria, which can be found in water that's brackish (meaning partially salty), especially in warm summer months. There are approximately a dozen types of Vibrio bacteria. Most cause an unpleasant condition called vibriosis that can resolve within a few days, but one rare type of Vibrio bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis. Anyone exposed to the bacteria can get infected, especially if they have open cuts or wounds. Perez reportedly has Parkinson's, which puts him at even higher risk of infection. Skin lesions caused by Vibrio vulnificus bacteria after Hurricane Katrina. CDC Vibrio, flesh-eating bacteria, and brackish water One specific form of Vibrio bacteria, Vibrio vulnificus, is especially dangerous. This infection can cause blistering skin lesions, bloodstream infections, and necrotizing fasciitis if a wound gets infected. But it's rare: the CDC estimates that there are about 205 cases in the US every year, with just a few of those in New Jersey. Vibrio is more commonly a risk for people wading through floodwaters. After Hurricane Harvey, a flesh-eating bacteria infection resulted in at least one fatality, and there were several Vibrio deaths after Hurricane Katrina. Most of the 80,000 vibriosis infections that occur in the US every year are less serious, according to the CDC. Estimates suggest 52,000 of those cases are likely the result of eating contaminated food, especially raw seafood. About 80% of those infections occur between May and October, when water is particularly warm — an ideal condition for colonies of bacteria to grow and thrive. Contaminated floodwaters can host Vibrio bacteria. Thomson Reuters Signs of the disease Necrotizing fasciitis is most often caused by group A Streptococcus bacteria and some other types. But flesh-eating disease caused by Vibrio is treated differently from other bacteria that can cause the same condition, so identifying it is important. Flesh-eating disease is one of the most common signs of Vibrio vulnificus, according to one study. People are more susceptible to necrotizing fasciitis if they have a condition or illness that weakens their immune system, as Perez does. But the bacteria usually causes infection at the site of a cut or wound regardless. Normally, the condition is accompanied by extreme pain that may start as soreness, like the feeling of a pulled muscle, but quickly becomes more severe. Spreading areas of discolored skin are a sign of the condition as well. If any of these symptoms are present after a wound appears, or if you have fever, chills, or vomiting, the CDC advises seeing a doctor for treatment immediately. In Perez's case, the family hopes he sought out treatment in time to save his limbs or his life, his daughter told NJ Advance Media.","A New Jersey man was infected with bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis, also known as flesh-eating disease, while wading in brackish river water.

https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank,"This small meteorological irony reveals big things about the Age of Trump. Fifty weeks ago, following the devastation of Hurricane Maria, which we now know killed some 3,000 Americans in Puerto Rico, Democrats on the House Government Reform Committee called for hearings into the flawed federal response to the 2017 storms in Puerto Rico. The Republican majority hemmed and hawed, dithered and stalled for nearly a year, before finally this month scheduling a hearing on 2017’s storms for Thursday — just in time for Hurricane Florence to hit the Carolina coast. FEMA administrator Brock Long, quite reasonably, canceled his appearance to deal with more pressing business. The hearing was called off. It’s a bit late to learn from 2017’s mistakes when 2018’s storms are already making landfall. Heckuva job ! This week we see two opposing forces of nature: Florence, with winds of nearly 130 mph, and President Trump’s Washington, which hardly moves at all. Trump’s response to the tragedy in Puerto Rico has been to congratulate himself for his amazingly fantastic relief efforts. On Tuesday, he celebrated his “ incredibly successful ” response to Maria, which killed about as many Americans as the 9/11 attacks. On Wednesday, he said his team “did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico,” again blaming the island territory’s infrastructure and San Juan’s “incompetent” mayor for any troubles. And the Republican majority in Congress has assisted Trump’s fiction by suppressing an investigation. Various committees held hearings on aspects of the 2017 hurricanes — though these do not appear to have focused on Puerto Rico relief or to have resulted in the release of findings. If it is true that those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it, we are up a creek in a flash flood. Trump first established his concern for Puerto Rico after the storm, when he tossed victims rolls of “ beautiful, soft towels,” telling them “you can be very proud” because only 16 people at the time had been reported killed, compared with “a real catastrophe like Katrina.” The death toll from Maria in Puerto Rico today stands at 2,975 — 1,000 more than Hurricane Katrina’s toll. Trump continued this compassionate display in June, when he used a FEMA briefing on hurricane preparedness to talk about his dealmaking abilities, his political endorsements, his fondness for coal and his upcoming summit with North Korea. He didn’t mention the dead in Puerto Rico but did assert that “our level of popularity is great.” This week, after beginning the 17th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks with a tweet disparaging the FBI and Justice Department, Trump said Puerto Rico’s governor would vouch for Trump’s “incredibly successful” hurricane response: “If you ask the governor, he’ll tell you what a great job” he did. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló responded by saying: “This was the worst natural disaster in our modern history. Our basic infrastructure was devastated, thousands of our people lost their lives and many others still struggle. Now is not the time to pass judgment.” No, judgment time was during the past year, when lawmakers could have forced FEMA to make changes. But the Senate Homeland Security committee, which has jurisdiction over the matter, had only one hearing with Long on the topic. Democratic calls in both chambers of Congress for a commission went nowhere. Democrats on the House Government Reform Committee complained this month that Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) held no full committee hearings on the hurricanes (there were two subcommittee hearings), no transcribed interviews, only three agency briefings and no briefings from White House officials; requested no documents from the White House; and issued no subpoenas. By contrast, after Katrina, then-Chairman Tom Davis (R-Va.) led a select committee that arranged nine hearings, scores of interviews and dozens of briefings and obtained numerous documents from the George W. Bush White House using subpoenas. Davis issued a 569-page report faulting the Katrina response at all levels. A Gowdy spokeswoman said the committee “has engaged with FEMA relating to its oversight and investigative work on a near-weekly basis,” had various member and staff briefings and reviewed 17,000 pages of documents from agencies. The Government Accountability Office, a research arm of Congress that has no enforcement powers, issued a report this month citing problems with debris removal, inadequate prepositioning of materials, not enough generators, insufficient housing for relief workers, staff shortages, too few bilingual employees, and employees without necessary skills or physical stamina. At the height of FEMA deployments last year, “54 percent of staff were serving in a capacity in which they did not hold the title of ‘Qualified,’ ” the GAO wrote. Even FEMA itself contradicted Trump’s claims of incredible success, saying that it was understaffed and that it needed to “ deliver our programs differently.” Let’s pray FEMA has healed itself and is now up to the task — despite the inaction of a president in denial and a Congress giving him cover.

Liza Hearon,"President Donald Trump avoided talk of hurricanes during what was supposed to have been a meeting on disaster preparedness Wednesday, holding forth on everthing but a significantly increased estimate of deaths in Puerto Rico linked to Hurricane Maria, The Washington Post reported. Leaked audio from the 40-minute meeting at Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters captured Trump musing about the cost of purchasing military equipment, attacking California Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gavin Newsom, praising Foxconn for building a factory in Wisconsin and attempting to reassure his Cabinet members that they were very popular. While speaking to the cameras for about 15 minutes, Trump briefly mentioned Puerto Rico and states hit by disasters, but didn’t address the recent Harvard study that estimated nearly 5,000 deaths on the island may be linked to Maria. The government’s official death toll from the storm was 64. Trump did, however, thank FEMA officials and Cabinet members for their response to last year’s hurricane season. “We really appreciate the job you’ve done. I want to thank you very much,” he said. The Trump administration has been heavily criticized for its response to the storm. On Wednesday, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus called for a 9/11-style commission to investigate the Puerto Rico death toll. Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) said the federal response is Trump’s “most significant failure.” Trump has in the past downplayed the effects of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, saying it wasn’t a “real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 1,800 deaths in the Gulf Coast area were directly or indirectly related to Hurricane Katrina.

Kathy Finn,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Gordon weakened after making landfall just west of the Alabama-Mississippi border and lashing the U.S. Gulf Coast with high winds and heavy rain early on Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Gordon was about 40 miles (70 km) west of Mobile, Alabama and was packing maximum sustained winds of 70 miles per hour, it said. As of early Wednesday morning, the storm had not reached 74 mph winds, the minimum to become a hurricane, and was weakening as it moved inland. The storm was expected to become a tropical depression later in the day, the NHC said. Hurricane and storm surge warnings and watches were in effect across the region, the NHC said. Though the Louisiana coast remained calm as of early Tuesday evening, Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency and companies cut 9 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production. “I’m asking all residents to do their part in getting ready for this storm,” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said in a statement. “The city’s absolute No.1 priority is to ensure the safety of our residents.” Tropical-storm force winds were already lashing the Alabama and western Florida panhandle coastlines and some areas still recovering from last year’s storms could see 12 inches (30 cm) of rain. Beaches around Mobile, Alabama were washed by storm-driven waves, said Stephen Miller, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. “We’re expecting an increase in winds,” Miller said in a telephone interview. “We could see flooding.” Sea levels could rise as much as 5 feet (1.5 m) from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama, forecasters said. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency told South Mississippi residents to be prepared to evacuate. EVACUATIONS At LaFrance Marina near Ansley, Mississippi, a mile north of Heron Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, marina owner Sue Cates said that a tidal surge is sure to push water into the marina’s low-lying campgrounds, making evacuation “the only choice” people have to protect themselves. Nevertheless, she said she and her husband will remain in their home, which sits on tall pilings, 24 feet above ground. Built after Hurricane Katrina, the home is made to withstand a 150 mile-an-hour wind, she said. “We’re way up here, and I think we’ll be OK,” Cates said. “People around here are well-trained for this sort of thing.” U.S. oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp evacuated workers and shut production at two offshore oil platforms on Monday, and other companies with production and refining operations along the Gulf Coast said they were securing facilities. The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of U.S. crude oil and 5 percent of natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.S. Coast Guard said the ports of New Orleans and Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, may have to close within 48 hours. Last year, hurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing widespread destruction and thousands of deaths. The Inn at Ocean Springs and the Roost Hotel in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, had guests planning to ride out the storm, said Kristin Smith, general manager of both hotels. “A lot of guests are real comfortable sticking it out in our rooms,” Smith said in a telephone interview. “Any of our guests who feel like they want to go home we encourage them to follow their instincts.” Reporting by Kathy Finn in NEW ORLEANS; Additional reporting by Gina Cherelus in NEW YORK, Brendan O'Brien in MILWAUKEE, Scott Malone in BOSTON and Dan Whitcomb in LOS ANGELES; Editing by Toni Reinhold, Lisa Shumaker and Darren Schuettler","Tropical Storm Gordon weakened after making landfall just west of the Alabama-Mississippi border and lashing the U.S. Gulf Coast with high winds and heavy rain early on Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.",2018-09-05T08:50:02Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}","Storm Gordon hits near Alabama-Mississippi border, seen weakening",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-gordon/storm-gordon-hits-near-alabama-mississippi-border-seen-weakening-idUSKCN1LL0W6,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180905&t=2&i=1300894946&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE840HM,reuters,Reuters,Hurricane Katrina,1
PAUL KRUGMAN,"At the trivial but still telling end of the scale, we have the tale of Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who keeps flying first class at taxpayers’ expense. The money isn’t the important issue here, although his spending violates federal guidelines. The revealing thing, instead, is the supposed reason he needs to fly premium — you see, ordinary coach passengers have been known to say critical things to his face. Remember this story the next time someone talks about liberal “snowflakes.” More seriously, consider the behavior of John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff, whose record of slandering critics and refusing to admit error is starting to rival his boss’s. Remember when Kelly made false accusations about Representative Frederica Wilson and refused to retract those accusations even after video showed they were false? More recently, Kelly insisted that he didn’t know the full details about domestic abuse allegations against Rob Porter until, a White House staff member said, “ 40 minutes before he threw him out ” — a claim that seems at odds with everything we know about this story. Even if this claim were true, an apology for his obliviousness seems in order. But these guys don’t apologize. Oh, and by the way: Roy Moore still hasn’t conceded. So it’s not just Trump. And it didn’t start with Trump. In fact, way back in 2006 I wrote about the “ mensch gap ” in the Bush administration — the unwillingness of top officials to accept responsibility for the botched occupation of Iraq, the botched response to Hurricane Katrina, and more. Nor, by the way, are we only talking about politicians. In my neck of the woods, I remain amazed by the unwillingness of right-leaning economists to admit that they were wrong in predicting that the Fed’s efforts to rescue the economy would cause runaway inflation. Being wrong is one thing — it happens to everyone, myself very much included. Refusing to admit and learn from error is something different. And let’s be clear: Personal responsibility isn’t dead everywhere. You can ask, for example, whether Hillary Clinton apologized sufficiently for her initial support of the Iraq war or her missteps in 2016 — but she did admit to making mistakes, which nobody on the other side ever seems to do. So what happened to the character of the G.O.P.? I’m pretty sure that in this case the personal is, ultimately, political. The modern G.O.P. is, to an extent never before seen in American history, a party built around bad faith, around pretending that its concerns and goals are very different from what they really are. Flag-waving claims of patriotism, pious invocations of morality, stern warnings about fiscal probity are all cover stories for an underlying agenda mainly concerned with making plutocrats even richer. And the character flaws of the party end up being echoed by the character flaws of its most prominent members. Are they bad people who chose their political affiliation because it fits their proclivities, or potentially good people corrupted by the company they keep? Probably some of both. In any case, let’s be clear: America in 2018 is not a place where we can disagree without being disagreeable, where there are good people and good ideas on both sides, or whatever other bipartisan homily you want to recite. We are, instead, living in a kakistocracy, a nation ruled by the worst, and we need to face up to that unpleasant reality.

Matt Simon,"For the Inuit of Labrador in Canada, climate disaster has already arrived. These indigenous people form an intense bond with their land, hunting for food and fur. “People like to go out on the land to feel good,” says Noah Nochasak in the documentary Lament for the Land. “If they can’t go out on the land, travel a long ways to feel good, they don’t feel like people.” The Inuit’s lands, though, are warming twice as fast as the global average, imperiling the ice they rely on to travel. In the fall, hunters tend to get stuck in the community, because ice hasn’t fully formed up—and again, in the spring, when things are melting. Climate change is making these ice transition periods even longer. “During those times historically, there has been some increases in suicide or suicide attempts or ideation in the communities,” says Ashlee Cunsolo, a health geographer who has studied the region. “There is a lot of concern among the mental health practitioners. What does that mean if this time is lengthened from two weeks to eight weeks?” It’s known as ecological grief—the mourning of ecosystems and species and ways of life that are disappearing as the planet warms. But it isn’t just hitting the Inuit. As our planet plays host to rising seas, more intense storms, and higher temperatures, those conditions will support a growing international mental health crisis. “Things like depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, domestic abuse, all these things tend to go up in the aftermath of a natural disasters,” says psychologist Susan Clayton of the College of Wooster, co-author of an extensive report on climate change and mental health. “As we have more natural disasters, one would expect to also have increases in those kinds of mental health consequences.” Take Hurricane Katrina. In its aftermath, a sample of survivors found one in six met the criteria for PTSD. Rates of suicide and suicidal thoughts doubled. And especially in refugee situations, those mental health challenges can be intimately tied to physical health, compounding the harm. “When people are moving to places they bring diseases with them that the home population might not be immune to, and on the flip side these people are moving into places where they might not have immunity to the diseases in the new place,” says Jonathan Patz, director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin. Even those whose homes aren’t directly threatened by sea level rise or fiercer hurricanes aren’t immune. By the end of the century, the average American will have to endure four to eight times the number of 95+ degree days. Arizonans will get it particularly bad: Their number of 95+ degree days a year will leap from an average of 116 to over 200. And several studies have made a link between higher temperatures and higher rates of suicide. One particularly data-intensive survey recently published in Nature Climate Change compiled temperatures and suicide statistics on the county level for the US, and municipality level for Mexico. They compared these granular regions not with each other, but with themselves—so the average monthly temperature in Palo Alto in July 2009 versus July 2010. This controlled for differences between locations in factors like poverty rates or gun ownership rates, both of which have been tied to suicide rates. The uptick in suicide rates the researchers found may be small—a rise of 2 percent in Mexico and.7 percent in the US for every additional degree Celsius in average monthly temperature—and the relationship is far from simple. Rates of suicide fluctuate around the world, and where those suicide rates are highest, the temperature isn’t necessarily the highest. But extrapolated forward, the impact on public health could be devastating. “The fact that our results are so consistent across different socioeconomic strata, across different populations, suggests a common biological response,” says Stanford economist Marshall Burke, lead author of the study. It's unclear if scientists will unearth shared mechanisms behind the mental health effects of climate-related trauma. But the experience itself is obviously, intuitively human. When Cunsolo and a colleague published an essay in Nature Climate Change earlier this year on ecological grief, the email response they got was huge, and it was cosmopolitan. “It wasn't drought-affected farmers, it wasn't low-lying island states, it wasn't people who had been forced to relocate, it was people often living in urban settings would describe this overall sense of despair and anxiety,” says Cunsolo. The root of our shared problem may be the same, but the manifestations of climate change can be wildly different. “Each region, each place, each culture, is going to experience something very, very different,” says Cunsolo. For the Inuit, it’s about ice. For the Southern US, it’s supercharged hurricanes. As with all health care, prevention is the best medicine. But in the case of climate change, we may be too late.

In calculating its records, NOAA compares years since 1980, when the agency began looking at the costs of disasters. Data on some disasters could also still be forthcoming, especially on the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, said Adam Smith, an economist at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. This is not that unusual. Data from damage due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was still pouring in several months after the storm.

Wynne Davis,"In February, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band's sousaphone was stolen after a performance, but with the help of an anonymous tipster the instrument and band have been reunited. Lee Celano/Getty Images Big black and white letters that spelled out ""Preservation Hall New Orleans"" made the jazz band's sousaphone hard to miss. That was, at least, until it went missing. ""If you're trying to identify the sound of the tuba in one of our recordings or when you hear us live, you listen to the low end,"" tuba player Ben Jaffe says. ""You listen for the bass, you listen for the bottom, the thing that carries the band. It's the rhythmic and harmonic foundation of the band."" Now, a little more than two weeks after the band announced the iconic sousaphone was stolen, the fundamental instrument is back in the group's possession. Jaffe says when the instrument went missing it was just after a performance at the Music Box, a venue in the city. ""We were packing up our vehicle, it was late at night, and I guess none of us were really paying close attention, but somewhere during this span of 45 minutes the Preservation Hall tuba disappeared."" When they realized it was missing they searched all the obvious places, but they couldn't find it, so they decided to reach out to the community for help — and it worked. ""Someone who had read the newspaper, spotted the horn and contacted us anonymously and through that tip we were able to retrieve the instrument,"" Jaffe says."" Like with many musicians, Jaffe's horn has special meaning to him. ""I purchased my horn shortly after Hurricane Katrina,"" Jaffe says. ""I lost my instruments in Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago."" After that Jaffe says the tuba "" just became a part of me."" ""It's traveled the world several times with me. It's played on all of our recordings. It's been on all of our concerts,"" he says. ""Every little nick and ding on that horn has a story behind it from a different place in the world, a different memory."" The Preservation Hall tuba was returned on Monday after an anonymous tipster spotted the horn and contacted the band. ""I spent the day cleaning the horn and getting the valves working again,"" Jaffe says. ""There was some damage to the valves and there was some damage that I'm going to have to ship the horn to a specialist to have it overhauled, but I got the horn into playing condition."" Jaffe says even though the horn sustained some damage he is excited to have it back and play what notes he can — and that, calls for some fanfare.

"FactCheck.org, Robert Farley, FactCheck.org","President Donald Trump claims that Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane and that it received more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before. Neither of those statements is true.
According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as of the end of last year, Puerto Rico had actually received about $11.2 billion in disaster relief payments since 2017.
In all, the federal government has allocated nearly $41 billion, and has obligated about half of it via binding agreements, but as we said, so far just a portion of that  $11.2 billion  has been distributed in Puerto Rico.
To get to the $91 billion figure, a senior administration official told us Trump is including the total allocation for Puerto Rico  $41 billion  plus an estimated $50 billion in future FEMA costs over the life of the disaster, which can stretch decades.
It is accurate to say that $41 billion has been allocated and there will likely be billions more, Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us via email. But to just add up actual appropriations (most of which has not actually [been] obligated, much less cash on the ground) to some future cost estimates seems inaccurate to me.

The president is also wrong to say Puerto Rico got more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before. The federal government spent more on Hurricane Katrina aid.
Trumps claim  which he made via a tweet  came as Republicans and Democrats butt heads on disaster aid proposals, with Democrats seeking more aid for Puerto Rico, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017.
Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, &amp; all their local politicians do is complain &amp; ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, &amp; only take from USA....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019
....The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019
Trump has used this $91 billion figure before. He cited it in a meeting with Republican senators on March 26, and again on March 28, telling reporters, Ive taken better care of Puerto Rico than any man ever. We have $91 billion going to Puerto Rico. We have $29 billion to Texas and $12 billion to Florida for the hurricanes.
We asked the White House how Trump arrived at the $91 billion figure, and a senior administration official broke it down to us like this: $14 billion in FEMA allocations to date, plus $26 billion in non-FEMA allocations  for a total of $41 billion allocated for Puerto Rico disaster relief.
For more details, the official pointed us to FEMAs Spending Explorer website, which allows users to track disaster aid by state appropriated in 2017 and 2018. It tracks spending in three categories: allocated (which means Congress has appropriated the funds), obligated (which means the government has entered a binding agreement to award funding), and outlayed (which means the money has actually been paid).
As we said, the FEMA calculator shows only $11.2 billion of the $41 billion allocated for Puerto Rico disaster relief has been paid so far. (We should note that not all disaster relief going to Puerto Rico is directly tied to Hurricane Maria. The appropriations also include relief from Hurricane Irma, which was much less severe for Puerto Rico, but which also caused some damage.)
But to get to $91 billion, the senior administration official told us, the president is also adding $50 billion, the estimated future FEMA costs over the life of the disaster. The official referred us to a report from the Washington Post Fact Checker that said the $50 billion was an internal Office of Management and Budget estimate of the potential liabilities over the life of the disaster that would need to be committed under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988, which governs federal disaster response in the U.S. The Post added that the estimate was described as a high-end estimate subject to change year by year.
Stafford Act claims can be paid out for decades, and future claims are very difficult to quantify, a House Appropriations Committee spokesperson told us.
Post-disaster federal funding comes from two main sources, the Disaster Relief Fund and supplemental appropriations, according to Ellis. By the end of 2019, FEMA estimates that a little less than $21 billion will have gone to Puerto Rico from the Disaster Relief Fund as a result of Maria (with another $3.6 billion going to the Virgin Islands).
By comparison, FEMA to date has spent more than $50 billion from the Disaster Relief Fund as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, including $32.6 billion to Louisiana. Ellis notes that nearly $200 million in Katrina-related disaster aid will come from the relief fund this year, which gives you an idea of how long these funds trickle in.
The appropriated funds are harder to track, Ellis said. In addition to Katrina, there were two other major storms in the U.S. in 2005, Rita and Wilma. And in addition to Maria, Hurricane Irma made landfall the same year in 2017. The funds for multiple storms can go into the same accounts, making it hard to track aid for particular storms.
The Congressional Research Service estimates that, in all, Congress provided roughly $120 billion for Hurricane Katrina. So even if the presidents long-term cost estimate for Puerto Rico pans out, it would still be less than what was spent by the federal government on Katrina.
Comparing money allocated after storms also needs to account for the severity of the storms, and how much damage they cause.
Although the federal spending for disaster relief in Florida and Texas has been lower, as the president noted, those storms also caused less damage than Maria did in Puerto Rico.
According to a study published in the journal BMJ Global Health on Jan. 18, the federal government responded on a larger scale and much more quickly across measures of federal money and staffing to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Texas and Florida, compared with Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. The variation in the responses was not commensurate with storm severity and need after landfall in the case of Puerto Rico compared with Texas and Florida.

Add Hurricanes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricanes news, video, and analysis from ABC News. This year had triple the usual amount of major hurricanes: six major hurricanes, as opposed to the norm of two. In total, there were 10 hurricanes this year and 17 named storms. For the first time on record, three Category 4 hurricanes made landfall in the U.S.: Harvey, Irma and Maria. September 2017, was the most active month on record for Atlantic hurricanes. Here are more facts and records about the 2017 hurricane season: Irma With winds reaching up to 185 mph, Hurricane Irma was the second-strongest hurricane in the Atlantic Basin in history. It set a world record for the longest-lasting, strongest cyclone. Irma was also the strongest storm to impact the Leeward Islands, on the border of the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, in recorded history. The monster storm completely destroyed the Caribbean island of Barbuda with 185 mph winds; it was also the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since 1924 and the first to hit the Bahamas since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. When Hurricane Irma made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, as a Category 4 hurricane, it still had winds up to 130 mph. It was the first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in Florida since hurricane Charlie 2004. The hurricane's second landfall in Florida was on Marco Island as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115. GRAPHIC: In this graphic, shows the path of Hurricane Irma.

Maria Hurricane Maria increased strength very rapidly, ramping up from a Category 1 storm to Category 5 in just 15 hours. At its strongest, Maria's winds reached 175 mph. Maria hit the island of Dominica on Sept. 18, the first Category 5 storm to make landfall there, with winds up to 160 mph. The island was nearly completely restored. On the island of St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Maria's winds gusted up to 137 mph. In Puerto Rico, winds gusted to 110 mph, in San Juan, and rainfall totaled 35 inches causing some rivers to rise 20 feet in just a few hours. On September 20, the storm made landfall in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, as a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 155 mph. Maria was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico since 1928.

Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico as a high-end category 4 hurricane on Sept. 19, causing 31 deaths in Dominica and 65 in Puerto Rico, according to the NOAA. Maria is the third costliest hurricane in U.S. history, behind Harvey and Katrina. In early October, Nate's rainfall inundated Central America and killed 45 before it made landfall on the northern Gulf Coast as a category 1 hurricane. The hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, and a pre-season forecast released last week from Colorado State University’s Tropical Meteorology Project calls for 14 named storms. Seven are predicted to strengthen into hurricanes, with three becoming major storms that are Category 3 or higher. The research team predicts that 2018 hurricane activity will be about 135 percent of the average season. PUERTO RICO IN 'FRAGILE STATE' SIX MONTHS AFTER HURRICANE MARIA By comparison, 2017’s hurricane season was approximately 245 percent of the average season and featured Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which devastated parts of the United States and portions of the Caribbean. The 2018 Atlantic Hurricane Season includes the names: Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, Ernesto, Florence, Gordon, Helene, Isaac, Joyce, Kirk, Leslie, Michael, Nadine, Oscar, Patty, Rafael, Sara, Tony, Valerie and William.

Jacob Kastrenakes,"I finally caught the first Deadpool earlier this week on a plane back from Florida. I was worried they’d end up censoring a bunch of the movie, but it seems like most of the film made it through, with just a couple of blurred butts. I’ve realized more and more lately that I think self-aware action films, which are able to play off the genre’s conventions, are often way more more fun and interesting than serious ones. Deadpool reminded me a lot of the two Kingsman films; they’re far from all-out comedies, but they know where to wink and nod in ways that move the story along and turn otherwise tired archetypes into entertaining roles. To a degree, that’s something Marvel has tapped into well, too. Its films are serious, but they’re never too serious. And many of them, like the latest Thor, are as concerned with having fun as they are with letting the hero take down another villain. In the end, that often works out, because it’s easier to connect with the characters and root for them to succeed. Check out nine trailers from this week below. Cut Throat City RZA directs this heist film about four friends in New Orleans who find themselves abandoned after Hurricane Katrina. It looks like a smart twist on the genre that embeds its action inside a much bigger and more interesting story. It comes out some time next year. Alita: Battle Angel This continues to be my least favorite film to look at, with its latest trailer showing even more of its saccharine, dreamy world filled with loads of uncanny-valley CGI. Maybe it’ll end up having some super cool action, but I find the style so weird that I struggle to pay attention. It comes out December 21st. Slender Man In a lot of ways, Slender Man looks just like a typical horror film. But I’m also fascinated by what it could potentially bring to the table thanks to its origin as a creepypasta tale. The film’s delay and low-key marketing make me think it might not live up to its potential, though. It comes out August 10th. Mid90s Mid90s is the first film written and directed by Jonah Hill, and it is not at all what I expected. It’s an awkward, difficult movie about the weirdness of adolescence and figuring yourself out that looks like it was shot on 16mm — like seriously, instead of making the big, stupid comedy Hill could have easily gotten huge actors to be in, he decided to make a movie that would fit right in at Sundance two decades ago. And I’m super into it. It also looks like it’ll make a nice companion piece to the excellent Skate Kitchen. It comes out October 19th. The Night is Short, Walk On Girl One of anime director Masaaki Yuasa’s latest films is coming to the US, and it looks like it could be a lot of fun. The film very much seems to follow the tropes of a quirky rom com, but it infuses that narrative with some hugely colorful characters — not to mention some colorful and ever-changing art. It comes out on August 21st. I Think We’re Alone Now Here’s a first, very mysterious teaser for I Think We’re Alone Now, a film that has Peter Dinklage starring as someone who’s supposedly one of the last people on Earth — until another person (played by Elle Fanning) shows up. The film was directed by Reed Morano, who became the first woman in 22 years to win an Emmy for directing a drama for the first three episodes of The Handmaid’s Tale last year. It comes out September 21st. The First Sean Penn is the star of a new series headed to Hulu that imagines the experience of the first astronauts headed to Mars. The show comes from House of Cards creator Beau Willimon, but it certainly looks a lot more hopeful about humanity than his last show. The series starts September 14th. Bad Reputation A new documentary traces the life and career of Joan Jett, honing in on the struggles that come with being one of the few female rockstars of the ’70s and ’80s. The film comes from longtime music video director Kevin Kerslake, who’s previously worked with Jett, and speaks with Jett herself for all the gritty details. It comes out September 28th. The Happy Prince Sony is putting out a biopic about the final years of Oscar Wilde’s life that focuses on his fight to have others accept his sexual orientation and the aftermath of his imprisonment for being gay. Rupert Everett writes, stars, and directs what looks like a dreamy exploration of the famous writer. It comes out in the US on October 5th.","Come for RZA, stay for Jonah Hill’s 90’s skate movie.",2018-07-28T16:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",9 new trailers you should watch this week,https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/28/17623178/new-trailers-slender-man-alita-battle-angel-cut-throat-city,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sucDg3aExPx-kf1S5lXJTuNFSaI=/0x102:1425x848/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11833457/slenderman.png,the-verge,The Verge,Hurricane Katrina,1
Chris Wilson,"The 2018 hurricane season in the Atlantic, which officially kicks off June 1, is expected to be of average to above-average in intensity, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization’s annual hurricane forecast released Thursday. The NOAA scientists’ complex model predicts there will be 10 to 16 storms this year that reach wind speeds of at least 39 mph, earning them a climatological name. Of those storms, five to nine are predicted to mature into hurricanes, with winds reaching 74 mph, while one to four of those will graduate to “major” status of at least category 3 on the five-point severity scale, with wind speeds of at least 111 mph. And there’s reason to believe this is a likely possibility. A TIME examination of the past 15 years of NOAA’s forecasts found that the agency’s predictions of the number of significant storms, which are provided as high and low estimates, are usually correct or close to correct, with some major exceptions. In May of 2017, for example, NOAA predicted 11-17 named storms and 5-9 hurricanes, of which 2-4 would become major hurricanes. According to our analysis of the National Hurricane Center’s detailed database of all Atlantic storms, there were in fact 17 cyclones that reached tropical storm status, 10 of which became hurricanes and six of which were major hurricanes, including Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria. That puts the estimates off by only a small margin, breaking a three-year streak in which NOAA’s estimates in all three categories had been correct. The following visualization shows the estimates as bars from low to high predictions, mapped against dots representing the actual number of storms. Any line of dots that ends inside the bar means NOAA’s estimate was correct. Note that the green dots include all storms, while the orange dots above are the subset that became hurricanes, and the red are the subset that were major hurricanes. NOAA’s climate scientists release these estimates every May and update them later in the hurricane season. They using a cascade of data from many sources — satellite data, historical patterns, aircraft observations, ocean buoys and many others — to feed a model of ever-growing complexity. “We use all the data we can get,” says Dr. Gerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. The estimates that NOAA’s model produces are accurate about 70 percent of the time, its developers say, and are often only off by one or two storms outside the projected range. In the mythically tricky world of predicting the weather even a day in advance, this is not a bad track record. The estimates from TIME’s analysis found that 28 of the NOAA’s 45 estimates, or 62 percent, were correct, while the average error was about 3 years high or low — a figure driven up by dramatic underestimates in 2005, the year of Hurricane Katrina, and dramatic overestimates in a comparatively quiet 2006. An average hurricane season in recent years is defined as 12 named storms, six of which are hurricanes and three of which are major hurricanes. “We’ve gone a long ways to improving confidence in these seasonal outlooks,” Bell says. But he acknowledged that even 100% accuracy in predicting the number of storms and their windspeed would not obviate the need for precautions in hurricane-prone areas. “We cannot predict how many of these storms will actually make landfall,” he cautions.",A TIME analysis found that the agency's hurricane predictions are often correct,2018-05-24T19:17:28Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",The NOAA’s 2018 Hurricane Forecast Is Out.

Jason Parham,"Spike Lee's white-hot genre mash-up BlacKkKlansman initiates its course in the early 1970s. It's a time “marked by the spread of integration and miscegenation,” according to an unnamed race theorist in the opening sequence (he’s played with palpable animosity by Alec Baldwin). In Colorado Springs, he continues, a sect of “true, white Americans” sense a movement brewing among black “radicals” and Jews who they feel have “pressured their great way of life.” The proto-MAGA sentiment is but a backdrop, one of many ways Lee's latest joint teases out the resonances between then and now. The parallels aren't simply the work of a fabulist, though; the playfully urgent film is inspired by real events—as Lee styles it, “some fo’ real, fo’ real shit”. Elsewhere in Colorado Springs, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is at a crossroads. The first black officer on the Colorado Springs Police Force, he's overcome the department's internal racism to attain the rank of a detective, but an assignment has left him with mixed allegiances, torn between his work and the world. It’s not until he comes across an ad in the paper from the Ku Klux Klan that it all clicks—call them, and pretend to be white. With a jazzman’s knack for grandiosity, one that’s more Charlie Parker bebop than Miles Davis cool, Lee understands tone better than most filmmakers of his generation. Over his career, he has found ways to bring sound and color into symmetry as well as discord, and to derive power from both. He’s got an appetite for climax, and has matured into a shameless, incessant provocateur—a skill that has anchored some his best works, from Do the Right Thing to Malcolm X to When The Levees Broke, his 2006 documentary about the havoc Hurricane Katrina wreaked on New Orleans. Produced by Jordan Peele, who first brought the concept to Lee, BlacKkKlansman is similarly ambitious and gripping for how it illustrates its core statement: revealing just how identity is weaponized for and against us. Over time, Ron learns that KKK Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace, with a perfectly tuned aww-shucks innocence) wants to “sell hate” and cleanse the nation under issues of affirmative action, immigration, and black radicalism. In one of their earliest conversations, Duke praises Ron for speaking “the King’s English” and not “jive.” The beauty here is the distance, or lack thereof, between Ron’s over-the-phone voice versus his in-person voice. Unlike the broadness of Sorry to Bother You ’s “white voice” play, Stallworth’s two tongues don’t clash as much as someone like Duke expects. It’s a critique made all the more searing by Washington’s subtlety—the notion of “you’re so articulate” is turned on its head and ground into ash. For Washington’s Ron Stallworth, it’s not a matter of code-switching, but one of ownership: the King’s English is his too. But a voice can’t infiltrate the KKK without a body, and proxy comes by way of Stallworth's veteran colleague Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), who begins to attend Klan meetings as Stallworth. The problem is, Zimmerman is Jewish, which one member begins to suspect. While Flip wasn’t raised in a devout household and doesn’t practice Judaism, the mounting threat has brought his Jewishness front of mind. “I never thought about it before,” he confesses to Ron, but now “I’m thinking about it all the time.” Lee is a master puppeteer when it comes to having his characters engage the battleground of selfhood—how they are sharpened by it, trapped by it, made new by it. Over his career, Lee has found ways to bring sound and color into symmetry as well as discord, and to derive power from both. “Infiltrate Hate” is the film’s tagline, and it bears the same deceptive fragrance of 2018: a time of history-rattling infringements against the powerless. Politically, the film works to map the trajectory to our current predicament. Donald Trump. Charlottesville. The spread of poisonous racial dogmas masked in slogans like “America First.” The film is largely about the influence, and infection, of propaganda into the American center, underlying how charlatan, racist figures commandeer authority with a serpent’s fang. Footage from D.W. Griffith’s 1915 feature Birth of a Nation pulse throughout the two-hour flick, and the friction of Lee’s message against Griffith’s culminates into a movie of dense and difficult candor. As a trio of Klan members set out to bomb local Black Student Union members, the film crackles and scintillates, and only briefly sputters—but never once does it lose the fire of its drive. With heat and purpose, BlacKkKlansman manifests as Lee’s most triumphant feature since 2006’s Inside Man. It doesn't just pack the visual audacity of a modern Blaxploitation epic, but—with Lee’s tongue-slick message of overthrowing The Man—the framework as well. The film moves with patience until, just as you’ve settled into Colorado’s cinematic landscape, catapults to a climactic end. Footage from 2017’s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia occupy the film’s closing scenes (it’s no coincidence that Lee is releasing the movie on its anniversary). Sitting in the theater, I again found myself struck by the horror of the images. And in this, a film about propaganda becomes a piece of potent propaganda itself. It’s up to you which message you choose to hear.

Eliza Relman,"White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley called Puerto Rico, a US territory whose citizens are American, ""that country"" twice during a Tuesday interview. 
 Gidley made the comments after President Donald Trump attacked Puerto Rico's leaders in a series of Tuesday morning tweets and accused the island of mismanaging disaster relief funds in the wake of the devastating Hurricane Maria in September 2017. 
 Gidley reiterated the president's argument and called claims that Trump has ""other-ized"" Puerto Ricans ""ridiculous."" 
 ""They have had a systematic mismanagement of the goods and services we've sent to them,"" Gidley told MSNBC's Hallie Jackson. ""Their governor has done a horrible job ... He's trying to find someone to take the blame off of him for not having a grid and not having a good system in that country."" 
 Gidley later said the phrasing was ""a slip of the tongue."" 
 At another point in the MSNBC interview, Jackson accused Gidley of rolling his eyes when she said that Puerto Ricans are US citizens. 
 ""The president says Puerto Ricans are taking from the USA. Puerto Rico is part of the United States,"" Jackson said, referring to the president's Tuesday tweet. ""There's a lot of confusion over why the president would say this and what he understands and how he views the people of Puerto Rico."" 
 ""That's ridiculous,"" Gidley responded. ""He's actually already traveled to Puerto Rico after this horrific hurricane — he was there.""

 Trump attacked Democrats on Tuesday morning for opposing a Republican disaster-relief bill for victims of hurricanes, wild fires, and other natural disasters across the country that Democrats argued didn't include enough food assistance for Puerto Rico. Republicans simultaneously opposed a version passed by House Democrats that included significantly more funding for Puerto Rico. 
 ""Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, &amp; all their local politicians do is complain &amp; ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, &amp; only take from USA,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning, adding that Puerto Rico's governor is ""crazed and incompetent."" 
 Puerto Rico has not, in fact, received $91 billion in aid following the hurricane and the administration told the Washington Post that the figure was a high-end estimate for the total amount that will be needed over time. The island has so far received about $11 billion and a total of $41 billion in aid has been committed. 
 In comparison, the US government spent more than $120 billion on recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina. 
 The president went on, ""The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted."" 
 In recent months, Trump has disputed Puerto Rico's death toll following the hurricane, falsely accused Puerto Rico of using its disaster relief funds to pay off its debt, and proposed redirecting disaster-relief funds to his border wall construction.","White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley called Puerto Rico, a US territory whose citizens are American, ""that country"" twice during a Tuesday interview.

Anne Gisleson,"The other night at a neighborhood library event in New Orleans, someone asked me if I was experiencing any PTSD from the media coverage of Florence churning toward the Carolinas. While the images were similar to Katrina in their alarming scope, the answer was actually “no.” Thirteen years living in the aftermath of a natural and man-made disaster, you can develop a sort of deep weariness, an almost philosophical detachment in response to new threats. You’ve seen the destruction, experienced the loss and witnessed how the rebuilding plays out over time—the positive changes and the enduring challenges, the heroic actors and the corrupt. Florence won’t reopen the wound, because the wound never closed. Not really. Katrina simply is our lives, whether we consciously acknowledge it or not. The storm persists on the front page of the paper: Katrina-damaged buildings still undeveloped, Katrina criminal cases still unresolved. Our younger son goes to a school struggling under the wholesale remaking of the public education system. Our older son, after having grown up in the messiness of the reconstruction, recently chose Denver for college, enamored of the intact, healthy and high-functioning city. The storm altered the trajectories of families, neighborhoods, and communities. The thought of hundreds of thousands of people resetting their lives after Florence, with unknown results, just as with Harvey and Maria last year, can be exhausting when you’ve experienced something similar firsthand. But part of that calm detachment I feel comes from knowing that, for the most part, for most people, things are eventually going to be okay, will eventually seem “normal.” It’s just the getting there that can be tough. Around the fifth anniversary of Katrina I helped write and edit How to Rebuild a City: Field Guide from a Work in Progress, a citizens-eye view of post-storm New Orleans. From our collective experience, here’s what might prove helpful—right after the storm, and even long after the TV cameras are gone. Make space for your sanity in the immediate stress of the disaster; don’t watch too much television. Some self-medication is permissible. Gutting houses and clearing debris (your former life) is exhausting. Take time out for yourself—nature walks, out of town trips, pedicures. Try to keep organized and document everything. This is so much easier now with the ubiquity of smart phones. Stay on top of the insurance adjusters. Also: write things down, not only for the adjusters, but because it helps keep your overloaded brain focused. Set attainable goals. Mourn when you need to. Don’t wait around for the city or country to replace the street signs—make your own. Are the Red Cross trucks scarce in your neighborhood? Organize your own relief effort. Assemble an armada of buddies on lawn mowers and mow the neglected parks. Papers not reporting something important? Become a citizen journalist. If civic resources are taxed, you can marshal your community resources and step in. Identify the obstacles to your recovery and pool resources and knowledge with other equally fired-up individuals. Get involved in your neighbor organization, or other community groups. After a disaster, you can lose years of your life to meetings, but it’s important to physically connect with others, and a community’s needs can be amplified if given a collective voice. The potential loss of culture in the face of mass displacement and devastation is a real danger to a community’s being, its identity. Help those restaurants re-open. Encourage the art installations and book projects and free concerts. Poets are the cultural first responders; attend their readings. Filmmakers will be everywhere. Make sure they get your story right. Be prepared for the long haul. Or decide you can’t bear it: A generation of rebuilding isn’t for everyone, and that’s fine too. The option of taking the insurance money (fingers crossed) and moving to a less threatened environment is a perfectly reasonable option. Though you will be missed, and people might resent you for a while. Or, tragically, as in the case of Katrina, some people just won’t be able to return, too many things barring their path home. At that neighborhood library event the other night, the organizer mentioned that the evening’s program was based on one I’d helped put together at another library branch ten years before—a post Katrina endeavor among family and neighbors to bring some activity and energy back to the battered area. It was so gratifying that the effort had generated and regenerated over the years, from one library to another. None of this will likely give any comfort to anyone when Florence disintegrates, the water and winds recede, and you’re facing an overwhelming wreck. The storm may change your reality forever. But if you’re lucky, years down the line, you’ll find that generosity, gratitude, and tenacity have outlasted the storm’s physical destruction.",A Katrina survivor shares wisdom for those left rebuilding after Florence,2018-09-17T10:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Advice for After the Hurricane,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/advice-for-after-the-hurricane/570373/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/09/RTRO5AH/facebook.jpg?1536955848,,Theatlantic.com,Hurricane Katrina,1
Gary Bredow,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. Monique Greenwood and her husband Glenn Pogue stayed in their first bed and breakfast in 1985. Six years later, while working as editor-in-chief of Essence magazine, Greenwood stumbled upon a dilapidated mansion in her Brooklyn, N.Y. neighborhood that she was determined to turn into their own B&amp;B. After three years of red tape, the couple purchased the 18-room mansion and began renovations. Akwaaba Bed and Breakfast opened on July 4, 1995 as a declaration of their entrepreneurial independence. In the following years, the couple opened Akwaaba by the Sea with two locations in Cape May, N.J., Akwaaba D.C. and Akwaaba in the Bayou, which they sold shortly after Hurricane Katrina. Their most ambitious acquisition to date, Akwaaba's Mansion at Noble Lane in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains, is the site of the couples new reality show Checked Inn on the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN).

Mark Frauenfelder,"Little Ripper is a remote controlled multicopter that carries a floatation device. On its first day of service off the coast of Lennox Head in Australia, the drone was used to drop a floatation device for two boys in distress. In a little over a minute, a lifeguard supervisor had launched the drone, spotted the boys, flew it over to them, and remotely dropped the flotation device. The boys were able to grab it and swim to shore. The drone is manufactured by a company called Little Ripper Lifesaver, founded by Kevin Weldon after he witnessed a drone canvassing the streets of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and realized its lifesaving potential. The Marine Pod dropped over Lennox Head contained a water-triggered flotation device, which is repackable and reusable. The company is now testing a saltwater-activated electromagnetic shark repellent device, with plans to include that in future kits.","Little Ripper is a remote controlled multicopter that carries a floatation device.

Peter Kotecki,"With Hurricane Michael making landfall Wednesday afternoon, the Florida Panhandle is facing the possibility of additional complications from a toxic ""red tide"" algae bloom. The red tide has been plaguing the Gulf of Mexico since last fall, turning clean coastlines a mud-red color and killing off wildlife. Waters on the southwest coast of Florida have been in this state for months, and the red tide has reportedly spread to the Miami area. In addition to killing marine life, the toxic algae can cause respiratory problems among people, especially those with asthma. The Florida Panhandle has already high levels of the toxic algae this year. Hurricane Michael could push the red tide inland and expose more of Florida's population to the problem, Bloomberg reported. ""A storm surge or king tide could bring red tide up onto land,"" Larry Brand, a professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami, told Bloomberg. ""The toxin would get into the air and people would be breathing it."" The health effects are hard to predict because this is the first time a severe hurricane has hit Florida amid a serious red tide, according to Bloomberg. Michael is the strongest storm to hit the United States since 1969 — stronger than both Hurricanes Katrina and Andrew. It is expected to bring a storm surge of up to 14 feet in some areas. Some scientists, however, say the algae will die soon after going inland. Frank Muller-Karger, a biological oceanography professor at the University of Maryland, told Bloomberg that the red tide will lack a nutrient supply if it spreads onto land. Serge Thomas, a professor of environmental studies at Florida Gulf Coast University, told USA Today that Hurricane Michael could slow algae growth if it lowers temperatures in Florida. USA Today also reported that storm winds could end up breaking up the red tide and pulling it away from beaches.","Hurricane Michael, the strongest storm to hit the US since 1969, made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday afternoon.

"USA Today, The Editorial Board, USA Today","Deteriorated U.S. and Puerto Rico flags near Yabucoa on May 16, 2018. (Photo: Carlos Giusti, AP) The most iconic image from Donald Trump's helmsmanship of last year's Puerto Rico crisis is the clip of the president in a windbreaker tossing paper towels, free-throw style, to survivors of Hurricane Maria. Other responses were equally disquieting: Trump's assurances that federal emergency managers were doing an ""incredible job."" His Twitter war with the despairing mayor of storm-ravaged San Juan. And his odd remark that the island's desolation wasn't a "" real catastrophe "" like Hurricane Katrina, which slammed the Gulf Coast in 2005, because there were only 16 deaths in Puerto Rico. The official tally would eventually rise to 64. But it wasn't until this week, with the release of a Harvard mortality analysis, that Americans could fully gauge how their fellow citizens on Puerto Rico fell victim to the deadliest natural disaster on U.S. soil in a century — an estimated 4,645 deaths, well over twice the number killed by Katrina. FEMA: Our role is to support local governments The vast majority died not when Maria came ashore but in the storm's aftermath, when a fumbled response by the White House and the territory's government and utilities allowed 3 million islanders to suffer weeks and months without electricity, running water or cellphone coverage. Interruptions or delays in health care killed a third of the victims. So much went wrong: ► There was insufficient sense of urgency. After an initial emergency declaration when the storm hit Sept. 20, Trump jetted off to his golf club in New Jersey, and four days passed to little effect. It took more than a week before the president waived restrictions barring foreign-flagged vessels from delivering aid and sent 4,400 troops and 40 helicopters to assist victims. By contrast, after an earthquake devastated Haiti (a Caribbean nation that isn't part of the U.S.) in 2010, President Obama had 8,000 troops en route in two days and 22,000 in two weeks, along with 300 military helicopters airlifting millions of pounds of food and water. ► Contracts were bungled. The federal disaster plan for Puerto Rico called for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist local authorities in relief efforts. But the island and its utilities were quickly overwhelmed, and FEMA was slow to realize this. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority disastrously hired a tiny, inexperienced Montana firm to restore power. FEMA, meanwhile, tapped an Atlanta business with a poor federal contract history to deliver food. The company only managed to provide hurricane victims with 50,000 of 18.5 million promised meals. ► Power restoration floundered. Not only did FEMA inexplicably fail to push the island to seek direct assistance from mainland utilities, the most common move by stricken communities for quickly restoring power, but the federal agency also gave the Army Corps of Engineers the long-term task of rebuilding Puerto Rico's power grid — a job for which the corps was unprepared and had never before undertaken. It took months to restore power to most of the island. Presidents are judged by how they handle natural disasters. George W. Bush was rightly criticized for his administration's initially clumsy response to Katrina. And while the Trump administration responded well when Hurricane Irma lashed Texas and Florida last September, it should — and must — bear considerable blame for the terrible loss of life in Puerto Rico.

azfamily.com News Staff,"Hurricane Rosa is churning off the Baja peninsula and it has the potential to produce heavy rain in Arizona. Tropical systems occasionally impact the Valley. A few have been known to cause major flooding. Back in September of 2014, remnants of Hurricane Norbert pushed into Arizona and inundated Phoenix with record rainfall for a single day of more than five inches. Floodwaters threatened at least a hundred homes in Mesa, including Andrea Garcias property. ""This neighborhood looked like something straight out of Hurricane Katrina,"" said Garcia. ""Where were standing now, we were standing in water up to our chest. Down the street was worse, the cars were covered to the top where the water had breached, and people were just trying to get out of their homes, not knowing what to do."" Retention basins and channels along the US 60 exceeded capacity and allowed water to flow into neighborhoods. ""Back then, we really didnt think. We got sand bags after that. Now, we keep sand bags in our little shed here. We keep one or two of the sand bags. I would suggest always know where the city has sand bags, getting them when its available,"" said Garcia. Four years later, Garcias home has gutters, a new drainage system for her yard and a bucket of basic supplies she can easily access. ""Bad things can happen and folks need to be prepared for that,"" said Stephen Waters, Flood Control District of Maricopa County. Waters suggests those living along culverts to be proactive. ""You might call a city and say please come out and clean this because when its plugged, my house is in danger,"" said Waters. He also warns to avoid driving, if heavy rain falls in a short amount of time. ""ADOT is working on a project to update their pumps all over the city. Theyre not there yet, so we could see rainfalls that overtax the ability of the pumps to pump out the interstates,"" said Waters.",AZFamily Valley residents in flood zones urged to be on alert as Hurricane Rosa churns off of Baja AZFamily Hurricane Rosa is churning off the Baja peninsula and it has the potential to produce heavy rain in Arizona.

ABC News,"President Donald Trump and the first lady head to FEMA headquarters Wednesday for a briefing on the forecast for the 2018 hurricane season, as congressional Democrats decry the administration's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Interested in Hurricanes? Add Hurricanes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricanes news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The visit comes days after a new reports suggested that the actual death toll in Puerto Rico from Maria may be more than 70 times the official estimate, with a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine documenting 4,645 ""excess deaths"" between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, compared to the government's official death toll of 64. Trump has previously given his administration a perfect ""10 out of 10"" score when asked to rate his administration's response to the hurricane devastation and also sought to positively contrast his administration's response to Hurricane Maria to Hurricane Katrina, which he called a ""real catastrophe."" ""Every death is a horror, but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous, hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering, no one has ever seen anything like this,"" Trump said October 3 during a visit to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the storm. The president said at the time that first responders and the government should be ""very proud"" of what he cast as a relatively low death toll, especially in contrast to 1,833 people who died in the Hurricane Katrina aftermath, according to FEMA. ""16 people, versus in the thousands, you can be very proud,"" Trump said. ""16 versus literally thousands of people, you can be very proud."" That comment still enrages some Democrats, including Rep. Nydia Velazquez, who complains that the fatality numbers ""drive the narrative about what happened in Puerto Rico and how our government responded and how we should rebuild going forward."" ""Yes Mr. President, this is a real catastrophe,"" Velazquez, D-N.Y., told reporters at the Capitol Wednesday, directing her comments toward President Trump. ""So, Mr. President, when you are visiting FEMA today to mark the beginning of hurricane season, let's be clear: this is not the time for self-congratulations or victory laps. Sadly, we may never know the true number of deaths, however going forward we need transparency and a full accounting of the facts."" Last December, Velazquez asked for an audit of the death count. Now she's requesting a congressionally-authorized, independent, non-partisan investigation in the mold of the 9/11 commission to evaluate disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. ""I expect that once all of the information is brought to light, we will find our government's inadequate response to Maria constitutes a stain on the moral conscience of our nation,"" she said. ""It's obvious that the numbers we got were wrong,"" Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., added. ""I've seen a lot of disasters in this country, and I've seen a quick response. The response to Puerto Rico was slow."" Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, said that the Government Accountability Office has accepted his request to examine the death toll. “What we saw in Puerto Rico was absolutely a failure to perform,” Thompson, D-Miss., said. “This is totally unacceptable. The lights are on in Texas. The lights are on in Florida but somehow they're not on in Puerto Rico. And we need to find out why.” Asked if the president still stands by that perfect-score rating on Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders didn’t directly answer but applauded the federal government’s response. “The federal response, once again, was at a historic proportion,” Sanders said. “We're continuing to work with the people of Puerto Rico and do the best we can to provide federal assistance, particularly working with the governor there in Puerto Rico. And we'll continue to do so.” ABC News’ Joshua Hoyos contributed to this report.","President Donald Trump and the first lady head to FEMA headquarters Wednesday for a briefing on the forecast for the 2018 hurricane season, as congressional Democrats decry the administration's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.

https://www.facebook.com/zezimak,"PANAMA CITY, Fla. Business used to be good at Peggy Sue Singletons tiny, white cinder-block barber shop, where she and a co-worker snipped and buzzed more than 200 heads of hair each week in this seaside city adjacent to a military base. The cinder blocks now are strewn across the parking lot as if bludgeoned by a wrecking ball, her parlor a haphazard heap of construction innards: splintered wood, smashed windows, wire. As she sifted through the remains, Singleton salvaged two $500 hair vacuums, a stash of suds from her free beer Fridays, and the sign that once displayed her prices: Haircuts $11; flat tops $13. This is the happy place! the battered white lettering says. Hurricane Michael was the wrecker of this happy place. It hit here more than a week ago, with 155-mph winds that ripped and twisted a wide path through coastal and inland communities, flattening buildings, tearing up roads and knocking out power to entire counties. Michael didnt just break objects, it upended everything. Life in Panama City is still completely disrupted, with many lacking power, running water, reliable cell service and access to the Internet. This city of 36,000 has long been a gateway to the Gulf, a white-beach playground providing a touch of paradise along the Florida Panhandle. But residents are now carving out new, unfamiliar existences amid the destruction, driven by the dictates of survival and loss of the staples of modern life. Some like Singleton, who said she has cut a deal with the commander of Tyndall Air Force Base to trim hair there, under escort are devising fresh ways of doing former jobs. Others are seeking entirely new employment, often facing competition from outsiders looking to take advantage of the repair work that follows a disaster. And everyone is adapting to a society where credit cards and cellphones often dont work. The recovery has transformed their surroundings into a giant construction site, where the whine of sirens joins the constant buzz of chain saws and the clanks of heavy equipment. Traffic crawls. There is now no need to budget for basic necessities such as food and bottled water, which are free at distribution centers, though ice is hard to find. Registering with insurance adjusters or for federal aid without a working phone requires waiting in line. Information about open pharmacies or stores selling generators and batteries is passed on by word of mouth. The few stores that are open often make cash-only sales, but legal tender is hard to find, too: Most banks remain closed, and ATMs arent working. One bank, BB&amp;T, put a mobile satellite unit in a parking lot to help infuse cash into the community. When theres not power, theres not connectivity, and obviously they dont work, Brian Davis, a BB&amp;T spokesman, said of ATMs. Davis is from Panama City and drove from North Carolina the day after the storm to evacuate his mother and her husband. Its bad. I cried, Davis said. I used to be in news. Ive seen hurricanes, Ive seen tornadoes.... Ive never seen anything like this. [ Houses intact after Hurricane Michael were often saved by low-cost reinforcements ] A week without infrastructure is testing even those who prepared for the storm and its aftermath. Jack Humphreys and his son-in-law, both retired from the military, filled their vehicles with gas, knowing it would give them enough to siphon for their generator and other unforeseen emergencies. They withdrew $500 in cash, expecting it might be difficult to navigate a post-hurricane economy. But the family quickly exhausted the money: We went through it like candy, Humphreys said, as he set out to buy bananas. Everything is cash. You cant get to a bank. In addition to being unable to access money, residents also are competing to make more of it with disaster-savvy out-of-towners from North Carolina, Texas and beyond. Some after-storm entrepreneurs are offering specialized skills as roofers, tree surgeons and mold-abatement experts, and others just import their muscle to help clear debris and rebuild. A waitress at a seafood restaurant served up beer and wine to customers in a city thats been dry for several days. She had lost one part-time job, and noted that all the new work seemed to be for burly young men. The tables at Dat Cajun Place, owned by a couple who fled here from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, were largely occupied by men among them visiting contractors and locals, who were trying to get their houses fixed while their wives and children stayed with family or friends. After relying on bottled water and free baby wipes to wash off with at the end of days of hard labor, some residents spoke wistfully of warm showers, flushing toilets and working laundromats. By Friday, when the roiled sea returned to azure blue, some families took to the beach for sanctuary from the endless cleaning and repairs and as schools remained closed. At People Ready, a temporary employment agency, Keith Crawford, a barber from Biloxi, Miss., who lived through Katrina, said he had just driven in from Wilmington, N.C., where Hurricane Florence opened work opportunities a month ago. Theres work everywhere, Crawford said. And the cost of the gas was worth it when he could earn $10.50 an hour traveling the country doing disaster cleanup. Christine Hudson, 50, said she didnt have trouble finding jobs before the storm but isnt sure about the future, with so many tourism and service businesses damaged or destroyed. Thats why I came here. Ive never signed up for a day labor place before, but it will keep us busy for a while, Hudson said. She was relieved to learn that the firm has immediate jobs that pay between $10 and $13 an hour. It helps keep your mind off of... all this, she said, gesturing to the shattered landscape. Hudsons truck was ruined and the windows of her apartment blown out, but she has nowhere else to go. Panama City is best known for its beaches and tourist economy, but the damage to large employers could affect the area for years. The storm wrecked much of Tyndall, which evacuated its 3,600 active-duty and 2,000 civilian employees, plus thousands of dependents and military retirees. There are no estimates yet of total rebuilding costs. The WestRock Company paper mill employed about 600 people, but it said in a statement that some production will be limited to 50 percent of capacity for the next six months. [ Its all gone: Tiny Florida beach town nearly swept away by Hurricane Michael ] There also was widespread damage at Eastern Shipbuilding Group, which employed about 800 people and had plans to expand next year after winning a large Coast Guard contract. Vice President Steve Berthold said it is too soon to estimate when production will resume, but about 40 percent of the workforce is doing cleanup and repairs. More than 1,000 people work at or around the Port of Panama City, said executive director Wayne Stubbs. The main port operations suffered but are generally repairable and should be able to service most customers right away. But a new warehouse at its east terminal and a distribution warehouse north of town suffered major damage. You never dream that all three facilities could get hit so hard at once, Stubbs said. At RV Connections, employees drove a convoy of vehicles north before the storm and brought them back when the weather settled. Owner Jack Stewart usually sells about 45 RVs each month. Now, with people homeless, he is selling four or five modest RVs a day that can accommodate several people. It is not a success he takes pleasure in. This is not the way we like to sell our RVs, Stewart said. Veronica LaMont works at an adult novelty store in neighboring Panama City Beach, a tourist mecca where business is usually pretty good. Since the storm, regulars have dropped by to check in with her but made few purchases. Its not clear when tourists who drive so much of the regional economy will be back. And the first responders occupying the vacation condos havent made up for the drop in sales. They are just too busy for that, LaMont said. They dont have time. Local residents are exhausted, too, figuring out how to right themselves. Singleton, sifting like an archaeologist through the remains of her barber shop, suddenly plunged for a dusty object, settled its familiar grip back into her hand and raised it above her head in triumph. Oh my God, those are my clippers! she exclaimed.

MITCH SMITH and JULIE BOSMAN,"[Read more about how the officers were found not guilty of conspiring to protect Mr. Van Dyke.]
At Mr. Van Dykes trial, prosecutors played the dash camera video for jurors over and over. They showed gruesome autopsy photographs. They emphasized that Mr. Van Dyke was the only officer to fire his gun.
It wasnt the knife in Laquans hand that made the defendant kill him that night, a prosecutor, Jody Gleason, said during closing arguments. It was his indifference to the value of Laquans life.
A longtime officer who had never been involved in a shooting before, Mr. Van Dyke testified in his own defense, growing emotional at times and insisting that he acted as he was trained. I just kept on looking at that knife and I shot at it, he told jurors, who were ultimately unswayed.
Mr. Van Dyke, the first Chicago police officer convicted of murder for an on-duty shooting in nearly 50 years, has spent recent months at the Rock Island County Jail in western Illinois. In post-trial court appearances, Mr. Van Dyke, who was clean-shaven and well-dressed during his trial, had a scruffy beard and wore a yellow jumpsuit. He is widely expected to appeal his conviction.
Before sentencing, prosecutors, defense lawyers and courthouse observers offered wildly divergent theories on the punishment he might face. In the rare instances when other American police officers have been convicted in deadly shootings, sentences have varied greatly. Peter Liang, a former New York City officer found guilty of manslaughter, was sentenced to probation and community service in 2016. Roy Oliver, a former Texas officer, received a 15-year prison term last year for murder. David Warren, a former New Orleans officer convicted in the killing of an unarmed civilian after Hurricane Katrina, received a term of 25 years and 9 months.
[Was the Laquan McDonald case a turning point or an aberration?]
In Mr. Van Dykes case, his lawyers suggested probation, which Illinois law allows for second-degree murder, and emphasized that he had no criminal history. They submitted dozens of letters from supporters urging Judge Gaughan to be lenient, including a plea from one of Mr. Van Dykes two daughters, who said she fell into a depression after the verdict.
Its time for him to hug and kiss his wife and protect his family, the daughter, who is in high school, wrote to Judge Gaughan. Bring my dad home.
But the aggravated battery charges carry a mandatory six-year prison term, leading some to theorize that the minimum sentence might be 96 years in prison if that was applied for all 16 counts. In a pre-sentencing memo, prosecutors suggested a middle road, in which Mr. Van Dyke would serve at least 18 years but not what would in effect be a life sentence.",Mr. Van Dyke was the first Chicago police officer in decades convicted of murder for an on-duty shooting.

Aria Bendix,"Brad Pitt's nonprofit foundation, Make It Right, started with the goal of helping New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. As the city's Lower Ninth Ward recovered from the deadly Category 5 storm in 2005, the foundation sought to satisfy its most pressing need: housing. 
 ""We went into it incredibly naive,"" Pitt told the New Orleans Times-Picayune in 2015. ""Just thinking we can build homes — how hard is that?"" 
 The project's lofty goals, like equipping the homes with sustainable building materials and energy-saving appliances, were difficult to pull off. 
 Twelve years after the start of Make It Right, residents have reported that units are rotting, collapsing, and caving in. One resident told NBC News that mold and improper ventilation in her home caused her family to come down with a slew of health issues, including respiratory infections, tremors, and memory problems.

 In September, attorney Ron Austin filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of two residents, claiming that Pitt and the foundation failed to alert homeowners of issues with the design and materials. That same month, Make It Right filed a lawsuit of its own against the project's executive architect, John Williams, and his firm. 
 The saga doesn't stop there.

The homeowners' lawsuit is now headed to federal court, with the defendants arguing that repairs could cost them $20 million. About a month after this news was announced, Pitt's lawyers petitioned to have him removed from the suit. 
 Although Pitt has reportedly left the board of Make It Right, a spokesperson for the actor said he was still coordinating with the foundation to repair homes as of September. 
 In addition to filing a lawsuit, Make It Right has undertaken its own efforts to distance itself from the damage. 
 NBC News reported that Make It Right asked some residents to sign nondisclosure agreements in exchange for repairs or settlements. The foundation has also stopped updating its website and posting to its social media accounts. 
 The foundation also hasn't filed a tax form or built a home in years, according to NBC. 
Homes in the 'Make it Right' complex showed promise when they were first constructed.

Make It Right did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment. 
 Residents have told multiple news outlets that the foundation won't return their calls. 
 Austin's lawsuit claims that Make It Right inspected homes in 2016, 2017, and 2018, but did not disclose findings to homeowners. The suit also alleges that the foundation held off on making repairs until residents signed NDAs. 
 ""Make It Right was very good at pacifying people and putting them off, and pacifying people and putting them off,"" Austin told Architectural Digest. ""They might come back and fix one thing, but not everything."" 
 In over a decade of existence, Make It Right has built more than 100 homes in New Orleans. Many of the homes are now abandoned, and at least one has been demolished due to rotting and rain damage. Other residents remain trapped in 30-year mortgages that they cannot afford to break.","Brad Pitt's ambitious housing project tried to rebuild a New Orleans neighborhood after Hurricane Katrina, but residents are now complaining that their homes are rotting, collapsing, and caving in.

S.V. Date,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has renewed his attacks on hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico with new and old falsehoods — in stark contrast to his tone and attitude toward disaster-stricken communities in states that voted for him.
Trump Tuesday wrote, falsely: “Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, &amp; all their local politicians do is complain &amp; ask for more money,” and then suggested, also falsely, that Puerto Rico is not part of the United States. “The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, &amp; only take from USA.”
“No part of his statement is even factual,” said Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democratic member of the Florida legislature whose Central Florida district includes thousands of Puerto Rican migrants, including some who moved after Category 4 Maria struck the island in 2017. “His response to Puerto Rico reeks of racism. He treats Puerto Ricans the same way he treats Spanish-speaking immigrants. Like dirt. Like garbage.”
The White House did not respond to HuffPost requests for comment about Trump’s false statements, the tone of which also offers a striking contrast to his statements following previous storms.
“TEXAS: We are with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER, to restore, recover, and REBUILD!” Trump wrote on Sept. 2, 2017, after Hurricane Harvey hit.
And last month, after tornadoes killed 23 in Alabama, Trump wrote: “FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes. @GovernorKayIvey, one of the best in our Country, has been so informed. She is working closely with FEMA (and me!).”
“What makes Puerto Rico different? It’s just really sad,” Smith said. “It’s why he’s so unpopular on the island.”
The Caribbean territory, acquired by the United States more than a century ago following the Spanish-American war, suffered the most devastating damage from a hurricane since Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005. Nearly 3,000 residents died in the storm and in the aftermath — a number Trump claimed was fabricated by his political opponents to make him look bad.
His $91 billion figure appears to be an estimate of how much the reconstruction from the storm will wind up costing over the coming decades. In comparison, Katrina wound up costing $120 billion.
In fact, Puerto Rico has been approved to spend only $300 million in rebuilding assistance so far, the territory’s governor responded on Twitter. “We are Americans, we are your citizens,” Ricardo Rosello wrote. “Puerto Ricans ARE American farmers! American teachers! American citizens! American everything!”
Trump’s latest round of attacks on Puerto Rico started just before midnight Monday after a disaster relief spending bill failed in the Senate because Republicans voted with Trump not to appropriate additional money for Puerto Rico and Democrats would not support a bill that did not include it.
“The politicians are incompetent or corrupt. Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas &amp; Florida combined, yet their government can’t do anything right, the place is a mess - nothing works,” Trump complained. “FEMA &amp; the Military worked emergency miracles, but politicians like the crazed and incompetent Mayor of San Juan have done such a poor job of bringing the Island back to health. 91 Billion Dollars to Puerto Rico, and now the Dems want to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful!”
On Tuesday, the president further claimed that he personally was “the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico” but that he “cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments and so little appreciation.”
It is unclear on what basis Trump was making the first assertion, or whether more appreciation from Puerto Rican leaders would lead to faster and better treatment from FEMA.","Trump lashes out against Americans devastated by Hurricane Maria, just a month after promising Alabama tornado victims that he had ordered “A Plus” treatment for them.",2019-04-02T20:41:13Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Huffpost.com'}",Trump Has Only Love For Disaster Victims — Unless They Are Puerto Ricans,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-puerto-rico-tirade_n_5ca3be78e4b0e6ed9467125d,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ca3bf3c240000a1074f5abb.jpeg?cache=7dOvLJ2wzT&ops=1200_630,,Huffpost.com,Hurricane Katrina,1
Aria Bendix,"Many Americans dream of a life on the coast, with the sun grazing their rooftops and waves lapping at the shore below. Not everyone considers the risk of purchasing a coastal property, which could easily be destroyed in the event of a hurricane. When Hurricane Michael touched down in Mexico Beach, Florida, in mid-October, only one oceanfront home was left fully intact: a two-story structure known as Sand Palace that had been built a year prior. The remaining homes were either wiped out or stripped down to their shoddy foundations. Much of this damage could have been prevented if the homes had adhered to Florida's updated building codes, which require safe construction elements like buttressed roofs and shatterproof windows. But the fact that these codes were implemented in 2007 left older homes powerless in the face of the storm. To find out what property owners can do to prepare for a future hurricane, we spoke with Geoff Chick, an architect building hurricane-resistant homes in the Gulf of Mexico, an area recently ravaged by the Category 4 Hurricane Michael. Building for a hurricane To protect themselves from damage, homeowners have one of two options: build a new structure or retrofit an old one. The price of both undertakings has left many low-income residents vulnerable to disaster. The architect behind Sand Palace, Charles Gaskin, told The New York Times that hurricane-resistant features tend to double the cost of construction per square foot. Read more: Floating homes that can withstand Category 4 hurricanes will soon become a reality ""I don't think it's feasible for everybody in the country to design their houses to be hurricane-proof,"" said Chick. ""There are so many people who don't have the financial resources."" For Chick, building a hurricane-resistant property comes down to a handful of foundational features. Still, he said, there are a few accessories that can protect an older home from damage. Here's his recommended list. Hurricane shutters Hurricane shutters help protect windows from debris that have been stirred up by strong winds. The consequence of a broken window can be grave: In the event of a storm, it causes air pressure to rise and the house to blow apart from the inside. For those worried about the labor or cost, there's good news: Some insurance companies in states like Maryland, Florida, Louisiana, and Rhode Island offer discounted rates for homeowners with hurricane shutters. While more expensive homes have shutters made of metal or polycarbonate plastic, lower-income properties often resort to plywood. Chick's homes are often built on concrete pilings. Geoff Chick Impact windows Impact windows are perhaps the most important feature for homes located near the coast, but not directly along the water, said Chick. Instead of being exposed to storm surge, these homes are vulnerable to a hurricane's heavy winds. Fifteen years ago, Chick said, impact windows weren't required by the building code in Florida. It wasn't until an onslaught of storms — including Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina — that insurance companies began to push for stricter regulations to protect themselves from loss. Now it's common for new homes in the Gulf to be made of laminated glass with a sheet of Kevlar inside. According to Chick, these windows are designed to withstand the impact of a 2x4 stud heading toward them at 150 miles per hour. But this protection comes at a price. Chick said that impact windows are often double the cost of a normal window package: around $40,000 compared to the standard $18,000. Concrete pilings One of the most basic elements of hurricane-proofing is to build a home on concrete pilings, which elevate it above the storm surge. The pilings also help support the structure and keep it from collapsing amid heavy winds. ""Over the years, we've had houses that have survived storms because they were on pilings,"" said Chick. ""When the houses on either side of them collapsed into the Gulf, ours were still there."" Panama City's newer waterfront homes cost around $3 million to build, Chick said. Geoff Chick Hurricane straps Hurricane straps — pieces of the galvanized steel that secure the walls of a home to its rafters — can be installed during a retrofit, but it's an expensive and invasive process. Adding straps after a home has already been built requires cutting back the sheetrock and exposing the beams. Chick said it's far easier to install the straps during new construction, before the sheetrock has been laid down. But there's still the cost of labor to consider. In either case, hurricane straps help make sure that the roof doesn't fly off during a storm. Impact-rated garage doors ""A lot of the houses [during Hurricane Michael] had their entire roof system pulled off and blown down the street, and the point of failure was actually the garage door,"" said Chick. Just like a broken window, a broken garage door can allow wind to enter and put pressure on the roof. By shuttering a garage or installing an impact-rated garage door, residents can save their home from damage. Chick said some of his previous projects have had impact-related garage doors that cost around $10,000. Shutters are a much cheaper option, but offer less protection. The price of safety Whether they're retrofitting an old home or building a new one, coastal homeowners pay a hefty premium for safety. ""There are a tremendous amount of hoops that you have to jump through when you build a Gulf-front house,"" said Chick. In the wake of Hurricane Michael, he said, newer multi-million-dollar structures in Panama City remained undamaged, while the older homes were cleared out. ""There were neighborhoods where everything was completely destroyed, and the brand-new office buildings didn't have a scratch on them,"" he said. As the region attempts to rebuild, these expensive properties are likely to multiply. ""People with the means to build a nice house are doing what it takes to protect themselves and their assets,"" Chick said. ""You can be sure that everything that goes back in Mexico Beach is going to be built to the same level of construction as that one house that survived.""","Florida architect Geoff Chick ha s built numerous hurricane-resistant homes in the Gulf of Mexico, which was recently ravaged by the Category 4 Hurricane Michael.

Ashley Collman,"Technology is changing the way that emergency responders conduct search-and-rescue operations after hurricanes. When Hurricane Michael ravaged the Florida Panhandle, Amber Gee turned to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maps to see the damage inflicted on her grandmother's property in Youngstown, Florida. What she found was remarkable: a call for ""HELP"" written on the lawn in downed tree branches. Gee alerted rescuers, who found her uncle, aunt, and a family friend hunkering down at the property last Sunday, and brought them to safety. Mike Aslaksen heads the remote sensing division of the NOAA's National Geodetic Survey. Courtesy of Mike Aslaksen It was a feel-good story for Mike Aslaksen, who leads the remote sensing division of the NOAA's National Geodetic Survey. ""I'm happy that there was a happy ending to this,"" he told Business Insider on Tuesday. ""It again really shows some of the multi-use of this data."" The images Gee found came from NOAA researchers taking photos from survey planes that flew over the damaged areas once the hurricane had passed through. The images were then compiled into an interactive map that anyone can search and explore. Aslaksen remembers a similar story coming out of Hurricane Katrina, and is hopeful that the press surrounding Gee's story will lead to others using the tool in future natural disasters. A bird's eye view This technology is hardly new. Aslasksen says NOAA has been taking aerial photos after natural disasters since the 1930s. Typically, the agency sends a single surveying plane up after hurricanes to see what kind of damage the storm has done to the shorelines that might impact nautical travel. FEMA also gives Aslaksen's team special missions to collect images of the destruction inland. Aslaksen shared this image showing the routes the survey plane took after Hurricane Michael. The lines covered the shoreline and a large area north of Panama City, with one line stretching up into Georgia: This maps shows the routes that the NOAA plane took after Hurricane Michael to take pictures of the destruction. NOAA The images taken from the plane are especially helpful at the beginning of the recovery effort, when search-and-rescue teams are reliant on these pictures to see which routes they can take to reach hard-hit areas or whether they need to be helicoptered in. Aslasken said he heard Florida officials used the Hurricane Michael images to determine the best places for helicopters to land in the devastated town of Mexico Beach in order to deliver much-needed food and water. Read more: 25 photos show Hurricane Michael's destruction from the sky A new era of disaster imagery And it's not only hurricanes they're surveying from the sky. The team, which usually includes two pilots and a sensor operator, have also been sent to survey the damage after tornadoes, major floods, earthquakes, nor'easters, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and even man-made disasters like the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. It was September 11th that proved a turning point for the division. Back then, they used film to take their pictures, which meant that it could take up to a week to process the data into a digital format. ""When we interacted with the emergency response community, they really said we need it in 24 hours or we can't use it all,"" Aslaksen said. So his team focused their energies on digitizing their whole process to meet that 24-hour goal. A NOAA aerial picture shows some of the damage done after the Great Alaskan Earthquake of 1964. NOAA They met that goal and then some. In regards to Michael, the team flew their first mission Thursday morning and had their first sets of maps out by 8:30 p.m., just four hours after landing. ""Comparatively, if we had to do that from the high-end work stations that we used to carry, that could be eight to 12 hours,"" he said. Aslaksen credits the quick turnaround to their camera, which does a lot of the processing while they are still in the air, and the cloud system that they upload their photos to, which can upload between 1,500 to 3,000 images in just a matter of hours. ""Our biggest challenge in a lot of cases is just having a good internet connection to upload the data,"" he said. Record-breaking events A view of some of the devastation after Hurricane Irma on the island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. NOAA After years of responding to natural disasters, Aslaksen said four stuck out in particular: Hurricane Katrina, the Tuscaloosa-Birmingham tornado, the US Virgin Islands after Hurricane Irma, and Michael. Aslaksen said it left him awestruck to see before images of the Virgin Islands, totally green, turned to brown after Irma completely stripped the vegetation. ""This really shows you how the impact of these storms can be. When you're told to leave, you need to leave,"" he said. Aslaksen said the records show the events they've surveyed in the last year or two have been more severe. ""We're flying a lot more than we used to,"" he said.","One of the feel-good stories to come out of Hurricane Michael was the woman who spotted her relatives' call for help thanks to interactive maps from NOAA.

"Molly Olmstead, Molly Olmstead","A man walks through floodwaters in Juana Matos, Puerto Rico, on September 21, 2017. A new Harvard study estimates that at least 4,600 people in Puerto Rico have died from causes related to Hurricane Maria, a far larger number than the official government death toll of 64. According to the new study, which was conducted by a group of independent researchers from Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, these deaths could often be attributed to delayed and limited healthcare in the aftermath of the storm, which shuttered several hospitals, crippled the power grid, knocked out cell service, and made many roads impassable. The study, released Tuesday, is based on researchers’ visits to more than 3,000 homes on the island. The residents reported that 38 people in those homes had died between the day of the storm and the end of the year, and that mortality rate allowed researchers to extrapolate a larger death toll from the overall population. They then could figure out how much higher that number was from the number of deaths during those three months the year before, giving them the number of “excess” deaths. The research leaves room for a more precise, exhaustive study of the death toll. But the study also supports charges leveled against the territory’s government that the official toll had wildly undercounted the number of dead. Disaster-related deaths can be tricky to determine, according to the Washington Post, and they have to be confirmed by the government’s Forensic Sciences Institute. Individual disaster-related deaths can also be difficult to label when they are indirect, as when they are a matter of poor care for an otherwise natural cause or preexisting condition. According to the New York Times, the study criticized the territory’s lack of transparency in sharing information about the death toll. As a result, they argued, the government had made it harder to plan for future disasters. Donald Trump also came under fire shortly after the storm, when he boasted of the hurricane’s low number of reported deaths, which, he said, meant it was not “a real catastrophe like Katrina.” According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, roughly 1,800 deaths can be attributed to Hurricane Katrina. News organizations soon began to disagree with the official count, and the resulting pressure caused Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello to recruit George Washington University researchers to review and recount deaths in the wake of the hurricane, according to the Times. Rossello promised that each death following the hurricane would be inspected, and the researchers plan to release a report in the next few weeks. It’s been eight months since the hurricane hit Puerto Rico, and the island still suffers from a damaged power grid, a short supply of clean water, and a dearth of other essential services. The stress from and effort to rebuild and recover after the storm also continues to put a strain on those suffering from medical conditions.","A new Harvard study estimates that at least 4,600 people in Puerto Rico have died from causes related to Hurricane Maria, a far larger number than the official government death toll of 64.",2018-05-29T15:33:45Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}","New Study Finds Hurricane Maria’s Death Toll in Puerto Rico Likely More than 4,600",https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/05/harvard-study-finds-high-hurricane-maria-death-toll.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/81979ab9-e562-4272-bae6-4917f39a1af7.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=4920x3280&offset=8x0,,Slate.com,Hurricane Katrina,1
We Are The Mighty,"Seventy-five years ago, on July 17, 1943, one Army Air Corps pilot dared another to fly his plane into the eye of a hurricane, and a new method of predicting storms and getting adrenaline highs was born. Army Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Joseph P. Duckworth flew an T-6 trainer aircraft into the eye of a hurricane headed to the Texas coast on a dare just to prove it could be done. After the flight, he wrote, ""The only embarrassing episode would have been engine failure, which, with the strong ground winds, would probably have prevented a landing, and certainly would have made descent via parachute highly inconvenient."" But the dare proved fruitful, and Duckworth went back up with a weather officer. Studying the hurricane allowed the meteorologists to not only better predict that storm, but to start building a better understanding of how hurricanes form and move. This preceded a massive expansion of the Army's weather reconnaissance squadrons, with new squadrons being stood up throughout the late 1940s and the '50s with names like ""Hurricane Hunters"" and ""Typhoon Chasers."" The introduction of satellites eventually made many of the formations unnecessary, leading to them being inactivated or re-missioned, but one unit remains in service. The 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, based in Mississippi, is an Air Force Reserve Unit still tasked with flying into the hearts of storms. But most of the missions into storms are now conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Aircraft Operations Center. In fact, the widely covered video of hurricane hunters flying into Hurricane Florence was shot by an NOAA crew working to collect data on the storm before it hits the US east coast. And the US has been transitioning to using drones for hurricane flights where possible, saving pilots, even if it does make the news releases less exciting.","US Navy National Museum of Naval Aviation/Wikimedia Commons The Army Air Corps' ""Hurricane Hunters"" that just flew through Hurricane Florence began when one pilot dared another to fly his plane into the eye of a hurricane.

Zahra Hirji,"It’s official: 2017 set a new record for big, costly disasters in the United States. The nation was struck by 16 hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural disasters last year, each with losses exceeding $1 billion. Combined, these weather and climate disasters cost about $306 billion, according to new data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Hurricanes were the biggest source of damages by far. This past hurricane season resulted in a record-high $265 billion in losses, and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria all ranked in the top five most expensive US tropical cyclones based on preliminary estimates. Although Katrina remained the most expensive hurricane ($161.3 billion), Harvey ranked second ($125 billion), Maria third ($90 billion), Sandy fourth ($70.2 billion), and Irma fifth ($50 billion). The three major hurricanes last year killed about 250 people combined, NOAA estimates. Maria knocked out Puerto Rico’s entire electric grid, triggering the largest blackout in US history. Both Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands are still recovering from the direct strike by the Category 4 hurricane. While Florida continues to recover from Irma’s strong winds and coastal flooding, Texas is still responding to the flood-related damage from Harvey’s record rainfall that dumped up to 50 inches in some places. Previously, 2005 was the most expensive year for disasters, largely due to devastation brought by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, and Rita. A string of deadly fires in the West, including the largest fire in California’s recent history, generated about $18 billion in losses, the new report found. That’s three times higher than the past annual record, according to NOAA. These fires claimed the lives of at least 54 people and damaged or destroyed more than 15,000 homes and other buildings. Some of the other costly US disasters last year include: an outbreak of tornadoes in various southern states in January; California flooding in February; a freeze in the southeast that damaged fruit crops in March; and severe thunderstorms in the midwest in June. Besides being an expensive year for disasters, 2017 was also the third-warmest for the contiguous US since record-keeping began in 1895, NOAA scientists said. The hottest year was 2012, followed by 2016.",Last year marked the costliest US wildfire and hurricane seasons on record.

Rachel Becker,"The worst disaster in California’s history wasn’t an earthquake, or a fire, or a drought — it was a flood that killed thousands, wiped out mines and ranches, and submerged the state capital, Sacramento. For 43 days, starting in December 1861, California was inundated. Today, hardly anyone thinks about the floodwaters that turned California’s Central Valley into a vast lake — but it will happen again. “It’s not a question of if, but when,” writes seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones in her new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters H ave Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them). That’s why it’s key for us to know about the disasters in our history, so that we’re not doomed to repeat them on what will certainly be a much larger scale. After all, more than 100 times as many people now live in California as did during that deluge, Jones writes. “What’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities.” While natural hazards are inevitable, the destruction they wreak is not, Jones says in an interview with The Verge. “We can make choices about how we handle that — but we have to think ahead,” she says. Working at the US Geological Survey, Jones led a team of scientists who investigated the potential catastrophes in California’s future. One of them was a flood, and the team discovered that our existing flood control strategies would be no match for a deluge nearly the size of the one that started in 1861: The disaster would cause more devastation than an earthquake on the infamous San Andreas fault. After 33 years at the USGS, Jones retired and opened the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, which aims to boost community resilience using science. In her book, she lays out catastrophic disasters in human history from the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii to Hurricane Katrina to the Tohoku quake in Japan in 2011. She tells both the scientific story of how disasters unfolded, and the human story of the communities they struck. “We have to think ahead.” Her goal is to teach readers about disasters by drawing them in with narratives, and to address the ways human nature can make it harder to prepare for the future. Most of us assume a big disaster is going to be similar to smaller ones we’ve experienced, which can make us overconfident in our ability to deal with catastrophes — something experts call “normalization bias.” Our tendency to focus on more immediate threats can also come at the expense of preparing for more distant ones — which makes sense, Jones says: “If you worry about the 100-year flood and not about the wolf that’s about to eat your children, your DNA does not get passed down.” She draws on her experience as a scientist, and as a communicator who helped the public make sense of the destruction in the aftermath of earthquakes. The Verge spoke with Jones about natural hazards, risk assessment, and the disaster that haunts her. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. I grew up in California, and only learned about the 1861-1862 flood last year. How do you keep the memory of such a major disaster fresh, and make sure that people don’t forget that this could happen again? Photo by Helen Berger Dr. Lucy Jones It’s very difficult to do. In a natural world, if we hadn’t built all of our flood control systems, we would have smaller floods much more often. When you have the smaller ones, at least you know that flooding is a risk. But you do tend to believe that the risk is what you’ve already dealt with. So, paradoxically, the flood managers who were fully aware of the 1861 flood seemed more willing to say, ‘We’ve got it covered. That isn’t really going to happen again.” And, like with earthquakes, I find that the people were actually part of a response to Northridge, [ a quake that hit part of the Los Angeles area in 1994 ], are much more overconfident about their abilities to handle the really big one, because they feel like they dealt with the really big one. And that that wasn’t the really big one doesn’t get through. Hundreds of years ago, we didn’t have the information to be able to think ahead. Now we have more information, and yet we still struggle with the emotional aspect of it, because it doesn’t seem real to us. And that, right there, is the challenge of natural disasters. We know what they’re going to do, we know how to build to avoid the damage, but everything about human nature keeps us from looking forward [for] that really long-term planning. So it requires much more rational, logical thought, and reasoned discourse. So how do we now wrestle with the human inability to think ahead and also to remember the past? “Around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before.” Because of globalization and improved telecommunications, we now have a situation where a flood or a big disaster somewhere else in the world is something we can experience in real time. One of the most striking examples of that was the Tohoku earthquake in northern Japan [in 2011]. I’m sitting in my living room in California, and I can turn on the TV and watch in real time the tsunami wave. And we see the people fleeing from it, from the air. We don’t have enough to save them at this point, but we watch them in real time suffer through this. Now, around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before, I would say. Fifteen years ago, it was rare to find a person who knew what a tsunami was. But between the Indian Ocean event [in 2004], and Japan [in 2011], and the really direct, emotional experience with the power of telecommunications, we have a really different understanding and experience of it. And that is allowing us to overcome that normalization bias, and it’s part of the reason that we’ve been able to [make progress] here in Southern California [with] getting people to take the risk seriously and doing something about it. For us, it isn’t about tsunamis, it’s mostly about earthquakes. The book is divided by chapter into case studies of different disasters through history — which one kept you up at night? Which one haunted you? The 1927 Mississippi flood — the greatest flood disaster in American history. Mississippi is a huge river system that drains the majority of American states. A huge rainfall starting in the fall of 1926 through winter and spring led to failures of the levees protecting the land around the Mississippi river. And 27,000 square miles were flooded and over 1 million people were flooded out of their homes. Over 600,000 people were living in refugee camps. “What really haunted me... was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens.” But what really haunted me about it — and made it by far the most difficult chapter to research and write — was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens. What happened to African American victims of the flood was appalling, and just the inhumanity of how they were treated. The Kanto earthquake, which was only four years before that was also — in Japan — an equally horrible turning on neighbors. And it was recognizing that part of the human experience is the need to find a reason why it was the victim’s fault, to blame the victim: “Because if it was the victim’s fault, then I can protect myself by not making those same mistakes.” It’s a subconscious response to fear: “I don’t want that to be able to happen to me.” So you find reasons that it’s the victim’s fault. And at the worst level, you then punish the victim of the situation. So when you ask what haunted me, I’m an Earth scientist. So the physical part of it was all what I understood and expected going in. What haunted me, and inspired, was sometimes the horribleness of human response, and sometimes the real inspiration of human response. And you see both in those stories. The book talks about the disconnect between the language scientists use and the language the public use s to talk about disasters. Scientists have their wind speeds for hurricanes, magnitude for earthquake, probability for flood — then the public asks, “Was it The Big One?” How do we bridge that gap — and do we need to? “I just see people talking past each other so much.” The stuff I put in this book — none of it is really hard to understand. A high schooler could easily read the book and understand it, maybe even somebody younger. And yet we don’t teach it. And therefore, the public doesn’t have a context within which to be getting the information or having the discussion. So we need better education in science, which does not mean learning a bunch of facts — the other part is to understand how to think about science, the fundamentals of science as a process for learning what’s really true. We don’t teach that. But then we also need to help the scientists understand that people are looking for a mix: they want the science, but they also want the human side of it. And we need to help the scientists do a better job of being to answer the human questions. I just see people talking past each other so much. You write about how being a seismologist gives you an unusual perspective on time and that a forecast that a disaster will happen “‘sometime in the next millennium’ sounds not like an evasion, but like a threat.” How has this perspective shaped your own relationship with risk? Are you resigned to it, or have you bought every kind of disaster insurance there is? “The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but chances of it in my lifetime?” The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but the chances of it in my lifetime? Well, the San Andreas is probably going to have [an earthquake] in my lifetime, but the fault I live near probably isn’t. So yes, it’s a possibility, but I just have to keep it balanced because it’s a relatively low possibility compared to other things. People assume that where I live must be a place that’s really safe from earthquakes, but we moved to a community with really good schools sitting right on top of a significant fault. We were basically gambling that an earthquake wouldn’t happen before the kids got out of high school, and it worked. Climate change is going to make meteorological disasters more frequent and more devastating, right? What do we need to do to make sure that we’re prepared? It’s going to be very difficult. People do not sufficiently understand what we are doing to ourselves with this. We need to do everything we can to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere and reduce what’s already there if it’s at all possible. Because more heat in the atmosphere doesn’t just mean it’s warmer and ‘oh I guess I can handle that.’ That means more energy to drive storms, and they are going to be getting worse. “That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger.” So first off, we’ve got to admit it. We can’t talk about nuisance flooding, because high tide is bringing it into your house, without thinking about what that means when the hurricane comes through. One of the big issues in America is that we have a pretty strong tradition of individual land rights: nobody gets to tell you what to do with your own land. We are really struggling as a society to be able to make those big scale decisions. We need to be changing our attitudes about community, how much we share, to accept that we’re dependent on the decisions of others. We don’t like to do that as Americans either, we so prize our independence. So we philosophically oppose that, but that doesn’t change what’s going to happen. That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger. If there were one thing you wanted your reader to take home about this book, what is it? You have choices. That hazards are inevitable and the disaster is not. We as a society have choices, both what we do individually, but also a choice to work together. The thing that came out of it for me is that what’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities, and we can change that if we can work together as a community.","In the new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them),  seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones tells both the scientific story of disasters, and the human story of the communities they struck.",2018-05-26T13:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",The hardest part of preparing for disasters is overcoming human nature,https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/26/17321100/the-big-ones-natural-disasters-lucy-jones-earthquakes-hurricanes-volcanoes-floods,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoH9Pj5-jHrX7PK8KOR706Ssf7I=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10780201/mdoying_180504_2512_0002.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,Hurricane Katrina,1
Eric Berger,"Enlarge / Houston, on Monday, basically all across the city. reader comments 500 Saturday August 25 marks the one-year anniversary of the Texas landfall of Hurricane Harvey. Alongside Hurricane Katrina, it ranks as the costliest hurricane on record for the United States. Revisiting this story now, as another slow-moving hurricane pounds the Hawaiian islands with heavy rainfall and life threatening flooding, seems both appropriate and unfortunate at the same time. As such, we're resurfacing this first-person account from Ars' Houston-based space guru, Eric Berger. The piece originally ran on August 30, 2017 and appears unchanged below. HOUSTON—Lightning crashed all around as I dashed into the dark night. The parking lot outside my apartment building had become swollen with rains, a torrent about a foot deep rushing toward lower ground God knows where. Amazingly, the garage door rose when I punched the button on the opener. Inside I found what I expected to find—mayhem. In dismay, I scooped up a box of books that had been on the floor. As I did, one of the sodden bottom flaps gave way, and a heavy book splashed into the water: From Dawn to Decadence, a timeless account of the Western world's great works by Jacques Barzun. Almost immediately, a current from the rushing water beyond the garage door pulled the tome away, forever. Damn, I loved that book. An indescribably bad night had just gotten that little bit worse. This little scene played out on Sunday morning, around 4am, after sheets of rain from Hurricane Harvey had drenched southern Houston for the previous 12 hours. A few miles away, amidst the tempest, my wife sat on the front porch of her sister's new home. It had been built on pilings to keep it safe from flooding. But when 24 inches falls in less than 24 hours, as it did over Clear Creek south of Houston, bad things happen. Amanda and her sister watched as the flood waters rose, step by step, toward the porch and first story where they sat. A similar situation played itself out all across the fourth largest city in the country that night. Fearful, nervous, terrified people watched the water coming up. And the relentless rain, it never seemed to end. As bayous rose, emergency responders issued warnings on TV and social media: don't go into your attics unless there's an exit or you take an axe. And bring white towels with you, they said, so we can find you on rooftops. People catch a ride on a construction truck as they evacuate their homes after the area was inundated with flooding from Hurricane Harvey. This gallery highlights scenes from around a ravaged Houston. People take shelter at the George R. Brown Convention Center after flood waters from Hurricane Harvey inundated the city on August 29, 2017. An overflight of a southeast Houston neighborhood on Sunday. A closer view of damage on Sunday. A Coast Guard MH-65 Dolphin helicopter crew from Air Station Houston takes off to conduct urban search and rescue in Houston on Sunday. Coast Guard Jayhawk helicopter crews evacuate Houston residents in flooded areas on Monday. This is an elevated freeway in downtown Houston. Minute Maid Park, home of the Houston Astros, can be seen to the left. Soldiers with the Texas Army National Guard support relief efforts to residents of Cyprus Creek on Monday. Another flooded neighborhood (notice the Taco truck and flooded homes). Bottled water is among the most valuable commodities during a storm. Another scene from Houston. What a lot of neighborhoods look like right now. Creeks across the region are swollen. Nationally, Houston has a lousy reputation. It's too hot, too humid, and too, well, too sprawly. It is all of those things. And don't tell the Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau I said this, but it's not a great city to visit. There isn't much to do here that's touristy, especially during our sultry summers. But here's a little secret: Houston is a great place to live. It's the opposite of, ""It's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there."" Rather, Houston may not be a nice place to visit, but you would want to live there. I do. But not on that Saturday night. Nor the next day. Nor night. Nor, well, any time through Wednesday. As this article publishes, periodic heavy rains are still pulsing through parts of the upper Texas coast as Harvey finally pulls away. Already, the city has nearly set an annual record for rainfall, and the month is only August. The city, quite literally, is drowning. Allison This is not the first time I've experienced an epic flood in Houston. It was only 16 years ago that another tropical system, Allison, moved into the upper Texas coast. The storm had gone inland, up into the piney woods of Eastern Texas. But four days later it sagged back toward the coast and refueled itself on warmth and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. On the night of Friday, June 8, 2001, it would soak downtown Houston. I remember this night vividly. It predated the existence of smart phones, weather apps, and, well, I was younger and stupider then. So even though it was raining heavily that Friday evening, some friends and I left work and went to a local club to see a Bob Schneider show. The rain got so intense, that even as Schneider crooned songs from his new album, Lonelyland, we could hear the storms outside over the music. It was time to go. Outside, the roads were rushing with water, seeking their way to bayous, which in turn carry water out into the Gulf of Mexico. As I said my goodbyes and dashed to my car it dawned on me—how, exactly, was I going to get home? I'd recently bought a house a few miles northwest of downtown, but to get there from the club I'd have to cross Interstate 10, the freeway that spans the entirety of America, from Santa Monica, California to Jacksonville, Florida. That night, in central Houston, it had become a raging canal. I couldn't cross. My friends had been going the other way, they couldn't get anywhere either. The Saturday morning after Tropical Storm Allison was pretty bad. That night we ended up tromping around the Montrose area of Houston. It was such a surreal scene. The last thing you should do in floodwaters, especially at night, is to walk into them. You don't know how deep they are. You might stumble into a drain. And, yes, there are a few alligators and snakes in the bayous of Houston. But I was in my 20s then—again, young and stupid. Estimated as a 500-year flood by hydrologists, Allison was considered the reference inland rainfall event for Houston. At least now we knew how bad it could get here. The city could be hardened. When I finally made it home around noon the next day, I decided I didn't want to ever be caught unprepared for such a dire situation again. I began paying closer attention to the weather. As a science writer for the Houston Chronicle, I wrote stories about flooding and tropical weather. By Hurricane Katrina in 2005, I had a science blog and filled it with dispatches about the storm. Hurricane Rita followed three weeks later. By the time Hurricane Ike struck Texas in 2008, the third costliest hurricane in US history, I had the bug. I pursued a meteorology certification from Mississippi State University. I left the Chronicle in 2015 to cover space full time for Ars. But over the years I had built an audience I felt compelled to serve, so I started Space City Weather as kind of a hobby. And it more or less remained a hobby until last week, drawing perhaps 25,000 page views a week. I had some loyal fans, but really, who wanted to read forecasts day after day when the seven-day outlook called for hot, sunny days with a slight chance of rain? Harvey The atmospheric physics behind Harvey's prodigious rainmaking ability are pretty simple. A big low pressure system moves into the Texas coast, dragging a bunch of moisture with it. Usually, when big tropical systems achieve hurricane status, they have some capacity to forge their own steering currents. But when Hurricane Harvey made landfall, it ran into a ridge of high pressure over the southwestern United States. This blocked further movement. Once inland Friday night, Harvey was essentially a marble on a flat table, wobbling around. This is a particularly bad thing for people nearby such a storm, since it essentially becomes a conveyor belt for moisture from the Gulf to coastal areas. You've got this counter-clockwise circulation hoovering up moisture from the Gulf at lower levels of the atmosphere, creating a funnel of rising air. And when warm, moist air rises, it rains. And when a storm doesn't move far from the coast, it just keeps raining—and never really stops. Enlarge / Fact check: True. Harvey came inland about 200 miles south of Houston, and the outer rain bands pushed into Houston on Saturday, setting the stage for the first of several exceptionally wet nights. Houston lies a few dozen feet above sea level, and during normal rainfall residential yards drain into streets, streets drain into bayous, and bayous carry water into Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. But this was not normal rainfall; it was extreme tropical rainfall. Meteorologists measure rainfall rates in inches per hour at a given location. A rainfall rate of 0.5 inches per hour is heavy, while anything above 2.0 inches per hour is intense (you'd probably stop your car on a highway, pull over, and wait out the passing storm). Over Clear Creek near where I live, from 11pm to 1am that night, 10.6 inches of rain fell, about as much rainfall as New York City gets from October through December. That happened i n two hours. The next night, the heaviest band of rainfall set up over western Houston, where affluent suburbs are generally protected by two large reservoirs. The Addicks and Barker facilities were built before World War II following devastating floods in Houston. Combined they have a capacity to store about 400,000 acre-feet of water, or about the same amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls in 10 days. The reservoirs filled up for the first time ever during Harvey, forcing the US Army Corps of engineers to release water into bayous that were already flooded, worsening conditions downstream in central Houston. Dramatically, this occurred near the very height of the storm. It seems insane, but this was the best of several bad options. Had the Corps not done this, the dam walls might have failed, leading to a catastrophic release of a wall of water as much as 100 feet high.

Jessica Conditt,"With more data than ever and a rapidly evolving ecosystem, the Fourth National Climate Assessment lays out in clear, authoritative terms how humans are driving global warming, how its dangers are manifesting in our everyday lives, and how much worse it could become in the future. Here's how it begins: Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future -- but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur. The report lays out a handful of current catastrophes caused by climate change, including drought in the Colorado River Basin and Nebraska, dying coral reefs off the coasts of Hawaii, heavy flooding in Louisiana, unprecedented rain damaging farms across the Midwest, massive fires in the Northwest, and hurricanes in Texas. All of these disasters were catalyzed by human-driven climate change. No question. However, Light and other experts are still struggling to convince some people that climate change is a reality. Some people, like the President of the United States. ""It's a sense of frustration that we continue to have to fight yesterday's battles over and over and over again,"" Light said. President Donald Trump denies climate change as a fact, consistently calling into question the science behind global warming and undermining the authority of researchers in the field. Under Trump, the US has withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement (an international accord to curtail global warming), dismantled the Clean Power Plan (an Obama-era mandate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants), and unwoven clean-air proposals handled by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Trump administration was congressionally mandated to release the Fourth National Climate Assessment, and it did so on Black Friday, a chaotic day of full-bore capitalism and post-Thanksgiving coma observed across the country. Many climate scientists saw this move as an attempt to bury the report. On top of that, Trump tweeted the following message on November 21st, two days before the report's publication: ""Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?"" Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2018 ""Which is a fundamental mistake,"" Light said. ""There's been decades of trying to educate people that there's a difference between climate and weather.... One can't help but feeling disheartened when the President of the United States, who has access to the hundreds of government scientists that produced this report -- this is his government. He has access to them and there isn't any reason he should be making mistakes like that."" The Fourth National Climate Assessment isn't designed to make policy recommendations, and it doesn't. It's a comprehensive, apolitical investigation of climate change backed by more than 300 scientists, and it's also a warning. If steps aren't taken to slow the effects of climate change, the US can expect bigger fires, heavier floods, more destructive hurricanes, and all of the negative social consequences that come with. The report describes the future as follows: Climate change threatens to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities that result in higher exposure and sensitivity to extreme weather and climate-related events and other changes. Marginalized populations may also be affected disproportionately by actions to address the underlying causes and impacts of climate change, if they are not implemented under policies that consider existing inequalities. Unchecked, global warming poses dozens of threats to life on Earth, from rising sea levels and melting ice caps, to devastating drought, fire, famine and disease. Light called out a handful of real climate-change effects that are at the forefront of his mind, playing out right now: intense, long-lasting heat waves that pose a danger to people without access to air conditioning, and extreme rainfall making it more difficult for crops to grow in the Midwest. ""We can attribute the wider spread of certain kinds of diseases, especially tropical diseases and vector diseases, foodborne and waterborne diseases, toward changes in the climate,"" Light said. ""And this is a slowly but nonetheless increasingly unfolding public health crisis that is not terribly well acknowledged, but I think that all of us have to be more concerned about and we know will get worse as we move forward."" ""We don't have that leadership at the federal level right now."" While the federal government drags its feet on addressing climate change, states and cities are stepping up with clean-air protections of their own. For instance, the US is on track to uphold its obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement, due in part to efforts by the United States Climate Alliance, a bipartisan group of 17 governors committed to seeing the accord through a reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. ""We can avoid the worst scenarios and impacts that we talk about in the report, but it is something that's going to require a lot of more effort,"" Light said. ""We've got great leadership coming out of California in particular, but also more than a dozen other states, hundreds of cities, thousands of businesses, but we don't have that leadership at the federal level right now. That's the part where we have a lot of improvement we can still do."" The Fourth National Climate Assessment is clear. It doesn't inject politics into its science, and it doesn't mince words -- even in the introduction, which closes as follows: [The Fourth National Climate Assessment] concludes that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans' physical, social, and economic well-being are rising. These impacts are projected to intensify -- but how much they intensify will depend on actions taken to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the risks from climate change now and in the coming decades.","Hurricane Katrina claimed nearly 2,000 lives when it struck the Gulf Coast of the United States in 2005, submerging New Orleans in floodwater and devastating the region for more than a decade.

"USA TODAY, John Bacon, USA TODAY","José Campeche High School in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico still hasn’t seen any recovery money from state or federal agencies for repairs, said Candido Rivera, the school’s director. “Everything we’ve done, we’ve done by ourselves,” he said. Carrie Cochran/USA TODAY Network, Rick Jervis/USA TODAY The coastal surge from Hurricane Maria reached up to 5 feet or more, devastating the town of Toa Baja in Puerto Rico. (Photo: Ricky Flores, Carrie Cochran, USA TODAY NETWORK) Hurricane Maria likely killed thousands of people across Puerto Rico last year, more than 70 times the official estimate, a Harvard study released Tuesday says. Authorities in Puerto Rico placed the death toll at 64 after Maria roared through the island Sept. 20, destroying buildings and knocking out power to virtually the entire U.S. territory of more than 3 million people. Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, however, surveyed thousands of households on the battered island and found evidence of 4,645 ""excess deaths"" during the storm and the weeks that followed. The researchers said the number was conservative and that the death toll likely exceeded 5,000. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. ""Our results indicate that the official death count of 64 is a substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after Hurricane Maria,"" the study says. More: Voices: Hurricane Maria couldn't destroy Puerto Rico's spirit-lifting food More: Puerto Rico just lost power yet again in total blackout The study's total would make Maria the second most deadly hurricane in U.S. history. The Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900 killed more than 6,000 people. More than 1,800 people died when Katrina roared across the U.S. Gulf Coast as a Category 5 hurricane in 2005. More than 1,500 of those deaths were in Louisiana. The Harvard study notes that in Puerto Rico every disaster-related death must be confirmed by the Institute of Forensic Sciences. The system counts only bodies that are brought to San Juan or were confirmed by a medical examiner traveling to the local municipality. The system also fails to capture indirect deaths resulting from worsening of chronic conditions or from delayed medical treatments, the study says. ""These difficulties pose substantial challenges for the accurate and timely estimation of official all-cause hurricane-related mortality,"" the report says. Maria raked across Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest storm to hit the island in 89 years and among the strongest ever to strike the U.S. Maria was one of three horrific hurricanes in 2017 — Harvey and Irma were the others. All three are among the costliest hurricanes in U.S. history, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says. Maria caused an estimated $90 billion in damage, making it the third costliest ever in the United States. Katrina remains the costliest hurricane on record at $160 billion. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, has approved $1 billion in individual assistance grants for residents of Puerto Rico. More than $500 million has been designated for repairs to bridges, government buildings and other structures.

Aileen Kwun,"In the wake of 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, actor and celebrity Brad Pitt rose as an unlikely savior in New Orleans. His nonprofit housing foundation, Make It Right, stepped in to help rehabilitate the badly devastated Lower Ninth Ward with the development of more than 100 modular and affordable homes. Billed as energy-efficient, LEED Platinum-certified structures designed by star architects including Frank Gehry, David Adjaye, and others—and bolstered by the support of fellow celebrities, from Oprah to Ellen Degeneres—the ambitious philanthropic undertaking was even awarded a 2016 National Design Award by the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, among the design industry’s highest honors. Now, more than a decade on, Pitt’s foundation faces thorny complaints and the threat of a new lawsuit from residents of more than two dozen of those homes. “Essentially, Make It Right was making a lot of promises to come back and fix the homes that they initially sold these people and have failed to do so. We have some people who have gotten sick, or we believe to be sick,” attorney Ron Austin, who is filing the lawsuit on behalf of residents, told local New Orleans news station WWL-TV earlier this week. Austin points to a host of structural flaws, including damaged roofs, porches, steps and infrastructure, as well as health issues stemming from issues such as mold contamination. [Photo: Flickr user Mark Gstohl ] One owner of a Make It Right home, Nola Verrett, previously told Radar in 2013 that in her house, “the wood turned gray and it was also black. Also some parts it was buckling and it had mushrooms growing out of it. Different neighborhoods saw it, too.” The announcement from Austin, who is reported to be in the process of filing the lawsuit in the next few weeks, is only the latest of legal scuffles to hit Make It Right. Reports of rotting structures began to surface as early as 2014, attributed to the Make It Right’s use of TimberSIL, a glass-infused wood product that is touted for its non-toxic, waterproof, and durable composition, but which had proven unable to withstand New Orleans’ notoriously moist climate. ( Make It Right filed a $500,000 lawsuit against the wood manufacturer in 2015, as a result, though the settlement of that case remains unclear.) Last February, modular home installer Method Homes also filed a lawsuit against Make It Right, after failing to receive a payment for a batch of homes it had helped develop on Montana’s Fort Peck Reservation. Much of the foundation’s troubles likely stem from a lack of leadership, as Make It Right’s CEO Tom Darden, along with several of its board of directors, including its former Director of Innovations, Tim Duggan, were reported to have exited in 2016. To date, neither position appears to be filled on Make It Right’s staff page, nor are they listed on its current job listings page. “Honestly, [the foundation] has been really been off the radar for a few years now, and I think some of that has to do with the fact that the organization right now is sort of rudderless. I think it’s a little bit of a zombie organization. No one’s maintaining it,” says Martin Pedersen, founder of the New Orleans–based architecture nonprofit, Common Edge. “You have to do a lot of maintenance on any house in New Orleans, because it rains 70 inches a year, and the ground is sinking beneath every house in New Orleans houses, and not just Make It Right houses. The fancy houses in the Garden District? Guess what? Those are sinking too. That’s just a fact of life in New Orleans.”","Rotting structural issues and mold contamination are among the allegations surfacing from residents of New Orleans’ Lower 9th Ward, where Make It Right developed more than 100 houses after Hurricane Katrina.

Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — While Hurricane Florence barreled through the Carolinas, a different type of storm was brewing within the federal disaster relief agency tasked with responding to the fallout. The fate of Brock Long, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was cast in doubt with revelations that he was being investigated by Homeland Security's internal watchdog and a congressional committee for the possible misuse of government vehicles. The watchdog, the inspector general's office, has turned the review over to federal prosecutors to determine whether any criminal charges are warranted, according to a person familiar with the probe. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation and requested anonymity. Long, a well-respected emergency manager, says he is not focused on the probes. ""I am fully focused on those impacted by Hurricane Florence,"" he said in a statement Monday evening, after being asked for comment on the investigation. But some emergency management experts say the investigations are a distraction for the beleaguered agency as it deals with the worst storm of the year. Beverly Cigler, co-chair of a Hurricane Katrina task force set up by the American Society for Public Administration, said Long has been working hard but that ""any organization has to have active engaged leadership at the very top."" ""You don't want your FEMA administrator to be under investigation that's going to distract you somewhat no matter how focused you are,"" said Cigler, a Penn State distinguished professor emerita. Rafael Lemaitre, who was a senior FEMA official in the Obama administration, said the timing was troubling. ""For these allegations to emerge in the hours before landfall of a major hurricane is a huge distraction to the work the FEMA administrator is doing,"" he said. The agency is already under pressure after a grueling hurricane season last year that included Harvey, Irma and Maria. The federal response to Maria in Puerto Rico was widely criticized; President Donald Trump has lashed out over the criticism and suggested without evidence the revised death toll of nearly 3,000 was a conspiracy made up by Democrats. Long has not been asked to resign. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who oversees FEMA, has said she has confidence in him. Other Trump administration officials have lost their jobs over ethics issues related to travel, but they involved more outsized allegations. Long, 43, took over as FEMA administrator in June 2017. He has extensive emergency management experience — a federal requirement for the job since the Bush administration's bungled response to Katrina. He previously served in Alabama as the director of emergency management. The investigations center on whether Long used government-owned vehicles for visits home to Hickory, North Carolina. It's not uncommon for an inspector general to refer cases so federal prosecutors can determine whether charges are warranted, and it doesn't mean he'll be charged with a crime. Meanwhile, Long has until Oct. 1 to turn over documents to the House Oversight Committee related to travel and hotels possibly used by FEMA employees who were required to accompany him on the personal trips. Long has largely kept a low public profile during Florence. He'd been front-and-center at press briefings as FEMA managed Hurricane Lane in Hawaii earlier this month. After the news broke of the investigation last week, Long appeared at a briefing in Washington to say he was fully focused on the storm preparations and would fully comply with the probe. ""Doing something unethical is not part of my DNA and it's not part of my track record in my whole entire career,"" Long said then. But on Tuesday, he spoke at a North Carolina news conference with other emergency managers. ""It's really important for me to get out of D.C. and to be on the ground to be able to help North Carolina,"" Long said. State emergency management head Mike Sprayberry thanked him for his work, as did Gov. Roy Cooper. ""Right now FEMA is giving us what we need,"" Cooper said. Before the storm struck, FEMA had deployed more than 8 million bottles of water and meals, plus generators, blankets, tarps and cots to North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. It was acting on lessons learned following Maria, when it had underestimated the food and fresh water needed, and how hard it would be to get supplies to the island. It's too early to gauge FEMA's response. While the storm has moved away, the rivers are still rising.","Leah Millis/Reuters Brock Long, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is investigated by Homeland Security's internal watchdog and a congressional committee for the possible misuse of government vehicles.

Caroline Bologna,"Baby name trends tend to evolve gradually over time. But there are some names that experience precipitous drops in popularity or just completely fall off the map. The reason usually has to do with the news. Often, big news events can cause a name to rise in popularity. But, as these examples show, associations with controversy, disaster or mass murder can also cause a name’s popularity to tank. Katrina REUTERS/Vincent Laforet/Pool TBA/JJ An aerial view of the devastation in the greater New Orleans area following Hurricane Katrina on Aug. 30, 2005. Katrina is one of the most well-known examples of a baby name that plummeted in popularity following a major news event. After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in late August 2005, the name achieved a certain level of infamy. According to the Social Security Administration, 1,327 baby girls in the U.S. were named Katrina in 2005, and it was the 246th most popular name for girls. Social Security Administration In 2006, only 853 Katrinas were born, and the name dropped down to 379th most popular. The last year it appeared on the top 1000 names list was 2012, when it ranked at 941st. In 2016, only 190 baby girls were named Katrina. Interestingly, a 2012 New York Times report found a 9 percent increase in names that begin with the letter K following Hurricane Katrina. Caitlyn Danny Moloshok/Reuters TV personality Caitlyn Jenner in Beverly Hills on Feb. 28, 2016. When the Social Security Administration released its baby name data for 2016, one notable finding concerned the name Caitlyn. The year after Caitlyn Jenner came out as transgender, the four names that decreased in popularity the most were variations on the same name: Caitlin, Caitlyn, Katelynn and Kaitlynn. The name Caitlyn’s ranking fell from 598th to 1,060th. Caitlin dropped from 609th place to 1,151st, Katelynn fell from 652nd to 1,054th, and Katilynn went down from 994th to 1,375th. “It was inevitable,” Laura Wattenberg, founder of BabynameWizard.com, told The Associated Press. “Caitlyn was already falling in popularity. Now it is suddenly controversial.” Monica Photo by Harry Hamburg/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images Former White House intern and anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinsky in 2003. The name Monica peaked in popularity in 1977 at number 39 on the Social Security Administration list. That year, 6,366 baby Monicas were born. Over the next 20 years, the name slowly dropped down the list. In 1996, Monica was ranked at number 81, with 4,325 baby girls named Monica that year. In 1997, it was at number 79, with 4,223 baby Monicas. But after the Bill Clinton- Monica Lewinsky scandal came to light in 1998, the name took a sharper dive. That year, its popularity dropped to 105th place, with 3,229 baby Monicas born that year. In 1999, its ranking fell to 151st, with 2,133 babies named Monica that year. The name’s popularity has continued to decline, and in 2016, it ranked at number 589, with only 515 newborn Monicas. Isis REUTERS/Stringer A member of the self-described Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant waves a flag in Raqqa, Syria, on June 29, 2014. The name of Egyptian goddess Isis first appeared in Social Security Administration data in 1960, when five baby girls were given that name. A superhero show from the mid-1970s called “Isis” gave the name a bump in popularity ― in 1976, 124 newborn girls were named Isis. Isis again rose in popularity throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, peaking in 2005, when it was ranked the 522nd most popular name for girls in the U.S. with 561 babies named Isis born that year. Even Gabrielle Union’s character in the 2000 cult classic cheerleader movie, “Bring It On,” was named Isis. But as the terrorist group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) gained notoriety, the name’s popularity took a dive. In 2014, it had dropped from number 575 to number 704 in the rankings. By 2015, it had completely fallen off the top 1000 list. Only 53 baby girls were named Isis in 2016. Adolf Photos.com via Getty Images One white supremacist couple gained notoriety a few years ago for naming their son after Adolf Hitler. For obvious reasons, you aren’t likely to meet anyone named Adolf these days. But the name’s decline in popularity happened more gradually than you’d think. The name Adolf appears in the Social Security Administration’s earliest public data from the year 1880. From that year on, the agency compiled lists of all the baby names that had been given to five or more newborn boys or girls. In 1880, six baby boys were named Adolf. (The alternate spelling, Adolph, was given to between 80 and 120 children per year in the late 19th century. It peaked at 673 babies in 1917 before dwindling in subsequent decades.) The number of babies named Adolf for the most part remained in the single digits over the next three decades, but the number of baby Adolfs climbed up into the 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s in the 1910s. The name hovered around that level of popularity until the 1930s, when the number of baby boys named Adolf in a given year dropped into the teens. Nearing the end of World War II in 1944, only five U.S. newborns were named Adolf. The name did not appear in the data (meaning it was chosen for fewer than five baby boys or girls) in the years 1946, 1953, 1967, 1974, 1977 or 1978. It did appear in all the years in between, but never for more than 12 newborns. From 1984 to 1989, Adolf did not appear in the data. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the name didn’t truly fall off the list for good until after 1990, when five newborn boys were named Adolf. In the 1950s, the number of baby Adolphs born annually ranged from 117 to 153, but over the subsequent decades, that number dwindled until it reached the single digits in 2002. In 2016, seven newborn boys were named Adolph. So though the name was never particularly popular in the U.S., today it is incredibly rare. Still, a white supremacist family did make headlines in the new millennium after naming their son Adolf Hitler Campbell. Ellen Reuters Photographer/Reuters Actresses Ellen DeGeneres and Laura Dern during the taping of ABC's ""Ellen."" The name Ellen didn’t completely tank per se, but it saw a sharper decline in popularity after comedian and actress Ellen DeGeneres (and her sitcom character with the same first name) came out as lesbian. Between 1991 and 1996, the name Ellen dipped from the 209th most popular name for baby girls to the 245th most popular name. After DeGeneres came out and the famous “Puppy Episode” of “Ellen” aired in April 1997, the name saw a larger decline. The Social Security Administration In 1997, it dropped to number 346 and then down to 426 in 1998. The name Ellen bottomed out at number 742 in 2012, but in recent years, it’s gotten a little more love ― perhaps in part thanks to DeGeneres’ return to prominence and beloved daytime talk show.",And the likely reasons Americans rejected them.,2018-02-13T21:58:24Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",6 Baby Names That Have Tanked In Popularity,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unpopular-baby-names_us_5a77ded7e4b01ce33eb452c6,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8341d11e0000dc007ab98f.jpeg?ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,Hurricane Katrina,1
Travis Fedschun,"The Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be just as busy this year, but not as destructive as the record-breaking season in 2017, researchers said Thursday. The pre-season forecast from Colorado State University’s Tropical Meteorology Project calls for 14 named storms, of which seven are predicted to strengthen into hurricanes, with three becoming major storms that are Category 3 or higher. Hurricane researchers note that warm waters in the western Atlantic Ocean and a weaker El Niño may be blamed for an uptick in storms. ""El Niño tends to increase upper-level westerly winds across the Caribbean into the tropical Atlantic, tearing apart hurricanes as they try to form,"" the researchers said in their report. Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Jose (R) and Hurricane Katia (L) are pictured in the Atlantic Ocean in this September 7, 2017 NOAA satellite photo. (NOAA) The research team predicts that 2018 hurricane activity will be about 135 percent of the average season. By comparison, 2017’s hurricane season was about 245 percent of the average season and featured Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which devastated parts of the United States and portions of the Caribbean. PUERTO RICO IN 'FRAGILE STATE' SIX MONTHS AFTER HURRICANE MARIA The lead author of the report, Phil Klotzbach, said that the 2018 hurricane season is exhibiting characteristics similar to 1960, 1967, 1996, 2006 and 2011. “The years 1960, 1967 and 2006 had near-average Atlantic hurricane activity, while 1996 and 2011 were both above-normal hurricane seasons,” he said. Hurricane Joaquin is seen over the Bahamas in the Atlantic Ocean in an image from the NOAA GOES West satellite taken October 1, 2015.

Adrian Florido,"Cynthia Caldero and her husband Obdulio Cordero's little wooden home was leveled by Hurricane Maria. But they were denied a FEMA repair grant because they couldn't prove they owned it. After appealing for five months, a nonprofit finally stepped in to helped them rebuild. Adrian Florido/NPR José López doesn't have a deed for the little house at the edge of a dairy farm where he was raised and still lives — only the stories his grandfather told him about how the house came to be. It began with an agreement between gentlemen 39 years ago. His grandfather, a foreman on the farm, needed a house for his recently divorced daughter, López's mother. So he asked the farm's owner if he could have a little corner of the sprawling estate to build her one. ""My grandfather worked on the farm for 44 years,"" López said, ""and his boss was a good man. He said yes."" In the four decades since, the family kept the modest house up – adjusting the floorplan, rebuilding the balcony. Back then, when people made agreements, all that mattered was their word and a handshake. José López ""But Hurricane Maria wiped that away,"" López said. He knew the storm would be a monster. He didn't expect it to tear off the roof. He covered the gaping hole using wood pallets, tarps, and recycled sheet metal. Then a week after the storm, he climbed the hill behind the house in search of cell reception. Using his phone, he filled out an application for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, hoping for a grant to repair the roof quickly. But six months after Hurricane Maria devastated this island commonwealth, he says FEMA has yet to approve his application. The problem is that gentlemen's agreement 39 years ago. ""They say I have to justify why I don't have title to the house,"" he said. ""But back then, when people made agreements, all that mattered was their word and a handshake."" Puerto Rico still has huge challenges ahead, key among them the task of repairing hundreds of thousands of homes that the hurricane damaged or destroyed. One impediment to that goal is the fact that FEMA has denied many families crucial federal repair grants because, like José López, they've been unable to prove ownership of their homes. Villas del Sol is an informal community that was founded in 2010, after its residents were evicted from another parcel of land they had occupied without permission. The community has dozens of homes, but none have individual titles. Adrian Florido/NPR The situation is not without precedent. Some families in New Orleans faced a similar problem after Hurricane Katrina flooded that city in 2005. But in Puerto Rico it is a problem of unprecedented scope, because the island's government estimates that more than half of houses here are ""informal"" – meaning they were built without permits, and lack title. Of the nearly 1.2 million applications for help that FEMA has received in Puerto Rico, roughly 60 percent have been found ineligible for what the agency calls Individual and Household grants, which can but do not necessarily include money to repair storm damage. The reasons for ineligibility are many and the agency did not provide specific denial numbers. But in an email to NPR, FEMA confirmed that a main reason it has denied these grants in Puerto Rico has been applicants' inability to verify that they own the homes for which they are claiming damage. José López says he's spent months trying to get FEMA the documents its workers have told him they need before approving a grant for repairs. Last week, a lawyer helped him write an affidavit swearing the house is his. As he's waited, he's kept making patchwork repairs. His roof looks better now, but he still has to move his mattress to the living room when it rains, to avoid getting wet. Lyvia Rodriguez del Valle works with one of Puerto Rico's largest informal communities, where many residents have been denied FEMA grants because they don't have title to their properties. Adrian Florido/NPR Despite steps FEMA says it has taken to ease its documentation requirements – such as by accepting sworn affidavits from people who lack a deed – housing advocates say many people are still being denied, often for inconsistent reasons that even lawyers are struggling to sort out. ""I've seen many people being denied three or four times, and just deciding it's not worth the stress,"" said Sarah Delgado, an attorney volunteering with a legal aid group that's helping people appeal their denials. ""They're getting discouraged, and they're just giving up."" Many people have few other options for rebuilding, she said. The magnitude of the problem reflects an array of historical, social, and legal factors that have found perfect confluence in post-disaster Puerto Rico. On one side, there's the federal agency charged with providing billions of dollars in disaster relief but also with being vigilant against fraudulent claims, deploying a long list of eligibility and documentation requirements to guard against them. They're requirements that many Puerto Ricans can't meet. On the other, there's an island territory unlike any U.S. state, where property law is different and a majority of houses lack title or proper construction permits. Many cases resemble Jose López's – a house built on a friend or family member's property with their permission. Then there are the tens of thousands of families who live in what began as squatter settlements but over time have taken on the trappings of more formal communities. It's a phenomenon that politicians have often turned a blind eye to, often even abetted, because the proliferation of informal housing has released pressure on demands for affordable housing. Hurricane Maria damaged Angel Manuel Martinez's roof, but FEMA has denied him a grant to repair it in part because he doesn't have the deed. The house is on city land, but it's been his family's for more than 50 years. Adrian Florido/NPR ""It's something that has been there forever, and we were just blessed never to have had a hurricane like the one we did,"" said Fernando Gil Enseñat, Puerto Rico's housing secretary. Hurricane Maria, he said, revealed ""all of the flaws"" in the island's housing policies dating back to the 1930s and 40s, when modernization policies aimed at industrialization drew people from the mountainous countryside to the cities. ""There were too many people coming down and not enough public housing,"" Gil said. ""So what did they do? Parcels of land that were devoted to agricultural sites, people invaded them and made their communities there. Time passed by, nobody paid attention, and meanwhile mayors or representatives started building roads for them, and connecting them into the utility systems."" What many families never got was formal title, and it's one of the major issues the island's housing officials face as they try to figure out how people with no legal right to their properties will get the help they need to repair them. Gil said one plan is to use federal disaster relief money to grant deeds to some 48,000 families that the housing department has record of as living on undeeded property. That number, however, represents only a fraction of such families island-wide. Calls to adjust the rules But housing advocates say such fixes do not address the immediate need that many families still have to repair the roofs over their heads six months after the storm. They argue that the federal government should also recognize Puerto Rico's unique housing reality and adjust its rules accordingly. ""Recognizing that there is an issue of informality in Puerto Rico that's quite widespread, it's very important that the policies that are being implemented find ways to make this assistance available to people that need it,"" said Lyvia Rodriguez del Valle, who directs Proyecto ENLACE, a nonprofit that works with one of the island's largest informal communities in San Juan. FEMA says it is being flexible. For example, it started accepting sworn affidavits from people who can't provide a property deed or otherwise prove that they own their home. ""If they're willing to sign an affidavit that states that that property is theirs, then we're going to honor that,"" said Michael Byrne, the top FEMA official in Puerto Rico. But that does not mean his agency can abandon controls on the housing assistance program, he said. Applicants who've sworn they own their property but are still getting denied are likely missing something else in the application, he said. ""My answer to them is keep talking to us. Come see us."" ""This is taxpayer dollars and we have to be responsible stewards."" Byrne said. ""Not only are we following our rules, but we are also following the rules of compassion."" He said his guidance to staff processing requests for assistance is not aimed at ""incentivizing no's. We're incentivizing doing whatever we can to help the family."" Not only are we following our rules, but we are also following the rules of compassion. Michael Byrne For Cynthia Caldero, it hasn't exactly felt like that. Since Hurricane Maria leveled her tiny one room house, she says FEMA has denied her application for a home repair grant four times. She keeps the denial letters in a little black backpack. ""Assistance not approved,"" they read, ""because you were unable to prove that you owned the home at the time of the disaster."" Though Caldero and her husband built the little house themselves, it's true they can't prove they own it. They live in a community called Villas del Sol, which its residents founded in 2010 after the government evicted them from a parcel of land off the highway that they had occupied without permission for several years. Though their new community is on a flood plain, they at least have permission to be there. But Villas del Sol is built on a single parcel, with no individual titles. After the hurricane crumbled their home, Caldero, her husband, and teenaged son took shelter at the neighborhood's community center, under a small portion of the roof that survived. Every so often, she'd go pick up mail at the post office where she gets it delivered, find another FEMA denial letter, and try again, she said, to justify why she couldn't prove she owned her home. So far it hasn't been enough. ""Now they're requesting a letter from the organization that manages this parcel of land,"" she said, ""So I'm trying to get it. I've already told my husband that if they deny me a fifth time, I'm giving up. I'm not going to ask again."" It's not as urgent anymore anyway, she said. FEMA did replace her destroyed furniture and appliances, and last month a nonprofit showed up and put up four bright blue wooden walls and a roof, allowing her to finally move out of the hollowed out community center and back into her house. If FEMA were to approve her request for help with structural repairs, she said, she'd use the money to replace the thin wooden walls with concrete. ""Otherwise the next hurricane will just blow it all away again,"" she said.","Six months after Hurricane Maria devastated this island commonwealth, many families are unable to get crucial federal repair grants because they've been unable to prove they own their homes.",2018-03-20T19:47:45Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Unable To Prove They Own Their Homes, Puerto Ricans Denied FEMA Help",https://www.npr.org/2018/03/20/595240841/unable-to-prove-they-own-their-homes-puerto-ricans-denied-fema-help,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/03/20/Cynthia_Caldero_wide-6f0445f561d21e26f279d618f73de3890019844c.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,Hurricane Katrina,1
"Jamelle Bouie, Jamelle Bouie","An aerial view of houses affected by the passing of Hurricane Maria in Naranjito, Puerto Rico, on Oct. 23. When Hillary Clinton was running against Donald Trump in 2016, she boiled down concerns about his temperament to a central question: “Imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States,” she said. The attack was centered on national security, but the argument went beyond the role of commander in chief to broader questions about Trump’s ability to handle any number of potential crises. How would he react to a public health emergency? How would he deal with a natural disaster? We now have an answer to this question as the scope of devastation from Hurricane Maria becomes more clear. What we have learned is that there are life-and-death consequences to putting someone like Donald Trump in command of the federal government. The profound failure of leadership and management that Trump’s critics feared has actually happened, and we are just now learning the scale of that disaster. Puerto Ricans were still recovering from Hurricane Irma when Maria made landfall last autumn. The storm devastated the island, destroying homes and crippling vital infrastructure. The crisis that ensued demanded an immediate and robust response from the federal government. But the response was sluggish, even as early reports made clear that this was a serious tragedy in the making. The White House made few preparations in the lead-up to the storm, and it was weeks before the Federal Emergency Management Agency committed its full resources to the island. During that time, clean water was scarce, food was hard to find, and hospitals struggled to care for patients, some with serious injuries and illnesses. Most of Puerto Rico lacked electricity for months, and medical supplies were few and far between. When FEMA did eventually act, it dropped the ball. To deliver 30 million meals, the agency contracted with an Atlanta-based wedding caterer with no experience in emergency management. By the time the company’s contract was terminated, it had delivered just 50,000 of those meals. The impact of those missteps wasn’t immediately clear. According to the government, only 64 people died in the disaster, compared to more than 1,800 who are estimated to have died in Hurricane Katrina. Trump noted that difference when he visited the island. “Every death is a horror,” said Trump, “but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous—hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here, with really a storm that was just totally overpowering, nobody’s ever seen anything like this.” He was congratulating himself, and even took to Twitter to complain of unfair treatment from those who faulted the administration’s response: “Nobody could have done what I’ve done for #PuertoRico with so little appreciation. So much work!” We now know this initial death toll was likely wrong by many orders of magnitude. Tracking deaths is always difficult in the wake of such a serious disaster, but recent research makes it clear that the federal government grossly undercounted the number of people who died due to this hurricane. After a review of mortality data, both the New York Times and the Center for Investigative Journalism estimated more than 1,000 deaths from the hurricane and its aftermath. A new Harvard study, released on Tuesday and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, estimated that at least 4,465 people died as a result of Hurricane Maria, which would make it the deadliest natural disaster to strike the United States since 1900, when a powerful hurricane devastated Galveston, Texas, and surrounding areas, killing at least 8,000 people. The researchers, who surveyed thousands of randomly selected homes in Puerto Rico, asked residents about deaths and extrapolated from the results, attributing many of the deaths to hospital disruptions and loss of basic utility services. A faster, stronger response would have prevented some of those deaths. Even if the White House was unprepared when the storm initially hit, much of the aftermath could have been averted if President Trump had focused his administration on the disaster and brought the weight of the federal government to bear on the unfolding tragedy. Instead, Trump sent every signal that he simply didn’t care. He downplayed the devastation to Puerto Rico and blamed Puerto Ricans for not doing more to repair the damage. He went after the mayor of San Juan, who had criticized the government’s response. He didn’t use his Twitter account to publicize relief efforts or generally encourage Americans to help. What he did do during that time, however, was campaign for political allies and start a feud with black football players. Puerto Rico is part of the United States, Puerto Ricans are Americans citizens, and as president, Donald Trump had a responsibility to assist them as they battled disaster. He didn’t, and the result was suffering and death on a massive scale. The extraordinary scandals of the Trump administration—including the president’s public effort to shield himself and his associates from wrongdoing—are important. But they should not blind us to the very real weight of his more ordinary transgressions. Donald Trump failed Puerto Rico, and no one should forget it.

John Timmer,"Enlarge / For a prepper, this is badly undergoing it. reader comments 7 ""Prepping,"" or getting ready to live without societal support, is apparently a largely American activity, and a recent one. Companies that cater to people who want to be self-reliant for food, water, and power have grown their revenue by about 700 percent over the last decade, and prepper products are now offered in places like Costco, Kmart, and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. But it's not at all clear what's driving this growth—why are more people getting ready for society's collapse? Some explanations focus on a tendency toward paranoia in American society or fears of terrorism or natural disaster. But actual evidence that directly supports any of these ideas as the main reason is pretty sparse. So Michael Mills at the UK's University of Kent decided to correct this gap in our knowledge. Mills went on an American road trip, spending time talking to (and butchering animals with) 39 preppers in 18 different US states. Rather than rampant paranoia, Mills suggests, preppers are motivated by non stop media coverage of natural disasters, as well as a government that encourages them to prepare for the worst. The sum of all fears To the extent that one exists, the public image of a prepper is of someone who's getting ready for the collapse of society, at which point money and electric grids, along with all the things that depend on them, will become unavailable. Preppers are ready to purify water to drink, hunt and butcher for meals, and scare off anyone who tries to get a piece of their post-apocalyptic bliss, possibly via gunfire. There may be bunkers involved. But that image is fostered in part by the public's biggest route to being made aware of preppers: Doomsday Preppers, which aired on the National Geographic channel. (The show has also infiltrated the academic literature, as Mills cites a study that analyzed the psychology of people who appeared on the show.) Although Mills doesn't explicitly say it, it's reasonable to wonder whether one can get an accurate cross-section of the prepper community purely from watching people who were chosen to appear on the show based on whether they make for good television. To find out, Mills placed ads on some popular prepper websites, recruited his cohort, and started his road trip. His goal wasn't a quantitative study; it was ethnography, which is largely talking to people, spending time with them, and seeing whether there are commonalities in how they think. It's important to note that regardless of how popular these prepper sites are, they probably won't produce a full cross-section of the prepper community, either, nor will selecting people based on willingness to talk to a researcher. That said, you'll still probably get more depth than you would by selecting for great TV. In fact, one of the subjects specifically told Mills that ""it’s not like on [National Geographic’s] Doomsday Preppers."" They weren't preparing for the total collapse of society. They were getting ready to deal with a local collapse of services that might last a few months. It's less Armageddon and more Hurricane Irma—which hadn't hit yet while Mills was doing his interviews but has since suggested that preparing for a couple of months without key services may be badly underestimating needs. Prepper supplies would typically be enough to only hold out that long, and Mills said they often referred to these caches as ""more than they'd ever need."" Another key difference is that the researchers didn't have any specific expectations for a particular disaster that's likely to happen. Some of them lived in flood-prone areas but would invariably mention additional fears like terrorism or outbreaks of new diseases. And for many of them, those risks didn't produce a sense that disaster was inevitable. Preparing was more a just-in-case activity. As Mills concluded, ""Their concerns tend to emerge in response to numerous disaster risks that are widely reported and recognized in wider American culture."" Media and government Tornadoes, hurricanes, fire, earthquakes—there are few areas of the country with no natural disaster risks, and terrorism and disease outbreaks could happen nearly anywhere. So what factors drive some people to respond to those risks by being ready to do without both private and government services or any sort of emergency support? One factor, Mills argues, is that the organizations responsible for coordinating that emergency support tell them they should be ready to deal without it. ""Federal agencies have recently encouraged American citizens to contemplate surviving disasters without their assistance,"" Mills writes, citing a previous study. And the government also warns people to be ready for risks that have never materialized. Since 2003, a group within the Department of Homeland Security has advocated that people ""have a ‘safe room’, duct tape, and plastic sheets on-hand to secure their home against (unprecedented) chemical terrorist attacks."" A second motivation comes from the media, which tends to provide nonstop coverage of natural disasters and their aftermath. Mills said nearly every subject mentioned Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy, or both. Mills' road trip took place in 2004, and Ebola and ISIS both made frequent appearances in the risks mentioned by the preppers (as they might again today). His conclusion, then, is that preppers are responding to what they're hearing: ""prepping is a phenomenon with clear, previously unacknowledged links to broader risk communications and concerns in the twenty-first century United States."" In other words, prepping might be an unusual response to the challenges everyone faces when trying to communicate risks to the public, but it's on a spectrum of responses, rather than being a distinct phenomenon. That, as Mills notes, still leaves a couple of key questions, like why the response is so prevalent in the US, and why plenty of US citizens face the same risks but can't even be bothered to store some jugs of water or pack a go-bag.",Motivations include lots of government warnings and media coverage of disasters.,2018-05-25T14:10:48Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",What exactly are “preppers” prepping for?,https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/05/what-exactly-are-preppers-prepping-for/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emergency_supply_kit-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,Hurricane Katrina,1
"kloria@techinsider.io (Kevin Loria), Kevin Loria","Lemon cannot kill deadly bacteria. Shutterstock A Texas woman died 21 days after being infected by a bacteria that can cause necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease. She was likely infected either by eating contaminated oysters or wading in brackish water where the bacteria live. This is a very rare condition, but it can be deadly. On October 15, 2017, Jeanette LeBlanc died after fighting a gruesome bacterial infection for 21 days. According to local news, LeBlanc and her wife Vicki Bergquist had been visiting family in Louisiana and spent the day crabbing along the coast. They purchasing a sack of raw oysters at a market, then shucked and ate them. ""About 36 hours later she started having extreme respiratory distress, had a rash on her legs and everything,"" Bergquist told KLFY, a local CBS affiliate. LeBlanc reportedly developed ""severe wounds"" on her legs, and doctors informed her that she had a bacterial infection known as vibriosis. LeBlanc's condition worsened for weeks before she succumbed. There are approximately a dozen different types of Vibrio bacteria that can cause various forms of vibriosis. Most are unpleasant but resolve within a few days, but one rare type can cause a ""flesh-eating"" or necrotizing fasciitis condition that kills up to 30% of those infected. Skin lesions caused by Vibrio vulnificus bacteria after Hurricane Katrina. CDC Vibriosis, flesh-eating bacteria, oysters, and brackish water There are approximately 80,000 vibriosis infections in the US every year, according to the CDC. Estimates suggest 52,000 of those cases are likely the result of eating contaminated food, especially raw seafood. About 80% of those infections occur between May and October, when water is particularly warm — ideal for colonies of bacteria to grow and thrive. The vast majority of vibriosis infections result in symptoms typical of a foodborne illness: cramping, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fever, and chills. One specific form of Vibrio bacteria, Vibrio vulnificus, is more dangerous. This infection can cause blistering skin lesions, bloodstream infections, and necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease, which causes soft tissue to die) if a wound gets infected. But it's very rare: CDC estimates are that there are about 205 cases in the US every year. When treatment is possible, understanding that flesh-eating disease has been caused by Vibrio is important, since it's treated differently from other bacteria. Other bacteria can cause flesh-eating disease as well — in fact, Vibrio bacteria are far less likely to cause these infections than group A Streptococcus bacteria and some other types. But flesh-eating disease is one of the most common signs of Vibrio vulnificus, according to one study. David McNew/Getty Images Are oysters responsible? If LeBlanc died of vibriosis, V. vulnificus would be the likely culprit. Still, it's unclear how she was infected. Most headlines have focused on raw oyster consumption, since people can contract the condition by eating raw seafood that's infected with V. vulnificus. One study conducted by the Florida state health office found the infection was the leading cause of death from foodborne illness between 1981 and 1992. During that time there were at least 72 infections, mostly caused by eating raw oysters, and 36 deaths. According to the CDC, there's no way to know if an oyster carries bacteria like Vibrio. But it's also possible that wading in brackish water (a mix of salty and fresh) while crabbing could have exposed LeBlanc to the bacteria, especially if she had cuts or scrapes on her legs. Hurricane floodwaters after Harvey resulted in at least one fatality from flesh-eating bacteria and there were several Vibrio deaths after Katrina. For people with serious vibriosis, antibiotics can treat some cases. Others result in amputations or death. People with liver conditions are much more likely to get severely ill. The CDC and other health departments have warned that the only way to kill bacteria is to properly cook oysters. Warmer waters (which are becoming more common) make raw oysters even riskier to consume, Bill Marler, a lawyer who focuses on food poisoning cases, previously told Business Insider. That fact was enough to convince him never to eat raw shellfish. However, cases like LeBlanc's are exceedingly rare. Whether or not wading in partially salty water or eating raw seafood are worth the risk is an individual decision.","Shutterstock A Texas woman died 21 days after being infected by a bacteria that can cause necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease.

ABC News,"San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz called Tuesday’s announcement of new death toll estimates in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria “a day of collective mourning” for the weather -battered island. Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. “It was a very painful day… but it came to put a number on what we already know – that the total death toll was not correct and that the government was not telling the truth,” Yulin Cruz told ABC News. Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health estimated that between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, there were 4,645 ""excess deaths,"" according to the report in the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers say the death toll may be more than 70 times the official estimate. Puerto Rico's official government death toll currently stands at 64. “This number [is] for “when government don’t do what they are supposed to do,” the mayor said as she pointed to a hat bearing the numbers 4,645 as a reminder of the hurricane ’s deadly toll. (flipped this sentence around). “It isn’t the smiles of the ones I got to that will haunt me forever, it is the pain of those we didn’t get to that will stick with me forever,” an emotional Yulin Cruz said. Miguel Garcia removes debris in what is left of his home after Hurricane Maria hit the island in September 2017, in Maunabo, Puerto Rico, January 27, 2018. The Harvard report relied on household surveys to generate the estimate, which researchers said had a margin of error of plus or minus 3,852, meaning the actual number of deaths could be as low as 793 or as high as 8,498. However. Researchers said the likely figure is about 5,000. The mayor of Puerto Rico’s capital has been a fierce critic of the Trump administration. In the days following Maria, Trump visited the island and said “every death is a horror. “But if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here,” he continued, “sixteen versus literally thousands of people.” “Not one tweet from a man that tweets about the sunrise…to say, people of Puerto Rico, we are sorry, “ a frustrated Yulin Cruz said. “Don’t accept the blame, because Lord knows he is incapable of doing,” she said of Trump. “But just say sorry, I’m sorry that lives were lost.” Houses damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Maria stand at the squatter community of Villa Hugo in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, Dec. 11, 2017. The Atlantic hurricane season starts on Friday – something that Yulin Cruz says the island is not equipped to handle again. “Puerto Rico is not prepared…we’ve learned about the things we fell short and we are in a better position to handle them,” she said. “We hope that we do not have to handle them anymore,” she said. Her “4,645“ hat is just one of the small reminders she keeps more than eight months after Maria. “I wrote with chalk on my wall ‘NEVER AGAIN’ and the number 4,645,” she said. “These are people – grandparents and mothers and children that will never be able to live because others weren’t able to help them survive.”",Hurricane Maria's true death toll in Puerto Rico may be 70 times higher.,2018-05-30T21:57:18Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",San Juan mayor says that deaths following Hurricane Maria still haunt her,https://abcnews.go.com/US/san-juan-mayor-deaths-hurricane-maria-haunt/story?id=55534319,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/puerto-rico-hurricane-season-02-ap-mt-180526_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,Hurricane Katrina,1
Kaitlyn Schallhorn,"When it comes to hurricanes, it’s all in a name. Katrina will forever bring to mind the unbridled devastation in Louisiana in 2005 as one of the costliest hurricanes in the U.S. on record. Maria recalls the destruction and massive loss of lives – particularly in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands – in 2017. With Maria, nearly 3,000 people in Puerto Rico were killed as a result of the hurricane. And Harvey, also one of the costliest storms, is reminiscent of the catastrophe it brought to Texas and Louisiana in 2017. For Atlantic hurricanes, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) recycles a list of names every six years – a process that is maintained by the World Meteorological Organization, the NHC explains. But you won’t find Harvey, Katrina or Maria – along with many others – in those lists because they have been “retired.” Katrina was retired in 2005, along with Dennis, Rita, Stan and Wilma. In 2017, Harvey and Maria were retired, in addition to Irma and Nate. TRACK HURRICANE FLORENCE HERE To retire a storm name – and have it removed from the list – the hurricane must be “so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for obvious reasons of sensitivity,” according to the NHC. The name will be officially removed from the lists during an annual meeting by the World Meteorological Organization committee, NHC said. HURRICANE FLORENCE COULD BRING CATASTROPHIC STORM SURGES: WHAT ARE THEY AND HOW CAN YOU PREPARE? As of Thursday morning, Hurricane Florence was a monster Category 2 storm barreling toward the Carolinas. Forecasters have warned that the widening storm – and its likelihood of lingering around the coast day after day after day – will bring surging ocean water and torrential rain with the possibility of catastrophic inland flooding that could swamp homes, businesses, farms and industrial sites.

Leah Rocketto,"Hurricanes bring about a number of dangers for people in its path, and Hurricane Florence is no exception. The now-Category 1 storm has been making its way toward the Carolina's all week, forcing the governments to issue mandatory evacuation notices. Although forcing people out of state keeps many residents safe, it puts those in the middle of addiction recovery in danger. ""Addicts require qualified care to manage their addictions into a state of remission,"" Brook McKenzie, director of clinical outreach at New Method Wellness, told INSIDER. ""If that care becomes inconsistent, or falls into a state of neglect, the results can be devastating, leading directly to relapse."" And in North Carolina, where deaths by drug overdose increased by 22% between 2016 and 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, consistency of care is especially crucial. In crisis situations, recovering addicts may lose their daily routines and face additional stress, which are both associated with relapse ""Routine and structure are important parts of building a sober life, especially in early sobriety,"" Katie Serra, a registered psychiatric nurse at McLean Hospital, told INSIDER. ""Most sober houses or halfway houses require residents to have daytime structure, whether that be a day treatment program or a job."" In North Carolina, drug overdose increased by 22 percent between 2016 and 2017 AP This routine keeps their minds — and in some cases, bodies — too occupied to think about or even crave drugs. But, as Serra noted, ""natural disasters obviously interrupt this structure, leaving users vulnerable to relapse and overdose."" It also leaves them worried about where to go and how to stay safe. Such stress can trigger relapse by activating the kappa opioid receptors in the region of the brain where, ""neural activities leading to a stress-induced drug relapse take place,"" as HuffPost reports. Patients can also suffer intense withdrawal symptoms, forcing them to turn to drugs to relieve the pain Recovering from addiction is as much a physical task as it is a mental one. ""The addict may require medical detox, the process of ridding the body of harmful toxins related to alcohol and drug abuse,"" McKenzie said. During this detox, a patient will likely suffer from withdrawal. Though the symptoms will vary depending on the type and length of addiction, the American Addiction Centers notes that people in withdrawal will likely experience flu-like symptoms, restlessness, tremors, depression, and anxiety. ""All of these are hard to deal with on an ordinary day, but factor in a lack of water, electricity, socialization, and support system, and that makes it all the worse,"" Bernadette Calicchio, who oversees HIV/HCV testing and linkage to care at the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition (NCHRC), told INSIDER. Fortunately, there are medications, such as methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone, that can blocks opiate receptors and relieve withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, you have to receive regulated daily doses for this to be effective — a problem when you are being forced to evacuate. When this happens, patients will turn to their drug of choice to relieve the symptoms. Such was the case during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. A 2011 paper found that low-income users experienced panic and showed signs of withdrawal during Hurricane Katrina due to difficulties maintaining their habits and treatments. In order to cope, some turned to drugs being offered in the Superdome. Local residents wait with their belongings for the New Orleans Superdome to open as an emergency shelter ahead of Hurricane Katrina Chris Graythen/Getty ""At one point they just started givin' it away, you know, because it was nothin' they could do with it,"" Fatigue, a crack and marijuana user told the authors of the paper. ""It was just a whole bunch of people in one big place tryin' to survive."" New York users faced a similar situation when Hurricane Sandy struck in 2012, according to a 2015 report. Roughly half of the 300 people interviewed were participating in a drug-related-maintenance therapy at the time of the storm. Of those people, about 46% were unable to obtain sufficient take-home doses of their medications and, as a result, had to use ""informal sources"" to avoid withdrawal. Additionally, the authors noted that 27% of users interviewed said they shared drug injection or preparation equipment with strangers. The practice of sharing needles, of any kind, increases a person's risk of contracting HIV or other diseases. To combat relapse and HIV contraction during Hurricane Florence, patients are being given take-home medications and have access to mobile services ""NC Harm Reduction Center kept our doors open at our fixed sites and mobile services up until the weather declined in an effort to deliver clean supplies (naloxone, syringes, cotton, metal cookers, tourniquets, and sterile water packs) for our participants to have throughout the storm,"" Calicchio told INSIDER. ""We made every effort to over-supply everyone we saw to make sure they'd have more than enough rather than not enough."" The center also passed out large quantities of Naloxone, a medication designed to reverse an opioid overdose. Serra added that the clinics also provide shelters with the medication and supplies. A deputy secretary for North Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services also announced via Twitter that ""opioid treatment programs have been advised to provide patients with four to six days of take-home medication to treat opioid-use disorders during the storm."" However, ""there is always a risk when take-home dosing is involved,"" Calicchio said. To combat the risk, most medically assisted treatment clinics require patients to complete at least two months of an intensive outpatient program before being allowed take-home doses. ""A lot of patients are aware that if they over-medicate, they will deplete their resource and ultimately end up in a state of withdrawal,"" she said. There are also outlets for mental and emotional support Serra encouraged those in recovery to use all available resources when stripped of their treatment program. For those with access to a phone, she recommended the Disaster Distress hotline (1-800-985-5990), which provides counseling to people experiencing ""emotional distress related to natural or human-caused disasters."" Similarly, Narcotic Anonymous and SMART Recovery provide online meetings and support groups for those struggling.

Katharine Jackson,"(Reuters) - Virginia Democratic Governor Ralph Northam has come under fire for having appeared in blackface after a conservative website released a photograph from his 1984 medical school yearbook page showing one person in blackface and another wearing Ku Klux Klan robes. 
Northam denied being one of the two people in the picture but admitted to putting on blackface to imitate pop star Michael Jackson in the 1980s. 
The blackface practice dates back to 19th century minstrel shows that caricatured slaves. Civil rights advocates say it has long been used to demean African-Americans. 
Here are some recent instances of reaction to practicing or defending the use of blackface: 
- Florida’s Republican secretary of state, Michael Ertel, resigned on Jan. 24 after the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper published photos from a Halloween party 14 years earlier showing him in blackface wearing a T-shirt reading: “Katrina Victim,” a reference to the hurricane that devastated New Orleans. Ertel apologized in a Facebook post on Sunday, according to media reports. 
- Two University of Oklahoma students withdrew from school in January after a video posted to social media showed one young woman painting her face black and using a racial slur while another student filmed. The Snapchat post set off an eruption online, with many fellow students calling for expulsion. The university condemned the incident in a letter announcing the students’ decision to leave. 
- Television anchor Megyn Kelly left her NBC morning show, “Megyn Kelly Today,” in October after making on-air remarks defending blackface as part of Halloween costumes. Kelly apologized the next day, but her show was canceled and she left the network. 
- Edwardsville, Illinois, Mayor Hal Patton, was running for the state Senate in 2018 when the Belleville News-Democrat newspaper published a photo of him in blackface at a Halloween party a decade earlier. Patton, who admitted in a statement to local media that the photo was of him dressed as a rapper, lost the race. 
- Actress Julianne Hough angered fans and fellow celebrities in 2013 by painting her face black when she dressed up for Halloween as the character ‘Crazy Eyes’ from the Netflix series “Orange Is the New Black.” Facing criticism from Twitter users, Hough apologized.

https://www.facebook.com/emily.wax.7,"Working through the night on little sleep and lots of Mountain Dew and adrenaline, Taylor Fontenot, the Texas captain of an-all volunteer group known as America’s Cajun Navy, headed right into Hurricane Florence’s wrath. As the storm headed toward land Thursday night into Friday morning, Fontenot and his group say, they helped to rescue more than 150 people, including terrified parents, their sleepy toddlers and scores of elderly trapped in attics, as water moved higher and higher inside their homes. “Man, last night was insane,” Fontenot said from the riverfront city of New Bern, N.C., where he was working alongside police and firefighters to save people from storm surge and flooding. Todd Terrell, head of the United Cajun Navy, said those who did not heed pleas to evacuate got trapped in their homes or tried to leave too late. He said rescuers used air mattresses to float people to safety because the storm’s gusts were toppling rescue boats. “A lot of people did not get out, tried to drive out, and a lot got stuck. So a lot of people we were rescuing from the tops of their vehicles,” Terrell said. “It’s real bad right now.” The Cajun Navy put out a widespread call for more boats Friday, warning authorities that people who were trapped in their homes in the historic inland town were “terrified.” As Hurricane Florence trudged west off the sea into the Carolinas, an armada of kayaks, fishing boats, shallow-draft duck hunting boats, airboats and pirogues moved north and east from Texas and Louisiana to meet the storm. As the rains and winds began to whip the coastline, the all-volunteer flotilla settled in. Bring it on, they said. The Cajun Navy has arrived. Just as they did last summer in Texas during Hurricane Harvey, a group of grass-roots, ragtag search-and-rescuers have moved into Florence’s path, hoping to offer their services to the flooded, the marooned, the injured. Credited with rescuing thousands of people and pets during Harvey’s unprecedented rains, they plan to do it all again, a vigilante crew trying to assist the government’s rescue efforts. What they saw in New Bern is expected in other areas throughout North Carolina and South Carolina in coming days as Florence moves along the coast and heads inland — some areas already saw massive storm surges and are amid downpours that could ultimately measure dozens of inches of rain. Wearing wraparound sunglasses, camouflage pants and tall mud boots, they streamed into Gaston, S.C., on Thursday to cheers and horn-honking. Some residents offered them gas cards and invited them to park their pickup trucks in their driveways or sleep inside their homes. The United Cajun Navy, as this group is known, saw the moment as bittersweet. “We aren’t here for a boat ride and a beer. We know this place is about to get hammered,” said Terrell, who is known as “Mr. Cajun Navy” and is a survivor of Hurricane Katrina. “We know we’re here because your house will be destroyed or your dog will be dead. And we’ll be looking for your loved ones.” During Harvey, their rescues were sometimes chaotic, and there wasn’t much — if any — coordination with federal and state authorities. Some gated communities refused to let them in. Others welcomed them as blue-collar superheroes with boats, since no one else seemed to be showing up. Cajun Navy leaders say they are working during Florence to coordinate more smoothly with local authorities and the U.S. Coast Guard when they can, but the storm is going to cover such a huge territory that they know the authorities won’t be able to handle everything. “When people need saving, we will focus on that,” Terrell said. Blair Burgess, who runs a social media company and lives near Gaston, a town outside Columbia, reached out to the Cajun Navy this week to invite them to come and help. He said he is a big fan. “Maybe folks think it’s just a bunch of rednecks in jon boats, but really, it’s a bunch of good ol’ boys willing to travel across the country to help their neighbors,” Burgess said. “When I asked them to come for Florence, they said, ‘We will be in town in 24 hours.’ And sure enough, they were.” A family friend loaned 180 acres of land so the Cajun Navy could set up a staging area there. “It’s not that local firefighters and police can’t get it done, but having the extra help means a lot,” Burgess said. “You can never have too many hands. You never want to be wishing you had 15 more boats to save 15 more lives.” For many volunteers, being a part of rescue teams has become a part of their identity and a way to cope with their own losses during catastrophic floods. Others have military experience and find volunteering cathartic. Volunteers say that when they are on the ground, they help anyone who is crying out for them, ferrying terrified people with toddlers off rooftops or pets through windows as the fetid water rises. Terrell lost his seafood business during Hurricane Katrina. “We just know exactly what the panic and suffering is like,” he said. “And it’s hard to just watch at home and do nothing.” Taylor Aucoin, a dispatcher with the Louisiana Cajun Navy in Baton Rouge, said that group already has rescued hundreds of horses and donkeys, and more than 100 German shepherds, getting them out of the way of Florence. Aucoin uses an app called Zello that allows her and her husband to radio in rescue requests to volunteer rescuers. Their do-it-yourself relief effort during Hurricane Harvey became a symbol of the self-reliant spirit in Texas. During Harvey, there were so many people who needed to be rescued that emergency lines were jammed, and people were posting desperate pleas for help on social media. The Coast Guard on Friday warned against using social media to send calls for help and urged people to call 911 — “if they can” — saying it is more efficient to seek assistance through official channels. Various local governments have considered trying to regulate the freewheeling rescue groups and mandate training, but so far the Cajun Navy largely has been allowed to do its work unimpeded. The Louisiana Cajun Navy’s Jordy Bloodsworth, 26, who drove 11 hours from his home in Baton Rouge, said it doesn’t matter to him where a call comes from. “I wasn’t going to come, but my boss actually gave me a few paid vacation days and said, ‘Go do your thing,’ ” said Bloodsworth, who arrived in Gaston with his 18-foot custom boat that sports a gator tail. By Thursday evening, his group was on the move to Lumberton, N.C., an inland area that is prone to flooding and is likely to see major rains this week. He brought plenty of packs of socks — “nothing worse than wet socks after a rescue” — some ice chests, boxes of granola bars and bottled water. Bloodsworth was 12 years old when Hurricane Katrina caused 14 feet of water to rush into his family’s home as levees failed. The family lost everything. He said he rescued dozens of people during Harvey. “I figure if I could save even one person it’s worth it,” Bloodsworth said. Fontenot, with America’s Cajun Navy, said he headed to New Bern this week from Sugar Land, Tex., hoping to get right into the middle of the storm — which he managed to do. “Nothing like the adrenaline of saving lives,” he said. “Best drug in the world. It’s what we do.”","Washington Post Cajun Navy races to the Carolinas; citizen rescuers pull people from rising waters Washington Post Working through the night on little sleep and lots of Mountain Dew and adrenaline, Taylor Fontenot, the Texas captain of an-all volunteer group …",2018-09-14T16:37:41Z,"{'id': 'the-washington-post', 'name': 'The Washington Post'}",Cajun Navy races to the Carolinas; citizen rescuers pull people from rising waters - Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/cajun-navy-races-to-the-carolinas-citizen-rescuers-pull-people-from-rising-waters/2018/09/14/46623928-b763-11e8-a2c5-3187f427e253_story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YkORWmPYxQwR4uV2QJ6JFOOvnDU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TQLVM7FYHMI6RJ5VVWVKLMVFP4.jpg,the-washington-post,The Washington Post,Hurricane Katrina,1
Seth Borenstein / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — With three strong hurricanes, wildfires, hail, flooding, tornadoes and drought, the United States tallied a record high bill last year for weather disasters: $306 billion. The U.S. had 16 disasters last year with damage exceeding a billion dollars, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. That ties 2011 for the number of billion-dollar disasters, but the total cost blew past the previous record of $215 billion in 2005. Costs are adjusted for inflation and NOAA keeps track of billion-dollar weather disasters going back to 1980. Three of the five most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history hit last year. Hurricane Harvey cost $125 billion, second only to 2005’s Katrina, while Maria cost $90 billion, ranking third, NOAA said. Irma was $50 billion, for the fifth most expensive hurricane. Western wildfires fanned by heat racked up $18 billion in damage, triple the previous U.S. wildfire record, according to NOAA. “While we have to be careful about knee-jerk cause-effect discussions, the National Academy of Science and recent peer-reviewed literature continue to show that some of today’s extremes have climate change fingerprints on them,” said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society. NOAA announced its figures at the society’s annual conference in Austin, Texas. The weather agency also said that 2017 was the third hottest year in U.S. records for the Lower 48 states with an annual temperature of 54.6 degrees (12.6 degrees Celsius) — 2.6 degrees warmer than the 20th century average. Only 2012 and 2016 were warmer. The five warmest years for the Lower 48 states have all happened since 2006. This was the third straight year that all 50 states had above average temperatures for the year. Five states — Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and New Mexico — had their warmest year ever. Temperature records go back to 1895.","Three strong hurricanes, wildfires, hail, flooding, tornadoes and drought",2018-01-08T17:04:18Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","U.S. Spent a Record $306 Billion on Natural Disasters in 2017, Government Confirms",http://time.com/5093043/natural-disasters-cost-us/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/hurricane-harvey-houston.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Hurricane Katrina,1

Terri Williams,"There were eight hurricanes during the 2018 hurricane season and ten during the 2017 hurricane season. These storms cause billions of dollars in damage each year. If a hurricane damages your home, should you rebuild on the same spot or move to another area? Its not a question with a simple yes or no answer. But we reached out to several experts to learn some of the factors that can help you make an informed decision.
Level of damage and insurance
A homeowners decision to rebuild after a hurricane will likely depend on how much damage they sustained to their property, and how much of that will be covered by their insurance policy, according to Peter Duncanson, Disaster Restoration Expert at ServiceMaster Restore.
 His company specializes in minimizing the impact of weather damage.
Once its safe to return and assess the situation, you should call your insurance agent and begin the claim filing process for any major damages as soon as possible. However, be cautious when entering your home for the first time after a hurricane. Duncanson recommends that you take several necessary safety precautions. And be sure to wear protective gear, as broken debris and standing water can pose serious health risks in your home, he says.
Another person with first-hand experience dealing with the aftermath of a hurricane is Robert Himmaugh, Manager at Acadian Windows and Siding
 in Kenner, LA. Catastrophe can hit your home in many ways, but here along the Gulf Coast, our number one threat is hurricanes, he says. Each year from June to November, we are faced with the possibility of being in the direct line of one of these storms.
Himmaugh also believes the two deciding factors are the extent of your homes damage and the insurance coverage you have. If you have a policy that includes temporary living expenses and replacement cost, then rebuilding might be the best option, he says. However, Himmaugh warns that rebuilding could actually turn into a full remodeling job. This is because most homeowners will want to upgrade instead of just replace lost items. If you do decide to rebuild, make sure to invest in hurricane windows, a laminated glass that holds together when hit with blunt force, he suggests.
Flood zones
Collect this ideaFlood insurance is not a part of your standard insurance policy. Image: orundongel/Getty Images
Your standard insurance policy may not cover everything, something that many homeowners dont know. Flood damage often requires a completely separate policy, and water damage can be one of the main reasons you have to rebuild, Himmaugh says. If your home has sustained significant water damage, he warns that it can lead to mold, rot and the complete deterioration of your home. In this case, its best to move on rather than take on the massive expense it will take to rebuild, Himmaugh says.
Chelsea Allard, VP of Design at Case Design in Charlotte, NC, agrees. She says that dealing with water damage after flooding requires special considerations. In some municipalities, its illegal to build in a flood zone. Or you can, but completely at your own risk as the property is uninsurable, Allard says.
She does not recommend rebuilding homes and infrastructure in coastal areas that are constantly being hit by hurricanes. The building standards should be much, much stricter in coastal communities. I believe that the practice of continuously building housing in vulnerable areas is immoral, Allard says.
Other factors
Nathan Outlaw is the President of Onvico
, a construction company in Thomasville, GA. However, his company frequently works in neighboring Florida. They are currently restoring several homes on the Gulf that were destroyed by the last hurricane. In the photo above, you can see where the company has started demolition on a home with water damage.
I think a flooded home is worth rebuilding, Outlaw says. Usually the flood damage will not be so great that repair costs are higher than the value of the home in good condition. He points out that since flooded homes tend to be close to rivers, ponds or the ocean, theyre often in desirable locations. This means they will continue to be somewhere that people want to live in the future.
Outlaws view is supported by Richard and Judith Woods, Owners of Albany Woodworks in Tickfaw, LA. In 2005, a New Orleans home that they owned flooded during Hurricane Katrina and they rebuilt it. And then, in 2016, their family home flooded during a freak rainstorm.
They agree that the extent of the damage and insurance considerations are important. But they also point out other factors. According to Richard, the most important question is this: Are you healthy enough to handle the stress of losing your home and the strain of navigating the tricky world of rebuilding post-disaster?
He says the 2016 flood took a huge toll on him emotionally. Even though he never considered not renovating the home, Richard believes its important for people to understand the reality. Rebuilding after a disaster is not the same as a project to transform your basement or design a trendy, new bathroom.
And if youre not in a state of mind to rebuild, Judith says it may be better to take the insurance money and move on. She also says homeowners should weigh the chances of another hurricane. They should also consider whether they can even get insurance if they rebuild in the same spot.
Additional tips
Collect this ideaGet the water out of your home as soon as possible. Image: Onur Dongel/Getty Images
Its often hard to think clearly in the aftermath of a hurricane. However, our experts say there are some things you need to do as soon as possible. It can be devastating and overwhelming to process the extent of the storms impact on your property, but remember to take pictures of any damage you see. Also, take detailed notes for your insurance claim and personal records, advises Duncanson. Once youve assessed the damage and salvaged what you can, flood damage restoration experts at companies like mine can help you make the necessary repairs and get you back up on your feet as quickly as possible.
Outlaw agrees that you should take immediate action to mitigate future damage. Homeowners should go ahead and get the water out, set up a dehumidifier and remove wet drywall and insulation, if possible, he says. Removing moisture and preventing mold will help keep future mitigation costs more reasonable.
He also recommends getting several quotes before any service is performed. A natural disaster has a tendency to bring out contractors who only want to take the money and run or who will overcharge clients for the work performed, Outlaw warns. Be sure to carefully go over any proposal and don’t give anyone money up front.","There were eight hurricanes during the 2018 hurricane season and ten during the 2017 hurricane season.

Associated Press,"BLADENBORO, N.C. – Major flooding remains in eastern North Carolina more than a week after Hurricane Florence made landfall. Gov. Roy Cooper said Saturday that nine of the state's river gauges are at major flood stage and four others are at moderate stage, while parts of Interstates 95 and 40 will remain underwater for another week or more. Emergency management officials said residents whose homes were damaged or destroyed will begin moving into hotel rooms next week. ""Hurricane Florence has deeply wounded our state, wounds that will not fade soon as the flood waters finally recede,"" Cooper said. South Carolina also has ordered more evacuations as rivers continue to rise in the aftermath of a storm that has claimed at least 43 lives since slamming into the coast more than a week ago. The small farming community of Nichols, South Carolina, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) from the coast, was completely inundated by water, Mayor Lawson Batter said Saturday. He called the situation ""worse than Matthew,"" the 2016 hurricane that destroyed almost 90 percent of the town's 261 homes. Battle said flooding from Florence has wiped out the 150 or so homes rebuilt afterward. ""It's just a mess,"" said Battle, who was awaiting a visit from Gov. Henry McMaster. ""We will try everything we can to come back... but we need to have federal and state help."" In Wilmington, where Hurricane Florence made landfall and which had been cut off by floodwaters, officials said they'd identified three safe routes into town. They encouraged people to avoid travel in areas where the risk of flooding remains. North Carolina Emergency Management Director Michael Sprayberry said Saturday that eastern counties continue to see major flooding, including areas along the Black, Lumber, Neuse and Cape Fear rivers. The Cape Fear river is expected to crest Sunday and remain at flood stage through early next week. He said residents who register with the Federal Emergency Management Agency can begin moving into hotels Monday. The program initially will be open to residents in nine counties, then will be expanded. A FEMA coordinator said about 69,000 people from North Carolina already have registered for assistance. North Carolina environmental officials said they're closely monitoring two sites where Florence's floodwaters have inundated coal ash sites. The National Weather Service confirmed Saturday that 10 tornadoes spawned by Hurricane Florence touched down Monday in Virginia, the strongest of which leveled a flooring company in Chesterfied and killed one worker. An economic research firm estimated that Hurricane Florence has caused around $44 billion in damage and lost output, which would make it one of the top 10 costliest U.S. hurricanes. The top disaster, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, cost $192.2 billion in today's dollars, while last year's Hurricane Harvey cost $133.5 billion Moody's Analytics estimates Florence has caused $40 billion in damage and $4 billion in lost economic output, though the company stressed that the estimate is preliminary and could go higher or lower. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster has estimated damage from the flood in his state at $1.2 billion. He asked congressional leaders to hurry federal aid. ___ Waggoner and Robertson reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

Jamie Ducharme and Arpita Aneja,"President Donald Trump on Thursday denounced a George Washington University study that attributed 2,975 deaths to Hurricane Maria, suggesting that the estimate — which is far higher than the 64 deaths initially reported — was politically motivated. In response, representatives from the GWU Milken Institute School of Public Health said they stand by their science, and “are confident that the number — 2,975 — is the most accurate and unbiased estimate of excess mortality to date.” But how can a death toll jump from 64 to nearly 3,000 ? The answer hinges on one fundamental question: What constitutes a disaster death? “You have to think of [64 and 3,000] as two different indicators,” says Carlos Santos-Burgoa, one of the GWU report’s authors and a professor of global health at the school. “The 64 comes from death certificates that have stated that the death is related to the hurricane,” such as those caused by drowning, falling buildings or projectile debris, Burgoa explains. Meanwhile, the number highlighted in the GWU report, which was based on an analysis of death certificates filed between September 2017 and February 2018, represents deaths “in excess of what would have been predicted if there had not been a hurricane, regardless of if a physician says it was related or not,” Burgoa says. This could include deaths caused by dangerous conditions encountered while evacuating, for example, or by disruptions to medical care stemming from widespread, lasting power outages in Puerto Rico, for example. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines say that these indirect deaths should be counted in disaster totals, but the GWU report found that “many physicians were not oriented in the appropriate certification protocol” and that “most physicians have no formal training in completing a death certificate and thus are not aware of appropriate death certification practices.” Add in challenges like impaired communications and transportation, which may affect normal reporting processes, and it’s easy to see how, by GWU’s estimates, some 2,911 deaths that should have been counted as storm-related were not. (After the storm, in October 2017, the CDC pushed out more detailed information about what qualifies as a disaster-related death and what does not.) An earlier study of Hurricane Maria deaths, published in July by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found an even wider margin of error. Harvard’s report, which was based on systematic household surveys throughout Puerto Rico, reached a “conservative” estimate of 4,645 storm-related deaths between September and December 2017, many as a result of “delayed or interrupted health care.” Household surveys are often used to estimate death counts when regular reporting channels are unavailable or nonexistent. This number may be higher than GWU’s, Burgoa says, because it used select households to extrapolate the total number of deaths. Burgoa likens the process to political polling, which can capture trends but may not be totally accurate. “When you do political campaigns, you do surveys. But at the end, there is a result,” he says. “We had the result because we had the total universal deaths.” These calculation complications are nothing new. Determining death counts after Hurricane Katrina, in 2005, was a similarly convoluted process. A study published in 2014, almost a full decade after the hurricane left huge swaths of New Orleans flooded and hospitals without power, attributed 1,170 deaths to Hurricane Katrina — 184 more than a widely cited 2008 study on the subject, thanks to new availability of autopsy data. Both of these numbers, however, were considerably lower than an initial estimate from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which initially cited the death toll at 1,833. Death tolls were much lower after Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast in 2012, but calculations vary there, too. The National Hurricane Center said at least 87 deaths were directly or indirectly caused by Hurricane Sandy, while the CDC, using Red Cross data, tallied 117 deaths tied to the storm. The CDC has strengthened its guidance around what counts as a disaster-related death in the years since Sandy and Katrina, but Burgoa says there’s still work to be done in clarifying and disseminating those policies. But more importantly, he says exact death counts are not the most meaningful piece of information to be gleaned from studying disasters. “Our goal is to provide a way to move forward, to get away from the controversy of numbers and move into, what can we do to protect and prevent [deaths] in the future?” Burgoa says. “That is what is important for public health: What are the needs of the population?”","Trump criticized a study that estimates the Hurricane Maria death toll at 3,000.

Mr. Garcia said he stayed in his home through the storm and he had to hold the sliding glass doors shut as the wind tore through. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Brock Long was frustrated.

""When we ask people at the local and state level to heed the warnings, dang it, do it! Get out!"" More than a week since Michael ravaged the Florida panhandle, officials say many people are still unaccounted for. Some could be buried under the crumbled homes they refused to leave. Experts who've studied the reasons people choose to evacuate or to stay put say while Long's frustration is understandable, the reality is often far more complicated. ""It's easy when you're on the outside,"" said Cara Cuite, a Rutgers University researcher who's studied the evacuation decisions people made during Hurricane Sandy. ""Of course it's, 'get out.' But when it's your life and your home, it's often a lot more challenging than that. It's not as simple and straightforward as it might seem."" Some of the reasons people decide not to evacuate can be easy to understand. Others are counter-intuitive. But experts say people's decisions are almost always rational ones, made after having considered the costs and benefits. Appreciating the full complexity of that calculus is important, experts said, if emergency managers hope to convince as many people as possible to get out of harm's way before it's too late. To do this, officials and researchers are finding new ways to encourage people to evacuate from helping residents visualize the potential storm surge, mobilizing more efficient transportation and better communicating resources available. Here are some reasons people don't evacuate, and how officials are trying to help: 1. Evacuating Is expensive For a family of four without nearby relatives, a seven-day evacuation including hotel, fuel, and food can cost upwards of $2,000, said Joshua Behr, whose research team at Virginia's Old Dominion University has surveyed thousands of people since 2011, when Hurricane Irene threatened the state's southeast coast. ""Many modest to low income households simply don't have the cash or credit,"" he said. ""When they return home they have difficulty paying the rent or mortgage."" Those with the fewest means often wait the longest to evacuate. By the time they do, the cheapest hotel rooms are gone, and the more expensive ones are even farther away. ""When you go through that cycle once or twice, you're more skeptical,"" Behr said. ""There's a sense of storm fatigue. You tend to wait and see."" 2. Staying can be lucrative Many people have told Behr's researchers that they saw hurricanes as an opportunity to boost their incomes. ""There's often an opportunity to make extra cash,"" Behr said. Some get a side-hustle, like clearing debris from people's yards. Others --especially those working in service and construction industries feel like they have no choice. ""Many folks are employed in auto repair, roofing, remodeling, siding,"" Behr said. ""And many employers told them, 'when this storm passes, I need you to work 16 to 18 hours, and if you leave and can't get back in, you'll be out of a job.' Those people stay."" 3. Anchors and tethers Pets. Concern for elderly neighbors or relatives. A medical regimen. Those are all reasons people decide to hunker down rather than evacuate. In these cases, policies and the messaging around them are important. ""Certain populations won't evacuate for fear of personal property,"" Behr said. ""For those households, messaging that informs them that protective services will be staged close to their properties may lessen their concerns. For those fearful of disruption to their medical regimen, letting them know there are medically friendly shelters."" 4. The fear factor The decision to evacuate is almost always tied to a person's perception of risk, and that perception is shaped by people's past experiences. People who've lived in storm-prone regions for a long time and experienced many near-misses may assume this next storm will be more of the same. In this case, said Rutgers' Cara Cuite, officials often look for new ways of communicating the severity of the danger. That can mean instilling fear, like by going door to door and asking people to write their Social Security numbers on their arms so search teams can identify their bodies. Researchers are also working to develop new storm classification systems based not just on wind speed but on what kind of threats people will face and how big the threats will be. ""A lot of people are creating visualizations on what six feet of storm surge looks like,"" Cuite said. ""It's going to be over the average person's head."" The Weather Channel featured one such visualization in the run-up to Hurricane Florence. A newscaster stood in front of a screen that showed cars and debris floating by in the flood waters. ""If you scare some people too much, they are paralyzed by fear,"" Cuite said. ""You have to pair the scary message with details on exactly what you need to do."" 5. No way out ""By and large, the vast majority of a population does have the ability to evacuate,"" said Brian Wolshon, who directs the Gulf Coast Center for Evacuation and Transportation Resiliency at Louisiana State University. But there are always people who can't even if they want to. In New Orleans, it was estimated that as many as 30 percent of residents didn't have the ability to evacuate themselves before Hurricane Katrina struck, Wolshon said. ""The hospitalized, elderly, economically disadvantaged, or prison populations,"" he said. A big challenge for these groups is often transportation. ""There's been a lot of effort to see how can we use more routing transportation services and gear them toward moving people who can't move themselves,"" Wolshon said. ""The problem is, from a practical perspective, there's very limited resources to be able to do that."" Not surprisingly, Wolshon said the regions that have suffered the most devastation are the ones that now have the best developed evacuation plans: New Orleans, Houston, South Florida. ""They've made the effort to make sure it doesn't happen again,"" he said. ""The problem is trying to convince everyone else that it could happen in your city.""","As rescues continue after Hurricane Michael, officials expressed frustration at people who didn't evacuate. But experts say people's decisions to stay are almost always carefully considered.",2018-10-18T19:45:51Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Why Stay During A Hurricane?

AP,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) A white man who spewed racial epithets before and after a shotgun attack on three black men amid the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans was sentenced Thursday to 10 years in federal prison.
Roland Bourgeois Jr., 56, sat quietly in a wheelchair as U.S. District Judge Mary Ann Vial Lemmon announced the sentence. He had pleaded guilty to two federal criminal counts in October, ending a years-long legal fight that was delayed numerous times amid questions about his mental and physical health. His sentencing resolved the last of the high-profile legal cases arising from violence that erupted at times in the city following the Aug. 29, 2005 storm.
The shooting happened roughly three days after Katrina hit the Louisiana and Mississippi Gulf Coast. Power was out, levee failures had flooded most of New Orleans and emergency resources were strained.
Bourgeois fired a shotgun at three black men who were trying to evacuate the area, wounding one seriously. Prosecutors said that he and others had discussed shooting black people and defending the Algiers Point neighborhood of New Orleans from outsiders after the storm. Before and after the shooting, his conversations were punctuated with racial epithets. And, his original indictment said, he told one African-American neighborhood resident: Anything coming up this street darker than a brown paper bag is getting shot.
Bourgeois was indicted in 2010.
Defense attorney Valerie Welz Jusselin argued for a sentence of five years in court Thursday. She noted Bourgeois frail health. And she said the confusion and fear that was rampant in the city contributed to his behavior. She said even trained police officers mistakenly believed that martial law was in effect and that they had license to shoot at will at suspected looters.
Federal prosecutor Mary Hahn dismissed that characterization of the circumstances. The men who were shot including one who was seriously wounded were headed for a ferry, hoping to evacuate the city, not looters. She also noted evidence of Bourgeois hate-filled statements and his waving around of a bloody cap belonging to one of the victims as though it were a trophy.
This was a premeditated attempt to kill, Hahn said.
Bourgeois was freed on bond at one point after his indictment but was jailed in August 2017 for a bond violation. Documents show that, at the time he was arrested for violating conditions of his release, U.S. Marshals recovered 10 rifles and seven handguns from the residence where he was living.
A trial was avoided last October when Bourgeois pleaded guilty to interference with rights and use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, according to a plea agreement. That agreement said his prison sentence would be at least five years and at most 10 years.
In addition to the Bourgeois matter, other cases arising from post-Katrina violence included the deadly shooting by police officers of unarmed civilians at the Danziger bridge in the days after the storm a case that led to eventual guilty pleas from several officers during a long and complicated court case.
In an unrelated post-Katrina case, five other officers were tried on charges related to the death of 31-year-old Henry Glover, who was fatally shot outside a strip mall before his body was burned. The officer who burned the body was the only one who stood convicted when the case was over. The officer who fatally shot Glover was convicted of manslaughter but was later acquitted by another jury after an appeals court awarded him a new trial.","Bourgeois, a white man, used racial epithets before and after the shooting.",2019-02-15T13:45:29Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Huffpost.com'}",Roland Bourgeois Jr. Gets 10-Year Sentence In Post-Katrina Shooting Of Black Men,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roland-bourgeois-hurricane-katrina-shooting_n_5c66bf08e4b05c889d1e4f33,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c66c24c360000790f6af9ef.jpeg?ops=1910_1000,,Huffpost.com,Hurricane Katrina,1
Alejandro de la Garza,"Hurricane Florence, once a Category 4 storm, was downgraded to Category 1 before it made landfall near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina early Friday morning. But experts say that despite the apparent demotion, Hurricane Florence still stands to be a destructive and deadly storm for those in its path. “Just because the wind speeds came down … please do not let your guard down,” Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Brock Long said at a press conference Thursday, during which he highlighted dangers like flooding from storm surge. “This is a very dangerous storm. Storm surge is why many of you have been placed under evacuation and we are asking citizens to please heed a warning. Your time is running out.” Indeed, Hurricane Florence’s rapid downgrade from a Category 4 to a Category 1 underscores what some say is a public safety issue with the way hurricanes are measured and discussed. Hurricanes are categorized using what’s called the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which takes only a single measurement into account: the speed of a hurricane’s sustained winds. A hurricane is considered Category 1 if it has sustained wind speeds of 74 miles per hour (mph) to 95 mph, Category 2 with speeds between 96 mph and 110 mph, and so on. But hurricanes like Florence bring dangers beyond high winds, most notably storm surge and flash flooding. “Florence is an excellent example of a storm that is a lower category than it was and yet is still extremely dangerous,” said Dr. Bill Lapenta, director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction at the National Weather Service, in an interview Thursday. “It was a Category 4 [Wednesday] and since then it’s a Category 2, which simply means its sustained winds have decreased. But when you look at the magnitude of the dangers that have been predicted, that hasn’t changed.” In the case of Hurricane Florence, one specific shortfall with the Saffir-Simpson scale is quickly becoming apparent: While it measures the wind speeds a hurricane is producing, it doesn’t take into account the speed at which a hurricane itself is moving. Those are often vastly different figures — while hurricanes can produce wind speeds of up to 150 mph and more (the average speed of an Indianapolis 500 race car), the storms themselves tend to prod along at speeds as slow as 5 or 10 mph, especially as they begin to hit land. A hurricane’s speed can determine how dangerous they are, as slower storms can dump biblical amounts of rain and create other hazards in a more limited area over longer periods of time. That, in turn, increases the risk for those in a hurricane’s path. “As Florence approaches the southeast coast, it might be moving only 4 miles per hour, which is the speed I walk,” said Lapenta. “That results in people being exposed to hurricane-force winds much longer than they would otherwise have been, and that in turn effects inland flooding.” Other threats, like storm surge, aren’t measured or predicted by a given hurricane’s category either. Any shortcomings with the Saffir-Simpson scale can have life and death consequences. Hurricane categories have become a convenient shorthand for residents, officials and the media looking to understand and convey the threat a storm presents. But a hurricane’s category alone often fails to adequately communicate that threat. That means people may be making ill-informed decisions about whether to evacuate their homes or ride out a hurricane and risk their lives in the process. And when hurricanes get downgraded right before making landfall, some people may wrongly interpret that as a sign of a lessened threat. “We really have to think about the different types of ways of explaining the risks,” says Dr. Tricia Wachtendorf, a sociology professor and the associate director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware. Part of the solution, she says, lies in presenting residents with a more detailed, multifaceted picture of the storm that they are about to face. “Having a classification system or a cone of uncertainty is one approach, but that has to be balanced with other information as well,” she says. Many meteorologists, officials and others have taken that advice to heart, especially after devastating storms like Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Harvey, and Hurricane Maria. In the lead-up to Hurricane Florence, newscasters and political leaders pounded home the idea that, even if Hurricane Florence gets downgraded, it’s still expected to be a disastrous event. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service is working on other ways to communicate a hurricane’s threat. One product, for instance, aims to predict where flash flooding may occur up to three days in advance, Lapenta says. The task facing forecasters and officials will continue to be providing residents with enough, but not too much, information leading up to a hurricane. “Part of the challenge is [balancing] the simplicity of the information when you talk about a category — and that can be really useful as you’re trying to convey information that’s as simple as possible — with the nuances and details that might be provided.” said Dr. Wachtendorf. In the case of Hurricane Florence, the warnings have certainly been straightforward. “My message is clear,” said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper at a press briefing Wednesday. “Disaster is at the doorstep and it’s coming in.” — With reporting from Jeffrey Kluger","Hurricane Florence was technically downgraded before it made landfall, but it's still a life-threatening hurricane.",2018-09-14T16:56:05Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Hurricane Florence Is Exposing Major Problems With How We Categorize Storms,http://time.com/5395912/hurricane-florence-category/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/hurricane-florence-scale.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Hurricane Katrina,1
Dave Mosher and Associated Press,"Hurricane Florence is headed for the East Coast of the US as a Category 4 storm. Hurricanes are storms that are so large they can easily be seen by astronauts in space, yet they are tricky-to-categorize weather events. Over the decades, one classification system has risen above the rest: The Saffir-Simpson scale. The Saffir-Simpson scale tries to assess a hurricane's intensity and is used to estimate potential property damage and coastal flooding caused by storm surge — an abnormal rise of water above the normal tide, generated by a storm pushing water ashore. Winds are a big driver of storm surge, however, so the scale is determined by wind speed. Flooding from storm surge depends on many factors, such as the storm's track, intensity, diameter, forward speed of the storm, and the characteristics of the coastline where it comes ashore or passes nearby. Category 1 Winds of 74-95 mph (120-150 kph). Storm surge of 4 to 5 feet (1 to 1.5 meters) above normal. Damage primarily to un-anchored mobile homes, shrubbery and trees. Some damage to poorly constructed signs and piers. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days. Category 2 Winds of 96-110 mph (155-175 kph). Storm surge 6 to 8 feet (1.8-2.4 meters) above normal. Some roof, door and window damage to buildings. Considerable damage to mobile homes, small watercraft, trees, poorly constructed signs and piers. Flooding of coastal and low-lying areas. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with outages that could last from several days to weeks. Category 3 Winds of 111-129 mph (180-210 kph). Storm surge 9 to 12 feet (3 to 4 meters) above normal. Some structural damage to small homes. Mobile homes destroyed and large trees blown down. Coastal flooding destroys smaller structures and floating debris damages larger structures. Terrain lower than 5 feet (1.5 meters) above sea level may flood as far as 8 miles (13 kilometers) inland. Hurricane Katrina, the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, was a Category 3 storm at landfall in 2005 after being a Category 5 in the Gulf of Mexico. At least 1,800 people died. Category 4 Winds of 130-156 mph (210-250 kph). Storm surge 13 to 18 feet (4-5 meters) above normal. Wall failures and roof collapses on small homes, and extensive damage to doors and windows. Complete destruction of some homes, especially mobile homes. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Major coastal flooding damage. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months. Two 2004 storms were Category 4: Hurricane Ivan, which made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama, and Hurricane Charley, which hit the Florida Gulf Coast near Fort Myers. Charley killed at least 21 people and left thousands homeless. The total U.S. damage was estimated to be near $15 billion. Category 5 Winds greater than 157 mph (250 kph). Storm surge greater than 18 feet (5 meters) above normal. Complete roof failure on many homes and industrial buildings. Smaller buildings and mobile homes blown over or completely blown away. Major damage to lower floors of all structures located less than 15 feet (4.5 meters) above sea level and within 500 yards (460 meters) of the shoreline. Massive evacuation of residential areas on low ground within 5 to 10 miles (8 to 16 kilometers) inland may be required. The last Category 5 storm to hit the United States was Hurricane Andrew in 1992. An estimated 250,000 were left homeless and the storm caused more than $20 billion in damage in the Bahamas, Florida and Louisiana. Fifty-five people were killed.

MAYA SALAM,"“Night Court” was nominated for 31 Emmys and won seven. John Larroquette, Markie Post, Richard Moll, Charles Robinson and Marsha Warfield starred alongside Mr. Anderson. Judge Harry Stone shared more than a first name with the actor who played him: Both the character and the man donned colorful ties, were magicians at heart and were superfans of the jazz great Mel Tormé, known as the Velvet Fog, who made several guest appearances on “Night Court.” Mr. Anderson was a eulogist at Mr. Tormé’s funeral in 1999. While he earned critical acclaim and amassed a devoted fan base on “Night Court,” Mr. Anderson never fancied himself an actor. “I’m a magician, or a performer, by nature, and that’s always what I’ve been,” Mr. Anderson told WGN-TV in Chicago in 2014. “I was never really an actor,” he said. “I was a magician who fell into a part on ‘Cheers.’” His role as the swindler Harry (the Hat) Gittes on “Cheers” — he appeared in six episodes, four in the first two seasons — led to his break on “Night Court” after he impressed the legendary television executive Brandon Tartikoff. Even Harry the Hat echoed Mr. Anderson’s real life. In 1985, he told People magazine that he used to run a classic street hustle, the shell game, in San Francisco, where, at 21 years old, he had his jaw broken by an opponent who was livid at the game’s outcome. Mr. Anderson, one of three children, was born on Oct. 14, 1952, in Newport, R.I., and spent much of his childhood on the move, often performing on the streets for money, he told People. By 16, he had lived in many cities including Chicago, New York, St. Louis and New Orleans. He landed in California at 16 years old and from there found success as a comic magician, which opened the door to his acting career. About his mother, he said to People: “She was a hustler, yeah. She did a lot of things. We moved around a lot, and she had a lot of men friends.” His childhood, though, was not bad, he said, adding that his dubious background should not be viewed any differently from his mother’s. “I respect my mother; she was very concerned with taking care of us,” he said. “She did what needed to be done to try to keep us together. People find my criminal days amusing, but they find her background shocking. I don’t draw any line.” Mr. Anderson told People that his father was a salesman who was mostly absent from his life, and that he had not seen him for 15 years before his death. Mr. Anderson is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Morgan, and two children from his first marriage, to Leslie Pollack: Eva Fay Anderson and Dashiell Anderson. Information about other survivors was not immediately available. Before “Night Court,” Mr. Anderson appeared on “Saturday Night Live” several times. He hosted the show at the height of his fame, in 1985. After “Night Court,” he played the newspaper columnist Dave Barry on the comedy “Dave’s World,” which ran on CBS from 1993 to 1997. In 2008, he appeared in an episode of “30 Rock” titled “The One With the Cast of ‘Night Court.’” In 2000, Mr. Anderson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to New Orleans, eager to return to his roots. They opened the nightclub Oswald’s Speakeasy, where he performed, as well as a magic and curiosity shop, Sideshow. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, though, tourism flagged and they were not able to keep their businesses alive. The Andersons discussed their decision with The New York Times in 2006, the year they moved to Asheville. “I had more people in my car last night,” Mr. Anderson said, a reference to the thin crowd at Oswald’s. He and his wife had also become captive to the depression that affected many in New Orleans at the time, Mr. Anderson said. Despite efforts to support their community — Mr. Anderson opened his club for what he called French Quarter Town Hall meetings — and maintain their businesses, they decided to call it quits. “I’m glad we tried to stay,” he said, “but I don’t want to be the person I will be if I stay here.” Continue reading the main story","As the zany Judge Harry Stone, Mr. Anderson spent nine seasons presiding over a fictional Manhattan courtroom and was nominated for three consecutive Emmys.",2018-04-17T04:18:56Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Harry Anderson, ‘Night Court’ Actor Who Bottled Magic On Screen and Off, Dies at 65",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/obituaries/harry-anderson-dead-night-court.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/17/arts/17xp-anderson1/17xp-anderson1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Katrina,1
Alan Taylor,"A year ago this weekend, Hurricane Harvey came ashore, roaring into Texas and Louisiana. Trapped between weather systems, Harvey sat in place over Southeast Texas for days, dumping trillions of gallons of rain, and spawning unprecedented flooding. Harvey set the record as the wettest tropical cyclone ever to hit the contiguous United States, and tied with Katrina as one of the costliest tropical cyclones in history. More than 75 people died in Texas, and billions of dollars in damages were incurred. Today, the Associated Press reports that “although many Texas families are still struggling to recover from Hurricane Harvey...daily life has mostly returned to normal in many of the hardest hit communities.” See also reporting from our own Elaina Plott, who spent time with the current and former Mayors of Houston, finding out why Hurricane Harvey Is Houston’s Unending Nightmare.","A year ago this weekend, Hurricane Harvey, one of the costliest tropical cyclones in history, roared into Texas and Louisiana.",2018-08-26T17:06:33Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",A Look Back at Hurricane Harvey: One Year Since Landfall,https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2018/08/a-look-back-at-hurricane-harvey-one-year-since-landfall/568594/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2018/08/a-look-back-at-hurricane-harvey-one/h01_RTX3DKSY-1/facebook.jpg?1535303194,,Theatlantic.com,Hurricane Katrina,1
Morgan Sung,"Kanye West has had a busy week. In the past few days, he's divided Twitter with his ""free thinking"" support for Donald Trump and other far-right personalities. When he tweeted a photo of his signed Make America Great Again hat, he reportedly lost some significant celebrity followers, including Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, and three of his Kardashian/Jenner sister-in-laws. SEE ALSO: Here's why the alt-right loves Kanye West On Wednesday, John Legend shared his thoughts on the Kanye/Trump drama in a thread of incredibly gracious subtweets. Here's part of that thread: ""I imagine there's some comfort in imagining a future without racism and projecting that onto the present. Thinking if we just deny the truth, it doesn't exist. If history is erased, we don't have to deal with its consequences. However, far too many people don't have the luxury of closing their eyes and ears. They feel it in their lives and can't act like what they see and know doesn't exist."" He ended it with this: ""artists can't be blind to the truth."" I love that great, brilliant artists have the power to imagine a better future. But artists can't be blind to the truth. — John Legend (@johnlegend) April 25, 2018 The defining trait of Trump's campaign and political profile was his embrace of white supremacy. He made it clear every time he spoke. Some serious cognitive dissonance to ignore that for the other x% you might find appealing. I guess I agree with &gt;1% of anyone's thoughts though — John Legend (@johnlegend) April 25, 2018 On Thursday, Kanye tweeted a screenshot of texts from John, where he asked the rapper to ""reconsider aligning yourself with Trump."" ""You're way too powerful and influential to endorse who he is and what he stands for... Don't let this be part of your legacy,"" John texted Kanye. Considering the criticism Kanye's received for the people he's endorsed, John's discussion with him is still pretty supportive. Unlike a certain Commander in Chief, Kanye took John's criticism well. Sort of. ""I love you John and I appreciate your thoughts,"" he responded before getting defensive. ""You bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought."" It didn't dissuade John from reminding Kanye to ""think with empathy and context"" as well. ""Your words and actions have consequences,"" he told Kanye. ""Much love."" He also made a point to promote his new single, since Kanye was posting screenshots anyway. Then Kanye tweeted that although he respects different opinions, he's still sticking to his own. I tweeted the John text to show that there are people around me that disagree with me and voice their opinion. I respect everyone's opinion but I stand my ground. — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 26, 2018 ""Im still the kid from the telethon,"" Kanye tweeted about 20 minutes later, referencing the infamous Red Cross fundraiser for victims of Hurricane Katrina when he ranted, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” on live television. I really appreciate this dialogue with John Legend because I'm actually very empathetic. Im still the kid from the telethon. I feel when people think of MAGA they don't think of empathy. — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 26, 2018 At least he used his platform to promote John's single. John Legend new single on line now 😂 — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 26, 2018 Twitter queen Chrissy Teigen, who's married to John, was annoyed that people tried to get a reaction from her. ""When it comes to people we know, we DO speak up,"" she complained. ""To THEM. not on Twitter."" Everyone keeps asking me to comment on shit. Comment on psycho Tami Lasagna, whom I refuse to give the joy to, say something about RHOA, speak up about kanye. When it comes to people we know, we DO speak up. To THEM. not on Twitter. And sometimes, I guess it makes it to Twitter. — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) April 26, 2018 But she did take the opportunity to ask Kim Kardashian if their dinner plans were still on. Their husbands' discussion didn't stop their plans, but Kim did have a suggestion: ""maybe no phones."" And Chrissy wrote off the Kanye/John dialogue as ""the most elaborate and complex google pixel phone ad."" She and John recently starred in an ad for the Pixel, and Kanye's green texts to John show that he's actually using it. The dialogue between Kanye and John is important because it shows that people with conflicting views can still have a productive conversation. But more importantly, it brings John's Pixel ad to light, where he finally accepts that he looks like Arthur. So there's your dose of Trump/Kanye drama for the day.","Kanye West has had a busy week.

Back Story “Was it really that bad?” That’s what Arthur Bicknell asked years after his play, a mystery farce called “Moose Murders,” opened and closed on the same night this month in 1983 — setting a punishing new standard for Broadway flops. Photo “Moose Murders,” a crime on stage. Credit Ruby Washington/The New York Times “The simple answer,” he conceded to The Times, “is yes.” Reviews were brutal. Brendan Gill of The New Yorker said it “would insult the intelligence of an audience consisting entirely of amoebas.” Dennis Cunningham of CBS advised, “If your name is Arthur Bicknell, change it.” (In one account, a woman leaving the theater shouted to a police officer, “Arrest this play!”) Here’s the Times review by Frank Rich, who years later would call it “the worst play I’ve ever seen on a Broadway stage.” In the years since its ill-fated debut, “Moose Murders” has gained notoriety, if not respect. In 2011, Mr. Bicknell published “ Moose Murdered : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love My Broadway Bomb.”) In fact, there have been revivals of “Moose Murders” around the world — and at least one comical twist. In 2007, the Repertory Philippines misidentified the author of the play in posters around Manila. Instead of Mr. Bicknell, it credited The Times’s critic, Mr. Rich.

Eliot L. Engel and Anders Fogh Rasmussen,"Rep. Eliot L. Engel, a New York Democrat, is ranking member of the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Anders Fogh Rasmussen is former NATO secretary general and former Prime Minister of Denmark. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. (CNN) This week, President Donald Trump will travel to the NATO summit in Brussels. America's allies will pay close attention to his every word and seek strong reassurances that the United States will continue to play a leading role in the critical alliance. We sincerely hope he provides those reassurances. NATO is not, as Trump has stated, taking advantage of the United States. The alliance was forged out of the ashes of two world wars under American leadership. Together, the allies honored those hundreds of thousands of service members who lost their lives by building a system to prevent such conflicts from igniting again. The relative peace and stability that NATO and other postwar institutions provided the United States and Europe in the late 20th century cannot be underestimated. With American leadership, allied democracies created the conditions for unparalleled prosperity for ordinary Americans and Europeans alike -- and defeated the communist threat. Today, that world is facing renewed danger, and our common challenges are no less significant. They include the growing Russian threat, transnational terrorism, cyberwarfare, piracy on the high seas and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, among others. Just as the United States underpinned NATO's resolve to provide collective security against the Soviet Union, an American retreat today will allow autocrats and dictators to advance. NATO is engaged around the world, supporting a range of interests critical to the United States and its partners. NATO allies continue to uphold the concept of collective defense -- an attack on one is an attack on all. This commitment was put into practice for the first and only time in NATO history after September 11, 2001, when NATO forces stood shoulder to shoulder in support of the United States. Even with the ever-expanding list of challenges, NATO has responded. Recent and ongoing NATO missions include bolstering defenses against Russia's aggressive posture along the alliance's eastern border; leading the 41-country-strong stabilization operation in Afghanistan; the counter-ISIS mission in Iraq and Syria; anti-terrorist activities in the Mediterranean Sea region; anti-piracy missions to secure vital shipping routes in the Gulf of Aden off the African coast, enhancing cybersecurity measures among allies; and supporting humanitarian and peacekeeping missions, which at one time included delivery of 189 tons of relief supplies for Americans affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. If the last 70 years of peace on the European continent show us anything, it's that the international political willpower and the joint military resources mustered by NATO are critical to global security. Yet NATO's continued ability to protect its member states and bolster global stability cannot be taken for granted. American leadership of a trans-Atlantic alliance is its greatest competitive advantage over rival powers, especially an autocratic Russia and a strengthening China. Going it alone in the world is a gravely misguided approach that risks the lives of Americans as well as Europeans and millions of others around the world. The United States has ensured its own security, in part, by embracing the pre-eminence of American and European shared values, including democracy, freedom, human rights, market-based economies and the rule of law around the world. No other alliance in the history of the globe has provided greater wealth, peace or freedom for its citizens. It must continue to do so. Like any other institution, NATO is not perfect. Most allies need to spend more on defense. Fortunately, as a trend, allied defense spending is rising. America is right to continue raising this issue, and Trump is certainly not the first President to demand that Europeans shoulder a greater share of the burden. But bringing all the allies onboard when it comes to budgets and strategy takes time, patience and careful diplomacy. It won't be accomplished by threats and bravado; in fact, such an approach will likely deliver the opposite outcome. We must remember that NATO allies' acceptance of American global leadership is not preordained. Indeed, America has gained substantially from the world order that it built and has fought to sustain for 70 years. Trump dismantles that system at America's peril, and that of its allies and partners around the world. We hope while in Brussels, Trump shows that America can lead the world rather than simply transacting with it on a short-term basis. As Winston Churchill wisely once said, ""There is at least one thing worse than fighting with allies -- and that is to fight without them."" Trump should take note. The world is facing too many threats for the United States to go it alone.","This week, President Donald Trump will travel to the NATO summit in Brussels.

Steven Melendez,"South Carolina will not be evacuating Ridgeland Correctional Institution, even though it’s in an area that could be hit by Hurricane Florence, the newspaper The State reports. The prison, home to almost 1,000 prisoners and up to 119 staff, was ordered to stay put even during an initial mandatory evacuation for surrounding Jasper County. That order has since been lifted as forecasts have refined. State officials have said the inmates are safer in the prison than they would be in an evacuation. Nearly 1,000 people incarcerated in South Carolina—and the staff who guard them—will not be evacuated for #HurricaneFlorence, despite Gov. Henry McMaster’s evacuation orders. It is unacceptable for a state to gamble with the lives of those in its care. https://t.co/bdLJAM7kR6 — Southern Poverty Law Center (@splcenter) September 11, 2018 By contrast, North Carolina has said it is evacuating hundreds of prisoners from prisons and county jails before the storm, the Charlotte Observer reports. Officials didn’t reveal exactly which institutions would be evacuated due to security concerns, but said evacuated prisoners would get a free phone call to notify loved ones. In Virginia, officials have evacuated one state prison, though local jails in the affected area are planning to keep inmates in place after stockpiling food and fuel, the Virginian-Pilot reports. Evacuating institutionalized people ahead of a storm is always a challenge, but failing to do so can prove deadly. Prisoners were kept at Orleans Parish Prison in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina despite a mandatory citywide evacuation, and many faced grueling conditions as the prison flooded with filthy water while food and water proved scarce or nonexistent. After the storm, the criminal justice system in the city was effectively shut down for months. Even once the prison was evacuated, many of its inmates spent months behind bars for minor crimes and traffic offenses while waiting for courts to reopen and hear their cases. And during last year’s Hurricane Irma, officials said 12 people died in Florida’s Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills after temperatures in the nursing home rose to 99 degrees.","State officials say the inmates and staff may be safer in the prison itself.

Fred Topel,"Brad Simpson and Nina Jacobson are executive producers on American Crime Story. After the captivating and award winning first season, The People Vs. O.J. Simpson, there were some hold-ups. The next season was supposed to be about Hurricane Katrina, followed by the Gianni Versace murder. The Assassination of Gianni Versace became the second season, but Hurricane Katrina is still up next. Then they are developing a season about the Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky sex scandals of President Bill Clinton. /Film spoke with Jacobson and Simpson at an FX party for the Television Critics Association. They described how each season has a different tone and therefore needs a different writer, and what we can expect from future seasons. Since Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski weren’t available, how did you find new writers to tackle Versace? Simpson: Ryan [Murphy] had Maureen [Orth]’s book and Nina and I had to think about who would be the perfect writer for this. It was tonally going to be different. O.J. was a drama. It had a sort of Sidney Lumet/Paddy Chayefsky inserted into it. This needed to be something out of the vein of Silence of the Lambs or David Fincher with a political bent. Tom Rob Smith is a writer we love. I tried to option his book, Child 44. When it came out, I lost the option battle for that. I think he’s one of the premier thriller writers as a novelist. We loved his series London Spy. He writes about all these things: Ripley-like characters, mysteries, people who are liars and also sexuality. It felt like his voice was the right voice for this. We knew we needed somebody who had as strong a reputation as Scott and Larry. He got the book and loved it and signed on instantly. Except for cowriting one episode, he’s written every episode of the season. Do you think you’ll have a different writer for each season? Simpson: I would love to stumble upon a writer who’d do a couple seasons with us. It’s tough because I love Scott and Larry. This wouldn’t have been a show that would’ve been right for them to write. Tom’s voice was perfect for this. It’d be easier for me if we could find somebody who would stay on, but somebody said earlier today, “We’re doing genres within genre.” True crime can mean many different things. If we did a kidnapping story, I guess we won’t because FX has their kidnapping story [ Trust ], but if we did a bank robbery story, we would probably find a very different type of writer. Jacobson: The truth is that Tom wrote some amazing scripts early on. So we had a lot of very strong scripts while we were still struggling with Katrina, so we had plenty to get started because he was on a tear. He knew exactly what he wanted. We had the usual dramaturgical process of the back and forth, but he was writing great material and had a lot of them. At a point we were like, “Very clearly, we should be doing this first. It’s ready and we’re not ready on Katrina.” Better to get it right and do justice to your stories than to try to hit a deadline. Even though you wish you could hit a deadline, you’d rather not screw it up. If Scott and Larry wouldn’t be right for Versace, how is the tone different from People Vs. O.J. Simpson ? Jacobson: It’s a different kind of story because of the fact that so many of the episodes cover different people. So you have all of the victims to explore. I don’t think people knew these people to begin with so they don’t have a lot of predetermined ideas because they didn’t know who these figures were. For me, I was impressed and surprised by what a cutting edge figure Versace was. I don’t think I realized that. You think of Versace clothes, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous kind of signifier of wealth. I didn’t realize what a visionary he was, how courageous his coming out was, the fact that he was really one of the first designers to come out. The others who had been forced out by having AIDS, all of that stuff really surprised me and the degree to which his work came from the inside, from his background and his history, his family, childhood. I really feel like I didn’t understand who he was until we dove into the research. How much did your take on Hurricane Katrina change? Simpson: Radically. The original Katrina was going to be an expansive disaster movie. We followed all the major characters: Ray Nagin, Kathleen Blanco, people on the streets, Superdome. It was unwieldy. We did a great first episode but then it was too much story to tell. Ryan said the story he always wanted to tell was the story of Memorial Hospital. So we seized on that. We’ve optioned Sheri Fink’s book [ Five Days At Memorial ]. We’re working with Scott Rudin and Sheri Fink and we’re telling a more contained story about these people who were trapped in a hospital during Katrina, and the murders that ended up being committed. People who started off there trying to save people ended up euthanizing them. Also, the ways in which the hospital was abandoned which is a metaphor for the way the city was abandoned. It’s going to be a medical thriller contained in a hospital with the hurricane outside, as opposed to what we were doing before. Jacobson: Our best episodes, when we had our big rambling Katrina, our best episodes were the Memorial ones. Now it’s about taking that, expanding it and trying to make sure that the story captures the bigger picture. When did you realize Memorial should be the focus? Jacobson: Well, we were going into pre-production and we were getting close to making Katrina. We already were well into Versace. We put the brakes on because we felt like it just wasn’t character based enough, it wasn’t intimate enough. We decided to put the brakes on first and then Ryan was like, “I have an idea. Our best episodes are the Memorial episodes. Why don’t we get the rights to the book and make it the whole season?” It was a very organic, smart decision because those were our best two and there’s so much more we couldn’t have told in just two episodes. If O.J. was Lumet/Chayefsky and Versace is a thriller, what genre would the Monica Lewinsky/Linda Tripp story be? Simpson: Monica Lewinsky is going to be in the vein of All the President’s Men. We’re glad we haven’t told it yet because what’s happened recently with Me Too and all the sexual harassment is really informing us in how we’re going to address it. That’ll hopefully be up after Katrina. Is that based on a book too? Simpson: Jeffrey Toobin’s book, A Vast Conspiracy. Like O.J. made Marcia Clark a sympathetic figure, are Monica and Linda misunderstood by history? Simpson: I think Monica is misunderstood by history. Linda Tripp I don’t think is, even though I think you get to find empathy in her. And Donatella [Versace]’s misunderstood. Ryan loves these misunderstood women. Jacobson: Definitely Monica is. Linda is complicated. I think that certainly she is a woman scorned, a person who was very proud of her job, proud of her influence, felt really discarded, but I also think she really betrayed and manipulated Monica. I think Monica is totally misunderstood, truly a victim of public shaming and bullying and slut shaming that is utterly unwarranted. But I also think you look now at the context of a conversation. It’s hard not to talk about abuse of power as well, given the larger picture that has emerged over the last few months. Do you have any ideas for what a fifth season of American Crime Story could be? Simpson: We have things percolating. We have them all in our head. We don’t want to announce them yet. We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves. Also, then if we don’t make them, everybody’s asking, “Whatever happened to that thing.” We’re also not announcing start dates anymore because we realize we have to meticulously fine tailor these shows and get them ready. They’re not programmers you can just churn out every nine months. I wish we could. Did you think you could at first? Simpson: O.J. took us a year and a half to write that. What we learned is with a new writer and new subject, you really have to put the time in and O.J. set a high bar. We didn’t expect to ever achieve what O.J. achieved which was this amazing universal acclaim, awards, ratings and everyone talking about it. We want each show to have integrity and exist and work on its own merits and bring something different to people. We’re never going to try to repeat O.J. That’s the reason this season is very different. If you’re showing up thinking it’s going to be O.J., you’re getting something very different this season. I hope it’s pleasurable. It’s scarier. It’s more intense but it’s also I think an important story. Cool Posts From Around the Web:","Brad Simpson and Nina Jacobson are executive producers on American Crime Story.

Kerra Bolton,"Kerra L. Bolton is the founder of Unmuted Consulting, a strategic political communications consultancy and online academy. She is also a freelance writer and former political reporter and analyst in North Carolina. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. (CNN) Purchasing a movie ticket has become the latest act of political resistance. The Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements, started and inspired by courageous black women, have ushered in cultural sea changes -- including challenging harmful and inaccurate media portrayals of African-Americans. The movie ""Black Panther"" has provided a rare opportunity to celebrate and savor the success of a story in which black characters' individual choices shape their collective destiny. ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" directed by Ava DuVernay, opens this weekend. The film is an adaptation of the 1962 book of the same name written by Madeleine L'Engle. A blend of science fiction, fantasy, and young adult coming-of-age narrative, it is the story of Meg Murry, an awkward and brilliant teenage girl, who adventures across space and time to rescue her scientist father, mysteriously gone missing. DuVernay's role as director brings a subtle strain of intersectionality woefully missing from much popular young adult fiction like ""The Hunger Games"" and the ""Twilight"" trilogy, in which white girls save the world. The diverse casting in ""A Wrinkle in Time"" also takes an important step in normalizing girls and women of color as heroines of our own stories, interested in math and science, and struggling to define ourselves in a world that doesn't always accept us for who we are. The movie presents a vision of female empowerment in which whiteness is no longer the standard. Unlike ""Black Panther,"" race is not central to the characterization or plot of ""A Wrinkle in Time."" L'Engle, who authored multiple young adult novels, was white. While her books touch on issues of equality in some ways, race is rarely an explicit theme. Race is present in this film adaptation because of DuVernay's decision to cast biracial actor Storm Reid as the movie's protagonist. Oprah Winfrey and Mindy Kaling are also cast as two of the fantasy creatures who help Meg and her brother seek their father's freedom. Representation matters, as Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change (a civil rights advocacy organization formed in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina) told me -- especially for children. By going to see films like ""Black Panther"" and ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" ""kids of color get to see themselves as heroes, centered in the story, and as the person to root for,"" Robinson said. It remains to be seen whether ""A Wrinkle in Time"" will experience anything like the same box-office success and emotional resonance with African-American audiences that ""Black Panther"" has had. Some prognosticators think it's unlikely, but it's possible. As teenagers, we often consume media to affirm we are not alone in our freakishness. We long to embark on heroic quests in which the very qualities society deems ""wrong"" about us -- a love of math and science for example -- become tools for positive transformation and change. This is what the book ""A Wrinkle in Time"" did for generations of white girls, and some black girls, who loved the book and now want to share the same sense of awe and recognition they felt when reading the book with their children and grandchildren. Black girls of a certain age who liked speculative fiction had limited choices when searching for inspiration. Some enjoyed L'Engle, and looked to other authors like Octavia Butler or Tananarive Due for inspiration because their novels featured characters who looked and sounded like them. For some black women, the ""Wrinkle in Time"" movie's appeal may be less about nostalgia and more about its director. DuVernay's bold directorial vision inspires us all. ""I absolutely love Ava DuVernay,"" said my friend Kimberly Simon as we discussed the importance of the success of giving black children positive role models on- and off-screen. Simon and her husband raised more than $300 to take 32 local foster children to see ""Black Panther,"" and will do the same for ""A Wrinkle in Time."" ""She is the first African-American woman given the budget (of more than $100 million) to do this,"" Simon said. ""Little girls can see her and say, 'I want to be a director.'"" Regardless of the reasons why we choose to see ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" it is important that we eradicate negative stereotypes of blacks in media. The media images we consume bleed into the public consciousness and seep into our education, housing, health care, and criminal justice systems. We may not be able to march every day. But we can vote at the polling place and with our dollars at the movie theater. The revolution will not only be televised, but it will come with a pair of 3-D glasses.","Movies like ""A Wrinkle in Time"" and heroes like Ava DuVernay can bring a revolution in black representation that comes with 3-D glasses, says Kerra Bolton.",2018-03-09T13:26:35Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Opinion: Watching 'A Wrinkle in Time' is a political act,https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/opinions/wrinkle-in-time-duvernay-black-panther-representation-bolton-opinion/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180306133551-a-wrinkle-in-time-kids-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Hurricane Katrina,1
Gina Martinez and Alix Langone,"The National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Florence – with winds of up to 140 mph – is expected to be “extremely dangerous” when it hits the East Coast early Friday. But, it’s the water, not the wind, that has the potential to make the storm so deadly, experts say. A storm as big as Hurricane Florence will hit with a “one-two punch” deluge of water, Erik Salna, the associate director of the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University, says. First comes the storm surge – a rise in sea levels caused by storm winds. Then come the torrents of rain. Hurricane Florence is currently a massive Category 4 hurricane. It’s gaining strength and could even be upgraded to Category 5 before it makes landfall early Friday, according to forecasts. Most of the deaths from hurricanes in recent years have come from people who stay put and get caught in the ensuing floods, retired Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Lennon tells TIME. Lennon, the chair of the Emergency Management and Homeland Security Department at Massachusetts Maritime Academy, says the biggest mistake during Hurricane Katrina – which claimed 1,833 lives – was that officials only ordered evacuations 24 hours before it hit New Orleans in 2005, and by then it was too late. “The bottom line if you wait, it’s too late,” he said. “If you have to make large scale evacuations, make the call early. The term mandatory evacuation rings hollow because there’s no good way to actually enforce it but if you call it something else people are not going to follow.” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster announced Monday that mandatory evacuations would begin at noon Tuesday for more than 1 million people on the South Carolina coast. The governors of North Carolina and Virginia have announced mandatory evacuations of hundreds of thousands more in their states. The National Hurricane Center says storm surge from Hurricane Florence could be up to 13 feet in some areas of North Carolina. Salna predicts it could rise as high as 15 feet. “It’s possible it could be even higher than that depending on how quickly the storm moves to the coast, but we’re kind of expecting it to slow down as it moves to the coast and would probably cut down the storm surge,” AccuWeather hurricane expert Dan Kottlowski says. “Nonetheless, there still would be a very life threatening storm surge of somewhere around 10 to 15 feet.” On Tuesday evening, the National Hurricane Center issues storm surge warnings for the areas around the Outer Banks in North Carolina and the South Santee River in South Carolina. Massive waves from the hurricane will make the rush of water even more dangerous and damaging, the National Hurricane Center warned. After the storm surge comes the deluge of rain. Up to three feet of rain could fall in some areas in a short period of time. Up to 15-25 inches is expected in many areas where Hurricane Florence hits. The National Hurricane Center says such massive rainfall could produce “catastrophic flash flooding and significant river flooding.” “Florence is going to drop tremendous amount of rain, not as much as [Hurricane] Harvey brought to Texas but there will almost definitely be flooding,” Salna says. The flooding will depend whether Florence slows down and lingers over coastal areas as it moves inland, Salna says. If this happens, the result will be heavy rains that cause serious damage.","“Florence is going to drop tremendous amount of rains, not as much as Harvey brought to Texas but there will almost definitely be flooding.” Salna said.",2018-09-11T22:26:58Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Why Hurricane Florence Is So Dangerous,http://time.com/5392883/why-hurricane-florence-so-dangerous/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/hurricane-florence-rainfall.gif,time,Time,Hurricane Katrina,1

The Maryland shooting was the third high-profile shooting in the US in two days and came just months after a gunman killed five people in an Annapolis newsroom. 2. Lake Victoria ferry wreck A ferry boat overturned yesterday in Lake Victoria in the northern part of Tanzania, killing at least 44 people. Rescue operations have resumed today, but there are complications. Ferries in Tanzania are often overcrowded, and the lack of an accurate passenger manifest makes it difficult to say how many people were on board -- and ID them. Local officials say there could have been anywhere from 400 to 500 people on the ferry when it tipped. If this tragedy sounds familiar, it's because there have been a few similar incidents recently, all sobering reminders of the dangers of overcrowded watercraft. It looks like Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in high school, may testify before a Senate panel after all. Her lawyers sent an email to the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday saying Ford ""would be prepared to testify next week,"" if senators offer her ""terms that are fair and which ensure her safety."" If you'll recall, there was supposed to be a hearing Monday regarding the allegations, but Ford's lawyers told the committee it would be unrealistic for her to testify so soon. The two sides are expected to continue talking details, including whether a potential witness to the alleged attack might testify and whether an outside counsel -- a woman -- would be brought in to question Ford to help the GOP overcome its lack of female senators on the committee. Families separated at the US-Mexico border are still being reunited, though the process is slow and incomplete. The US government says 34 more immigrant children have been reunited with their families since last week, but that still leaves more than 100 children in government custody. Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions this week made two quiet rulings to tighten control of immigration courts. One effectively makes it harder for immigration courts to be lenient with undocumented immigrants; the other may restrict the ability of immigrants awaiting asylum hearings to be let out of detention. The US hit China's military with sanctions yesterday for purchasing weapons from the Russian military, but the move was actually designed to punish the Russian government. The penalties were applied under a law that requires the US to sanction anyone undertaking significant transactions with certain people affiliated with Russian intelligence and military services, including arms manufacturers. According to US officials, this the first time anyone has been sanctioned for doing business with people on this blacklist.

Timothy Morton,"It was Friday, August 25, 2017, the day Hurricane Harvey began to hit the Gulf Coast. Somewhere in the middle of Houston, I was panic-buying lunch at a Whataburger, the Texas-based hamburger chain, for my two children, Simon (then 8) and Claire (13). It was like being about to get on a plane: a strange moment of misrule, like the days after Christmas, where you allow yourself to do childish, comforting things. It was a sign of things to come in the Morton household. A few days later, I looked out of the window and saw the street still underwater, the rivers four feet deep at either end, another kind of world turned upside down. I was bored, scared, and slightly ashamed of myself—too curious for the cabin fever, but too cautious to venture much farther than the rivers adjoining our street. I live in the Montrose area of Houston, right smack in the middle, and we had been told not to evacuate so as not to clog up the roads. I was waiting for the moment when I would try to get up on the roof and flag down the helicopter, using the little hacksaw and claw hammer I figured were the two tools most suited to that task. When it comes to how I handled Harvey, the best headline would have to be: “Eco-Philosopher Fails Hurricane Test, Crawls Under Rock.” But as I acclimated to the hurricane, it taught me something important about how people need to live with global warming. In addition to changing the way cities are planned, built, and managed, people need to learn to tolerate, and even embrace, the accidental situations they find themselves in as global warming’s effects become perpetual. In the hurricane, a visceral feeing lets loose, the feeling that you are never really living in a humans-only world. You’re on hurricane time. And the big problem with hurricane time is that it unleashes hurricane you. In my case, hurricane Tim (pun intended) was a jerk, which embarrassed me a lot. I got cross with friends for not checking in, until I realized: This is a whole world inside here, and unless you’ve been in one, you can’t really know. To a hammer everything looks like a nail. To a tick everything looks like it could be a juicy leg. To a hurricane everything looks like... what? We need to know the answer to that one, because we are going to be in them quite a lot more. Ecological thinking involves being aware that things are happening on all kinds of space and timescales at once. What looks great this week, like storing bread in a cupboard, looks terrible when you keep doing it for 12,500 years. Like for Dory in Finding Nemo, survival mode is assumed—“just keep swimming.” The trouble is, survive can come into very sharp conflict with live or thrive. No one at the start of the Neolithic period wanted to cause catastrophic global warming in the early 21st century—and neither do we who live in it today. But the extremely hierarchical and rigid societies that the actions of settling down, forming cities, storing grain, and spreading population created eventually resulted in just that outcome. Some of these scales are so big, in time and space terms, that all we can do, even with powerful helpers like computers, is report, observe, and endure. These actions hardly seem like actions at all: Often, they look suspiciously passive—and therefore disquieting. We should be in charge! In moments like this, people forget that trying to be in charge, to be “on top of” everything (a telling metaphor) might have been part of what got us into this global-warming thing in the first place. The trouble is, human civilization has inherited ideas about being active and passive, especially from theistic medieval philosophy. Passivity involves susceptibility, which risks sin and thus leans toward “evil.” Activity, meanwhile, is associated with divine creation, immortality, and closeness to God, and is therefore “good.” That’s a pretty strong contrast. But things might not be like that. If you’ve ever been in a band, you’ll know that doing something (in that case, playing the guitar or whatever) is made up of both playing and listening: being receptive or appreciative. “Active” and “passive” are blunt instruments for understanding what the climate is doing to humans, and what we can do in response. One of the great things about old vinyl records is that it’s such a drag to get up and move the needle to the track you like. You end up listening to all kinds of stuff you can’t easily skip over. That’s how things grow on you—and that’s a great image for what happens with the big, bad ecological phenomena we are starting to experience: Was that weird temperature shift caused by global warming? What about that storm? That’s what it was like in the hurricane. There it was, floating above our heads like the biggest, baddest LP ever—hurricanes are spirals too. On the third day there were five tornado warnings within an hour. From the safe little room in the middle of my old house, the tornadoes sounded like creamy-smooth, deep-white noise underneath the constant mid-range hissing of the rain. There was no way to skip the track. I’m here to report that, strangely, it did grow on us. Global-warming-scale events—hurricane time for example—are like those un-skippable tracks. Right now we pretty much just have to endure them. “Endure” here doesn’t clash with novel responses of geoengineering, like filling the ocean with some kind of algae or putting gigantic mirrors in space. It has to do with attending to things, getting the shape of them. That’s very different from the big-scale solutions that geoengineers are considering. Endurance is part of science—you have to wait and wait while the data piles up. And it’s also part of life—even hanging a picture means you have to feel out the texture of the wall. You can never get ecological planning just right. And if you try to get it totally right—if you try to get rid of all the anomalies at all—well, that’s what gave us civilization in the first place, all the post-Neolithic social structures that eventually required fossil fuels to keep going. Think about washing your hands with antibacterial soap. It’s going to work in the short term—but you’re forcing the bacteria to evolve into more efficient upgrades that will hurt you more. You can’t build the ecological city, but you can build an ecological one. There are all kinds of scales and I guarantee you that at some scale or another, those great technocratic solutions to ecological problems getting hardwired into cities will fail. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. In a way it means exactly the opposite. It means you shouldn’t stand around waiting for a machine that can reverse entropy and restore the climate to a prior state. When you start thinking ecologically, you realize that you can’t produce a one-size fits all solution to anything. During Harvey, some fared better than others. Not surprisingly, rich people got the better end of the bargain, even though some affluent areas were badly hit. On August 28, the Army Corps of Engineers opened the Addicks and Barker dams, which prevented a lot of flooding, but also profoundly affected people living in wealthier areas. Houstonians coped with hurricane time in surprising and hopeful ways. Two small examples clarify that hope: one from outside, one from within. First, the Cajun Navy. It’s a voluntary flotilla of people with boats, beer and music, who sailed around the city saving people’s lives. Volunteers formed the Cajun Navy during the disastrous government response to Hurricane Katrina. In many ways, New Orleans is the twin of Houston; perhaps it’s better to say it’s the cool, Goth younger sister of Houston, a sympathetic if slightly uncool older brother. After all, we share the same swamp (the gigantic Mississippi Delta), a fact that will only become more obvious as global warming takes hold. So it’s not surprising that Louisianans jumped in their boats to save Houstonians, who had provided lots of help during Katrina. Improvisation and mutual aid are where it’s at during changes that affect your entire city—your entire region, in fact. It’s worth remembering that Harvey’s impact zone was as wide as Western Europe and that the hurricane itself sat above Houston like a gigantic, invading UFO for several days. Hurricanes don’t understand state boundaries. Then there’s what happened on Wednesday, August 30. Wednesday was four or five days in. A few days later, a headline in the Houston Chronicle offered a “Hurricane Harvey Timeline for Those Who Don’t Know What Day It Is.” At that point, pretty much everyone seemed not to care that at some point humans had decided to measure time a certain way, a way involving weeks and days, for example. We so often confuse time with the measurement of time, the fingers of metal going around a metal disc or the numbers on the lock screen of a phone. But metal fingers and numbers on lock screens don’t mean anything to a hurricane. So deeply ingrained is our confusion about time that any displacement of it can feel weird, and a big one can feel downright trippy. That’s the point. We were finally on hurricane time, and it was like realizing that you’ve all been on the same dodgy drugs at a festival—for a couple of magical evenings, it seemed like everyone’s first thought about the other person at the pub wasn’t I think I know how you voted and now I’m not sure whether to talk to you at all. It was, Cool, you’re here—how can I be of assistance? It’s already a bit like that in Houston anyway. But hurricane time made it really like that. If that’s what to expect out of global warming—realizing that we are humankind and that one of our skills is having solidarity with one another—then I’m all for it.","An environmental philosopher reflects on his experience enduring Hurricane Harvey, and what it teaches cities and their citizens about living with global warming.",2018-07-08T12:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",The Hurricane in My Backyard,https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/07/the-hurricane-in-my-backyard/564554/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/07/RTX3PB00/facebook.jpg?1530899845,,Theatlantic.com,Hurricane Katrina,1
The Conversation,"We are all too familiar with images of flooding in low lying areas after heavy rainfall or houses destroyed by coastal erosion after a storm. For an increasing number of people, coastal flooding and erosion is a real threat to property, the local economy and, in some cases, life. Hurricane Florence, for example, is forcing more than a million people on the US East Coast to flee from their homes. Coasts support important industries (such as ports and tourism) and their populations are growing faster than inland areas. But coastal areas are also particularly sensitive to impacts of climate change, which are likely to increase the extent, intensity, and frequency of coastal flooding and erosion. So not only have we occupied areas that naturally flood and erode from time to time, we have changed the environment in ways that increase coastal flooding and erosion risk. And we continue to do so, sometimes with serious legal consequences. Meanwhile, public policies have not been very effective in managing this predicament. Traditional hard engineering approaches of coastal protection (such as groynes, revetments and seawalls ) are known to cause detrimental effects, which in the longer term can aggravate the problem they were supposed to solve. The impact of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans was a stark reminder that engineering structures are not effective against all events at all times. They are built based on trade-offs between the level of protection needed and the costs of construction and maintenance. Soft engineering, such as beach nourishment (where sediment, usually sand, is added to the shore), can offer a level of protection and beach amenity — but these reduce through time, as erosion continues. Meanwhile, ""protection"" gives a false sense of safety and enables occupation of risk areas, increasing the number of people and assets in risk areas. A serious conundrum A cyclist rides through flooded sidewalks in the wake of Hurricane Matthew in Charleston, South Carolina. Brian Blanco/Getty Images Climate change has forced a paradigm shift in the way coastal flooding and erosion risks are managed. In areas of lower risk, adaptation plans are being devised, often with provisions to make properties and infrastructure more resilient. Adaptation may involve requiring raised foundations in flood-prone areas or the installation of mitigating measures, such as sustainable drainage systems. Building codes may also be established to make structures more disaster-proof and to control the types of constructions within risk zones. But such adaptation options are often of limited use or unsuitable for high-risk areas. In such areas relocation is the only safe climate-proof response. Planning for relocation is problematic. There are large uncertainties concerning the predictions of climate change impacts — and this makes planning a difficult task. Uncertainty is not an easy concept to incorporate in planning and coastal management. In some places, effects of sea level rise are already evident, but it's still difficult to be sure how fast and how much it will rise. Similarly, there is still great uncertainty about when and where the next ""super storm"" will happen and how intense it will be. Inevitably, areas that have already been affected by flooding or erosion will be affected again — the question is when and how badly. Relocated Kiruna, the northernmost town in Sweden. Tsuguliev/Shutterstock Despite these issues, relocation is increasingly being adopted as a strategy. There have been some successes at the local level. One such example is the Twin Streams project in Auckland (New Zealand), where relocation (through the purchase of 81 properties ) has provided space to create community gardens and cycleways where 800,000 native vegetation plants were planted. This was made possible by engaging over 60,000 volunteer hours. Although not on the coast, the town of Kiruna in Sweden shows that, when risks are high, forward thinking and long-term planning can make large-scale relocation possible. Kiruna is at risk of ground collapse due to mining. Over a 20-year period, more than 18,000 residents will be relocated to a new city centre 3km away. The layout of the new city centre has been designed to be more sustainable, energy efficient and have better options for cultural activities and socializing. Local residents were engaged and helped identifying 21 heritage buildings they want relocated to the new area. The French, meanwhile, have instigated the first ever national strategy focused on relocation from high-risk areas. French policy places a duty on local authorities to develop plans by 2020, identifying the areas at serious risk of coastal flooding or erosion, what needs to be relocated and how (including sources of funding). Five pilot areas have been selected to test how the strategy might be implemented at the local level. Two of these areas have contrasting approaches and outcomes. In Lacanau (a top surfing stop in the Bay of Biscay) coastal erosion threatens the tourism-based economy. Although public opposition was initially high, the development of a local plan has generally been positive, mainly due to the inclusive community involvement in the project. A local committee was created to act as a consultation body and decisions were informed by open discussions based on clear communication of technical, legal, financial and sociological issues. In Ault (northern France) the experience was less positive. The risk reduction plan identified a high-risk zone within 70 metres of the cliff edge. It was decided that no new construction would be allowed here and restrictions to improvements on the existing 240 houses were imposed. This would force relocation if the properties were damaged by flooding or erosion. In May 2018 a residents group won a court case which considered the plan illegal, lifting the restrictions imposed on renovation of existing properties until a new plan is drafted. Engaging communities These examples demonstrate that engaging with local communities from the inception of any such project is essential. Unfortunately, people instinctively resist change — and relocation is a complete shift from the centuries-old approach of fixing coastlines and fighting against coastal dynamics. Our current legal and management frameworks are too geared up for maintaining the status quo. Funding and legal aid to support purchase of properties and removal of infrastructure that are not imminently deemed inhabitable are limited. But open and inclusive debate about the need for relocation and the consequences and benefits of it can change people's perceptions. The ""Nimby"" (not in my backyard) attitude is strong in coastal communities, but can subside after personal experiences of severe flooding or erosion. The environment around us is changing and we cannot continue living the way we did in the past. Prevention is always less costly and more effective than remediation, particularly when involving people's safety. The earlier we accept the need to change, the less damaged is the legacy we leave to the next generations.","Coastal flooding and erosion is a real threat to property, the local economy and, in some cases, life.

"USATODAY, Ledyard King, USATODAY","Hurricane Maria was the strongest when it made landfall in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico. Nearly six months later, more than 65% of residents there are still without power. Carrie Cochran, USA TODAY Network John V. Kelly, acting inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security (Photo: Ledyard King, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON — With FEMA facing its deepest scrutiny in more than a decade, the government watchdog in charge of measuring the agency's performance is no longer assessing its initial response to disasters. The decision by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General to no longer issue preliminary reports comes as the watchdog took the extraordinary step last week of pulling a dozen largely positive assessments of the Obama administration's initial response to several disasters. Acting DHS Inspector General John V. Kelly said the reports, pulled last week from the IG's web site, didn't meet proper standards for a government audit. ""We were not confident that the evidence collected (in those reports) was necessary to support the conclusion,"" Kelly said in an interview Thursday. ""It doesn't mean the conclusion was wrong (but) our standard is that it has to be adequately supported. You can't say something without having the evidence even if it's true."" The Federal Emergency Management Administration, or FEMA, is a division of the Department of Homeland Security. Instead of initial reports, the agency will adopt a model that provides ""real-time feedback"" to FEMA about its response to disasters based on observations on the ground rather than reviews that come out months after a recovery begins, Arlen Morales, a spokeswoman for the IG's office wrote in an email. ""This work does not lend itself well to a traditional audit following Government Auditing Standards. Nevertheless, the work is critically important,"" she wrote. ""By following standards that better suit the work, we can better accomplish the objective of the work— namely, to provide timely feedback to FEMA on issues before they become multi-million dollar problems."" The change means the watchdog won't be issuing a public assessment of FEMA's preliminary efforts to help Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria, a devastating, category 4 storm that left much of the island without power and other basic necessities for months. Nearly 200,000 families and businesses in Puerto Rico — 16% of the U.S. territory — remain without power. The island faces a growing mental health crisis as people wrestle with their losses from the storm. And FEMA is answering tough questions about bungled contracts in its recovery effort. Read More: FEMA teams in Puerto Rico: 'It's absolutely devastating' Read More: '5 months without power': Blackout is latest snag in Puerto Rico's long recovery from Hurricane Maria Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said the federal response to last year's hurricanes that hit Texas (Harvey) and Florida (Irma) was robust and immediate. The Trump administration's response to Maria ""was far slower and smaller,"" he said during a committee hearing Thursday examining federal efforts to help communities recover from last year's disasters. ""Even weeks after the storm, there were only a fraction of the federal personnel on the ground (compared to Texas and Florida),"" Thompson said. ""Food and water were in short supply, and federal contracts to provide essentials like tarps and meals were botched, further slowing the response."" Not since 2005 when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and killed nearly 2,000 along the Gulf Coast has FEMA been under such a public microscope. Those defending FEMA's response to Maria say the agency, already juggling several other major disasters last summer, had to respond to a remote area whose substandard infrastructure and government corruption severely complicated rescue and recovery. ""The bottom line is my agency made a herculean effort to put food and water in every area,"" FEMA Administrator Brock Long told the House committee Thursday. ""And it's not going to move as fast when you're talking about island jurisdiction and airport systems... and ports (that) are completely blown out."" Brock Long is administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Photo: Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY) Morales, the spokeswoman for the IG's office, said the new approach will work better than traditional audits. ""Our disaster deployment work was always meant to provide FEMA with real-time response,"" she said. ""We believe our new approach will improve our ability to do that."" Craig Fugate, who ran FEMA under President Obama from 2009 to 2017, said the new approach could be more beneficial than the after-the-fact ""punitive reports"" the IG often issues in the wake of a disaster. ""If they're moving to where (they give FEMA) a chance to address those (problems) as they see them, particularly in the disaster environments, that would be helpful,"" he said in an interview last week. But Claire Rubin, an independent disaster researcher and consultant, said not having initial reports means researchers and first responders won't be able to thoroughly measure FEMA's response to specific disasters. The recovery from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, for example, was enhanced by the lessons learned from Katrina, she said. ""We learn from history,"" said Rubin, who runs the Recovery Diva blog. ""Those of us who watch recovery know it's going to be decades for it to unfold. But as a service to the reading public, we need to document what actually happened, what caught them off guard, what they hadn't seen before, what they didn't handle well. We don't want to lose that."" The 12 reports removed from the IG's web site included two reports in 2013 on FEMA's response to Sandy.

It’s the bikes that bind. The Caramel Curves’ look conveys their playful interpretation of femininity, but the world of biking they have stepped into is usually associated with male figures. The violence of the Hells Angels depicted by Hunter S. Thompson, or the news-making brawls of the Bandidos or the Cossacks have defined what Americans think about bike gangs. Motorcycle gangs are sometimes synonymous with outlaw culture. There are exceptions, of course, of all-male motorcycle gangs who don’t participate in criminal behavior. Some clubs even encourage women to learn to ride, and others have a policy of promoting female ridership. But those public impressions of a kind of pulsing, sexist masculinity on the brink of losing control at any moment are not always incorrect. For example, women who associate with motorcycle gangs are sometimes called “property” — the implied possession of the male riders who brought them into the groups, according to the documentary on biker gangs called “Outcast Forever.” Female riders in coed clubs say that they face an uphill battle against prejudice, and that male bikers sometimes look down on the groups.

Credit Akasha Rabut for The New York Times In July 2005, a month before their city was devastated by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Smith and Ms. Beatty, along with a few other women, started riding together and named themselves the Caramel Curves. (The other women who started the group departed for various reasons.) “We called ourselves “caramel” because of the color of our skin, and “curves” because we’re curvy women, and we take curves on the bikes,” Ms. Smith said. Their start was quickly stalled when the members of the group — like so many residents here — were forced to move to other cities in the wake of the storm. As the city rebuilt, so did the group, and in 2006, Ms. Smith started calling women to ride together again as a way to heal. Even more women make up their social club — a support group that helps with their events. And around the world, they’ve captured a lot of other people’s interest: The Curves’ Instagram account now counts more than 14,000 followers. Kimberly Gilbert’s bike.

She describes herself using a motorcycle term as “the stunna of the group, because I’m always burning rubber, popping wheelies, doing tricks,” a claim backed up by the other members. She tags her social media posts with #burnoutqueen and #highheelsand2wheels. As for the group’s look, Ms. Smith puts it this way: “I’m always riding in cute clothes. And you wouldn’t want to be with someone looking fly and you looking regular, you know?” Shanika Beatty, who also goes by Tru, riding her motorcycle on Loyola Avenue in New Orleans. Credit Akasha Rabut for The New York Times Ms. Francis lives in Baton Rouge, an hour and a half west of New Orleans. She started riding years ago, on the back of a friend’s bike, but that wasn’t enough. “I was like, ‘No, I don’t want to ride on the back, I want to ride it.’” She bought herself a bike, joined a club and sported a pink mohawk helmet, but she soon found herself wishing she had women to ride around with. “I got tired of riding with the boys,” she said, adding that even though she was in coed groups, there were never any women. Then one day, on a Baton Rouge street, she spotted another woman on a motorcycle and waved for her to pull over. The rider was about to join the Caramel Curves. “I was enthused to see another girl riding a bike,” she said. A year later, Ms. Francis was a bona fide member. Today, she and Ms. Bell have plans to start a chapter of the group in Baton Rouge and are trying to pull together enough women through word of mouth in the city. ""Riding with women is just different,” she said. “A lot of guys are cocky and think that women want them because they ride bikes. When women ride together, we can talk about women problems — fashionwise, hairwise, just life- wise. And I’m just one of those women that’s like, ‘Anything a man can do, a woman can do better.’” Antonia Danielle, a.k.a. Sugah. Credit Akasha Rabut for The New York Times Rochelle Francis, a.k.a. Pretty Rocky. Credit Akasha Rabut for The New York Times So what does it take to become a member of the Caramel Curves? “Being a Caramel Curve is about being a woman and loving to ride a motorcycle,” Ms. Beatty said. “Even if you just had a thought that you may want to do it, come on, girl, you can do that.” (She would welcome women of any skin tone into the group, she said, because it would make the Curves “a truly diverse group.”) But that’s not all. Several women “prospect” — try out — for anywhere from 90 days to a year with the group. During that time, they must commit to several community service events, like fund-raisers to buy bicycles for young girls. They must prove their riding skills to the rest of the group over months of ride-alongs, both around town and out of state, to Florida or Texas, or to one of the most popular bike gatherings in the South: Black Bike Week at Myrtle Beach, S.C. They also have to complete an “obstacle ride,” which in New Orleans means a trip to a second-line parade, completing maneuvers like jumping sidewalks when the roads are blocked and dodging broken glass and rowdy crowds. Even if the prospects pass those tests, they’ve still got to have their own bike; the Curves’ bikes range from $6,000 to $22,000. Then there’s the question of safety. Ms. Beatty points out that a lot of women never get started riding because they are afraid of getting hurt. “People do fear for your safety,” Ms. Smith said with a laugh. “They always say, ‘Be careful, honey!’” Even once you’re a veteran rider, that risk remains, especially when you’re pulling stunts like the women of the Curves. Nellie Brooks, known as Quiet Storm, admits she rides a Can-Am Spyder — a three-wheel bike that looks like a Power Wheels dream for adults — because the design diminishes the chance of tipping over. (Asked why she’s called Quiet Storm, she responded: “Because I’m quiet,” and then said nothing else.) Caramel Curves members, from left: Nellie Brooks, a.k.a. Quiet Storm; Nakosha Smith, a.k.a. Coco; Kimberly Gilbert, a.k.a. Karma; and Andrea Shepherd, a.k.a. Hoodpriss. Credit Akasha Rabut for The New York Times And with biking, there’s always the possibility of showwomanship trumping safety. Ms. Bell was riding one day when a male biker shouted out to her, “I bet you can’t do any tricks!” She popped a perfect wheelie to prove him wrong. Filled with chutzpah, she pressed her luck and decided to pop another one. She recalled the story with a wry smile, revealing gold teeth. “I ended up hitting the gas just a little too hard, and I flipped backward.” She broke four ribs and dislocated a shoulder. The Curves have also been criticized for wearing heels — people say it’s dangerous to ride a bike in stilettos. But Ms. Smith reasons, “Think about how many men fall, and they don’t have heels.” From left, Kishyne Augustus, a.k.a. Honey; Rodshonda Turner, a.k.a. Mokahontas; Rhonda Edwards, a.k.a.

Credit Akasha Rabut for The New York Times The group’s swagger, though, hasn’t been met by delighted waves from everyone. A little over a year ago, a conflict arose over the fact that the Curves’ vests were emblazoned with “Caramel Curves MC.” Historically, “MC” referred to “Men’s Club” — a signal of the all-male origins of bike gangs. Over time, the initials came to be interpreted as “Motorcycle Club,” which is why the Curves decided to put it on their vests. Ms. Bell, who at 50 is the oldest member of the Curves, recounted what happened next: “I was at a club and a male rider came up and told me I needed to take off my vest, because I was a woman, so I couldn’t have MC on my vest.” She refused to remove the clothing, which bikers call “colors,” and a fight almost broke out. “My colors, I cherish them,” she said. “They’re a part of me.” Ms. Smith and Ms. Beatty burning rubber on Broad Street in the Mid-City neighborhood of New Orleans. Credit Akasha Rabut for The New York Times That don’t-mess-with-me attitude has protected the women. Butsome men who make up the bike community here say they respect the group for their riding skills. Michael Strong, known as 9 Millimeter, is one of the founding members of the Saints and Sinners, one of the oldest motorcycle clubs in New Orleans. He acknowledges that not all male bikers have welcomed the Curves to the scene. “They got a whole lot of men intimidated by them, because when they show up, they show out,” he said, referring to the women’s riding skills. “When they came along, they changed the game,” he said. “You had the hottest females riding the baddest bikes and doing the biggest stunts.” Ms. Beatty readily admits, “Everyone loves a woman on a bike.” She got started biking when she took her dad’s bike out for a spin one day. Instead of getting in trouble, he told her he was proud of her. She was hooked by the feeling riding gave her. “When I ride, I actually feel free,” she said. It’s that freedom the Caramel Curves are pursuing together. “I think in the motorcycle world, we’re still stuck in the ’50s,” she said. “And I think we’re breaking down barriers here within our own motorcycle community. We’re creating a legacy.” A version of this article appears in print on, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Cruising New Orleans in a Cloud of Pink, and Shoes to Match.

Susanna Heller,"A freshman at Prairie View A&amp;M University in Prairie View, Texas, was reportedly hospitalized after her roommate poured bleach in her eyes, according to WFAA. 
 According to the outlet, police responded to a dispute between Brianna Esomchukwu, 18, and Julisha Wyatt, 19, on March 8. Prairie View A&amp;M University Chief of Police Keith Jemison told the outlet that Esomchukwu then poured bleach into Wyatt's eyes. 
 The 19-year-old was transported to a local hospital, where her eyes were flushed and she was treated for ""minor burns,"" according to NBC-affiliated WKYC. 
 Speaking to WFAA, Wyatt's mother and aunt said that there had been some friction between the roommates — particularly since Wyatt complained to a resident advisor that their on-campus apartment smelled like marijuana, which they think contributed to the incident. 
 Following the March 8 incident, Esomchukwu was booked on a charge of aggravated assault, according to a Waller County Jail record reviewed by WFAA. A spokesperson for Prairie View A&amp;M University told the outlet that the 18-year-old's status as a student is currently being reviewed.

 Lenell Wyatt, the student's mother, said she was devastated when she heard what happened. 
 ""You never think that you're going to get a call saying your baby, your child, has had bleach thrown in her eyes,"" Wyatt told WFAA. 
 Wyatt moved her family to Garland, Texas, from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina decimated their community. 
 The college freshman has been released from the hospital and is doing OK, according to reports. Although she has had to dispose of a few items that were damaged with bleach — including her laptop, her mother said. 
 Wyatt is currently on spring break, but when she returns to school in a few days she is expected to move out of the apartment she shares with Esomchukwu.

BRIAN SEIBERT,"But for the piece to be effective, the extremely successful Ailey company, with its fancy headquarters and glamorous galas, has to create a credible sense of “there but for the grace of God go I.” If audiences are to feel that “it could happen to you” — as the work’s recorded text insists while the dancers point implicating fingers at viewers — then the strong Ailey dancers must be believably beaten down. That’s where the acting exercises come in. They weren’t part of the process for the first Ailey production in 1992, though it was greeted as a brave and welcome departure for the troupe. Along with the difficult subject matter, critics at the time noted the rawness of the aesthetic — the unbound hair, the absence of makeup, the emotional exposure. Ailey dancers past and present are also quick to characterize the work as “raw.” Danni Gee, a member of the first Ailey cast, remembered how she and her fellow dancers labored to “take the Ailey sheen off” and how they cried after every performance. That didn’t mean sacrificing Ailey projection and impact. On the wall of the childhood bedroom of Camille A. Brown, there was a photo of Toni Pierce in that first Ailey production of “Shelter,” leaping with legs split and toes pointed with nothing but air beneath her. “When I grow up, I want to be like that,” Ms. Brown remembered thinking. These days, Ms. Brown is a leading choreographer who has made work for the Ailey company.

Credit Jack Mitchell/Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation, Inc./Smithsonian Institution And these days Ms. Zollar is a revered dance matriarch, honored for lifetime achievement a t this year’s New York Dance and Performance Awards, also known as the Bessies. But in 1992, her company was young and no other troupe had yet danced any of her works. The invitation from Ailey was a huge break. “I was so intimidated,” Ms. Zollar recalled. “I just gave the steps, and I didn’t really know how to coach. It prompted me to figure out what the Urban Bush Women methodology is.” Now she has a method: “I call it an actor’s process through a dancer’s physicality with a community organizer’s analysis.” The actor games are a crucial part of the approach, she said. “That’s how we get to an authenticity, a truth, which is the most important thing for me.” At the rehearsal last week, it was easy to see what Ms. Zollar meant. Like anyone else, she was impressed by the Ailey dancers’ power. When Jacqueline Green marched with her long legs and flexed feet scything instantly to the level of her head, over and over, even the air seemed to rush out of her way. Ms. Zollar greeted the sight with incredulous awe. But she wanted to push the dancers past their comfort and control; firmly and warmly, she did. The fall-and-catch sequences, which are in the choreography as well as in the preparatory exercises, should not become rote, she said. The dancers must forget that the falls are coming. Even more important, she urged the dancers to use their own exhaustion, rather than hide it or “indicate” it. “I ask the dancers to go beyond their endurance,” she explained later. “We are exhausted by the forces that try to crush us, but we push through. The exhaustion is very important.” Photo From left, Jacqueline Green, Samantha Figgins and Ms. DeVore rehearsing “Shelter.” Credit Andrea Mohin/The New York Times The work is certainly demanding. Linda Celeste Sims, a member of the current cast and the kind of dancer who seems incapable of fatigue, said, “It seems simple at first, but I’m tired all the way through.” She continued, “You get exhausted from being exhausted.” For Robert Battle, Ailey’s artistic director and the person responsible for choosing the repertory, “Shelter” has taken on new meaning. “It’s hard to watch the news lately,” he said last week. “I watch and I feel afraid.” In this context, Ms. Zollar’s dance isn’t only about homelessness. “It’s about the shelters that are disappearing,” he explained. “There used to be an expectation that people could come together after a disaster or a mass shooting, but I feel less of that now.” By giving expression to this fear and a resistance to it, Mr. Battle says he hopes “Shelter” can provide audiences with “a shelter in the theater.” Over the years, Ms. Zollar has occasionally altered the dance. After Hurricane Katrina, she substituted a text to address that disaster. But the work doesn’t really require such updating, she said: homelessness seems as pervasive and intractable to her now as it did in 1988. Yet the current Ailey production finishes with a new poem listing the recent onslaught of hurricanes and raising the alarm about how climate change threatens shelter for everyone. In one sense, the production is returning to its original form. In the past, the Ailey company has cast the piece with men and women, but this time, it’s being performed by women only — a choice that pleased all the women interviewed for this article. “Especially with what we’re going through now,” Ms. Sims said, alluding as much to sexual harassment scandals and women speaking out as to homelessness and climate change, “it feels good for us women to come together as a powerful force. This is the right moment for ‘Shelter.’” A version of this article appears in print on November 29, 2017, on Page C5 of the New York edition with the headline: A Raw, Pointed Revival From Alvin Ailey.

"Emily Atkin, Emily Atkin","In this NOAA handout image, NOAA’s GOES-East satellite capture of Hurricane Harvey shows the storm making landfall shortly after 8 p.m. CDT on Aug. 25, 2017, on the mid-Texas coast. This story is republished from the New Republic via Climate Desk. The Federal Emergency Management Agency was already supporting 692 federally declared disasters when hurricane season started last year. Then came the most destructive disaster season in U.S. history, causing $265 billion in damage and forcing more than 1 million Americans from their homes. FEMA was overwhelmed. So the agency has a novel suggestion for Americans as the 2018 disaster season heats up: Don’t rely on us. In a report last week evaluating its response to last year’s disaster, FEMA details “how ill-prepared the agency was to manage a crisis outside the continental United States, like the one in Puerto Rico,” the New York Times reported. “And it urges communities in harm’s way not to count so heavily on FEMA in a future crisis.” “The work of emergency management does not belong just to FEMA,” the agency stated near the end of the report. “It is the responsibility of the whole community, federal, [state, local, tribal, and territorial governments], private sector partners, and private citizens to build collective capacity and prepare for the disasters we will inevitably face.” The sentiment echoes President Donald Trump’s own comments about Puerto Rico last year, following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria....Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017...want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017 Still, it’s probably good advice, because thousands of people who depended on FEMA for help last year are still struggling. They include 83-year-old Rosalea Nall, who lived in a hotel for eight months after her Texas home was flooded during Hurricane Harvey. Last week, she had to move back into her gutted house after FEMA stopped providing housing vouchers for Harvey victims. They also include the more than 1,700 Puerto Rican refugees of Hurricane Maria, currently living in hotels on the mainland, whose housing assistance is set to expire on Monday (and that would have expired on June 30 but for the grace of a federal judge). Meanwhile, approximately 1,000 households in Puerto Rico remain without electricity. FEMA acknowledged many of its failures in last week’s report—notably that it emptied emergency supplies from a Puerto Rico warehouse just days before Maria hit. (The supplies were sent to the U.S. Virgin Islands, then reeling from Hurricane Irma.) As USA Today put it, the agency admitted its planning “was incomplete, did not adequately account for the possibility of multiple major disasters in a short amount of time, and underestimated the impact of ‘insufficiently maintained infrastructure’ in Puerto Rico.” Extreme weather is getting more extreme, and until FEMA recognizes and acts on that reality, it will find itself overwhelmed indefinitely. But FEMA also argued that an effective response was near impossible given its resources. “FEMA entered the hurricane season with a [workforce] less than its target, resulting in staffing shortages across the incidents,” the report read. The agency has approximately 10,000 employees, but last year’s hurricanes and wildfires “collectively affected more than 47 million people—nearly 15 percent of the Nation’s population.” Nearly 5 million households registered for FEMA assistance in 2017—more than the previous 10 years combined, and more than all who registered for assistance from hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, and Superstorm Sandy, combined. The wildfires in California were their own behemoth, requiring more federal-response contracts than Hurricanes Harvey and Irma combined. FEMA’s response to Hurricane Maria was also “the longest sustained air mission of food and water delivery in FEMA history,” according to the report. Hurricane Irma was “one of the largest sheltering missions in U.S. history,” with 6.8 million people under evacuation order. Eighty percent of the households impacted by Hurricane Harvey did not have flood insurance, either, contributing to FEMA’s high costs. FEMA thus was only able to pay for less than 10 percent of the destruction. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria caused a combined $265 billion in damages, according to the report. Yet as of April 30, FEMA had only obligated $21.2 billion toward those damages. The agency offered several recommendations for improving FEMA’s capability for this year’s disaster season, which is already underway. It suggested, for example, “enhancements to the planning process” when collaborating with state and local governments before disasters. FEMA essentially echoed the message from its planning report in February: “The most important lesson from the challenging disasters of 2017 is that success is best delivered through a system that is Federally supported, state managed, and locally executed.” FEMA is certainly correct that disasters must be managed at all levels, but the most important lesson of the 2017 disaster season is that weather disasters are becoming more frequent and more damaging. The government’s failure to grapple with that reality contributed to FEMA’s poor response. For example, the 1988 Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act —the law that gave FEMA its authority to coordinate disaster-relief efforts—ensured that the agency could only rebuild Puerto Rico’s weak electricity system after it was wiped out by Maria; it was not allowed to spend money on rebuilding a more resilient electricity system. FEMA could have suggested a change in that law in its after-action report. And yet, just as the agency failed to mention climate change in its March report, it failed to do so in last week’s report. Extreme weather is getting more extreme, and until FEMA recognizes and acts on that reality, it will find itself overwhelmed indefinitely.",This story is republished from the New Republic via Climate Desk.,2018-07-19T16:21:54Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",FEMA Isn’t Ready for Hurricane Season to Start,https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/the-lessons-fema-refuses-to-learn-from-2017.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/b4a110fc-6aea-42cf-b0e2-53802f6201fa.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0,,Slate.com,Hurricane Katrina,1

""I think we did a fantastic job in Puerto Rico,"" Trump told reporters at the White House in response to a question about the new study of deaths. ""We're still helping Puerto Rico."" Trump's remarks were reminiscent of President George W. Bush’s much-criticized praise for then-FEMA director Michael Brown following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. ""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job,"" Bush said at the time. From September 2017 to February 2018, 2,975 people died because of Maria, according to a study released by George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health on Tuesday. That number represents a significant increase over the 64 deaths that had initially been counted by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello’s administration.

President Trump said that figures that attribute about 3,000 deaths to Hurricane Maria are a Democratic conspiracy to smear him and the federal government’s response to the storm. Trump had said earlier this week that the response to Hurricane Maria was an “incredible, unsung success” of his presidency. 3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much.

If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2018 The original official government death toll from the storm was 64 people, and Trump, during his visit to the island in October, cited low official death numbers in contrast to the more than 1,000 people that died due to Hurricane Katrina to show that Maria was not a “real catastrophe like Katrina.” But, even in the weeks and months following the storm, many experts thought the government figures were far too low because they only included deaths that could be directly attributed to the storm like collapsing buildings and drownings. In December 2017, the New York Times found that “in the 42 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Sept. 20 … 1,052 more people than usual died across the island.” Later analyses found similar results. A study by George Washington University, commissioned by Puerto Rico’s government and released in August, found that there had been 2,975 “excess deaths” in Puerto Rico between September 2017 and February 2018. The authors said the low official estimate was “because the conventions used for causal attribution only allowed for classification of deaths attributable directly to the storm, e.g., those caused by structural collapse, flying debris, floods and drownings.” This would not include people who died because they could not, for example, access routine or emergency medical care due to limited transportation or electricity following the storm, access they would have had if Maria had not so thoroughly battered the island’s infrastructure. The researchers said the number of deaths increased 22 percent in the six months following the storm compared with the expected level in that time period had the storm not hit. The researchers estimated that through October 2017—roughly six weeks following the hurricane, including when Trump had visited—there were 1,271 “excess deaths” in Puerto Rico compared with the expected level had there been no hurricane.

Amber Jamieson,"The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, slammed the White House for saying it was ""proud"" of its response to Hurricane Maria, as the official death toll was raised to nearly 3,000 people. ""Two thousand nine hundred and seventy-five dead. Is that what he's proud of?"" asked Carmen Yulín Cruz in an interview with CNN Wednesday morning. ""Is he proud of that maybe this is over and he thinks it will go away? It's not going to go away. We'll remember this forever,"" continued the mayor, who became an open critic of the Trump administration and the Puerto Rican government after the 2017 hurricane. On Tuesday, Puerto Rican authorities updated the official death toll from 64 to 2,975 people after months of denying that their initial count was incorrect. In a statement in response to the death toll increase, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: ""The president remains proud of all the work the federal family undertook to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico."" ""Shame on President Trump for not even once, not even yesterday just saying 'look, I grieve with the people of Puerto Rico'. Shame on him. He doesn't even take a time of the day to say 'look, I'm sorry that you people are grieving, I'm sorry that your people died',"" said Cruz. Trump had previously touted the relatively low death toll — it was officially 16 when Trump visited Puerto Rico nearly two weeks after the hurricane hit — as proof of how well the government had responded, saying Maria was not a ""real catastrophe"" like Hurricane Katrina. ""Now we have more deaths than Katrina and what comes out of the White House yesterday is simply 'we are very proud of what we did and we are committed.' The Trump administration killed the Puerto Rican with neglect,"" said Cruz. A BuzzFeed News analysis of data eventually released by Puerto Rico showed on the day Trump visited Puerto Rico, 550 more people had died than in those same two weeks the year before. ""This will be a stain in his presidency for as long as he lives. Because rather than coming here to support us, he came here to throw paper towels at us and we will never forget and we will always remember,"" said Cruz, referring to Trump's visit nearly two weeks after the hurricane struck when he threw rolls of paper towels into the crowd at a church where basic supplies were being given away. Hurricane season is underway, and Cruz said that Puerto Ricans are not prepared or ready for another hurricane ( despite officials claims ), but that small community centers in San Juan have opened with people taking first aid classes, they are also providing the use of solar electricity panels to help charge phones and refrigeration to store individual medical supplies such as insulin at the centers. But the mayor didn't just blame Trump for the response to Hurricane Maria. She also called out individuals within the Puerto Rican government, including Héctor Pesquera, who ran the island's emergency response and Governor Ricardo Rosselló. ""What I would like to see him do is fire the people that were in charge of that part,"" said Cruz.","""Rather than coming here to support us, he came here to throw paper towels at us and we will never forget and we will always remember"" View Entire Post ›",2018-08-29T19:17:36Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Buzzfeednews.com'}","The Mayor Of San Juan Asked If Trump Was Proud That 2,975 Died In Hurricane Maria",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amberjamieson/san-juan-mayor-hurricane-maria-death-toll,https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/29/11/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/the-mayor-of-san-juan-asked-if-trump-was-proud-th-2-28478-1535555934-0_dblbig.jpg,,Buzzfeednews.com,Hurricane Katrina,1
"Tallahassee Democrat, Jeffrey Schweers, Tallahassee Democrat","Florida Secretary of State Michael Ertel, then Seminole County Supervisor of Elections, wearing blackface at Halloween party in 2005.
 (Photo: Special to the Democrat)
TALLAHASSEE Michael Ertel, the newly appointed secretary of state of Gov. Ron DeSantis, has resigned after photos emerged of him posing as a Hurricane Katrina victim in blackface at a private Halloween party 14 years ago.
The photos obtained by the Tallahassee Democrat were shown to the governor's office on Thursday morning. Hours later it issued a statement. 
""The governor accepted Secretary Ertel's resignation,"" the governor's office said.
The photo was taken in 2005, eight months after Ertel was appointed Seminole County supervisor of elections and two months after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.
After the Democrat texted the photos to him last week, Ertel, 49, identified himself as the white man in blackface and red lipstick, wearing earrings and a New Orleans Saints bandanna, and falsies under a purple T-shirt that had ""Katrina Victim"" written on it. 
Over the phone and in person, Ertel would not comment on the record about the circumstances surrounding the photo. 
""There's nothing I can say,"" Ertel said.
The Democrat shared the photos Thursday with the governor's office, which had not previously seen them. 
DeSantis named Ertel on Dec. 28 to replace Ken Detzner, who served as former Gov. Rick Scotts secretary of state since 2012. 
The Secretary of State's Office is immersed in a debate about how to implement Amendment 4, which restored voting rights to some 1.4 million ex-felons. Desantis, who was against the amendment before the election, advised waiting to register them until the Legislature passed enacting legislation. Some counties, however, have begun the process.

 (Photo: Special to the Democrat)
Ertel said he sent an email to county elections supervisors to accept all applications from ex-felons.
The photos are the sole blemish on a seemingly spotless public career, highlighted by a record of increasing voter registration and making the elections office more accessible to the public.
Ertel began serving as supervisor of elections for Seminole County on Feb. 5, 2005, when Gov. Jeb Bush named him to replace Dennis Joyner, who stepped down for health reasons.
He ran against Democratic Party activist Marian Williams in 2006, beating her by 59 percentage points. He was subsequently re-elected without opposition. That same year he participated in monitoring the New Orleans mayoral election.
Ertel has a long record of expanding voting rights and registering people to vote. The city of Longwood gave him a Martin Luther King Jr. award for registering voters. In 2012, Ertel spoke out against Scotts purge of so-called noncitizens from the voter rolls, saying many of those who were purged were actually eligible voters.

Ertel also has won international awards for his plans to restore voter confidence and trust in the elections system.
Before his time in public office, Ertel worked in public relations, and was the first professional public affairs spokesman for Seminole County. After the 2004 hurricanes hit Florida, Ertel provided post-disaster media relations for Visit Florida.
Before that he spent eight years in the U.S. Army, providing public relations during the 1992 L.A. riots, and in Macedonia and Bosnia.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","The storm surge from Hurricane Michael has come ashore in Florida and is growing deeper. Waves are already gnawing away at the base of sand dunes at Panama City Beach. FEMA has nearly 3,000 people in the field ready to assist. (Oct. 10) AP Storm surge from Hurricane Michael will push into the smaller waterways around Panama City Beach, Fla., putting small docks underwater. (Photo: Craig Bailey, FLORIDA TODAY via USA TODAY NETWORK) Storm surge, the rising mound of water that builds up and comes ashore during a hurricane, will be a deadly threat as Hurricane Michael roars ashore along Florida's Gulf Coast. It's often the deadliest and most destructive threat from the storms and could be as high as 14 feet in some parts of the coast. According to the National Hurricane Center, the shape of this stretch of coastline makes it particularly vulnerable to storm surge. Water being forced on shore by the storm could get trapped in estuaries and rivers and pushed inland. A storm surge warning is in effect from the Okaloosa/Walton County line in Florida to Anclote River, Florida, the hurricane center said. This means that life-threatening storm surge inundation will occur in the warning area and be highest during landfall Wednesday. ""Storm surge is absolutely deadly,"" Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. ""Do not think you can survive it."" Storm surge has accounted for about half of the deaths in hurricanes since 1970, according to the hurricane center. It caused most of the 1,200 deaths in Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

The tidal cycle also affects storm surge, which is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm over and above the predicted astronomical tides. Storm tide is defined as the water level rise because of the combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide. Storm surge flooding does not include floods caused by the heavy rain from the hurricane, such as what happened in the Carolinas this year during Hurricane Florence and in Texas last year with Harvey. It also has nothing to do with tsunamis, large ocean waves generated by offshore earthquakes that are not related to weather.

Al Jazeera,"A giant hurricane, earthquake or other conflagration inflicting unprecedented, catastrophic damage is likely at some point to strike the United States. Warren Buffett says: Bring it on. In his annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Buffett said ""no company comes close"" to his conglomerate in its ability to financially withstand even a mega-catastrophe that causes $400bn of insurance losses. Buffett said the odds of such a catastrophe in any year is just two percent, but that Berkshire would lose only about $12bn, a sum more than offset by annual profits from its non-insurance businesses. ""Concurrently, much - indeed, perhaps most - of the p/c world would be out of business,"" he wrote, referring to property and casualty insurers. ""Our unparalleled financial strength explains why other p/c insurers come to Berkshire - and only Berkshire - when they, themselves, need to purchase huge reinsurance coverages for large payments they may have to make in the far future."" Berkshire entered insurance in 1967 when it paid $8.6m for reinsurer National Indemnity Co and an affiliate. The sector has since been the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's main driver of growth, even as Buffett expanded into railroads, chemicals, energy, industrial products, newspapers, candy and ice cream, underwear and other businesses. Berkshire's many insurance operations also include the GEICO car insurer and General Re reinsurer. Longtime insurance executive Ajit Jain has been in charge of overseeing coverage against giant or unusual risks. In January, Berkshire named Jain a vice chairman overseeing insurance operations, cementing his status as a possible successor to Buffett as Berkshire's chief executive. Last year was difficult for Berkshire in insurance underwriting, where it lost $3.24bn before taxes and $2.22bn after taxes, its first full-year loss since 2002. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as California wildfires, were key culprits, and the $3bn pretax cost for the hurricanes disappointed some analysts because of their size. Even GEICO lost $310m before taxes from underwriting, despite boosting premiums by 16 percent and policies-in-force by nine percent. Its underwriting loss was $188m in the fourth quarter. Berkshire had made money from underwriting even in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina struck the US Gulf Coast. That storm at the time caused $41.1bn of US insured losses, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Nonetheless, insurance helps fund Berkshire's growth by providing Buffett with float, or premiums collected before claims are paid, that he can invest. Float totalled $114.5bn at the end of December, and Buffett said it will ""probably increase slowly for at least a few years."" As he often does in his letters, Buffett praised his managers for keeping insurance growth on track, calling their work ""conservative and careful"" despite the occasional hiccup.

Nick Visser,"President Donald Trump wants to stop sending federal relief money to Puerto Rico, an American territory, following last year’s devastating Hurricane Maria, according to a report Sunday in Axios. Trump reportedly believes, without evidence, that the Puerto Rican government has been mishandling the relief funding and using it to pay off debt, according to the outlet’s Jonathan Swan. The president made that conclusion after misreading an article in The Wall Street Journal last month, Swan reports, and told Congressional leaders that he “doesn’t want to include additional Puerto Rico funding in further spending bills.” There is no evidence that the territory has not been using any of its relief funds to pay off debt obligations, and the island’s leadership has actually argued against doing so, according to The Washington Post. Trump first alluded to his frustrations with the relief funds last month, saying “inept politicians” were attempting to use the “ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding to pay off other obligations.” Puerto Rico is still recovering from the devastation left by Maria in late 2017. The island’s government revised death tolls from the storm up to 2,975 in August, numbers that Trump himself has denied multiple times on Twitter. More than $6 billion has been allocated to help aid storm recovery, but hundreds of thousands of people are still waiting for help, living in homes that are in desperate need of repair, according to The New York Times. The island’s leadership has said it needs billions more to rebuild, and in February said that it would cost at least $17 billion just to fix its beleaguered power grid. Swan reported Sunday that Trump has even proposed demanding some of the money already allocated to relief back. The president has regularly lashed out at the Puerto Rican government throughout the crisis, and even suggested that the storm’s impact wasn’t a “ real catastrophe ” like 2005′s Hurricane Katrina. After Trump’s latest attempts to downplay the death toll, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló lambasted the White House and said that the “victims and the people of Puerto Rico do not deserve to have their pain questioned.” “The people of Puerto Rico deserve a full accounting of the impact of the storm, and they deserve recognition of that impact by our president,” Rosselló wrote. “It is not time to deny what happened. It is time to make sure that it does not happen again.”",Axios reported that the president was even hoping to demand some of the relief money back.,2018-11-12T10:07:32Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",President Incorrectly Believes The Government Is Mishandling Funds,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-funding-puerto-rico_us_5be911fee4b0dbe871ac9c03,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5be9198f240000b603583371.jpeg?cache=YE6CzoPtCa&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,Hurricane Katrina,1
"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","You'll be mesmerized by this time-lapsed video of 2017's Atlantic hurricane paths. USA TODAY A view of flood waters from Hurricane Harvey near South Lake Houston Parkway on Aug. 28, 2017. (Photo: Henrietta Wildsmith, USA TODAY Network) The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season — by some measures the worst on record — officially comes to a merciful close Thursday after leaving a path of death and destruction in the U.S. and the Caribbean. Monster storms like Harvey, Irma and Maria killed dozens, perhaps hundreds of people and caused more than $206 billion in economic impact — a toll that will largely fall on individuals and the government to pay, according to one estimate from ENKI Operations. Those three names will certainly be retired by the National Hurricane Center due to their ferocity and impact in Texas, Florida, Dominica, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. If that $206 billion estimate holds, it would be the costliest hurricane season in U.S. history, even topping the disastrous 2005 season, which featured Katrina. Final cost estimates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — the official tally from the federal government — won't be available until early in 2018. Of the total, insurance covered roughly 30%, said disaster research scientist Chuck Watson of ENKI Operations. That figure is well within insurance companies' capacity to pay, meaning premiums are unlikely to skyrocket, he said. However, the remaining cost will be paid by individuals, who may have little or no insurance, and the government, in the form of loans or grants. Coupled with the disastrous wildfires in California, federal disaster relief money will have to come from somewhere and that could eventually mean changes in spending priorities or higher taxes, Watson said. The 2017 losses included $114 billion from Hurricane Harvey, $60 billion from Hurricane Irma and $32 billion from Hurricane Maria, according to ENKI Operations. The season was a shock to the system after several relatively quiet years for hurricanes. The prevailing weather pattern this year was quite a bit different from the past decade during the USA's major landfalling hurricane drought, according to Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach. ""The storms this year were forced further west by a pretty strong subtropical high that prevented recurvature"" out to sea, he said.. September was the true behemoth, the single most powerful month ever recorded in the Atlantic in terms of hurricane intensity. In a statistic known as ""Accumulated Cyclone Energy"" (ACE), Hurricanes Irma, Katia, Jose, Lee and Maria that month generated the largest amount of energy for any month on record, according to Klotzbach. ACE is calculated by adding each tropical storm or hurricane's wind speed through its life cycle. Long-lived, intense hurricanes have a high count (Irma's ACE measured 67.5), while short-lived, weak tropical storms have a lower values (Katia came in at 6.1), according to Weather.com. Both Irma and Maria soared to Category 5 strength, the top of the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity. Irma’s landfall on Barbuda and Maria's landfall on Dominica makes 2017 only the second season on record to feature two hurricanes that hit at Category 5 strength. Other records from the season included the 60.58 inches of rain that fell near Nederland, Texas, during Harvey. This broke the record for the greatest rainfall amount ever recorded in the Lower 48 from a single storm, WeatherBug reported. Meanwhile, Irma was the strongest storm on record in the Atlantic (excluding the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico) with maximum winds of 185 mph. And Maria was the worst natural disaster in Puerto Rico's history. The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was also the first season on record (since 1851) to have two Category 4 hurricanes make continental U.S. landfall in the same year (Harvey and Irma), according to Klotzbach. Though the official end of the season is Thursday, December tropical storms and hurricanes, while rare, do occasionally occur. Since records began in 1851, only six hurricanes have been recorded after Nov. 30, NOAA said. As for preseason forecasts, NOAA said 2017 would see 5 to 9 Atlantic hurricanes (10 formed) while Colorado State predicted six. Meteorologist Steve Bowen of global reinsurance firm Aon Benfield said that “regardless of where the final seasonal totals end up from a financial standpoint, 2017 will long be remembered as one of the costliest and most devastating hurricane seasons ever experienced in this country. The hope is that the season will provide many learned lessons to improve awareness and risk mitigation for when the next big storm arrives.” ""If 2017 taught us anything, it’s that the question is never 'if' the United States will endure a significant hurricane event; it’s 'when' and 'where' the landfall will occur and 'how' we will be prepared,"" Bowen said.

"Opinion columnist, Jason Sattler, Opinion columnist","DACA supporters protest in Washington on March 5, 2018. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP) Donald Trump’s immigration policies are having lethal consequences. Marco Antonio Muñoz, a Honduran man seeking asylum in Texas, committed suicide in his padded cell after Border Patrol agents separated him from his wife and 3-year-old son. Manuel Antonio Cano Pacheco was murdered in Zacatecas, Mexico, where he was deported after he was convicted of two misdemeanors and lost his protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. These are two tragedies arising from the Trump administration’s insistence on making America’s already cruel immigration policies even more intolerable by cracking down on refugees and people brought to this country as kids. How many more are there? Who knows? No one knows how many noncriminals will die in countries they’ve never known as their deportations skyrocket. We have no possible way to account for all the suffering that will be endured because Attorney General Jeff Sessions has decreed that refugees fleeing domestic violence or gang warfare are no longer eligible for asylum. More: Time's up.Get DACA done for DREAMers: John Kasich More: GOP opposition to DREAMers is irrational and ridiculous. What's their problem? And who can calculate the damage to children who are separated from their parents at the border due to the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy? All we can say is the effects of such toxic stress could be “ lifelong,” says Colleen Craft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Meanwhile, as Puerto Rico faces a new hurricane season, experts are still debating how many people died on the island during Hurricane Maria. The official estimate of 64 looks like a joke when studies put the number closer to 1,000, and a paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine identified “ 4,645 excess deaths.” Today, right now, Puerto Rico’s morgue is overflowing with hundreds of unclaimed bodies, and there is nothing resembling the national outrage we saw during the botched response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. What connects the Trump administration’s sadistic immigration efforts to its disastrous failings in Puerto Rico? Both speak to Donald Trump’s sickest success — normalizing the use of government power to dehumanize nonwhite bodies. If Trump’s mocking accent when saying the words ""Puerto Rico"" at Hispanic Heritage event didn’t convince you that he sees the island in terms of race, just look at how his administration’s hurricane responses favored Texas over Puerto Rico. This is actual “American carnage” and, unlike undocumented immigration and crime, which are near lows for this century, it will only get worse. We know this is just the beginning, because this is exactly what Trump promised he’d do as a candidate. Now he’s ripping children away from their parents, both literally and seriously. Trump’s career as a conservative politician began as a birther, but he didn’t become a real presidential contender until turned his venom on immigrants. His viciousness matched the GOP base, but it constantly exceeded what most mainstream conservative politicians were willing to act out in public. And while his slurs against immigrants and his tone made some queasy, his lust to demand papers from millions of undocumented Americans was completely in line with a Republican Party that has been voting to deport DACA recipients for years. More: Roseanne Barr just learned that no one gets to be Donald Trump. Not even her. POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Three years after Donald Trump came down the escalator at Trump Tower to tell a crowd of actors that immigrants who arrive through our Southern border are a particularly criminal group of people, we know what birtherism — the belief that only white Americans deserve the basic presumptions of citizenship — looks like as an official policy. It looks like screaming children, suicidal parents and overflowing morgues. Even worse, it looks like all-time high approval from the “pro-life” religious right that seems far more concerned with gay people being able to adopt kids than the prospect of “tent cities” rising to house migrant children who cross the border. This is Trumpism in action, and it’s fully endorsed by the GOP. Republicans in Congress haven’t taken up any legislation to try to rein in the administration on immigration and they’ve punted — again — even on voting on relief for DACA recipients. America’s right has made the decision to target the most vulnerable people in our society while bestowing billions on the richest and all sorts of favors on polluters, cable companies and banks. It’s a strategy that suggests an inability to empathize with the least among us. And it’s a strategy that has a body count. But who knows what the costs of a strategy like this will ultimately be? In her essay We Refugees, Hannah Arendt, a philosopher who fled Nazi Germany, concludes, “The comity of European peoples went to pieces when, and because, it allowed its weakest member to be excluded and persecuted.” Trump and the GOP are inviting these miseries in the name of party and nation.

"Opinion columnist, Alicia Shepard, Opinion columnist","In Coamo, Puerto Rico on Jan. 31, 2018. (Photo: Carlos Giusti, AP) When asked about President Trump’s reaction to ABC canceling the hit TV show Roseanne, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed the question as irrelevant. “I think we have a lot bigger things going on in the country right now,” she sniffed. But apparently, we didn’t. Both the media and the president considered it Big News when ABC swiftly canceled Rosanne Barr's show hours after she sent an offensive tweet about former Obama White House aide Valerie Jarrett. (Barr tweeted that if the “ muslim brotherhood &amp; planet of the apes had a baby=vj.”) What wasn't Big News? A Harvard study issued the same day estimating that roughly 4,600 Puerto Ricans died as a result of Hurricane Maria — 70 times higher than the official government death toll of 64 people. Researchers believe the number is conservative, and would be higher if they included people who lived alone and died from the storm. More: Trump's Amazon-Post-Bezos attacks are attacks on First Amendment More: Why conservatives rush to embrace crazy celebrities like Roseanne By comparison, 2,977 people were killed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and 1,833 died in Hurricane Katrina in 2005. And yet, one short indisputably racist tweet by a conspiracy-loving, Trump-supporting Hollywood celebrity turned the media on its head. Cable news spent over 8.5 hours discussing the Barr tweet and its implications. There is no doubt that's a worthy discussion, given that the country is clearly not post-racial despite having elected a black president. But the far more significant Harvard study was barely mentioned, according to a report by Media Matters, a liberal media watchdog. MSNBC and NBC gave the study 21 minutes versus three hours and 39 minutes devoted to Barr. CNN gave the updated death figures for Puerto Rico just under 10 minutes while Barr’s fiasco got four hours and 49 minutes. Fox News covered the Harvard study, which was reported in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, for 48 seconds. Not even a full minute. It devoted nearly two hours to Barr. Many newspapers, meanwhile, put the Roseanne story on the front page and tucked the Harvard study inside or, like USA TODAY, covered it online. More: My life as a writer for 'Roseanne' was great. Too bad her tweet blew it for cast and crew POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media The death toll in Puerto Rico, which just to be clear is part of the United States, was higher than every hurricane but one in recorded history. (Between 8,000 and 12,000 died in the Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900.) Puerto Rico deaths stemmed largely from a lack of medical care, water, food, shelter and electricity in the months after the September 2017 Category 4 hurricane hit. It came less than two weeks after the island of 3 million had been slammed by Hurricane Irma. The president, whom Sanders said had more important things to worry about, didn’t mention the updated death count. Nor did he condemn Barr’s racist tweet, or talk about the need for tolerance and respect. He was too preoccupied with the apology that Bob Iger (the chairman of Disney, which owns ABC) gave to Jarrett. He wondered why Iger didn’t apologize to him for "" HORRIBLE statements "" about him on ABC. ""Maybe I just didn’t get the call?” Trump tweeted. Coverage of the humanitarian disaster in Puerto Rico, which is far from over, has always been lacking. Even as Hurricane Maria struck the island, more media attention went to football players kneeling during the national anthem. From Trump on down, people don’t seem to be interested in the hurricane-devastated lives of Americans in Puerto Rico. Maybe it’s because almost half of us don’t even know that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. Or maybe it’s because Puerto Rico, while part of the U.S., is not contiguous to the continent. Or another factor that can’t be ignored is that Puerto Rico’s population is largely black and brown, which brings us back to racism. “Top journalists and government figures rarely mention race as a factor in understanding Trump’s negligent response to the hurricane or the U.S. presence in Puerto Rico more generally,” Frances Negrón-Muntaner, a Columbia University professor, wrote in The Root. “In other words: Puerto Rico’s crisis is not generally seen as a racial matter. But it should be.” The news media mirror society's interests in choosing which issues to cover and how much to cover them. Barr’s public implosion is worthy of coverage. But she shouldn’t matter more than real, entrenched societal injustices, like American citizens dying from lack of food, water or medical attention.

(Photo: Alan Campbell, Rocky Mount Telegram via AP) A high definition camera outside of the International Space Station captures the massive size of Hurricane Florence over the Atlantic Ocean. (Sept. 12) AP WASHINGTON – Hurricane Florence is more than just the latest disaster confronting FEMA. It's a chance at redemption for an agency widely criticized for its response to Hurricane Maria when it struck Puerto Rico nearly a year ago. Florence, the menacing storm rumbling toward the East Coast, has been described by FEMA Associate Administrator Jeff Byard as ""a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina Coast.” Record storm surges have been forecast. Massive damage to homes and infrastructure is expected. Devastating inland flooding is predicted. Power could be out for weeks. If federal responders were looking to show they can handle the worst, Florence is shaping up as a formidable test. Which also means that a successful recovery could help restore a bit of FEMA's luster as it struggles to emerge from the shadow of Maria which led to the deaths of nearly 3,000 people. But the task has been complicated by President Donald Trump’s recent praise for his administration's response to Maria – drawing attention to what's seen as a dark chapter for the agency rather than focusing on the robust response it's assembling for Florence. The position in which the agency finds itself now is not unlike a decade ago, when its reputation was tarnished by Hurricane Katrina, said Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator under President Barack Obama. Fugate came on board more than three years after Katrina, but the shadow of criticism from the agency's response to that devastating storm still loomed years after his arrival. ""I cannot change what people think,"" Fugate told USA TODAY. ""I cannot go back and change what happened in Katrina, just like (current FEMA chief) Brock (Long) cannot go back and change what happened in Maria."" ""But the agency's got to focus on the disasters in front of them, and we constantly improve and get better and then get challenged in ways we never expected. When we fall down, we have to get up and go again."" Long and other FEMA officials have avoided dwelling on Maria, or making comparisons with Florence. Trump has not been so shy. His claim Thursday morning that Maria's death toll was severely inflated by political opponents – which followed an earlier claim that his administration's response in Puerto Rico was an ""unsung success"" – infuriated critics on the island and beyond, who say FEMA should have done more to save lives. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz on Thursday called the president ""delusional, paranoid, and unhinged from any sense of reality."" Success? Federal response according to Trump in Puerto Rico a success? If he thinks the death of 3,000 people os a success God help us all. — Carmen Yulín Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) September 11, 2018 Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, lamented that the deaths had become political. ""Both Fed &amp; local gov made mistakes,"" Rubio tweeted. ""We all need to stop the blame game &amp; focus on recovery, helping those still hurting &amp; fixing the mistakes."" These days even tragedy becomes political. 3k more Americans died in #PuertoRico after Hurricane than during comparable periods before. Both Fed &amp; local gov made mistakes. We all need to stop the blame game &amp; focus on recovery, helping those still hurting &amp; fixing the mistakes. https://t.co/NQRKWbWEdh — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) September 13, 2018 Florence's full impact won't be known for several days. But hurricane experts say FEMA is better poised to deal with the approaching storm than it was for Maria, for several reasons: • The agency isn't preoccupied with other catastrophic storms. When Maria hit Puerto Rico last year, it the third major hurricane to strike U.S. territory in less than a month. FEMA officials acknowledge they were short-staffed for Maria, in part because they were managing response and recovery for Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida. While the agency is dealing with several smaller emergencies around the country right now, it can provide a robust response to Florence. • The Carolinas don't present the logistical challenge an island like Puerto Rico did. People, supplies and equipment can be delivered by road, not just air and sea. That should make recovery much easier, cutting down on the potential loss of life and improving the ability to restore power. FEMA officials predict some places in the Carolinas could be without power for weeks, but it took months to get most of Puerto Rico back on line. In addition, the presence of large military bases, especially Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, North Carolina, near the South Carolina border, that can be converted into distribution centers and staging areas should make the job of emergency responders much smoother. President Donald Trump tours a neighborhood damaged in Hurricane Maria Oct. 3, 2017, in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) • North Carolina, in particular, has a well-respected and seasoned emergency management team in place. Mike Sprayberry, who heads the North Carolina Emergency Management office, is the current president of the national association of emergency managers. Fugate called Sprayberry's crew ""one of the top in the nation."" FEMA's role is to help states lead disaster response and recovery – not to lead the effort itself. The agency shouldered a much larger share of the work during Maria than usual because Puerto Rico's effort was hobbled by the island's failing communication system and transportation network. • FEMA has had the opportunity to learn from the lessons of Maria. In a report issued in July, FEMA acknowledged staffing shortages and logistical challenges in responding to Maria. ""FEMA began incorporating lessons in real time as they were identified and continues to do so to prepare for the 2018 hurricane season,"" Long wrote in a column last month for USA TODAY. ""We have substantially increased stockpiles of resources across the nation, focusing on remote, hard-to-reach locations."" Sand bags surround homes on North Topsail Beach, N.C., Wednesday, Sept. 12, 2018, as Hurricane Florence threatens the coast. (Photo: Chuck Burton, AP) Retired Army Col. Paul B. Olsen, a hurricane expert at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, said every disaster response can have its negative moments. The important factor is how FEMA evolves from one response and recovery to the next. ""You gather best practices and lessons learned and you make sure that when you execute it the next time, it's even better,"" said Olsen, who commanded the Norfolk District for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. ""You don't grade yourself on your last hurricane. You grade yourself on how well you are prepared for the next one."" FEMA will have to overcome some challenges. It's not fully staffed, including in its leadership ranks. Only one of three deputy administrator positions, for example, has a confirmed appointee in place, Virginia Tech disaster recovery expert Patrick Roberts wrote on his web site. “Appointees are important for bridging the gap between career staff and the political priorities of the White House,"" he said. The Government Accountability Office reported last week that 54 percent of FEMA workers last October, at the height of deployments, were serving in a job they were not ""qualified"" to hold. ""FEMA officials noted that staff shortages, and lack of trained personnel with program expertise led to complications in its response efforts, particularly after Hurricane Maria,"" the GAO concluded. Long downplayed the significance of that finding. He told MSNBC this week that it's ""being taken way out of context"" because its definitions of ""qualified"" were overly strict. Congressional Democrats criticized the Trump administration this week after learning it transferred nearly $10 million from FEMA's budget this summer to help boost U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Byard, the FEMA associate administrator, said Wednesday there's ""plenty of resources"" to respond to Florence. He pointed to the federal Disaster Relief Fund, which has more than $26 billion. Long vigorously defended FEMA's response to Maria. ""We kept Puerto Rico from total collapse as a result of Maria,"" he told MSNBC. ""Any time that FEMA goes into an event and we're the first responder – and only responder for many months, that's not a desirable situation."" A robust and successful response to and recovery from Florence is crucial, said Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas. But ""It won’t erase the lives that are lost,"" she said.

Alexander Mallin,"A new study commissioned by Puerto Rico 's government estimates that 2,975 people died in the months following Hurricane Maria's landfall in September of 2017. Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The findings call attention again to past comments made by President Trump, who commended his administration's response to Maria. According to the study from George Washington University's Milken School of Public Health, the island saw a significant increase in deaths compared to mortality patterns from 2010-2017. The official government death toll attributed to Hurricane Maria currently stands at 64, according to the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety. Trump visited the island weeks after the hurricane hit and praised officials who said at the time that only 16 people had died from the storm. ""If you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering -- nobody has ever seen anything like this,"" Trump said. ""Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud. Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what's taken place in Puerto Rico."" Two weeks later, Trump was asked in the Oval Office how he would rate the administration's response to the storm on a scale of 1 to 10. ""I’d say it was a 10,"" Trump said. ""I’d say it was probably the most difficult when you talk about relief, when you talk about search, when you talk about all of the different levels, and even when you talk about lives saved."" Earlier this summer, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was pressed if the president still stood by his rating. ""The federal response, once again, was at a historic proportion,"" Sanders said. ""We're continuing to work with the people of Puerto Rico and do the best we can to provide federal assistance, particularly working with the governor there in Puerto Rico. And we'll continue to do so."" The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from ABC News regarding the George Washington University study. In the months following Hurricane Maria, Trump engaged in multiple public battles over criticism from local officials of the government's response to the disaster. He personally attacked San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz for ""poor leadership ability"" after Cruz issued an emotional public plea for help....Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.

Eric Mack,"How Wednesday's nationwide emergency alert test message might look on an iPhone. FEMA Don't worry: The government didn't just spam you. On Wednesday, the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System sent a test message to everyone using a cellphone in the US that runs on a network operated by a carrier participating in the Wireless Emergency Alert system. You'd know you got the message if the header read ""Presidential Alert."" The content of the message also made it clear that the message is only a drill. It'll read: ""THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed."" If you've ever received an Amber Alert on your phone, the WEA test probably looked similar. That's because both types of messages are sent through the same Federal Emergency Management Agency system. The WEA, launched in 2012, can be traced back to the 2006 Warning, Alert, and Response Network Act passed by Congress to fund a new emergency alert system called for by President George W. Bush. The moves came after criticism of the federal government's handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. This week's alert marks the first time the system has been tested nationwide. While Wednesday's alert was only a test, an actual presidential alert would mark a significant national crisis. ""When those messages appear on mobile devices, people should take those extremely seriously,"" Antwane Johnson, director of the IPAWS system, told CBS News. ""It has some direct impact on either life or safety."" How FEMA's emergency test works The test message was sent out at 11:18 a.m. PT/2:18 p.m. ET on Wednesday, though FEMA said it might take a few minutes for the test to make it to all phones. Your phone might have alerted you that the test message arrived in a slightly different manner than normal text notifications. ""WEA includes a special tone (some describe it as quite loud) and a vibration, both repeated twice,"" according to a description on the FEMA website. Most newer wireless phones are WEA-compatible, but you can check your phone's packaging or instructions to see if it is WEA-capable. WEA may also be referred to as ""government alerts"" or ""emergency alerts."" All the major national wireless carriers and most smaller service providers participate in the WEA program. Of course, to receive the alert, your phone had to be turned on and connected to a cell tower that allows you to connect to your participating carrier. While most WEA-enabled phones have a setting to turn off Amber Alerts and emergency alerts sent through the system, a Presidential Alert can't be blocked and should make it through on any compatible phone and network. The WEA test was to be followed by a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System, which is a similar message that will be played over broadcast radio and television stations, at 11:20 a.m. PT/2:20 p.m. ET.

Ruth Reader,"The Women’s March is taking some backlash for a tweet recognizing the death on Tuesday of late First Lady Barbara Bush. This is the second time in recent months that women have admonished the organization for aligning with leaders many deem problematic, highlighting the difficulty left-of-center grassroots organizations face of uniting under the same banner. Textbook example of white [supremacist] feminism: the @womensmarch celebrates the legacy of a woman who was deeply implicated in violence against women of color both domestically &amp; abroad. Once again throwing women of color under the bus/ignoring our experiences &amp; lives. pic.twitter.com/Z8aOqbUJIv — wikipedia ""Killmonger, But Make It Feminist"" brown (@eveewing) April 18, 2018 Several women took issue with Barbara Bush not only for deeply insensitive 2005 comments about evacuees in the wake of Hurricane Katrina but also for her rejection, in the mid-’90s, of Anita Hill’s sexual harassment claims against Clarence Thomas. Bush is also known for championing literacy for all and for fighting stigmas associated with HIV/AIDS. Just last month, the Women’s March faced rebukes over national co-chair Tamika Mallory’s support for Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has long been criticized for making anti-Semitic and anti-LGBTQ remarks. The Nation of Islam has historically enjoyed significant support in many black communities in the U.S., and Mallory herself credits the organization for helping her after the death of her son’s father. The Women’s March tries to represent a wide swath of people with many different agendas in the push for gender equality, and both incidents reflect how challenging that’s been in the year and a half since Trump won the presidency–a problem I noted in a piece earlier this year. Critics say the Women’s March has been quicker to call out bias and bigotry against black and Muslim communities than against other groups (particularly the Jewish community), making the Barbara Bush tweet especially odd. Perhaps it’s time for the group to distance itself (rhetorically as well as strategically) from public figures of past decades, or at least to acknowledge their failings upfront. The less-than-two-year-old organization has that luxury, after all, and might find its credibility bolstered for fighting discrimination in 2018 and beyond. At a minimum, it might piss off fewer of its own constituents–which seems like a good first step.",The activist organization is struggling to unite all its constituents under the same banner.

Joe Berkowitz,"Yesterday, Spike Lee debuted the trailer for his upcoming film, BLACKkKLANSMAN. It’s the farfetched-sounding but actually true story of a black detective in Colorado Springs working to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. (John David Washington stars, alongside Adam Driver.) From the looks of it, the film uses a comedic tone and a groovy soundtrack to make a very serious point about far-right fringe movements gravitating toward the mainstream. Lee anchors his point to our current moment by ending the trailer with a collection of klansmen chanting “America First.” From that alone, it would appear safe to assume that he is not a big fan of Donald Trump. Factoring in Lee’s entire filmography, including documentaries on Hurricane Katrina and the church bombing in Birmingham, along with his outspoken nature in general, provides context for the director’s epic rant against Trump from Cannes on Tuesday. Lee was presenting BLACKkKLANSMAN at the festival, his first time back in Palme d’Or competition since 1991. The film got a rousing response that turned into hushed awe when the end scene gave way to a documentary montage about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville last summer, which ended with protester Heather Heyer’s murder. When Lee spoke at a press conference about getting the blessing of Heyer’s mother to use the footage in the film, he erupted into a long monologue mostly about President Trump. “We have a guy in the White House—I’m not gonna say his fucking name—who defined that moment not just for Americans but the world, and that motherfucker was given the chance to say we are about love, not hate. And that motherfucker did not denounce the motherfucking Klan, the alt-right, and those Nazis motherfuckers. It was a defining moment, and he could have said to the world, not just the United States, that we were better than that,” Lee says at one point. By the time he is finished, the director appeared thoroughly rattled by his own words, and the events that inspired them.

Hayley Miller,"The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, tore into President Donald Trump after a study released this week estimated Hurricane Maria ’s death toll was at least 70 times higher than the government’s official count. Carmen Yulín Cruz blamed the Trump administration for not doing more to save the 4,645 people estimated by Harvard University researchers to have died as a result of last year’s historic storm. The government’s official death toll remains at 64. “It was about creating a narrative that made him and his administration look good,” Cruz said in an interview on Wednesday with the Latino Rebels radio program. “And many in the political class in Puerto Rico looked the other way, disregarded the truth and played into his narrative, that he gets a 10 out of a 10” for the federal response to the storm. “No, Mr. President ― you get 4,645 souls that were lost on your watch because the federal government that you are supposed to be in charge of was incapable of doing its job,” she said. The Harvard study, published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, found a lack of access to medical care was the primary cause for an increase in mortality rates in the roughly three months after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico on Sept. 20. Researchers said their 4,645 estimate is “likely to be conservative” and the death toll that can be tied to the hurricane may actually exceed 5,000. But the high death toll is just one of the study’s alarming revelations, such as the lingering effects of the storm on the island’s older population. Never forgotten! Never again! pic.twitter.com/9vym7egCid — Carmen Yulín Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) May 30, 2018 Trump repeatedly downplayed Hurricane Maria’s disastrous toll on Puerto Rico in the months following the storm. During an October visit to the island, Trump said Hurricane Maria wasn’t a “real catastrophe” like 2005′s Hurricane Katrina, which left over 1,800 dead in the Gulf Coast area. At the time, Puerto Rico’s official death toll for Hurricane Maria was 16. “Sixteen versus literally thousands of people,” Trump said in October. “Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what’s been taking place in Puerto Rico.” During the same trip, he cavalierly bizarrely tossed paper towels to local residents and lamented how much federal money was being spent on the disaster relief efforts. “I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack — because we’ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico and that’s fine, we’ve saved a lot of lives,” Trump told local officials at an airport hangar. Cruz had begged the federal government to increase rescue and relief efforts, accusing Trump of turning his back on fellow Americans. Trump responded by calling Cruz “nasty” and claiming her accusations were politically motivated. “It took too long to understand the need for an appropriate response was NOT about politics but about saving lives,” Cruz tweeted Tuesday in response to the Harvard study. During an appearance that same day on “CBS This Morning,” Cruz demanded the government be held accountable for “the negligence that allowed those lives to be lost.” “These people were killed by the neglect of two governments,” Cruz said. “One: the Trump administration that was very dismissive of the value of our lives. And two: those in Puerto Rico that favored political positioning rather than telling the truth.” ""The negligence that allowed those lives to be lost, needs to be accounted for,"" San Juan mayor @CarmenYulinCruz told @DavidBegnaud regarding the estimated death toll from Hurricane Maria. https://t.co/XKnNKSVYdD pic.twitter.com/1V68xUD6pT — CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) May 30, 2018 Trump has remained noticeably silent about the Harvard study on Twitter.

"Daniel Cusick, E&E News","Are mortality figures for disasters fueled by climate change being underreported? That question gained new relevance yesterday as research published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that 4,645 people died as a result of 2017’s Hurricane Maria. That’s 72 times more fatalities than were officially reported by the government after Maria swept across Puerto Rico last Sept. 20, flattening homes; wiping out electrical service; and displacing tens of thousands of U.S. residents who had limited access to food, water and other basic necessities. Yet in spite of the immense scale of the disaster, official government estimates placed Maria’s mortality figure at just 64 individuals as of late 2017. That figure, according to researchers from Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, is “a substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after Hurricane Maria.” If findings are accurate, Maria would be the second-deadliest U.S. hurricane in modern U.S. history, following the 1900 Galveston, Texas, storm that killed an estimated 8,000 people. The Lake Okeechobee, Fla., hurricane of 1928 was blamed for 2,500 deaths, while 2005’s Hurricane Katrina contributed to 1,800 mortalities mostly in Louisiana and Mississippi, according to National Weather Service data. The Harvard research did not rely on formal reviews of death records or other documents submitted to Puerto Rican authorities. Rather, scholars surveyed 3,299 randomly chosen households across Puerto Rico to produce an independent estimate of all causes of mortality in the months after the hurricane. “Respondents were asked about displacement, infrastructure loss, and causes of death,” the authors said. Excess deaths were then calculated by comparing post-Maria deaths with the official mortality rate for the same period during the previous year. Analysis of the survey data showed a mortality rate of 14.3 deaths per 1,000 people from the period of Sept. 20 to Dec. 31, 2017, yielding a total number of excess deaths at 4,645 people with a confidence interval of 95 percent. According to survey findings, interruption of medical care was the primary cause of sustained high mortality rates in the months after Maria, a phenomenon also observed after Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey and Irma, as well as Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Moreover, the researchers said, actual mortality could still be underreported due to “survivor bias,” adding that one-third of the reported deaths were attributed to delayed or interrupted health care and that “hurricane-related migration was substantial.” Independent experts say such findings speak to a broader concern among public health practitioners that damages from major weather events, including hurricanes, droughts and floods, are often underreported. Kristie Ebi, an endowed professor of public health sciences at the University of Washington who has studied the health implications of climate change for 20 years, said in a telephone interview that tallying deaths from natural disasters has always been fraught with uncertainty, but study methods like those used by Harvard are the best way to overcome those limitations. “These humanitarian crises are inherently chaotic, and to try to reconstruct the chain of causality of death afterward is quite difficult,” she said. “But it’s important that you arrive at a number that gives you a sense of the magnitude of the event.” Ebi also said she was confident the researchers had arrived at a mortality estimate much closer to what Puerto Rico actually experienced during Maria. The government should use the findings, she said, to improve its own data collection methods so that disaster response policies can be tailored to meet the challenges of severe events. The Harvard study notes that under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards, deaths from an event like Maria “can be directly attributed to a tropical cyclone if they are caused by forces related to the event, such as flying debris, or if they are caused by unsafe or unhealthy conditions resulting in injury, illness, or loss of necessary medical services.” But while direct causes of death are relatively easy to assign by medical examiners and forensics experts, mortality resulting from indirect complications and conditions, such as chronic or worsening disease or delayed medical treatments, may not be fully recorded. “These difficulties pose substantial challenges for the accurate and timely estimation of official all-cause hurricane-related mortality,” the researchers said.

Stef Schrader,"Recovery from a major natural disaster doesn’t happen overnight. There are still folks along the Gulf Coast who are still struggling to rebuild after Hurricane Harvey tied Hurricane Katrina for the most destructive storm in US history in 2017. So, Robb Holland had an idea: To transform a Toyota 86 flooded during Hurricane Harvey into a race car in order to raise awareness and drive funds to the State Firefighters and Fire Marshals’ Association of Texas. Here’s how it went. The idea seemed simple: we find a Toyota 86 that damaged in Hurricane Harvey, and then do whatever… Read more Read The biggest hang-up, oddly enough, was finding a manual 86. Holland tried to find a minimally damaged car to avoid having to chase too many gremlins down, and while they existed, all of the ones he could find were automatic. So, a transmission swap was in order. After that, plus the addition of a kit of mods from Toyota Motorsports that was originally put together to run Toyota 86s in a one-make VLN racing class at the Nürburgring, we had a race car that could be entered in the World Racing League race at MSR-Houston. Weirdly enough, another hang-up was finding a charity that was still accepting donations related to the hurricane. I live in Texas, so I still see some of the lasting devastation whenever I go along the coast, yet because it’s not the latest news headline anymore, many of the efforts focused on recovery have closed up shop. Fortunately, Robb was able to find a worthy cause to drive donations to over the weekend: the State Firefighters and Fire Marshals’ Association of Texas. Their group includes some of the first responders who helped out during Harvey, some of whom were still struggling to make ends meet. The SFFMA got a nice bump in donations from the weekend, and of course, if you’re interested in helping out some of the guys who put their lives on the line to help out during Harvey, you can do so at their website here. So, if you find yourself picking through Copart listings wondering what you can do with seemingly DOA cars, maybe it’s worth giving it a try. The 86 was a blast to drive and finished Saturday’s race with a respectable fifth place finish in its class.","Recovery from a major natural disaster doesn’t happen overnight.

(Oct. 12) AP Becky Daniel reacts to seeing her Beacon Hill home, behind her, on Oct. 11, 2018. It was destroyed in Hurricane Michael. The area is right next to Mexico City, which was ground zero for the hurricane. (Photo: Andrew West, USA TODAY Network) WASHINGTON Federal officials helping Florida and other states dig out from the vast damage of Hurricane Michael said Friday it remains too dangerous to return to areas flooded by storm surge such as in Bay County. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who just went through one of most devastating storms this country has seen since 1851, FEMA Director Brock Long told reporters while coordinating assistance in Washington. Rest assured that not only am I doing everything that I can, but the dedicated staff of FEMA and the coordinated federal response is doing everything that we can to alleviate pain and suffering as quickly as we can. Emergency teams are focused on restoring communications and transportation. But Long said debris and storm damage in some areas prevents a safe return yet, with gas and power lines damaged. Its still not safe to return, particularly to Bay County, Florida, Long said. There is no infrastructure there to support you and quite honestly its a dangerous area to go back into. Crews are working to reopen damaged areas. Anybody who evacuated Mexico Beach who is in a shelter, its going to be a long time before theyre actually able to go back and return to those places because it was heavily damaged, Long said. Kevin Yeskey, acting deputy assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, said four hospitals and 11 nursing homes in Florida were closed Friday, while all remain open in Georgia. In Panama City, the two largest Bay Medical Sacred Heart Hospital and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center have evacuated patients but are treating those who arrive in the emergency room, Yeskey said. Secretary Alex Azar declared an emergency in Georgia on Thursday following Florida earlier in the week to make payments more flexible to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, providers and suppliers. When returning to damaged areas, Yeskey urged residents to consult with health and emergency authorities, and to wear boots, eye protection and gloves. In many places its not safe to go back to your residence, Yeskey said. More: 'This was our heart. It's just gone': Death toll from Michael climbs to 11 More: Michael officially stronger than Katrina at landfall More: Ive lived through (and covered) many hurricanes in Florida. Hurricane Michael was different. The Coast Guard has rescued 129 people and one animal, and helped transport 142 nursing home patients to safe haven at Pensacola hospital. The Coast Guard deployed 17 cutters, nine fixed-wing and 24 rotary-wing aircraft for search and rescue, and to assess damage. The Coast Guard continues to assess damage in Bay and Gulf counties, and urged residents not to board partially sunken vessels without assistance. The ports in Pensacola and Cedar Key reopened. But Panama City port remained closed in Florida, and ports in Wilmington and Morehead City, N.C., remained closed Friday. The Red Cross has 1,000 trained disaster personnel heading to the area.

Elizabeth Zwirz,"President Trump on Tuesday touted what he described as the “incredibly successful” response to the back-to-back hurricanes that struck Puerto Rico last year. The president’s remarks came in the midst of an update in the Oval Office with officials on the status of Hurricane Florence, currently making its way towards the East Coast. “I think Puerto Rico was incredibly successful,” Trump said, adding that he thought the storms that hit the island were “probably the hardest” thus far due to “the island nature.” “The job that FEMA and law enforcement and everybody did, working along with the governor in Puerto Rico, I think was tremendous. I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success,” Trump said. “Texas we have been given A-pluses for. Florida we’ve been given A-pluses for. I think in a certain way the best job we did was Puerto Rico but nobody would understand that, I mean it’s harder to understand.” President Trump listens as FEMA Administrator Brock Long, center, talks about Hurricane Florence in the Oval Office of the White House on Tuesday with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, right. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) HURRICANE FLORENCE’S PATH: TRACK THE STORM HERE Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck the island in September 2017, the latter of which had its official death toll increased last month from 64 people dead to 2,975. The updated number came via an independent investigation ordered by the local government, prompting Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello to raise the official total. The Trump administration's efforts in Puerto Rico received widespread criticism. But after visiting the island last September, the president said that Puerto Ricans were fortunate that the storm did not yield a catastrophe akin to the havoc wreaked by Hurricane Katrina along the Gulf Coast in 2005. In response to the president’s comments, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello issued a statement Tuesday on “the worst natural disaster in our modern history.” (AP) In response to the president’s comments, Rossello issued a statement Tuesday on “the worst natural disaster in our modern history.” “No relationship between a colony and the federal government can ever be called ‘successful’ because Puerto Ricans lack certain inalienable rights enjoyed by our fellow Americans in the states. The historical relationship between Puerto Rico and Washington is unfair and unAmerican. It is certainly not a successful relationship,” Rossello said. “This was the worst natural disaster in our modern history. Our basic infrastructure was devastated, thousands of our people lost their lives and many others still struggle,” the statement continued. “Now is not the time to pass judgement; it is time to channel every effort to improve the lives of over 3 million Americans in Puerto Rico.” PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR RAISES HURRICANE MARIA DEATH TOLL FROM 64 TO 2,975 Several Democratic lawmakers came out against the president’s words on Tuesday, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who tweeted that “Americans expect their presidents to own up to their failures” and that Trump “must stop trying to deny that tragedy &amp; take steps to save lives in the future.” House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., released a statement calling for the president to apologize. “President Trump’s characterization of his administration’s botched response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria as ‘incredibly successful’ and ‘one of the best jobs that’s ever been done’ is offensive to the families of the nearly 3,000 Americans who were killed and the countless more who suffered for months without power or running water,” Hoyer said in a statement. “He ought to apologize, and Congress ought to investigate what went wrong with the Trump Administration’s response and identify steps to ensure it does not happen again.” “With another storm now threatening our country, I pray that the President and his team are not taking the same approach they did last year in preparing to meet this challenge,” the statement continued. With the pending arrival of Hurricane Florence, Trump on Tuesday vowed that “the safety of the American people is my absolute highest priority” and that the government was “totally prepared” and would be “sparing no expense” in response efforts.

The Conversation,"Some companies and community groups didn't wait for Hurricane Florence to make landfall before organizing donation drives. But as a researcher with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, an interdisciplinary center at Harvard University dedicated to relieving human suffering in wartime and disasters by analyzing and improving the way professionals and communities respond to emergencies, I wish they would have. I've studied dozens of disasters, from Hurricane Maria and Superstorm Sandy to the South Asian tsunami and one thing is clear: In-kind donations of items such as food, clothing, toiletries, and diapers are often the last thing that is needed in disaster-affected areas. Delivering things that people on the ground need simply doesn't help disaster-struck communities as much as giving them — and relief organizations — money to buy what they need. What's more, truckloads of blue jeans and cases of Lunchables can actually interfere with official relief efforts. If you want to do the greatest good, send money. What's wrong with in-kind donations As humanitarian workers and volunteers have witnessed after disasters like Haiti's 2010 earthquake and Southeast Asia's Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, disaster relief efforts repeatedly provide lessons in good intentions gone wrong. At best, in-kind donations augment official efforts and provide the locals with some additional comfort, especially when those donations come from nearby. When various levels of government failed to meet the needs of Hurricane Katrina victims, for example, community, faith-based and private sector organizations stepped in to fill many of the gaps. Delivering things that people on the ground need simply doesn't help disaster-struck communities as much as giving them — and relief organizations — money to buy what they need. Joe Raedle/Getty Images How can in-kind donations cause more harm than good? Donated goods raise the cost of the response cycle: from collecting, sorting, packaging and shipping bulky items across long distances to, upon arrival, reception, sorting, warehousing, and distribution. Delivering this aid is tough in disaster areas since transportation infrastructure, such as airports, seaports, roads, and bridges, are likely to be, if not damaged or incapacitated by the initial disaster, already clogged by the surge of incoming first responders, relief shipments, and equipment. This is especially the case in places like the Outer Banks, a string of barrier islands off North Carolina's coast, where the challenges of bringing relief goods in, and distributing them to people who need supplies, are heightened by geography. Dumping grounds At worst, disaster zones become dumping grounds for inappropriate goods that delay actual relief efforts and harm local economies. After the 2004 South Asian tsunami, shipping containers full of ill-suited items such as used high-heeled shoes, ski gear, and expired medications poured into the affected countries. This junk clogged ports and roads, polluting already ravaged areas and diverting personnel, trucks, and storage facilities from actual relief efforts. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, many untrained and uninvited American volunteers bringing unnecessary goods ended up needing assistance themselves. In-kind donations often not only fail to help those in actual need but cause congestion, tie up resources and further hurt local economies when dumped on the market, as research from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies determined. Research confirms that a significant portion of aid dispatched to disaster areas is "" non-priority,"" inappropriate or useless. One study led by José Holguín-Veras, a Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute expert on humanitarian logistics, found that 50% to 70% of the goods that arrive during these emergencies should never have been sent and interfere with recovery efforts. After the 2011 Joplin, Missouri, tornado and the Tōhoku, Japan, earthquake, for example, excessive donations of clothing and blankets tied up relief personnel. Relief workers consider these well-meaning but inconvenient donations as a "" second-tier disaster "" due to the disruption they cause. What else can you do? Instead of shipping your hand-me-downs, donate money to trusted and established organizations with extensive experience and expertise — and local ties. Give to groups that make it clear where the money will go. Choose relief efforts that will procure supplies near the disaster area, which will help the local economy recover. You can also consult organizations like Charity Navigator that evaluate charities' financial performance. Department of Homeland Security personnel deliver supplies to Santa Ana community residents in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Guayama, Puerto Rico. Associated Press/Carlos Giusti Many humanitarian aid organizations themselves have increasingly adopted cash-based approaches in recent years, though money remains a small share of overall humanitarian aid worldwide. Evaluations of the effectiveness of such programs vary and are context-dependent. Nonetheless, emerging evidence suggests that disbursing cash is often the best way to help people in disaster zones get the food and shelter they need. What's more, the World Food Program and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees say that people affected by disasters tend to prefer cash over in-kind aid due to the dignity, control, and flexibility it gives them. Some exceptions There are a few notable exceptions to this advice on avoiding in-kind donations. If you live in or near the affected area, it is helpful to consider dropping the specific items victims are requesting at local food banks, shelters, and other community organizations. Just make sure that the items won't perish by the time they can be distributed. For areas in Hurricane Florence's path, for instance, the Red Cross has requested blood donations. Charity is a virtue. Particularly when disaster strikes, the urge to help is admirable. Yet this impulse should be channeled to do the greatest good. So please, if you would like to help from afar, let the professionals procure goods and services. Instead, donate money and listen to what people on the ground say they need. And don't stop giving after the disaster stops making headlines. A full recovery will take time and support long after the emergency responders and camera crews have moved on. This is an updated version of an article originally published on Sept. 4, 2017.","Carlo Allegri/Reuters In-kind donations of items such as food, clothing, and toiletries are often the last thing that is needed after disasters.

JADA YUAN,"The 52 Places Traveler Our new columnist finds plenty to celebrate in New Orleans, including fierce pride and a spirit of forgiveness. Credit Lily Padula On my first trip to New Orleans, eight years ago, I bought a new pair of sneakers. By the end of a week I had danced in the streets so much I’d worn holes through the bottoms of each of them, straight through to my socks. That, more than Mardi Gras or Jazz Fest or oak trees or gumbo, is my indelible image of the city: The only place in the world where I’ve had such a good time that the shoes melted right off my feet. I’m not a kismet kind of person, but recently I found those sneakers again, on the eve of a trip back to New Orleans that is the start of a complete 180-degree turn in my life. I had just gotten my dream job as the lucky writer who gets to spend the next year traveling to every destination on The New York Times’s annual 52 Places to Go list — and New Orleans happened to be both No. 1 on the list and the first stop of the trip. It’s a thrilling opportunity, and I’ve been a wreck. I had to quit my job as staff writer at New York Magazine, where I’ve worked since college; box up my entire apartment; and pack for a year on the road. I’m pretty sure I was crying when I found those sneakers, because I cried a lot that week. And yet I felt calmer than I had in months. Amid the chaos, it was as if a welcoming committee from the very city where I was starting this adventure had arrived in my living room and handed me a Sazerac: “You got this, girl.” Tourists can get a bad rap among locals, but we have history with the places we go to and love, too. I’ve spent maybe two months, cumulatively, exploring New Orleans. When I landed at the airport for this most recent visit, I already had a hotel that felt like home ( The Columns ), a least-favorite popular food (sorry, po’ boy fans), a local institution I recommend to all new visitors ( Backstreet Cultural Museum in Tremé) and a favorite leather bar in the French Quarter for getting a cheap 11 a.m. to-go Bloody Mary ( Rawhide2010 — though, the graphic S&amp;M playing on the TV screens at all times probably isn’t for everyone). My view of the city is in no way a comprehensive one, but it was molded by my tastes (and by the Anne Rice-loving friend from Brooklyn who introduced me to the city). That’s something that the obsessive reporter in me is going to have to come to terms with, as does any traveler to some degree: Try to do everything and you’ll wind up missing the most magical parts of being far from home. Scenes from New Orleans. Credit Jada Yuan/The New York Times “New Orleans is a feeling,” Angelika Joseph, a singer for the city’s only all-female brass band, The Pinettes, told me while chilling on a sidewalk after a show. “It’s your grandmother’s cooking,” Ms. Joseph, who is known as Jelly, went on. “It’s music, it’s fun, it’s food, it’s partying, it’s a parade all the time.” That feeling turns 300 this year, which marks the anniversary of when Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville founded the French Quarter. From the sense I got on the ground, though, the tricentennial ranks pretty far below Mardi Gras as a thing the city is excited about. Already on St. Charles Avenue, where I was staying, ladders were set up for the purpose of viewing parades that were two weeks out, and strings of beads from years past were dripping off every oak tree like moss. “We’re so cool, even our trees have bling,” I overheard someone say. Many people I talked to didn’t even know the 300th was happening. “Should I be excited about it? I guess I’m part of this 300 years celebration in that I was born and raised here, and I’m 54, so of that 300 years I’ve got half a century,” said Curtis Walker, an Uber driver who loves music and recommends the late-night club Seal’s Class Act. “I mean, I’m not getting no money from it. But maybe I’ll get a lot of rides.” Still, 300 years is a significant milestone for a city that often seems to be at risk of sinking into the sea. That it was so very nearly lost 12 years ago during Hurricane Katrina — or that there’s another one coming — is not lost on residents, who defend their home turf with fierce pride. I experienced that pride a bit when I wrote something offhand on Twitter about how locals were ending conversations by telling me to “be safe,” and that I got the impression that no one walked around after dark. It was a badly worded tweet, though not entirely off base. People were indeed telling me to be safe. New Orleans has a notorious violent crime rate, one that predominantly affects black men, but that sometimes spills over to tourists and residents. (Solo women travelers, as always, should exercise extra caution, no matter the outcry of locals.) But the city also has, I’ve learned, a very forgiving spirit. The same people who sent me angry messages had turned warm within minutes. One woman I met at the Pinettes show, Renee Lapeyrolerie, wrote me, “Badly worded, not a crime, just a sin lol enjoy the rest of your stay,” and then advised me to put my phone in a Ziploc bag in case it rained. The city is certainly in the midst of a post-Katrina upswing, with plenty of new dining and drinking spots (the St. Roch food market, Latitude 29, for instance), but there are still boarded-up houses in many neighborhoods and a kind of lingering sadness about the hurricane’s most lasting impact, which was a loss of community. Almost every New Orleans native I met told me about friends and family who fled flooded homes and have yet to be able to return. Among residents’ other regular complaints are the roads, which often seem to be more pothole than concrete, and the water quality, which had much of the city on a “boil water” advisory (including for bathing) due to frozen pipes just days before I arrived. At the satirical Krewe du Vieux, the first major parade of Mardi Gras season, most floats were rebukes of the Sewerage &amp; Water Board, whose failure to maintain drainage pumps resulted in damaging floods this summer. (Other targets were President Trump and the celebrity chef John Besh, who stepped down from his local restaurant empire in the wake of sexual misconduct accusations.) What is thriving is the arts scene. There are, of course, world-class art museums, the slavery-themed Whitney Plantation Museum, and the international arts fair Prospect 4 (which ends on Feb. 25), not to mention the wig artists at Fifi Mahony’s in the Quarter. But it’s school-level performing arts where the most exciting work is taking place. I got a chance to visit ReNEW Cultural Arts Academy, a public arts magnet middle school in the Garden District, as their marching band got ready for Mardi Gras. They were as impressive as any professional musicians you’ll find on Frenchman Street. “A lot of these kids, their parents weren’t in a band because of the migration to other states,” said Tenell Moore, the band director. “So we’re building new ‘bandheads,’ what we refer to them in New Orleans. We’re pushing hard to get it back.” It’s working. Out in the Seventh Ward at a booming local spot called Bullet’s Sports Bar, with no other businesses in sight, the Pinettes played to a packed Friday night house that included the New Orleans funk legend Mac Rebennack, better known as Dr. John. “My friend said, ‘Come out and hang out with some sisters,’ and I couldn’t believe how many white people are here. I was like, ‘I’m going home!’” he said. “Forget it, the Pinettes are the real deal. Overlooked way too long in New Orleans, maybe because they’re women.” The group was formed at St. Mary’s Academy, an all-female high school, and in 2013 won the Street Kings brass band competition. (Event organizers had to take a marker and cross out “Kings” and write in “Queens.”) Natasha Harris, the saxophonist, told me that none of them are full-time musicians: “We all have families, we all have jobs, we’re college-educated women, but we do this because it’s our passion.” They often have to perform without their full roster because there aren’t enough women instrumentalists around to act as substitutes for members who can’t make certain gigs. “Our hope,” Ms. Harris said, “is that middle school girls will come up and continue their passion, or that women will see us and realize it’s never too late. Pick that horn back up, keep it going.” Elsewhere, on St. Claude Avenue, I met another group of women at a nonprofit called Dancing Grounds who are trying to spread the empowering message of twerking. Jazz Johnson, who teaches a class called Twerk Party, moved back after years of dancing professionally in New York City, because she wanted be a corrective for a school system that stopped nurturing the arts after Katrina. “The kids, a lot of the ones I work with, they’re failing and all they keep doing is drilling them and giving them tests,” she said. “You take out the arts, it’s like, where’s the passion?” The city’s true currency, though, will always be its people, and while this may sound like lazy reporting, I found no better way to meet New Orleans natives than by riding in Lyfts and Ubers. In a predominantly service economy, ride sharing has become one of the most desirable jobs. “When Uber came to town, I fell in love with it,” Curtis Walker said. He had worked as a cook in a hospital (the city’s other thriving industry) and after a week of driving had doubled his take home pay. He quit immediately. In contrast to New York, every person I said hello to on the street not only said hello back, but also stopped and wanted to talk for a while: “All right, Miss Jada. Be safe.” One evening, walking in the Garden District, I happened upon George Kapowich, a white retired college professor, having a chat on his porch with Alfred W. Wesley, Jr., a black retired gardener who used to work for him. “One of the things that every newcomer says when they come here is, ‘Everybody talks to everybody here,” Mr. Kapowich said. “Race, age — none of that matters.” “True dat!” Mr. Wesley said. “You’ve been knowing me 35 years. Serious!” Another day, I went to the historically black neighborhood of Tremé and came upon Marion Colbert sitting on a bench by her door. Known as Miss Mary, she turns 90 in July and told me that every year the neighborhood throws her a birthday party in the street. “I can’t walk like I did no more. I got diabetes, arthritis and glaucoma, but I’m happy,” she said. “I can still see and talk to people. I don’t need millions.” Every once in a while, she would call out, “You have a nice day, honey,” to whomever happened to be passing by. “Thank you, have a beautiful day,” one woman replied. “Oh, it is,” Ms. Colbert replied. The night of Krewe du Vieux, I got to take one of my Lyft drivers, Michael J. Hill, to an after-party at The Pearl, a kitschy underground event space in the Marigny district filled with all manner of odd objects, including a sculpture of a full-size ostrich. Mr. Hill, who “just made 50,” as he put it, is a traveling barber when he’s not driving share rides, and wanted to pick me up on his tandem bicycle, until it got two flats on the way to the parade. He walked into the party and made quick friends with a woman wearing nothing but a clear shower curtain and a thong, plus other costumed folk, almost all of whom were white. “You’re learning about New Orleans,” he told me. “I’m learning about this for the first time!” Then he had to go home, because the next day was Sunday and he’s a church elder. Right before I left for New Orleans, my father, a Chinese scientist who lives in New Mexico, where I grew up, emailed me scanned pages from a guidebook called “Roadfood” by Jane and Michael Stern. It included definitions of terms like jambalaya and étoufeé, just in case I didn’t know what they were. It was a very “my dad” kind of thing to do. My whole life, he’s listened to zydeco music and tried to perfect cooking catfish. He introduced me to the 1986 thriller, “The Big Easy,” when I was far too young for it. This month, he told me he’s never been to New Orleans, which broke my heart. He works hard, has rarely had a vacation longer than 10 days, and just never made the time. My new dream is to take him once my crazy year is complete. I won’t be bringing those sneakers, though. I threw them out.

Mara Wilson,"On Wednesday, a polar vortex brought bitter cold to the Midwest. Overnight, Chicago reached a low of 21 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, making it slightly colder than Antarctica, Alaska, and the North Pole. Wind chills were 64 degrees below zero in Park Rapids, Minnesota, and 45 degrees below zero in Buffalo, North Dakota, according to the National Weather Service. Schools, restaurants, and businesses closed and more than a thousand flights have been canceled. Even the United States Postal Service stalled mail delivery, temporarily. “Due to this arctic outbreak and concerns for the safety of USPS employees,” the USPS announced Wednesday morning, “the Postal Service is suspending delivery Jan. 30 in the following 3-digit ZIP Code locations.” Twelve regions were listed as unsafe on Wednesday; on Thursday, eight remained. As global surface temperatures increase, so does the likelihood of extreme weather. In 2018 alone, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, mudslides, and other natural disasters cost at least $49 billion in the United States. As my colleague Vann R. Newkirk II reported, Puerto Rico is still confronting economic and structural devastation and resource scarcity from 2017’s Hurricane Maria. Natural disasters can wreck a community’s infrastructure, upending systems for months or years. There are some services, however, that remind us that life will eventually return, in some form, to normal. [ Read: The situation in Puerto Rico is untenable ] Days after the deadly 2017 wildfires in Santa Rosa, California, a drone caught footage of a USPS worker, Trevor Smith, driving through charred homes in that customary white van, collecting mail in an affected area. The video is striking: The operation is familiar, but the scene is apocalyptic. According to Rae Ann Haight, program manager for the national preparedness office at USPS, Smith was fulfilling a request made by some of the evacuees to pick up any mail that was left untouched. For Smith, this was just another day on the job. “I followed my route like I normally do,” Smith told a reporter. “As I’d come across a box that was up but with no house, I checked, and there was mail—outgoing mail—in it. And so we picked those up, and carried on.” The USPS has sophisticated contingency plans for natural disasters. It has 285 emergency-management teams across the country devoted to crisis control; Pat Mendonca, the senior director of the Postmaster General, told me that these teams are trained annually using a framework known as the three p’s: people, property, product. After a weather-necessitated service outage, the agency’s top priority is ensuring that employees are safe, after which it evaluates the health of infrastructure, such as the roads mail carriers drive on. Finally, it decides when and how to reopen operations. If the devastation is extreme, mail addressed to the area will get sent elsewhere. In response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, USPS preemptively diverted in-bound New Orleans mail to Houston, Texas. Mail that was already processed in New Orleans facilities was moved to an upper floor to protect it from water damage. But the agency aims to not keep delivery suspended for too long. “It’s our drive to get back out on the street with our carriers,” Mike Swigart, the director of national preparedness at USPS, told me in December, “because that’s our legislative responsibility.” As soon as it’s safe enough to be outside, couriers start distributing accumulated mail on the still-navigable routes. For those without standing addresses, USPS urges customers to file change-of-address forms with their new location. After Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, mail facilities were set up at the Houston Astrodome, and in dozens of other locations across the country in the two weeks that USPS was unable to provide street delivery. Every day, USPS processes, on average, 493.4 million pieces of mail: anything from postcards to employee benefits to medicine. Spokespeople from both USPS and UPS told me all mail is important. But some mail can be extremely sensitive and timely. According to data released by ACI Worldwide and Aite Group in January 2017, 56 percent of bills are paid online, which means that just under half of payments still rely on delivery services to be completed. [ Read: How a disaster’s economic impacts are calculated ] It can be hard to identify which parcels are carrying crucial items such as employees benefits, but USPS and UPS try their best to prioritize sensitive material. Swigart said that the benefit of being a federal agency is that USPS works “with other federal administrations, [and has] relationships with the state because we’re dealing with them every day.” They will, for example, coordinate with the Social Security Administration to make sure that social-security checks can reach the right people in a timely fashion. In the aftermaths of Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael last fall, USPS worked with state and local election boards to make sure that absentee ballots were available and received on time. Mail companies are logistics companies, which puts them in a special position to help when disaster strikes. In a 2011 USPS case study, the agency emphasized its massive infrastructure as a “unique federal asset” to be called upon in a disaster or terrorist attack. “I think we’re unique as a federal agency,” Swigart told me, “because we’re in literally every community in this country … We’re obligated to deliver to that point on a daily basis.” Private courier companies, which have more dollars to spend, use their expertise in logistics to help revitalize damaged areas after a disaster. For more than a decade, FedEx has supported the American Red Cross in its effort to get emergency supplies to areas affected by disasters, both domestically and internationally. It also donates millions of dollars to support responders and victims, according to a 2012 internal report, and sponsors organizations such as the Salvation Army. This same report explains that in the 2012 fiscal year—the year of Hurricane Sandy, the Rush Fire in California, and the Kamaishi earthquake and tsunami in Japan—the company transported the equivalent of 53 planes filled with donated aid, distributed over 1,200 Med-Packs to Medical Reserve Corps in California, and donated space for 3.1 million pounds of charitable shipping globally. Last October, the company pledged $1 million in cash and transportation support for Hurricanes Florence and Michael. UPS’s philanthropic arm, the UPS Foundation, uses the company’s logistics to help disaster-struck areas rebuild. “We realize that as a company with people, trucks, warehouses, we needed to play a larger role,” said Edurado Martinez, the president of the UPS Foundation. The company employs its trucks and planes to deliver food, medicine, and water. The day before I spoke to Martinez in November, he had been touring the damage from Hurricane Michael in Florida with the American Red Cross. “We have an obligation to make sure our communities are thriving, prosperous,” he said. “Our people who live and work in these communities can be in the same circumstances.” Rebuilding can take a long time, and even then, impressions of the disaster may still linger. “Katrina simply is our lives, whether we consciously acknowledge it or not,” Anne Gisleson, a Katrina survivor, wrote in The Atlantic in September. Returning to a sense of normalcy can be difficult, but there are some small routines—mail delivery being one of them—that may help residents remember that their communities are still their communities. “When they see that carrier back out on the street,” Swigart said, “that’s the first sign to them that life is starting to return to normal.”’","After a natural disaster, courier services such as USPS and UPS help communities return to a sense of normalcy.",2019-02-01T16:36:18Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",The Quiet Heroism of Mail Delivery,https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/what-happens-mail-during-natural-disaster/581794/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/01/RTR2LSED/facebook.jpg?1549038680,,Theatlantic.com,Hurricane Katrina,1
MARK KENNEDY / AP,"NEW YORK — Joy Behar and ABC were silent Thursday after an old photo resurfaced of “The View” co-host using makeup to darken her skin for a Halloween costume, the latest flashpoint in a series of blackface scandals making national headlines.
The 76-year-old didn’t mention the clip on Thursday’s show, one day after an editor for the entertainment website The Wrap tweeted the three-year-old segment of Behar discussing a resurgence of curly hair.
During the 2016 segment, Behar displayed a 1970s-era photo of herself at a Halloween party when she was 29. She says that the hair was her own and that she had dressed as a “beautiful African woman.”
Co-host Raven-Symone asked whether she had on tanning lotion. Behar, an outspoken liberal, said she wore makeup “that was a little bit darker than my skin.”
Messages seeking comment were not returned from Behar’s agent and the ABC program.
Critics were quick to point out that NBC cut ties with host Megyn Kelly last year after she created a furor by suggesting that it was OK for white people to wear blackface on Halloween.
This week, Virginia’s governor and attorney general are being criticizedfor their use of blackface. Florida Secretary of State Michael Ertel resigned last month after a photo surfaced showing him wearing blackface and dressing as a “Hurricane Katrina victim.”
Other white celebrities who have been called out for using blackface include Julianne Hough, who in 2012 dressed as characters from Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black,” and “Real Housewives of New York” star LuAnn De Lesseps, who dressed as Diana Ross for Halloween in 2017.

UN figures indicate that 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. Roles as primary caregivers and providers of food and fuel make them more vulnerable when flooding and drought occur. The 2015 Paris Agreement has made specific provision for the empowerment of women, recognising that they are disproportionately impacted.

""In the dry season, men go to the towns... leaving women to look after the community,"" explains Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, coordinator of the Association of Indigenous Women and People of Chad (AFPAT). With dry seasons now becoming longer, women are working harder to feed and care for their families without support. ""They become more vulnerable... it's very hard work,"" Ibrahim recently told the BBC's 100 Women initiative. A global problem It is not just women in rural areas who are affected. Globally, women are more likely to experience poverty, and to have less socioeconomic power than men. This makes it difficult to recover from disasters which affect infrastructure, jobs and housing. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shanika Reaux with her baby Tatiana were displaced by Hurricane Katrina After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, African American women were among the worst affected by flooding in Louisiana. As sea levels rise, low-lying cities like New Orleans will be increasingly at risk. ""In New Orleans, there was much higher poverty among the African American population before Katrina,"" says Jacquelyn Litt, professor of women's and gender studies at Rutgers University. ""More than half the poor families in the city were headed by single mothers,"" she told BBC News. ""[They] are reliant on interdependent community networks for their everyday survival and resources. The displacement that happened after Katrina essentially eroded those networks. It places women and their children at much greater risk."" In the immediate aftermath of extreme events, emergency shelters can be inadequately equipped to support women. The Superdome, in which evacuees were temporarily housed after Hurricane Katrina, didn't have enough sanitary products for the women accommodated there. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Katrina impact: Women and children waiting to be evacuated outside the New Orleans Superdome Increased incidences of violence against women, including sexual assault and rape, have also been documented in the wake of disasters. 'Natural' disasters? Much as climate change is accelerated by human behaviours, the impact of weather and climate events is influenced by societal structures. Disasters do not affect all people equally. In the wake of the 2004 tsunami, an Oxfam report found that surviving men outnumbered women by almost 3:1 in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India. While no one cause was clear, there were similar patterns across the region. Men were more likely to be able to swim, and women lost precious evacuation time trying to look after children and other relatives. Another study spanning 20 years noted that catastrophic events lowered women's life expectancy more than men; more women were being killed, or they were being killed younger. In countries where women had greater socioeconomic power, the difference reduced. Half the world In recognition of this vast disparity, governments and organisations working on climate change are gradually moving to include women's voices in policy and planning.

"USA TODAY, Rick Jervis, USA TODAY","The island was hit by yet another blackout after an excavator accidentally took down a transmission line. USA TODAY A person places some shoes to represent one of those killed by Hurricane Maria in front of the Capitol in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on June 1, 2018. (Photo: EPA) The Puerto Rican government acknowledged Thursday that the death toll from Hurricane Maria may have risen to more than 1,400 – an estimate many times higher than the official count it’s clung to for months. In a draft report to Congress posted online, the government claimed the revised number of deaths should be 1,427, based on public health records. It also claimed 527,000 homeowners reported damage to their homes and around 40 schools permanently closed due to structural damage from the storm. “Although the official death count from the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety was initially 64, the toll appears to be much higher,” the report said. The 411-page document, tilted “Transformation and Innovation in the Wake of Devastation: An Economic and Disaster Recovery Plan for Puerto Rico,” laid out specific plans the government hopes to implement post-Maria and estimated it will need about $125 billion over the next decade to rebuild. So far, around $35 billion in federal disaster recovery funds have been allocated for Puerto Rico. The acknowledgement of greater fatalities is significant because it places Maria in the category of historic deadly hurricanes, such as Hurricane Katrina, which claimed 1,800 lives after slamming into the Gulf Coast in 2005, said George Haddow, a senior fellow at Tulane University’s Disaster Resilience Leadership Academy and a former senior FEMA official in the Clinton administration. The higher death count is also key to rebuilding Puerto Rico to sustain new massive storms, he said. “The number of people who died and how they died should play a role in how they rebuild and how they enact hazard mitigation risk-reduction measures so a similar death toll doesn’t occur next time a similar hurricane hits the island,” Haddow said. The Puerto Rican government has been criticized for underplaying the number of deaths from the Category 4 storm, which cut through the middle of the island on Sept. 20, causing widespread destruction and plunging the island into a months-long blackout. A New York Times analysis of island records estimated the death toll to be around 1,052. In May, a Harvard University study estimated that anywhere between 800 and 8,500 people died for reasons related to Hurricane Maria. Last Slide Next Slide Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has acknowledged that the official count of 64 was likely low but hesitated to confirm a higher count until further studies were completed. The government commissioned George Washington University to conduct a more thorough study, due for release this month. Besides those who died in the immediate fury and floods of the storm, scores of others died when they weren’t able to access hospitals due to impassable roads, couldn’t plug in dialysis machines when the island went dark or because of the stress that clouded the island in the chaotic aftermath of the storm. The low official death count has sparked protests in San Juan and hindered the recovery process on the island. Earlier this year, Puerto Ricans laid thousands of pairs of shoes outside the island’s Capitol building to represent the uncounted dead. Last Slide Next Slide How to classify hurricane-related deaths has been debated since the storm struck 10 months ago. Two bills were introduced in Congress in June in an attempt to establish a new standard for counting deaths after a natural disaster.

ELIZABETH A. HARRIS,"Paul G. Lannon Jr., a lawyer at Holland &amp; Knight, which represents many private schools, says that in cases that are outside the statute of limitations, schools are under no legal obligation to pay, but they still sometimes offer substantial amounts. Mr. Lannon said he’d seen more than one claim settle outside the statute for more than $300,000. “I really see that the trend is schools are focused on trying to do the right thing, trying to help survivors heal,” Mr. Lannon said. Stephen Fife was kissed and groomed over the course of two school years by a teacher at Horace Mann School in the Bronx, who once tried to hold him down and rape him. He complained to an administrator at the time, and was told that by pressing the allegation, “you will only tarnish yourself,” he recalled. When he settled with the school about four years ago, he was decades outside the statute, and that was a crucial piece of the negotiations. He said that while the money he received was “beneficial,” it was about a fifth of what he was led to expect by his lawyer. He said the school kept going back to the statute, saying, in effect, “What we’re giving you is from the goodness of our hearts because we don’t have to give you anything.” Horace Mann did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Pingry does not dispute that Mr. Alton preyed on its students. In its report about sexual abuse released in the spring, it said Mr. Alton abused at least 27 students during his tenure there, and that faculty members observed behavior that should have raised alarms. Why did he have students in his office behind a locked door? When adults knocked, why was there a “delay” in answering? The report said that in 1980 Mr. Alton, who left the school at the end of the 1978 school year, pleaded guilty in New Jersey to three counts of Private Lewdness and three counts of Impairing Morals of a Minor after playing strip poker and masturbating with three 12-year-old boys who were in his fifth grade class at Pingry. He received a suspended sentence and five years of probation. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to second degree sodomy and first degree sexual abuse for incidents involving a 12-year-old boy and a 10-year-old boy. He was sent to prison until 1995. Photo Rice Fuller holds a photograph of himself, taken in the summer of 1977, around the same time that he says he was sexually abused at Pingry. Credit Yoon Byun for The New York Times After the school announced it was launching an investigation, 21 of his Pingry victims banded together to make their claims on the school. Represented by the same lawyers, they agreed to give depositions and then sit for mediation with Pingry in an effort to avoid a lawsuit. During his deposition, in a Hyatt hotel conference room in downtown Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Dackerman’s lawyers say one topic seemed to be of particular interest to Pingry: therapy he had received after he and his family were displaced from New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Mr. Dackerman said the abuse wasn’t the focus of his therapy, he was there to talk about his marriage and being out of work. But it did come up. That, his lawyers say, opens him to questions about when he discovered the damage left by his abuse. Rice Fuller was also abused at Pingry, beginning when he was in fifth grade in 1976, in a pattern he described as “so pervasive and so frequent, that when it was happening, it happened everywhere.” Mr. Alton abused him in his car, during Boy Scout trips, at summer camp, and in Mr. Alton’s office at Pingry, behind a heavy wooden door. “I can still hear that door shutting,” Mr. Fuller said. “There were times when people knocked on the door and we would be in there, and he would tell them to go away.” Mr. Fuller is a clinical psychologist, and during graduate school, while working at a psychiatric facility, he decided to see a therapist. Sexual abuse was not the reason he sought therapy, he said, but he discussed it. Mr. Fuller said there was some benefit to getting counseling when he did, but now he feels he’s being punished for it. “They’re going to pick off the people who have a statute of limitations problem, rather than saying we’re committed to doing everything we can to support the people who went through these atrocities — and they used that word in one of their letters, atrocities,” Mr. Fuller said. For each victim, Pingry’s lawyers could spend up to two hours taking their deposition, “and 95 percent of their time was spent on the statute of limitation issue,” said Stephen Crew, one of the lawyers representing the Pingry victims. “If they found somebody who had been to therapy, they’d dig and dig and dig and probe and probe, and it was abundantly clear, crystal clear, that that’s what they were looking for.” Photo Mr. Fuller says Mr. Alton abused him in his office and there were times that people knocked on the door. The teacher would tell them to go away. Credit Yoon Byun for The New York Times At the mediation in September, 19 survivors flew in, at their own expense, from all over the country and gathered around a long wooden conference table in a Manhattan office. One by one, they recounted their stories, in graphic detail, in a room crowded with lawyers, Pingry board members and insurers. Displayed next to the victims were pictures of themselves at the ages they were when the abuse occurred, all big smiles and uneven little boy haircuts, oversized adult teeth still new in their mouths. Mr. Crew said that he and his co-counsel, Peter B. Janci, believe all their clients have at least a “fighting chance” on the statute of limitations. But in mediation, “It became clear that the insurance company was not going to offer much of anything on some cases, and Pingry was not going to make up the difference. That’s where it fell apart,” Mr. Crew said. “I’ve got a set of brothers where one is in and one is out,” he said of Pingry’s interpretation of the statute. “I’ve got plaintiffs who were in the same tent, at the same time, on the same night, with the same perpetrator — one is in, and some are out.” In a statement, Nathaniel Conard, the headmaster of Pingry, said that the school, remained “committed to the ongoing mediation process.” He said that the school recognized the difficulty of the mediation process for survivors and that “We remain hopeful we can reach a resolution that helps the survivors heal and move forward, while also keeping our school stable and healthy for the students it serves today, and the students it will continue to serve into the future.” Marcy M. McMann, a lawyer for Mr. Alton, declined to comment. The Pingry survivors say they are negotiating as a block, and they refuse to leave any member of their group with nothing. “We’re just entries on a balance sheet, you’ve reduced my life to a line item on an insurance claim like a roof or a damaged car,” Mr. Humphrey said. “If I’m the only guy who gets a settlement, I’ll figure out how to split it between 21 men.” Continue reading the main story","John Humphrey is among a group of men seeking a settlement from the Pingry School, where they say they were sexually abused by a teacher in the 1970s.

Citing three unnamed sources, Politico said the DHS IG is investigating whether administrator Brock Long ""misused government resources and personnel"" on his weekend commutes back home to Hickory, N.C.

Nielsen confronted Long about the issue at a meeting in late August. FEMA is already under scrutiny as the potentially devastating Hurricane Florence prepares to make landfall along the Carolina coast.

JULIA JACOBO,"The Cajun Navy is sending volunteers to the Carolinas to help with rescues after Hurricane Florence brings torrential rainfall, record-breaking flooding and severe storm surge to the East Coast. Interested in Hurricane Florence? Add Hurricane Florence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Florence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The organization is expected to have 120 to 200 boats on the ground in affected areas by Thursday afternoon, Todd Terrell, the founder and president of the Louisiana Cajun Navy, told ABC News. The volunteers are converging onto Gaston, South Carolina, about 150 miles west of Myrtle Beach, Terrell said. Some members of the volunteer group are traveling more than 18 hours from Texas to North and South Carolina to provide resources and more manpower to first responders. Taylor Fontenot, a roofer in Sugar Land, Texas -- southwest of Houston -- joined America's Cajun Navy last year after Hurricane Harvey hit the Lone Star state in August 2017, he told ABC Houston station KTRK. ""I went out there that first night, and going out and saving people saved my life,"" he said of Harvey's impact on the Houston area. The Cajun Navy provided volunteers for Hurricanes Harvey in Houston, as well as Hurricane Irma in the Florida Keys and Hurricane Marine in Puerto Rico, during the 2017 season. The Cajun Navy did 35,000 rescues in just 10 days amid catastrophic flooding in Houston, Fontenot said, adding that the excitement from it all fuels his will to serve. ""Adrenaline, I found out, is a hell of a drug,"" he said. He also traveled to the Florida Keys after Hurricane Irma ravaged the islands in September 2017, and in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit just weeks later. In Puerto Rico, members of the Cajun Navy distributed more than 300,000 meals, Fontenot said. On Wednesday, Fontenot packed up diving gear, a rappelling harness, first aid supplies, a chainsaw and Houston Texans football cleats to bring with him to the Carolinas, he said. Texas resident Taylor Fontenot, a member of the Cajun Navy, is driving 18 hours to the Carolinas to help with efforts for Hurricane Florence. The organization is relying on volunteers' hours and donated cash for gas while it combats the effects of Florence, KTRK reported. The volunteers hope to keep the hurricane a ""zero-casualty event,"" Fontenot said. The Cajun Navy is an informal volunteer group -- comprising mainly of private boat owners -- who assist in search and rescue efforts. The organization was formed after Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005.

Zahra Hirji,"The Environmental Protection Agency has ordered 1,750 special coins to award to its staff for “response excellence” to the 2017 hurricane and wildfire seasons, according to a contract obtained by BuzzFeed News. The contract for the coins, first reported by CNN, comes as the Trump administration faces continued criticism over its response to last year’s string of devastating natural disasters, especially Hurricane Maria’s strike on Puerto Rico. Thousands of Puerto Ricans still don’t have power more than eight months later, and it’s still unknown exactly how many were killed — perhaps more than 5,700 people — by the storm. The EPA’s Office of Emergency Management is spending $8,522.50 on a contract with the company Lapel Pins Plus LLC for the so-called challenge coins and display cases. EPA officials plan to hand out the coins to winners of a “national award to celebrate response excellence during the 2017 Hurricane and Wildfire Season.” After Hurricane Harvey left large swaths of Texas under water, the Associated Press reported on flooding at several toxic waste sites in the state. The EPA then attacked the reporting. Since then, agency testing found Harvey’s rains did damage several toxic waste sites in Texas and has been involved in the slow clean-up. EPA officials have also helped with air monitoring, water testing, and other environmental responses after Hurricanes Irma and Maria swept through the Caribbean. The EPA requested the front of the coin have two circles, according to the contract. The inner circle will showcase the “EPA Emergency Response program logo"" and the outer circle will say: “HURRICANES HARVEY, IRMA, AND MARIA” and “THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES”. The contractor is designing the back of the coin. “The design should convey the sentiment that staff from all across the country worked together to respond to incidents from Puerto Rico to California (and regions in between),” the EPA wrote in the contract. The coin should also include the words “response excellence” and the year “2017,” per the contract, as well as an outer circle that says, “PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT ALL ACROSS AMERICA.” A concept sketch of the coin, meant to be a guide and not the actual design, was also included in the contract. BuzzFeed News got a copy of the contract from American Bridge, a DC-based progressive political action committee, which obtained it through a Freedom of Information Act request. News of the coins is rubbing some former EPA officials the the wrong way. ""Thousands of people in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands are still struggling with the long term impacts of Hurricane Maria,” Judith Enck, former EPA Region 2 head, told BuzzFeed News in an email. “Rather than wasting tax dollars on commemorative coins, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt should be sending letters of apology to the people of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. He has a lot to apologize for.” When asked about the coins, EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox told BuzzFeed News in an email: “This is not news: throughout the federal government challenge coins are awarded to various individuals, and the dedicated public servants who worked tirelessly throughout the 2017 disaster relief efforts should be commended for their service.” This isn’t the first time the EPA has ordered challenge coins to commemorate its hurricane response. The agency ordered coins after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, according to former officials. And in his first year in office, EPA head Scott Pruitt wanted to order oversized coins featuring symbols of him and his home state, such a bible verse, and not the agency’s logo, according to the New York Times. The coins were never ordered.","“PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT ALL ACROSS AMERICA,” the coin will say.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","2017 was a particularly active year for the Atlantic hurricane season. Not only was it one of the most destructive seasons, it was nearly as costly. Video provided by Newsy Newslook Members of a FEMA disaster response task force gear up to search homes in flood-ravaged Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, on Sept. 23, 2017. (Photo: Rick Jervis, USA TODAY) George Haddow hasn’t worked for the Federal Emergency Management Agency in nearly two decades. So he was surprised to receive an email in September asking him to return to work on a 30-day assignment in one of the country’s multiple disaster zones. That marked the first time Haddow, now a senior fellow with Tulane University’s Disaster Resilience Leadership Academy, had been solicited by FEMA since leaving, a move that underscores the measures the agency has taken to deal with this year’s onslaught of disasters. “Does FEMA have the capacity as it is formed and funded right now to deal with this type of disaster year?” said Haddow, who worked at FEMA as a White House liaison from 1993 to 2001 and didn't take the short-term assignment. “This year proves that it does not.” On many fronts, 2017 has been a record-setting year for disasters, with three major hurricanes striking U.S. shores, widespread flooding and a slew of devastating wildfires. The hurricanes alone caused an estimated $370 billion in damages and around 250 deaths on U.S. lands, making it by far the costliest U.S. hurricane season on record. More: From floods to fires, U.S. weather went to extremes in 2017 More: Winds from hell: Notorious 'Santa Anas' fuel ferocious California wildfires More: Nightmarish, destructive 2017 hurricane season comes to an end The three hurricanes impacted nearly 26 million people, or 8% of the U.S. population. By mid-October, more than 4 million survivors registered for FEMA assistance — greater than the number of people who registered for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma and Sandy combined, the agency said. The federal disaster response and recovery agency has been stretched to its limit delivering aid to survivors and helping rebuild storm-wrecked cities. To compensate, it recruited workers from other federal agencies, reached out to retirees and solicited state and local agencies for help. More than 22,300 members of the federal workforce have been deployed to Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. FEMA’s struggles to help impacted communities have been felt from the mountains of central Puerto Rico to the fire-mauled swaths of northern California. “They got hammered,” said Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Governor's Ofﬁce of Emergency Services. “Between Irma, Harvey, Puerto Rico — those are all big events. They leveraged everyone they have.” In California, FEMA set up a small team in place early on to help survivors of the wildfires that first devoured sections of the state’s wine country in October and later exploded in southern California earlier this month, he said. But as FEMA stretched its workers over multiple disaster zones in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the agency asked California’s emergency management officials for help staffing FEMA centers. “I’ve been doing this for 30 years and I can’t remember that ever happening before,” Ghilarducci said. “Every piece of everything we have in the toolbox has been leveraged this year.” Last Slide Next Slide As disasters sprouted across the USA, FEMA officials tapped into 3,800 extra workers in what’s known as the Department of Homeland Security’s “Surge Capacity Force,” as well as FEMA reservists, who are on-call for disasters. But when that wasn’t enough, they took the rare move of recruiting workers from other federal departments, who needed to be quickly trained and mobilized to disaster zones. Still short-handed, FEMA sent out emails to retirees and tapped into the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, or EMAC, a mutual aid agreement with states to share resources during times of need. Over the past six years, FEMA has recruited an average of 1,700 state workers per year through the EMAC agreement. So far this year, they've requested 17,790 — or 10 times the recent average. Only 2005 was higher, when FEMA recruited 67,048 state workers, due to Katrina and a string of other storms. Despite the lack of manpower, FEMA has been getting to disaster zones fast and helping millions of people in need, said Mike Sprayberry, president of the National Emergency Management Association. The true test will come when these spread-out disaster zones shift from response to long-term recovery, an area FEMA also oversees, he said. “The devil in the details is how we work it in the long-term recovery,” Sprayberry said. Funding has been another challenge. FEMA had only $2 billion on hand for disaster relief when Harvey barreled into South Texas on Aug. 17, according to the agency. Congress has passed two emergency disaster relief bills totaling more than $50 billion since then but need is outpacing funds. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló estimated damages to his island alone are around $95 billion. U.S. lawmakers are considering another multi-billion-dollar request for disaster funding but it may not be passed until next month. In October testimony to Congress, FEMA administrator Brock Long warned that disasters in the U.S. are becoming more frequent and costlier, due to more destructive storms and a widening gap between insured and uninsured losses. From 1995 through 2004, the White House approved 598 disaster declarations with a cost of $37 billion in FEMA assistance. From 2005 to 2014, that number jumped to 808 disasters at a cost of $107 billion, he said. “This unprecedented hurricane season has truly tested us as a nation and tested many of our assumptions about what works in disaster response and recovery,” Long said. Haddow, the former FEMA official, said President Trump was good at quickly declaring federal disasters to unlock money and resources.

Jack Date,"As Hurricane Florence clobbers the Carolinas, millions of residents have evacuated, leaving thousands of homes and businesses empty, including an especially attractive target for looters: gun stores. The Carolinas are home to more than 3,300 federally licensed firearms dealers, but with law enforcement stretched thin during the storm and its aftermath, criminals can take advantage. People walk through flooded Water Street as Hurricane Florence comes ashore in Wilmington, N.C., Sept. 14, 2018. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has recommended that gun dealers take measures to safeguard their businesses by securing or moving their inventories of guns to keep them from falling into the wrong hands. “During hurricanes and similar natural disasters, ATF regularly communicates with the Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) in the affected areas to ensure they are employing best safety practices available to secure their inventory and records during the storm,” ATF spokesman Christopher Elolf told ABC News. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, there were 35 reports of gun store burglaries with 1,012 guns stolen, according to ATF. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ike in 2008. there were just six reports of burglaries with 158 guns stolen. Last year, before Hurricane Harvey, ATF issued an alert to gun shops before the storm, encouraging dealers to secure their inventories before the storm and to offer help to any stores that needed it. As Hurricane Harvey flooded most of Houston, there were reports of five gun store burglaries, with 109 guns stolen. The owners of Cash America Pawn watched remotely on their surveillance system as burglars looted their gun shop. Harvey’s floodwaters prevented authorities from getting to the store before the crooks made off with 84 rifles, shotguns and handguns. The threat of stolen guns is magnified by the danger they pose when they are sold on the black market. “These crimes result in double harm – not only are the FFLs victimized (at times assaulted or killed in the course of a robbery), the stolen firearms fuel the illicit market, too often ending up in the hands of violent criminals who wreak havoc in our communities and pose an immediate threat to our partners on patrol who confront them,” ATF Acting Directory Thomas Brandon said in testimony before Congress. ATF is also the federal coordinating agency for public safety and security assistance during the response to Hurricane Florence. That means there are teams of federal agents already deployed to the hurricane zone, ready to respond to incidents, including gun store burglaries.",Gun stores are a constant target during hurricanes,2018-09-15T15:05:26Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Gun stores present a target for looters in hurricanes,https://abcnews.go.com/US/gun-stores-present-target-looters-hurricanes/story?id=57830598,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/florence-wilmington-house-tree-gty-ps-180914_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,Hurricane Katrina,1
"USA TODAY, Rick Jervis, USA TODAY","Puerto Rico is facing a galloping mental health crisis. Besides working to restore electricity and basic needs to residents after Hurricane Maria’s destructive run here, state officials are also scrambling to meet the mental health of its residents.

Residents here say they've been disappointed with the federal response following Hurricane Maria. (Photo: Rick Jervis, USA TODAY) Far more people died in Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria than initially thought, according to a new study. From September 2017 to February 2018, 2,975 people died, according to the study by George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, which was commissioned by the Puerto Rican government. That total is a dramatic increase from the official death count of 64, which the administration of Gov. Ricardo Rossello maintained in the 11 months since the storm. The death toll from this study would make Maria the second-deadliest hurricane in U.S. history. The study found doctors on the island were ill-equipped to properly classify deaths after a natural disaster and the government failed to prepare them before the 2017 hurricane season. It found that government emergency plans in place when Maria hit were not designed for hurricanes greater than a Category 1. Maria was a Category 4 with 154-mph winds. Damage was estimated at more than $100 billion. “The inadequate preparedness and personnel training for crisis and emergency risk communication, combined with numerous barriers to accurate, timely information and factors that increased rumor generation, ultimately decreased the perceived transparency and credibility of the Government of Puerto Rico,” the report said. More: 6 months after Hurricane Maria, life in Puerto Rico is better — but will 'never be normal again' More: Voices: Hurricane Maria couldn't destroy Puerto Rico's spirit-lifting food More: Voices: Citizens with boats filled rescue void a year ago during Hurricane Harvey floods The official death toll from Maria has been a point of contention since the storm ripped through the middle of the island Sept. 20, destroying homes and island infrastructure, displacing thousands and plunging the island into a blackout for months. Maria did not discriminate. People from all social and economic backgrounds perished in the storm, though the death count was higher for Puerto Ricans in poorer communities and elderly men. ""The latest study, commissioned by the Puerto Rican government, puts the tragedy of Hurricane Maria on the same scale as the September 11th attacks,"" Rep. Bennie Thompson D-Miss., ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement. ""Because FEMA and the Federal government were simply unprepared, thousands of our fellow American citizens have perished – and we now know that the poor and elderly were the most at risk."" Rossello acknowledged that the official toll of 64 was probably low but hesitated to raise that number until the GWU study was completed. Besides those directly killed by the storm, scores of others died when they weren’t able to access hospitals over impassable roads, couldn’t plug in dialysis machines when the island went dark or couldn't cope with the stress after the storm. The low official death count sparked protests in San Juan and hindered the island's recovery. This year, Puerto Ricans laid thousands of pairs of shoes outside the island’s Capitol building to represent the uncounted dead. Some media and academic studies estimated the death toll at more than 1,000 and a government report to Congress conceded that there may have been 1,400 more deaths in Puerto Rico after the storm than the previous year. The Center for Investigative Journalism, Puerto Rico, in a joint project with CNN, is analyzing thousands of post-Maria death certificates to try to determine an accurate death count. The GWU study would put Maria as the second-deadliest hurricane in U.S. history. The hurricane of 1900 in Galveston, Texas, killed 8,000 to 12,000, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Hurricane Katrina killed about 1,800 along the Gulf Coast in 2005. Researchers counted deaths from Maria over the span of six months — a much longer period than usual — because so many people were without power during that time, which probably led to more deaths. “That caused a number of issues,” said Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken institute. “It’s fairly striking that you have so many households without electricity for so long. That’s unusual in the U.S. after a disaster.” Contributing: Associated Press Follow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.

"AP, AP","NEW ORLEANS (AP) President Donald Trump has signed legislation awarding former New Orleans Saints and Washington State football player Steve Gleason the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress.
The 41-year-old Gleason has ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and Congress sought to honor him for his work as an advocate for people with the paralyzing neuromuscular disease.
Gleason is the first NFL player to receive a Congressional Gold Medal.
He became famous for blocking a punt in 2006 on the night the Superdome reopened after Hurricane Katrina. He retired from the NFL in 2008 and was diagnosed with ALS in 2011.
He has since spearheaded efforts through the Team Gleason foundation to develop and provide technology to help ALS patients live longer, more fulfilling lives. Those include devices that track eye movements to help paralyzed people type words that can be transformed into speech. Gleason has used the technology to communicate, post messages on social media, address lawmakers from around the world and give motivational speeches to athletes.
Congress last year approved the Gleason Act, which provided funding to help ALS patients get such devices.

Angus Chen,"Local forecasters knew Hurricane Harvey would be a bad storm. Their models suggested it would drop 10 to 15 inches of water across the city the first day after landfall, says Jeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District. “But if we go back,” he says, those models “were a bit low on the rainfall totals that Saturday night–Sunday morning period.” Northeast of Harvey’s eye on August 25, the hurricane encountered something scientists did not realize might contribute to the torrents that broke centuries-old rainfall and flood records: the City of Houston. Houston’s skyscrapers and concrete expanses likely exacerbated floods by altering the storm itself and making it rain harder, according to new research published in Nature Wednesday. “It’s very intriguing,” says Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who did not work on the study. “We know cyclones are sensitive to characteristics of the surface—mountains, streams, marshland. This new twist is that cities have become big enough to tangibly alter the storm.” To see how urban areas could do that, the researchers built a computer model of Harvey and the Houston area. “Then we removed the urban areas from Houston and replaced them with cropland,” says Gabriele Villarini, an environmental engineer at The University of Iowa and an author on the study. This allowed the scientists to see how the storm would likely have behaved if Houston did not exist. According to the model, urbanization in Houston may have caused Harvey to release far more rain than it would have if plains had existed in Harris County instead of neighborhoods. “The presence of urban areas enhanced all the things you need to get heavy precipitation,” Villarini says. Like most hurricanes, Harvey whipped across stretches of trees, hills and grasslands when it made landfall. The ruggedness of natural landscapes typically slows these storms down and—like water rushing over pebbles—forces the air above to bubble higher into the sky. There, in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, the storm cools and thus drops more rain. Tall buildings and sprawling suburbs like Houston’s artificially jack that ruggedness to new levels, Emanuel says, making the effect that land has on cyclones even more extreme. According to Villarini and his colleagues’ model, storms physically change in a couple ways under such circumstances, Emanuel says. First, the artificial ruggedness of an urban area slows air down. Whenever air slows in a hurricane, he says, it gets shunted toward the center of the storm and up into the sky. “That increases rainfall everywhere [in a metropolitan area],” he adds. A storm moves particularly slowly over downtown areas where buildings are tallest, but the winds bearing down from outside the city are still moving quickly. “So, [the storm] is piling up on the city,” Emanuel says. “And it has no place to go but up. Then you have the reverse situation downwind of the city, where air is falling back down.” That causes even more rain on the side of a city where the hurricane first plows into—in Harvey’s case, the southeast side—and less rain on the far side of the city. Overall these effects lead to more rainfall from tropical storms, Emanuel says. “It’s very noticeable. It may be on the order of 50 percent more rain. This is a powerful enough effect that you can see it through all the noise in [weather] systems,” he says, adding that the exact amount is highly variable because storm systems are so unpredictable and chaotic. Urbanization has the added consequence of increased paved surfaces like concrete or asphalt sidewalks and roads, Villarini notes. “Because no rainfall goes into the ground because of this, more water runs off on the surface,” he says. That makes flooding worse. When he included this into his analysis, he found Harris County’s risk of a Harvey-level flood had increased up to 21-fold due to Houston’s presence. If such findings are true, they would have significant implications for urban planners, Lindner says. “If we could see storm system after storm system produce the same rainfall patterns, where one side of the city sees more rainfall, that would be great,” he says. “We could target those areas for larger projects or more stringent building codes.” But until he sees the model applied to other cities or other storms with consistent results, Lindner says it does not help him forecast what future hurricanes will be like or help planners with flood interventions. “I can’t use this study, because this is one storm—one event,” he says. And in Lindner’s experience hurricanes do not have much of a pattern when it comes to flooding. “Just by working in the [20]15 and ’16 storms, I can tell you the heaviest rain did not fall in the eastern part of Houston,” he says. One thing does seem clear, however. Rainfall from hurricanes is increasing and will continue to do so, says Christina Patricola, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who was not involved in the work. “The development of cities and climate change are both human influences that are exacerbating the rainfall from cyclones,” she says. In her own work, also published Wednesday in Nature, she shows climate change may lead to a 15 to 35 percent increase in rainfall and likely made hurricanes Irma, Maria and Katrina deliver 5 to 10 percent more rainfall than they would have in the absence of climate change. Coastal cities will need to think very hard about how to prepare for both the increase in rainfall from climate change and continued urbanization, says Sam Brody, an urban planning professor at Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston who did not take part in the research. “After Harvey, the City of Houston—it still astonishes me to say this—passed the strongest building regulation for flooding,” he says. New Houston buildings must now be two feet above the 500-year flood line. “But [we need] to consider future conditions systematically, and not just in reaction to storms.”",Study shows Houston’s urban landscape may have physically changed Hurricane Harvey’s structure -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2018-11-14T20:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}","Cities Can Alter Hurricanes, Intensifying Their Rainfall",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cities-can-alter-hurricanes-intensifying-their-rainfall/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/822F7D81-EADA-4798-8D11787DA7A517A3.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,Hurricane Katrina,1
ELIZABETH A. HARRIS and MANNY FERNANDEZ,"Richard Carranza will lead the country’s biggest school district after a stint in Houston so brief that his record is hard to judge. Richard A. Carranza will become chancellor of the New York City school system, with its 1.1 million students, 75,000 teachers and 1,800 schools, on April 2. Credit Celeste Sloman for The New York Times If the New York City school system, with its 1.1 million students, were its own metropolis, it would be the 10th largest in the country, bigger than Austin, Indianapolis or San Francisco. And starting next month, there will be a new mayor in town. Richard A. Carranza will become chancellor of the system, with its 75,000 teachers and 1,800 schools, on April 2, taking on a job that is organizationally complex, intensely political — in a word, daunting. But Mr. Carranza comes to the position with only modest big-district experience on his résumé, making it difficult to judge the skills and accomplishments he will bring to the job. He spent seven years in San Francisco, first as a deputy superintendent and then leading the district, but there are just 14 public high schools in San Francisco. In New York, there are more than 400. Then he ran the schools in Houston, which is a larger system, but Mr. Carranza’s time there was so short that graduation rates from his first year in office have yet to be released. “You come in with a learning curve and you start to implement change, and then you’re gone,” Rhonda Skillern-Jones, the president of the Houston school board, said of Mr. Carranza’s legacy. “There wasn’t time to make a major overhaul or make a mark even, but there also wasn’t time to mess anything up.” Before Mr. de Blasio made his choice, he said he would pick someone who would hew closely to the agenda set during his first term by Chancellor Carmen Fariña. Mr. de Blasio’s initial selection of Alberto M. Carvalho, superintendent of the Miami-Dade County schools, took some by surprise. Mr. Carvalho had focused on increasing school choice through magnet programs and some charter schools — not Mr. de Blasio’s priority. But he was also a career educator who had demonstrated strong results in increasing graduation rates and was hailed as a shrewd choice. But after Mr. Carvalho’s very public about-face in turning the job down, the mayor seems to have reverted to a more familiar character. Mr. Carranza embracing the outgoing chancellor, Carmen Fariña, with his wife Monique after the March 5 news conference announcing his hiring. Credit Kevin Hagen for The New York Times In San Francisco, Mr. Carranza championed an effort to change discipline practices, a path Ms. Fariña and Mr. de Blasio have taken as well, and suspensions were reduced by half during his four years as superintendent. In Houston, he started a program called Achieve 180, aimed at improving low-performing schools, which is similar in its approach to Mr. de Blasio’s Renewal Schools program. The Renewal program has shown mixed results so far, while for Achieve 180, which is still in its first year, it is too soon to tell. Asked what had attracted the mayor to Mr. Carranza, Dean Fuleihan, first deputy mayor in New York City, who was deeply involved in the chancellor search, referred to the focus of his career. “From the moment he walks in a classroom, he’s in an urban setting with largely minority kids,” Mr. Fuleihan said. Mr. Carranza’s commitment to education, he continued, was “apparent through each step of his professional career.” At the March 5 news conference announcing his hiring, Mr. Carranza said there was “no daylight” between himself and mayor on their beliefs, and for a mayor who hopes to see schools as a key part of his legacy, that was surely appealing. But Mr. de Blasio also seemed compelled by Mr. Carranza’s life story. The grandson of immigrants from Mexico, Mr. Carranza, 51, grew up in Tucson; his mother was a hairdresser, his father a sheet-metal worker. The family spoke Spanish at home, and he learned English in public school. Mr. Carranza, an accomplished mariachi musician, worked his way through college at the University of Arizona, “gigging,” he said. He earned a masters in education from Northern Arizona University and has done doctoral coursework at Northern Arizona and Nova Southeastern Universities. Mr. Carranza has a twin brother, Reuben, who has found success in a very different field: He is a partner at Luxury Brand Partners, a company that makes beauty products carried at high-end department stores like Barneys. Like Ms. Fariña, the departing chancellor, Mr. Carranza is a lifelong educator. He has worked in school systems for 27 years, starting as a bilingual social studies and mariachi music teacher at Pueblo Magnet High School in Tucson, where he went on to become principal. Next, his career took him to Las Vegas, where he oversaw 66 schools and 66,000 students as a region superintendent. Then, on to San Francisco, where he was appointed deputy superintendent for instruction, innovation and social justice in 2009. In 2012, he became San Francisco’s superintendent. Norman Yee, a member of the board of supervisors in San Francisco and a former president of the city’s Board of Education, described Mr. Carranza as well liked and effective.

Mr. Carranza, an accomplished mariachi musician, worked his way through college at the University of Arizona, “gigging,” he said. Credit Karen Warren/Houston Chronicle “He didn’t come in saying, ‘I know how to do it the right way and everything else is wrong,’” Mr. Yee said. “He had a good sense of what was working and what was not working — and getting rid of what was not working.” While Mr. de Blasio’s relationships with charter schools in New York City have often been adversarial, Dave Levin, co-founder of the national charter network KIPP, said that Mr. Carranza was supportive when KIPP wanted to start a high school in San Francisco. “He was really helpful to us in getting it open, in getting public facilities, being supportive of it even through opposition,” Mr. Levin said. During Mr. Carranza’s time as deputy superintendent and superintendent, San Francisco saw some measurable success. Graduation rates rose by seven percentage points, and the gap narrowed between the graduation rates of black and Hispanic students and the rates of their white and Asian peers. But he failed to fix a persistent and glaring failure in the district: African-Americans in the city have long scored among the lowest in California on standardized tests. In 2016, the year that Mr. Carranza left San Francisco, 19 percent of African-American students were at grade level in English and 13 percent in math, according to a report by Innovate Public Schools, a nonprofit in the Bay Area. Also during his time in San Francisco, an employee who had been passed over for a leadership position sued the district, saying that Mr. Carranza created a hostile work environment for women, and that he retaliated against her after she saw him flirt with a woman who was not his wife. The suit was settled. Olivia Lapeyrolerie, the spokeswoman for the de Blasio administration, said City Hall was aware of the suit before hiring Mr. Carranza. “We’re confident that the allegation is completely false,” she said. “Mr. Carranza was never named in the suit nor was he involved in the settlement.” San Francisco has a big name, but with 56,000 students it is tiny compared to New York. New York City’s District 2, which includes several Manhattan neighborhoods, alone had 64,000 students last school year. There are 32 such districts in the city. On the first day of school in 2016, Mr. Carranza visited classrooms around Houston, including Law Elementary School. Credit Michael Ciaglo/Houston Chronicle “I went to look at the number and said, ‘Oh my goodness,’” said Aaron Pallas, chairman of the Department of Education Policy at Columbia University’s Teachers College. “Going to a system that’s 20 times larger, in many industries you don’t think of someone moving into a CEO role that is that large of a jump.” The districts Mr. Carranza led have not attracted the national buzz of places like Washington, D.C., or even smaller school systems like Newark’s, but he has been courted by big cities before. In 2015, he was in the running to lead the Los Angeles Unified School District. An article in The Los Angeles Times said his focuses in San Francisco on reducing suspensions and expanding access to technology were priorities in Los Angeles, as well. But Mr. Carranza removed himself from the competition, saying he wanted to stay on in San Francisco. Then in 2016, he moved on to Houston. Greg Meyers, a former member of the Houston school board who was involved in hiring Mr. Carranza, said that “his drive toward equity,” which the board took to be heartfelt, “was something that really stood out.” In Houston, Mr. Carranza took over a district four times as large as San Francisco’s, one that has presented him with a long list of challenges. It faces a $115 million budget shortfall and a potential takeover by the state’s education agency because it failed to improve chronically low-performing schools. Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc on school buildings and the city’s neighborhoods, diminished enrollment and threatened property values, which could mean less money for the district. Mr. Carranza also reported to a nine-member school board where each member is elected by a separate district, which meant their interests could often be at odds. “I think he really, really struggled to define where it was he wanted to take Houston,” said Anna Eastman, a former president of the Houston school board who was on the board during Mr. Carranza’s first year. “I think it’s hard for anyone to serve in that role with a board that is not really united around a common vision.” The central goals Mr. Carranza articulated in Houston revolved around giving poor students a better shot. One of his major, and most controversial, plans involved making changes to the city’s magnet-school programs by giving some preference to children from low-income families and eliminating many of the test-score and academic requirements. Houston’s high-performing magnet schools are dominated by white middle-class families, and factions of the board are fierce defenders of the current rules.

Mr. Carranza’s time in Houston was so short that graduation rates from his first year in office have yet to be released. Credit Michael Ciaglo/Houston Chronicle Another significant proposal was a change to the way schools were funded, which would take some discretion away from principals but provide a minimum level of staffing at every school. Neither the funding nor the magnet changes have yet been approved. Mr. Carranza’s initial magnet proposal, which called for cutting funding to many of the programs, angered parents and was withdrawn. Mr. Fuleihan, Mr. de Blasio’s deputy mayor, said that while 18 months — Mr. Carranza’s time in Houston — is a short tenure, the mayor found the vision Mr. Carranza outlined there to be appealing. Mr. Fuleihan also cited Mr. Carranza’s response to Hurricane Harvey, after which he quickly reopened schools, as evidence of his management skills, especially in light of bungled responses after other storms, like Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005. “How you respond to those things, and how calmly you do it, and how you put things together,” Mr. Fuleihan said of what New York officials saw in Mr. Carranza’s crisis response. “I think that’s very telling about how you can handle a school system like New York City.” Mr. Fuleihan also pointed out that for any new chancellor, New York City would be a big jump. The second largest district in the country, Los Angeles, serves 640,000 students, about 460,000 fewer than New York. Nonetheless, others found Mr. Carranza’s record of accomplishment lacking. Priscilla Wohlstetter, a distinguished research professor at Columbia University’s Teachers College who studies urban education, said that he has neither robust experience in a large district nor an established record of leadership in another big organization, as, for example, some superintendents with military backgrounds have shown. “The pipeline for superintendents is very thin,” Ms. Wohlstetter said. “We are the largest district in the country, and this is the caliber of person we end up appointing?” Bill Miller, an Austin lobbyist who has represented the Houston school district, said that Mr. Carranza was an “an A-plus human being, an A-plus educator,” but that he seemed to struggle with the internal politics of his job. “That’s not his natural bent,” Mr. Miller said. In New York City, he will have just one boss, Mr. de Blasio, which should simplify matters somewhat. But with New York’s cacophonous media landscape, the external forces Mr. Carranza faces are about to get a turbo charge. “Just as New York City is on steroids in regards to the number of students,” said Mr. Pallas of Columbia, “it’s probably on steroids with regards to the politics, as well.” Thomas Fuller contributed reporting from San Francisco","Richard A.

Ashley Fetters,"Alton Davis’s parents didn’t tell him much about the coming hurricane before they took shelter. All he knew was that the storm “might be dangerous,” so the family drove from their little house in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie uptown to Davis’s grandparents’ house near Audubon Park. It was a sturdy old building made of brick and stucco, Davis, now an architect, recalls. He’d been ordered to stay in the middle of the house and away from the windows. It was 1965, and Davis’s parents didn’t know much about the coming storm themselves: No one did. “We didn't have storm trackers or any of that stuff,” he says. “We just knew there was a hurricane coming. I don't think people had any idea what the damage could be.” On September 10, Davis, then 10 years old, rode out Hurricane Betsy while wrapped in a blanket and huddled together with his family in the center hallway of the house. Gallon jugs of drinking water were stationed nearby as they all listened to the wind whistle through the double doors. His little brother cried in his parents’ arms. “They hunkered down and just held us, kept us warm,” he remembers. Then, suddenly, the whistling stopped, and Davis’ father announced they were going outside. “It was beautiful. Blue, sunny skies,” Davis tells me. “There were trees uprooted and branch limbs everywhere. It was a mess. But we stood out on the front porch, and then the next thing you know, he says, ‘We need to go back in now.’” Davis didn’t understand at the time, but the eye of the storm, a brief period of calm weather, was passing over their house. The winds started up again as soon as they got inside and the “back end” of the hurricane resumed. Hurricane Betsy, which hit the Gulf Coast nearly a decade before the current standard for classifying storms was widely adopted, is believed today to have been equivalent to a Category 3 or even Category 4 hurricane when it made landfall in Louisiana. Today, most parents of hurricane-prone areas like Louisiana know better than to let their kids go outside during a major storm, even when the eye of the storm is passing over. Davis, now 63, has lived in the New Orleans area for most of his life, and he’s seen first-hand how families in the area are taking hurricane preparation increasingly seriously. When Hurricane Katrina hammered the city in 2005, Davis was again “hunkered down” with his brother, this time with their own kids under strict orders to stay inside until the storm had completely passed. Even though storm-tracking technology has grown more sophisticated and residents are better informed about the specific risks of each storm, Davis has noticed that his neighbors no longer tailor their preparations to individual hurricanes—rather, they start early and prepare for hurricane season. They prepare for the worst before it even materializes. To many Americans, it certainly feels like devastating hurricanes are happening more often than they used to. Indeed, four of the five costliest hurricanes in recorded U.S. history have made landfall in the last decade. And the fifth, Hurricane Katrina, was still in this century, killing more than 1,800 people and causing more than $125 billion in property damage after it hit in August 2005. One major factor in the rise of overall destruction is increased development along the hurricane-prone coastal regions of the U.S.—which means that more people are at risk of having their homes, schools, workplaces, and churches destroyed in a storm. But, for families, preventing physical damage is only half the battle. “One of the things we're finally recognizing is that disasters are social phenomena. That they have these complex social dynamics, and that we can't just think about it in terms of technological fixes,” explains Alice Fothergill, a sociologist at the University of Vermont and co-author of the book Children of Katrina. Which is largely why the social-science research on hurricanes has exploded in the past decade. Researchers now understand more about the personal toll that these devastating storms inflict on survivors, and especially very young survivors, than they did decades ago. And as a result, the way families prepare for, endure, and recover from hurricanes together looks altogether different even from when Alton Davis was a child in the ’60s. Part of the reason families have gotten better at responding to hurricanes is that federal agencies—including FEMA (which is part of the Department of Homeland Security) and the Department of Health and Human Services—have started to work with states to encourage families to develop safety plans well before a hurricane hits. FEMA, for example, has a printable “hurricane preparedness” checklist on its website that includes an inventory of what households should have on hand before a hurricane (categories include “medical needs,” “critical documents,” “tools and safety items,” and “food/supplies”) and what numbers, names, and meeting places family members should memorize should they get separated during the storm. For families, stocking up on food and water and boarding up windows aren’t the only things to consider. Agencies also recommend that parents take an active role in helping kids cope emotionally before, during, and after hurricanes and other disasters. Ready.gov, a website created by the DHS as a resource for families looking to plan ahead in case of a disaster, has an educational guide for parents about children’s typical reactions to disaster based on their age. Babies who have experienced trauma, it says, will cry more; teenagers may become more withdrawn or more prone to dangerous or risky behaviors. Preschool kids often get separation anxiety and later “reenact the incident or the disaster over and over again.” School-age kids may want to talk about the event continually and become intensely preoccupied with its minor details. How kids make sense of hurricanes Nicole Johnson, a 35-year-old community college instructor who lives in Durham, North Carolina, is one of the many parents figured out how to help her kids through Hurricane Florence. When I spoke to her on Wednesday evening, just a day and a half before the storm made landfall in the state, she was implementing some of the same strategies proffered by the DHS. Two days before, Johnson’s eight-year-old son had come to her, worried, and told her, “Mom, I don’t want to go to school on Thursday, even if they have school.” “I was like, ‘Well, let’s just wait and see,’” Johnson says. “I kept reminding him, ‘I won’t send you to school if I don’t think it’s safe for you to be at school.’ I think that was kind of relieving to him.” By Wednesday night, Johnson had moved from all-hands-on-deck preparation mode to waiting mode—she and her husband had spent the last three days filling their home with groceries, securing away furniture and toys from their yard, and using the delivery service Amazon Prime Now to stock up on supplies. Now, their biggest concern was how to maintain the sanity of three little kids—their son and two four-year-old twin girls—who were about to be confined to their home for what might be days on end. For the younger two of the three Johnson children, the most pressing concern about the coming storm was that their iPads might run out of battery. “We have more fully charged battery packs than people in our house right now,” Johnson says. In prepping their children for the hurricane, Johnson and her husband did, however, leave out a few details as to why her parents were in town for the week. They live on the coast in Wilmington, North Carolina, an area where residents were encouraged—though not required—to evacuate. “We didn't really explain how bad it's supposed to hit at their house,” Johnson says. (Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm on Friday evening, but not before it deluged the Carolinas with rain. Two hurricane-related fatalities were reported in Wilmington.) [ Why Hurricane Florence is so dangerous ] For families dealing with hurricanes, communication can be a game changer. When Fothergill, the sociologist, spent time with kids who had been through Hurricane Katrina, she found that what often upset those who were most affected was not knowing where their loved ones were. “This was true for a lot of kids whose parents don't live together, or who are very close to extended family members—maybe those who evacuate separately,” Fothergill says. “Having communication, knowing where they are and knowing that they're safe, is important.” Fothergill also found kids “felt really stressed and felt tremendous anxiety” when they couldn’t locate their friends. Of course, the desire to keep loved ones close is what often puts families at a disadvantage, too. “What we saw in Katrina was that people wanted to be with their whole families,"" she adds. “So, if someone couldn't evacuate, or wouldn't evacuate, families would say, ‘Well, let's just stick this out together.’ That happens quite a bit with elderly family members.” Kids whose families stayed behind to weather Hurricane Katrina in their homes, she said, were often traumatized by having been directly involved in scary situations. Fothergill also spoke to several parents who had tried to keep their families together through Katrina at all costs, “but still ended up in situations that were really difficult for their kids.” For example, some hospitals in New Orleans allowed employees to keep their children with them as they worked shifts during the storm, but as the basement flooded and the building lost power, it wasn’t the safest place for kids to be. So perhaps the most important precautions parents can take for their children are to reassure them that they’re out of harm’s way and to actually get them out of harm’s way. “In a lot of studies we find that kids who experience the intensity of the event do have a harder time coping,” Fothergill says. “It really is important to evacuate and not be in it. Being with family is important,” she adds, but so is “not feeling like they're in a life-threatening situation.” Families are also increasingly realizing that letting kids, if they’re able, be able part of the preparation of relief efforts can help them feel less powerless over the situation. “Let them be part of preparedness,” says Fothergill. “Let them be part of deciding what gets put in the car. Let them help a friend, or a grandparent. And afterwards, in the immediate aftermath, parents should figure out ways that kids can contribute, because it will help them heal.” That was the case for Cody Ward, who lived in Boca Raton, Florida with his mom and brother when Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne all hit in quick succession. After boarding up the windows in their house while their mother worked at Home Depot outfitting last-minute hurricane preppers with supplies, Ward and his brother proceeded down their street helping their neighbors fortify their homes. It’s probably not a coincidence that Ward, now 32, remembers that time not as a scary or trauma-inducing event, but as a time of community and goodwill. “It was fun,” Ward says of the day that he and his brother helped all their neighbors prepare for the worst. “We were all friends. We all grew up together.” If there’s one silver lining to the increased frequency of deadly hurricanes, it’s that the protocols for family survival are being assessed and improved with a new sense of urgency. “We’re having so many big storms,” says Fothergill, “that we're learning about where we've had weaknesses in our systems.” For example, after Hurricane Katrina, biological parents of kids in foster families who had evacuated the city had little idea how to reach them, as phone service often goes out during hurricanes. To complicate matters, some of the records linking kids to their birth parents in the state system were destroyed in the storm. “But the thing is,” she adds, “we're learning. I know the Department of Children and Families in New Jersey [where Hurricane Sandy hit in 2011] learned a lot from the Louisiana department about that.” There are, however, still some persistent weaknesses. The question of what to do with family pets in the event of a hurricane, for example, still often causes anguish for families. Leaving a pet behind can be life-threatening and traumatic for the animal, of course, but also, “it’s incredibly distressing to some children if the pets become lost or if they die, even if the separation isn’t long,” says Fothergill. There’s a similar dearth of good options for families with members who can’t evacuate or be with their families because of their age. Cody Ward now lives in Deerfield, Florida, where he works as a respiratory therapist in the neonatal intensive care unit of a children’s hospital. Immediately after a storm hits, some hospitals are still closed for visitation. In some cases, Ward says, new parents “may have just given birth two days before, and now they can’t see their kids.” When Hurricane Irma hit last year, Ward knew exactly how to talk to his own son about the hurricane—because his primary concern was why he was stuck inside the house. “He was two and half and had never really experienced anything,” Ward says. He’s already thinking of ways to change his approach as his son gets older. “I'm gonna have to look into it,” he says. And soon, before the next one—the inevitable next one—hits.","For many parents, ensuring that the kids are out of harm’s way is only half the battle.",2018-09-15T12:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Families Are Getting Better at Preparing for Hurricanes,https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/09/family-hurricane-preparation/570385/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/09/GettyImages_1032890856/facebook.jpg?1536964172,,Theatlantic.com,Hurricane Katrina,1

"USA TODAY, Rick Jervis, USA TODAY","Founded in 1718, New Orleans will turn 300 years old this year. The city plans to celebrate with a series of talks, concerts and street parades. Rick Jervis, USA TODAY Street musicians busk on Frenchmen Street in the Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans. (Photo: EDMUND D FOUNTAIN FOR USA TODAY) NEW ORLEANS — Ever since Canadian-born French explorer Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville chose the swampy, flood-prone bend in the lower Mississippi River in 1718 as the spot for a new French colony, New Orleans has been a non-stop roller coaster of historical events. Nouvelle-Orléans, as it was originally known, was ruled by three countries in less than a century — France, Spain and America — and swelled with Caribbean, European and African immigrants. It endured outbreaks of yellow fever, slave uprisings, river floods and one debilitating hurricane after another. The most recent big one, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, submerged 80% of the city, led to about 1,400 deaths and threatened the city’s very existence. This year, New Orleans, birthplace of jazz and jambalaya, celebrates its survival from three centuries of tumult with a 300th birthday party filled with exhibitions, panel discussions, street parades and parties. Throughout the city, large “300” signs have been set up in plazas and parks, each big enough for visitors to snap pictures beside. Sean Cummings, a New Orleans hotelier and entrepreneur, said the tricentennial is as much a tribute to the city’s resilience as it is its existence. “For me, it’s a (sign) that something here works,” he said. “It’s lasted for 300 years, and New Orleans has managed to be not only part of the physical landscape as an American city but in many ways part of the poetic landscape.” Last Slide Next Slide The city that today is New Orleans almost wasn’t. British explorers nearly claimed the area for themselves, and even the 18th-century aristocrats in Paris originally wanted their French outpost in Biloxi or farther upriver near modern-day Baton Rouge. Only Bienville’s machinations brought New Orleans to its present spot. After surviving disease, starvation and storms, New Orleans in the 19th century became a thriving center of commerce, reaping profits from cotton, banking, slaves and anything that floated up or down the Mississippi, said Lawrence Powell, a Tulane University historian and author of The Accidental City: Improvising New Orleans. By 1840, New Orleans was the third-largest banking center in the U.S., behind only New York and Baltimore, he said. “There was a time when this town was practically the center of the universe,” Powell said. New Orleans, like the rest of the nation, was gripped by World War I during the city’s 200th anniversary in 1918 and didn’t roll out much of a celebration. This year, expect the city to throw a true party, he said. “Three hundred years is a pretty good run,” Powell said. They'll be street performances at Congo Square, where slaves would meet and dance to beating drums, displays of 18th-century artifacts and documents explaining the city's founding, and a tricentennial fireworks show. More than anything, the city will be celebrating the various groups and cultures that have descended onto New Orleans over the years and forged its uniqueness, said Steven Bingler, a New Orleans architect and urban planner. Each new wave of immigrants to the city — from Spanish settlers to Sicilians to Senegalese — brought with them their particular style of food, music and architecture. Spanish settlers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries used local ingredients to morph their beloved paella dish into jambalaya. They also filled the French Quarter, the city’s oldest neighborhood, with homes decorated with ornate wrought-iron balconies and center courtyards, more akin to homes in Havana and Sevilla than anything found in the U.S., Bingler said.

British explorers nearly claimed the area for themselves and even the 18th-century aristocrats in Paris originally wanted their French outpost in Biloxi or farther upriver near modern-day Baton Rouge. (Photo: EDMUND D FOUNTAIN, FOR USA TODAY) Each new style had to somehow merge with the older traditions, a trend that continues today, Bingler said. “Almost every art form in New Orleans is connected to an earlier era,” he said. “That’s what distinguishes New Orleans.” Into the 20th and 21st centuries, New Orleans struggled through waves of economic depression, more blistering storms and a steady brain drain of its educated class. Hurricane Katrina infused billions of dollars of recovery money into the economy and led to some significant flood protection and public school improvements. Still, the economy appears stalled, job growth is slowing, and the poverty rate still lingers at around 24% — nearly double the U.S. average, according to the Brookings Institution. Murders and violent crime also remain challenges. Benny Jones Sr., leader of the Treme Brass Band, before performing at the d.b.a. nightclub in New Orleans.

Sam Barsanti,"Way back in February, we reported that Annette Bening was attached to star in FX’s American Crime Story: Katrina as Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, but a few months later the production “stalled” and series mastermind Ryan Murphy decided to delay Katrina in favor of The Assassination Of Gianni Versace. In August, Murphy came back and announced that the show had been retooled, with the story now being adapted from Sheri Fink’s Five Days At Memorial instead of being a more general story of how the government screwed up its Hurricane Katrina response. Speaking with Vanity Fair, Bening explained that the new version of the show no longer had a place for her, since the story now concerns a hospital that was forced to euthanize a number of critical patients when it was left without power for days and Governor Blanco doesn’t have much of a role there. She says the original Five Days At Memorial book is one of the “completely brilliant and thorough and thoughtful” books about Katrina, so she seems to agree that Murphy made the right choice by focusing on that story. “It was a great, great tragedy,” she says of Katrina, adding that there was a lot of “unnecessary suffering and death because of racism and poverty,” so it was important that Murphy tell the story “in the way that he thinks is right.” Sarah Paulson is now set to star in Katrina, and Murphy is still hoping to find new roles for Dennis Quaid and Matthew Broderick, who were supposed to star in the original incarnation with Bening.","Way back in February, we reported that Annette Bening was attached to star in FX’s American Crime Story: Katrina as Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, but a few months later the production “stalled” and series mastermind Ryan Murphy decided to delay Katrina …",2017-12-15T00:01:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Avclub.com'}",Annette Bening explains why she was written out of American Crime Story: Katrina,https://www.avclub.com/annette-bening-explains-why-she-was-written-out-of-amer-1821310539,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--QLbZdz1z--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/nzxqxz3vzovtsjdxqnn8.jpg",,Avclub.com,Hurricane Katrina,1

Vann R. Newkirk II,"The one-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria is next month. The island is still rebuilding, still preparing for a new hurricane season, still putting its power grid back together, and still dealing with the massive demographic, environmental, and political changes that have taken place as a result of last year’s disaster. And it’s still trying to figure out just who was lost in the catastrophe—the official death toll still sits at 64, a number we know to be at least an order of magnitude lower than the real count. A new analysis published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association helps shed some light on the true toll. That analysis from researchers Alexis Raúl Santos-Lozada at Pennsylvania State University and Jeffrey T. Howard at the University of Texas at San Antonio, finds that there were 1,139 excess deaths from September to December 2017 after Maria made landfall. This is a lower number than the 4,600 estimate reported from a survey in The New England Journal of Medicine in May, but is still another piece of data in a growing consensus that Maria was one of the great human catastrophes in American history. The death toll—and the fact that it’s taking so long for the island to put out reasonable estimates—is a source of tension between the Puerto Rican government, the Puerto Rican people, and the diaspora on the mainland. The idea that the island territory can’t even complete what should be the first recovery step in counting the losses and helping bereaved families is often seen as an indication of the ineptitude, unpreparedness and bureaucratic malaise that has affected many of the island’s post-Maria decisions. But what the ongoing effort has illustrated is that coming up with an official death toll is a logistical nightmare in the aftermath of a disaster that sparked a long-term mortality event, a major emigration, and threw Puerto Rico’s finances and governance in further disarray. Death certificates filed on the island could possibly underestimate the number of people who died from disaster-related effects like the loss of power across the island after the storm, while instruments like surveys of survivors could overestimate those deaths. Some people just disappeared, and others were probably quietly buried in a less-than-official capacity. In June, Governor Ricardo Rosselló faced a significant controversy when his government tried to withhold some administrative data on death counts, and then belatedly released the data after a court ordered it to do so. The data was critical to Santos’s and Howard’s research. They compiled official death counts in the seven years before the storm and averaged them month by month to create a baseline death rate. Then they measured the deaths in the months after Hurricane Maria. The differences between those death counts and the baseline are known as “excess deaths,” and they represent people likely killed from the storm and its aftereffects. The researchers found that Puerto Rico suffered 459 excess deaths in September of 2017, 564 in October, and 116 in November. Since the storm hit the island on September 20, the excess deaths in October especially point to the depths of the misery that the storm created, and to the costs of the collapse of infrastructure and a tepid initial disaster response. “When the area is flooded and without power, that’s not a safe environment for a grandmother on dialysis,” Santos said in a press release. “Essentially, that’s what we’re trying to address. Not just the people who drowned or died in landslides, but also the people who died because they didn't have access to their basic needs.” This April, dialysis patients in Puerto Rico were still traveling 12 hours for care. Still, this estimate is only one of several on the death toll of Hurricane Maria. Several journalists and independent researchers earlier reached similar numbers of just over 1,000 deaths. The previous major study in the NEJM from Harvard researchers that found over 4,000 deaths relied on a different methodology than any of these efforts. Santos and Howard criticize that methodology in their paper. “It was based on a survey that underestimated prehurricane mortality, overestimated posthurricane mortality, and had a large [confidence interval], indicating a high level of uncertainty,” they write. There’s plenty of ground still left to cover. Researchers at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health are embarked on what many believe will be the authoritative say in the matter, a comprehensive analysis of data provided by Puerto Rico’s government, which is expected out before the end of summer. Yet, it seems reasonable to think now that the baseline of somewhere north of 1,000 people lost from the disaster is a good estimate. The bad news is that estimate still makes Hurricane Maria the second-worst natural disaster on American soil in a century, behind Hurricane Katrina.","The newest estimate based on administrative data suggests over 1,100 people were killed by the 2017 storm and its fallout.",2018-08-02T16:00:12Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Researchers Are Still Counting the Dead From Hurricane Maria,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/researchers-are-still-counting-the-dead-from-hurricane-maria/566645/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/08/AP_18190795978441/facebook.jpg?1533172556,,Theatlantic.com,Hurricane Katrina,1

Why Your Phone Dies in the Cold Weather, and What You Can Do About It
How a Small Pacific Northwest Island Is Preparing for the Really Big One
Chesapeake Avenue, in the Salters Creek neighborhood of Newport News, Virginia, sits atop a sea wall that shields it from the Hampton Roads, the body of water that connects the mouths of the James and Elizabeth Rivers to the Chesapeake Bay near where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The avenue stretches 2.5 miles east from Newport News to neighboring Hampton. Many of the adjacent neighborhoods, including Salters Creek, where I grew up, sit just a few meters above sea level. Here, the sea wall is quite literally a last line of protection against climate change.
In 2003, I saw Hurricane Isabels storm surge pummel the wall, sending cars washing along the street and tearing a private pier off its foundation. But Ive also witnessed smaller, more frequent weather-related problems. The streets a couple blocks north of my family house have been flooding for decades, spilling onto lawns and making roads impassable. Years ago, they would flood only after heavy rainfalls, but now they flood even after more mild precipitation. Sometimes a mere high tide is enough to inundate the streets. Worse, as drinking water is removed from underground aquifers, the land sinks even further.
Its worth noting that the neighborhoods adjacent to Chesapeake Avenue have some of the lowest median incomesand highest proportions of black residentsin the Hampton Roads region. (This, despite the comparatively expensive homes, a few with courtyards and private tennis courts, set along the sea wall in Hampton.) It is an area that has seen climbing socio-economic inequality: From 2010 through 2015, median household and per capita incomes both fell more than 5 percent, when adjusted for inflation, even as incomes increased in Virginia overall. In these respects, the city is typical of many coastal population centers in the Southeast, where the blackest and poorest neighborhoods are also among those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. For residents of these neighborhoods, global warming isnt a faraway, long-term problem; its threatening their livelihoods right now.
Global warming can disproportionately affect black and less wealthy communities. Our governments policies should reflect that truth.
Perhaps nowhere was that reality more evident than in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, whose staggering intensity, some suggest, was at least partially attributable to anthropogenic global warming. The failure of the levees protecting the citys low-lying neighborhoods led to perhaps the most infamous weather-related catastrophe in modern times. Its hard to think of Katrina without recalling the television images of mostly black residents who were displaced, their lives upended, in the storms wake.
Because many of those residents couldnt afford to return and rebuild, the catastrophe left a permanent imprint on the citys makeup. The citys black population fell from 66.7 percent of the population to 59.1 percent between 2000 and 2013. The citizenry that remains is wealthier and whiter than it was before. What had been a city bifurcated by race and class before the storm became more so. Debates over topics like the fate of public schools, the remaking of historic neighborhoods, and the complexion of the citys leadership laid bare the citys racial fault lines. The hurricane didnt create those problems; it further fractured the already-existing fissures.
A similar dynamic is at work in Miami, where frequent flooding of expensive beachfront neighborhoods has helped drive up the demand for property in less wealthy, traditionally black neighborhoods inland. The result has been a migration of sorts, in which wealthy, white newcomers are gentrifying neighborhoods like Little Haiti and Liberty City, displacing longtime residents and long-standing businesses. In 2017, the real estate site Zillow listed Little Haiti as South Floridas hottest neighborhood.
Which brings us back to Hampton Roads, a region experiencing one of the highest rates of sea level rise among U.S. metropolitan areas. Much of the region is already vulnerable to chronic flooding, defined as flooding that occurs at least 26 times a year and covers at least 10 percent of the usable, non-wetland area. By 2045, more than 3,000 houses in the region are projected to be at that level of risk. In 2016, Norfolks Old Dominion University won a $120.5 million 2016 federal grant to stabilize the regions natural channels and shore up the surrounding wetlands. But for the foreseeable future, homes in neighborhoods like Salters Creek will remain vulnerable.
One response is to retreat inland, which means selling your house if you own property. But it can be difficult to find a willing buyer for a house in a flood zoneespecially if you lack access to capital, as is the case for so many families in Hampton Roads. Newport News has experimented with buyback programs, buying homes on a voluntary basis in Salters Creeks flood zone, but the effort is limited by the availability of local and state money.
As climate change marches forward, initiatives to protect neighborhoods like Salters Creek from rising seas and extreme weather will become increasingly important. The impacts of climate change cannot be disentangled from the politics of inequality and race; even the faceless menace of global warming can disproportionately affect black and less-wealthy communities. Our governments policies should reflect that truth. The livelihoods of people like my family and the neighbors I grew up with will depend on it.","Chesapeake Avenue, in the Salters Creek neighborhood of Newport News, Virginia, sits atop a sea wall that shields it from the Hampton Roads, the body of water that connects the mouths of the James and Elizabeth Rivers to the Chesapeake Bay near where it empti…",2019-02-20T18:59:41Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",I Know Climate Change Exacerbates Inequality.

Jennifer Bendery,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said Monday that the stories of migrant children being separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border are overblown. But a minute later, he admitted he had no idea what he was talking about. In an interview with conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt, Toomey was asked if he thinks Attorney General Jeff Sessions should reverse his new “zero-tolerance” immigration policy, which often separates children from their parents so the adults can be criminally prosecuted for crossing the border without documentation. Previously, authorities typically kept migrant families together and routed them to immigration courts. Toomey said he didn’t think Sessions should reverse the policy. “I think the instance of the, you know, the heart-wrenching separation of a small child from the mother is, has been, the frequency has been exaggerated significantly,” he said. “There are serious challenges at the border like, ‘Does the person claiming to be the parent, is that person actually the parent?’” Hewitt pushed back, citing news reports that nearly 2,000 children have been taken from their parents at the border in the span of six weeks. He pointed to other news reports describing children being put into cages in detention facilities akin to animal kennels. The Republican senator conceded he didn’t know much about the situation. “This is not my area of expertise, Hugh. I’m going to have to drill down into this and address it,” he said. “And maybe you’re right. Maybe this is happening with a higher frequency than I’ve been aware of, and it is certainly, it’s just not the right thing to be doing.” Asked if he thinks the immigration policy could lead to a humanitarian crisis for President Donald Trump along the levels that Hurricane Katrina was for President George W. Bush, Toomey, who had just said the situation was exaggerated, said yes. “Yeah. Yes. I suppose it could,” he said. “I mean, I think clearly, the country is focused on this. Clearly, it’s a horrendous situation if a small child is being taken away from the child’s actual mother. So I think we’ve got to solve this problem.” A Toomey spokesperson did not respond to a request for clarification on whether the senator thinks the frequency of family separations at the border is exaggerated versus fueling a potential humanitarian crisis.

Hilary Brueck,"Hurricane Michael was a powerful Category 4 storm when it made landfall on the Florida panhandle last week — the worst hurricane that area had ever seen. Louis Uccellini, the director of the National Weather Service (NWS), called it a ""worst case scenario"" for the area. ""Stay inside &amp; survive!"" he warned on Twitter. But Jon Zawislak didn't heed that warning. Instead, he flew straight into the eye of the storm. Zawislak holds a PhD in atmospheric science and works as a hurricane field program director for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). As part of that job, he was on the final forecasting flight into Michael as the storm approached land. ""It was probably the most turbulent flight we'd been on,"" Zawislak told Business Insider after the three pilots steering his plane safely landed the Lockheed WP-3D Orion aircraft back on the ground. Hurricane-hunting missions like this are the only way that the National Hurricane Center can collect vital information on how the eye of a big storm storm is developing. The flights provide data on the storm's wind speed and pressure that can't be gleaned from satellites above the hurricane or weather stations on the ground. On October 11, Zawislak and a crew of about a dozen other scientists, pilots, and technicians strapped into their seats and took off from Lakeland, Florida. The sky was still dark as they headed toward the middle of Michael's swirling clouds; it was the plane's fourth and last flight in the storm. Michael made for an extremely bumpy ride Zawislak said he could see the hurricane lighting up the air from his window. Zawislak estimates he's flown on about 40 missions through hurricanes and tropical storms, but said this flight was ""extreme."" Heading into the northeast corner of the storm was a moment he'll never forget: ""The airplane dropped out underneath of you,"" he said, and then, ""we were momentarily elevated out of our seats."" It was as if, for a split-second, the crew was soaring through the air, unsupported by a plane. Then, just as suddenly, their butts slammed back into their seats. That kind of upheaval is caused by strong updrafts and downdrafts. It didn't let up for the entire flight, Zawislak said. NOAA's hurricane hunter Lockheed WP 3D Orion N42RF is the plane Zawislak rides in. NOAA photo by Mike Mascaro One important measurement that hurricane hunters gather is the storm's central pressure: as a hurricane's winds pick up speed, the pressure at its core drops. That means there are fewer air molecules circulating inside the middle of a storm than around it, and the dramatic power difference is a key part of what makes hurricanes so dangerous. It's a clear indication to meteorologists that the cyclone is gathering strength. In Michael's case, hurricane hunters like Zawislak also recorded viciously high wind speeds inside the storm shortly before it made landfall, which was how forecasters knew it was a undergoing a dangerous process called ""rapid intensification."" Michael's wind speed rose by more than 40 mph in less than 24 hours. Those quick shifts make a hurricane like Michael particularly tricky to plan for in advance. On the ground, Michael has so far been blamed for 26 deaths, including 16 in Florida, according to the Associated Press. More than two dozen people are still missing in Mexico Beach, near where the storm made landfall. Thousands of others are unable to reach relatives and friends, and unsure if they're safe. The reasons why storms like Michael intensify so quickly aren't well understood. Scientists know hurricanes are fueled by warm water, but it's less clear what other processes cause the vicious swirls to spiral faster and faster as they move towards the shore. [Read More: Freakishly warm ocean water is a major reason why Hurricane Michael became the strongest storm in decades ] The powerful storm made for a messy scene on the plane On his flight, Zawislak said, the turbulence caused ocean buoys that crew keeps on board to fall into the aisle of the plane. While flying, he often takes notes on what's happening out the window, but Zawislak said he could barely keep his pen on the paper. ""It's not exactly the cleanest handwriting when it's that bumpy,"" he said. His crew even lost the use of their radar system at one point, though they're not sure whether that malfunction was due to turbulence. Nearby, an Air Force mission also flew through Michael, and the pilot thought it was his bumpiest flight on record too. Once planes make it through the fray and to the eye of a hurricane, things seem suddenly calm. The surrounding clouds make it look like one is inside a fluffy, narrow funnel. Often, meteorologists use the term ""stadium effect"" to describe the way a hurricane's eye looks to a plane flying through. But these clearings are typically far bigger than a stadium. Zawislak flew through the eye of Hurricane Florence, and said it was more than 15 miles wide at one point. Meteorologist and Air Force hurricane hunter Jeremy DeHart grabbed beautiful footage (below) of the eerie peace inside Hurricane Michael's eye. But DeHart said the rest of his flight was extremely turbulent. ""We got our clocks cleaned!"" he wrote. ""NOT FUN."" Flying through powerful storms like Michael could help improve future forcasts Perhaps the most rewarding part of the mission for Zawislak is yet to come. In the months ahead, he'll piece together the data his team collected in the air and from the sea. He'll examine the findings from his own flight into the hurricane along with all six other NOAA flights that flew into Michael. ""This might be one of the best-sampled rapid intensification events that we have on record,"" Zawislak said. The bumps and jumps feel worth it for that reason alone. ""Having the aircraft out there will allow us to learn something about rapid intensification that we didn't know before,"" he said. In the future, he hopes the data that hurricane-hunting planes collect from the air and sea will help unravel the mystery of how storms like Michael can become so violent and deadly so fast. That knowledge would help forecasters make better predictions about how strong a future storm will get. ""I'm happy to go out there and collect the measurements... so that people can become aware of what the threat of this storm is.""","Hurricane Michael was the strongest storm to hit the US in nearly 50 years, based on its low central pressure.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","Water from the Pungo River in Belhaven rushed in to this neighborhood trapping people in the wake of Hurricane Florence. USA TODAY High winds and storm surge from Hurricane Florence hits Swansboro North Carolina on Sept. 14, 2018. (Photo: Tom Copeland, AP) Although Hurricane Florence has made landfall in North Carolina, deadly and dangerous storm surge will plague the region for at least the next day or two. Storm surge, the rising mound of water that builds up and comes ashore during a hurricane, is often the deadliest and most destructive threat from the storms. Video from Belhaven, North Carolina, showed storm-surge flooding up to the window-level of a house early Friday morning. One report was of a 10-foot surge in New Bern, North Carolina, the National Weather Service said. Coastal flooding from storm surge may persist through multiple high-tide cycles into this weekend east of the center of Florence, the Weather Channel warned. The weather service warned that all coastal areas and tidally connected creeks, rivers, bays, and waterways are at risk of storm surge flooding. ""All evacuation orders from local officials should be followed because of this dangerous threat,"" the Weather Channel said. The greatest storm surge inundation is expected between Cape Fear and Cape Hatteras, including the Neuse and Pamlico Rivers and western Pamlico Sound, the National Hurricane Center said. A surge of up to 11 feet is possible in this area. ""The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,"" the National Hurricane Center said. The surge is also likely along portions of the South Carolina coast. The tidal cycle also affects storm surge, which is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tides. Storm tide is defined as the water level rise due to the combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide. ""This rise in water level can cause extreme flooding in coastal areas particularly when storm surge coincides with normal high tide,"" the hurricane center said, ""resulting in storm tides reaching up to 20 feet or more in some cases."" High tides in Wilmington, North Carolina on Friday will be mid-afternoon and again early Saturday morning. Significant beach erosion is also forecast for the southeastern U.S. coast, the weather service warned. Elevated water levels may persist for some time well after landfall in areas where onshore winds keep churning.

William Laws,"WASHINGTON (AP) — With a powerful hurricane bearing down on the southeast coast, President Donald Trump on Tuesday turned attention back to the federal government's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico a year ago, deeming it ""incredibly successful"" even though a recent federal report found that nearly 3,000 people died. The administration's efforts in Puerto Rico received widespread criticism. But after visiting the island last September, Trump said that Puerto Ricans were fortunate that the storm did not yield a catastrophe akin to the havoc wreaked by Hurricane Katrina along the Gulf Coast. All told, about 1,800 people died in that 2005 storm. Puerto Rico's governor last month raised the U.S. territory's official death toll from Hurricane Maria from 64 to 2,975. The storm is also estimated to have caused $100 billion in damage. ""I actually think it was one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about,"" Trump said Tuesday of the response in Puerto Rico, suggesting that it was made more difficult by the ""island nature"" of the storm site. The president praised the response to the series of storms that battered the United States last year, saying ""I think Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success. Texas we've been given A-pluses for. Florida we've been given A-pluses for.""

While defending the handling of the previous storm, he urged caution in regards to the new one bearing down on North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. ""The safety of American people is my absolute highest priority,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. ""We are sparing no expense. We are totally prepared. We are ready. We are ready as anybody has ever been."" The president, flanked by maps of the storm and the heads of the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Florence was unlikely to change course before it is expected to make landfall with 130 mph winds and potentially ruinous rains in the coming days. ""They haven't seen anything like what's coming at us in 25, 30 years, maybe ever,"" Trump said of the states in the storm's path. ""It's tremendously big and tremendously wet. Tremendous amount of water."" Florence was expected to blow ashore late Thursday or early Friday, then slow down and wring itself out for days, unloading 1 to 2½ feet of rain that could cause flooding well inland and wreak environmental havoc by washing over industrial waste sites and hog farms. North and South Carolina and Virginia ordered mass evacuations along the coast.

Jacob Shamsian,"A man from New Jersey vandalized Maine's famous 300-foot-wide ice disk in Presumpscot River Thursday, saying he wanted to turn it into a peace sign. 
 The enormous ice floe has been floating in Westbrook, Maine, since January 14. It's mesmerized residents with its ethereal beauty, and inspired conspiracy theories about aliens. 
 The disk stopped spinning earlier this month. Christopher Angelo, a New Jersey resident, took the opportunity to climb aboard and transform it for his own ends, trying to carve a peace sign out of it with a chainsaw and ax. 
 ""I'm an arborist, I'm a tree climber, it makes me uniquely qualified to do this because I use chainsaws, ropes, I'm making a giant peace sign,"" he told WGME. ""I want it to spin around so bad, and create that visual for people to see of peace making the world go around in Westbrook."" 
 Angelo has a history of staging public stunts, according to the Portland Press Herald. After Hurricane Sandy in 2013, he climbed aboard rides at damaged theme parks. 
 Angelo didn't succeed in carving out a peace sign, but he did cut out chunks and create a long crack through the center. The city of Westbrook has a time lapse recording showing the damage. 
 ""It isn't against the law to chop river ice,"" Westbrook Police Department Captain Sean Lally told the Portland Press Herald. ""Unusual? Yes. Why someone would come here from New Jersey to chop up an ice disk is beyond me. I do know that the river will continue to flow and the Maine winter is far from over, so Mr. Angelo might want to seek long-term accommodations if he intends to defy Mother Nature."" 
 Meanwhile, a second, smaller ice disk has formed. In Baxter State Park, there's one that's around 40 feet across. It's still spinning.
