Jon Hamilton,"Alan Dambach developed tremors that caused his hands to shake uncontrollably. His condition made it difficult to work on his family's tree farm in Fombell, Pa. Ross Mantle for NPR Alan Dambach was in his late 50s when he noticed how unsteady his hands had become. Over the next decade, his tremor got so bad he had difficulty eating with a spoon or fixing equipment at his family's tree farm in western Pennsylvania. ""I couldn't get nuts and bolts to work,"" he says. But it was his deteriorating handwriting that made Dambach decide he had to do something about his tremor. ""My signature was so bad, and my writing was just atrocious,"" he says. ""One day I was over at our business and I was writing an order. And one of my foremen said, 'Why don't you let me write that for you?' "" Dambach's problem wasn't a disease, like Parkinson's. He'd simply inherited genes that made his hands increasingly shaky as he got older. The condition is called essential tremor or familial tremor, and it affects more than 7 million people in the U.S. Dambach tried drugs, which helped temporarily. He also considered surgery to implant a device called a deep brain stimulator. But he didn't like the idea of an implanted device, or having wires run from his chest to his brain. ""I thought: no way,"" he says. ""This isn't going to work for me, I'm still too active."" Dambach decided to try a treatment at the University of Maryland Medical Center called focused ultrasound. The procedure sends sound waves directly to the part of the brain affecting his motor skills. Ross Mantle for NPR Then Dambach heard about a new treatment that uses sound waves to reduce tremors without traditional surgery. It's called focused ultrasound, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2016. But the treatment is only now becoming available at more than a handful of medical centers. Dambach was referred to Dr. Howard Eisenberg, chair of neurosurgery at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimor. And Eisenberg says Dambach's history is pretty typical of the people he treats. ""These people don't have just a tremor,"" he says. ""It's a disabling tremor. These are people who've had to actually change their lives."" Focused ultrasound reduces tremor by sending high frequency sound waves right through the skull to destroy specific areas of brain tissue. It's an outpatient procedure, but not a trivial one, Eisenberg says. ""Heating up part of your brain and killing brain cells seems invasive to me,"" Eisenberg says. ""But it doesn't have the same feeling to patients as surgery. There are no incisions. You don't go to the operating room."" Instead, patients are placed in an MRI scanner, which allows doctors to figure out which brain areas to zap. Then they are fitted with a helmet-like device that can focus sound waves on those areas. During Dambach's treatment, Eisenberg and his team would administer a burst of ultrasound, and then bring him out of the MRI tube to see how he was doing. ""They gave me a bottle of water to pretend I was drinking,"" he says. ""And every time I came out it shook less."" Studies show the treatment generally reduces tremors by at least half. Dambach saw his all but disappear. But any substantial reduction can be life changing, says Charlene Aldrich, a researcher who works with Eisenberg at the University of Maryland. She shows me several patients' efforts to trace a circular pattern with a pen before and after the treatment. ""You can see here they cannot draw a circle,"" Aldrich says, pointing to scribbles that look almost random. ""And here they follow the lines like you and I would do,"" she says. Focused ultrasound isn't the right treatment for everyone. So far, it is only being used to treat one side of the brain, which means it can only reduce the tremor in one hand. Also some people can't be treated at all because their skulls absorb too much of the sound energy. And, there are risks. Some patients experience numbness or problems with balance afterward. Finally, even though the procedure is approved by FDA, many insurers still don't cover the cost, which is about $40,000. Medicare covers the procedure in some states, but not others. After undergoing focused ultrasound, Dambach's tremors no longer affect his right hand. He continues to show some signs of shaking in his left hand. Ross Mantle for NPR For Dambach, though, focused ultrasound was the right call. He says by the end of the procedure, which took hours, he was exhausted. ""But the next day, I had to take the payroll to the banks and I had to sign them,"" he says. ""I just was so happy. My signature was back."" That was more than a year ago, and Dambach says his signing hand is still rock steady. So far, more than 1,000 essential tremor patients around the world have been treated with focused ultrasound, says Maurice Ferré, CEO of Insightec, the company that makes the device used to treat Dambach. But that number is likely to increase as more centers in the U.S. begin offering the procedure and more states approve Medicare payment for it. Right now, Medicare covers the treatment in 10 states, though coverage is pending in many more, Ferré says. Insightec plans to begin testing ultrasound treatment on both sides of the brain in tremor patients in the U.K. later this years, Ferré says. The goal is to reduce tremor in both hands, instead of just one. And in the U.S. the company is already testing the technology's ability to treat tremors in Parkinson's patients, Ferré says.",Tree farmer Alan Dambach's tremor got so bad he couldn't read his own signature.

David Pescovitz,"Musician Anna Henry suffered from essential tremor, a movement disorder that causes shaky hands. As the conditioned worsened, it interfered with her flute playing. So she underwent a surgical procedure called deep brain stimulation to cure it. The Texas Medical Center surgeons implanted a battery pack in her chest that delivers tiny voltages to the brain's thalamus, a key region responsible for controlling movement. She was kept awake during the operation, a common practice to test the device and avoid brain damage. The procedure worked. From the Texas Medical Center : The result was like flipping a switch. Prior to the surgery, Henry’s neurologist, Mya Schiess, M.D., of the Mischer Neuroscience Institute at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center and UTHealth, ran a few motor control tests. Henry could barely sign her name, let alone hold a pen. When handed a cup of water, her hand shook so intensely that the water splashed inside the cup. But after the electrodes were placed in her brain and the thalamus was stimulated, Henry’s hand was still and stable, without a single detectable tremor. When she signed her name a second time, each pen stroke was smooth and clean. Her handwriting was legible for the first time in decades. The surgical team handed Henry her flute to test if her hands were stable enough to play. As she remained on the operating bed, she lifted her flute to her mouth and treated everyone in the operating room not only to a sweet melody, but the joy of seeing her tremor disappear. “[Deep brain stimulation] works amazingly well,” Schiess said. “If you have a tremor that is truly interfering with hand function, lifestyle, head or voice, honestly, there isn’t a medicine out there that’s going to really put you in a better state.” For Henry, deep brain stimulation helped her get back to doing what she loves. Although her tremor had interfered with her quality of life and nearly put an end to her musical career, she refused to quit. “My folks lived through the [Great] Depression,” Henry said. “If there’s anything they taught me, it was that an obstacle is not something that stops you; it’s something you find a way around.”","Musician Anna Henry suffered from essential tremor, a movement disorder that causes shaky hands.

DECLAN WALSH,"Born into a farming family in a dusty village 100 miles north of Khartoum, the capital, Mr. al-Bashir served as a paratroop commander in the army. In 1989 he headed an Islamist junta that ousted Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi in a bloodless coup, Sudans fourth military takeover since independence in 1956. For the first decade of his rule, though, Mr. al-Bashir, was seen as a frontman for a more powerful force the cleric Hassan al-Turabi, a smooth-talking, Sorbonne-educated ideologue with sweeping ideas about embedding Shariah law deep in Sudans diverse society and institutions.
International jihadists flocked to Sudan in that period, among them Osama bin Laden, who bought a house in an upmarket Khartoum district and invested in agriculture and construction. In 1993 the United States blacklisted the Bashir government as an international sponsor of terrorism and imposed sanctions four years later.
In 1999, after a falling-out, Mr. al-Bashir outmaneuvered Mr. al-Turabi and cast him into prison. He turned back to the army to underwrite his authority, forging relationships that spanned the military, the security forces and the countrys tribal leadership.
Mr. al-Bashir assiduously attended the funerals and weddings of military officers, often sending presents of sugar, tea or dried goods to their families. He held an open house once a week where commissioned officers could drop in and meet with him, said Alex de Waal, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and an expert on Sudan.

Kerry Flynn,"Mount Agung, a volcano on Bali, erupted three times over the weekend, sending a thick ash cloud into the sky over the Indonesian island. Over the weekend, Mount Agung had its first major volcanic eruption since 1963. The latest eruption sent ash more than 2,000 meters (1.2 miles) into the air on Sunday, Bali's Regional Disaster Management Agency told CNN. The volcanic ash plume following the eruption reached an altitude of more than 4.7 miles and activity is still ongoing. SEE ALSO: Drone captures dramatic footage of erupting volcano in Japan The first eruption occurred around 4:30 a.m. ET on Saturday with more continuing over the following day. The disaster management agency advised residents to evacuate from 224 points around the island, according to CNN. The agency recommended no public activities around 3.5 to 4.5 miles from the peak of Mount Agung. At least 14 flights were cancelled, affecting more than 5,500 passengers, the Wall Street Journal reported. Indonesia issued its highest-level aviation warning for flights around Bali, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Mount Agung has been rumbling for months and has shown activity throughout the last week. An eruption began last week and was followed by a low-frequency tremor signal, according to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program. As of last week, the eruptions were only ""phreatic,"" meaning they did not include magma. But that appears to have changed over the weekend, and it is expected to continue to erupt. Last September, the volcano awoke for the first time in five years and led to an evacuation of 140,000 people from their homes.

Jamie Rigg,"An attempt at a working replica (Science &amp; Society Picture Library via Getty) Zhang Heng's invention was initially met with skepticism. His views on certain topics made him unpopular with some of his peers, and worse yet, his seismoscope was unproven. But as the story goes, several years later, a ball finally dropped. This in and of itself wasn't evidence it worked, of course -- no earthquake had been felt in the capital -- but days later a messenger arrived to report of a serious earthquake that originated hundreds of miles away, off to the west of Luoyang in the direction the now empty dragon mouth faced. Zhang Heng called his seismoscope Houfeng Didong Yi, meaning an ""instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth."" While many people of his time believed earthquakes had spiritual catalysts, he and a collection of other scholars were of the opinion the events were caused by winds and changes in air pressure -- bearing in mind this was way, way before the seed of plate tectonic theory sprouted in the early 20th century. In the centuries after Zhang Heng's death, other Chinese intellectuals were said have created successor seismoscopes of his design. Since nothing tangible survived the passage of time, however, historians of our era have struggled to reconcile these centuries-old accounts with a working replica of Zhang's device. Some even speculated it never existed. While the ornate nature of the seismoscope was well described, the exact mechanisms driving it weren't. Attempts to reinvent it in the 19th and 20th centuries proved unsuccessful. It remained unclear, for example, how an ancient pendulum design could be sensitive enough to detect earthquakes hundreds of miles away. Furthermore, how could the movement trigger just one mechanism and spare the others? In 2005, a group of seismologists and archaeologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced they had created a proven, functioning replica. In their version, the pendulum itself doesn't interact with any levers; instead, it's suspended above another ball perched atop a thin pedestal. When the pendulum swings, it nudges that central ball down one of eight channels, where it hits a trigger system that animates the external dragon mouth. We don't know this is exactly how Zhang's model worked, of course, but it shows that only a minor reinterpretation of how the seismoscope is described in historical texts can lead to the creation of a sensitive, direction-aware device. Even though Zhang's device is nearly two millennia old, the working principle behind it is still commonly used today. A popular form of modern seismograph uses exactly the same properties of inertia, whereby a static base and hanging pendulum move independently of each other when the ground shakes. Only nowadays the pendulum is a magnet, and the induced current its swinging produces in the conductive base is the record. Converting the fluctuations into a digital signal allows such seismographs to document tremor intensity, their timespan, etc. Zhang's invention noted the simple occurrence of an earthquake, hence the name seismoscope.","Modern seismographs are extremely sensitive pieces of equipment. By recording the slightest movements of laser light or magnets, these devices can detect the smallest of rumbles even when we can't sense them.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"At 29, Ellie Finch Hulme was diagnosed with a condition often associated with much older people - Parkinson's disease. She decided it wasn't going to stop her living her life the way she wanted to.
Ellie doesn't fit the stereotype of someone with Parkinson's Disease, as one of her recent tweets makes clear.
People are often shocked when they meet her for the first time, she says.
""I volunteer in a local charity shop occasionally around the kids and around my work and if I'm trembling, if I have to wrap something up - because anything can set off your tremor - someone will say something like, 'Is it your first day here?' And I'll be like, 'No I've got Parkinson's.'""
They expect someone with Parkinson's to be white-haired and stooping, but Ellie has young onset (or early onset) Parkinson's disease, and was diagnosed before she was 30.
How people react
A survey of more then 2,000 people for Parkinson's UK, to mark World Parkinson's day, found that 87% of people with the condition had faced discrimination or harassment. 
24% of people had been told they were ""too young"" to have Parkinson's
22% said their slurred speech or poor balance had been mistaken for drunkenness
32% said their less expressive facial expressions had been mistaken for unfriendliness
10% said they had been laughed at
More than half (57%) said they had avoided or cancelled social situations because of concerns about how others would react to them.

She first experienced symptoms when she was training for a half marathon in 2012. At first it was just a tremor in her left little finger, then her left leg started to go from under her as she ran.
Her GP suspected the problem was something called ""essential tremor"", a movement disorder, but Ellie wasn't convinced. After seeing a neurologist in April 2013 she underwent a series of scans and tests and was finally diagnosed with the condition that August.

 Ellie became engaged to her boyfriend, Tom, a month after her first appointment with a neurologist
By coincidence, in her work as a translator Ellie had been working on a text about one of the scans she herself was given. This led her to suspect she had Parkinson's before it was confirmed.
""I had a feeling that that's what it would be. But a lot of my friends were like, 'No, don't get ahead of yourself, it won't be that, it can't be that.'""
Ellie says it took a long time to accept that she had Parkinson's but one of the hardest experiences was having to break the news to friends and relatives.
""I think it was more difficult for friends and family to accept than it really was for me,"" she says.
Ellie and her fiance, Tom, had already planned to marry the following March and soon after returning from their honeymoon, Ellie realised she was pregnant.

""That was intentional,"" she says.
""We knew we wanted to have kids and we wanted to do it sooner rather than later. In no way was I prepared to sacrifice that because of this condition.""
Not many people with Parkinson's disease become pregnant. Although a third of people with the condition get it before the age of 65, only one in 20 get it below the age of 45, and only one in 100 below the age of 40, according to Prof Huw Morris, consultant neurologist at the Royal Free Hospital and professor of clinical neuroscience at University College London.
The symptoms - slower movements, stiffness and sometimes tremors - are caused by a loss of nerve cells in the brain, and a reduction in the amount of dopamine, the chemical in the brain that helps with movement.
Treatment for Parkinson's therefore includes dopamine replacement.
""We think that Levodopa, the main dopamine treatment, is probably safe in pregnancy, but it's difficult to know that,"" says Huw Morris.
Ellie says she felt extremely anxious throughout the whole of her pregnancy, even though the dose of her medication was reduced.
""It was scary. I was pretty concerned,"" she says. ""I just didn't know how the drugs were going to affect the foetus at all.""
In January 2015, Ellie went into labour on the day of her baby shower and gave birth to a son called Charlie three weeks early.
She took the decision not to breastfeed Charlie because of the risk that the drugs would be passed to him through her breast milk - she was told this was higher than the risk of them reaching the foetus had been.
""I found that absolutely heartbreaking,"" she says. ""I always thought that I would breastfeed and I was not able to and it took a long time to get over that.""
By this stage Ellie had a tremor in her left arm and hand, which made it harder to bottle feed her son. Holding him on her left side she would bottle feed him with her right hand, but it wasn't easy to keep her arm in a comfortable position - especially when she was doing it in public.
""Bath time was a bit scary,"" she says. ""But I used to do that when my husband was there.""
Ellie also struggled with some of the fiddlier baby clothes, such as doing up the poppers on Babygros or getting zips up. She buys shoes with Velcro fastenings to avoid problems with laces.
Twenty-two months after Charlie was born, in November 2016, Ellie gave birth to her daughter, Sophie.
""We were like, 'Let's just go for it, because I'm not going to get any better, so therefore it's probably better to just get through a second pregnancy sooner rather than later.' But obviously not too soon.""
She says her reaction to having two small children was probably the same as any parent's.
""It's quite kind of, 'Wow!' A lot of things to deal with, like getting my son weaned off his dummy and then starting his potty training. And obviously, having a newborn, it's a lot to cope with. But it's a lot for any parent,"" she says. ""I've tried not to let having Parkinson's really affect any of what I was doing with the kids when they were little.""
Ellie says her children know that she takes medication and her son, now four, has started to ask some questions.
""As he gets older and he's able to understand, and his empathy builds as he grows, I think that it will be easier for me to say, 'This is what doesn't work properly,'"" she says. ""But they've never once said to me, 'Mummy, why do you shake?'""
The speed at which the disease develops tends to be slower in people with early onset Parkinson's, says Huw Morris. Treatments are very effective, he says, but there is nothing that can stop it in its tracks.
Like Ellie, the actor Michael J Fox was diagnosed with young onset Parkinson's at the age of 29, and he's still acting occasionally in his late 50s.
Ellie says her hopes for the future are mostly the same as any person with children.
""I hope that my children understand all my decisions and the choice that my husband and I made to have them - and I'm pretty sure they will,"" she says.
""I do hope that I won't be a burden on them, that they won't see it like that, because one day I'll probably need to be cared for, and that's really quite difficult to say, to be honest.""
Help and information:
NHS: Parkinson's disease
Parkinson's UK
NICE: Parkinson's disease

Ellie says she does not spend each day wondering, 'What's my life going to be like?' but takes each day as it comes.
""I think that's the best way to be, to be positive and don't worry about what the future holds, either positive or negative, because you could get run over by a bus tomorrow and it would be totally unrelated to Parkinson's. It's just not worth worrying about.""
Ellie says it is frustrating people tend to associate Parkinson's with just one thing - tremors - and are unaware of other symptoms.
""I do have a lot of stiffness in my hand,"" she says. ""So at times when my medicine's wearing off I just can't raise my arm for example and my hand is completely stiff. People don't realise that is one of the main symptoms - and pain as well, and cramps.""
Rates of anxiety and depression are also higher in people with young onset Parkinson's disease, according to Huw Morris.
Ellie says the things that have helped her most with her condition are continuing to do plenty of exercise, connecting with other young people who live with Parkinson's and avoiding the temptation to compare herself to others - because each person is different. It's impossible to know whether her condition will progress faster, slower or at the same speed as someone else's.
""It's not like a death sentence,"" says Ellie. ""Hopefully I'll live a fulfilled life with this condition for many years.""

BeauHD,"The device, named the WAND, works like a ""pacemaker for the brain,"" monitoring the brain's electrical activity and delivering electrical stimulation if it detects something amiss. These devices can be extremely effective at preventing debilitating tremors or seizures in patients with a variety of neurological conditions. But the electrical signatures that precede a seizure or tremor can be extremely subtle, and the frequency and strength of electrical stimulation required to prevent them is equally touchy. It can take years of small adjustments by doctors before the devices provide optimal treatment.
WAND, which stands for wireless artifact-free neuromodulation device, is both wireless and autonomous, meaning that once it learns to recognize the signs of tremor or seizure, it can adjust the stimulation parameters on its own to prevent the unwanted movements. And because it is closed-loop -- meaning it can stimulate and record simultaneously -- it can adjust these parameters in real-time. WAND can record electrical activity over 128 channels, or from 128 points in the brain, compared to eight channels in other closed-loop systems. To demonstrate the device, the team used WAND to recognize and delay specific arm movements in rhesus macaques. The device is described in a study that appeared in Nature Biomedical Engineering.","Engineers at the University of California, Berkeley, have developed a new neurostimulator that can listen to and stimulate electric current in the brain at the same time, potentially delivering fine-tuned treatments for patients with diseases like epilepsy an…",2019-01-03T01:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slashdot.org'}",Wireless 'Pacemaker For the Brain' Could Offer New Treatment For Neurological Disorders,https://science.slashdot.org/story/19/01/02/226223/wireless-pacemaker-for-the-brain-could-offer-new-treatment-for-neurological-disorders,https://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/medicine_64.png?refresh=now,,Slashdot.org,tremor,1

Alessandra Potenza,"Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska, prompting a tsunami warning that forced people to flee to higher grounds in the middle of the night. Fortunately, the tsunami waves were less than a foot high, and the advisories were canceled a little after 4AM local time. So why was Alaska so lucky? Powerful quakes that happen out at sea are known to cause destructive tsunamis. In 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake in northeastern Japan triggered waves as high as 126 feet, killing nearly 20,000 people. In 2004, a similarly strong quake off the coast of Indonesia caused a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people. Alaska also has a history of strong earthquakes: in 1964, the state experienced the most powerful quake ever recorded in the US, a 9.2 magnitude tremor followed by a tsunami that killed over 100 people. “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes,” says Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey (USGS). “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes.” Earthquakes occur because the Earth’s crust is divided into plates. These plates can move smoothly against each other or become stuck. When they become stuck, they build up strain over time, until one day, the plates unstick, releasing energy that causes an earthquake. Just south of Alaska, the Pacific plate is sliding underneath the North American plate, an area called the subduction zone. That’s why the state is highly seismic, Blakeman tells The Verge. Last night’s earthquake generated because of all the strain building up on the subduction zone, but it did not occur exactly on a fault where the Pacific Ocean seafloor is sliding under the North American plate, Blakeman says. Instead, the quake occurred a little farther out, in a place where the fault is moving horizontally. This type of quake, called a strike-slip earthquake, is less likely to trigger large tsunamis, and this is probably why Alaska only saw waves of less than a foot, according to Blakeman. When earthquakes happen on the subduction zone itself, where one plate is pushing down while the other is going up, then high waves form. “To get a tsunami, you have to have substantial vertical movement on the seabed,” Blakeman says. Those types of earthquakes were responsible for the massive tsunamis in Japan and Indonesia. Aftershocks in Alaska could continue for weeks or months, Blakeman says. If the quakes generate from the same zone as last night, then large tsunamis should not be expected. But because the state sits by the Pacific-North America plate boundary, it’s normal that new earthquakes will happen in the future. When and where, exactly? That’s impossible to say. Earthquakes are so complicated that scientists aren’t able to predict them — at least not yet. “Since we can’t predict them, all we can do is be prepared,” Blakeman says.","Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska.",2018-01-23T16:15:13Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",A powerful earthquake in Alaska didn’t trigger a big tsunami — here’s why,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16922914/alaska-earthquake-tsunami-pacific-north-america-plate-boundary,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQqh3BMKCmEiuTLq3ign4Cnb9ag=/0x97:704x466/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10082687/earthquake.png,the-verge,The Verge,tremor,1

 The ash cloud is seen from the city of Catania, to the south of the volcano
Europe's most active volcano, Mount Etna in Sicily, erupted on Monday, with officials reporting more than 130 earthquakes of up to 4.0 in magnitude.
The Mount Etna observatory said lava had spewed from a new fracture near its south-eastern crater.
A local vulcanologist said it was Etna's ""first flank eruption"" in more than a decade.
Volcanic ash covered nearby villages, while planes into Catania airport had to be halted temporarily.
A large explosion was felt close to Etna during the morning.
A video filmed 2,500m (8,200 ft) up the 3,350m volcano showed the fast spread of ash. People on the mountainside were told to escape quickly.
Catania airport said later that the airspace had been reopened to allow four planes to land per hour and that the situation was being monitored on a regular basis.
Italy's INGV volcanology institute said that during a three-hour period from 08:50 (07:50 GMT) on Monday more than 130 earthquakes took place.
The biggest tremor of 4.0 magnitude was on the north-east side of Etna near Piano Pernicana, while another of similar magnitude was felt on the northern flank.
That was followed by intense eruptions from the volcano's new south-east crater.

The drugs, imported in capsule form, are designed to treat essential tremor (ET), a neurological disorder that causes involuntary and uncontrollable shaking that can make it difficult for patients to perform every day tasks like eating, drinking, or writing. It’s expected to begin in early 2019. ""Tilray is proud to support this crucial research,"" Catherine Jacobson, Tilray’s director of clinical research, said in a press release. ""If this study can identify cannabinoids as a potential treatment for patients suffering from essential tremor, we can conduct further research and potentially provide alternative effective methods of relief for the high numbers of patients with ET."" Currently, ET is treated with drugs originally developed to treat high blood pressure, seizures, and even Botox. Tilray is also involved in four other trials to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a form of epilepsy, brain cancer, and side-effects of chemotherapy. Tilray’s stock price has soared more than 680% — with Tuesday's gains — since its initial public offering in July. And while Wall Street analysts remain optimistic for the company’s outlook, the rally could be unsustainable.

Reuters news agency reports that police are escorting aid convoys to prevent supplies being stolen. President Joko Widodo has welcomed offers of international help. On a visit to the region, the president urged a ""day and night"" effort to rescue survivors.

Trucks arrived with bodies wrapped in orange, yellow and black bags. They were dragged into the grave and motorised diggers poured earth on top. But many people are still looking for missing loved ones. Adi told AFP he was hugging his wife by the beach in Palu when the tsunami struck, and has not seen her since.

She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. ""We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live."" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies. A few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: ""They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer."" Rows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood. People's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open. Why was the tsunami so destructive? The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami. The earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis. A sophisticated tsunami warning system was put in place across the whole Pacific region after the 2004 disaster, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people. A tsunami warning was issued after the earthquake hit on Friday, but many people in Palu did not receive alerts because of power cuts caused by the tremor. There were also no sirens located along the coast. Videos show people screaming as waves 6m (20ft) high power over the beach - where a festival was being set-up - sweeping up everything in their path. Indonesia, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries, lies on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide and many of the world's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The epicentre of the earthquake struck near where the miners were working Four miners have died after an earthquake caused a cave-in at a South African gold mine. The miners were among 10 rescued from Sibanye-Stillwater's Masakhane mine, west of Johannesburg, after the incident on Thursday. Three miners remain trapped, two of whom are still unaccounted for, the company said. South Africa is a leading gold producer, but the industry has often been accused of a poor safety record. This is the second large-scale incident at mines controlled by Sibanye-Stillwater in recent months. Back in February, 955 miners became trapped underground for more than 24 hours after a storm knocked out the power, and the back-up generators failed to work. On that occasion, no-one died. But not long afterwards, two of the company's employees were killed at a different mine, news agency AFP reports. This latest incident took place after ""the epicentre [of the quake struck] very close to where the miners were working,"" Sibanye-Stillwater spokesman James Wellsted told AFP. South Africa's largest trade union, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), has criticised the company, saying in a statement it was ""alarmed by the deteriorating and poor safety record of Sibanye-Stillwater"".",Rescue efforts continue at a South African mine after tremor strikes west of Johannesburg.,2018-05-04T09:40:30Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",South Africa gold miners die after earthquake strikes,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-44003070,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A23E/production/_99843514_mining.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tremor,1
XINHUA,"SAN FRANCISCO: Scientists from University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) on the western US coast have invented a wireless controlled neurostimulator that could provide fine-tuned treatments to patients with diseases like epilepsy and Parkinsons.
UC Berkeley researchers worked out a wireless artifact-free neuromodulation device (WAND) that is able to listen and stimulate with an electric current in the brain at the same time, a study that was published in Nature Biomedical Engineering on Monday (Tuesday in Manila) said.
The closed-loop device works like a pacemaker for the brain by automatically monitoring the brains electrical activity and delivering electrical stimulation if it detects something gone awry.
With the ability to stimulate and record simultaneously, WAND can prevent the unwanted movements of brain current by adjusting in real time the stimulation parameters on its own if it detects signs of a tremor or a seizure.
WAND outperforms previous similar devices that are effective in preventing debilitating tremors or seizures in patients with various neurological conditions, as it can take several years for doctors to constantly adjust for optimal electrical stimulation to stop extremely subtle electrical signatures preceding a seizure or a tremor.
The process of finding the right therapy for a patient is extremely costly and can take years, Rikky Muller, assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley, said.
WAND beats other closed-loop systems in that it is capable of recording electrical activity over 128 channels, or from 128 points in the brain.
Muller said he and his team want to incorporate learning into their closed-loop platform to build intelligent devices in the future, with the aim to determine the most optimal treatment for patients of neurological disorders.

,"At a Glance A 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred Friday evening local time on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The quake triggered a tsunami, according to Indonesia's geophysics agency. A 6.1 magnitude foreshock struck earlier in the day, killing at least one person. A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi Friday evening just hours after a powerful, deadly foreshock, apparently triggered a tsunami that hit the coast minutes later. The main tremor struck at 6:02 p.m. local time Friday evening (6:02 a.m. EDT) about 35 miles northeast of Donggala, Indonesia a town of about 300,000 according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Shortly after, a tsunami warning was issued by Indonesia's geophysics agency, then lifted. It's believed the tsunami, confirmed by local agencies to be up to 10 feet tall, struck Donggala and Palu, a coastal town of about 330,000 after the alert was cancelled. Hary Tirto Djatmiko, a spokesman for the agency, confirmed to the Associated Press that a tsunami occurred and more information would be released once it was gathered. ""Based on historical data and tsunami modelling, this earthquake is not capable of generating a tsunami affecting the Indian Ocean region,"" said the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysical Agency of Indonesia. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency, told a local TV station that houses were carried away by the tsunami and families were missing, but darkness hindered the search Friday night. ""The situation is chaotic, people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore,"" Dwikorita Karnawati, head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency, told BBC.com. There were at least 10 foreshocks and aftershocks recorded at magnitude 5 or stronger on Friday. The main quake was relatively shallow in preliminary observations just 6.2 miles deep, according to the USGS. Earlier Friday, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake killed one person, injured several others and damaged dozens of homes, according to the AP. ""It happened while we still have difficulties in collecting data from nine villages affected by the first quake,"" an official with Akris, the local disaster agency, told the AP. ""People ran out in panic."" The tremors came a month after a large earthquake killed as many as 500 on the island of Lombok, southwest of Sulawesi. The 6.9 magnitude quake, which struck Aug. 5, was the deadliest tremor of 2018 so far.","The Weather Channel Indonesia Earthquake, Tsunami Causes Major Damage on Sulawesi Island The Weather Channel A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi Friday evening just hours after a powerful, deadly foreshock, apparently …",2018-09-29T03:00:42Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Weather.com'}","Indonesia Earthquake, Tsunami Causes Major Damage on Sulawesi Island - The Weather Channel",https://weather.com/en-IN/india/news/news/2018-09-28-indonesia-earthquakes-sulawesi,https://s.w-x.co/928bridge.jpg,,Weather.com,tremor,1
Reuters,"MATARAM, Indonesia (Reuters) ― A fresh tremor of 6.3 magnitude struck the Indonesian holiday island of Lombok, the U.S. Geological Survey said on Sunday, after an earthquake killed more than 430 people there earlier this month. USGS estimated the depth of the latest tremor at 7.9 km (4.9 miles) and said the epicentre was on the north-eastern shoulder of the island at the foot of Mount Rinjani. There was no tsunami warning, and authorities were still awaiting word on casualties. Lombok, which lies just east of Bali, the southeast Asian country’s most famous tourist destination, has been rocked by a series of quakes and aftershocks since July 29, including a 6.9-magnitude tremor on Aug. 5. The latest tremor sent shudders through residents. “It was very strong. All the lights went out,” Asmaatul Husna told Reuters at a shopping mall where she works in Lombok ’s main town, Mataram. Disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said there were no reports so far of casualties or damage. “We are still monitoring,” he told TVOne television. He said that activity on the island was normal and Mount Rinjani, where hundreds of trekkers were stranded after the July 29 quake, was closed and there were no tourists there. Lombok suffered damage running to more than $342 million from the Aug. 5 earthquake, authorities said last week, putting the death toll at more than 430. More than 350,000 people fled their homes after that quake to shelter in government-provided tents or makeshift structures in open fields. Authorities said aid was slow getting to some of the hardest-hit areas as they are remote.

,"A magnitude 5.3 earthquake was reported Thursday afternoon off the coast of California near Los Angeles. It was the largest earthquake to strike the Channel Islands region since a 6.0 temblor in 1981, Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson told the Los Angeles Times. No significant damage has been reported after a magnitude 5.3 earthquake in the Channel Islands region off the Southern California coast, but some bricks fell from a chimney at a historic ranch on one of the islands, according to the Associated Press. Channel Islands National Park spokeswoman Yvonne Menard told AP that the bricks fell Thursday at a ranch building on Santa Cruz Island that dates to the 1860s. Menard says the quake was felt by visitors and staff on the island. The quake's epicenter was 17 miles from Santa Cruz Island, which is largely unpopulated but does have some staff and is visited by campers. Authorities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties did not report any immediate damage.

Associated Press,"LOS ANGELES - A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck Thursday under the ocean off Southern California and was felt widely along the mainland coast, but there were no reports of damage except to a chimney on one of the Channel Islands. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake occurred at 12:29 p.m. in the Channel Islands region, about 38 miles (61 kilometers) southwest of the mainland city of Ventura. Some bricks fell from a chimney at an 1860s ranch on Santa Cruz Island, but no one was hurt, said Yvonne Menard, spokeswoman for Channel Islands National Park. The quake's epicenter was 17 miles (27 kilometers) from Santa Cruz Island, which is largely unpopulated but does have some staff and is visited by campers. Authorities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties did not report any immediate damage. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it went into ""earthquake mode"" and firefighters from all 106 of its firehouses began surveys of their territories, including bridges, dams, large buildings and power lines. ""We currently have no reports of damage or injuries,"" spokeswoman Margaret Stewart said. Scientists at the California Institute of Technology's seismology laboratory in Pasadena said the earthquake warning system under development for the West Coast gave about 10 seconds of warning before shaking arrived. Earthquakes of such size usually occur about once a year in Southern California, although the most recent one was in 2014, according to veteran seismologist Lucy Jones, recently retired from the USGS. The 96-square-mile (248-square-kilometer) Santa Cruz Island is the largest in the chain of eight Channel Islands, five of which are in the national park. Most of Santa Cruz Island, including the historic ranch, is owned by The Nature Conservancy, which cooperatively manages the island with the Park Service.","CBS News Los Angeles earthquake: Magnitude 5.3 quake strikes off California ABC15 Arizona LOS ANGELES - A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck Thursday under the ocean off Southern California and was felt widely along the mainland coast, but there were no reports …",2018-04-06T03:09:32Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Abc15.com'}",Los Angeles earthquake: Magnitude 5.3 quake strikes off California - ABC15 Arizona,https://www.abc15.com/news/national/los-angeles-earthquake-magnitude-53-quake-strikes-off-california,https://mediaassets.abc15.com//photo/2011/09/19/earthquake_20110919135506_900_675.JPG,,Abc15.com,tremor,1
"Sarah Rahal, Mark Hicks","Amherstburg is east of Grosse Ile. (Photo: USGS) A small earthquake rattled parts of Ontario and southeast Michigan on Thursday night and sent startled residents outside and online looking for answers. A magnitude 3.6 quake originated near Amherstburg, Ontario, just across the Detroit River, about 15.5 miles south of Detroit, according to the United States Geological Survey, and was felt at least 40 miles away in parts of Downriver and Dearborn. After the rumbles radiated across the region, those who felt it posted reaction on social media and websites, some saying they thought it was lightning, an explosion or a crash on an interstate. “It was so weird &amp; scary!” one user wrote on Twitter. “I heard a boom noise and then 3 seconds later I felt a tremor beneath my feet.” The temblor occurred about 8 p.m., said Ian Lee, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “They’re relatively rare, but it’s not the first time there’s been an earthquake in the area,” Lee said. The last earthquake that struck Michigan — not counting the 2.0 quake that followed a meteor strike in Metro Detroit in January — was a 4.0 in Galesburg, near Kalamazoo on May 2, 2015, he said. The USGS considers 3-3.9 a minor earthquake, “felt quite noticeably by persons indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings,” according to its website. “Many people do not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing motor cars may rock slightly. Vibrations similar to the passing of a truck.” Soon after the first trembling began, comments on CSEM-EMSC, an independent scientific organization and provider of real-time earthquake warnings, flooded the site. “It was loud like thunder that kept rumbling not a lot of shaking just vibrating,” said a post from Amherstburg. “Very loud, dogs freaked. Lasted maybe 30 seconds total,” said another post. Remarks from Woodhaven said residents felt the quake in their homes. Residents from Trenton reported shaking for 30 seconds. “I’ve been in a few Earthquakes from the Michigan fault line,” another post said. “This one felt different. We could hear it coming, before we felt it, which I don’t ever remember hearing before. Wife actually commented: “What’s that noise?”... then we felt the tremor go through the house.” The relative rarity of a quake alarmed many area residents. One user likened the shaking to feeling “like someone hit the store with a truck.” Another wondered if the rumbles came from the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant in southeast Michigan. “The epicenter was a few KM from our house,” the user tweeted. “Very sharp and loud initial Bang. Followed by a minute or two of low booms and rumbles. Thought Fermi 2 blew up.” The Monroe County plant is run by DTE Energy Co. The facility was not affected by the temblor, said Je’well Pearson, a utility spokeswoman. “It’s all quiet over here.” Thursday’s heaving was the second uncommon disturbance to ripple through southeast Michigan in 2018. The meteor hit Earth around 8:10 p.m. Jan. 16, sparking a 2.0 magnitude earthquake in the Detroit area, the USGS reported. Meteorite hunters soon went on a spree to find pieces of the fireball. srahal@detroitnews.com Read or Share this story: https://detne.ws/2vw7OT6","The Detroit News Magnitude 3.6 earthquake hits near Windsor The Detroit News A magnitude 3.6 earthquake rattled parts of Ontario and Downriver in Michigan on Thursday night, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

https://www.facebook.com/jlachenbach,"Yes, that was an earthquake. It wasn’t much of one. People conceivably have sneezed harder than the violence produced by Thursday afternoon’s earthquake. But it was unusual, centered in the normally quiescent state of Delaware, and it could be felt as far as the nation’s capital and its Virginia suburbs. The tremor occurred at 4:47 p.m., centered about 6 miles northeast of Dover, Del., and about 5 miles deep. The U.S. Geological Survey gave varying estimates of the earthquake’s magnitude, at one point rating it as high as a 5.1 but later downgrading it to a 4.1 — a modest event that did not appear to cause any damage, much less fatalities. The Delaware Emergency Management Agency told the Dover Post that there were no reports of damage or injuries. Geophysicist Dale Grant of the USGS said an earthquake in Delaware is “exceptionally rare.” The earthquake was felt across a broad swath of the Washington-New York corridor, and into the Hudson River Valley and parts of Connecticut and Long Island, according to the USGS “Did You Feel It?” page. Almost everywhere, the shaking was reported by residents to be either “weak” or “light.” In comments posted to The Post’s Capital Weather Gang blog, people in and around Washington reported rattling windows or the sense that a big truck had just passed down the street. A reader in Hyattsville wrote, “ My toddler and I looked at each other like ‘what was that?!?’ House shuddered for about a second, 3 shakes. At first I thought the mailman had thrown a big package onto our porch (nope). Then I thought maybe a tree branch had fallen in our backyard (nope). The street was quiet, so not construction or a big truck or a low plane flying overhead. I correctly deduced it must have been an earthquake!” [ Magnitude 4.1 earthquake near Dover, Del., rattles Mid-Atlantic ] Closer to the epicenter, the earthquake was more dramatic. A reader in downtown Dover wrote, “ felt house shake violently….thought it was a gas explosion.” The magnitude scale is logarithmic, and a 5.0 magnitude event is 10 times more powerful than 4.0. The Aug. 23, 2011, earthquake centered near Mineral, Va., which damaged the Washington Monument and the National Cathedral, had an estimated magnitude of 5.8, and was one of the three strongest quakes east of the Rocky Mountains in the last century. There is no known fault associated with this earthquake. The hazard maps produced by the USGS do not show Delaware having a significant seismic hazard. Those maps may have to be revised as a result of Thursday’s tremor. There has been debate, sometimes quite acrimonious, within the scientific community about the usefulness of hazard maps, because earthquakes often happen in places of no known seismic hazard, or the ground shakes with greater intensity than had been imagined. The East Coast has a limited history of major earthquakes, but experts say that citizens should not assume they are free of seismic hazard. Charleston, S.C., was hit by a devastating earthquake in 1886 that killed 110 people. Indeed, New York City is considered highly vulnerable over the long term because so many masonry structures lack the kind of reinforced steel that is required in places with more of a known earthquake risk.

At least 844 people are confirmed to have died in the disaster, but the number is expected to rise as remote areas are reached. The aid and rescue operation is being slowed by damaged infrastructure and continuing strong aftershocks. There are fears some survivors may still be trapped under the rubble. Media caption Tsunami survivor: ""I was hugging my wife, but when the wave came... I immediately lost her"" The bodies of the students were found in the Sigi district, just outside Palu, which was struck by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami on Friday. Aid workers told BBC they were still in the process of retrieving the bodies, and were being hampered by mud. ""The mud conditions in that area are terrible, we have to walk about 1.5 hours to reach [the mudslide area], that makes it very difficult,"" Ridwan Sobri, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross told the BBC. Mr Sobri said the identities and ages of the students could not yet be confirmed. According to AFP, 86 students had initially been reported missing from a Bible camp in the Jonooge Church Training Centre in Sigi Biromaru. It is unclear if the students whose bodies have been found belong to the same group. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rescue workers are now trying to reach more remote regions Blocked roads, a damaged airport and broken telecommunications have made it difficult to bring help into the affected area, and impossible to contact more remote regions. With hospitals damaged, injured people have been treated in the open and at least one military field hospital has been set up. The military has taken over the airport to fly aid in, and injured people and other evacuees out. Media caption Indonesia quake looter: 'We need to eat' With supplies limited, people have been raiding damaged shops for food, water and medicine.

"USA TODAY, Kristin Lam, USA TODAY","Officials told CNN no deaths, serious injuries or structural damage to buildings were reported after the earthquake. Video provided by Newsy Newslook Marty Thurman with Granite construction inspects a crack in the road at the International Airport Road offramp on southbound Minnesota Blvd., in Anchorage, Alaska, Friday, Nov. 30, 2018. A state official says Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is open and operating at reduced capacity with delayed flights following back-to-back earthquakes. (Photo: Loren Holmes, AP) Major road repairs take more than just a few days. Unless you're the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. A week after a major earthquake rattled Alaska, a magnitude-7.0 tremor that's been followed by more than 3,000 aftershocks, the state's transportation department has become the envy of a nation for the speed of its work even if its repairs aren't permanent. Department spokesperson Shannon McCarthy told USA TODAY on Thursday that crews repaired most major road damage within four days with before and after photos of an off-ramp near Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport emerging as a social media sensation. The photos, shared on Facebook by Alaska Tour &amp; Travel, had garnered 1,100 comments and been shared more than 17,000 times as of Thursday night. ""Wow!! Other states could certainly learn from this. Way to go Alaska!!"" one person wrote. ""That is unbelievably awesome! Hooray for the Alaskan people! Wish repairs went that fast in Texas,"" another Facebook user said. ""It would take California years to get this done,"" another posted. The DOT's work, though, isn't done. The repairs completed since the Nov. 30 earthquake, in unfavorable winter conditions, are temporary solutions to avoid transit complications and crews will redo the majority of their work in the summer to ensure long-term sustainability, McCarthy said. It took about 72 hours of around-the-clock work to restore that northbound off-ramp near the airport, McCarthy said. A total of 14 people worked the project: seven laborers, five truck drivers and two project engineers. It was the first ramp that the department began reconstructing, with workers on-site just three hours after the quake. Crews faced freezing rain, light snow, high winds and temperatures that dropped to the high 20s. Usually, Alaska only does construction from May through September when conditions are more favorable for long-lasting repairs. The biggest challenges, McCarthy said, lied in the asphalt and frozen soil. No asphalt plants run during non-peak months because cold temperatures solidify the oil while rain and snow add moisture. So, instead, a department worker called a contractor to start reheating asphalt two hours after the earthquake, McCarthy said. Because areas of the road sunk and cracked apart, workers had to grind up the damaged asphalt, remove bad material, bring new material and compact the frozen soil. Then they paved and painted it. It reopened at 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, with the southbound exit for the airport opening an hour or two later. In the summer, McCarthy said construction crews would typically need a full two months for a similar project. Since Fridays earthquake, DOT&amp;PF employees and Alaska contractors have worked tirelessly to re-establish essential transportation links, Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement. Regardless of the challenges, they have committed to finding solutions in record time. Emergency declarations from the president and the governor, McCarthy said, expedited repairs. Support from the Federal Highway Administration also helped, as well as planning conscious of how Alaska gets more earthquakes than any other state. ""We're all really pleased that we were all able to come together and anticipate what our challenges were early on during the disaster,"" McCarthy said. ""Within that first hour or two, we were really anticipating what we were going to need in five days."" The department is continuing repairs to smaller damaged spots, including ruptures that shut down a lane. Throughout the winter, it will also monitor temporary repairs.

Graham Rapier,"REUTERS/Nir Elias Tilray, one of the largest Canadian marijuana companies, said Tuesday that it had successfully shipped a CBD product to Australia for treatment of children with epilepsy at three hospitals in Victoria. CBD is one of the nonpsychoactive compounds found in cannabis. The company's stock surged 17% following the announcement, breaking a three-day losing streak for the $8.7 billion company. It's the second round of medical cannabis exporting by Tilray to the Australian state under the government's ""compassionate access"" scheme, which first treated 29 critically-ill patients in March 2017. The patients were the first in Victoria to legally access marijuana-derived medicines. Similar export announcements by Tilray last week — involving treatment of Essential Tremor (ET) in California — also sparked a rally in shares, before falling 53% from their September 19 high of more than $119 apiece. Wall Street remains concerned abut stretched valuations following the stock's more than 500% surge since its July initial public offering, giving it an average price target of $62 — implying a possible drop of 57%. One prominent short-seller, Andrew Left of Citron Research, compared the rally in cannabis names to the cryptocurrency craze of early 2018: ""These stock prices are equivalent to bitcoin mania – although it is even more ridiculous than bitcoin,"" he said on September 12, when Tilray shares were trading even lower than where they were on Tuesday.

Will Martin,"Britain's Chancellor Alistair Darling leaves the Treasury to go to the House of Commons to deliver his pre-budget report, in central London November 24, 2008. REUTERS/Stephen Hird Britain came within hours of ""the breakdown of law and order"" on the day the government was forced to bail out RBS at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis, Britain's chancellor at the time, Alistair Darling told Business Insider. Darling, now a member of the House of Lords said that there were genuine concerns prior to the bail out of RBS in October 2008, that the collapse of the bank could lead to violence in Britain's streets. ""Gordon [Brown] and I were faced with the imminent collapse of what was then the world's biggest bank, we were very clear that if RBS had collapsed, it would have brought down the entire system with it,"" Darling told Business Insider in an interview. Had the government failed to bail RBS out, Darling said, it ""would have had to close its doors, switch off the cash machines."" That in turn, Darling said, would have caused ""complete panic"" among the British public. ""I think you'd have had complete panic with people realising they couldn't get their money,"" he said. ""If you can't get your money you can't buy food, you can't buy petrol etc. There was a grave risk of going from an economic crisis to a political crisis, where you have a breakdown of law and order. We were that close to the brink."" RBS was the biggest beneficiary of the British government's near £40 billion bailout programme during the crisis, which sought to stop the UK's major lenders from going under. Nearly 10 years after the bailout, RBS is still majority owned by the British taxpayer. Darling described the morning before the bailout was announced as the ""scariest moment"" of the crisis, when he received a call from RBS chairman Tom McKillop while attending a meeting of European finance ministers. McKillop told Darling that RBS was ""haemorrhaging money, and asked what we were going to do about it. I said 'We've got a plan ready to go, how long can you last?'"" ""He said: 'Until the beginning of the afternoon' which was about three hours away. That was probably my scariest moment. You think about these things, you game plan them, but when someone rings you up and says its happened, it is scary. It sent a tremor down my back."" The government's plan to part-nationalise RBS — as well as Lloyds and HBOS — ultimately worked, with the lenders able to weather the crisis and ultimately come out of the other side without threatening the entire financial system, but leaving significant scars. Having been made chancellor in June 2007, Darling said he first realised that a major crisis could be on his way while on holiday on the Spanish island of Majorca with his family during August of that year. ""I was sent down to the local supermarket to get the rolls and the papers. My friend noticed they had an FT, so I bought it to see what was going on."" While reading the FT, Darling saw ""coverage of the fact that a French bank [BNP Paribas] had stopped trading in two of its funds."" BNP froze withdrawals from three investment funds after U.S. subprime mortgage losses caused major market falls. ""The complete evaporation of liquidity in certain market segments of the US securitization market has made it impossible to value certain assets fairly regardless of their quality or credit rating,"" the bank said at the time.","Britain came within hours of the breakdown of law and order during the 2008 financial crisis.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck near the northernmost tip of Haiti late on Saturday, injuring a number of people and causing some damage to buildings including an auditorium that collapsed, authorities and media reported. The quake struck about 12.3 miles (20 kms), west-northwest of the port of Port-de-Paix, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. Local media reported at least one death. The quake was one of the strongest to hit Haiti since a 7.0 magnitude quake struck near the capital Port-au-Prince in 2010, killing thousands of people in the impoverished Caribbean country. In a post on Twitter, Haiti’s President Jovenel Moise urged people to remain calm after the civil protection agency said the quake caused injuries and panic in northern towns. Le Nouvelliste newspaper said one person died when an auditorium collapsed in the town of Gros Morne, and that detainees were released from a police holding cell that was damaged.

Max A. Cherney,"The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has signed off on cannabis cultivator Tilray Inc.’s plan to import a marijuana product from Canada to test its effectiveness at treating a disorder that affects millions of Americans. The DEA’s signoff is the final regulatory hurdle Tilray TLRY, +10.22% needed for a clinical trial of the medication’s effects on essential tremor, a neurological movement disorder. Tilray, the first pot producer to go public on Nasdaq, is testing for marijuana’s potential efficacy for different diseases, but its other four studies are taking place in Canada, Spain and Australia, in part because of U.S. federal prohibition of the drug. “There is no good treatment for essential tremor,” Tilray clinical research director Catherine Jacobson said. “The ultimate goal, what we want to know, is we want to understand whether cannabinoids might be a good treatment.” Don’t miss: For Canadian marijuana investors, coming to U.S. is a ‘crapshoot’ that can end in lifetime ban Tilray said it is providing the formulation for the trial in capsule form that will let researchers test an “investigational drug product” that contains cannabidiol, or CBD, and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the latter of which is the psychoactive component in cannabis. The trial at the University of California, San Diego, is expected to kick off in 2019 and is backed by Tilray and the International Essential Tremor Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides education and funds research surrounding essential tremor. Initially, 16 people will participate, and Jacobson said that if the study is successful, it would lead to larger testing groups. Jacobson says there is a “good scientific rationale” for testing whether cannabinoids can treat essential tremor and that patients have been reporting for some time that taking some form of cannabis has improved their quality of life. See also: Weed beer is near, and it’s gonna get weird This clinical trial is part of a larger effort to determine “how to target therapies for specific symptoms,” Jacobson said. Questions around dosing, efficacy and safety have all essentially been left up to patients to determine on their own. The research will be overseen by neurologist Fatta Nahab at UCSD’s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research. Nahab had been searching for a company that could produce a cannabis-based medicine that can treat essential tremor and meet Food and Drug Administration standards, Jacobson said. Tilray went public in July at $17 a share and closed Monday at $120.19, roughly a sixfold increase. The S&amp;P 500 index SPX, -0.56% has gained 3.6% during the same period. Short sellers have taken a considerable position in Tilray stock, with $381 million in short interest, according to research from S3 Partners, which also said the stock has become very expensive to short, with borrow fees ranging from 450% to 600% on Monday.

Laignee Barron,"Rescuers are scrambling to reach hundreds of trekkers stranded on a mountain in Indonesia after a massive earthquake triggered landslides. Early Sunday morning, a 6.4-magnitude quake rocked Lombok Island in Indonesia’s southeast, killing at least 14 people and injuring another 160. Not far from the epicenter, Mount Rinjani was hit with slides that blocked off escape routes, the BBC reports. Rescuers evacuated more than 800 tourists from the mountain, according to the Associated Press. Helicopters have been dispatched to search for another 266 who remain trapped. A Malaysian climber who was on a hiking trip to Lombok is reportedly among those killed. The tremor rattled the popular tourist destination just before 7 am local time, damaging thousands of homes. While the epicenter was located in Mataram, in northern Lombok, the quake was felt further afield, including 25 miles west in Bali. Dozens of aftershocks rippled through the area leading to falling debris and toppled concrete, which the country’s disaster agency said caused most of the fatalities. Indonesia’s meteorology and geophysics agency said it recorded over 130 aftershocks. “The tremors were strong – I noticed waves in the hotel pool,” BBC Marathi journalist Vinayak Gaikwad said from Gili Trawangan Island, about 4 miles away from the epicenter. “Thirty minutes later there was the first strong aftershock. The locals were worried because many of their structures are made from wood and bamboo,” he added. The quake triggered blackouts in at least two districts. Located in the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire,” a chain of volcanoes and fault lines, Indonesia is particularly prone to seismic activity.

https://www.facebook.com/KaylenSmallGlobal,"The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) has ordered Vesta Energy Ltd. to suspend its operations at a well site near Sylvan Lake on Tuesday after Monday’s earthquake.
AER said Vesta contacted the regulator on March 4 at 6:20 a.m. saying that seismic activity was detected due to hydraulic fracturing (also known as fracking) at the site. AER said that Vesta had shut down fracking right away.
Fracking involves pumping chemicals and sand underground to break up rocks to help get oil and natural gas flowing.

Erik Kuleba, AER’s director of environment and operational performance, said that a release of substances defined in the order as “vibrations and the release of energy” has occurred and that substances “have caused, are causing or may cause an adverse effect.”
The order said Kuleba considers it “necessary to suspend the well in order to protect the public and the environment.”
The regulator said the Calgary-based company must submit a report of all seismic activity in the area since April and specific fracturing data for the well site from Jan. 29 to Monday. It has also ordered Vesta to file a plan to eliminate or reduce future seismic activity from fracturing.

Jennifer Earl,"Researchers from the San Diego Natural History Museum and the non-profit Terra Peninsular were scratching their heads when they found unfamiliar rodents in traps they placed around a field in Baja California. They were intending to study rodent populations in the area — but instead made a rare discovery. The San Quintin kangaroo rat was last spotted in 1986. Nearly a decade later, the creature was added to the endangered species list by the Mexican government, the San Diego Natural History Museum said in a statement online. Scientists suspected the 5-inch rodents went extinct. They searched for the creatures for decades but always came up empty-handed. Now they're scrambling to come up with a plan to increase the animal's population. “Not only is this discovery a perfect example of the importance of good old-fashioned natural history field work, but we have the opportunity to develop a conservation plan based on our findings,” Scott Tremor, the museum's mammalogist, said in a statement. “The ability to take our research and turn it into tangible conservation efforts is thrilling. It is a commitment to preserving the uniqueness of the Baja California Peninsula.” “Not only is this discovery a perfect example of the importance of good old-fashioned natural history field work, but we have the opportunity to develop a conservation plan based on our findings."" - Scott Tremor, San Diego Natural History Museum The museum plans to continue working with Terra Peninsular to save the rodents that are known for their ""large, powerful hind feet"" that allow them to jump around like kangaroos. “Terra Peninsular has been monitoring the nature reserves looking for this species. You can’t imagine how happy we are to find out that after all these efforts and with the help of The Nat we can be part of this rediscovery and continue working on its protection,” Jorge Andrade, adaptive manager coordinator at Terra Peninsular, said in a news release. “It’s very gratifying for us to think that the San Quintin kangaroo rat persists in the area to some extent, thanks to the efforts of the staff, board members, and associated researchers of our organization.” This isn't the first time researchers from the San Diego museum uncovered an extinct species. In fact, this is the third mammal — joining the high elevation California vole and round-tail ground squirrel — thought to be extinct that the staff has recovered in the Baja California Peninsula in recent years. “These rediscoveries speak to hope and resilience in a changing world,” Sula Vanderplank, a research associate at Terra Peninsular, said in a statement. “We are learning so much about this animal and its ecology, and we’re delighted to know that it is permanently protected in the Valle Tranquilo Nature Reserve.” The researchers will elaborate on their findings in a study that will be published in the scientific journal ""Bulletin of the Southern California Academy of Sciences.""",Researchers from the San Diego Natural History Museum and the non-profit Terra Peninsular were scratching their heads when they found unfamiliar rodents in traps they placed around a field in Baja California.,2018-04-20T22:15:00Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}",California researchers accidentally find 'feisty' rodent thought to have gone extinct 30 years ago,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2018/04/20/california-researchers-accidentally-find-feisty-rodent-thought-to-have-gone-extinct-30-years-ago.html,http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/science/2018/04/20/california-researchers-accidentally-find-feisty-rodent-thought-to-have-gone-extinct-30-years-ago/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1524260816139.jpg?ve=1,fox-news,Fox News,tremor,1

The quakes were well beneath the ocean and there were no initial reports of damage or injury. The NOAA reported that no tsunami was expected from the quakes. The two morning earthquakes struck two days after a magnitude 7.9 quake in the Gulf of Alaska, which resulted in a tsunami watch that was later canceled. The 5.8 earthquake struck at 8:39 a.m. about 115 miles west of Eureka, Calif., at a depth of 5 kilometers. The closest quake to shore came at 9:24 a.m. and had a magnitude of 5.0, according to the USGS. That one had a depth of 4 kilometers and was about 112 miles west of Ferndale. ""Historically this is a very active area, "" said Keith Knudsen, deputy director of the Earthquake Science Center at the USGS. He said the quakes occurred at ""the boundary between two plates that are moving relatively fast, past each other and we call this area the Mendocino Triple Junction, which implies there are three plates, and there are, but these particular quakes occurred in a boundary between two plates."" The USGS initially reported a third quake during the same hour with a 5.1 magnitude, but that turned out to be a duplicate report of the second, Knudsen said. He added that almost 150 people in the area reported light shaking. The operators of the Victorian Inn in Ferndale said nobody on staff felt the shaking, but there was some talk around town about it.

https://www.facebook.com/WTKR3/,"First it was catastrophic lava. Then it was sulfur dioxide. Now Big Island residents have yet another danger to worry about. Laze — a mashup of “lava” and “haze” — is a nasty product formed when hot lava hits the ocean, sending hydrochloric acid and volcanic glass particles into the air. And now it’s a real threat after lava crossed Highway 137 late Saturday night and entered the Pacific Ocean, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said. Laze can cause lung, eye and skin irritation. And it has proven deadly in the past. “This hot, corrosive gas mixture caused two deaths immediately adjacent to the coastal entry point in 2000, when seawater washed across recent and active lava flows,” the HVO said. Officials are warning people to stay away from areas where lava meets the ocean. But further inland, residents have other problems. The HVO also reported sulfur dioxide emissions have tripled. Because of lava entering the ocean, the US Coast Guard enforced a Lava Entry Safety Zone Sunday for the navigable waters around the Kilauea Volcano. A Coast Guard news release says the safety zone includes all waters extending about 300 meters around the entry of the lava flow. “All waterway users should be aware of the hazardous conditions associated with such an event. Getting too close to the lava can result in serious injury or death,” said Lt. Cmdr. John Bannon, waterways management lead for the Coast Guard’s Honolulu sector. More eruptions, more earthquakes The Kilauea volcano erupted at least twice this weekend — at one point launching a cloud of ash up to 10,000 feet high. “These eruptions caused a 5.0 magnitude and a 4.9 magnitude tremor at the summit,” CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. “Additional explosive events that could produce minor amounts of ashfall downwind are possible at any time.” Since Kilauea’s massive eruption May 3, Brink said, about 2,250 earthquakes have struck on or around Hawaii’s Big Island. As the Earth keeps shaking, liquid fire keeps flowing. Lava picks up speed Flaming rivers of molten rock have already destroyed at least 40 structures. But newer, fresher lava shooting out from fissures spell more danger. “The consistency of lava is now changing,” CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. “Now it is runnier, but that is allowing it to move faster.” The volcano has caused almost two dozen fissures to crack the Earth’s surface open — purging fountains of lava and dangerous sulfur dioxide. And some fissures refuse to die. “A handful of old fissures have reactivated and joined together over the past few days,” CNN’s Scott McLean reported from Pahoa. “Lava is pouring out like a fountain … feeding a fast-moving lava stream that’s now reached the ocean.” Resident Ikaika Marzo said the lava flow isn’t just treacherous. It’s like hell on Earth. “It sounds like 10 or 20 jets taking off from your backyard at the same time,” Marzo told CNN affiliate Hawaii News Now. “It’s been like hell,” he said. “It’s like huge grenades going off. It shakes the whole community.”",wtkr.com Hawaii lava finally reaches the Pacific — only to create another deadly danger wtkr.com First it was catastrophic lava. Then it was sulfur dioxide.

Bryan Bishop,"HBO’s science fiction drama Westworld isn’t just known for its talented cast and its philosophical musings about the nature of reality. It’s also become famous for its reveals, from mind-bending bombshells that link two characters to simple pieces of backstory that bring new insight to a storyline. Watching Westworld is like peeling an onion, one layer at a time. That’s why for the show’s second season, I’ll be diving into one particular spoilery revelation from each episode, to figure out what it means, how we got here, and where things might go in the episodes to come. Some weeks, it might be a huge plot twist. In other weeks, it might be something subtle. Either way, we’re going to spoil the hell out of it. Welcome to the Westworld Spoilers Club. One of the more notable characters introduced during season 2 of Westworld is the founder of the mega-corporation that runs Westworld and its sister parks: James Delos (Peter Mullan). He first showed up in the second episode, “Reunion,” demonstrating a noted lack of interest in the long-term potential of robotic hosts — until a crafty William (Jimmi Simpson) convinced him otherwise. As that same episode revealed, James Delos retired, giving William the opportunity to take over and become the ruthless Man in Black (Ed Harris) from later Westworld timelines. But there was a mini-mystery left unanswered, a lingering cough that indicated Delos was facing health problems and might not be long for this world. In spite of the wealth and success he had accumulated, and the technical acumen of his society, he seemed to be fatally ill. But as last night’s episode, “The Riddle of the Sphinx,” revealed, Delos, Inc. has an answer for that problem, too. Photo: HBO The big reveal? The episode opens on a spinning record: “Play With Fire,” by The Rolling Stones. There are a number of ways to read that song title, but the opening moments of the episode simply follow James Delos going through the routine of an ordinary morning. He exercises on a stationary bike, has a morning cigarette, goes to the bathroom, pours his morning coffee. It’s all utterly banal — except for the slight tremor in his right hand, and the fact that his cough has vanished. James Delos is dead, and William has been interviewing a succession of hosts There’s also the matter of where he’s going about this routine. It’s a nicely decorated space with a minimalist aesthetic, but it appears to be a small studio apartment with no view of the outside — not the usual habitation of an extremely rich man. That’s because it’s actually a small medical facility. Soon enough, William shows up to chat, and it becomes clear that James Delos is being held under observation, awaiting for some final sign-off before he can leave. William is there to conduct an interview — a baseline, he says, that will be used to gauge Delos’ mindset, mood, and sense of humor. “I own a biotechnology company, and I’m dying of a disease whose research I defunded 15 years ago,” Delos shoots back. “I think my sense of humor is fucking intact.” William clarifies that the intent is to measure “fidelity” — whatever that means in this context. “So what’s the idea? That afterwards you and I have the exact same conversation?” Delos asks. “Seems a little far-fetched, doesn’t it William?” It’s confusing at first, but it’s not far-fetched at all. As the episode repeats variations of the same scene, with William showing up a little bit older each time, it becomes clear that Delos, Inc. isn’t trying to save the life of its founder. James Delos died, and William has been interviewing host clones that look like him, talk like him, have all his memories, and actually think they are him. Each, in their own time, eventually suffers a mental collapse. When older William (Ed Harris) — better known as The Man in Black — visits the James Delos host later in the episode, he reveals that while the researchers initially thought his mind was rejecting the new body, they now think it’s as if his “mind rejects reality… rejects itself.” Each and every time, it leaves them with no other option: scrap the entire thing, including the crippled host himself, and start anew. Photo: HBO What does it mean? From a character perspective, the storyline between the ever-aging William and the series of James Delos clones offer significant insight into The Man in Black. In many ways, this season is serving as his origin story, and in “The Riddle of the Sphinx,” the audience gets a first-hand glimpse at the vast change in his character over the years. William is merciful to the early James Delos clones, reluctant to put them through any unwanted suffering. But by the time we catch up to The Man in Black in a “current” timeline, his cruelty is laid bare. He tells the Delos clone that his son Logan died of an overdose; that his daughter, William’s wife, killed herself; and that Delos, Inc. has created and destroyed countless James Delos clones over the decades. The final one, it turns out, is their 149th attempt — and even he is only able to survive for little more than a month before going mad. The Man in Black even tells the latest clone that he thinks they should stop the program to bring him back altogether, and that the world is actually a better place without James Delos. The season is serving as The Man in Black’s origin story Given that this entire storyline seems to be more about William’s transformation than the fate of James Delos, the episode provides another glimpse into his character. The Man in Black seems so disgusted, so filled with contempt for everything James Delos stands for, that it begins to feel that this 149th host clone isn’t the real target of his ire at all. Every criticism The Man in Black levies could also be used to describe William himself, and as he spits his venom, it seems like he’s actually talking more about the way he feels about himself than his former boss. And as the ultimate punishment, The Man in Black leaves the Delos clone in purgatory: stuck in that solitary observation room, awake and alive, so he can feel his mind fall apart one bit at a time. Photo by John P. Johnson / HBO It’s cruel even for The Man in Black, and later in the episode, it’s left to Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) and the very-much-alive-as-predicted Elsie (Shannon Woodward) to put Delos Clone #149 out of his misery. But even though The Man in Black showed contempt for Delos, something else in him appears to be thawing. Elsewhere in the episode — in what appears to be later in The Man in Black’s own personal timeline — he’s trapped in the town of Las Mudas with Lawrence (Clifton Collins Jr.), while a host named Major Craddock (Jonathan Tucker) taunts and tortures other hosts for sport. Seeing Craddock threaten the life of Lawrence’s wife reminds The Man in Black of his own wife’s death. He retaliates, taking down Craddock’s men, and allowing Lawrence to take the final killshot on the Major to avenge his cruelty. The Door may be putting him on a path toward redemption Later, Dr. Ford appears yet again, this time speaking to The Man in Black through Lawrence’s daughter. “They might not remember, but I know who you are, William,” she says. “One good deed doesn’t change that.” The Man in Black dismisses the idea that what he did was a “good deed,” but in spite of his protestations, his actions speak for themselves. He wouldn’t have saved Lawrence’s wife earlier in the series, and whatever The Door is, it could be putting him on a possible path toward redemption. The episode seems to underscore that idea by giving The Man in Black one big opportunity right in the episode’s final moments. As he, Lawrence, and their men ride across the plains, they come across a lone woman on a horse. It’s Grace, the guest who escaped the tiger attack in The Raj last week. But when she greets the men, it’s revealed that she isn’t just some random park guest. She’s The Man in Black’s estranged daughter. Photo: HBO Changing the game Along with the character implications, the revelations about the Delos clone host program opens up the narrative of the series considerably. Originally, William saw Westworld as an opportunity to better understand customers and allow Delos, Inc. to market to them better. But now it’s clear that the company is exploring how to use host technology to create replicants of actual people — to offer up immortality as a product. This season has also revealed that the company has been quietly collecting DNA and other evidence about guests’ visits to the park. With the host clone concept, it’s not inconceivable that Delos could be interested in creating copies of some of its high-profile guests — an idea explored in the 1976 film Futureworld. But there’s a much more immediate implication, and it should excite Anthony Hopkins fans. Bernard remembers that before Dr. Ford’s death, he had Bernard print a control unit for another clone host. Given that Ford has been making brief appearances, speaking to The Man in Black through hosts like El Lazo and Lawrence’s daughter, the dots become almost too easy to connect: Ford created a host clone of himself before setting off the “Journey Into Night” narrative, and now that host is somewhere in the park, overseeing everything while everybody thinks Ford is dead and gone. Of course, that’s all just speculation, but if true, it gives the focus on timeframes a new sort of urgency. It was established earlier in the season that the storyline of Bernard scouring the parks with Delos security forces takes place 11 days after the robot uprising. The 149th James Delos host was only able to last 35 days before starting to “degrade.” If there is a Dr. Ford host clone out there, he may have an expiration date — and could be nearly halfway there.",A major revelation opens up a host of possibilities… and one possible character return?,2018-05-14T15:40:32Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Westworld may just give The Man in Black a shot at redemption,https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17351134/westworld-season-2-episode-4-the-riddle-of-the-sphinx-recap,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MfrWHoxZcQTWIyYV96lHhKDpFUk=/0x0:2000x1047/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10834365/1_kWPv1VyCjuACGjrSoCeBOg.jpeg,the-verge,The Verge,tremor,1
Olivia B. Waxman,"“This is Mississippi, the middle of the iceberg. This is a tremor in the middle of the iceberg from a stone that the builders rejected,” Bob Moses, the director of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)’s Mississippi project, wrote in 1961 from a jail cell in Magnolia, Miss., where he and 11 other activists who had been trying to help fellow African Americans register to vote had been imprisoned. Now, more than 50 years since that tremor catalyzed a seismic shift in American society, Saturday will see the grand opening of the Museum of Mississippi History and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum — making Mississippi the first U.S. state to have its own official state-funded civil rights museum. In eight galleries, visitors start at the beginning with the Atlantic slave trade and move through displays on the Emancipation Proclamation and Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the ’60s and the present moment, ending with a room to reflect on the modern-day offshoots of the movement. It’s a striking moment for a state that was often the violent epicenter of the fight for racial equality in the United States — and a reminder that the history to which the museum is devoted is not fully in the past, as President Trump’s plan to attend the grand opening has prompted some to consider protesting the event. Ahead of the grand opening, TIME talked to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum’s director, Pamela Junior, about what she hopes visitors will take away from the new exhibits. TIME: What are some of the most unique artifacts in the collection? JUNIOR: The actual rifle that Byron De La Beckwith used to assassinate Medgar Evers is here, given to us by the Hinds County Circuit Court. The doors to Bryant’s Grocery that Emmett Till touched in August 1965, before he was lynched. It’s amazing that this young boy, 14 years old, went into a store to buy a piece of gum, never knowing this was going to happen to him later on that evening. When I saw those doors for the first time, it was hard for me to get close to them because I couldn’t reconcile with those doors. There’s a burned cross, that’s part of the Klan exhibition. We have three Klan robes. What it’s doing is showing how the Klan would come onto the property with a small coffin, put it on your doorstep, and the next day come and put a cross in front of your house. One particular gentleman picked it up and kept it. I’m amazed, still, that people kept these artifacts. How did they know that one day there’d be a place to put it? Now there is. The museum’s layout is circular. Why? The circle has to do with everything being so dark that you needed to be able to come out and sit and reflect before you go back into the tunnel, as I tell people. The civil rights movement was a very uncomfortable movement. The architect made everything very close, very tight, and I love that. You walk into a gallery and see lynching monoliths [listing the names of victims], and you hear the sound of people saying, “Girl, get off that sidewalk!” And it puts you in the moment. You hear rifles being ready to shoot, and you hear dogs barking. All of this is part of putting people in that time period. And you come out of that and into a rotunda, where there is a 37-foot-high circular sculpture called “This Little Light of Mine” that moves when you walk in. When one person walks in, it kind of flickers. The more people walk in, the more it starts dancing. And what it’s symbolizing is all of the people who came to help bring a change to Mississippi. People are a little nervous when they come in and see images of people that have been lynched, when they the imprint of the bodies of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner in shallow graves. I’ve seen crying, and people coming out to just breathe because it was so heavy. One lady told me she couldn’t breathe. I get that. That’s the dark tunnel that’s part of what Mississippi went through. We’re serious about this. Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter Growing up in Mississippi, what inspired you to make a career out of educating people on the history of civil rights? When I was 11 years old, the first book I read, as far as a novel, was Black Boy by Richard Wright. Richard Wright was a genius because the same problems the black boy had in the [Jim Crow South] are the same problems happening today in the 21st century. Freedom Schools were big in Jackson so sometimes my parents would allow me to go hang out and be around students who were a part of Freedom Schools. What gave me my strength is not the information I got in school, but when I was 12 in 1970, I was walking through Jackson State campus from middle school, and a Black Panther put a black band on my arm. And that did something for me. I didn’t take that black band off for probably about three weeks. Made me feel like there something I’m supposed to be doing. It just stuck with me forever. What does it mean for Mississippi to have the first such state-sponsored civil rights museum? What it means is that Mississippi is ready, finally, to tell the truth. Mississippi has the best people to tell the story. It’s right here. It’s in black and white. Come and understand the people of Mississippi. Come and understand the struggle. Come and understand the folks who gave their lives up for people in Mississippi. That’s a great example for people all over the world. We’re going to help ourselves by really reading and listening and teaching our children about this history — and about mobilizing, strategizing and organizing.

ABC News,"An explosion rocked Hawaii's Kilauea volcano early Tuesday morning, spewing ash nearly a mile into the air and sparking an earthquake that registered 5.5 magnitude on the Richter scale, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Interested in Volcanoes? Add Volcanoes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Volcanoes news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The tremor occurred at around 4:30 a.m. local time, the agency reported. It was not clear if any damage was caused, but no tsunami was expected, officials said. Thousands of residents have been evacuated from the area and lava spewing from the volcano's fissures have destroyed more than 100 structures since the first eruption a month ago. The incident didn't trigger tsunami warnings due to the small size of the earthquake. ""It's not big enough,"" Cindi Preller, geologist and duty scientist at the Oahu office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told ABC News. Instead, tsunamis or tidal waves, become more serious threats if the size of the earthquake increases, Preller said. ""Anything above 6.9 [magnitude] is our threshold,"" she said, noting that it would warn people to stay clear of the ocean in such an event. On May 4, a 6.9-magnitude earthquake was centered near the south flank of Kilauea one hour after a 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck nearby, the U.S. Geological Survey confirmed. Eruptions like the one today may not wane anytime soon, Preller cautioned. ""This could go on for months,"" she said. ""The volcano is active and when these eruptive sequences get underway it's doing exactly as it's supposed to do, behaving as it should.""",An ash explosion rocked the Kilauea volcano Tuesday.,2018-06-05T16:58:15Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Explosion rocks Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, sending ash 1 mile high",https://abcnews.go.com/US/explosion-rocks-hawaiis-kilauea-volcano-sending-ash-mile/story?id=55661514,https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/hawaii-lava-ocean-zp-ps-180604_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,tremor,1

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"When Sarah's Hill's son complained of aching legs, her GP told her not to worry. But it was one of the first signs Alex had Parkinson's disease, a condition usually associated with the over-60s. Alex Hill was just eight years old when his mother first thought there might be something seriously wrong with him. Sarah noticed he complained about his legs hurting for days after taking part in a PE lesson. She had already spotted that he dragged one leg when he was tired. ""I thought that wasn't right for a young child,"" she says. She took Alex to her GP in Folkestone who told her there was nothing to worry about. But Alex developed more odd symptoms. ""He didn't want to leave me, even though he loved going to school. He also became quite obsessive. He had to pack loads of pairs of underpants in his bag and we weren't allowed to leave the house without them,"" Hill says. On another day Alex opened his bedroom window and shouted at the birds to shut up. ""It was really strange and out of character so I went back to the GP to see if he needed to go and see a psychiatrist, but again I was dismissed."" A few months later Sarah was talking to her son when he suddenly fell flat on his back. He couldn't explain what had happened. His handwriting had deteriorated and Sarah's father had also noticed Alex had a slight tremor. He wondered whether it might be Parkinson's, but the GP laughed at the idea. Alex was referred to a local paediatrician, who decided to treat him for epilepsy. However, the medication made no difference and within months he was falling up to 28 times a day. ""He couldn't sit down because he was so bruised and would have to lie on his tummy,"" Hill says. Image caption Wednesday 11 April is World Parkinson's Day He was finally referred to the Evelina Children's Hospital in London. Within a day the specialists there diagnosed Alex with juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease. A brain scan revealing low levels of the chemical dopamine confirmed it. For Sarah Hill it felt like ""falling in to a black hole"", although she reassured her son they would deal with whatever happened. Some 120,000 people have Parkinson's in the UK, with the majority diagnosed over the age of 60. About 5% experience symptoms before the age of 40, but it's very rare for people to be diagnosed under the age of 20. After viewing some home videos, doctors said Alex had shown signs of the condition at the age of three, but they could not explain why he had developed the disease. Neither Hill nor Alex's father had a family history of Parkinson's. Alex was put on the drug Levodopa, which acted like ""rocket fuel"". ""It was good for getting him moving but it made him a bit manic. I had to hide phones in the house as he kept calling the police just to talk to them,"" Hill says. She gave up training as a fitness instructor to become Alex's carer. Diagnosing and treating Parkinson's There are more than 40 symptoms and these can include vomiting as the body struggles to process food in the gut. Parkinson's can also affect a person's mood which may explain Alex's shouting out. Often a person will feel they have got to grips with their condition then a new symptom will emerge and because it is so varied, there is not one treatment for every symptom. Areas of research showing promise include stem cell treatment and gene therapies, but more work is needed. We know that people under 40 can often struggle to get a diagnosis because juvenile Parkinson's is so rare. However, Parkinson's can affect people of all ages. It is vital that professionals look at the symptoms a person has, rather than making assumptions based on their age, so people get the right diagnosis, first time. Prof David Dexter, deputy director of research at Parkinson's UK By the time he was 12 he was mostly using a wheelchair. He found it hard to be around his old school friends, who could still run about. He eventually moved to a school for children with special needs, but found the teaching level too low. After a couple of years, Alex stopped responding to his medication so when he was 14 he underwent deep brain stimulation. In this procedure electrodes are implanted in the brain, which deliver high-frequency stimulation to targeted areas. The surgery reduced his tremors and ""gave him back his smile"", Hill says. ""He could do a lot more, like play his XBox."" Image caption Alex with his sister, Becky, and his mother (right) at the 2012 London Olympics Alex moved on to another school in Sevenoaks, which helped him study for his GCSEs, using a computer talking board. He wasn't able to continue his education, but still enjoys learning. ""He loves sciences and likes to catch up on some Maths and English,"" Hill says. As Alex's condition slowly declined, Hill began to feel she couldn't cope. ""I felt like I was fighting Parkinson's on my own because at Alex's age it's so unusual,"" she says. ""I asked about prognosis and was just told to keep him as fit and healthy as I could. ""I was exhausted and grieving before I needed to grieve. I was often relying on my sister to pull me back up."" Hill decided the best decision - for her and Alex - would be for Alex to move to a care home down the road. ""It means I can be his mum again, not just his carer. We can play games and have fun,"" Hill says. Image caption Alex and Sarah Hill Alex remains fully involved in family life, attending family barbecues and events like his sister Becky's wedding. ""He had a wonderful time. It wouldn't have been the same without him,"" Hill says. Alex is fed through a tube in his stomach as he struggles with swallowing and he often finds it difficult to sleep, sometimes shouting out. He needs assistance for most things and has a close bond with two workers at the home. His mother visits every other day and makes video calls in between. Now 24, Alex doesn't want to talk in detail about his condition although he says losing the ability to walk was the toughest challenge. ""Alex doesn't like to relive his experience. He'd rather focus on having fun times now, which is a really good way to be,"" Hill says. His interests now include ""films like Harry Potter and TV shows like Doctor Who"". He also enjoys painting. ""He can't really play his XBox now but he likes to watch me play it and point out how I've gone wrong!"" Hill says. Alex describes his mother as ""the best mum in the whole wide world"". They are hoping to go on holiday to Wales this summer. Hill keeps a look out for any new medications that may ease her son's symptoms but says, ""We live each day as best we can.""

Alexandra Ulmer,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A major earthquake of magnitude 7.3 struck Venezuela’s eastern coast, home to largely poor fishing communities, on Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings as far away as Colombian capital Bogota and knocking power out in parts of Trinidad. But the quake’s depth - 76.5 miles (123 km) below the surface - appeared to have mitigated the damage. Venezuelan officials said there were no immediate reports of injuries and two sources at state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] told Reuters the OPEC member’s refineries and oil fields were operating normally. PDVSA did not immediately comment. Venezuela is not in a good shape to deal with a natural disaster. It is already wrestling with a crippling economic crisis with medicine running short, hospitals barely able to function and some severe shortages of basics such as chicken and milk. The tremor - one of the country’s strongest ever - hit at 5.31 p.m. (2131 GMT). Along Venezuela’s picturesque palm tree-dotted northern coast, residents said the long quake was terrifying and frightened people into dashing into the streets. “I had gotten into bed to watch the news on TV and my bed started to move as if it was made of water,” said Elia Sanchez, a doctor in Cumana, the capital of the eastern state of Sucre that was the closest to the coastal epicenter. “We had to go down nine floors, it felt like it would never end.” Rosymer Rodriguez, also in Cumana, said she could not see any significant damage but that people were still fearful. “There are still people in the street. There are people packing bags in case there are aftershocks,” said Rodriguez. Damage in Caracas was limited, but the quake did tilt the top five floors of an abandoned 45-story skyscraper known as the ‘Tower of David’, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said. The tower, originally intended to be a bank center but abandoned since 1994 and later occupied by squatters for years, dominates Caracas’ skyline. It features in the U.S. television spy drama “Homeland”. Pictures after the quake showed the building’s top floors, which are unfinished, leaning sideways. Out east, the governor of Sucre called for calm. “Do not fall victim to psychological terror, messages about a tsunami and all that,” said governor Edwin Rojas, who belongs to President Nicolas Maduro’s Socialist Party. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment for additional information. ANDES, CARIBBEAN HIT The quake was felt in capital Caracas, neighboring Colombia and nearby island nations like Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Lucia, to the west and north. In Trinidad and Tobago, there were initial reports of some cracks to buildings, cars damaged when concrete debris fell on them, and loss of electricity. Traffic jams formed on highways in Port of Spain, but there were no immediate reports of casualties there either. Colombia’s government said the country was unharmed too, although workers dashed out of high-rise blocks in the mountainous capital Bogota. “It was a moment of panic, we thought the worst,” said Jimena Valencia, a 29-year-old administrator in the north of Bogota. The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Center canceled an earlier warning of a possible tsunami along the coast near the epicenter, some 190 kilometers (118 miles) from Cumana. United States Geological Survey geophysicist Jessica Turner said the quake’s depth would have dampened some of the shaking. “A 7.3 magnitude quake is going to cause some damage, particularly as in this area, structures are vulnerable. The Earth is able to absorb some of the energy, but a 7.3 quake produces a lot of energy,” she said by telephone.

Lucina Melesio,"Mexico City - Ivon Romero lives with her husband and five children in a large auditorium in the back of a cultural centre in the Gustavo A Madero district of Mexico City. If it wasn't for the security guard, who locks and guards the entrance 24 hours a day, the centre would look abandoned. Overgrown grass lines the entrance and broken toilets that look as though they have never been cleaned sit outside. Inside, Romero, along with her husband, Miguel Angel Gonzalez, try to keep life as normal as possible for their five children aged between three and 12. But the cots the government gave them when they moved in seven months ago are broken. The large room they spend their time in has a loud echo. And the only furniture inside are a couple of tables the family uses to eat and cook on, a hot plate, seven chairs and a couch. About seven blocks away sits the remnants of what was once their longtime home. On September 19, 2017, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit the country, killing nearly 230 people in Mexico City alone. At least 40 buildings completely collapsed and more than 5,000 others were damaged, according to local authorities. One year on, NGOs estimate about 8,000 people live in damaged homes, others remain in shelters, awaiting clarity on how, and if, the government, which set aside a nearly $800m reconstruction budget, will ever help them rebuild. Romero's home, part of an old housing compound shared with five other families, still stood after the September 2017 earthquake, but was severely damaged. The city's Civil Protection underpinned the structures with wooden struts, leaving gaping holes in part of the structure. ""My children used to wake up at night with nightmares,"" Romero tells Al Jazeera. ""They were scared that the house would crumble down and kill us all."" Their nightmares became partially true in February of this year when another tremor hit the country. Although the 7.2-magnitude earthquake's epicentre was far from the capital, it brought down the rest of Romero's home. She recalls barely making it out in time before the roof collapse behind them. Some families, including Romero's, were put in shelters and receive monthly stipends, which generally amount to less than $200. After Romero's house collapsed, the municipality offered her family the option to live in homeless shelters, but that would have meant living separately from her husband in a female-only facility. Instead, the city placed the family in a makeshift shelter in the worn-down cultural centre in one of the Mexico City's most dangerous areas. ""We had so little left, and yet someone broke in and stole whatever we had gathered,"" says Romero, who is eight months pregnant. ""Even the baby clothing and the crib,"" she adds, breaking down in tears, unsure if her home will ever be rebuilt as questions remain regarding the funds meant for reconstruction. Unaccounted for funds A month after the earthquake, Mexico City's government put together an expert advisory committee to establish a reconstruction policy, which included determining how much money was needed to rebuild and how to manage it in a transparent way. But after $797m was allocated for the reconstruction fund in January, the local congress overrode the committee and ordered the funds be directed to different governmental agencies without any explanation. ""It became obvious our role there was pointless,"" says Ricardo Becerra, who was appointed by Mexico City's then-Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera to head the advisory committee. Most of the committee members, including Becerra, resigned, with some believing corruption was at play. Mancera denied allegations that the city intended to use the funds for anything other than reconstruction. After public outcry, the then-mayor revoked authority to manage the reconstruction funds from those local congressmen who ordered the funds be directed to government agencies. Although the government is required by law to account for every penny they spend on reconstruction, about 95 percent of the funds allocated for reconstruction remain unaccounted for, according to NGOs and analysis of publicly available data. The government reconstruction accountability website does not clarify how most of the funds were split between the different agencies following the local congress's order. In July, Nosotrxs, an NGO tracking the government's reconstruction efforts, published a report outlining the lack of transparency on how the funds have been spent. Only 4.7 percent of the funds had been accounted for, according to Nosotrxs. Mexico's former Finance Secretary Edgar Amador declined Al Jazeera's multiple requests for comment. The city's former Mayor Mancera and current Mayor Jose Ramon Amieva did not respond to Al Jazeera's interview requests. Bureaucratic nightmare Compounding the hardship faced by survivors are the hurdles they must jump in order to access the funds and reconstruction programmes. In addition to the meagre rent subsidies, the government has promised to help people living in apartment buildings by giving them credits to rebuild. Residents have protested against the system, demanding subsidies instead of the loans. Others complain of the bureaucratic nightmare they face to access the credits or other reconstruction programmes. ""Everywhere we go it's a different story, they send us to different agencies and no one can tell us what are the next steps,"" says Romero's husband, Gonzalez, who used to craft aluminium for a living from the workshop he had at home. The family keeps a thick folder with paperwork they have filed to different agencies, and handwritten letters they have sent the mayor and other government offices asking for help. There's been no written response to their inquires. Like many Mexicans, who live in homes that have been a part of their family for generations, Romero's family does not have the property deeds under its own name and the process to obtain the correct documents is too expensive. Arcadio Resendiz and his family are in a similar situation and equally confused about how to obtain the reconstruction funds. They also lived in a house within a family complex that has the deeds under a deceased relative's name. The bedroom of their granddaughters' room collapsed during the September 2017 earthquake and the rest of their house remains in bad shape. ""We really don't know what to do, every agency tells us something different,"" says Resendiz, holding a thick pile of paperwork. ""Some have told us we shouldn't touch anything nor remove the rubble because we won't be able to access the programmes if we do,"" he tells Al Jazeera, explaining that the rain that falls inside the holes in his roof, causing further damage. In July, the Civil Protection deemed the entire complex where Resendiz's home stands unsafe, saying it needs to be demolished. But the 50-year-old, who cannot work due to health issues, is unsure what to do because he hasn't been told what will happen next. ""We can't have it demolished without knowing if they'll rebuild it; where will we go?"" he says. Civil Protection and the mayor's office did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment. Nowhere to go Vania Salgado, an economist turned-activist after surviving the earthquake, says the problem is not only that families are unsure of how to access the reconstruction programmes, but that they are also living in damaged houses that are unsafe. According to Nosotrxs, which surveyed 272 homes earlier this month, individuals and families lived in more than 30 percent of the damaged buildings that were surveyed. About 25 percent of the homes that have been tagged ""high risk of collapsing"" are still inhabited. And nearly half of the buildings that need to be demolished are still standing. Cesar Cravioto, a Mexico City congressman who will be in charge of reconstruction when the new administration takes office in December, tells Al Jazeera that he is well aware of the problems survivors, like Romero and Resendiz, face. ""Not having your deeds in order shouldn't prevent people from receiving the help they need,"" Cravioto says. ""Today people have to suffer a terrible ordeal parading between different government agencies to get some help, and that needs to change."" Cravioto says he will prioritise finishing the damaged homes census, which was ordered last year, and setting up what he calls a single-booth programme so that survivors can get help from a single agency. He also says he expects to finish with reconstruction within two years, adding that money shouldn't not be an issue. ""It is the current administration's responsibility to hand us over the funds with clear accountability,"" Cravioto says. ""We will audit them, and we hope they leave us enough funds for reconstruction. But either way, money will not be an issue,"" he adds without elaborating. We can't have [our home] demolished without knowing if they'll rebuild it; where will we go? Arcadio Resendiz In the meantime, families like Romero's and Resendiz's continue to manage with the little they have. Romero and her husband say they recently asked the security guard outside the building for more blankets, but he refused. ""People are mean to us because they think we are living here because we are lazy and aren't doing enough,"" she says. ""It's not true, we're really doing what we can.""",Survivors of last year's deadly Mexico City tremor say they're still awaiting clarity on how to access funds to rebuild.,2018-09-19T15:12:02Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Mexico quake one year on: Families still wait for help to rebuild,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/mexico-quake-year-families-wait-rebuild-180918213329422.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/9/18/8fc41e8eac584be0859299e2b6b89707_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,tremor,1
Andrea James,"Architect Shinsuke Fujii accepted the challenge from a client who wanted an accessible tall bookshelf that would not be affected by an earthquake. One entire wall of the house is slanted outward to allow climbing without any chance of tipping over. Via Spoon &amp; Tamago : The client, who happened to be an avid book lover, approached Fujii with the task to design a home around a large bookshelf that’s both easily accessible but also one that won’t spill all the books if there’s ever a tremor. The solution was to slant the entire western-facing façade and create a built-in slanted bookshelf whose shelves also function as a ladder. The slant allowed family members of all ages to climb up and reach books, but also keeps the books from falling should an earthquake ever shake the home. The slanted façade also had the effect of creating an open feeling in the family room, where the home’s high perch allowed for plenty of sunlight to enter through the large windows.

Robin George Andrews,"Between Mozambique and Madagascar lies the island of Mayotte. Since May 10, the French Geological Survey has been keeping an eye on a collection of earthquakes taking place just off the islands eastern shores, which peaked with a magnitude 5.8 shake. This swarm was curious enough all by itselfand then, on November 11, things took a peculiar turn. That day, seismographs all over the world registered a very low-frequency tremor, a strange grumble that lasted for around 30 minutes. One segment of the signal also featured several high-frequency blips, each separated by roughly a minute of time, a bit like a regular, ticking clock. Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton, highlighted the phenomenon in a November 12 tweet. Something biggggg, yet strangely slow, sent seismic rumblings around the surface of much of the planet yesterday, he wrote. Today, that succinct summary still holds, even as discussion of the event continues between geoscientists of all kinds over on Twitter. To date, no one is quite sure what caused it. It wasnt a tectonic earthquake, a landslide, nor a meteorite impact. Some experts baffled by the seismic enigma have not-so-seriously suggested that perhaps, finally, its sea monsters. The strange sound was almost certainly not Godzilla taking a submarine stroll, but scientists are starting to coalesce around what they suspect may be the answer: strange and unseen movements of magma, far beneath the seafloor. In order to understand why, though, we have to go back to the very beginning. Robin Lacassin, a geologist at the Paris Institute of Earth Physics, told Gizmodo that Mayotte is part of the Comoros archipelago, a chain of volcanic islands that first saw fireworks 20 million years ago. Eruptions have flared up in recent times on other islands, most notably Grande Comore. Conversely, Mayotte, a comparatively dormant presence, hasnt seen any fresh lava for around 4,000 years. In any case, volcanism in the regionpowered by a small rising mantle plume or a deformed tectonic plateis alive and kicking. The swarm of earthquakes taking place near Mayotte, although new for the area, resemble those produced by magmatic processes of some kind, including the movement of magma and other superheated fluids. The November 11 signal, however, is a very different kettle of fish. No specific natural process has yet been linked to the seismic data, and the lack of monitoring at the site of the event means even its precise location is currently unclear. First, lets look at that low-frequency hum. Representing surface waves traveling across the planet, this dominated the global signal. High-frequency waves were not picked up by distant stations. Hicks told Gizmodo that a good analogy here is someone living down the road from a nightclub. You might not be next door, but as long as the energy behind the beats is high enough, what youll hear is the bass, not the higher-pitched stuff, which weakens relatively quickly. Potent bass lines can be created by many slow, powerful events, from tectonic earthquakes to submarine landslides and even glacial calvings. In this case, the tide gauges failed to show any changes during the event, meaning there were no mass movements on the seafloor of any kind. The few GPS stations in the region recorded some local seafloor movement, but just a little, suggesting the signals source was fairly deep. The only plausible explanation remaining was some sort of volcanism. Thats perfectly reasonable; after all, Mayotte is volcanic, and the swarm resembles volcanic activity. Anthony Lomax, a consulting seismologist, told Gizmodo that its probably volcanic activity, causing earthquakes. Although a submarine eruption cannot be ruled out, there are as yet no observable signs that one took place, like fresh lava on the seafloor or a floating raft of pumice at the surface. Instead, Lacassin said that all the data points to the movement of magma within the crust. But where exactly was it going? A day after the event, researchers at the ENS University in Paris suspected magma was draining from the site, causing the roof of a reservoir of magma to collapse and cause quakes. In a statement, they reckoned that 0.3 cubic miles of magma draining from a reservoir would fit the GPS data well. A good comparison here, according to Lomax, is what was seen recently at Kilauea in Hawaii. During that eruption, magma continuously drained from the summit crater. The crater deflated, causing earthquakes, and magma escaped underground to the volcanos eastern flanks. However, Hicks initial analysis of the available data seemed to indicate magma was moving into a reservoir and inflating it. Jean Paul Ampuero, a seismologist and director of research at Frances Research Institute for Development, agreed. Collapse events or inflation events have opposite signs, he told Gizmodo. This one is of the inflation type. At the time of writing, Hicks analysis is leaning toward drainage again. Either way, its got to be moving magma, but nothings certain yet. The deficit of instruments near the signal site means there are no real before-and-after datasets, Helen Robinson, a geothermal expert and PhD candidate at Glasgow University, told Gizmodo. Useful information as to what physically changed at that spot near Mayotte doesnt really exist. The key piece of evidence here is the seismic signal, which certainly shows the ghost of something strange. The signal is so utterly weird, though, that its proving difficult to decipher. Ampuero said he spoke to a colleague of his whose expertise is in the seismology of volcanoes. They confirmed that the internal chaos of volcanoes can cause very low-frequency hums, but the incredibly long 30-minute duration of this one was currently inexplicable. In order to get this sort of prolonged, low-frequency grumble, youd need something big to resonate. Its like a ringing bell. If you want to get a very low frequency, a very low tone, you need that bell to be huge, Ampuero explained. Maybe the magma reservoir has been hit by a wave of little quakes, and then kept ringing for a little while. Then, there are those clockwork-like high-frequency blips, which revealed themselves after seismologists began filtering out the signals deep hum. Robinson explained that such blips are like those detected when rock is being fractured as magma forces its way through. What baffles me is how evenly spaced out they were, she said. I have no idea how to explain that. Neither, as it turns out, can anyone else. Signals with very regular intervals tend to be artificially generated, but they can have natural origins. Just take pulsars : When these rapidly rotating, lighthouse-like objects were discovered in the 1960s, the regularity of the flashes were briefly suspected of being generated by intelligent life. The original source was even dubbed LGM, for little green men. Here, the high-frequency blips instinctively brought industrial or military activity to Robinsons mind, but there is no sign of anything of the sort in the region. In this case, the regularity could perhaps be magma moving at a constant rate through the rock, causing repeating fractures. Like much about the signal, this interpretation is far from certain. Lomax brings up the parable of the Blind Men and the Elephant, which tells the tale of said men encountering an elephant for the first time, with each trying to identify what it is by touching just one part of it. Similarly, researchers of different geoscience stripes are giving their own interpretation of the curious signal. Thats a good start, because you want different takes from different directions, Lomax said. Cracking the case, however, is a team effort. Fortunately, judging by the frenetic scientific discussion still taking place on social media, thats already in full swing.","Between Mozambique and Madagascar lies the island of Mayotte.

Jesus Diaz,"Both Android and iOS have an accessibility mode to help people with different degrees of visual and auditive disabilities. That includes interface tweaks like higher contrast, larger type, audio cues, and text-to-speech technology, and these features have enabled millions to use these devices. But there are still disabilities that get overlooked when it comes to accessibility. Now, artificial intelligence is helping designers close that gap by automatically creating and testing new interfaces based on the unique cognitive models of people with sensorimotor and cognitive impairments. For instance, the software might optimize a smartphone keyboard for people with essential hand tremors by adapting the size of each button or the frequency of spellchecks. [Image: Kochi University of Technology] Scientists from Aalto University in Finland and Kochi University of Technology in Japan developed the software, which they describe in the current issue of the IEEE Pervasive Computing Journal. First, they created a “cognitive profile” for each of the disabilities they were targeting: people suffering from dyslexia, tremor, and memory disorders. These profiles–created from observing real people–contain parameters that tell the computer how a user would interact with the screen depending on their cognitive, sensorial, or motor impairment. The machine then went on to optimize the typical smartphone keyboard based on the profiles, creating countless variations to measure it against the simulated behavior of each of these three cognitive models. The variations can number in the millions, so it’s impossible to test them with real users. Instead, their software simulated how people would use each interface based on its profile data. Essentially, they created a virtual user with a specific disability and ran millions of tests on them to determine the best UI. [Photo: Kochi University of Technology] When they tested this solution with a real person suffering from essential hand tremors –a nerve disorder that makes some parts of your body shake uncontrollably, like Parkinson’s–they found out that, indeed, the person behaved almost exactly the same as in the AI simulation. He was able to use the new UI to text with nearly no errors, even while he couldn’t use a regular QWERTY keyboard at all. The researchers believe that they could do the same thing for people with many other disabilities and many other tasks, not just text entry on a keyboard. Does that mean that UI designers are out of a job? Of course not, says coauthor and Aalto University postdoctoral researcher Jussi Jokinen: “This is of course just a prototype interface, and not intended for consumer market.... Designers pick up from here and with the help of our model and optimizer create individually targeted, polished interfaces.”","The software can test millions of interfaces to find the perfect, individually tailored design for people with disabilities.

Six people have been killed in a blast at a chemical plant in Yancheng, eastern China, local authorities say.
Thirty people were also injured in the explosion, which took place at about 14:50 local time (06:50 GMT) at the plant run by Tianjiayi Chemical.
The blast was caused by a fire at the factory, which makes fertiliser, officials told local press.
China's earthquake administration reported a tremor equivalent to 2.2-magnitude at the time of the explosion.
Images on social media showed a fireball exploding at the site, billowing clouds enveloping the area, injured people and damage to buildings.
Officials quoted by Reuters said: ""At present, on-site rescue is still going on... The cause of the accident is under investigation.""
State news agency Xinhua said shockwaves from the blast had brought down nearby factory buildings, trapping workers.
Tianjiayi Chemical, founded in 2007, has received six government penalties in the past over waste management and air pollution, according to the South China Morning Post.
Several chemical plants operate in the nearby area, according to local press.
Industrial accidents are common in China due to poorly enforced safety regulations, and authorities have pledged to improve standards.
More than 160 people died in 2015 after two massive explosions in the port of Tianjin in northern China.

Al Jazeera,"At least 10 people were killed and dozens injured after a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia's Lombok island. Sunday morning's tremor was followed by two strong secondary quakes and more than 60 aftershocks, damaging many buildings. The earthquake was on land and did not trigger a tsunami. ""The earthquake killed at least 10 people, about 40 people are injured, and dozens of houses were damaged,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency. ""We estimate the number will keep rising because we are not done collecting data,"" he said. A 30-year old Malaysian woman was among the dead, he said, adding those hurt were hit by debris. The jolt was felt about 100km away on the island of Bali, although there were no immediate reports of damage there. As authorities sought to assess the damage to buildings and infrastructure on Lombok, popular trekking trails on the remote Mount Rinjani were closed because of landslides, according to the disaster agency. The epicentre of the shallow earthquake struck 50km northeast of Lombok's main city Mataram, the United States Geological Survey said, far from the main tourist spots on the south and west of the island. Two of the aftershocks measured more than 5-magnitude. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre, the European quake agency, put the magnitude at 6.5. Indonesia, an archipelago of thousands of islands, sits on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a seismic activity hotspot. It is frequently hit by quakes, most of them harmless. However, the region remains acutely alert to temblors that might trigger tsunamis. In 2004, a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 9.3 undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, in western Indonesia, killed 220,000 people in countries around the Indian Ocean, including 168,000 in Indonesia.","Early morning tremor was followed by two strong secondary quakes and more than 60 aftershocks, damaging many buildings.",2018-07-29T06:16:34Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Powerful quake kills at least 10 on Indonesia's Lombok island,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/powerful-quake-kills-10-indonesia-lombok-island-180729052501194.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/7/29/8610bdd3f54f40aabd37014fad176d1b_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,tremor,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Moment the quake struck caught on camera Some 10,000 people have been evacuated on the Indonesian island of Lombok after a powerful 6.9 magnitude quake on Sunday left more than 90 people dead. Witnesses spoke of chaos and terror as buildings collapsed and power and communication lines were cut. Boats have been sent to evacuate more than 1,000 tourists from the nearby Gili islands. Aid agencies said the priority was to provide shelter for residents too scared to return to their homes. The agencies said the impact was far bigger than another quake that hit Lombok last week, killing 16 people. What's the latest on Lombok? Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, said that the northern area of Lombok had suffered massive damage. Three C-130 Hercules aircraft and two helicopters have been deployed to deliver tents and medical aid, but the earthquake has brought down roads and bridges, making areas difficult to reach. Electricity supply in the worst-affected areas has been cut off and telecommunication networks are not working. Image copyright AFP Image caption Staff take patients outside as a safety measure at a hospital in Mataram The death toll stands at 91, all Indonesians, but Mr Sutopo said that number would ""definitely increase"". At least another 200 people have been injured. He pointed to the situation at a collapsed mosque in the village of Lading-Lading in north Lombok, where a lack of heavy lifting equipment had made it difficult to locate victims. One official said 80% of north Lombok had suffered damage. The main city of Mataram was also badly affected, with medical staff struggling to cope with the injured at the damaged hospitals. What about the Gili islands? Situated off the north-west of Lombok and popular with backpackers and divers, they were badly hit, with a number of hotels damaged. Video and still images showed hundreds of tourists flocking to the beach to be evacuated. There have been reports of deaths on the islands but these have not been confirmed. Hundreds of tourists have been taken off by boat, but hundreds still remain. Image copyright Laura Milne Image caption Tourists await evacuation on Gili Trawangan ""We cannot evacuate all of them all at once because we don't have enough capacity on the boats,"" Muhammad Faozal, of West Nusa Tenggara's tourism agency, told AFP. ""It's understandable they want to leave the Gilis, they are panicking."" What have victims and witnesses been saying? Helen Milne told the BBC that her daughter, Laura, from Oxfordshire in the UK, is on the island of Gili Trawangan. She said: ""They are stuck on the island and are reporting rioting, fighting, and people can't get on boats. There's no water, no food, the shops have been ransacked. It's a rapidly deteriorating situation out there for them."" Another Briton on Gili Trawangan, James Kelsall, told the Press Association the subsequent tsunami warning was the most terrifying part. ""All the locals were frantically running and screaming, putting on life jackets. We followed them up to higher ground, which was a steep, uneven climb to the top of a hill in darkness."" The tsunami warning was lifted after a few hours. Margret Helgadottir, from Iceland, told Agence France-Presse people screamed as the roof of her hotel on Gili Air collapsed. ""We just froze, thankfully we were outside. Everything went black, it was terrible."" Singapore's Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, on the 10th floor of a hotel room in Mataram, said on Facebook: ""Walls cracked, it was quite impossible to stand up."" And the aid agencies? Dini Widiastuti, executive director of Plan International Indonesia, told the BBC that the top priority was to provide shelter. ""Thousands of people, including children, are still just out in the fields, not properly protected. The impact is very widespread in Lombok and actually this is bigger than the first earthquake last week, so it is difficult."" Meili Narti, from Oxfam, said the government was trying to set up centres to which people could safely evacuate, but colleagues were saying some people did not have sufficient food, water or shelter. What about Bali? At least one death has been reported unofficially but it has not been confirmed. The airport has suffered some damage but is operating. The quake was felt for several seconds. One worker in Denpasar described the scene to the BBC. ""They were initially just little shocks but then they started to get bigger and bigger and people started to shout 'earthquake', then all the staff panicked and rushed out of the building,"" he said. Model and presenter Chrissy Teigen, who is on holiday in Bali, described 15 seconds of a tremor, followed by ""so many aftershocks"". Skip Twitter post by @chrissyteigen another aftershock just now. probably the 8th one we have felt since the big one last night. we are safe, up high and nothing around us. thinking about everyone around us and in Lombok especially. — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) August 6, 2018 End of Twitter post by @chrissyteigen What are the quake details? The earthquake was of magnitude 6.9, according to the US Geological Survey. It struck at 19:46 local time (11:46 GMT) on Sunday at a fairly shallow depth of 31km (19 miles). There have been more than 130 aftershocks since the quake hit. Lombok is a roughly 4,500 sq km (1,700 sq miles) island east of the slightly larger island of Bali. The two islands are home to about three and four million people respectively. Both are popular with tourists who visit beaches and hiking trails. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. More than half of the world's active volcanoes above sea level are part of the ring. Have you been affected by the earthquake?

Meghan Bartels,"Everything was going smoothly — until NASA astronaut Nick Hague felt a sudden tremor. ""The first thing I really noticed was being shaken pretty violently side to side,"" he said during his first publicly broadcast interviews since his Soyuz rocket failed shortly after liftoff on Oct. 11. The rocket was meant to carry Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin to the International Space Station in what would have been the American's first trip to space. Instead, the pair's emergency rescue system kicked into action after a problem during booster separation. This is the shimmy that the crew experienced during booster separation - broadcast by NASA, and looped here. So happy they are safe!! More about the launch failure: https://t.co/Ws3Qu97BWK pic.twitter.com/JH2N3ROMqA — Steve Spaleta (@stevespaleta) October 11, 2018 Their capsule separating from the troubled booster was the source of that shaking, and it was accompanied by an emergency light and alarm. Together, those signs told the two astronauts that their job description for the day had just been rewritten — instead of reaching the space station, it was now just to make it back to Earth safely. [ In Photos: Space Station Crew's Harrowing Abort Landing After Soyuz Launch Failure ] Hague and Ovchinin turned to their emergency manuals and got to work navigating the sudden landing. But while Hague had been through simulations of all sorts of midflight events, he had never flown to space before, which meant he wasn't always sure whether an experience was typical of spaceflight or unique to their abrupt journey. ""Everything was new for me, it was my first time,"" Hague said, thanking Ovchinin for sharing his previous experience during the landing. ""He was able to tell me what was normal, what was not normal."" Shortly after its launch on Oct. 11, a Soyuz rocket malfunctioned, causing the crewmembers to experience an emergency landing. Credit: Bill Ingalls/NASA Hague compared his flight path to tossing a ball in the air, with the safety mechanism carrying the astronauts from the point where they separated from the rocket up to the high point of that path. ""I got to experience a few seconds of weightlessness and I was able to watch a few things float around in the capsule"" at the peak, he said. He also took the opportunity to look out the window — not solely to admire Earth and space, but also to check how the spacecraft was positioned. ""My eyes were looking out the window trying to gauge exactly where we were going to be,"" Hague said. ""Were we going to end up landing in water? Were we going to be on the steppes of Kazakhstan? Did we make it far enough downrange that we were in hillier, more mountainous terrain?"" Then, it was time to come back down, and that's where the going got rough for a bit. ""There's a whole series of events that we monitor as we are on our way back down,"" Hague said. That includes monitoring the capsule's orientation and how systems are responding to different inputs. It also meant preparing physically for re-entry, making sure they were able to breathe normally while experiencing so much gravity. ""We needed to be prepared to endure the 7 g's that we were going to experience,"" Hague said. That's more than during a standard landing (about 5 g's) but less than the 8 or so that astronauts are exposed to during training before they fly. There were other preparations to make as well. ""We needed to be ready for the opening shock of the [para]chutes and make sure all of our gear was in place, and then we have to work with the rescue teams,"" Hague said, adding that as soon as the parachutes opened, it was just like any other Soyuz landing. [ Here's What the Failed Soyuz Rocket Launch Looked Like to an Astronaut in Space ] ""Thirty-four minutes may seem like a long time, but I can tell you it seemed like a pretty quick instant from the time that the emergency happened to the time that I was landed in the capsule looking out my window,"" Hague said. And just like that, they had done it, surviving the first crewed launch failure on a Soyuz rocket since 1983. ""The first moment I was able to take a deep breath in this whole ordeal was after we came to a skidding stop in our capsule,"" Hague said. ""My window was about 12 inches [30 centimeters] from the dirt that was outside and I was able to look through that and just breathe in and take a moment and realize just how lucky we were."" Quickly, he changed his mind, and once again turned the spotlight to the people who made his safe landing possible. ""Maybe lucky's not the right word,"" Hague said. ""I think fortunate is the right word, because as I've mentioned before, there are just thousands of people that are working tirelessly to put the systems in place, those very systems that saved us last Thursday.""

Allison Hussey,"Aly Spaltros music has always been verbose in a way thats as delightful as it is overwhelming. It takes two, three, four listens to catch up with her as she describes her world in painstaking detail. Her anecdotes are unusually specific: On Billions of Eyes, she sings of racing to make the train, only to discover that all of its passengers were rooting for her to succeed.
On Even in the Tremor, her second LP as Lady Lamb (third, counting one earlier LP she released as Lady Lamb the Beekeeper), Spaltros focus shifts toward the troubles and anxieties of a late-twenty/early-thirtysomething, a striking contrast to the romps of 2013s Ripely Pine and 2015s After, where she unspooled her hopes and worries at an upbeat, energetic clip. Though her breathless exuberance may have faded, her incisive commentary is as sharp as ever.
Spaltros inclination toward maximum wordplay serves her well. Lines that might be flimsy standing alone (The past will kill the present if I let it, from the title track) are bolstered with startling moments of claritythe kinds of breakthroughs that usually require hours on a therapists couch. Like Annie Dillard reveling in the woods, Spaltro examines emotions and sensations in microscopic detail. Her vivid observations amplify nuance and color, giving her songs a synesthetic quality: the smells of bourbon and bonfires, licking birthday-cake frosting off her fingers, juicy berries dripping in the hands of teenagers.
Her straightforward indie-rock arrangements are unobtrusive throughout Even in the Tremortheyre neither killer nor filler, clever enough to hold interest without overshadowing Spaltros lyric-writing. Electric guitars and drums mostly chug along, peaking with the heart-quickening Strange Maneuvers, while piano and strings lend heartfelt gravitas to Deep Love and a somber side to Without a Name. On closer Emily, a loose touch of pedal steel makes for a fitting, hazy complement to the songs golden-hour nostalgia.
Little Flaws and Deep Love, the albums first two tracks, make a tidy and compelling package deal of Spaltros greatest strengths. With Little Flaws, she casts an empathetic eye on her partner: Youve got little flaws just like me/You try to be hard but I know youre a softie, she croons over a plunking rhythm as strings and electronics glide nimbly in the middle. On Deep Love, she celebrates her neighbors doting on their pets and other serendipitous moments of tenderness. There isnt a name for the ambient warmth of stumbling upon those small moments of kindness or empathy, so Spaltro describes it in her own wordy fashion: Passing through a good scene in somebody elses life fills my cup. (Shes since started a social-media campaign to encourage others to share their own heartwarming moments.)
Spaltro also digs into spiritual questions with frank vulnerability, expanding her internal inventories to include the greater baggage of adulthood and the even bigger questions inherent to being human. In Young Disciple, she recalls watching her parents, born-again Christians, get baptized in a kiddie pool; in another striking detail, she remembers her mother explaining the Second Coming over fast-food milkshakes. This storytelling serves a deeper purpose. As she explores the things about her mother that she doesnt understand, she recognizes that they share the same essential existential fears.
With her thoroughly detailed accounts of everyday life, Spaltro offers the comforting affirmation that complicated, hard-to-identify feelings arent so strange after all. Her songs, stuffed with information and emotion, act as an extended reminder to appreciate the gentler things the world has to offerproof that even in the tremors of everyday life at its most confusing, kindness, calm, and empathy still have ample room to grow.","The Brooklyn singer-songwriter’s third album takes a microscope to the messy business of being human, finding revelatory moments of empathy in the smallest everyday details.",2019-04-11T05:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Pitchfork.com'}",Lady Lamb: Even in the Tremor,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lady-lamb-even-in-the-tremor/,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5c6f24432602576fb0b6dd5c/2:1/w_1000/LadyLamb_EvenInTheTremor.jpg,,Pitchfork.com,tremor,1
"Associated Press, Associated Press","An Indonesian man is pictured walking inside a damaged room in the Banyumas regional public hospital after a 6.5-magnitude earthquake in Banyumas, Central Java, Indonesia killed at least two people. (Photo: Bayu Nur, EPA-EFE) JAKARTA, Indonesia — A strong earthquake shook Indonesia’s densely populated Java island on Friday night, killing two people and severely damaging dozens of homes near the epicenter. The magnitude-6.5 quake struck at 11:47 p.m. and was felt across the island, including about 200 kilometers (124 miles) away in the capital Jakarta, where office towers and apartment buildings swayed. Powerful tremors lasted as much as 30 seconds in places. Panicking people ran out of buildings in many areas and roads were clogged with motorbikes, cars and trucks as people fled coastal areas in fear of a tsunami. Ahmad Solihin, a food vendor in a coastal area of the Sukabumi region, said his village was jolted by a 20-second tremor that cracked walls in his home. He fled on his motorbike with his wife and two children after neighbors shouted that water was coming, he said. “People suddenly started running so I joined them,” said Solihin. More than 1,000 villagers in his area evacuated to higher ground and didn’t return until Saturday morning after authorities convinced them it was safe, he said. A 62-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman were killed in building collapses, said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. Damage was heaviest in the Tasikmalaya, Pangandaran and Ciamis regions of West Java Province near the epicenter. More than 40 houses collapsed and about 65 suffered severe damage, said Nugroho. The earthquake was about 91 kilometers (56 miles) deep and located just inland, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It triggered a tsunami warning for parts of Java’s coastline that was lifted about two hours later. No significant waves were reported. Several hospitals were damaged by the shaking and patients evacuated. Indonesia sits on the “Pacific Ring of Fire” and has frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

Ryan Leas,"When today’s indie luminaries talk about their major influences, Pearl Jam isn’t exactly a name that comes up a lot. But Annie Clark’s love of Pearl Jam is well-documented — she, in fact, credits “Jeremy” as the song that convinced her to pursue music. She’s also shared the stage with the ’90s legends before, and once offered up a beautiful reading of their heartbreaking classic “Black.” Clark is currently touring behind her brilliant new album MASSEDUCTION — one of the best albums of 2017 — and before her show in Asheville last night, she tried out a deeper cut from Pearl Jam’s history. (She has good taste when it comes to these pre-show warmup covers.) Compared to some of the more enraged numbers on the band’s caustic 1994 album Vitalogy, “ Tremor Christ ” is a queasy, frayed midtempo track. Approaching it solo, Clark’s version may be even more unnerving than the original — the combination of how she plays this on an acoustic and her plaintive vocals make it sound like music for a haunted house. And because Clark only uploaded part of the song, we mostly don’t get the release of the original’s chorus and outro, just the verse’s swirling, seasick tension. Of course, Clark’s proven herself to be adept at covers, so it sounds great, and you can check it out below.

Cory Doctorow,"Walmart self-insures its workforce, rather than relying on an outside insurer like Cigna or Blue Cross; this means that it gets to make judgment calls that other firms cannot, and that has led the retail giant to a pretty weird place: for certain procedures that it believes to be overused by local hospitals, it flies its employees (even front-line, low-waged employees) to see the nation's top specialists in out-of-state facilities where they receive ""concierge, white-glove care that was reserved at other companies only for highly paid executives.""
Walmart has written up the results of its program in an HBR case-study that details the company's mandatory policy that its employees be treated for spinal issues, cancer diagnoses and heart surgeries at the Mayo Clinic and others, including Pennsylvania's Geisinger Medical Center.
American hospitals are notorious for opaque billing practices and rampant price-gouging, a phenomenon that is only exacerbated by their adversarial relationships with insurers, with the two parties locked in an arms race to generate and deny charges.
Bill, an employee at Walmart, had been suffering from mild neck pain and a tremor in his hands. A local surgeon recommended spine surgery as the next course of action.
Walmart decided to send him and his wife on a flight to a hospital in another state, all expenses paid, so he could get a second opinion. He saw a team of clinicians at Geisinger Medical Center, a top hospital system in Pennsylvania. They noticed a subtle shuffle in his step and diagnosed him with Parkinsons Disease.
The employee avoided a painful, expensive surgery that he did not need. Walmart (which is self-insured) saved about $30,000 it would have paid for that surgery, and it also benefited when Bill went back to work after his symptoms improved. Geisinger got paid for the consult.

Jeremy Page,"A large part of North Korea’s underground nuclear test facility is unusable due to the collapse of a cavity inside the mountain after the latest test-detonation occurred, according to Chinese seismologists involved in a soon-to-be-published study. The experts, led by researchers at the University of Science and Technology of China, warned that another blast in the same spot and with similar yield to the one on Sept. 3 could cause “environmental catastrophe.” Another study, led by Chinese seismologists and published this month, also concluded that a secondary tremor shortly after the blast was caused by the cavity’s collapse, but made no judgment on whether the Punggye-ri test site could still be used. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced on Saturday that he was suspending nuclear and missile tests and closing the Punggye-ri facility, where all six of his country’s nuclear tests took place.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"MATARAM, Indonesia (Reuters) - Daybreak revealed chaos and destruction across the Indonesian resort island of Lombok on Monday after a magnitude 6.9 earthquake killed at least 83 people and prompted an exodus of tourists rattled by the second powerful quake in a week. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said the death toll was expected to rise with initial reports of hundreds injured and thousands of buildings collapsed or badly damaged. Power and communications were cut in some areas of Lombok, and the military said it was sending in a vessel with medical aid, supplies and logistical support for the island. Lombok was hit a week earlier, on July 29, by a 6.4 magnitude quake that killed 17 people, injured hundreds and briefly stranded several trekkers on the slopes of a volcano. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) said that more than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening’s quake, whose magnitude the U.S. Geological Survey revised down to 6.9 from an original 7.0. The tremor was so powerful it was felt on the neighboring island of Bali where, according to BNPB, two people died. “I was at the rooftop of my hotel and the building started swaying very hard. It felt like two meters to the left, then two meters to the right, I could not stand up,” said Gino Poggiali, a 43-year-old Frenchman, who was with his wife and two children. His wife Maude, 44, said the family were on Bali for the first quake and Lombok for the second. “This is it for me in Indonesia,” she said. “Next time we will stay in France or somewhere close.” Long lines formed at the airport of Lombok’s main town, Mataram, as foreign visitors cut their holidays short. The Garuda Indonesia airline said it was adding extra flights from Lombok to help tourists leave, and AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted that the budget airline would try to lay on extra flights. SCREAMS, SHAKING BUILDINGS Carlos Romartinez, a 24-year-old Spaniard who was also waiting for a flight out of Lombok, said he had decided to head instead to the island of Flores to the east. “All the activities are shut down. We can’t dive, we can’t do anything so we will go to another island,” he said. Dutch tourist Marc Ganbuwalba injured his knee as a stampede of diners rushed from a restaurant after the quake. “We are cutting short our holiday because I can’t walk and we’re just not in the mood anymore, more in the mood to see our loved ones,” said the 26-year-old, sitting on a trolley with his leg bandaged. “We are just thankful to god and also to the hotel staff who really helped us. Some of them said their own houses had been destroyed but they were still helping us.” About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists were evacuated in boats from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said via Twitter. No tourists died on the Gilis, he said. Singapore Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who was on the 10th floor of a hotel in Mataram when the quake struck, said that his room shook violently and walls cracked. “It was quite impossible to stand up. Heard screams. Came out, and made my way down a staircase, while building was still shaking. Power went out for a while. Lots of cracks, fallen doors,” he wrote on Facebook. His government issued a travel notice on Monday, advising citizens to defer travel to Lombok and urging those currently there to leave. “We were knocked certainly to the floor. We were pretty lucky to get out. Everyone’s a bit shaken but all well,” Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, who was on the 12th floor of a Lombok hotel, told Australian radio.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Train and subway services in Tokyo were temporarily suspended An emergency earthquake warning sent to millions of people in Japan caused a brief panic on Friday and disrupted Tokyo's transport network. But the loud alert, which was sent to millions of mobile phones, turned out to be a false alarm triggered by an error in the earthquake warning system. ""An earthquake has occurred off the coast of Ibaraki,"" the message read. ""Prepare for strong jolts."" Train services were suspended but there were no reports of injuries or damage. Officials believe the alert, sent by the Japan Meteorological Agency, was caused by the early warning system misreading two minor earthquakes as one larger one. The agency, which is investigating the false alarm, estimated that a 6.4 magnitude earthquake would hit off the coast of the Ibaraki prefecture in north-eastern Japan. Instead, a 4.4 magnitude quake struck at 11:02 (02:02 GMT) with a 3.9 magnitude tremor also hitting 350km (217 miles) to the west. Both occurred off the coast and were not felt on land. ""We suspect that the system overestimated it by calculating the two separate quakes as one big quake,"" an official said. Television footage showed Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe checking his mobile phone as alarms echoed around his office. Public broadcaster NHK also warned residents to protect themselves and to stay away from unstable furniture. Earthquake Early Warning alerts are sent to mobile phones, public speakers, radios and televisions in all the regions predicted to experience strong shaking. This is not the first time a false alarm has triggered panic in Japan. In August 2016, an alert warned of a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake that never came.

There was the massive gallery watching his every swing, and the roars reverberated throughout the course.

The way Brooks Koepka played on Sunday, Tiger couldn't afford any room for error. Woods finished with a tremendous 64, and it could have been a historic day had these shots played out another way. The putt on 11 Seriously, though, how didn't that go in? Where is a strong gust of wind or a minor tremor when you need it? The shot was reminiscent of his chip on 16 from the 2005 Masters, but unlike 2005, Tiger didn't have that one more rotation. Tiger would settle for par on the 11th. Bogey on 14 So close.

It was centimeters away from dropping and giving Tiger a momentum-building par. Instead, he had to work to regroup (he birdied the next hole) after a deflating bogey. His drive on 17 ( NSFW language ) For Tiger to have a chance, he absolutely needed a quality drive on the par-5 17th. At worst, he knew it would realistically take a birdie to give him any hopes of forcing a playoff. Tiger didn't get what he needed at all. His tee shot sailed into a hazard, forcing Tiger to grind out a par. He would finish a great tournament off with a birdie on 18 (good for a second-place 14-under), but Koepka ultimately captured the title at 16-under.

BryanRobinson,"My courage is faith—faith in the eternal resilience of me—that joy’ll come back, and hope and spontaneity. —F. Scott Fitzgerald At this writing, I can bench press 150 pounds. It wasn’t easy. I put everything I had into it. My personal trainer kept saying, “Let me see your tremor of truth.” Raising an eyebrow at her, I grunted and trembled and sweated before reaching the goal, but I got there. She explained later that the phrase “tremor of truth” is used in physical fitness circles when we push ourselves to the max. Lifting weights, we grimace as a tremor of unease shoots through the body. Our arm muscles quiver during pushups. Our legs tremble with exhaustion running a marathon. The brain says we can’t do it, but just as grass grows through concrete, we persevere, discovering mental and physical reserves we didn’t know we had. And just before giving up, we push through the challenge. So what does working out have to do with writing? Some literary agents say the number one key to writing success—even more important than good writing—is resilience, dogged determination in the face of disappointment. Tremor of truth builds muscles on the physical plane and a growth mindset on the psychological plane. Meteoric writing obstacles often seem too great, as if we’re pushing through relentless steel, a vein of encased ore: an impossible deadline, a heartbreaking rejection, impassible writer’s block, a lousy review, sounds of crickets at book signings, or the rumble of our own self-doubt. Sometimes the setbacks make it too hard to bounce back. The hole feels too deep, too dark, the disillusionment too wide and overwhelming. Over time rejections and disappointments nibble away at us like torture from half a million cuts. It starts to feel as if we’re bleeding to death and can’t tolerate one more slash. Statistics say more of us have the stamina to continue to take safety risks after a car crash than to continue after a series of psychological defeats. After repeated failure, many writers throw in the towel to avoid more disappointment. Attempts to bring quick relief to the misery of defeat rob us of knowing what missed opportunities lay beyond the barrier. This impulsive reaction—scientists call it the what-the-hell effect—is a way out: permission to give up. Adding insult to injury, we seek comfort in the very thing we’re trying to conquer: writing failure. Although growth as a writer is painful, it can be even more painful to remain tight in a secure little nest. Craft alone won’t carry us through the massive writing hurdles. When we’re knocked down in the writing arena, the heartbreak slams the wind out of us. Our faces marred by dust and sweat and blood, we push ourselves up on our scabby knees stagger to our feet, and summon the courage to try again. Just when we’re ready to give up, one more tremor unearths a second wind and a vein of resilience that we didn’t know we had. A sudden jolt sizzles through us, and we’re fueled with pit-bull determination. One extra push and we plough through the smackdown moments that had brought us to our knees, moving over the finish line. You can build a growth mindset by waiting for your reserves to kick in and learning how much more you’re capable of. If you give up too soon, you’ll never know if you had it in you to pull it off. And that’s a tough unknown to live with. In the heat of the moment, ask if you’re pushing hard and far enough through the gray mist of uncertainty. Or do you need to amp up your efforts? And how far do you stretch before reaching your breaking point? Most of us can go farther than we think we can. The term “springback” refers to a process when metal returns to its original shape after undergoing compression and tension (stretching). We, too, have an elastic limit to which we can stretch to a certain point before returning to our original shape. Springback moments happen after failure, mistakes, or hopelessness over seemingly impossible odds, preventing us from giving up on our writing dreams, no matter how improbable they seem. Here are ways your “tremor of truth” can mine the hidden reserves you didn’t know you had—golden opportunities to cultivate a growth mindset and push through veins of writing hardships: 1. Grow thick skin and expect writing rejections and setbacks. Commit yourself in advance to facing the many smackdowns you will encounter like all successful writers before you. 2. Ditch the desire for comfort and step into writing’s growth pains. Be willing to go to the edge of your emotional pain so you can be fully present with what lays beyond the barrier. 3. Cultivate creative sustainability. Think of yourself as an elastic band that bends and stretches to a certain point before you spring back higher than you fall. 4. Turn roadblocks into steppingstones. Pinpoint opportunity contained in difficulty. Make it a goal to use negative writing challenges—no matter how painful, frustrating, big or small—as lessons from which to learn. Ask, “What can I manage or overcome here?” or “How can I turn this matter around to my advantage?” 5. Refer to previous experience. Reflect on past writing obstacles you’ve overcome. Point to lessons learned and underscore ways you have grown stronger through writing’s hard knocks. 6. Take risks. Find that one place in your writing where you’ve been hiding, then stick your neck out from your comfort zone. Ask what edge you can go to in your writing. Seek out risky writing experiences that help you bloom instead of low-risk situations that keep you safe in a bud. 7. Identify self-doubts that have cramped your writing style or crippled you from growing fully as a writer. Harness them—instead of running from them—and channel them into useful writing so they don’t paralyze you. 8. Stay off the roller coaster. Manage the ups-and-downs of your writing practice by treating highs and lows equally. Celebrate the highs but don’t take them anymore seriously than the lows, and don’t take downturns anymore seriously than upswings. 9. Eschew the what-the-hell effect. This attitude only adds insult to injury. Face writing letdowns by taking the towel you want to throw in and use it to wipe the sweat off your face then hop back into your writing saddle. 10. Stop throwing the book at yourself and catch yourself when you fall. After a setback or discouraging situation, we bounce back to our writing quicker when we support ourselves with loving-kindness. Instead of kicking yourself when you’re down, be on your own side, wish yourself well, and be your best advocate as you progress on your writing journey.","You're reading What is a Tremor of Truth?, originally posted on Pick the Brain | Motivation and Self Improvement.

Johnny Strategy,"﻿ Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves are lovely, and can act as a robust focal point in any home, though accessing the high shelves can be a problem. The common sidekick has always been ladders which can also add character and charm, but for smaller homes like in Japan they can be a nuisance, occupying too much space for not enough usage. Japanese architect Shinsuke Fujii came up with a simple, yet brilliant solution that solves another problem too: earthquake safety. The “ House in Shinyoshida,” as it’s called, named for the neighborhood in Yokohama where it stands, was conceived shortly after the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. The client, who happened to be an avid book lover, approached Fujii with the task to design a home around a large bookshelf that’s both easily accessible but also one that won’t spill all the books if there’s ever a tremor. The solution was to slant the entire western-facing façade and create a built-in slanted bookshelf whose shelves also function as a ladder. The slant allows family members of all ages to climb up and reach books, but also keeps the books from falling should an earthquake ever shake the home. The slanted façade also has the effect of creating an open feeling in the family room, where the home’s high perch allows for plenty of sunlight to enter through the large windows.

Rob Beschizza,"Surgeons at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore successfully completed the world's first scrotum-included penis transplant last month, restoring cock and balls to a soldier maimed by an IED in Afghanistan. The 14-hour operation took place March 26 and involved nine plastic surgeons and two urological surgeons, transplanting the penis, scrotum and partial abdominal wall from a dead donor. Doctors from the same team also performed America's first bilateral arm transplant. The donor's testes were not transplanted due to ethical guidelines, as the new owner may otherwise produce offspring with the donor's genetics. The recipient will not be able to father children. “We are hopeful that this transplant will help restore near-normal urinary and sexual functions for this young man,” W.P.

The anonymous recipient is delighted with his new equipment: “When I first woke up, I felt finally more normal… [with] a level of confidence as well.

Seamus Bellamy,"If you're not already wearing a tinfoil hat, it may be a good time to start: a pair of engineers based out of the University of Michigan have figured out a way to create a light-powered camera sensor that's only a millimeter in size: small enough to be practically invisible to a casual observer. According to a paper published in IEEE Electron Device Letters by Euisik Yoon and Sung-Yun Park, the new camera has the potential to not only be insanely small, but also, self sustaining, thanks to a solar panel placed directly behind the camera's image sensor, which is thin enough that light, in addition to what's needed to create an image, is able to pass right through it. This could provide the camera with all the power it needs to be able to continue to capture images, indefinitely. At a maximum of 15 frames per second, the images it captures aren't of the best quality, but they're more than adequate for creeping on an unsuspecting subject. The good news is that, for the time being, the camera is nothing more than a proof-of-concept. In order for it to be deployed in the real world as a near-invisible surveillance device, someone a lot smarter than me will need to figure out how to store image data and transmit it using hardware that's just as discrete as the camera's image sensor and power source are.

Kevin Loria,"USGS expects this sort of damage to occur when the Hayward Fault earthquake hits. USGS/Public Domain On this day 112 years ago, the San Andreas Fault under San Francisco rumbled apart, causing the devastating 1906 earthquake that swallowed city blocks, broke water mains, and triggered massive fires that burned for days. The threat of another major quake for the Bay Area is ""real and could happen at any time,"" according to researchers for the US Geological Survey. But the scariest scenario for the next major earthquake may not be from the San Andreas Fault (though that one still threatens ), but from the Hayward Fault that runs along the east side of the San Francisco Bay. The Hayward Fault is a ""tectonic time bomb, due anytime for another magnitude 6.8 to 7.0 earthquake,"" according to a 2008 USGS report. Since then, research has indicated that the likelihood of a Hayward quake is greater and more threatening to the 7 million Bay Area residents than a San Andreas quake would be. ""It's just waiting to go off,"" USGS earthquake geologist emeritus David Schwartz told the Los Angeles Times. The Hayward Fault USGS/Public Domain The HayWired Earthquake Scenario To better understand what might happen in the case of a quake on the Hayward Fault, researchers from the USGS partnered with a group called the HayWired Coalition. They modeled a hypothetical 7.0 magnitude quake with an epicenter beneath Oakland — a hypothetical event they call the HayWired Scenario. The projections are sobering. According to that model, the violent shaking from the earthquake could cause the two sides of the fault to split six feet apart in some places. Some aftershocks could continue for several months. Cities in the East Bay would be hit hard, including Berkeley, Oakland, San Leandro, and Hayward. More than 300 buildings sit atop the Hayward Fault, including the stadium at the University of California Berkeley. Property damage in the HayWired Scenario is estimated by USGS to be more than $82 billion. The human toll from such an event could be greater. The quake would displace 77,000 households, a number that could rise to 152,000 if fires and utility outages were counted. That means nearly half a million people would be forced from their homes. A major earthquake in 1989 rocked the San Francisco Bay area and damaged parts of the Bay Bridge. AP Photo The scientists think such an event would kill around 800 people and cause 18,000 nonfatal injuries. More than 2,500 people might need to be pulled from collapsed buildings, and around 22,000 could be trapped in elevators. Most counties in the area would have full water service restored within 30 days, the researchers estimate, but it might take up to 210 days before the hardest hit counties would see full service restored. More than 400 gas- and electric-related fires would likely ignite because of the main shock of the quake, and experts think those blazes could burn an area big enough to consume 52,000 homes, kill hundreds, and do another $30 billion in damage. The 72 percent probability of a magnitude (M) 6.7 or greater earthquake in the region includes well-known major plate-boundary faults, lesser-known faults, and unknown faults. The percentage shown within each colored circle is the probability that a M 6.7 or greater earthquake will occur somewhere on that fault system by the year 2043. The dark, thick lines outlined in various colors represent major plate boundary faults; the thinner, yellow lines mark lesser-know, smaller faults. USGS/Public Domain Another quake is coming The last time a major quake hit the Hayward Fault was in 1868, when a 6.8-magnitude tremor raced through the region and leveled several towns. The region was sparsely populated then, but 30 people died and the impact was powerful enough that the 1868 quake is considered one of the most destructive in California history. People felt the shakes as far north as Nevada. The devastation from the next quake will be worse given the current density of the East Bay. The idea behind the HayWired Scenario is to present a realistic model of something experts think is likely to happen — and inspire more investment in earthquake safety. There are steps that experts think could improve the situation. An early warning system could prevent at least 1,500 injuries if people followed alerts. If water utilities replace brittle pipes, acquire emergency generators, and create a fuel-management plan, water service could be restored more quickly. Retrofitting buildings could also reduce the number of fires. But the researchers behind the analysis want people to understand that this scenario is just one of many possibilities. There are seven significant fault lines running through the Bay Area. The risk from a Hayward quake might be highest, but there are worse scenarios that would involve multiple faults rupturing simultaneously. Overall, researchers think there's about a 76% chance the region could get hit by a 7.2 magnitude quake within the next 30 years. As Schwartz told the LA Times, ""You can't hide — there's really going to be very little places in the greater Bay Area that won't be affected.""","There's about a 76% chance that the San Francisco Bay Area could experience a 7.2 magnitude earthquake within the next 30 years, according to some recent reports.

John Brandon,"A big decision is looming on the horizon, You feel the tremor, you hear the footsteps off in the distance. Many of us don't like pulling a lever and opening a door to a new endeavor, mostly because we can't predict the future or know if anything will work out. And, some of the steps you might take to make the decision--like making a pro-con list--don't help that much. In my experience, it's better to ask yourself these four tough questions. 1. Will it challenge me? The easy decision is not always the best decision. When I first decided to be a writer in 2001, it wasn't without a lot of restless nights, wrestling with the idea of abandoning my corporate career. Other than being one of the best decisions I've ever made, the part that ""hooked"" me is that I needed a new challenge. Finding another job would have been difficult, but starting a writing career from ground zero is much more challenging (and, for me, rewarding). Challenges stretch us, make us better--they push us to greater things. 2. Will I become an example to others? Your kids, your friends--a colleague who sits next to you. You can be an example to them of what it's like to act decisively and without regret. If you're a mother or father, sometimes a tough decision might linger for a while, but if you charge ahead, it can help your kids see what conviction to a cause looks like. I'm not saying to become a doormat that makes decisions only for the benefit of others. I am saying there are people watching what you do. Make sure it is the right decision, but act without constant hesitation and analysis. 3. Is it slightly dangerous? Most of us like the safe route. It's just... safer. For someone who is choosing between two good job offers, or making a life decision like who to marry or whether to have kids, or even when you are planning a vacation and deciding where to go, it can be hard to know which good thing is the best thing. One piece of advice? Try picking something that's a little dangerous and even risky. Go ahead and marry that person! Pick the job that involves travel to China. Buy that plane ticket to Ecuador and head out on a mountain trail. The safe route sometimes leads to boredom...and a lot less excitement in life. 4. In five years, will I play the what-if game? I'm not a fan of the pro-con list for big decisions, mostly because we usually know what we like or don't like. We tend to pad the results. Yet, other than analyzing and evaluating all of the variables, think hard about how this decision will impact your life. Say it's a new job. You have to leave your current job, move to a new area, and maybe even find new friends. There are pros and cons, but in the end, you don't have to figure out if you will have regrets about making the new decision. You have to figure out if you will regret not making the decision. Project out a few years--will your future self still play the what-if game?",Forget making a list. Ask these questions to force yourself into the right frame of mind.,2018-03-26T08:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Need to Make a Hard Decision?

"Miles Bodmer, Doug Toomey, The Conversation US","The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research. The Pacific Northwest is known for many things—its beer, its music, its mythical large-footed creatures. Most people don’t associate it with earthquakes, but they should. It’s home to the Cascadia megathrust fault that runs 600 miles from Northern California up to Vancouver Island in Canada, spanning several major metropolitan areas including Seattle and Portland, Oregon. This geologic fault has been relatively quiet in recent memory. There haven’t been many widely felt quakes along the Cascadia megathrust, certainly nothing that would rival a catastrophic event like the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake along the active San Andreas in California. That doesn’t mean it will stay quiet, though. Scientists know it has the potential for large earthquakes—as big as magnitude 9. Geophysicists have known for over a decade that not all portions of the Cascadia megathrust fault behave the same. The northern and southern sections are much more seismically active than the central section—with frequent small earthquakes and ground deformations that residents don’t often notice. But why do these variations exist and what gives rise to them? Our research tries to answer these questions by constructing images of what’s happening deep within the Earth, more than 100 kilometers below the fault. We’ve identified regions that are rising up beneath these active sections which we think are leading to the observable differences along the Cascadia fault. Cascadia and the ‘Really Big One’ The Cascadia subduction zone is a region where two tectonic plates are colliding. The Juan de Fuca, a small oceanic plate, is being driven under the North American plate, atop which the continental U.S. sits. Subduction systems—where one tectonic plate slides over another—are capable of producing the world’s largest known earthquakes. A prime example is the 2011 Tohoku earthquake that rocked Japan. Cascadia is seismically very quiet compared to other subduction zones—but it’s not completely inactive. Research indicates the fault ruptured in a magnitude 9.0 event in 1700. That’s roughly 30 times more powerful than the largest predicted San Andreas earthquake. Researchers suggest that we are within the roughly 300- to 500-year window during which another large Cascadia event may occur. Many smaller undamaging and unfelt events take place in northern and southern Cascadia every year. However, in central Cascadia, underlying most of Oregon, there is very little seismicity. Why would the same fault behave differently in different regions? Over the last decade, scientists have made several additional observations that highlight variations along the fault. One has to do with plate locking, which tells us where stress is accumulating along the fault. If the tectonic plates are locked—that is, really stuck together and unable to move past each other—stress builds. Eventually that stress can be released rapidly as an earthquake, with the magnitude depending on how large the patch of fault that ruptures is. Geologists have recently been able to deploy hundreds of GPS monitors across Cascadia to record the subtle ground deformations that result from the plates’ inability to slide past each other. Just like historic seismicity, plate locking is more common in the northern and southern parts of Cascadia. Geologists are also now able to observe difficult-to-detect seismic rumblings known as tremor. These events occur over the time span of several minutes up to weeks, taking much longer than a typical earthquake. They don’t cause large ground motions even though they can release significant amounts of energy. Researchers have only discovered these signals in the last 15 years, but permanent seismic stations have helped build a robust catalog of events. Tremor, too, seems to be more concentrated along the northern and southern parts of the fault. What would cause this situation, with the area beneath Oregon relatively less active by all these measures? To explain we had to look deep, over 100 kilometers below the surface, into the Earth’s mantle. Imaging the Earth using distant quakes Physicians use electromagnetic waves to “see” internal structures like bones without needing to open up a human patient to view them directly. Geologists image the Earth in much the same way. Instead of X-rays, we use seismic energy radiating out from distant magnitude 6.0-plus earthquakes to help us “see” features we physically just can’t get to. This energy travels like sound waves through the structures of the Earth. When rock is hotter or partially molten by even a tiny amount, seismic waves slow down. By measuring the arrival times of seismic waves, we create 3D images showing how fast or slow the seismic waves travel through specific parts of the Earth. To see these signals, we need records from seismic monitoring stations. More sensors provide better resolution and a clearer image—but gathering more data can be problematic when half the area you’re interested in is underwater. To address this challenge, we were part of a team of scientists that deployed hundreds of seismometers on the ocean floor off the western U.S. over the span of four years, starting in 2011. This experiment, the Cascadia Initiative, was the first ever to cover an entire tectonic plate with instruments at a spacing of roughly 50 kilometers. What we found are two anomalous regions beneath the fault where seismic waves travel slower than expected. These anomalies are large, about 150 kilometers in diameter, and show up beneath the northern and southern sections of the fault. Remember, that’s where researchers have already observed increased activity: the seismicity, locking, and tremor. Interestingly, the anomalies are not present beneath the central part of the fault, under Oregon, where we see a decrease in activity. So what exactly are these anomalies? The tectonic plates float on the Earth’s rocky mantle layer. Where the mantle is slowly rising over millions of years, the rock decompresses. Since it’s at such high temperatures, nearly 1500 degrees Celsius at 100 km depth, it can melt ever so slightly. These physical changes cause the anomalous regions to be more buoyant—melted hot rock is less dense than solid cooler rock. It’s this buoyancy that we believe is affecting how the fault above behaves. The hot, partially molten region pushes upwards on what’s above, similar to how a helium balloon might rise up against a sheet draped over it. We believe this increases the forces between the two plates, causing them to be more strongly coupled and thus more fully locked. A general prediction for where, but not when Our results provide new insights into how this subduction zone, and possibly others, behaves over geologic time frames of millions of years. Unfortunately our results can’t predict when the next large Cascadia megathrust earthquake will occur. This will require more research and dense active monitoring of the subduction zone, both onshore and offshore, using seismic and GPS-like stations to capture short-term phenomena. Our work does suggest that a large event is more likely to start in either the northern or southern sections of the fault, where the plates are more fully locked, and gives a possible reason for why that may be the case. It remains important for the public and policymakers to stay informed about the potential risk involved in cohabiting with a subduction zone fault and to support programs such as Earthquake Early Warning that seek to expand our monitoring capabilities and mitigate loss in the event of a large rupture.

Lydia Denworth,"A macaque monkey sat in front of a computer. A yellow square—the target—appeared in the periphery on the left side of the screen. After a few seconds delay, a second target appeared on the right. The question was: Which target would the monkey look at first? So far so routine as neuroscience experiments go, but the next step was unusual. By non-invasively directing bursts of inaudible acoustic energy at a specific visual area of the brain, a team of scientists steered the animal’s responses. If they focused on the left side of the brain, the monkey looked to the right more often. If they focused on the right side, the monkey looked to the left more often. The results of the experiment, which were presented last week at the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting, marked the first time that focused ultrasound was safely and effectively used in a nonhuman primate to alter brain activity rather than destroy tissue. A second study, in sheep, had similar results. “The finding paves the way to noninvasive stimulation of specific brain regions in humans,” says Jan Kubanek, a neural engineer at Stanford University School of Medicine and lead author of the macaque study. The technology might ultimately be used to diagnose or treat neurological diseases and disorders like Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, addiction and depression. Other scientists are optimistic. “The idea that, with a very carefully designed dose, you could actually deliver [focused ultrasound] and stimulate the brain in the place you want and modulate a circuit rather than damage it, is a really important proof of principle,” said Helen Mayberg, MD, of Emory University School of Medicine, who was not involved with the study. Ultrasound has long been used for imaging. When sound waves above the level that humans can hear (more than 20,000 hertz) are aimed at the body, some of the energy bounces back creating a picture of internal bodily structures. Focused ultrasound, or FUS, raises the energy level to accomplish other ends. Like using a magnifying glass to focus beams of light on a single point and burn a leaf, FUS concentrates as many as 1,000 sound waves on a specific target with precision and accuracy. First approved by the Federal Drug Administration in 2004 as a treatment for uterine fibroids, focused ultrasound has gained an increasing variety of potential uses, generating excitement among many doctors. “There are 18 ways, or mechanisms of action, by which focused ultrasound affects tissue. That fact creates the opportunity to treat a whole variety of medical disorders,” says Neal Kassell, MD, former co-chair of neurosurgery at the University of Virginia and founder and chairman of the Focused Ultrasound Foundation, which seeks to speed the development and adoption of the technology. A decade ago, FUS was being investigated as a treatment for three diseases or disorders. Today that number stands at more than 90. Thus far, however, it has only been used in humans to target and destroy tissue with heat. In addition to uterine fibroids, it is approved for four other therapeutic uses in the United States. Prostate cancer was added to the list in 2015, although some urologists have been lukewarm about its use, emphasizing in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2016 that the long-term efficacy is not yet proven. In the brain, the FDA approved its use as an ablation treatment (removing tissue) for essential tremor in 2016. (In Europe, it’s more widely used.) Howard Eisenberg, professor and chief of neurosurgery at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, participated in the clinical studies of FUS as an ablative treatment for essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, targeting different brain areas for each disorder. He has found that patients like the technology because it’s less invasive than deep brain stimulation, which requires surgery to implant an electrode. “It’s not surgery really,” says Eisenberg. In addition, because FUS is so precise, says Eisenberg, “you can sculpt the lesion, you might make three ablations all close to each other.” Comparatively speaking, neuromodulation, which entails altering electrical and chemical signaling in brain circuits, requires lower doses of energy that are delivered as intermittent pulses, and is relatively far down the list of possible uses for FUS in the brain. “It’s a frontier approach,” says Eisenberg, who is more excited about using FUS to open the blood brain barrier for drug delivery But if the technique can be perfected as a method of brain stimulation it will open a new range of possibilities. It can be aimed more precisely—on the order of millimeters rather than centimeters—than transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). And it can go deeper into the brain. “I think the first opportunity is on the diagnostic side,” said Kubanek. “Disease circuitry might be variable across patients. If we can specifically stimulate regions deep in the brain and measure the reduction of tremor, that would [tell us that region is] involved in that behavior.” The next step would be to apply focused ultrasound as a method of brain stimulation for a variety of mental health and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s. Like Kubanek, Seung-Schik Yoo, professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and director of the neuromodulation lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, demonstrated successful brain stimulation using FUS at the Society for Neuroscience meeting. In sheep, Yoo and his colleagues showed that FUS could both excite and inhibit brain activity without apparent harm. But Yoo’s primary aim was to develop a wearable transcranial FUS system. His team created a small apparatus weighing only a quarter of a pound that could be worn by the sheep, whose cranial structure is similar to humans. The system consisted of a focused ultrasound transducer to generate the signal, an optical tracker and an applicator to hold the transducer over the head via an implanted pedestal. (In humans, they plan to do away with the need for implantation.) The group also developed a computer algorithm capable of predicting the intensity and location of the acoustic focus, which Yoo likened to an area the size of a large piece of orzo pasta. “The tools themselves are really changing the face of what’s possible,” Mayberg says. “Wouldn’t it be great if we could tune [brain circuitry] with ultrasound and don’t have to open the brain?” she says. That would avoid surgery and the need for periodically changing batteries. “You could wear a device like the sheep,” she adds. “We can start to dream about some innovations that are based on exquisite neuroscience.”",The prospect of focusing the beams without destroying tissue might someday diagnose or even restore faulty brain circuits -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2017-11-30T11:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Ultrasound Could Offer Noninvasive Treatment for Parkinson's and Depression,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ultrasound-could-offer-noninvasive-treatment-for-parkinson-rsquo-s-and-depression/,https://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/67788133-B315-4177-84D641C13EA55627_agenda.jpg?w=600&h=335,,Scientificamerican.com,tremor,1
Ralph Jennings & Christopher Bodeen / AP,"(TAIPEI, Taiwan) — Rescuers Wednesday morning were working to reach five people trapped and more than 170 people unaccounted for in several buildings damaged by a strong earthquake near Taiwan’s eastern coast. The shallow and powerful quake late Tuesday night caused at least four buildings in worst-hit Hualien county to cave in and tilt dangerously, killing two people. Video footage and photos showed several mid-sized buildings leaning at sharp angles, their lowest floors crushed into mangled heaps of concrete, shattered glass, bent iron beams and other debris. Firefighters could be seen climbing ladders hoisted against windows as they sought to reach residents inside apartments. The quake injured 219 people, two dozen of them critically, in Hualien county, the National Fire Agency said. The force of the tremor buckled roads and disrupted electricity and water supplies to thousands of households. The agency said most of the 173 people who could not be reached might be in the Yunmen Cuiti building, a 12-story apartment building, though it said it did not immediately have an estimate of how many were trapped. A hotel employee died when the ground floor caved in at the Marshal Hotel, and another person died in a residential building, the agency reported. A maintenance worker who was rescued after being trapped in the hotel’s basement said the force of the earthquake was unusual. “At first it wasn’t that big … we get this sort of thing all the time and it’s really nothing. But then it got really terrifying,” Chen Ming-hui said after he was reunited with his son and grandson. “It was really scary.” Other buildings shifted on their foundations due to the magnitude-6.4 quake late Tuesday and rescuers used ladders, ropes and cranes to get residents to safety. Taiwanese media reported that a separate hotel known as the Beautiful Life Hotel was tilting. Taiwan’s Central News Agency also posted photos showing a road fractured in several parts. Bridges and some highways were closed pending inspections after buckling due to the force of the quake. With aftershocks continuing through the night, residents were being directed to shelters, including a newly built baseball stadium, where beds and hot food were provided. Speaking from a crisis center in Taipei, Cabinet spokesman Hsu Kuo-yung said rail links appeared to be unaffected and the runway of Hualien airport was intact. “We’re putting a priority on Hualien people being able to return home to check on their loved ones,” Hsu said. Schools and offices in Hualien County were to be closed Wednesday, the official Central News Agency said, citing the county government. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude-6.4 quake struck just before midnight Tuesday about 21 kilometers (13 miles) northeast of Hualien at a relatively shallow depth of about 10.6 kilometers (6.6 miles). Taiwan has frequent earthquakes due to its position along the “Ring of Fire,” the seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean where most of the world’s earthquakes occur. Exactly two years earlier, a magnitude-6.4 quake collapsed an apartment complex in southern Taiwan, causing the deaths of 115 people. Five people involved in the construction of the complex were later found guilty of negligence and given prison sentences. A magnitude-7.6 quake in central Taiwan killed more than 2,300 people in 1999.",Rescuers believe most of the unaccounted for are in a 12-story apartment building,2018-02-07T03:41:03Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Rescuers Are Searching for People Trapped in Rubble After a Deadly Quake Strikes Taiwan,http://time.com/5136815/taiwan-earthquake-rescue/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gettyimages-915080270.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,tremor,1
Reuters,"It happened in Russia in 2013. Then it happened in Scotland in 2016. And once again, the value of a dashcam has been proven as motorists, among other inadvertent videographers, captured images of the meteor that exploded in the skies over Michigan on Tuesday night. The meteor lit up the sky over parts of the U.S. Midwest and Canada, weather and geology agencies said, and then caused a powerful boom that rattled homes and onlookers. A meteor that explodes and breaks apart in the upper atmosphere is called a bolide. It was seen in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Ontario at about 8 p.m. local time and registered a 2.0 magnitude tremor about 4 miles (7 km) east of Saint Clair Shores in Eastern Michigan, the United States Geological Survey said on its website. Some who saw it diffused through overcast skies thought it was thunder and lightning, while others where the skies were clearer saw the fireball. The National Weather Service (NWS) confirmed it was not a meteorological event. ""The NWS can confirm the flash and boom was NOT thunder or lightning, but instead a likely meteor,"" the NWS in Detroit said on Twitter. The meteor sighting lit up social media with people posting videos and reaction. ""I can't believe there was a Meteor! It shook our house and made a large bang! We thought someone hit our house,"" Twitter user Jennifer Wilson said in a post. In a month where a false alarm of an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile terrified the residents of Hawaii, some who saw the meteor had more ominous thoughts.

While scientists were at first baffled as to what caused this global phenomenon, they’ve now identified the cause: Will Ferrell and his doppelgänger, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, occupied the same time and space yet again. Appearing at a live performance to raise money for Cancer For College, Ferrell was on hand to warm up the crowd, emceeing for an unlikely cover band comprised of Dave Matthews Band’s Stefan Lessard, Brandi Carlisle, her band’s Tim and Phil Hanseroth, the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Josh Klinghoffer and Chad Smith, and Eddie Vedder. The group played a whole bunch of classic rock covers before moving on to the most frightening part of the night, when Smith and Ferrell stood in universe-fracturingly close proximity to one another for a performance of Depeche Mode’s “Personal Jesus.” Watch, if you dare to poke at the inconsistencies of our reality, as the two clones split the fabric of existence, laughing in the face of the absurdity of it all by playing music and telling jokes despite the obvious mental anguish that must accompany looking one another in the face. This isn’t the first time the pair have defied the natural order. Over the years, they’ve visited talk shows to see who’s the better drummer and appeared together at a previous Cancer For College event for more of the same.

Jan Strupczewski,"NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - As the euro zone sovereign debt crisis petered out, European officials at annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund were happy to move out of the spotlight over recent years. Europe was not in the eye of the storm. Until now. The IMF’s annual meetings, normally held in Washington, this year is taking place on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, where a magnitude six earthquake welcomed the world’s 20 top finance ministers on the eve of their talks. But the tremor, which awoke many of the 10,000 officials from all over he world around 3 o’clock in the morning on Thursday, turned out to be less of a conversation topic than a new menace to Europe’s financial stability - Italy. “If you talk to serious people here, everybody talks about Italy,” one European official said. Investors and bank analysts at meetings with European decision-makers were mainly interested in Italy and how the euro zone could deal with it, officials said. “The main topics at the meetings here are the trade war between the U.S. and China and Italy,” a second European participant said. “On Italy, people ask us what is likely to happen and how we are going to deal with it. They are alarmed but not in panic.” Italy’s new, populist government wants to increase borrowing over the next three years to make good on election promises of higher spending and lower taxes. But with a debt pile of 133 percent of GDP, the second highest in Europe after Greece, and relatively slow growth, Rome can hardly afford such luxuries. Markets also fret that Italian banks, saddled with bad loans, and a massive amount of Italian government bonds, could face crippling losses if debt prices keep tumbling. Financial markets reacted to the Rome’s plans with a sharp sell-off of Italian bonds - three-year yields rose to five year highs at an auction on Thursday and the benchmark 10-year paper IT10YT=TWEB traded at 4-1/2-year highs. The higher deficit also blatantly breaks European Union budget rules, enforced by the European Commission, putting Rome on a collision course with EU institutions once it sends the draft budget for EU checks on Monday. TALKING THEMSELVES INTO PANIC Many officials are privately concerned about the possibility of Italy sparking another sovereign debt crisis like the one triggered by Greece in 2010 that nearly destroyed the euro zone. Only Italy’s economy is almost 10 times bigger than Greece’s. But some also caution against doomsday scenarios. “Here in Bali, something is happening that I have seen in IMF meetings again and again. People focus on something that is difficult and then everybody talks about it and, in the end, everybody is convinced that it is much worse than before they started. That is happening now with Italy,” a third European official said. “I am worried, but it is not quite as bad as some people here make it to be. They talk themselves into a panic,” he said. Speaking at a panel on Thursday, Klaus Regling, the head of the euro zone’s bailout fund that would be called upon if Italy could no longer borrow at sustainable rates, noted the euro zone’s third biggest economy had inherent strengths. Regling stressed Italy had a primary and current account surplus, large private savings and that most of Italian debt was held domestically, which made capital flight less likely. “There is no immediate danger for Italy to lose access to the markets,” Regling told the panel. But Fitch ratings agency downgraded the outlook for Italy’s debt at the beginning of September and Moody’s is waiting until the end October to complete its review for a possible downgrade of Italy’s Baa2 rating. Standard &amp; Poor’s will assess Italy on Oct 26. Regling said he did not believe Rome would lose its investment grade rating, but other officials said that while a downgrade by two notches may be unlikely, the ratings agencies could also cut their outlook and that market reaction was difficult to predict. “Italian debt is sustainable unless there are serious policy mistakes. At the moment they are making serious policy mistakes. You can ruin any country if you do the wrong things,” the third official said.

"Anna Shiryaevskaya, Fred Pals, Mathew Carr","The tremor that rattled windows in a densely populated part of northwest Europe this week also shook the production plans for the region’s biggest natural gas field and market prices. Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV, a venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp. that previously appealed Dutch government decisions to cut production from the Groningen field, on Wednesday proposed a “substantial reduction” in output. It also suggested shutting in two of the field’s four areas, which accounted for about 5 percent of last year’s total output. The proposal, which sent wholesale prices higher and will need to be finalized by the Dutch government, comes after an earthquake on Monday measuring 3.4 on the Richter scale linked to extraction in the region, the biggest tremor since August 2012. The number of earthquakes linked to gas production had been waning after previous output cuts. “Output needs to be lowered. The question is how quickly it can be done,” Eric Wiebes, the economy minister who’s also in charge of the nation’s gas production, said late Wednesday at a New Year’s event in Groningen. “We need to look at how it can be done at the quickest pace possible.” QuickTake Q&amp;A: Earth-Shaking Woes at Europe’s Biggest Gas Field Parliament will debate the earthquake and gas extraction next week. The issue of damage to housing from gas extraction won’t be resolved at short notice and “miracles” shouldn’t be expected, Wiebes said. Gas for the winter of 2018-19 in the U.K., a European benchmark, jumped 2.2 percent Wednesday on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, its biggest daily increase in a month, and was little changed on Thursday. Winter gas in the Netherlands rose 1.2 percent Thursday, extending its weekly gain to 3.2 percent, broker data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Economy Minister should shut in six of Groningen’s 20 clusters, NAM said in a statement. The areas produced a total of 1.2 billion cubic meters of gas last year, NAM data show. “Production has been reduced significantly over the past three years,” said Angela Miller, a trader at Inenco Group Ltd. in Lytham, England. “Further production cuts would bring security of supply issues into play but the Netherlands has to weigh this up against environmental concerns.” While the field is now allowed to produce 21.6 billion cubic meters (760 billion cubic feet) a year, or about half the level in 2014, the four parties in the ruling coalition government already agreed to further cuts. Groningen is important because it produces a less rich form of gas that networks from France to Germany rely on and that isn’t easily replaced without special converter facilities. Progressive Decline Annual gas output from the Groningen gas field under new rules Source: NAM data Dutch Groningen Gas Field Production Plan Ruled Insufficient The Netherlands would have to resort to other supply sources to make up for the further decline in production. “If we cut production at too short notice, we will end up watching our televisions at 6 degrees Celsius (43 Fahrenheit),” Wiebes said Wednesday. — With assistance by Joost Akkermans, and Wout Vergauwen",The tremor that rattled windows in a densely populated part of northwest Europe this week also shook the production plans for the region’s biggest natural gas field and market prices.,2018-01-11T10:46:42Z,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",EU Gas Feels Dutch Tremors as Biggest Field Proposes Further Cut,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-10/biggest-dutch-quake-since-2012-spurs-move-to-increase-gas-cuts,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iuEHZ3BarLEw/v1/1200x800.jpg,bloomberg,Bloomberg,tremor,1
Robin George Andrews,"On November 11, 2018, a deep rumble ricocheted around the world, one that humans couldnt feel but that registered quite clearly on seismometers. A new pre-print paper about the event is now suggesting that it was caused by the largest offshore volcanic event in recorded history.
Originating 30 miles east of the island of Mayotte, near Madagascar, the mid-November signal immediately caught the attention of a disparate group of geoscientists. They subsequently took to Twitter to express their fascination over this mysterious eventone even joked about a giant prehistoric sea monster.
The rumble formed part of a prolonged seismic sequence that had started in the area back in May 2018, but the very low-frequency, potent growl in November stood out because it wasnt immediately obvious what caused it. These scientists eventually agreed that it could only have originated from a volcanic event, one involving the movement of a vast volume of magma beneath the seafloor, causing the ground there to significantly deflate.
Now, a new paper by researchers at the French Geological Survey and Frances Ecole Normale Supérieure has been uploaded to the public server EarthArXiv. Although there are plenty of unanswered questions, this first-order estimation of what happened between May and mid-November matches up with the calculations of those geoscientists that took to social media. In fact, the volume of magma involved is so huge that this is certainly one of the largest offshore volcanic events offshore to be spotted by modern scientific instrumentation.
There is a major caveat to all this, however. Compared to land-based monitoring, theres a huge lack of offshore monitoring happening around the world today, and there are likely plenty of offshore events that have taken place since modern records began that scientists havent picked up on.
Make no mistake, though: The recent event offshore from Mayotte, which is still ongoing, is colossal. 
According to the data from the onshore GPS stations, as well as the seismic signalsincluding the weird November 11 eventthe rumbling is definitely being generated by volcanic activity of some sort. The way the ground on Mayotte is moving implies that the seafloor off its eastern shoreline is sinking at a rate of around 0.4 inches per month. At the same time, Mayotte itself is shifting eastward at a rate of 6.3 inches per month. Both indicate something huge underground is on the move, causing some serious deflation.
The nature of these tremors suggest that the magmatic source is centered at a depth of 16 miles beneath the seafloor. In the first six months of the sequence alone, at least 0.24 cubic miles of magma has shifted around. Thats roughly equivalent to 385 Great Pyramids of Giza.
Helen Robinson, a geothermal expert and PhD candidate at Glasgow University, compared it to volumes of other submarine eruptions. From the 1998 Axial Seamount eruption offshore from Oregon, to the Havre paroxysm north of New Zealand on the Kermadec arc, it certainly seems this is the largest submarine event in terms of volume on record, she told Gizmodo. 
Samuel Mitchell, an expert in underwater eruptions at the University of Hawaii at Mnoa, and who worked on the Havre eruption, agreed that the amounts of volcanic material involved are definitely comparable. The 2018 event at Mayotte does appear to show a substantial volume of magma leaving a deep storage region which, if erupted, would make this indeed one of the largest recent submarine eruptions documented, he said. 
Thats a big if, though. As Robinson also points out, and as the new pre-print paper acknowledges, whats happening near Mayotte is not necessarily an eruption.
Pierre Briole, a geophysicist at Frances Ecole Normale Supérieure and one of the authors of the pre-print, told Gizmodo that the indirect evidence means that hes pretty sure its an eruption. But as there is currently no direct evidence of an eruption having taken place, there is a significant probability that no lava reached the surface.
That the low-frequency rumble spread across the world was probably due to a perfect storm.
Failing to breach into the sea, the migrating magma might have injected itself into thick sediments in the seafloor and spread itself around. Mitchell explained that this has been observed elsewhere, when the magma is denser than the surrounding sediment. 
Although the overall volume of magma involved is comparable to the 2012 Havre eruption, the two are likely to be quite different events. The former definitely involved plenty of eruptive material, whose huge pumice raft was first spotted from a plane. At the same time, large, gloopy volcanic domes formed on the seafloor. 
In Mayottes case, if an eruption did take place, Mitchell explained, its more likely to be some sort of fissure effusion involving more fluid lava, a bit like an underwater version of what happened on the slopes of Hawaiis Klauea in 2018.
Jean Paul Ampuero, a seismologist and director of research at Frances Research Institute for Development, told Gizmodo that this whole sequence is record-breaking in many aspects. Along with the huge volume of magma, the November 11 signal was also easily one of the largest low-frequency tremors of its kind.
That the low-frequency rumble spread across the world was probably due to a perfect storm, according to Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton.
In this case, that meant having both a very large source and vibrations at the exact right pitch to carry them across a considerable distance.
The November 11 signals individual elements still remain deeply puzzling. In particular, its repeated high-frequency bursts, which are similar (but arent related to) industrial activity, are difficult to explain. Ampuero said that they fall into a timing pattern that indicates they are strongly connected to the low-frequency pulses, indicating the two components are talking to each other in some way.
One highly speculative explanation is that the high-frequency events are related to the collapse of the rocky walls surrounding the magmatic monster. This disturbs the magma reservoir, causing it to oscillate or hum. At the same time, waves bouncing back and forth hit other flanks and trigger more collapses, generating more high-frequency events. This all happens, Ampuero suggests, in a way that causes the low- and high-frequency events to synchronize, forming the November 11 signal.
Its very difficult to say for sure. Some smaller tremors in the sequence also had a similar signal, Ampuero added, so perhaps theyll catch another one like the big tremor and take it apart to see what its made of.
Theres another element to the story thats currently unexplained: the emergence of lots of dead fish offshore from Mayotte. 
The geological setting is also pretty weird. This major volcanic event is taking place on the eastern end of the island chain, whereas the youngest volcanic islands are to the west. So it appears to be happening in the wrong place.
Its also unclear whats responsible for the volcanism in the first place. It could be caused by action along a tectonic plate boundary, an upwelling plume of superheated mantle material, or even an extension of the East African Rift, a major tectonic event thats slowly tearing the continent apart, said Hicks.
There is even an ecological element to the story thats currently unexplained: the emergence of lots of dead fish offshore from Mayotte. Volcanic gases can suffocate sea life during eruptions, but the pre-print reports that the gases remained trapped in the magma.
Briole has heard unverified reports that the fish that died were deep-sea fish. The magmatic activity might have scared them up to the surface, where they experienced low pressures that they couldnt survive in. Robinson said that the magma, which may have intruded into seafloor sediments, cooked those sediments and released carbon dioxide into the water column, which could also have asphyxiated those deep-sea fish.
Like much about the event, this remains speculative for now. Clearly more instrumentation is required, and the French National Centre for Scientific Researchwith help from the BRGM and other authoritiesare now deploying plenty. This includes equipment on Mayotte, at the site of the activity, and on the Glorioso Islands to the east, so that they can listen to the disturbances from the other side.
That still wont solve all the enigmas. Mitchell pointed out that underwater drones and ship-based radar surveys will be required to determine how much lava erupted at the surface, if any, and Hicks suggested that numerical simulations and laboratory work may be required to better comprehend whats going on beneath the surface. 
As Ampuero emphasizes, this isnt just about scratching a scientific itch, but helping out the local communities, too. The people in Mayotte really want to know whats going to happen next, he said. As a recent report on the situation notes, there is often an atmosphere of confusion and distrust on the island. The more research thats conducted, the better off everyone will be.","On November 11, 2018, a deep rumble ricocheted around the world, one that humans couldn’t feel but that registered quite clearly on seismometers.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright PA Fracking is controversial, this much we know. But the government has ratcheted-up tensions with plans that could see shale gas projects fast-tracked in future. Those tensions were particularly apparent this week at a packed out parliamentary debate. Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP MPs lined up to lambast the proposals and call for a rethink. So what's causing all the consternation? Well, one idea that the government's recently consulted on is whether non-hydraulic shale gas exploration projects should be granted planning permission through ""permitted development rights"". For anyone who's built a kitchen extension or conservatory, it may be a familiar phrase. Permitted developments, in the government's own words, provide a ""simpler, more certain route to encourage development"". Crucially, that removes the need to put in a planning application to the local council although the relevant licenses and environmental permits would still have to be obtained. Image copyright Reuters Leading this week's Westminster Hall debate, the Conservative MP for Fylde, Mark Menzies, said that the idea was ""nothing short of irresponsible and downright bonkers"". He described some of the infrastructure and traffic that can surround shale gas sites and asked, ""Who on earth thinks that is equivalent to building a little extension on the side of your bungalow?"" Fracking was halted again this week at Lancashire's Preston New Road site after a 1.1 magnitude tremor. Shale gas firm Cuadrilla said the tremor was no cause for concern. It's also worth pointing out that the current hydraulic operations there would not have fallen under the government's proposed permitted development scheme. But the incident has provided fuel for critics of the government's fracking policy. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Cuadrilla's Preston Road fracking site Hydraulic fracturing is a technique used to extract gas or oil by injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals, at high pressure, into the earth via drilled boreholes. The water mixture opens up cracks in the rock and the sand lodges into the spaces to keep them open, allowing for the release of gas. The government's proposals, for permitted development, would only apply to non-hydraulic shale gas exploration. This works without the use of fluid pressure but allows companies to drill for core samples. However, many argue that even exploration sites can cause considerable disruption to local communities. Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron described the government's proposals as a ""subversion"" of local democracy. ""Permitted development was created for conservatories, small extensions and outhouses none of which to the best of my knowledge have ever created an earth tremor,"" he said in the debate. Ministers have also consulted on the planning process for fracking sites should they reach the actual hydraulic production stage. The government is looking at whether such applications could be included in something known as the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects regime or NSIPs. Think major new roads, railway lines and airports. NSIPs typically see a Planning Inspector present a report and recommendations to the relevant Secretary of State. Local councils get to ""inform"" the decision, but they certainly don't get to make it. Given the government's much-trumpeted commitment to ""localism"", the irony has not been lost on Conservative MPs. Image copyright Reuters East Yorkshire's Sir Greg Knight said: ""If the government is being consistent, shouldn't local communities have more say on fracking matters and not have their voice taken away?"" He was one of 10 Tory MPs to express concerns at this week's debate and there are more. Misgivings range from cautious scepticism to outright anger. North East Derbyshire is a marginal seat where a company recently won permission, through appeal, to look for shale gas. The constituency's Conservative MP, Lee Rowley, has described the government's proposals as ""ludicrous"", adding that, ""fracking in my view will not work in this country"". Ministers point to the fact that permitted development rights do contain exclusions and restrictions that can mitigate a development's impact. They also say that NSIPs do see local communities consulted at an early stage while councils can submit written representations during the examination process. But there has been a hint this week, perhaps, of some political nervousness. On the back of two consultations, that many argued amounted to undermining local democracy, a third consultation has appeared all about ""strengthening community engagement""; specifically whether it should be compulsory for shale gas firms to consult communities at the pre-application stage. Planning Minister Kit Malthouse this week told MPs: ""We believe this could further strengthen the role local people play in the process."" But it's led to claims that the government is now ""all over the place"" on its fracking policy. Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron said: ""This is the most inconsistent, confusing thing that I've seen in all my 35 years in parliament."" The government's determination to explore the potential of fracking is based on the hope that it could deliver greater energy security, jobs and cheaper gas for consumers. There is also some considerable frustration at the sluggish, yet fraught, way in which shale gas applications can currently be processed at a local authority level. Energy minister Claire Perry has previously said it is ""a morass of protest and counter-prevailing information and frankly I pity any local councillor that gets an application on their desk because they will shortly have a travelling circus of protestors most of whom do not hail from the areas where those sites are located."" Ministers do insist that they remain fully committed to ensuring that local communities are properly involved in any application whilst also ensuring that the process is sped up. However, when it comes to controversial shale gas schemes, there is a real question over whether those two aims can easily be reconciled. And also whether the government can contain the evident displeasure and disquiet amongst some of its own MPs.",Plans to speed up the planning process to boost fracking are not going down well with some Tory MPs.,2018-11-02T13:52:48Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Government urged to ditch 'bonkers' fracking plan,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46071985,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6C92/production/_104149772_93c7eda8-af7f-489d-a641-d563b89080b6.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tremor,1
Travis Fedschun,"Residents in the San Francisco Bay Area are living along a fault that is a ""ticking time bomb"" that could generate an earthquake that could kill hundreds, according to a report released Wednesday. The U.S. Geological Survey said in a report called the "" HayWired Scenario "" that a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on Hayward Fault located under Oakland could kill as many as 800 people and injure up to 18,000. “This fault is what we sort of call a tectonic time bomb,” USGS earthquake geologist emeritus David Schwartz told the Los Angeles Times. “It’s just waiting to go off.” Researches said the Hayward Fault is dangerous because it runs through ""one of the most urbanized"" areas in the nation, stretching along the East Bay from Richmond and Berkeley up north, through Oakland, and spanning south toward Fremont.

(USGS) The USGS, citing findings from a simulated tremor with an epicenter in Oakland modeled to take place at 4:18 p.m. on April 18, said the disaster would cause 400 fires that could destroy 50,000 homes. Nearly half a million people would be displaced, authorities said. Researchers said East Bay residents could be without water from anywhere between six weeks to six months, according to the report. Electricity could be out for up to four weeks in some locations.

Cory Doctorow,"A new study in Applied and Environmental Microbiology ( Sci-Hub mirror ) conducted microbial surveys of the bathrooms at the University of Connecticut (where the study's lead authors are based) to investigate whether hand-dryers were sucking in potentially infectious microbes and then spraying them all over everything, as had been observed in earlier studies. They were. The full cycle goes like this: when you flush a toilet that doesn't have a lid, the turbulence of the flush sends fecal particles into the air, where they hover in a miasmic cloud; when the dryers switch on, they pull these particles in through their intake, heat them up, and spray them onto your moist hands and other moist, hospitable surfaces where their bacteria can thrive. HEPA filters greatly reduce this mechanism. The new study specifically focuses on lower-powered hand-dryers, which some people had believed were less prone to sucking in tiny pieces of shit and spraying them on you. Earlier studies on hand-dryers were tainted by funding from companies that manufactured paper towels, but as far as I can tell, no such conflict exists here. PS533 “was almost certainly dispersed throughout bathrooms in the research areas as spores, which would easily survive desiccation in room air, as well as the elevated temperatures in hand dryer air; however, growing or stationary-phase bacteria would not be nearly so hardy as spores,” the authors note. “However, the facile dispersion of one bacterial strain throughout a research facility should probably be a concern to risk assessors and risk managers when dispersion of potentially pathogenic bacteria is considered.” In a final test, the researchers did a cursory look at some of the other bacteria the dryers were blowing around. They found that with or without a HEPA filter, the blowers stirred up potential pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus. The findings should be a wake-up call to managers of research and clinical settings. The authors note that Clostridium difficile—a devastating and intractable diarrheal plague—also forms spores, and researchers have found that a flushing toilet can easily launch it into the air. “This suggests another means of C. difficile transmission and one that may not be interrupted by either hand washing or traditional surface decontamination methods,” the authors conclude. “The role of this potential mode of C. difficile transmission is worthy of future study.” Deposition of Bacteria and Bacterial Spores by Bathroom Hot-Air Hand Dryers [Luz del Carmen Huesca-Espitia, Jaber Aslanzadeh, Richard Feinn, Gabrielle Joseph, Thomas S.

Cory Baldwin,"We've partnered with California cheese maker Cypress Grove to highlight creative ways to incorporate one of our favorite ingredientsgoat cheese!into your holiday party spread. Not to brag, but Ive put together my fair share of ridiculously abundant cheese plates through the years. (Id like to thank the one-two punch of formerly working at a fancy cheese counter andshockerreally liking cheese.) Lets just say, if you come over my house for dinner, rest assured there will be cheese. Actually, in years past, it probably would have been more accurate to say: Rest assured there will be so much cheese youll be Thanksgiving-full before I even serve you the salad course. In my dairy-loving zeal, I could never choose between a barnyard stinker and a salty marbled blue; an ice-cream-like triple cream and a runny-meets-crumbly cave-aged goat; a nutty, crystallized aged gouda or a grassy clothbound cheddar. So Id just get them all! (Easy solution, right?) But in all honesty, as much as I love sampling a bit of this and a bit of that, all of that cheese on one board can be as overwhelming for the palate as it is for the plate. So Ive learned to reel it in: Instead of trying to hit every single flavor and texture note on the cheese spectrum for every dinner party (which can multiply pretty quickly), now I pick just one hero cheese that I know everyone will love. Then I build out the board from there with crackers, seasonal fruit, and a few extra doodads like homemade jam or compote, infused honey, or candied nuts that will all work well with the cheese, no matter how you mix and match the components for each bite. The end result is a win-win. Its easier and cheaper, for starters. And with all those extras, youll definitely still strike all of the salty/nutty/crunchy/spicy/sweet notes. Plus, my cheese boards actually taste better because I can be a little more thoughtful about how everything interacts. For bigger parties, Ill pick three cheeses instead of just one, but Ill still build out three separate boards, making sure to spread them around the room. (That way my friends dont all hover over one table, fighting each other for the spreader...another curse of the overcrowded cheese board!) Below are a few of my all-time favorite combos, but you can apply the same principle to any of your favorite cheeses: Photo by Rocky Luten The cheese If you havent tried this one, Im willing to bet youve admired it at the cheese counter. With a cakey white center, ring of cream around the rind (which gets runny and unctuous at room temperature when this cheese is ripe), and a line of ash straight through the middle, Humboldt Fog has a super distinctive look you'll probably recognize. According to the artisans that make the cheese at Cypress Grove, it was inspired by the line of fog that hovers over the coastline in Humboldt County, California, where the cheese is made. (Perhaps the self-taught founder's time in France, home to classic cheeses like Morbierwhere the morning milk and evening milk were traditionally separated with a layer of vegetable ashhad something to do with it, too.) The extras Fresh figs Savory wet nuts Cerignola olives Crackers with raisins, walnuts, rosemary Dried apricots Why it works Creamy and tangy, this cheese works with all sorts of stuff. Figs (which are also great with Midnight Moon below, by the way) and bright, buttery olives are a good place to start; dried apricots keep the colorful theme going. Because it's a relatively mild cheese, a cracker with a lot going onlike raisins, nuts, and/or herbsis a nice match. To top it all off, I love pairing Humboldt Fog with a homemade, savory take on wet nuts, which is a classic ice cream parlor topping usually made with honey or maple syrup and walnuts. Because, you know, this cheese is so lush it might as well be ice cream. Photo by Rocky Luten The cheese This cheese is plenty truffle-y without being too in-your-face pungent; in other words, its truffled cheese for people who think they dont like truffles (and also people who already know they love them!). Soft-ripened, the buttery, almost whipped texture of this cheese really serves as a nice canvas for all that flavor. Leave the cheese out at room temperature for at least one hour before serving, and more time if you can. As the cheese softens, the truffle aromas loosen up and the texture only gets more velvety. The extras Peppadews Cornichons with lots of pearl onions Thick-cut, plain potato chips Salmon roe Buttery crackers Why it works You want big flavors that stand up to that tangy, truffle-y goodness, but you dont want a shouting match. Anything super salty or briny is an awesome complement, instead of a competitor; when picking out the extras, think about what you might want inside or alongside a martini (and honestly, a martini would be a pretty good match here too). My dream bite is a thick-cut, salty potato chip topped with Truffle Tremor and pearls of salmon roe, chased by a super-briny cornichon or sweet-spicy peppadew. Photo by Rocky Luten The cheese A six-month aged goat Gouda, this was one of my favorite cheeses to sample out when I worked behind a cheese counter; its so darn likable that every time I asked someone to try it, theyd end up purchasing a big hunk. Thats because its a bit of a revelationespecially if youve never had aged goat cheese before. Similar to classic Goudas, its got a nutty flavor and those lovely, crunchy protein crystals that come from the aging process, plus a unique, goaty tang thats all its own. The extras Fig jam or caramelized onion jam Endive spears Apple and pear slices Prosciutto Oat crackers Why it works Midnight Moon plays well with a lot of other flavors, so you cant really go wrong here. Thats why I like to throw a few different things on the plate so you can mix and match. In the fall, apple and pear slices make a sweet, fresh combo with the cheese. (Have you ever had apples with cheddar or gouda? Its that idea, and it totally works here). I also like to offer a sweet something with a bit more complexity, such as a fig or caramelized onion jam, to play up the sweet-and-salty thing. Prosciutto makes an easy addition since it echoes a lot of the flavorsnutty, salty, umamiin Midnight Moon itself. Endive spears add a nice pop of color, fresh crunch, and a bitter counterpart, while toothsome oat crackers are a good match for everything on the table. If you still wind up somehow overdoing it (I often do) with your three hero cheese plates, dont worry, you can find uses for all of these cheeses long after youve cleaned up the party. Midnight Moon is amazing grated and mixed in to anything melted, like a macaroni and cheese situation, or tossed with winter greens for a warm salad; Humboldt Fog is fantastic crumbled into salads or flaked on top of savory crepes; I recommend eating Truffle Tremor with roasted potatoes...or simply with a spoon. When Mary Keehn first started making goat cheese, she had just two goats (Esmeralda and Hazel) and no experience. But after perfecting a fresh goat cheese over her stovetop, which quickly caught on in her Humboldt County, California community, she launched Cypress Grove Chevre in 1983. Today, Cypress Grove has over 1,000 goats and produces a variety of award-winning goat cheeses, like Midnight Moon, Truffle Tremor, and its most popular, Humboldt Fog. In partnership with Cypress Grove, we're excited to share unique ways to bring goat cheese to your holiday table this season, from dips and spreads to fancied-up cheese boards.","We've partnered with California cheese maker Cypress Grove to highlight creative ways to incorporate one of our favorite ingredients—goat cheese!—into your holiday party spread.

(REUTERS/Stringer) Philippines’ most active volcano spewed lava that cascaded down-slope and emitted ash that fell on nearby towns, state volcanologists said on Tuesday, prompting the provincial government to shut more schools. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) recorded nine episodes of tremor, four of which accompanied lava fountains, and 75 lava collapse events as pressure builds up leading to lava flows and ash plumes, reiterating its warning that a hazardous eruption could happen any time. Mount Mayon, a volcano in the coconut-growing central Bicol region that draws tourists because of its near-perfect cone shape, has shown increased restiveness since Saturday, displacing thousands of residents. Phivolcs said the advancing lava and pyroclastic flows had reached the six-kilometre radius no-go zone, from which some residents fled. “Alert level 3 remains in effect over Mayon Volcano, which means that it is currently in a relatively high level of unrest as magma is at the crater and hazardous eruption is possible within weeks or even days,” it said. Alert level 4 means an eruption is possible “within days” while level 5 is when a hazardous eruption is under way. The Albay provincial government has expanded its class suspension order to include more towns around the 2,462-metre (8,077-foot) volcano, and advised travellers to avoid ashfall-hit villages amid poor road visibility. Class suspensions have allowed the government to use schools as temporary shelters for displaced people.

It was detected on Saturday after drilling for shale gas resumed in Lancashire following a 0.8 tremor on Friday. Neither was felt at surface. Since 15 October, Little Plumpton has been the first UK shale fracking site after the process was halted in 2011 when it was linked with earthquakes. Fracking firm Cuadrilla said it aimed to resume operations on Monday. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique to extract gas and oil from the earth Liquid is pumped underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil within Applications have also been submitted by various firms in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and for a second site in Lancashire The Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy says shale gas ""has the potential to be a new domestic energy source"" Governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have said they will oppose fracking until further research is completed into its environmental impact The process restarted on Saturday morning after a 0.8 magnitude tremor on Friday, which is categorised as a ""red"" event by the monitoring system regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority. Saturday's tremor was detected at the firm's site in Little Plumpton after work ended for the day on Saturday, when operations finish at 13:00. Any tremor measuring 0.5 or above means fracking must be temporarily stopped while tests are carried out. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fracking has drawn strong opposition, including from activist and designer Vivienne Westwood (centre) A Cuadrilla spokeswoman said that, as the operations had finished before the detection, ""This is not an 'red' incident under the traffic light system operated by the Oil and Gas Authority as we were not pumping fracturing fluid as part of our hydraulic fracturing operations at the time. ""However we will, as always, continue to monitor the seismic activity closely and plan to resume hydraulic fracturing on Monday 29 October."" She said all relevant regulators had been informed. A spokesman for the the Oil and Gas Authority said: ""While the operations at the Preston New Road site have been designed to minimise any disturbance, minor events like these were expected."" He added: ""Provided that the event is in line with the agreed Hydraulic Fracture Plan and the risk of induced seismicity continues to be appropriately managed, then operations may resume on Monday."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fracking started near Preston New Road on 15 October Fracking resumed earlier this week after it was paused as a precaution following a 0.4 tremor on Tuesday. On Friday, a Cuadrilla spokesman said: ""Micro seismic events such as these result in tiny movements that are way below anything that would be felt at surface, much less cause any harm or damage."" The firm's chief executive Francis Egan added: ""It is an extraordinarily conservative figure, far below the 2.5 in Europe or 4 in Canada."" Mr Egan said he expected more incidents to be recorded because of the sensitivity of the recording equipment used by the company. Fracking resumed in October for the first time since 2011 after campaigners failed to stop the process with an injunction bid. A spokesman for Frack Free Lancashire said ""more fossil fuels had no place in a modern-day energy strategy"". Test drilling was suspended after two tremors in the nearby Fylde Coast - one of 2.3 magnitude and the other of 1.5 - in April and May 2011 respectively. A study found it was ""highly probable"" the test drilling for shale gas caused the tremors. A government-appointed panel recommended greater monitoring and said operators should observe a ""traffic light"" regime, with tremors of 0.5 or above triggering a ""red light"" and an immediate halt. Cuadrilla said earlier this month it would spend at least three months fracking two horizontal wells and then test to see if the gas flow was commercially viable.",BBC News Fracking in Lancashire: Second 0.8 tremor in 24 hours BBC News A second tremor of 0.8 magnitude has been recorded within 24 hours at the UK's only active site for fracking.

Gargi Verma,"Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray greets Rajendra Gavit after he joined the party in Mumbai on Tuesday. PTI
THE TRIBAL-DOMINATED Palghar district has been symbolic of the political tribulations and ever changing alliances which Maharashtra has been witnessing in the run-up to the polls. Leaders who were once at loggerheads are now being forced to break bread together, as BJP and Shiv Sena have decided to smoke the peace pipe. At the other end, the CPI(M), which speaks about the rights of tribals in the area, has thrown its lot behind the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi a front floated by the Thakur brothers, who have often been accused of terrorising locals and land grabbing.
In a strange political twist, the Sena has been forced to loan itself a candidate from the BJP in the form of sitting MP Rajendra Gavit, after it reaslied that its initial choice of a party candidate may not be a safe bet. The Palghar seat fell vacant last year following the death of sitting BJP MP Chintaman Wanga. In the bypoll, the BJP and Sena, though allies in Maharashtra and at the Centre, fought against each other. The BJP had fielded Gavit, while the Sena gave ticket to Chintaman Wangas son Srinivas Wanga, who lost.
In the past seven to eight months, I have worked hard for the people. It was for a short tenure, but people in the area want me to be elected again. The CM told me that every seat is important for Narendra Modi and hence, I have decided to join Sena, said Gavit, who on Tuesday joined Shiv Sena, which nominated him from Palghar. While Srinivas Wanga was rumoured to be getting the Sena ticket, the party decided to give him a ticket during the Assembly elections to be held later this year. Wanga claimed that he wasnt ready for the Lok Sabha elections. The party has taken a decision upon my suggestion. I welcome it. Whatever future plans the party has, I am happy to go along, he said.
The constituency, fairly nascent, is a culmination of six areas, each with its unique set of problems. While Dahanu and Vikramgadh are rural and mostly tribal areas, Nallasopara and Vasai are urban cities bursting at their seams. Adding to it, the bullet train and several other development projects pass from the area. While in some places, the voting would be done by urban dwellers worried about losing their houses, in the rural hinterland, there are no houses to leave and no party distinctions either. Here, people follow names and banners. Their votes are for whoevers name or banner was more visible to them, said Vinayak Mhatre, an activist who works in Dahanu.
The Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, backed by CPI(M), has a strong hold in the urban areas with CPI(M) lending the rural support. The party, helmed by Hitendra Thakur, is a strong contender to both BJP and Sena, as seen in the past in the Vasai Virar Municipal elections. We will declare the candidate by next month. It will be a mutually decided candidate, Kshitij Thakur from Bahujan Vikas Aghadi said.
Vasai, Virar and Nallasopara are sister cities with similar issues. The illegal construction, lack of facilities for the ever increasing populace, and the flooding caused by both natural and man-made factors are the dominating concerns. The bullet train is also a sore point for farmers and landowners who worry that they will make way to the transition camps after they give up their land.
While the parties have made headway with their outreach programme, they have a host of unique issues to tackle. Not only are the tribals worried about their land rights and being thrown out of their homes, the recent discovery of an active fault line leaves them asking if they want their homes or not. The villagers, who had never thought of leaving their land, are now open to the idea of moving. They want better future for their children, one in which they can at least sleep in their own homes, Anant Ghoda, a social worker from Dhundalwadi said.
The bullet train has emerged as the hot topic, one which counts against the saffron alliance. We have already lost our land once. If voting for someone stops the bullet train project, we will do it, said Nishant Salve, a resident of Hanuman Nagar area in Palghar, from where the bullet train is expected to pass through.
Abject poverty, joblessness and poor health conditions still stand tall. Mokhada and Jawhar were hailed as the epicentre of malnutrition in Palghar. While the conditions have improved, the picture is still bleak. Moreover, Dahanu town in Palghar has been hit by 30 low-intensity earthquakes since November last year, leading to more than 10,000 residents of 40 villages moving out of their homes into tents erected by the district administration and NDRF.
An issue that ties all the six areas in Palghar is water. While the entire state goes through water shortages in summer, water shortage is acute in these areas. We have managed to get water to many areas. When I come back, we will put more plans into action. Not only in the rural areas but also towards the illegal constructions in the urban areas, Gavit said.","The constituency, fairly nascent, is a culmination of six areas, each with its unique set of problems.

D. Parvaz,"In the wake of the failed Hanoi summit that was initially billed as the venue for certain progress in the process to denuclearize North Korea, things seemed to have regressed.
The Korean Meteorological Administration registered a 2.1-magnitude tremor on Thursday at around noon local time. The earthquake is believed to be an “artificial” one, caused by some kind of explosion in a mine North Korea.
It could be that the explosion was just part of ordinary mining activity rather than being caused by any kind of nuclear activity, although previous nuclear tests have caused similar earthquakes.
These developments follow reports indicating that there is renewed activity at the formerly dormant Sohae long-range missile launch site in Tongchang-ri, signaling that authorities are rebuilding rather than dismantling the site. Their activities, analysts feel, are consistent with preparation for another test launch.
South Korean lawmakers were briefed by the country’s National Intelligence Service, with analysts surmising that the site was once again operational.
The site was one that North Korea had vowed to dismantle, as of January, but it seems that rebuilding started before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met with President Donald Trump in Hanoi on February 17 and 18.
President Trump said on Wednesday that he would be “very, very disappointed” in Kim if the reports on Sohae were true.
The only tangible takeaway the president had from his second summit with Kim was a guarantee that there would be no more test launches. Now, even that flimsy promise seems to be in question.
The State Department seems to have no idea why any of this is happening.
A State Department official told reporters on Thursday that the reason for these developments is known only to the North Koreans, adding, “we don’t know why they are taking these steps. They need to keep their commitments to the president of the United States.”
Kim sought some sanctions relief in exchange for the dismantling of a test site and the cessation of missile testing, but was rebuffed by the Trump administration, which claimed Pyongyang had asked for all sanctions to be lifted. The North Koreans openly disputed this version of the events.
In the aftermath of the talks, the Trump administration sought to place the blame for the failure to work out a deal on anyone but the president himself (including the North Koreans, the Democrats, and even the president’s former attorney, Michael Cohen). North Korean State media has placed the blame squarely on the United States.
“The public at home and abroad that had hoped for success and good results from the second [North Korea]-US summit in Hanoi are feeling regretful, blaming the US for the summit that ended unexpectedly without an agreement,” read the KCNA report.
The first summit between the Kim and Trump, held in Singapore in June, yielded little more than a vague commitment to Pyongyang’s denuclearization, without defining what that really means to each party or attaching any timelines or steps in the process.","In the wake of the failed Hanoi summit that was initially billed as the venue for certain progress in the process to denuclearize North Korea, things seemed to have regressed.

Jodi Brak,"Update 11:30 a.m. March 3:
According to an expert in geoscience, the earthquake which caused a stir in the Shuswap on Saturday, March 2 is not likely to result in aftershocks.
Taimi Mulder, an Earthquake Seismologist working for the Geological Survey of Canada which is a part of Natural Resources Canada, said aftershocks are not generally observed following a quake of this size.
“You can never rule anything out, Mother Nature has her own rules,” Mulder said.
According to Mulder, the earthquake was detected by multiple monitoring stations, the nearest of which was in Lillooet. She said the station in Penticton out of operation for maintenance.

Mudler, based at the Pacific Geoscience Centre in Sidney B.C., said the Juan De Fuca Plate, located off the west coast of Southern B.C. and the Northwestern United states, is slowly subducting or sliding beneath the North American Plate. She said the subduction creates stress in the North American Plate and small inland earthquakes sometimes result as the plate readjusts itself.
According to Shuswap Emergency Program spokesperson Tracy Hughes the emergency program was monitoring the situation after the tremor was fel on March 2.
“Members of the Salmon Arm fire department investigated, but there were no reports of damage or injuries. This meant there was no need for us to launch any further activation of emergency services,” Hughes said.
Mulder said although Saturday night’s earthquake was not powerful enough to cause damage it is a good opportunity to review preparedness for natural disasters. In a serious earthquake people should seek shelter beneath a piece of furniture and hold on tight. Other precautions people can take include securing large shelving units to walls, storing heavy objects on bottom shelves and avoiding placing heavy wall hangings above beds.
Update 7:40 a.m. March 3:
According to Earthquakes Canada, on of their monitoring stations detected an earthquake four kilometres Northeast of Salmon Arm at 8:39 p.m. Saturday night.
The monitoring equipment picked up a 2.2 magnitude earthquake originating a kilometre below the earth’s surface. According to Earthquakes Canada’s website, no damage was reported and none would be expected from a quake of this size.
Original Story:
At approximately 8:45 p.m. on March 2, something shook homes from Sicamous to Tappen and alarmed residents, though no confirmation has yet to come in as to what exactly happened.
Initial conversations on the scanner said an explosion was reported at 16 Avenue NE in Salmon Arm; fire and ambulance crews responded but found nothing at the scene. Social media indicated multiple calls were made to RCMP, who reported nothing conclusive, and CP Rail dispatchers were reported contacting train crews to see if anything could be reported.
Dispatchers updated over the scanner at approximately 8:15 p.m. updating that ground shaking was felt in many areas.
At approximately 10 p.m., Shuswap Emergency Program stated there have been widespread reports of the explosion but nothing has yet been found.
“Officials are still investigating the situation, but at this time, 9:50 p.m. on Saturday, March 2, there has been nothing found. Currently, our emergency management has not been activated. We will report back as soon as we know more information,” states the SEP Facebook page.
SEP also says Sicamous Fire Department is reporting no indication of any unusual activity or emergency within their boundaries.

While social media conversations suggested a small earthquake may have occurred, the Seismogram in Lillooet reported no activity at the time of the shake.
The suggested cause of the event that shook homes in the area are various on social media, from a sonic boom resulting from a low-flying jet plane to a possible meteor. A post in the Vernon Rant and Rave Facebook page reports seeing a large shooting star or possible meteor at the approximate time the shaking was felt.
As of yet, none of this has been confirmed by authorities however, and no injuries or property damage has been reported.

The 6.3-magnitude quake, centred in East Lombok, struck at a relatively shallow depth of seven kilometres (four miles) and was felt across the island, officials said. It was the third major quake in less than a month to rock the island, after deadly tremors on July 29 and August 5 and numerous aftershocks. ""The earthquake caused people to panic and flee their houses,"" national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told Metro TV. ""There have been no reports of death or (serious) damage but people are traumatised.""

Alex Kierstein,"There's no denying that Ford's EcoBoost 3.5-liter V6 engine is a powerhouse. In the F-150 Raptor, it produces a remarkable 450 horsepower and 510 pound-feet of torque. However, in the regular F-150, the 3.5L is limited to 375 hp. Make that ""was."" The Raptor's up-rated engine is making its way into the luxurious F-150 Limited, and you might be thinking that to preserve the Raptor's roost at the top of the Ford pickup pecking order, they'd saddle it with a lower power output. Nope. The 2019 F-150 Limited gets the same rated output as its brawny off-road cousin. The move makes the F-150 Limited so equipped the most powerful 1500-class pickup on the market, upstaging the various full-size trucks from GM offered with the 6.2-liter V8, which pumps out 420 hp. This turns the regular 3.5L EcoBoost's power deficit into an up-rated motor's horsepower boon. What's telling about the truck market in general is that this option didn't appear on a sport truck intended for the street — the revival of the old SVT Lightning that some truck enthusiasts have been pining for. Remember the Tremor ? That single-cab pickup with a 3.5-liter EcoBoost was an interesting idea but a lackluster execution, and didn't capture the Lightning's pizazz. That history aside, in another era this might have been a muscle truck. But the market's insatiable demand for pickups with high-end content makes the Limited the natural spot to plop the top-dog engine. Plus, the Raptor is quick enough on the street to occupy some of the Lightning's old slot in the lineup. Instead, the F-150 Limited will do battle with the upscale GM trucks, like the GMC Sierra Denali. Inside, there's a new two-tone leather option, but other Limited trappings seem unchanged. Well, if you don't consider enlarged leather perforations to be significant. Pricing for the 3.5L EcoBoost option has not been announced, but the truck will be available late this year.

"USA TODAY, Kelly Lawler, USA TODAY","It's cold out there. Stay in and turn to these shows coming to your TV this winter. USA TODAY Matt Czuchry and Manish Dayal in 'The Resident.' (Photo: Guy D'Alema/Fox) Dr. Conrad Hawkins (Matt Czuchry), The Resident of Fox's new medical drama, doesn't play by the rules. He's foul-mouthed, obnoxious, has no respect for authority but he gets results. We've seen him before. And we've seen him on much better shows. Resident (Sunday, 10 ET/7 PT, then Mondays at 9 ET/PT starting Jan. 22, ★ ½ out of four) is an exercise in frustration. Self-important, predictable and inconsistent, the series delivers bland stories about terrible people playing God, just because they can. The series follows Conrad as he shows his new intern, Devon (Manish Dayal), his particular brand of doctoring, which is revered by his co-workers, including Nic (Emily VanCamp) — a nurse and his former lover — and Mina (Shaunette Renée Wilson), a brusque surgical resident. The only staff member who resists Conrad's charms and his personal moral code is chief of surgery Randolph Bell (Bruce Greenwood), who regularly kills patients in surgical accidents due to a tremor, and regularly covers it up. Manish Dayal, Emily VanCamp, Matt Czuchry and Bruce Greenwood in 'The Resident. (Photo: Guy D'Alema/Fox) Although there's improvement in its second episode, the biggest problem with the irritating series is that it wants you to love Conrad and his resistance to the corruption in the modern health care system, but it also makes him loathsome. There are moments when he's all smiles and standing up for the little guy, but others when he's incurably reprehensible, as when he tries to pull the plug on a brain-dead patient before the family has consented. When he pivots from good guy to jerk, the episodes crater. The supporting characters do little to help. Dr. Bell is the obvious villain, but he is only slightly more odious than the rest. Devon is entitled in his own way, encouraged by Conrad to be the worst version of himself. Mina is unfeeling to the point she flippantly tells a patient's family of his death as if announcing the time. And although Nic is ostensibly the show's moral center, she sides with Conrad more often than not. Shaunette Rene Wilson and Emily VanCamp in 'The Resident.' (Photo: Guy D'Alema/Fox) It's a shame, because it's a waste of the talents of Czuchry and VanCamp ( Revenge ), two usually appealing TV veterans. In fact, Czuchry has made the entitled jerk type work wonders on better-written shows like Gilmore Girls and The Good Wife. That he can't make Conrad sympathetic is telling. An angry, self-centered, anti-heroic doctor has anchored good medical series before (hello, Gregory House), but Resident doesn't have the inherent charm required to propel it. It also arrives in a season in which the biggest breakout hit is ABC's The Good Doctor, a show that's so feel-good it borders on saccharine, but its earnest tone works for it. Like Conrad, Resident is trying to be too clever for its own good.

AFP,"By: AFP | Seoul | Updated: November 15, 2017 4:17 pm Debris from a collapsed wall is scattered in front of a shop after an earthquake in Pohang, South Korea. (Source: AP) A rare 5.4-magnitude earthquake hit South Korea’s southeast today, the second most powerful quake on record in a country that seldom experiences significant tremors. The quake, felt across much of the country including in the capital Seoul, struck at the shallow depth of nine kilometres (six miles) near the industrial city of Pohang at around 2:30 pm (05:30 GMT), the Korea Meteorological Administration said. Seven people were injured, Seoul’s public administration ministry said, but they warned that number could rise because the quake was shallow. The Korean peninsula rarely has to worry about significant quakes. But seismic activity is closely monitored because a spike in activity is often the first indication that North Korea has carried out a nuclear test. The port city of Pohang is home to the headquarters of Posco – the country’s top, and the world’s fourth largest, steelmaker. No immediate damage was reported in the firm’s steel mills. Photos and video footage sent to local TV stations showed crumbled street walls, furniture violently shaking inside people’s homes and people rushing out of buildings in panic. Shattered storefronts and goods tumbling off store shelves were seen in images posted on social media, as well as cars smashed by fallen bricks and cracks in the ground. Emergency centres nationwide were flooded with thousands of calls seeking information, while Kakao Talk – the South’s top mobile messenger application – reported service disruption due to heavy traffic. South Korean President Moon Jae-In, on his way to Seoul after attending the ASEAN summit in Manila, is set to hold an emergency meeting upon arrival, his office said. Today’s quake was followed by multiple aftershocks including a 4.3-magnitude tremor that hit about two hours later. It came a day ahead of the all-important college entrance exam during which the whole nation falls silent to help teenagers focus on the annual event, whose result could define their future in the competitive society. As many fear more quakes that may take place on the crucial day, Prime Minister Lee Nak-Yeon ordered officials to deploy “all government resources possibly available” to ensure that Thursday’s test is held smoothly. Even Seoul’s financial markets and many businesses open late on the day to clear traffic for test-takers, with airport landing and takeoffs suspended for 30 minutes during the main language listening test. Local nuclear reactors were operating without disruption, Yonhap news agency said, citing officials at Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power. The most powerful quake recorded in the South was a 5.8-magnitude tremor that hit the southeastern city of Gyeongju in September last year.

In response, INDECI started sending humanitarian aid like tents and blankets to the affected areas. Heavy machinery was also on its way to clear roads and remove rubble. Sunday's earthquake was also felt in the northern parts of Chile. ONEMI, Chile's National Emergency offices, said on its website that no injuries or damage had been reported.

,"Rescue teams search for victims in the rubble in North Lombok AP Photo/Tatan Syuflana By New Scientist staff and Press Association Rescuers still have not reached some devastated parts of the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok after a powerful earthquake flattened houses and toppled bridges. At least 91 people were killed and neighbouring Bali was shaken in the tremor with the death toll is expected to rise. It was the second deadly quake in a week to hit Lombok. A quake on July 29 killed 16 people and damaged hundreds of houses, some of which collapsed in Sunday evening’s magnitude 7.0 temblor, killing those inside. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that damage was “massive” in northern Lombok. In several districts, more than half of homes were destroyed or severely damaged. Some areas still had not been reached, with rescuers battling against collapsed bridges, electricity blackouts and damaged roads blocked with debris. Lack of heavy equipment was hampering attempts to find victims beneath the rubble of a mosque that collapsed in northern Lombok while villagers prayed inside, Mr Nugroho said. The death toll had risen to 91 and will “definitely increase”, he said, adding that two of the deaths were in Bali and the rest in Lombok. More than 200 people were seriously injured. Thousands of homes and buildings were damaged and 20,000 people are in temporary shelters. The quake, measured at magnitude 7.0 by Indonesian authorities and a still-powerful 6.9 by the U.S. Geological Survey, struck early on Sunday evening at a fairly shallow depth of six miles in the northern part of Lombok. On Gili Trawangan, one of three popular vacation islands near Lombok, thousands of tourists and locals spent the night on a hill fearing a tsunami.",Rescuers still have not reached some devastated parts of the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok after a powerful earthquake flattened houses and toppled bridges,2018-08-06T17:38:00Z,"{'id': 'new-scientist', 'name': 'New Scientist'}",More than 90 people killed in massive earthquake on island of Lombok,https://www.newscientist.com/article/2176139-more-than-90-people-killed-in-massive-earthquake-on-island-of-lombok/,https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/06173751/18966757-1.jpg,new-scientist,New Scientist,tremor,1
Reuters,"By: Reuters | Hawaii | Updated: May 5, 2018 7:27:54 am County workers deliver cots and blankets to an evacuation center in Pahoa available to residents of the Puna communities of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens who were forced to leave their homes after the Kilauea Volcano erupted on Thursday. (Reuters) GA series of fresh earthquakes on Friday, including a powerful magnitude 6.9, hit Hawaii’s Big Island, where the Kilauea volcano has been spewing fountains of lava into residential areas and forcing hundreds to evacuate. The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the strongest tremor at 12:32 p.m. (2332 GMT) measured 6.9, a magnitude capable of causing severe damage. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake, whose epicentre was on the south flank of the volcano, was not large enough to cause a tsunami although it generated sea level changes around the island of up 15.7 inches (40 cm). It caused buildings to shake at the Community Center in Pahoa town, one of two evacuation centers in the area hastily set up after lava started burbling up through fissures in the ground in neighborhoods nearby. A new fissure opened up just before the latest tremor on Friday in one of those neighborhoods, Leilani Estates, about a dozen miles (19 km) from the volcano, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said in a text message, making a total of four found so far. Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes and one of five on the island, has been in constant eruption for 35 years. Lava flows from the volcano have covered 48 square miles (125 square km), according to the US Geological Survey. Scientists say it is nearly impossible to predict how long an eruption will last. On Thursday, Kilauea began spewing lava into residential areas after a series of earthquakes over the past week, the USGS reported on its website. Starting around 11 a.m. on Friday, the island experienced a flurry of earthquakes, culminating in the massive magnitude 6.9 tremor. Residents in Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions, home to about 1,700 people, were ordered to evacuate in the early hours of Friday after public works officials reported steam and lava erupting from fissures in the road, the Civil Defense agency said. No injuries or deaths were reported, but Hawaii Governor David Ige activated the Hawaii National Guard to provide emergency help. PART OF LIFE Keone Kalawe, 58, a native Hawaiian who was volunteering at an evacuation center in Pahoa, shrugged off the latest quake as “just part of life over here.” His family was forced out of the village of Kapoho, about 6 miles (9.7 km) from Pahoa, after an eruption in 1960, and he’s witnessed other eruptions over the past three decades. So he has lived with lava, which is not dangerous, he says. “I tell people,’You just have to sidestep.'” A fissure on Leilani and Kaupili Streets in the Leilani Estates subdivision caused by an eruption of the Kilauea Volcano is shown following a series of earthquakes, in Hawaii on Friday. (Reuters) A 492-foot-long (150-meter) fissure ripped open a road and spewed lava for about two hours in Leilani Estates at about 5:30 p.m., the Hawaii Volcano Observatory said on its website. Dale Miller, 58, a resident of Leilani Estates, said police knocked on his door at 4 a.m. and ordered an evacuation. “There are lava tubes on our property,” he said referring to the natural tunnels underground that drain lava during an eruption. “The whole thing is Swiss cheese. “It felt like there was something under the house -– like a big snake was moving under the house,” said Lee Begaye, 61, Miller’s partner and housemate. Lee added this was the first time in eight years of living by the volcano that they’d had to evacuate. HIGH SULPHUR LEVELS Civil defense officials have warned the public about high levels of sulfur dioxide near the volcano, one reason for the evacuation orders. The gas can cause skin irritations and breathing difficulties. Keala Noel, 64, also from Leilani Estates, said she didn’t feel the lava was directly threatening them, but came to the shelter at 3 a.m. on Friday because of the sulphur. “We stayed because we didn’t feel any imminent danger. But I could hardly breathe yesterday.” One resident, Ikaika Marzo, told Hawaii News Now he saw “fountains” of lava as high as 125 feet (38 meters). Lava, which can reach temperatures of about 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit (1,150 Celsius), spread less than about 10 meters (33 feet) from the fissure, the observatory said. Betty Long, 72, another Leilani Estates resident, evacuated to the shelter near Pahoa in the early hours of Friday morning, but her husband stayed behind with their pets because he was afraid of looters. “I think my husband is like a lot of residents there” who are assuming looting is going to be a problem. “That’s why they are reluctant to leave,” she said. Long said that while their retirement home is a gorgeous place to live, it comes with risks. She and her husband faced a choice between purchasing hurricane or volcano insurance. They chose the hurricane insurance, she said.

Arun Janardhanan,"Leaders close to Dinakaran said he would not topple the government but try to “capture” it “like Palaniswami did to Panneerselvam” early this year. Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal IN A state that has witnessed intense political turmoil over the last year, the immediate impact of the victory of rebel AIADMK leader T T V Dinakaran in the R K Nagar Assembly bypoll, in the seat vacated by the late J Jayalalithaa, would be felt at three levels, say senior politicians and analysts in Tamil Nadu. According to them, Sunday’s win will result in confusion among party cadre and top leaders about who is heading the real party in the eyes of voters. It will raise questions about the “true inheritor” of Jayalalithaa’s legacy, a year after her death. And, it will lead to turbulence in the unified AIADMK faction led by Chief Minister E K Palaniswamy and Deputy CM O Pannerselvam. Speaking to The Indian Express, a senior AIADMK minister revealed that he sent his aides to meet Dinakaran’s close supporters and express support hours as soon as Sunday’s result was declared. “The rebel camp will definitely gain more strength. Many MLAs of the ruling faction have already spoken to Dinakaran. We do not want this government to fall. But if that is the fate that awaits us when the Assembly session begins in January, we will join Dinakaran, retain the government and make him the Chief Minister… Unknowingly, the people of R K Nagar may just have elected a chief-ministerial candidate,” said the Minister, speaking on condition of anonymity. Leaders close to Dinakaran said he would not topple the government but try to “capture” it “like Palaniswami did to Panneerselvam ” early this year. “What is going to be crucial is the fate of the case of the 19 disqualified MLAs supporting Dinakaran, which is expected to come up before the Madras High Court on January 9. The Assembly session next month will also give a chance to the DMK to raise the issue of a minority government,” said a leader in the Dinakaran camp. The win has also brought hope to the Opposition DMK camp, even though its candidate in R K Nagar lost his deposit. “If there is one more floor test, as we expect, this government will fall and we will face polls in the next six or seven months,” said a senior MLA of DMK. “The DMK will definitely move a no-confidence motion. If the verdict in the case of the 19 MLAs favours Dinakaran, he may try to avoid an election as that will favour DMK. But we hope that the BJP will respond to Dinakaran’s victory with a hammer as usual and facilitate elections,” he said. Multiple sources in the AIADMK ruling faction indicated that a large section of its MLAs and ministers may join Dinakaran if such a situation emerges. “Except for a few top leaders, including Palaniswami, Panneerselvam and ministers such as Jayakumar and Pandiarajan, a large section of the top leadership is in touch with the Dinakaran camp or the Sasikala family,” said sources. The DMK, meanwhile, views the result as an “emergency call” to “introspect… strategies”. “Maybe, for the people of R K Nagar, it was not an election between the DMK and the AIADMK but a question of who is the real AIADMK. We consider this as an emergency call for DMK at the right time to introspect on our strategies,” a DMK leader said. Another DMK leader said, “Our candidate could not match the image that Dinakaran built over the last six months.” Asked about perception that the bypoll result has confirmed Dinakaran as the inheritor of Jayalalithaa’s legacy, P Ramajayam, political analyst, Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy, Trichy, said, “The verdict has actually revealed that the AIADMK has no legacy to match MGR or Jayalalithaa. Dinakaran’s money power and micro-management at the ground level, with hundreds of supporters from other districts working in R K Nagar for the last three weeks, and the DMK’s miscalculation were all factors that gave him a huge victory and the DMK an embarrassing defeat,” he said.

Stephen Deusner,"For years I’ve been toying with two metaphors for Olivia Tremor Control’s beguiling, befuddling, bewildering album, Black Foliage: Animation Music Vol. 1. First, a garden: Its mix of brightly melodic, supremely catchy pop songs and unruly sonic experiments sounds like colorful flowers blooming in a bed overgrown with weeds, dead leaves, spider webs, suspicious mushrooms, a menagerie of creepy-crawlies, black foliage. It’s fitting and evocative, but perhaps too tidy. Listening closer on the eve of the album’s 20th anniversary, I find as much beauty in the weeds as in the blossoms. Those odd interstitials, mixing musique concrete with drones, distortion, and warped instrumentation, are just as cultivated as the more traditional songs, and there is as much joy to be found in the springy percussion of “Black Foliage (Animation 3)” as in the stacked harmonies and majestic arc of “I Have Been Floated.” What I always mistook for rot is actually its opposite.
My second metaphor: a dream. You can see an enormous set of eyes on the wall in front of you, or you might converse in depth with a figure made of jelly, and you only question the logic of such happenings when you wake up — that is, if you remember anything at all in the morning. In the dream, you accept such goings-on as perfectly normal; even if you don’t understand the logic, you understand the lack of logic as a king of logic. Black Foliage seemingly rejects the traditional logic of pop music for something much harder to grasp. Gone are verses and choruses, bridges and solos. There are no pauses between these 27 tracks, no fadeouts and fadeins (except, of course, on the four-sided vinyl edition). Everything melts together; there is always music in the air. 
This idea persisted long after I’d given up on the whole garden thing, mainly because there’s a lot to back it up. In the liner notes for Olivia Tremor Control’s 1996 album, Music From The Unrealized Film Script: Dusk At Cubist Castle, the band asked fans to send in recordings of themselves describing their dreams. The results ended up on “Combinations 2″ and “Hilltop Procession (Momentum Gaining),” albeit heavily excerpted, distorted, chopped, and screwed. Moreover, the lyrics suggest you are in a dream state while you’re listening: “Things come rushing in, things come rushing out,” goes “A Sleepy Company,” “when you’re in a dream.” 
Have we woken from that dream yet? Two decades after the album made Olivia Tremor Control one of the most popular bands out of Athens, Georgia, Black Foliage remains reluctant to relinquish its mysteries. It sounds every bit as strange and as slippery and as dreamlike as ever, although that whole dream idea suggests a group of musicians defaulting on their artistic decisions, leaving things up to happenstance and exerting no control over the music. I’m reluctant to deny artists credit for their labor, for the hard work that goes into devising a particular sound and then realizing it in the studio, which means there must be a set of rules governing these tracks. The fact that we’re still figuring them out doesn’t mean they’re not there. It just means that this strange and singular album continues to dispel easy interpretations and simple metaphors. 
Black Foliage is unlike any other album, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t without context. Olivia Tremor Control were a flagship Elephant 6 band, with roots that extend well beyond the Athens city limits. It starts in Ruston, Louisiana, population: a few thousand people, where Will Cullen Hart, Bill Doss, Robert Schneider, and Jeff Mangum met and started playing around with four-track recorders, exchanging weird-ass recordings. As adults they migrated to Denver and finally to Athens, Georgia, along the way establishing Elephant 6 as a loose, grassroots thingamabob: part record label, part philosophical collective, like Dogme 95 but with musical instruments and people you’d want to talk to at parties. Eventually this musical amoeba migrated to Georgia, where the quartet continued making weird music and eventually released a handful of 7″ singles at a time when releasing vinyl was almost unheard of. Membership was liquid, with musicians popping when needed and available. Schneider and Mangum focused more on Apples In Stereo and Neutral Milk Hotel, respectively, so the band cohered around Hart and Doss as its guides.
Their love of ’60s pop wasn’t exactly unusual in the waning days of the 20th century. In the mid 1990s the early internet made trading bootlegs much easier, and one of the most popular was Smile, the notorious lost album by the Beach Boys. Groups like the High Llamas, the Divine Comedy, Cardinal (and Eric Matthews solo), and even Belle &amp; Sebastian were exploring the lush harmonies of ’60s pop, delving deeper than the Beatles and the Stones to find some sounds and ideas that jostled against the prevailing alt-rock rules of the era. Elephant 6 was the Southern nexus for this loose movement, and all of the bands under that umbrella tinkered with those influences. But few did as much with them as Olivia Tremor Control, who re-situated ’60s pop so that the familiar suddenly sounded fresh and fantastical. 
Black Foliage thrives on the contrast between rigidly constructed pop music and loosely structured experiments, between logic and intuition. Pop is controlled; noise is uncontrolled. Rather than a simple binary, however, the contrast between these two musical poles creates a static/signal ratio that is always shifting, even right now. I forget how focused and succinct the 23-second “Opening” is. It melts into “A Peculiar Noise Called ‘Train Detector,'” the first “pop” tune on the album and one that introduces many of the ideas the musicians will be exploring. But that song is just as noisy, just as unhinged as any of the musique concrète interstitials that follow. That only difference is the din is given shape by the vocal melodies. There is, ultimately, no distinction between “music” and “noise.” There is only sound. 
Joyous sound, it should be noted. Even at its darkest, there is still a bubbly kind of optimism coursing through Black Foliage, as Hart and Doss sing about endless permutations of best selves, a slipperiness of identity that is empowering rather than obscuring. Perhaps the most focused set of lyrics on this album, “The Sylvan Screen” opens with someone at their window, watching the cars pass by on the street below. “No one sees me looking at them from my window, and I can be any one of them I wanna be.” The music imitates the back and forth of traffic, each instrument passing into and then out of the song: the creaking floorboards, the lo-fi guitar strum, the disembodied saxophone, the ectoplasmic banjo, the barely corporeal electric guitar. The song sounds like it might veer off in any direction or indulge any tangent at any moment, but the band manage to keep it on track, a feat that becomes increasingly impressive the deeper into the song they get. 
Failed metaphors aside, what I’ve decided is that Black Foliage is something much more basic and much more complicated. It is a celebration of sound, an explication of the metaphysics of music, a treatise on the pleasures of hearing. A party, perhaps. “Above the clouds and below the bark they’re having parties,” they sing on closer “Hilltop Procession (Momentum Gaining).” In fact, it sounds like they’ve invited the entire population of Athens to sing along. “Beyond those roots find a treehouse symphony there.” Black Foliage is Olivia Tremor Control’s earnest invitation for all who hear these notes to join the revelry.","For years I've been toying with two metaphors for Olivia Tremor Control's beguiling, befuddling, bewildering album, Black Foliage: Animation Music Vol. 1.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The 2011 Tohoku earthquake was initially estimated to be 7.9 magnitude Researchers have developed a new approach to estimate the true size of very large earthquakes. At present, scientists use seismic waves from a rupture to work out the scale of the event. But a new analysis of the Tohoku earthquake in Japan in 2011 shows that changes in gravity can give more rapid information. This method could have accurately estimated that magnitude 9 tremor in minutes, not the hours actually taken. As Japan's largest recorded earthquake, the Tohoku event is probably best remembered for the huge tsunami it unleashed. As well as killing around 12,000 people it triggered the meltdown of three nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The 330-tonne trawler Kyotomaru was swept 500 metres inland by the tsunami in 2011 Experts believe that the quake was caused by the rupture of a stretch of the subduction zone associated with the Japan Trench, which separates the Eurasian Plate from the downward-sliding Pacific Plate. Initial estimates of magnitude by Japan's meteorological agency indicated it was a 7.9 tremor. Three hours later, this was corrected to 8.8. Eventually the Tohoku quake was upgraded to 9.1 magnitude. These estimates are based on seismic waves generated by the earthquake which travel through the Earth and are recorded on seismometers all over the world. Scientists look for what are termed P-waves as the fastest way to deduce what is happening in an event. These travel at around 7-8km per second. However, French researchers have been looking at the possibility of using small shifts in gravity to estimate scale. Large tremors can cause perturbations in the Earth's gravitational field - and as these signals travel at the speed of light, they open up the possibility of much more rapid detection of quake magnitude. Up to now, gravitational signals have been difficult to detect above the seismic noise, but the French research team developed their model to analyse the Tohoku event using data recorded with broadband seismometers located some 1,000 to 2,000km from the quake. ""As soon as you have the location and origin time of the earthquake, you know when the seismic waves will arrive at good quality stations inland,"" said lead author Dr Martin Vallée, from the Paris Institute of Earth Physics. Image copyright USGS Image caption A map showing the intensity of shaking due to the 2011 quake ""And if you look to see a gravity signal before the arrival time of the seismic waves, if you can see this, it really means you have a large event. If you cannot see it you will be in a magnitude 8.5 or below."" According to the authors, this method of analysis would have reliably detected that the Tohoku quake was greater than magnitude 9 within three minutes of the origin time. This could have had major implications especially for the tsunami that followed it. ""Knowing that a quake is very large a few minutes after is not very useful for the areas that are directly affected because the seismic waves will already have affected the area,"" said Dr Vallée. ""But it is for the tsunamis which often arrive half an hour after an earthquake, they are much slower than the seismic waves, and here you have some time to react. It is very useful."" At present, the research team say that the ideal places to test the method are in locations that have had an earthquake greater than magnitude 9 in recent centuries, such as the Cascadia region of the US and Canada. Looking ahead, the scientists believe that with refinement, their method of analysing gravity signals could allow more rapid detection of the size of smaller events. ""It will be really important if in the future we have instruments that can measure the signal and are more sensitive,"" said Dr Vallée. ""We will be able to apply the same analysis to smaller earthquakes, and when I say smaller I mean magnitude 7 or 8 which in fact are very large and can destroy a lot."" The study has been published in the journal, Science. Image copyright Getty Images by Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent It's not possible to predict earthquakes but it is possible to issue alerts once a major event is under way. And for those not living directly above the point of rupture, but some distance away, such warnings can give people vital seconds to prepare. These systems - they have them in places like Japan and Mexico - work on the basis of detecting the different arrival times of seismic waves. So-called P-waves are less destructive vibrations that run ahead of the far stronger and more damaging S-waves. But neither move as swiftly as the changes that become apparent in the gravity field once a quake has moved a great mass of rock inside the Earth. If you could practically harness this signal in an early warning system then it could provide just a few seconds more grace for the surgeon to lift their scalpel away from a patient's organ or for the driver of a packed commuter train to slow down. However the gravity signal is very subtle and it will be challenging to make use of it in all but the very largest events. On average there is only about one ""great quake"" of magnitude 8 or higher a year. But there is hope the technologies can be improved. This new research came out of discussions surrounding the detection of gravitational waves from black hole mergers in space. That technique had its doubters for a long while but eventually proved its worth. Even if a gravity signal cannot be woven into an early warning system, just knowing the true scale of a quake much faster will be important information for first responders.",Researchers develop a new speedy approach to estimate the true size of very large earthquakes.,2017-12-01T17:21:20Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Gravity signals rapidly show true size of giant quakes,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42183077,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8F3E/production/_99007663_hi011517900.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tremor,1
Scott Scrivens,"Google's latest flagships are here, and as with the previous two generations, the headline feature is the camera. Yet more computational magic has made its way into the camera on the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, including something called Super Res Zoom. It's practically the 'enhance' feature we've all been waiting for, but how does it work? Pixel 2 v Pixel 3 at 7x zoom. Ryan touched on this in his Pixel 3 review — he was pleasantly surprised by the results, even if they aren't quite as good as with optical zoom — and now a post on the Google AI Blog goes deeper into the mechanics of the feature. Previous attempts to better digital zoom have often rested on guessing missing details in a single cropped image, but Google's new method is a little more complex. Digital photographs already use a process called demosaicing to fill in some blanks — as much as two thirds in some images — but digital zoom relies on this so much that the results end up not being so great. What Google does differently relies on something it already has good experience with: burst photography. It's used for the Pixel's best-in-class HDR+ algorithm, where it takes multiple sequential images and combines them to produce a better dynamic range. Multiple images can be combined to fill in details. With Super Res Zoom, what's important is that the burst images taken of a scene are from slightly varying positions. Natural hand tremor is usually enough to get shots that grab different details, but if your hands are too steady, the lens on the Pixel 3 camera will actually wiggle a bit to mimic this. With several images, even with just a pixel of movement in each one, the Google Camera app can use data from each to compose a photo with far greater detail than digital zoom has been able to achieve previously. There are plenty of additional challenges involved in this process, which you can read about in Google's exhaustive blog post. It says that the results are roughly equivalent to photos taken using the 2x optical zoom lens on competing smartphones and it seems to be a pretty accurate claim, which is no mean feat.","Google's latest flagships are here, and as with the previous two generations, the headline feature is the camera.

"Christina Bonnington, Christina Bonnington","As Amazon Echo Dot owner Gavin Hightower was heading to bed the other week, he encountered a disturbing Alexa bug. For no apparent reason, the device uttered a “very loud and creepy laugh.” “There’s a good chance I’m getting murdered tonight,” Hightower tweeted after the incident. Hightower isn’t alone: Numerous Echo device owners have reported their Alexas laughing spontaneously, unprovoked by their wake word (“Alexa”) or any other command. For other users, it’s more than just laughter. Some report their Alexa devices failing to fulfill their spoken requests, performing random other actions instead, and then capping it off with a guffaw. Of all the bugs your smart assistant could encounter, uttering a high-pitched “ witch-like ” laugh ranks among the creepiest possibilities. (Other podium contenders: Saying “I’m watching you” or actually making a threat.) The issue has now evolved into a trending moment on Twitter, and Amazon has responded to the phenomenon, telling the Verge on Wednesday that the company is “aware of this and working to fix it.” The whole scenario reminds me of Mat Honan’s delightfully dystopian view of the future of connected homes for Wired in mid-2014: I wake up at four to some old-timey dubstep spewing from my pillows. The lights are flashing. My alarm clock is blasting Skrillex or Deadmau5 or something, I don’t know. I never listened to dubstep, and in fact the entire genre is on my banned list. You see, my house has a virus again. Honan’s four-year-old imagined future seems eerily on point. However, at the time, Amazon had not yet launched its revolutionary Echo ; it and other digital assistants are now poised to permeate every facet of our existence. While they’ve had a remarkably good run, it was inevitable that our digital assistants would crack. Friday delivered a tremor of foreshadowing: Amazon’s virtual assistant briefly “ lost her voice ” due to issues with Amazon Web Services. (It’s unclear if these reported issues are related to that downtime.) Whatever the reason for the laughter—and hopefully Amazon will tell us whether this is some sort of software malfunction, a hack, or the work of a disgruntled software programmer—this isn’t going to be a one-off scenario. Amazon is adding capabilities to its assistant on a near-daily basis and so are its competitors, like Google Home. As it gets more bloated with code, the possibility a strange bug could slip through also increases. Consider Apple’s iOS. In November, a strange bug cropped up that autocorrected the letter “I” on iOS devices. Over the years, the operating system has suffered from numerous other bugs: The alarm clock not working, apps becoming unresponsive, and the phone crashing when it encounters a certain character. However, while these bugs can be annoying, inconvenient, or both, they’ve typically never verged on creepy. There’s something different about a virtual entity imbued with personality going haywire, particularly one that’s become a part of the household. In the future, it’s not far-fetched to think Alexa may sometimes have mix-ups when responding to queries or commands, be unable to reach certain services when they go down, refuse commands from a specific voice, or decide it’s time to speak, even though she hasn’t been spoken to. Then there’s the possibility of hacking. Researchers in China last year discovered that it was possible to control a virtual assistant using ultra-high frequencies inaudible to humans but detectable via smart speakers’ microphones. Meanwhile, a U.K. researcher found a way to hack Amazon Echo devices which, while it likely wouldn’t transform your assistant into a laughing demon, could surreptitiously transform it into a spy-style listening device. While both of these situations require direct access to someone’s Echo—which makes the potential for hacking much lower—it still shows that the devices are susceptible to foul play, and that could lead to even creepier Alexa scenarios. The tech savvy could have predicted some of those risks, or the hacking of Wi-Fi–connected devices like baby monitors and thermostats. But a smart home assistant laughing of its own accord for no reason? This is a technological fail that only Hollywood could have imagined, and unfortunately, it’s only the beginning.","As Amazon Echo Dot owner Gavin Hightower was heading to bed the other week, he encountered a disturbing Alexa bug.

newsfeedback@fool.com (Todd Campbell),"In a bid to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of marijuana as medicine, Tilray ( NASDAQ:TLRY ) has secured U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency approval to import capsules containing marijuana cannabinoids for a clinical trial in California. The study will evaluate marijuana's efficacy and safety in patients with essential tremors, a movement disorder that affects between 4.6% and 6.3% of seniors. Read on to learn why Tilray's study is important to investors. What's essential tremor? Essential tremor is a neurological disorder that's characterized by involuntary and rhythmic shaking, usually of the hands, head, or voice. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Typically, essential tremor progresses gradually, beginning on one side of a person's body. The tremors usually worsen with movement (a key difference between it and Parkinson's), and symptoms can be aggravated by things like stress and diet. About half of essential tremor patients can be tracked to a specific genetic mutation. However, the exact gene responsible remains a mystery. The condition is increasingly common with age, and most cases are diagnosed in patients over 40 years old. It isn't a life-threatening disease, but essential tremors can negatively affect quality of life. For instance, patients can have difficulty performing basic tasks, such as drinking from a glass without spilling or writing, and some patients can have difficulty speaking. Investigating marijuana's benefit In collaboration with the International Essential Tremor Foundation, Tilray will help fund the University of California San Diego Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research study of marijuana's effectiveness in essential tremor patients. On Tuesday, the DEA granted Tilray a green light to import capsules from Canada containing the marijuana cannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol, which is responsible for marijuana's euphoric effect, and cannabidiol, the second most common cannabinoid found in cannabis, for use in the study. If successful, the study, which is expected to begin in 2019, will inform the design of future studies that could provide essential tremor patients with an important new treatment option. Currently, a variety of medications are used to help treat patient symptoms, including beta blockers, anti-seizure medications, tranquilizers, and Allergan 's ( NYSE:AGN ) blockbuster, Botox, which is most widely known for its use in cosmetic procedures. However, beta blockers are mainly used to treat high blood pressure, and they don't control tremors in everyone. Anti-seizure medications, which are used to treat epilepsy, usually offer only a temporary benefit, and tranquilizers can help people if their tremors are worsened by anxiety, but they're habit-forming. Botox can be effective for controlling head tremors, but it can cause weakness in fingers when used to treat hand tremors. An expanding focus Tilray's essential tremor study is an example of how the company plans to differentiate itself from competitors by demonstrating how its products, including cannabinoid oils, capsules, and edibles, improve patient health. The company already works with pharmaceutical distributors in a dozen countries to advance marijuana research, and in addition to enjoying sales growth because of Canada's expanding medical marijuana market, it's beginning to reap benefits from participating in Germany's medical marijuana market. Tilray distributes cannabis extracts to pharmacies in Germany through Noweda, one of the country's biggest drug distributors, and earlier this month, it got the OK to import cannabis flower there, too. It's now the only approved importer of both flower and cannabis oils in Germany. Why it matters The essential tremor study won't have data available for a while, but there are two reasons I think this news is important. First, an eventual success in this indication could be a big win for Tilray. The International Essential Tremor Foundation estimates that 10 million Americans suffer from essential tremor, and that figures likely to increase as aging baby boomers cause the over-65 population to swell. And second, trials like this could position Tilray as the go-to marijuana brand for improving patient health. If so, then Tilray could benefit from winning share in Canada's recreational marketplace when it opens for business next month. Deloitte estimates Canada's adult-use marijuana market could be worth between $1.8 billion and $4.3 billion in Canadian dollars next year, so any efforts that help Tilray's differentiate itself could pay off handsomely for investors.",The company's plans include funding a study of marijuana's use in patients with essential tremors.,2018-09-19T11:32:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fool.com'}",Tilray Pushes Deeper Into Healthcare,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/09/19/tilray-pushes-deeper-into-healthcare.aspx,https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F494791%2Fmarijuana-medical-1-gettyimages-483300738.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize,,Fool.com,tremor,1
Al Jazeera,"At least 11 people have been killed when a magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck close to the northermost tip of Haiti, roughly 20km west-northwest of Port-de-Paix. Government spokesman Eddy Jackson Alexis told AFP news agency seven people were killed in Port-de-Paix, the capital of Haiti's Nord-Ouest department, while four others were killed in the town of Gros-Morne, about 50km to the southeast. The quake, which was felt across the country, struck at 8:10 pm (00:10 GMT Sunday) at a depth of 11.7km. The tremor was one of the strongest to hit Haiti since a 7.0 magnitude quake struck near the Port-au-Prince in 2010, killing tens of thousands of people. In a post on Twitter, President Jovenel Moise, who faced calls for his resignation over the summer due to fuel price hikes, urged people to remain calm after the civil protection agency reported the latest quake had caused outbreaks of panic in northern towns.

Sam Rose,"One of neuroscience’s foundational experiments wasn’t performed in a Nobel laureate’s lab, but occurred in a railyard in 1848 when an accidental explosion sent a tamping iron through 25 year-old Phineas Gage ’s forehead. Gage survived, but those studying his history detailed distinct personality changes resulting from the accident. He went from even-tempered to impulsive and profane. The case is likely the earliest—and most famous—of using a “lesion” to link a damaged brain region to its function. In the ensuing decades, to study the brain was to study lesions. Lesion cases fed most of the era’s knowledge of the brain. One might think that modern neuroscience, with its immense toolkit of experimental techniques, no longer needs lesions like Gage’s to parse the brain’s inner workings. Lesion studies, though, seem to be having a revival. A new method called lesion network mapping is clearing the cobwebs off the lesion study and uniting it with modern brain connectivity data. The results are revealing surprising associations between brain regions and disorders. Thankfully, most lesions aren’t a tamping iron through the forehead. Strokes, hemorrhages, or tumors make up most lesion cases. 19th century neurologists like Paul Broca made foundational discoveries by studying patients with peculiar symptoms resulting from these common neurological insults. Broca and his contemporaries synthesized a theory of the brain from lesions: that the brain is segmented. Different regions control different functions. Lesion studies lend a lawyerly logic to the brain: if region X is destroyed and function Y no longer occurs, then region X must control function Y. This logic, though, is a bit misleading. No single brain region can really control any function. The modern view of the brain is that individual functions rely on a network of interconnected brain regions working in concert. Thus, modern neuroscience views individual lesion cases as imperfect, uncontrolled experiments of nature that don’t necessarily speak to how a network controls a brain function. This point becomes obvious when researchers pool, or meta-analyze, lesion data. When looking at all of the published lesion cases for a given condition—say parkinsonism—researchers see that the lesions that cause this condition don’t occur in just one region. Lesions seemingly all over the brain cause parkinsonism and other conditions. This fact, along with the emergence of elegant experimental tools have pushed lesion studies to the sidelines of neuroscience. Some researchers, though, are attempting to revive the relevance of lesion studies—both for neurology and psychiatry. The authors of a new study published in Brain use the disparate locations of lesions to their advantage—in this case to better understand the neuroanatomy of parkinsonism. Parkinsonism is a grouping of symptoms affecting movement. It consists of slowed movement, rigid musculature, and tremor. The most common cause of these symptoms is Parkinson’s disease, where dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra are progressively lost. Nigral cell loss in Parkinson’s disease occurs through a slow degenerative process that is still poorly understood. But parkinsonism is possible without nigral degeneration, and notably can occur following a sudden lesion like a stroke or hemorrhage. Patients with lesion-induced parkinsonism aren’t diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, exactly, but their slowed movement, rigid musculature and tremor are nearly identical to those with “classical” Parkinson’s disease. The study compiled 29 published cases of lesion-induced parkinsonism. The lesions did not all occur in the same region, and surprisingly most were not in the substantia nigra. The authors hypothesized that the parkinsonism-causing lesions, despite occurring in disparate brain structures, disrupt common connectivity networks in the brain. To test this, the authors overlaid these lesion locations on a map of the brain known as the connectome —a structural map of region to region connectivity derived from functional MRI data. With the lesions applied to the connectome, the authors were able to identify networks—or tracks of connectivity—that the lesions disrupted. Each of the 29 lesions sat within several different networks, which is to be expected as the brain is a rich tangle of connectivity. But the authors saw that 28 out of 29 cases affected networks that connected through a small, sheet-like structure called the claustrum. The claustrum is rarely discussed in the field of movement control or Parkinson’s disease, and is generally understudied. An important aspect of the study is that none of the 29 lesions were to the claustrum, itself. It took the combination of the lesions and the connectome to identify the claustrum as a structure of importance for parkinsonism. The claustrum coincidentally appears as a rest stop, so to speak, on the network maps of almost all the lesion cases. But is this just a coincidence or is it important? To address the claustrum’s importance to parkinsonism, the authors turned to patients with the more common, degenerative form of Parkinson’s disease that had deep brain stimulators implanted in their brain. Deep brain stimulation is a treatment of last resort for Parkinson’s disease and doesn’t yield universal improvement. In most cases, stimulating electrodes are implanted into a region called the subthalamic nucleus. The precise location within the subthalamic nucleus varies patient to patient. The authors examined the precise location of deep brain stimulators within Parkinson’s disease brains and overlaid those locations onto the connectome. They saw that when electrode locations were within networks that flowed through the claustrum—presumably altering claustrum activity—patients saw better results from deep brain stimulation. This result argues that claustrum activity plays a critical role in generating parkinsonian movement. Also, altering that activity provides relief from parkinsonism. 19th century lesion studies were framed by the question, “which region controls which function”. Decades of neuroscience have reframed a more nuanced question, “which regions are important to which functions?” Lesion network mapping empowers lesion studies to rigorously answer this newer question. To patient communities, however, the question has always been “can this finding help us?” In the case of the claustrum and Parkinson’s disease, only time will tell. Targeting treatments—like deep brain stimulation—to the claustrum, though, may be a helpful advance for those with Parkinson’s disease.",A new technique is reviving the century-old study of brain lesions and revealing surprising things about neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2018-10-30T13:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}","Neuroscience Discovers Power of ""Lesion Network Mapping""",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuroscience-discovers-power-of-lesion-network-mapping/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/6BA9D695-88FA-4E6B-90F6C67AAF311BF0.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,tremor,1

At least six have died in Iraq as well. State television said more than 336 people were killed in Iran and at least 3,950 were injured. Local officials said the death toll would rise as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran. The earthquake was felt in several western provinces of Iran, but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah, which announced three days of mourning. More than 236 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in Kermanshah province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border. Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. Rescuers were laboring to find survivors trapped under collapsed buildings. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television. At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected.

Iran's police, the elite Revolutionary Guards and its affiliated Basij militia forces were dispatched to the quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported. Iranian Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said some roads were blocked and authorities were worried about casualties in remote villages. An Iranian oil official said pipelines and refineries in the area remained intact. Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people. Hospital severely damaged On the Iraqi side, the most extensive damage was in the town of Darbandikhan, 75 km east of the city of Sulaimaniyah in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region. More than 30 people were injured in the town, according to Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed. ""The situation there is very critical,"" Rasheed told Reuters. The district's main hospital was severely damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said. In Halabja, local officials said a 12-year-old boy died of an electric shock from a falling electric cable. Iraq's meteorology center advised people to stay away from buildings and not to use elevators in case of aftershocks. Turkey and Israel Google Maps Residents of Turkey's southeastern city of Diyarbakir also reported feeling a strong tremor, but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties there. Turkish Red Crescent Chairman Kerem Kinik told broadcaster NTV that Red Crescent teams in Erbil were preparing to go to the site of the earthquake and that Turkey’s national disaster management agency, AFAD, and National Medical Rescue Teams were also preparing to head into Iraq. AFAD's chairman said the organization was waiting for a reply to its offer for help. In a tweet, Kinik said the Turkish Red Crescent was gathering 3,000 tents and heaters, 10,000 beds and blankets and moving them toward the Iraqi border.

Reuters,"By: Reuters | Sydney | Published: March 7, 2018 2:23 pm A man views a house that collapsed in the strong earthquake. (Photo: AP) A magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck Papua New Guinea’s mountainous Southern Highlands on Wednesday killing at least 18 people, an official said, a week after a larger quake flattened villages and killed at least 55 people. The tremor, shortly after midnight local time, struck just 31 km (19 miles) southwest of the epicentre of last Monday’s magnitude 7.5 quake that has left government and aid agencies scrambling to provide emergency supplies to the remote region. Australia and New Zealand said on Wednesday they would increase aid to Papua New Guinea. Australia will deploy three helicopters this week to deliver aid, while New Zealand will send a second military plane to distribute medical equipment, hygiene kits and tarpaulins. Wednesday’s quake was the most severe of a series of aftershocks that have rattled the resource-rich region, about 600 km (370 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby. William Bando, the administrator of Hela Province, said initial reports put the death toll from the aftershock at 18. “It appears Hides was hardest hit. We haven’t heard about potential casualties there yet, but it is a big village with many people,” he added. Manasseh Makiba, Papua New Guinea’s Vice Minister for Petroleum &amp; Energy who represents parts of Hela Province in parliament, said victims were still being found. “People are still being extracted from mud. People are still being taken to hospitals,” he said. Local media outlets reported the death toll from the original quake had risen to 75, after government officials said previously that 55 people had been killed. A spokeswoman at Papua New Guinea’s National Disaster Centre said on Wednesday that authorities were finalising a final report into the casualties from the first quake. James Komengi, a United Church project officer, speaking from Tari, the capital of quake-affected Hela province, said his church’s assessment and response centre had counted up to 67 deaths in that province alone. Aid efforts are being hampered as rescue workers struggle to reach the highlands area as many roads are either badly damaged or blocked. The International Red Cross warned the situation could deteriorate if heavy rains hit the region. “We are anxious to reach communities while there is a lull in what is usually a season of heavy rain. A big downpour could bring landslides in hillsides already destabilised by the earthquake, cause floods and contaminate water,” said Udaya Regmi, Director the International Red Cross in Papua New Guinea. The Red Cross said its initial assessments indicate that as many as 143,000 people could have been affected, with an estimated 500 people injured and 17,000 people displaced from their homes. Even in more accessible areas of the country, health facilities have been damaged. ExxonMobil, which shut its $19 billion PNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) project after the first quake, said on Wednesday its facilities in Hides, where it runs a gas conditioning plant, were safely shut in. All employees and contractors were safe.

"USA TODAY, Kristin Lam, USA TODAY","One of the top seismologists in the U.S. says residents near Anchorage should expect aftershocks following the 7.0 magnitude quake that struck near that city early Friday. (Nov. 30) AP This image obtained from the US Department of Defense and taken by the US Air National Guard, shows an aerial view of damage to a road in Alaska from a 7.0-magnitude earthquake on Nov. 30. (Photo: HO, AFP/Getty Images) Two days after a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck near Anchorage, Alaska is still shaking. Since Friday's tremor, the strongest to strike The Last Frontier since a 7.9 in the remote Rat Islands in 2014, the U.S. Geological Survey has recorded 166 aftershocks of magnitude 3.0 or higher around Anchorage as of 4:50 p.m. PST Sunday, USGS geophysicist Brad Aagaard told USA TODAY. Earthquakes of 3 or higher are strong enough to be felt. There have been hundreds of smaller disturbances: 1,406 aftershocks of at least magnitude 1.0. The aftershocks will occur less frequently as time goes on, Aagaard said. Over the next week, the USGS has predicted 84 to 610 aftershocks of magnitude 3 or higher. Aftershocks of at least 3 are more than 99 percent likely. There's an 88 percent chance of a magnitude 5 or higher, too. An aftershock stronger or as strong as the initial one is unlikely, however. The probability for an earthquake of magnitude 7 or higher before Dec. 8 is only 3 percent, said the USGS. The location of the earthquake near the subduction interface at a depth of 25 miles beneath the surface raised the threshold for what magnitudes are felt at the surface, Aagaard said. The subduction zone is the place where two lithospheric plates come together, one riding over the other, according to the USGS. ""If this had been a much shallower one, people really would be feeling a lot more aftershocks,"" Aagaard said. ""So that is probably helping to some extent, in terms of people not feeling as many aftershocks, because they are occurring deeper."" USGS starts with generic models to predict aftershocks, Aagaard said, then makes adjustments as they monitor aftershocks on the first day. Its scientists are updating forecasts on a daily basis and making weekly projections, the time range in which they have the most confidence. ""As we get farther into the sequence, then we can have a better fit to our models to be able to see when we expect to get to the background rate,"" Aagaard said. ""That's what we compare against, which is how many earthquakes we have in an area when we haven't had a large earthquake and aftershock."" Meanwhile, delivery of food supplies, fuel and other cargo has not been interrupted, Anchorage officials said at a Sunday news conference. At the Port of Anchorage, through which 90 percent of all goods sold in Alaska come, at least one major cargo company is unloading as normal. Ships are coming in on schedule and the supply lines are not interrupted, said Mayor Ethan Berkowitz.

As crews make repairs to Glenn Highway, employees living north of Anchorage were encouraged to take Monday off or work from home to reduce traffic. Gov. Bill Walker gave state office workers in the Anchorage area Monday off. The magnitude 7.0 quake, maybe remarkably, did not cause widespread damage to structures or collapse buildings.

Rachel Kaser,"WB Interactive Entertainment today revealed the first gameplay footage of Mortal Kombat 11, the latest installment in the venerated fighting game franchise in a splashy reveal event, and Im already dreading the continuation of the story.
In terms of what youd expect from Mortal Kombat reveals, the show delivered. The new game looks incredibly gory and weighty, and the team have added such new features as customizable fighters (a feature you might recognize from its embryonic form in Injustice 2). The team both showed off and teased a motley crew of new and returning characters, including Skarlet, a character who finally seems to have figured out what clothes are.
The deadliest blood mage and Imperial Bodyguard, Skarlet, returns to #MK11! See her in action: https://t.co/ArJITxDowG#MK11Revealpic.twitter.com/3tZOhUGv2j
 Mortal Kombat 11 (@MortalKombat) January 17, 2019
For the record, this is what she looked like in Mortal Kombat 9:
Also, Ronda Rousey is apparently replacing Tricia Helfer in the role of Sonya Blade. This is a great role for her, because I saw Rousey in Fast &amp; Furious 7, and as an actress boy, shes a hell of a fighter.
So, yeah, jolly good and all. Cant wait to play. But oh dear, I hope this game doesnt try its hand at a time travel story in an attempt to erase what happened in the last game. Maybe Im naive, but Im hoping we avoid that tawdry cliche.
Yes I know, its a fighting game, so I shouldnt expect much from the story, yada yada yada. And sure, I dont go into the average video game dust-up expecting a grandiose literary backstory on the level of The Count of Monte Cristo. But, at least as far as MKX goes, Netherrealm Studios devoted a considerable amount of time and effort into the story and I actually kinda liked it.
Quick *SPOILER* warning: For starters, it didnt shy away from the downer ending of MK9, making Liu Kang, Kitana, and other heroes from that game major villains instead. It introduced a new generation of fighters so we werent looking at the same three or four ninjas. Sure, the story was cheesier than a brie pizza inside a fondue pot, but I found it rather charming at the time.
And I appreciate when a franchise at least tries to shake things up. Otherwise, what is Mortal Kombat, besides a succession of progressively more realistic Sub-Zeros and Scorpions spewing more and more syrupy blood at each other?
Nothing can prepare you. Tune-in for an even more exclusive look at #MK11. https://t.co/ArJITxDowG#MK11Revealpic.twitter.com/LAC91AiYNC
 Mortal Kombat 11 (@MortalKombat) January 17, 2019
Now its looking like the game is desperate to undo that story, and I can already tell this time travel stuff is going to be a headache. It was a headache when it was used to reboot the series at the beginning of MK9, and I see no reason for it to be different now.
The reason Im getting a serious timey-wimey vibe from the reveal is primarily the design of the new characters. Tall drink of water Geras (who seems to have the sandman-esque powers of MKXs Tremor, strangely) has a time-freezing ability he uses in his X-ray move. Another new addition is a character named Kronika, named in the prologue trailer as The Keeper of Time. Yeah, if that doesnt sound like a time-traveling villain in an off-brand episode of the Power Rangers, I dont know what does.
The many new characters from MKX are absent from the proceedings. Also, the characters we do see are looking suspiciously young or refreshed considering their circumstances. Liu Kang and Kung Lao look less undead than they were at the end of the last game. Sonya Blade no longer looks old enough to have a 20-year-old daughter (though that could be because Ronda Rousey is only in her 30s, but still). Baraka returns even though he straight-up died in MKX.
The idea that were going to just undo everything that happened in the last game, so we can have yet another story line where Liu Kang is good and the new kid characters are erased just feelscheap. Please please, Mortal Kombat, dont do that just because you think fans only want to see the old characters.
And if you do well dammit, at least make the fatalies extra gruesome.
FATALITY. Thank you to everyone who tuned in for #MK11Reveal! #MK11pic.twitter.com/YTEdg8Jutr

Express News Service,"The seismic activity in Bharuch was among the largest tremors to strike the state in 2018. (Source: Google Maps) An earthquake measuring 3.7 on the Richter scale, with an epicentre near the Sardar Sarovar Dam built on the Narmada dam in Bharuch district of Gujarat was felt on Saturday evening, official sources said. “The earthquake was epicentered 38 kilometers east-south-east of the Narmada dam and was felt at 4.56 pm. It was one of the larger tremors to hit the region around the dam in the recent past,” an official from Institute of Seismological Research (ISR) told The Indian Express. Data from ISR show that the quake happened at a five kilometer depth near a dry river bed close to Panchasim village. Though Kutch and Saurashtra are among the most active seismic zones in the Gujarat, the Sardar Sarovar dam lies near the Narmada rift zone has experienced shocks of the magnitude 5.4 at Bharuch in 1970. According to ISR, the Narmada fault has potential to produce earthquakes of 6.5 magnitude. The seismic activity in Bharuch was among the largest tremors to strike the state in 2018. This year there were at least four earthquakes that were stronger than felt on Saturday. Measuring between 3.8 and 4.8 on the Richter scale, all of them were in the more active Kutch and Saurashtra regions.

What did they find? That they were right about, about most things, but most importantly about race in Admerica. “West’s tweets could expose his vast audience to conservative arguments with which it is largely unfamiliar,” Rafael Mangual wrote in a piece on FoxNews.com. “West may be dismissed as an eccentric—and his newfound rhetoric may or may not prove short-lived—but if even only a few of his many fans reject the victimhood narrative as a result and accept that personal responsibility illuminates the path to excellence, then it will be to the good.” For those watching or reading Fox News that might need a quick primer on who exactly Kanye West is again and why he is so chummy with the president, FoxNews.com put together a nifty retrospective on the pair titled : “Trump and Kanye West’s relationship through the years: From friends to ‘brothers.’” Chance the Rapper’s response to Kanye’s Twitter activity, and presumably the backlash on the left, only upped the giddiness on the right.

Cory Doctorow,"Prior to 1976, the FDA did not regulate medical implants, and so shoddy and even deadly devices proliferated, inserted into Americans' body. When the FDA finally decided to regulate implants, they were reluctant to subject the devices already in the field to regulation -- after all, these were already in peoples' bodies. So they enacted rule 501(k), which grandfathered in any devices in the market, and any devices that were ""substantially similar"" to those devices. This is a loophole that eventually grew to consume the rule. Since 1976, medical implant makers like Johnson and Johnson have worked in a stepwise fashion: in 1977, make a device and argue that it's ""similar"" to a 1976 device. Then in 78, you make another device and argue that it's similar to the device you got approved in 1977. Flash forward to 2018, and practically all medical implants are approved through this process. Releasing the companies from regulatory oversight did not go well. From ""metal on metal"" joints that released deadly cobalt into patients' bloodstreams and dissolved their surrounding tissues into metal-studded slurry to vaginal mesh implants that caused incredible, life-threatening harm and could never be removed ; to ""Essure,"" a permanent female sterilization tool that also causes life-threatening harm, tens of thousands of Americans have been permanently disabled or killed by their medical implants, their lives turned upside-down, subjected to medical bankruptcy, collapsing marriages, even homelessness and loss of their children. But the FDA has not stepped up, and the companies routinely refuse to withdraw their products even when confronted with stories from injured and dying implantees. The FDA even approves devices if they're ""similar"" to devices that had to be withdrawn because they were killing people -- the criteria for approval is similarity to an approved device, even if that approval led to disaster. In a The Bleeding Edge, a 2018 documentary from Kirby Dick ( previously ) and Amy Ziering, we follow the regulators, the patients and the manufacturers as they enact this awful drama. We see how former FDA officials go into industry, and how industry executives end up running the FDA -- Trump's pick for FCC chief is predictably awful -- and how the manufacturers game the system, getting away with literal murder. It's a wrenching, amazing movie. Like Dick's other movies, it's making a difference: less than a week after the film was released, Bayer withdrew its Essure product from the market, despite its staunch assertions that the product was safe for use. It was an important victory, if a small one: Bayer had already withdrawn Essure in every other country in the world, fearing regulatory scrutiny: only in the USA was it possible for this deadly product to be inserted into women's bodies for all these years. The movie is on Netflix. It's amazing. From The Guardian's review : Stephen Tower, an orthopedic doctor profiled in the film, had developed a tremor and was having a hard time thinking when he decided to scrawl all over the walls and ceiling of a hotel room during a medical conference, eventually using soap as ink. Tower, his friends and family knew he was in the throes of mental health crisis, but no one was sure why. So, Tower studied himself until he found the answer in a blood and urine sample: his levels of cobalt, a metal used in rechargeable batteries, were more than a hundred times higher than normal. Tower thought it might be related to his metal-on-metal hip replacement and had it redone. On the operating table, his surgeon found metal sludge seeping from the device before it was removed. Within a month I had an incredible recovery in terms of my psychologic symptoms and ability to think, Tower said. Tower said he would never have believed neurological problems could come from orthopedic devices, if it wasnt for that experience, and now tests the cobalt levels of his patients if they complain of having Parkinsons or dementia-like symptoms. Hundreds of thousands of people in the world may have been exposed to toxic metals from metal on metal hip implants, according to a 2012 joint investigation by the British Medical Journal and BBC Newsnight. If we cant change the laws and we cant convince companies to put moral issues above profits, then all of us really have to be vigilant, said The Bleeding Edges producer, Amy Ziering. My great hope is you watch this film and then you are really, really, really careful and ask a lot of questions and do a lot of research.","Prior to 1976, the FDA did not regulate medical implants, and so shoddy and even deadly devices proliferated, inserted into Americans' body.

Joshua Nevett,"Last week a series of 10 mini-earthquakes struck Monterey County in the US state, raising fears a monster tremor could devastate the region. A powerful, 4.6 magnitude quake 13 miles northeast of Gonzales, along the San Andreas Fault, was the largest to strike the region. The San Andreas Fault – a 750-mile fissure that runs the length of California – is thought to be long overdue a “Big One” earthquake measuring magnitude 7 or greater. Since last week, a whopping 134 earthquakes within three miles of that 4.6 tremor were recorded, USGS said. GETTY/EARTHQUAKE TRACK HIGH ALERT: Experts believe a magnitude 7 earthquake is 'inevitable' in California Of those earthquakes, only 17 were stronger than a 2.5 magnitude and six greater than 3.0, USGS said. Ole Kaven, a USGS seismologist, said he expects more aftershocks in the coming weeks. “This one has been a quite productive aftershock sequence,” said Kaven. “We suspect there will be aftershocks in the 2 to 3 [magnitude] range for at least a few more weeks.” He said smaller earthquakes could rattle the region for even longer. Related Articles USGS RATTLED: California was rock by a magnitude 4.6 earthquake last week “This one has been a quite productive aftershock sequence.” Ole Kaven, a USGS seismologist There were no reports of injuries or significant damage as a result of the earthquake swarm. Yet, a 4.6 tremor is at the ""higher end of what we expect in terms of magnitude"" for that area, Kaven said. In the short term, this swarm has dramatically increased the chances of a colossal earthquake rattling the region, according to experts. Scientists believe the US state is long overdue a magnitude 7 or greater earthquake by around 50 years. Over the past 150 years, pressure has been building up along the San Andreas Fault that experts believe could unleash the next major earthquake. Seismologist Lucy Jones, of the US Geological Survey, said the fault is the most likely of California’s 300 to produce a major earthquake. GETTY DEVASTATION: Thousands of people could die if a magnitude 7 earthquake struck California “When we have a big San Andreas earthquake it’ll be felt in Las Vegas and in Arizona. It may be felt in the Bay Area,” she said. The damage and death unleashed by an earthquake that size would be catastrophic, Jones said. She estimates more than 1,800 people would die, around 300,000 homes would be destroyed and £160billion ($213billion) in damages would be incurred.

Residents in the city of Hualien have been told to stay away from their damaged homes, and about 800 have taken shelter in community buildings. Hualien, a popular tourist hub, is home to about 100,000 people. Images from the city showed tilted structures, scattered debris and extensive damage to roads in the area. Among the several badly damaged buildings was a hospital, local media said. Emergency responders, including soldiers, worked through the night, rescuing about 150 people from damaged buildings, but powerful aftershocks have disrupted rescue efforts.

One member of staff has been rescued, but another two are said to be still be trapped in the building. ""We know there are people who are trapped inside - we can see lights inside the hotel,"" eyewitness Zeena Starbuck told the BBC. ""People with phones are shining their lights to let people know they're there."" People in the city are on edge and have been left shaken, correspondents say, as the earthquake comes exactly two years after a previous quake in the Taiwanese city of Tainan that killed at least 116 people. At least two other people are known to be trapped in residential properties, officials say. About 40,000 homes are without water, and highways and bridges have been closed. Media caption Children are lifted from a partially collapsed building in Taiwan Offices and schools in the city will remain closed on Wednesday. President Tsai Ing-wen travelled to Hualien early on Wednesday. ""The government team has now been mobilised and will work on disaster relief as fast as they can,"" said a statement from her office. Image copyright EPA Image caption Rescue services are continuing the search for people in a damaged building in Hualien People reported feeling the quake in the island's capital, Taipei, more than 160km (100 miles) away. Taiwan has been rocked by more than 100 earthquakes so far this month, according to the government. The island sits near a junction of two tectonic plates and is regularly hit by earthquakes. Taiwan has for all practical purposes been independent since 1950, but China regards it as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland. Are you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

Brittany Vonow,"SURREY has been rocked by a 2.7 magnitude earthquake today - the second in just 12 hours. The quake was the sixth to shake the area near both Gatwick and Heathrow airports in just four weeks - and raised the spectre of a Big One hitting London. A tremor was recorded this morning, with seismologists seeing a spike just after 1.30pm Locals have blamed fracking for the alarming spike in seismic activity, with previous quakes including a 2.6 magnitude tremor felt in parts of Surrey and West Sussex on June 27 and a quake measuring 2.6 recorded on June 30. Professor Peter Styles has warned extracting gas from former coal mining areas “dramatically enhances"" the risk of earthquakes, the Independent reported. Today's 2.7 tremor was recorded at Newdigate, which is eight miles from Gatwick and 30 miles from Heathrow, just after 1.30pm. It was less than a mile below the surface. Just hours earlier, a tremor was recorded at 4.59am at Newdigate at a magnitude of 2.0. Large earthquakes are extremely rare in Britain but scientists recently uncovered two fault lines running directly under London. SEISMIC ALERT: NEWDIGATE,SURREY 18 JULY 2018 13:33 UTC 2.7 ML — BGS (@BritGeoSurvey) July 18, 2018 Geophysicist Heather Savage on geological connections between fracking and earthquakes The quake was recorded just after 1.30pm today Keith Taylor, Green MEP for the South East, has previously called for a temporary halt on the extraction of fossils fuels until scientists can prove local drillers were not to blame. He told The Independent : ""Extraction of unconventional energy has caused tremors in other places, including Blackpool, so it would be rather reckless of us to say ‘go on, carry on’."" When two low-magnitude earthquakes hit an area in Lancashire where fracking was being tested in 2011, a study found it ""highly probable"" that they had been triggered by the technique. However, those in the fracking industry claim that issues pollution have only arisen due to bad practice, and cite the potential economic benefits for the UK. What is fracking and why is it controversial? Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock. It works by drilling into the earth before injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into the rock to release the gas inside. After first being approved for commercial use in 1950, it has been extensively used in the US, where it is credited with boosting oil production and driving down petrol prices. While the natural gas extracted from fracking produces significantly less carbon dioxide than other fossil fuels, such as coal, the technique has faced widespread condemnation from environmentalists. One concern surrounds the sheer quantity of water required to complete the process, with anti-fracking campaigners arguing that this comes at a significant environmental cost. There are also fears that potentially carcinogenic chemicals could escape and contaminate the water supply around fracking sites. Newdigate was hit with two small tremors in less than 12 hours An aerial image shows the Ibstock Brick quarry at Newdigate, Surrey Another tremor was felt in the early hours of this morning in the same area The US Geological Survey (USGS) has previously claimed environmentalists' claims that fracking could cause earthquakes was not true. According to its website: ""Hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as ‘fracking’, does not appear to be linked to the increased rate of magnitude 3 and larger earthquakes"". It comes as fears a big earthquake could hit after scientists discovered two fault lines running under London. Researchers claimed the shaking would be similar to standing on a platform between two passing trains. Dr Richard Ghail, a specialist in civil and environmental engineering at Imperial College told the Telegraph the chance of a quake is ""enough to be scary, but not fundamentally a problem"". He claimed the biggest issue is not the earthquake itself but the impacts because of the city's ""complicated"" infrastructure. The two faults move around 1mm to 2mm a year, with one running directly under central London and the other under Canary Wharf. We pay for your stories!

Todd Pittman / AP,"(TANJUNG) — The rescue team had done everything it could to locate the body of man, who had been killed instantly when a massive earthquake collapsed his home Sunday night on the Indonesian island of Lombok. They used hacksaws to cut a square into concrete wall. They used crowbars and dogs and a power drill. But by Tuesday afternoon, with the unmistakable stench of rotting flesh in the air, they were sweating and at their wits’ end. The body of 60-year-old Abdul Malik, one of at least 105 people killed in the 7.0-magnitude quake, would have to stay under the rubble for a third day. “It’s taking far too long,” said 50-year-old Masini, the victim’s brother-in-law who watched more than a dozen helmeted emergency workers in orange jumpsuits drill into a thick layer of concrete. The tragic scene underscored the challenges facing Indonesia’s government as it struggles to deal with its latest natural disaster. The quake shattered homes and lives across this vast archipelago, displacing more than 84,000 people, according to disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. At least 4,600 foreign and Indonesian tourists also have been evacuated from three smaller islands off Lombok’s coast so far, Nugroho said. The islets are renowned for their crystal clear waters that draw snorkelers and divers from all over the world. But with not enough boats to evacuate tourists quickly and too few planes to fly them out of Lombok, many visitors were forced to wait for hours or camp on beaches and the floor of the international airport in Mataram. On the winding roads running north from the airport, which lead to destroyed villages shadowed by tall palm trees, the disaster’s impact was evident. Villagers fearing aftershocks could be seen camped by the thousands under makeshift blue tarpaulins held together with bamboo and sticks. Some held up simple cardboard signs begging for aid as ambulances and other vehicles raced by. “We need food and water,” said one. “Please donate,” said another. The international charity Oxfam said drinking water was scarce because of a recent spell of extremely dry weather in Lombok. Food, medical supplies, tarps and clothes are also urgently needed, it said. By late Tuesday, the government appeared to be focused on finding bodies, and wherever possible, survivors. Masini said his brother-in-law, Abdul Malik, who owned a small grocery store next to his home in Tanjung, was sitting in his living room with family when the catastrophe struck. Although his family managed to make it out, Abdul Malik was crushed by a thick concrete wall. The rescuers are working “too slow,” Masini said. “They should be bringing in heavy equipment to speed this up.” Aprintinus Titus, from the National Search and Rescue Agency, acknowledged they needed better tools. But he said “we will not give up until we pull him out of this rubble. We know how hard his family is suffering.” A few miles up the road, rescuers earlier Tuesday pulled a single body from a pancaked pile of broken concrete and twisted rebar that once held together the multistory Jabal Nur Mosque, whose green dome had shattered and collapsed. A 66-year-old village elder, Supardi, said a 6.4-magnitude quake that hit Lombok a week earlier had caused countless cracks in the mosque’s walls. Those were going to be repaired, he said, but people were just getting over the first quake and more than half the village’s 1,500 people were sleeping outside. Large earthquakes are often followed by less-powerful aftershocks. But “nobody expected a stronger quake would occur in such a short amount of time,” said Supardi, who said he was praying in the mosque when the tremor hit. He described a roar that knocked out the electricity and sent people fleeing outside. “It destroyed everything,” he said. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries. By Tuesday evening, the search effort at the mosque ended after dogs failed to find more bodies and no other families reported missing loved ones there, said Anak Agung Alit Supartana, who heads the region’s Search and Rescue Agency office. There had been reports that dozens of people were killed at the site. Supartana said two people had been found alive, along with three bodies. But the rescuers and heavy equipment were “very much needed elsewhere, so we decided to shift the operation” to other locations. As it turned out, one was the crushed home of Masini’s brother-in-law. The teams and one excavator arrived after dark Tuesday to investigate. But officials said they would have to resume their search for the body there at first light Wednesday.","At least 105 people have killed and 84,000 displaced",2018-08-08T01:50:04Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Indonesia Struggles to Recover the Dead After Devastating Earthquake,http://time.com/5360625/indonesia-earthquake-recovery-aftermath/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gettyimages-1012582466.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,tremor,1
Stephanie Mlot,"Anecdotal evidence of animals exhibiting strange behavior before an earthquake dates back centuries. In 373 BC, rats, snakes, and weasels reportedly made a mass exodus from Helice days before a devastating tremor hit the Greek city. But you don’t need to run for cover under the kitchen table next time Fido starts howling or your dairy cows are producing less milk. According to a new study, there is no real proof that animals can predict earthquakes. “The reports of conspicuous behavior are numerous, but it could have other causes,” Heiko Woith, a scientist at the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences, said in a statement. “We have looked more closely at such studies and investigated whether there is a statistical correlation between seismic activity and animal behavior.” The first comprehensive analysis was published this week in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America. Researchers dug through more than 700 records alleging unusual conduct of 130-plus species (from sheep and goats and snakes and fish), related to 160 quakes of magnitude M 5.6 or higher between 2000 and 2012. Reports came from two dozen countries, most notably New Zealand, Japan, Italy, and Taiwan. Among other things, Woith and his team investigated the effect of foreshocks—mild tremors that precede the violent shaking of an earthquake. Assuming such vibrations are felt at a distance of 100 kilometers (62 miles) for animals, researchers looked for the existence of foreshocks in the area within 60 days. The result: 16 percent of main shocks were preceded by micro-trembles inside two months. But only 7 percent occurred within one day, and 3 percent transpired within one hour. Which suggests that at least some of the reported animal precursors are related to foreshocks, and perhaps can predict an earthquake. Well, maybe. Much of this “evidence” consists of single observations that cannot be carefully tested. “One has to keep in mind that a number of earthquakes are not announced by degassing or other signs, but literally occur spontaneously,” Woith explained. “An accurate prediction of the location, magnitude, and time of a quake seems, according to everything we know, to be impossible,” he continued. “And a reliable early warning on the basis of foreshocks or release of gases from the ground has many uncertainties and has, so far, not succeeded even with the most modern sensors.” Let us know what you like about Geek by taking our survey.","Anecdotal evidence of animals exhibiting strange behavior before an earthquake dates back centuries.

If you’ve ever worked in tech support or system administration (or have been on the receiving end of stories by people doing that work), a common trope features someone (usually a boss of some sort) thinking they’ve stumbled across a bug when in fact it’s user error. That’s not where this story goes… I was working in a job running the campus email system some years ago when I got a call from the chairman of the statistics department. “We’re having a problem sending email out of the department.” “What’s the problem?” I asked. “We can’t send mail more than 500 miles,” the chairman explained. I choked on my latte. “Come again?” “We can’t send mail farther than 500 miles from here,” he repeated. “A little bit more, actually. Call it 520 miles. But no farther.” “Um… Email really doesn’t work that way, generally,” I said, trying to keep panic out of my voice. One doesn’t display panic when speaking to a department chairman, even of a relatively impoverished department like statistics. “What makes you think you can’t send mail more than 500 miles?” “It’s not what I *think*,” the chairman replied testily. “You see, when we first noticed this happening, a few days ago—” “You waited a few DAYS?” I interrupted, a tremor tinging my voice. “And you couldn’t send email this whole time?” “We could send email.

Reuters,"Hundreds of people on Hawaii's Big Island were ordered to evacuate their homes after the Kilauea Volcano erupted, belching ash into the sky and spewing fountains of lava in a residential area, officials said on Friday. The volcano, one of five on the island, erupted on Thursday after a series of earthquakes over the last couple of days, including a 5.0 tremor earlier in the day, the U.S. Geological Survey reported on its website. Residents in the Puna communities of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions, home to about 1,700 people, were ordered to evacuate after public works officials reported steam and lava spewing from a crack, according to the county's Civil Defense Agency. One local, Michael Hale, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser he saw lava bursting from the fissure just two blocks from his home and business, Hale Hale Hostel and Vacation Rentals. ""I looked around and asked myself 'What's valuable?,'"" he told the newspaper. ""In that moment, nothing looked valuable. I filled the (truck) cab with mostly junk and that was it."" Two emergency shelters were opened to take in evacuees, the Civil Defense Agency said, while Governor David Ige activated the Hawaii National Guard to provide emergency help. ""Please be alert and prepare now to keep your family safe,"" he said on Twitter to residents living near the volcano. No injuries or deaths were reported. Another resident, Ikaika Marzo, told Hawaii News Now that he saw ""fountains"" of lava as high as 125 feet (38 meters). Others also told the news network they smelled burning brush and heard tree branches snapping. The Hawaii Fire Department reported extremely high levels of dangerous sulfur dioxide gas detected in the evacuation area, the Civil Defense Agency said. ""Elderly, young, and people with respiratory issues need to comply with the mandatory evacuation order and leave the area,"" the agency said in a statement on Friday. Footage from a drone aired on the Hawaii News Now website showed lava incinerating trees as it crept near structures. A 492-foot-long (150-meter) fissure erupted with lava for about two hours in Leilani Estates at about 5:30 p.m. local time, the Hawaii Volcano Observatory said on its website. Lava, which can reach temperatures of about 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit (1,150 Celsius), spread less than about 10 meters (33 feet) from the fissure, the observatory said. ""The opening phases of fissure eruptions are dynamic and uncertain. Additional erupting fissures and new lava outbreaks may occur,"" it said. A plume of red ash rose from the volcano's Pu'u 'O'o vent high into the sky over the island, according to photos on social media. Production at the Puna Geothermal plant was suspended until further notice, the Civil Defense Agency said on Friday, while Hawaii Electric Light said crews were disconnecting power in the areas affected by the active lava flow. The Kilauea Volcano has been erupting nearly continuously for more than three decades. Lava flows from the volcano have covered 48 square miles (125 square km), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Local officials closed volcano viewing areas while a portion of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was also closed. Reporting by Brendan O'Brien.

AP,"By: AP | San Jose | Published:November 13, 2017 10:04 am Electricity was knocked out in some areas as power lines and poles fell, but there were no reports of major infrastructure damage from the tremor, which hit in a lightly populated area on the Pacific Coast. (Source: The Weather Channel/Twitter) A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.5 shook Costa Rica on Sunday night, knocking items from shelves and sending people rushing outside in panic. The country’s Public Safety Ministry said there were reports of two serious injuries as a result of the quake, but did not provide additional details. Electricity was knocked out in some areas as power lines and poles fell, but there were no reports of major infrastructure damage from the tremor, which hit in a lightly populated area on the Pacific Coast. The government reported some rockslides obstructing highways near the epicenter. The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was centered about 10 miles (15 kilometers) southeast of the town of Jaco, which is about 60 (100 kilometers) miles southwest of the capital, San Jose. The quake was at a depth of about 12 miles (20 kilometers). Magdalena Lopez, who lives in Jaco, said the tremor started softly, but quickly strengthened. “When we were trying to get out of the house it started to shake again very strongly,” she said. “All of our neighbors were in the street. In front of my house there is an overlook some people started to go up, but it quickly started to shake again.” Four minutes after the initial earthquake, a magnitude 5.2 aftershock struck. President Luis Guillermo Solis said via Twitter that the government was still gathering information. He urged people to remain calm and prepare for aftershocks. Matt Hogan was at home in Punta Uvita, about a 90-minute drive down the coast from the epicenter when the earthquake hit around 8:30 p.m. He said the shaking whipped up two-foot waves in his swimming pool and knocked over glasses and containers in the kitchen.

Alexandra Witze,"The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California damaged many buildings in San Francisco. Credit:Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG/Getty The earthquake begins at 4:18 p.m. as a violent shudder, and rips along the Hayward Fault east of San Francisco, California. By the time the magnitude-7 event is over, buildings and roads throughout the region have collapsed, water pipes have shattered and fires rage. Eight hundred people are dead, tens of thousands have become homeless, and many who are still in their homes will go without running water for weeks to months. Fortunately, this is only a hypothetical scenario — for now. The US Geological Survey (USGS) devised it to think through how emergency officials, city managers and the public might respond to a big earthquake that could plausibly strike the region. The scenario, released on 18 April, draws on lessons that scientists have learned from a spate of recent natural disasters. It's the most detailed simulation yet of how an urban area might fare after a quake 1. Notably, the exercise explores how businesses, such as those in nearby Silicon Valley, can make themselves more resilient in the face of disaster. The USGS calls the scenario HayWired because a Hayward quake could disrupt Internet connectivity in the Bay Area. “This is a scientifically defensible story of the type of thing you should be getting ready for,” says Lucy Jones, a former USGS seismologist who now heads the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society in Burbank, California. HayWired follows a similar exercise in southern California a decade ago. Spearheaded by Jones, the ‘ShakeOut’ scenario envisioned a magnitude-7.8 quake hitting the Los Angeles area. It was the first attempt to marry California’s known seismic risk with a detailed scenario that brought the danger home. “For years we had been talking about the Big One, but we weren’t really being specific about what we had in mind,” says Kenneth Hudnut, a geologist with the USGS in Pasadena, California, and a leader of the HayWired exercise. The USGS chose the Hayward fault this time because it has a 33% probability of experiencing a quake of magnitude 6.7 or greater in the next 25 years — the highest in the San Francisco Bay Area. Palaeoseismic studies show that the last nine earthquakes of this size on the Hayward have happened at roughly 150-year intervals. The most recent was a magnitude-6.8 tremor in October 1868, 150 years ago. Seismic surprises Today the fault runs through homes, transportation lines and the University of California’s Berkeley campus. Many buildings have been retrofitted to withstand strong shaking — but many have not. An earthquake hasn't significantly damaged the Bay Area since 1989, when the magnitude-6.9 Loma Prieta quake struck on the San Andreas Fault south of San Francisco. It killed 63 people and caused billions of dollars in destruction. HayWired draws lessons from recent quakes around the world. A magnitude-7.8 quake in Gorkha, Nepal, in 2015 triggered at least 25,000 landslides in steep terrain 2, so HayWired includes the possibility of landslides in the hills east of the bay. Then there is a magnitude-6 quake that struck just north of San Francisco in 2014, in the southern Napa Valley. The initial tremor caused part of a geological fault to slide by less than 10 centimetres — but over the following year, the ground slowly crept by at least another 30 centimetres 3. The HayWired scenario acknowledges that residents and business owners might delay building repairs for months to keep new construction from being damaged, which would prolong the post-quake economic slump. And the 2010–11 sequence of quakes near Christchurch, New Zealand, underscored the threat posed by aftershocks 4. The deadliest quake in the series was a magnitude-6.2 event that happened 5 months after the biggest shock, but killed 185 people because it struck near the city centre at lunchtime on a workday. The quakes “really emphasized to us how an earthquake is not just a one-off event to plan for and respond to”, says Sally Potter, a hazard and risk management researcher at GNS Science in Wellington, New Zealand. Building resilience Because of the Christchurch experience, the HayWired exercise simulates how two years of aftershocks would affect the Bay Area. “In some cases, the shaking is stronger from the aftershock than from the main shock,” says Anne Wein, an operations research analyst with the USGS in Menlo Park, California and a leader of the HayWired project. HayWired focuses on getting businesses back up and operating. The scenario suggests that one in four buildings in the region will be uninhabitable for months after a large quake — but that people are willing to pay more to meet stricter building regulations to keep structures functional. California’s state assembly is currently considering seismic-safety legislation that would require buildings to be safe to use immediately after a quake. “It’s not just making sure my employees don’t get crushed,” says Jones. “It’s how do I start up business afterward?”",Tremors in Nepal and New Zealand help scientists to predict how a magnitude-7.0 quake would affect the California city.,2018-04-18T00:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Nature.com'}",How San Francisco’s next big quake could play out,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04489-3?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nature%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Nature+-+Issue%29,https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04489-3/d41586-018-04489-3_15633010.jpg,,Nature.com,tremor,1
Jason Ward,"Microsoft's inclusive design mission is guiding the company in ensuring its products and services are designed from conception forward with every user of all ability levels in mind. Though the company has made admirable progress in this regard, it is still a work in progress. Microsoft's Seeing AI app helps people with blindness, Project Fizzyo supports children with Cystic Fibrosis, the Emma Watch and Project Emma aids people with Parkinson's Disease and Microsoft's Immersive Reader helps children with Dyslexia. There are millions of people with varying levels of abilities who are either excluded from interacting with the technologies of modern society or whose physical limitations prevent their full participation in everyday tasks. Microsoft has embraced the challenge of creating specific solutions, like the tremor-halting Emma Watch, which targets a particular aspect of a disability. It has also incorporated solutions that level the playing field into its technologies, like gaze control in Windows, which enables people with immobility to navigate the OS. Given this integrated solution for people with para- or quadriplegia, a similar OS level solution that enables Windows or Cortana to understand sign language for the 466 million people with disabling hearing loss, in a world where ""speaking to AI is becoming the norm"" seems like a natural goal for Microsoft. And given that a developer ""modified Alexa"" to do just that we know that it's also possible. If Alexa can do it so can Cortana/Windows Developer Abhishek Singh created a web application that uses a camera to view and understand sign language which is then translated and spoken and heard by Alexa via Amazon's Echo. A typed response is then provided by the system that can be read by the user after Alexa speaks her response. Using machine learning platform Tensorflow, Singh trained an A.I. to understand American Sign Language and used Google's text-to-speech to translate the signs into spoken words. Singh said, ""The project was…inspired by observing a trend among companies of pushing voice-based assistants as a way to create instant, seamless interactions."" Given Microsoft's A.I. and machine learning investments, its Cognitive Services that recognize human faces, activities, speech and more and the role of the camera in Windows PCs for biometrics Microsoft has the end-to-end resources to create a system that can communicate with users who use sign language. Inclusion is what Microsoft is about Most companies have some degree of dedication to inclusive design. Microsoft is not unique in that regard. Microsoft is unique, however, in that its CEO Satya Nadella is personally driven toward inclusion goals due to his experience raising two children with disabilities including his son Zane who has severe Cerebral Palsy. This has led Nadella to promote a pervasive empathy mission throughout Microsoft that imbues its inclusive design efforts with a depth of sincerity, a level of detail and broad scope that makes it stand out in the industry. Windows now has gaze technology as a result of a hackathon that enabled a former NFL great with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) play with his son despite using a wheelchair. Immersive Reader is integrated throughout Microsoft's cross-platform products like OneNote enabling school systems and parents to support children with Dyslexia and other disabilities. Sign language recognition built into Windows/Cortana would be a systemic component of the platform that fits naturally with Microsoft's other efforts. Including sign language recognition is a must Cortana navigates a meeting with a deaf person in attendance. If Microsoft's products are meant to be used by everyone then sign language recognition must be a part of the equation. Though the companies digital assistant and smart speaker efforts have paled in comparison to the success rivals are enjoying Microsoft still has a case for making this move. At build 2018 Microsoft demonstrated Cortana's navigating a meeting, transcribing the conversation, responding to participants and providing text that a deaf/hard of hearing participant could read. A natural progression to such a scenario would be including sign language recognition for people with deafness who do not speak or others who rely on sign language who are unable to speak. Microsoft's partnership with Amazon by bringing Cortana and Alexa together shows that it is serious about keeping its ambient computing efforts visible in the consumer space. Perhaps bringing sign language recognition to Windows and Cortana could be boosted by similar or joint efforts integrated into Alexa. However it pans out, it just needs to happen. I hope Microsoft agrees.",Microsoft's inclusive design efforts must include sign language recognition in Windows 10 and Cortana to support the deaf and hard of hearing community.

Robert Hackwill,"An earth tremor has hit the Zofiowka coal mine in the town of Jastrzebie-Zdroj southern Poland, releasing high concentrations of methane gas, and trapping at least five miners below ground. Intially seven men were caught in the accident, but two have been rescued. ""We had no contact with seven people, eight rescue units reached two miners who got up to the surface and now are being medically treated. We have no contact with five other miners. There are three rescue units more joining the operation which is going on,"" said JSW Coal's Daniel Ozon. The mine is near the border with the Czech Republic, and is preparing a new corridor for extraction works at a depth of 900 metres. It has never experienced such a large tremor before. The two recovered miners have been injured. The remaining 239 people who were underground when the tremor occurred escaped to the surface safely. Rescuers cannot currently go to the site because of high methane levels in the mine. After the tremor these reached well over 50%, and had only fallen to 40% some 12 hours later, TVN24 said the tremor was also felt on the surface and shook some houses. Initially JSW said there was some hope the missing miners could have taken another exit but it was later revealed there was just one way out. Coal mining is a major industry in Poland and coal remains the main source of energy and heating. The Main Statistical Office says some 65.8 million metric tons, (58.7 million tonnes), of coal were extracted last year, some 4.8 million tons less than in 2016.","An earth tremor has hit the Zofiowka coal mine in the town of Jastrzebie-Zdroj southern Poland, releasing high concentrations of methane gas, and trapping at",2018-05-06T07:58:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Euronews.com'}",Unprecedented tremor traps Polish miners underground,http://www.euronews.com/2018/05/06/unprecedented-tremor-traps-polish-miners-underground,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/14/60/84/1000x563_cmsv2_47d6aa3c-b532-5102-9989-c47d10aa9937-3146084.jpg,,Euronews.com,tremor,1
