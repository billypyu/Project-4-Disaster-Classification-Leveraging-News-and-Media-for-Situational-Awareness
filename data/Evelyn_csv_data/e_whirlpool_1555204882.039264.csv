Daniel Cooper,"Yummly's app has been reengineered with computer vision smarts that'll come in handy when you've got a half-stocked refrigerator and no idea what to eat. Use your smartphone's camera to scan all of the items in the coolbox and its computer vision chops will divine a recipe for you. Once you've decided what you're going to cook, the information will be pushed to one of a new range of Whirlpool cookers. A small, 5-inch wide touchscreen on the stovetop will then display step-by-step instructions for each phase of the recipe. So, it'll tell you when you've got to throw your chicken, or asparagus, into the pan, and then when the requisite time has elapsed, tell you to turn it over. And, the hope is, you'll be able to churn out better-looking, and better-tasting, meals with what would otherwise go to waste. Unfortunately, the future of cooking is still a few months away, and even when it gets here, it's going to be at the higher end of the price spectrum. But it's something to bear in mind when it comes to getting your kitchen replaced in the next couple of years. Nicole Lee contributed to this report.

Jon Fingas,"Certain appliances have extra perks. The Smart Front Control Range and Smart Over the Range Microwave tie into Yummly's recipe app to help you cook -- you can send instructions directly to the appliance, complete with images and video. You can scan UPC barcodes on some frozen food to get directions as well. Amazon Virtual Dash can restock connected refrigerators, while the Smart All-in-One Washer and Dryer can send laundry alerts to your Apple Watch. Even the Smart Energy Star Certified Dishwasher can talk to your Nest devices and hold the washing cycle until you've left for work. Whirlpool hasn't discussed pricing, but you should see its 2018 roster arrive sometime in the spring.

Shannon Liao,"Whirlpools new smart oven concept uses augmented reality to show you where to place your croissants and pizza. Its called the Whirlpool Connected Hub Wall Oven, and the AR aspect makes it a little bit unique within the smart oven category.
The oven has a 27-inch transparent LCD display on its front door, which you can use to pull up recipes. Once you select a recipe, the screen will tell you to gather the necessary ingredients and then display where to place food on the racks. In the demo I got to see, the oven suggested placing salmon on a top rack and asparagus on the bottom so that both items would be well-cooked at the same time.
AR comes into play in a couple of ways here, although it doesnt look as impressive as it sounds. Youre able to see how the meal should look when its finished cooking; so in my example, a floating salmon dish would hover on the front door before disappearing. And you can also see visualizations of where to place the trays. As someone who had to learn through trial and error to put the spinach puffs up top and the pizza on the lower rack, I would definitely find this feature useful.
This is what the interface looks like. On the display, these colors dont show up very well.
Image: Whirlpool
While everythings cooking, an internal camera allows you to check up on your food and even zoom in for a better look. Its a convenient way to see if your crust is golden brown but not yet burnt without opening your oven door, which might affect the bake.
Unfortunately, Whirlpools transparent screen doesnt look great. The salmon looked grayish on the screen, and WLabs, the Whirlpool incubator behind the oven, said that because the display is transparent, it couldnt be designed with a higher pixel density or more vibrant colors. 
Because its just a concept, theres no release date or even a rough estimate of availability for the oven. And WLabs says it will likely take a lot of further iterations and feedback from users before it reaches a final version.
For the time being, there are plenty ofother smart oven options out there that are trying to simplify the baking process, including another option from WLabs, which is going on sale later this year.","Whirlpool’s new smart oven concept uses augmented reality to show you where to place your croissants and pizza.

Adam Rosenberg,"You ever get the feeling that you're just a tiny, insignificant speck floating free in the vast ocean of our universe? If the answer is ""no"" then you haven't been spending enough time on the Hubble Space Telescope's YouTube channel.
A video posted late last month offers a detailed view of one of our Milky Way's neighbors, the Whirlpool Galaxy. The three-minute assemblage of photos and 3D visualizations breaks down the anatomy of the galaxy using data pulled from three sources.
Hubble itself only captured the visual imagery, actual photographs. The video's infrared imaging comes from the Spitzer Space Telescope, while the x-ray imaging comes from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Captions in the video guide viewers through a process of peeling away the Whirlpool Galaxy's layers, and looking at them across different spectral bands and wavelengths.

The appliance comes with a ""built-in Ask Alexa button"" for you to talk to the assistant. At its event, an Amazon executive said ""Alexa, one potato"" to the microwave, and it set a timer and turned on. He then said ""Alexa, add 30 seconds to the microwave,"" and the assistant updated the countdown. He also told Alexa to stop the microwave. The device will be shipping later this year.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Slow waves meander westward out in the deep ocean south of Australia. Sometimes they carry with them carry large eddies, whirlpools over 100 miles across. But every so often, these whirlpools combine into double whirlpools and travel across the ocean 10 times faster than the rest of the whirlpools, moving in sync for months and potentially transporting minerals and nutrients with them. Scientists announced their observations of these “modons” for the first time in a new paper based on satellite data. These double whirlpools are important for more than just proving a theorized but previously unobserved oceanic anomaly, though. They could perhaps explain a new way to transport water quickly to other parts of the ocean. “Especially in the Tasman Sea, they represent an unusual pathway for propagation of water with different properties into the open ocean,” the authors write in the study, published this month in Geophysical Research Letters. Here’s the thing about Earth: It’s a big, spinning ball. That comes with consequences for the things not firmly attached to the planet itself, like the atmosphere and the oceans, which experience a “Coriolis force,” in which some objects’ paths bend as they travel away from or towards the poles. The different amount of bending at different latitudes in the ocean manifests as “Rossby waves,” a slow and westward movement of disturbances in the ocean water. That creates enormous circles of water called mesoscale eddies, which slowly travel westward—think of these eddies like the ocean weather patterns. Through satellite observations, scientists saw that when two of these eddies link up to create the “modon,” crazy things happen. Rather than travel westward at speeds of 1-2 centimeters per second (like,.02 to.04 miles per hour, literally the speed of a snail ), they might travel eastward at 10-20 centimeters per second (a lightning fast.2 to.4 miles per hour, which is perhaps closer to the speed of a tortoise ). Sorry if you were picturing super-fast vortexes of ocean water—but this video does speed things up a bit: These double whirlpools aren’t like, horrible ship-killing storms, nor are they “fast moving” except by comparison to how fast (i.e., very slow) they normally move. But they haven’t been observed before, and the researchers speculate that the behavior could have important implications for ocean life. These faster-moving whirlpools bring colder water to places where the water is usually warm, and vice versa. Perhaps they even transport food and nutrients for sea life. The scientists have hit a sort-of limit of how well they can probe these eddies with today’s technology, and hope that new satellites, like the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite, can help increase their understanding. The exciting thing about this research is that the ocean is still managing to surprise us even today, from its deepest depths to its churning surface.

Cherlynn Low,"Another reason the KitchenAid display is helpful for aspiring chefs is its Yummly integration. You can ask Google Assistant to search the service for recipes of your favorite food. Since Yummly is owned by KitchenAid's parent company Whirlpool, the smart display also comes with an exclusive Yummly Pro portal that offers premium chef content. Otherwise, Yummly is also available on the Lenovo Smart Display.
Unfortunately, the demo unit we saw wasn't actually up and running, and was looping a video instead, so we didn't get to test most of the features. But I did get to lift the device, and based on our experience, it's a bit lighter than the Lenovo Smart Display.
It's also a bit different seeing the KitchenAid display in person as opposed to looking at the press pictures. Rudimentary, functional, basic and practical were a few words my colleague and I threw about when thinking about how to describe the device's appearance. Don't get me wrong, I like it (as you can tell from my subheadline), but its design is indeed quite generic. There's nothing wrong with generic, though.

Frederic Lardinois,"One of Google’s first hardware products was its search appliance, a custom-built server that allowed businesses to bring Google’s search tools to the data behind their firewalls. That appliance is no more, but Google today announced the spiritual successor to it with an update to Cloud Search. Until today, Cloud Search only indexed G Suite data. Now, it can pull in data from a wide variety of third-party services that can run on-premise or in the cloud, too, making the tool far more useful for large businesses that want to make all of their data searchable by their employees. “We are essentially taking all of Google expertise in search and are applying it to your enterprise content,” Google said. One of the launch customers for this new service is Whirlpool, which built its own search portal and indexed over 12 million documents from more than a dozen services using this new service. “This is about giving employees access to all the information from across the enterprise, even if it’s traditionally siloed data whether that’s in a database or a legacy productivity tool and make all of that available in a single index,” Google explained. To enable this functionality, Google is making a number of software adapters available that will bridge the gap between these third-party services and Cloud Search. Over time, Google wants to add support for more services and bring this cloud-based technology on par with what its search appliance was once capable of.","One of Google’s first hardware products was its search appliance, a custom-built server that allowed businesses to bring Google’s search tools to the data behind their firewalls.

Ashlee Clark-Thompson,"Whirlpool introduced this smart refrigerator in a color called sunset bronze at this year's CES in Las Vegas. Chris Monroe/CNET It's a risky move to buy a suite of internet-connected kitchen appliances. First, there's the thousands of dollars you'll need to drop. Then, you have to consider the lifespan of an oven, fridge or dishwasher. You want these products to last a decade, but will the tech that makes them smart quickly become out of date? And there's the most important, practical question: Do you really need an appliance that you can control from your phone or with your voice? Whirlpool has become the manufacturer that could finally convince you to take the plunge and buy some smart kitchen appliances that will connect you to the rest of the smart home movement. The century-old company has partnered with big names in tech and food-centric startups, upgraded both large and small appliances with Wi-Fi capabilities, and focused on cool features to make it more appealing to invest in its smart appliances. Whirlpool isn't the only company that wants you to put down massive coins for its smart kitchen products. GE Appliances recently introduced a touchscreen hub for the space above your stove that the company wants to become the command center for your life. Samsung is still putting touchscreen hubs in its fridges. And multiple manufacturers such as LG have integrated with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, the digital assistants that enable you to give voice commands to connected appliances and other products. So what makes Whirlpool stand out? Inclusivity Like LG and GE Appliances, Whirlpool's Wi-Fi-enabled appliance works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. But Whirlpool's announcement that it would release an Apple Watch app this year made it the first appliance company to work with a smart watch platform. Cooperation with Amazon, Google and Apple shows that Whirlpool wants to make products that make it easier for you to tie your appliance into the platform you already prefer, rather than drop your favorite operating system for something new and unproven (looking at you, Samsung and Bixby). That Apple integration could also put Whirlpool in a good spot when Apple's take on the smart home speaker, the HomePod, comes out this month. Whirlpool's Wi-Fi-enabled microwave learns your cooking habits. Chris Monroe/CNET The company thinks small One of Whirlpool's most interesting products at CES this year was its over-the-range microwave. The company first introduced the Wi-Fi-enabled microwave in 2017, but the appliance will have some new capabilities this year, such as limited integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. The microwave also works with a Scan-to-Cook feature in Whirlpool's app in which you scan the bar codes of packaged foods to send cooking instructions to the appliance. The microwave will also learn your cooking habits based on which settings you use the most; for example, if you select the same oatmeal setting every morning, that option will eventually become the first thing that pops up on the microwave's touch panel control. These microwave innovations are significant because it brings the type of technology we've seen in large appliances to smaller and cheaper products. Not ready to buy an oven that costs more than $1,000? You can start with a $619 microwave (not cheap, but cheaper than an oven or a range). Whirlpool doesn't have a monopoly on smart microwaves. GE Appliances has a over-the-range microwave that uses Bluetooth to connect to ranges so the exhaust fan and lights automatically come on when you turn on a burner. That's a practical approach, but it's not as forward looking as the features on Whirlpool's smart microwave. Smart features that are fun and useful We've seen companies throw in some connected features that aren't very useful, like LG's near-field communication (NFC) on its ovens that let you change the oven settings from your phone (but you still had to be close to your oven) or Dacor's oven with a built-in tablet that quickly became out of date. Whirlpool, however, has added connected capabilities to its smart kitchen products that I suspect people will actually use. Whirlpool's Apple Watch app will let you glance at your wrist for status updates about your oven (along with your washing machine and dryer). This is a use case that makes sense, a quality that isn't always present in smart appliances. Whirlpool has also brought convenience onto its kitchen appliances. A new Whirlpool refrigerator has Amazon Dash integration so you can put free, virtual Dash Buttons for your groceries on the fridge's touchscreen. If you run out of paper towels, you just press a button on your fridge, and Amazon will send you more paper towels. Whirlpool has also used kitchen appliances to connect you to the rest of your home. A line of connected wall ovens from Whirlpool sub-brand Jenn-Air works with the Nest Learning Thermostat to cool off your home automatically when the oven starts cooking. The Yummly app will have a feature that allows you to scan your device's camera over a selection of foods, and the app will identify them and suggest receipes. Chris Monroe/CNET Cooperation with startups that know software Whirlpool was originally set to partner with a company called Innit to run the software in its smart appliances. That deal fell through, but Whirlpool bounced back with the purchase of Yummly, a recipe app that reportedly has more than a million users. It's through Yummly that Whirlpool introduced one of its coolest tools at this year's CES: a feature in which you scan food with your device's camera, and the app will recognize the food and suggest recipes based on what it sees. (This is in addition to the Scan-to-Cook feature I mentioned earlier, which will be a part of Whirlpool's app. I won't be surprised if these apps consolidate.) Whirlpool apparently knows that software isn't its strong suit, and wisely teamed up with a startup that specializes in creating an easy-to-use, interactive experience. GE Appliances and Bosch have also worked with startups such as Drop and Innit, but Whirlpool's work with Yummly and the food recognition feature is the most ambitious partnership. And that could draw the attention of existing Yummly users. Whirlpool has emerged as a leader in smart kitchen appliances. Its products' thoughtful features and integrations with other tech companies and products will make it easier and more appealing to add a connected kitchen appliance to your home. Other companies like Samsung have made strides in other areas of the smart home, but Whirlpool has thoughtfully gone after the folks who consider their kitchen the center of their household. Other manufacturers will surely keep refining the marriage between smart home and your cooking habits, but for now, Whirlpool kitchen appliances make the best case for adding internet-connected tech to your kitchen.","The company has spent the past year racking up partnerships with big names like Google, Amazon and Apple to make its smart appliances appeal to a broader audience than competitors.",2018-02-01T18:59:47Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Here's how Whirlpool could convince you to make your kitchen smart - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/whirlpool-has-made-it-easier-to-make-your-kitchen-smart/,https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/5uDAKgf66Xv1abUoYOxLnOJwqFc=/2018/01/08/ca7bd4bd-0800-4fde-950e-beb100e02e9e/whirlpool-ces-2018-13.jpg,,Cnet.com,whirlpool,1
Adam Clark Estes,"If you thought Echos were only good for invading your privacy and enticing hackers, then boy do I have some news for you. Amazon just introduced a new addition to the Smart Home Skill API for Alexa: cooking. Your voice-controlled assistant could potentially be burning down your house in no time! Alexa’s new cooking capabilities sound quaint for now. In an announcement blog post, Amazon developer Mike Maas said that the first Alexa-powered kitchen appliance would be a microwave from Whirlpool with support for “other cooking devices, such as conventional ovens,” coming soon. The announcement post also links to some developer documents that offer up examples for commands that include “Alexa, microwave the popcorn” and “Alexa, cook the pizza in the microwave.” (Pro tip: never put pizza in the microwave unless you want to eat a slab of soggy rubber with cheese on top.) GE Appliances, Kenmore, LG, and Samsung will soon announce Alexa cooking capabilities on kitchen appliances of their own. Microwaves seem like an easy entry-point for Alexa, our new artificially intelligent chef. Popcorn is so easy, and there are all these presets that make it even easier. But don’t be fooled. As we learned from the Oscar-nominated film American Hustle, bad things can happen if you use the science oven wrong. Here’s a clip: Okay okay, you’ve probably learned not to put metal in the microwave by now. But can you imagine? Your kid doesn’t learn so good and then he throws a can of Spaghetti-Os in your new Whirlpool microwave and tells Alexa to cook them for, I don’t know, 20 minutes. This is improbable, but it demonstrates that a human could tell a robot to do something that would possibly cause your house to burn down. The idea of cooking with an Amazon Echo will spread beyond the microwave. Amazon says that Alexa-powered ovens are on the way, which makes you wonder about all the extra risk involved in an artificially intelligent robot controlling a machine that manipulates fire. One danger, for instance, could be the fact that Alexa controls mean physically visiting your oven won’t be necessary. How do you know that your silly kid didn’t hide his fireworks in there? Turning the broiler on to heat up a case of fireworks could also possibly cause your house to burn down. A few weeks ago, a couple friends and I were about to watch a surprisingly bad scifi movie in my… Read more Read These are crazy hypotheticals, but there’s also reason to wonder how well manufacturers will deal with adding these newfound Alexa cooking capabilities into internet-connected appliances. After all, the Internet of Things is infamously and relentlessly hackable. Countless companies have also struggled with building connected gadgets that simply work like they’re supposed to. Even juggernauts like GE have a scary track record of building bad technology. One would hope that developers will build safeguards into these new Alexa cooking capabilities. One would also hope that appliance manufacturers will integrate voice-controls with caution, since the technology is so new. It’s also encouraging that the Alexa Fund invested in the June Oven, a stupidly expensive oven that also happens to be stupidly amazing. That might mean that Amazon is really taking this cooking thing seriously. You should, too. That is, if you plan on using Alexa to control your microwave and your oven and whatever else in your kitchen can deals with fire and hot, hot heat. Safety first. Impressing your guests with a voice-controlled popcorn machine second. And hey, if all else fails, just use those knobs and buttons. Humans have been doing it for decades with only a limited number of kitchen fires.

Brian Heater,"Amazon wants to put Alexa in every room of your home — that much is clear. It’s the main reason the company offers the Echo in so many different form factors. The kitchen has been a key piece in that puzzle, but aside from some third-party refrigerators from companies like LG, Amazon hasn’t made too many inroad on that front. Starting this week, however, Alexa’s learning to cook. Amazon just added cooking to its list of Smart Skill APIs, a feature that will initially play itself out on microwave ovens. The company has already been working with Whirlpool to bring the functionality to its line of microwaves. Those devices are currently listed as “coming soon” — so who knows, maybe we’ll even see some of them at CES next week. The skills are pretty much what you’d expect out of an Alexa-enbabled microwave. Commands include things like “Alexa, defrost three pounds of chicken” and “Alexa, microwave for 50 seconds on high.” You can add time, trigger presets, change power modes and the like. That feature is available to developers in the US now as an API, with more countries coming soon. Amazon will also be adding skills to get Alexa working with conventional ovens at some point in the future. As for how practical the feature really is, it’s hard to say. Alexa can’t actually put the food in the microwave for you yet, so it’s really just saving you from pressing an extra couple of buttons. And, of course, when it comes to things like adding time, you really want to make sure you’re getting that voice input just right. The bigger picture here, though, is Amazon’s continued move into the kitchen — heck, even the last big Echo event took place in a faux kitchen set up. The ability to view recipes on a screen was seen as a big selling point for the Echo Show. And hey, now that the company owns Whole Foods, Amazon’s got a vested interest in controlling the kitchen. The company also took the opportunity to note that its Alexa Fund has invested in June Life, the makers of the smart June Oven, which already sports its own Alexa Skill.","Amazon wants to put Alexa in every room of your home — that much is clear.

EMILY S. RUEB,"There are many families that take pride in how they look, said Jo Carrigan, the schools principal, and dont want to send their children to school because they dont have clean clothes.
The school received a $10,000 grant to install a washing machine through a program organized by Whirlpool and Teach for America, which has installed commercial-grade machines at 72 schools in 13 cities.
The school used to have a washing machine for custodians in a dungeon-y area, Ms. Carrigan said. In January, the new machine was installed in a brightly lit room near the cafeteria, where students are invited to learn the basics of measuring detergent and clothing care. Ms. Carrigan said students with intellectual disabilities who are learning functional skills, like grocery shopping and using money, are also learning how to do laundry.
Ms. Carrigan said that the program was still in its infancy and that administrators were working with the schools psychologist to identify students who would benefit from the program.
A laundry program at West Side High School in Newark has changed the culture of the school and helped reduce bullying, said the schools principal, Akbar Cook.
Mr. Cook used a $20,000 grant from a local utility company to convert an old football locker room into a laundry room and has since been recognized by Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and the talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.
At the high school in Kentucky, the schools alumni association collected about $1,000 to buy a washing machine and dryer for the students and made plumbing and ventilation modifications to a supply closet.","Akbar Cook, the principal of West Side High School in Newark, on “Ellen” this month.

Fast forward to today and companies are being replaced approximately every two weeks. In this rapidly changing market, traditional companies are looking for ways to stay competitive and more and more enterprises, including Nielsen, Colgate and Airbus, are turning to G Suite to help them reimagine how they work to keep pace. We know that enterprises want to move to cloud-first collaboration to transform how they work, but, understandably, they have questions about how to make it work in a business of their size. What happens with email security? How can they manage their data? How does G Suite work with the tools and systems they already have in place? Yesterday we announced new products to help businesses reimagine how they work, and today we’re sharing additional solutions we’ve built to address these concerns. Here’s a snapshot of what we’re announcing today. Read on for more detail. New Gmail (Redesigned security warnings, Snooze, Offline Access and more generally available for G Suite users) Cloud Search (being deployed by an initial set of customers) Google Voice for G Suite (available in our Early Adopter Program*) Drive Enterprise Sku (available for purchase) Keeping businesses (and emails) secure Keeping your data secure is our top priority, which is why we use machine learning to analyze threat indicators across billions of messages in Gmail to help quickly identify potential security attacks in the making. Machine learning helps protect more than 1.4 billion active Gmail user accounts from nearly 10 million spam and malicious emails every minute. Today, we’re making the new Gmail generally available to G Suite customers so that, in addition to these baked-in security features, more companies can take advantage of features like redesigned security warnings, snooze, offline access and more. You can learn more in this post. Bringing the best of Google Search to enterprise data Searching through your company’s data should be as easy as doing a web search. But the reality is most companies’ information is spread across different silos and systems that don’t talk to each other, which makes finding things a lengthy chore. We introduced Cloud Search last year to make it easy to find information across G Suite in a way that’s intuitive and assistive. Today, we are announcing new Cloud Search functionality to help companies intelligently and securely index their third-party data beyond G Suite, whether that data is stored in the cloud, or on-prem. Companies, like Whirlpool Corporation, have started deploying Cloud Search’s new capabilities to unify search across multiple data sources. Using Cloud Search’s new SDKs, APIs and connectors for third-party connectivity, Whirlpool created a custom app called Whirlpool SearchPro that indexes more than 12 million documents across different on-prem and cloud systems and returns results in 100s of milliseconds on average. Moreover, search results reflect the specific permissions and access controls from each of the source systems to ensure that individuals only see the information they should.","In 1958, U.S. corporations remained on the S&P 500 index for an average of 61 years, according to the American Enterprise Foundation.

"ALAN BLINDER, THOMAS FULLER and MONICA DAVEY","[ Read more about how President Trump’s trade war with China affects soybean farmers.] Marion County, about an hour north of Columbus, does not treat its fair as a summertime rite of a bygone era. Drive around the county seat, where Warren G. Harding staged his “Return to Normalcy” campaign from his front porch in 1920, and you’ll see signs posted by businesses and civic institutions beckoning visitors to the fenced-in fairgrounds. The fair book for this year’s event, the 168th iteration, ran 92 pages. And on sale day, it seemed no sound — no midway ride, no crackling caldron of frying oil, no turkey’s gobble — rose above the cries and pleas of a short-sleeved auctioneer. You could hear him from the parking lot. You could hear him at the stand with $3 chocolate milkshakes. And, of course, you could hear him while you sidestepped hogs and the kids with pig whips. Mr. Ackerman, whose children used to show cattle, has been coming to the fair for decades. In that time, he has become increasingly wary of the trade imbalance between the United States and China. He does not expect, or even necessarily want, a perfect trade balance with Beijing; instead, he talks about a more “level playing field.” “They’re smart, shrewd people,” Mr. Ackerman says of Chinese importers, “and I tip my hat to them. If I was buying a bunch of grain, I’d be trying to buy it as cheap as I could, too.” Mr. Ackerman said he voted for President Trump and credits him with recognizing the trade issue’s urgency. “There’s enough win-wins that can be had in trade, and I think the United States in the past has not pressed for more of that win-win situation,” Mr. Ackerman said. He hopes that the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in recent weeks will inspire what he perceives as a crucially needed shift. But they could convulse Marion County, which, because of its farms and a Whirlpool factory that can make about 20,000 dryers a day, has a larger stake in the trade war than many places.","The county fair in Marion, Ohio, provided a cheerful refuge from the concerns of farmers about Chinese tariffs on soybeans, hogs and other products.",2018-07-09T22:49:59Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trade Politics Comes to the County Fair,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/us/trade-war-county-fair.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/10/us/10fairs-1-print/00fairs-top-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,whirlpool,1
MONEY,"Sparks fly as a robot lifts a panel on a Corolla assembly line, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2015 at the Toyota Motor Manufacturing plant in Blue Springs, Miss. AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis President Trump has promised to get tough on America's trading partners. But with the administration now slapping hefty duties on imported goods such as steel and washing machines, and threatening them on many others, it's American consumers who could be hurt. While Trump has long complained that trade agreements with nations like China and Mexico need to be renegotiated, his biggest move so far has been placing tariffs — import taxes, payable to the US government — on goods these countries import into the US. The taxes are meant to help US manufacturers by making foreign goods comparatively more expensive and, therefore, less attractive to consumers. Most economists disagree with Trump's approach, however, arguing that the tariffs could easily destroy more US jobs — mainly at companies forced to pay higher raw materials costs — than they create. ""Companies that can will pass the increased costs onto consumers,"" says Erica York, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank. ""If they can't pass them on, that will come out of profits, which means less money to hire or give raises."" The first tariffs, targeting a handful of consumer goods, debuted earlier this year; they were followed by taxes on raw steel and aluminum. Now a new wave focusing specifically on hundreds of Chinese industrial goods is set to go into effect in July. And Trump has threatened to target still more Chinese goods — possibly including many popular consumer items like televisions and cellphones. Here's a complete rundown of all the goods that could cost you more — or already do — as a result of Trump's trade war. Trump fired an initial shot in his trade war in January, targeting just two products — washing machines and solar panels. The administration placed a tax of 20% to 50% on large residential washing Machines after Whirlpool complained that foreign competitors, including Korean giants Samsung and LG, were unfairly undercutting its prices. The move initially helped Whirlpool — the company's stock jumped 5% and it said it would hire 200 workers — but the benefit was offset when the White House also slapped tariffs on imported steel (more on that in a bit), pushing up its costs. Now US consumers stand to lose. The Wall Street Journal, citing Labor Department data, recently estimated the average cost of washing machines had shot up 17% in just the past three months.","AP Photo/Rogelio V.

Matthew Lynley,"Stitch Fix, one of last year’s high-profile IPOs, has had a bumpy ride for the past few quarters — but it blew out expectations this afternoon for its most recent quarter, and the stock is going absolutely nuts. There’s also a ton of news coming out from the company today, including the hire of a new chief marketing officer as well as the launch of Stitch Fix Kids. All this is pretty good timing because the company appears to be cramming everything into one announcement that is serving as a very pleasant surprise to Wall Street, which is looking for as many signals as it can get that the subscription e-commerce company will end up as one of the more successful IPO stories. Shares of the company are up more than 14% after the release came out, where the company beat out expectations that Wall Street set across the board — which, while not the best barometer, serves as a somewhat public barometer as well as what helps determine whether or not it can lock up the best talent. Here’s the final line for the company : Q3 Revenue: $316.7 million, compared to $306.4 million in estimates from Wall Street and up 29% year-over-year. Q3 Earnings : 9 cents per share, compared to 3 cents per share in estimates from Wall Street. Cost of goods sold : $178.5 million, up from $139.7 million in Q3 last year. Active clients : 2.7 million, up 30% year-over-year (2.5 million last quarter) Q3 Net income : $9.5 million ($12.4 million in adjusted EBITDA) Following the announcement the stock has somewhat leveled off and settled at a bump of around 8%. Stitch Fix was widely considered a successful IPO last year, though it faced some challenges over the course of the front of the year. But as it’s expanded into new lines of subscriptions, its customer base still clearly continues to grow, and the company is still finding newer areas to expand — including the upcoming launch of Kids that it announced today. Like many recent IPOs, Wall Street is likely going to look for continued growth in terms of its core business (meaning, subscribers), but Stitch Fix is showing that it’s able to not set cash on fire as fresh IPOs sometimes do. “Our new Stitch Fix Kids offering is a testament to the scalability of our platform,” CEO and founder Katrina Lake said in a statement accompanying the release. “We’re excited for Stitch Fix to style everyone in the family and to create an effortless way for parents to shop for themselves and their children. Our goal is to provide unique, affordable kids clothing in a wide range of styles, giving our littlest clients the freedom to express themselves in clothing that they love and feel great wearing.” Stitch Fix’s new CMO, Deirdre Findlay, comes to the company from Google where she oversaw for the Google Home hardware products, which included Home and Chromecast.

Ashlee Clark-Thompson,"Whirlpool has a new finish for its large kitchen appliances called ""sunset bronze."" Chris Monroe/CNET A special corner of Whirlpool's enormous booth at CES 2018 was dedicated not just to the manufacturer's new partnerships with Amazon, Google and Apple, but to a new color for its large kitchen appliances. This spring, you can get new Whirlpool dishwashers, ranges, microwaves and refrigerators in a smudge-resistant finish called ""sunset bronze."" Existing color options include stainless steel and black stainless steel. The addition of a new color to Whirlpool's lineup shows a shift away from the ubiquitous stainless-steel finish that has become a must-have for many homeowners. And Sunset Bronze is definitely on trend; at first glance, the color is like a mix of copper and rose gold, a popular color that has made its way onto tech like iPhones and smart watches.

Hayley Peterson,"Major Sears suppliers including GE Appliances, Electrolux, Whirlpool, and Serta Simmons Bedding are demanding that the retailer immediately return their inventory of refrigerators, washers, dryers, mattresses, and other goods. The companies are demanding the return of inventory shipped to Sears and Kmart stores in the 45 days before Sears Holdings filed for bankruptcy, saying that Sears knew it was insolvent at the time of the shipments, according to court filings. Serta Simmons Bedding is asking for the return of $1.8 million in goods.

Rhett Jones,"As the dust settles on CES and all of the big gadgets have astounded or disappointed, its time for another round up of the little devices that werent notable enough to warrant their own coverage but still deserve plenty of love.
ZenPod
Its been about a year since the fidget spinner fad died off and in the meantime Apples AirPod wireless headphones have exploded in popularity. Why not combine both phenomenon into one unnecessary but useful product?
Air Vinyl Designs new AirPod case with built-in spinning capabilities is a must have for anyone who experiences high levels of anxiety about misplacing their expensive headphones. Rest assured that you have those headphones with you all the time as you fidget away your fears.
ZenPods are available for purchase now for $30.
Whirlpool Smart Countertop Oven
Whirlpool claims its first smart countertop oven can detect what kind of food youre cooking and heat it just right. It has 11 dynamic cooking modes and it comes with a camera inside that lets you monitor your food on a smartphone app. And yes, it has built-in integration with Alexa and Google Assistant.
With a retail price of $799, its a little cheaper than the Brava and a little more expensive than the June. If youre interested in purchasing Whirlpools latest appliance, pre-orders are already open but be warned that its limited to an edition of 2,000 units.
Anker Nebula Capsule II
Ankers soda can-sized Nebula Capsule projector/Bluetooth speaker combo is a pretty well-regarded all-in-one entertainment solution. The Android TV-powered device is now getting a sequel that adds 780p resolution thats supposed to be 100 percent brighter, a more powerful speaker, and auto-focus.
The new pico projector should be on shelves by the summer but unfortunately, youve already missed out on the early-bird pricing. Kickstarter donors could grab the Nebula Capsule II for $349, but it will retail for $599. Pre-orders launched on Ankers site but it looks like the page is down, at the moment.
Jammy
The Jammy travel guitar is a portable instrument that breaks down into four pieces. When disassembled its only 17-inches long and easily packs away in your luggage. Its a legitimate steel string guitar and midi-controller with a pretty decent sound. When its pieces come together, it can plug into an amp or headphones. It even has a variety of onboard effects and the app includes a metronome.
Shipments are expected to begin this month and its currently $399 to pre-order. That limited-time special knocks $200 off of the suggested retail price.
Nuraloop earphones
Nura is expanding its line of specialized headphones and making its personal-tuning tech available to a wider audience. The Australian startup plans to drop its first set of earbuds to half the price of the Nuraphones that garnered strong reviews.
Nuras standout feature is software that tests your hearing through an app and gradually learns how to be perfectly-tuned for your ears. The Nuraloops are wireless earbuds with all day battery life, water-resistance, and an optional headphone cable.
We dont have an exact price yet, but they should go for around $200.
D Free
Look, were not usually big fans of invasive smart devices that track your personal biological details and do who-knows-what with the information. But D Free could be a godsend for many people.
The device attaches to a users belly with medical tape and uses ultra-sound to monitors the content of their bladder. A smartphone app notifies the user of how full their bladder is on a scale of 1-10. This is designed for elderly users and people with bladder problems who might not get the message that its time to go when its truly time to go.
You can purchase the D Free for $500 or rent it for $40 per month. A steep cost but a small price to pay for peace of mind.
Yoolox wireless charger with suction cups
Yooloxs wireless portable phone charger isnt the fastest charging option but it has one thing that others dont: Its solved the problem of wireless charging on the go. While a traditional portable charger keeps your phone connected to the battery pack with a traditional cable, wireless chargers slide around and disconnect in your pocket. Yoolox added suction cups for a simple but functional solution that it claims can easily hold the weight of an iPhone X. Its a niche item, but neat.
Lenovo 700 Ultraportable Bluetooth Speaker
At 11 millimeters, Lenovos latest Bluetooth speaker is super thin and promises big sound. It has five manual controls on the face, is splash proof, and can take phone calls. As far as Bluetooth speakers go, this a luxury item. Itll set you back $150 when it drops in April.
Otter + Pop phone case
Another item for the you-know-who-you-are crowd. For the ultra-paranoid smartphone user, theres now a case that combines OtterBoxs legendary protection with PopSockets convenient little customizable handle.
Personally, Ive never had a use for the PopSocket but the biggest thing that bothered me about it was the idea of this big knob hanging off of my beautiful iPhone. The Otter + Pop solves this problem with a more ergonomic design that makes the PopSocket sit flush with the case when its retracted.
Its expected to be released in the spring for $60 and will only be available for the iPhone, at least for now.
Heatworks Duo Carafe Kettle
It seems this is the only product on our list that isnt guaranteed to exist but its still worth sharing. Heatworks says its patented Ohmic Array Technology uses electrical conduction to instantly heat water to your desired temperature.
The Duo Carafe Kettle is battery powered and looks a lot like a Britta filterin fact, it also filters your water. But most importantly, it promises to make a perfect cup of tea or ramen noodles in seconds.
Sadly, we have no release date or price for this one, but well be eager to try it when we do.","As the dust settles on CES and all of the big gadgets have astounded or disappointed, it’s time for another round up of the little devices that weren’t notable enough to warrant their own coverage but still deserve plenty of love.

Brian Bennett,"GM Frigidaire's Imperial line of refrigerators came in fun colors like pink and teal. Hepcat Haven There was a time when refrigerators, stoves, even washers and dryers had real pizzazz. That era was the late 1950s through the 1960s. These machines came in eye-popping colors and cut sharp, elegant silhouettes in the home. They conveyed a sense of permanence, pride and optimism in construction rivaling that of classic autos. Sadly, times have changed. Go to any large appliance showroom now, and you'll find a sea of forgettable stainless steel. This shift to featureless, industrial design happened at the turn of the millennium, as a rejection of the drab earth tones of the 1970s and the washed-out pastels, beige hues and cheap plastics of the 1980s and 1990s. Today's stark designs have gone way too far away from the colorful, creative designs of mid-century appliances. Antiseptic and anonymous, contemporary appliances play an industrial game of copycat. Frankly, I'm sick of it. Appliance makers should wipe the slate clean and return to their roots. Here are five qualities from midcentury appliances that modern manufacturers should adopt for their new products: Color was a big part of Frigidaire's appliance design in the 1960s. Found in Mom's basement Interesting colors Once upon a time, bright colors ruled home-appliance designs, thanks in large part to the influence of the auto industry. During the 1960s, numerous appliance brands were owned by car companies. That meant that the same finishes being used on the vibrant cars of the day were also available for your kitchen and laundry appliances. For example, GM, which owned Frigidaire from 1919 to 1979, introduced appliances in the 1960s in vibrant shades of red, blue, green and yellow. Some Frigidaire fridges, stoves and dishwashers even sported jazzy shades of teal or pink. RCA Whirlpool also made appliances in many wild colors and shades. Whirlpool Digital Library Whirlpool (then RCA Whirlpool) didn't fear a large color palette, either. It offered washing machines, dishwashers and refrigerators in yellows and pinks. Whirlpool even sold appliances in versions with brown exteriors, if that was your thing. These days, major appliance makers have lost their taste for interesting hues. Much of that shift is likely due to men cooking in greater numbers. I'm sure the rise of the celebrity chef in popular culture has role in this, too. The home kitchen in many respects has become a second man cave or an echo of a professional kitchen. Appliance companies have certainly embraced this perspective. From high-end brands like Wolf and Thermador to GE and more household names like KitchenAid and Samsung, all have ""chef-inspired"" or ""professional"" product lines. The end result is that stainless steel has become the non-color of choice. Darker, more smudge-resistant finishes like slate and black stainless steel have become an option across several brands, but these are just jazzed-up blacks and grays. Fortunately, we've seen some exceptions to these sober finishes in modern appliances. Whirlpool will soon offer a new finish it calls "" sunset bronze "" that's a cross between copper and rose gold; the hue is similar to what you find on iPhones and smart watches. And boutique and luxury manufacturers such as Big Chill and Smeg are already on this track with a rainbow of colors for their appliances. However, the status quo won't change until large players and consumers alike see the light and abandon stainless steel as the must-have appliance finish. Whirlpool's new ""sunset bronze"" appliance finish. Chris Monroe/CNET The feel of durability Large appliances of this era were big, heavy brutes. They used comparatively more metal in their construction and heavier parts than today's machines. The upside was that they exuded an air of permanence and durability. Whether or not older appliances really had more longevity than today's products is open for debate, but they certainly felt like they could take a beating. The LG DLEY 1701V dryer is both sturdy and beautiful. Chris Monroe/CNET I remember slamming old dryer and washer doors shut forcefully when I was a kid, and I never had any fear of causing damage. That's not the case with many new laundry models. The lighter weight metal or plastic parts of their doors make me think twice before I give it a hearty slam. Some appliances aren't even equipped for you to open and close them like you'd expect. Case in point: the LG DLEX 5000 dryer. Its door bounces right back from its latch if swung with any speed. In LG's defense, the company's LG DLEY 1701V dryer is the most beautiful contemporary laundry machine I've laid eyes on. With plenty of glass and steel, this appliance does feel like it's made to last. And yes, I could slam its door shut to my heart's content. Too bad the dryer's design is a rare outlier in the category. Loads of artistry Midcentury appliances tended to be sculpted in hard lines and with smooth, flat surfaces. Colors weren't one-dimensional, though; they were shaded in areas to create the illusion of depth. They were also trimmed with silver or polished steel edges that naturally drew the eye. Brand names were drawn in elegant cursive script and punctuated by stylized accents. The elegant logos and cursive labels on the GM Frigidaire Flair electric range and oven. Bradley Avery/bradavery.com These appliances had an artist's touch. In truth, they were domestic machines inspired by the daring and excitement of the jet, and later the space ages. You just don't see this flair in today's appliances. An example of the clock and cooking timers on a GM Frigidaire Flair. The half-hidden dials underneath the clock give the entire panel a strong aviation theme. Bradley Avery/bradavery.com For example, Frigidaire's Imperial family of appliances were especially distinctive and minimally modern. Though created for model year 1965, the products below all resonate with tasteful visual impact ahead of their time. The 1965 lineup of GM Frigidaire Imperial appliances was quite eye-catching. www.paintref.com Innovative design In terms of new features, capabilities and innovative applications, midcentury appliances were on point. Take the 1964 GE Americana refrigerator. It had a unique shape that would have fit right in on the set of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Two doors sit on top that vertically split its fridge compartment. Below is a bottom freezer unit. But what really draws the eye is a flat countertop in between the sections. It runs the entire width of the appliance and provides additional counter space. The 1964 GE Americana was sleek, functional, and had an interesting shape. Retro Renovation There's even recessed lighting above the counter, plus an AC outlet on its back edge. With the same shape and updated technology, I'd bet a fridge like this would be a hit today. Imagine LEDs instead of fluorescent bulbs, banks of AC options including USB and wireless charging. Of course, to gain a counter you do have to sacrifice something. That trade-off comes in the form of less cold storage space. That's not to say appliance companies haven't released groundbreaking approaches to a decades-old product category. Samsung's Family Hub fridges merge tech like cameras, touchscreens and apps with contemporary luxury styling. Besides its fancy display and smart functions, the Family Hub's design is updated, too. Its front is split into four independent doors, a departure from traditional two-door side-by-side and bottom freezer models. Still, this fridge is quite unique compared with the rest of the appliance market. Samsung's Family Hub fridge line uniquely offer updated designs and smart technology. Chris Monroe/CNET Optimism and then some Perhaps the most important ingredient of these older appliances is also the hardest one to define: optimism. To my mind, it radiates from these contraptions in waves. Both the Frigidaire Flair and GM Americana are examples of this fearless optimistic outlook. Designers dared to entirely re-imagine traditional concepts of the range, the oven, and the refrigerator. So what if a stove has never had burners that retracted to save space. An oven with gull-wing doors -- no problem. A fridge with a counter in the middle -- we can do that. This optimism stemmed from confidence in better tomorrows, the firm belief that the current model year is the best there ever was, and that the next year's would top that, too. Companies had the confidence to create appliances in colors spanning from the friendly and upbeat to the downright brash. Today, the rationale for conservative silver-and-black metal finishes is prudence and practicality. It also reflects the sober functionality of restaurant kitchens. Now the most forward-looking fridge design belongs to the Samsung Family Hub line. Its smart connected features are certainly impressive. I'd argue that physically, it doesn't deviate far from classic refrigerators. There was a carefree quality to these products, too. And why not think out of the box? Heck, in 10 years, you could be living on the moon, or Mars, so why worry? I admit it sounds like an infectious mindset. It's a bug I hope current appliance designers and consumers will catch again.

Ara Wagoner,"Smart displays were practically made for the kitchen, but the current offerings from Google, JBL, and Lenovo aren't made for the spills, stains, and smudges of a family's high-traffic, high-risk kitchen. There's no need to cry over spilled milk if it just drips on the floor, but if you spill it on a $300 smart display and fry it, I'd let slip a few tears. Nobody knows how chaotic a kitchen can be more than Whirlpool, and its KitchenAid Smart Display announced today at CES might be the best stab at a smart display that can survive the dangers of your kitchen.
The KitchenAid Smart Display is a 10-inch Google Assistant smart display that is IPX5 — ""for resistance to faucet water"" — and ready to help you control your smart home while you cook up something new with guided recipes, or entertain yourself with some Hulu episodes while you cook up your family's famous five-alarm chili for the church potluck. Google Assistant already has some pretty robust cooking skills for smart displays, but KitchenAid has partnered with Yummly to take the cooking experience to the next level.
Recipe resource and cooking planner Yummly has already shared recipes through Google Assistant for a while now, but Whirlpool — who acquired Yummly in 2017 — is launching a new Yummly Pro service that aims to bring Yummly's easy recipes and cooking help to Whirlpool's connected kitchen line, including the new KitchenAid Smart Display. These features include e-learning courses to help teach cooks new techniques at every skill level and special video ""Guided Recipes"" that will take you through the cooking process step by step visually, allowing you to see the way pros do it so you can attack new dishes with confidence.
KitchenAid told CNET that the KitchenAid Smart Display will run between $200 and $300 when it goes on sale in the second half of the year — sorry, guys, you'll have to find another gift for Mother's Day — but that's a lot of time for interest to pop and deflate like a souffle.

Jonathan Shieber,"The robot laundry folding wars are heating up. The German appliance manufacturing giant BSH is in the early stages of partnering with Israeli laundry folding robot designer Foldimate on product development and manufacturing in the latest volley in the battle to bring a commercially viable laundry folding robot to market. As technology moves inexorably closer to an episode of the Jetsons ( flying cars are already on the horizon ), it’s only fitting that laundry folding robots become the next step on the path. Foldimate took CES by storm last year with its early prototype for a laundry folding robot, and the company will be back again this year to unveil its new device and to speak more fully about what the partnership with BSH will entail. “We have come a long way since then,” Foldimate’s chief executive, Gal Rozov says of his company’s progress since that CES 2017 debut. The company has over 200,000 followers waiting for the opportunity to pre-order the laundry folding robotic device and is looking forward to the unveiling of a new and improved Foldimate. These two partners aren’t the only players in the laundry folding robot game. Seven Dreamers is working with Panasonic on the laundroid — which aims to bring its own vision of a laundry folding machine to the masses. Backed by roughly $90 million in capital from funds affiliated with the Henry Kravis and George Roberts, two of the founders of the gargantuan private equity investment firm KKR, laundroid is clearly the better funded device — but the partnership with BSH will go a long way toward leveling the playing field. There’s also a significant price difference between the two devices. Foldimate was aiming for a price point of around $850 as of last May, while laundroid is already retailing at $14,000 in Japan and has a targeted price of $2000. For Rozov, Fodlimate is the culmination of a seven-year journey for the software developer turned company founder. The rationale behind Foldimate is simple. Rozov hated folding clothes… but still wanted to help out around the house. Foldimate has already raised $3 million from undisclosed angel investors, but is counting on the partnership with BSH to take its business to the next level. “We believe we’ve gotten to a point where the technology is mature enough and we’re satisfied enough with the results,” to begin bringing the product to market, says Rozov. BSH will help with that process. “The best way to reduce risk with making such an endeavor with all of our challenging deadlines would be to have a partner,” Rozov tells me. “So we have decided to go deeper into discussions with BSH.” From its headquarters in Munich, BSH has become the second largest appliance manufacturing in the world (behind Whirlpool). “We have a big expertise in washing machines, dryers and garment care,” says Fridolin Weindl, head of crisis communication and International coordination bei BSH Home Appliances Group. “Foldimate has shown very innovative thinking and development of laundry folding solutions and this of course was interesting to us.” If everything goes well, Rozov said that Foldimate will look to go to market alongside BSH. These devices are already a hit with consumers who hear about them (all of my friends… and friends’ parents… want them), and move us further along the path to Rosey The Robot’s automated housekeeping services. Here’re some teaser images for the new Foldimate to tide you over til CES.",The robot laundry folding wars are heating up.

,"If you ever need to empty a bottle of its liquid (Perhaps you’re cleaning the bottle or making a huge amount of sangria!) then there is a trick to do it quickly. The video below demonstrates how. To understand the trick, let’s first look at why the simple way of simply turning the bottle up-side-down is so slow. As the water pours out of the bottle, the space left inside the bottle becomes larger. The air outside can’t come in to fill the space since the neck of the bottle is ‘clogged’ with the outpouring water. This leads to a pressure differential between the atmospheric pressure outside and the thinning pressure inside the bottle. Eventually, the pressure differential becomes so great that the atmosphere outside pushes the water back into the bottle, the air rushes in and the pressure is momentarily equalized. This is the ‘gulp’ that occurs. But this gulping takes time. Your precious time! Now let’s look at the clever fast way. By creating a whirlpool inside the bottle, you’ve set up a corridor of air connecting the inside of the bottle with the outside air. The water flows out of the bottle at the same time as the air flows in. There is never any difference in pressure and therefore no time-wasting gulping. That in turn gives you more Sangria time! Cheers!",A trick for emptying a bottle very quickly by creating a whirlpool inside the bottle.

CHRISTOPHER PAYNE and SAM ANDERSON,"Over the past few years, the photographer Christopher Payne visited the factory dozens of times, documenting every phase of the manufacturing process. His photographs capture the many different worlds hidden inside the complex’s plain brick exterior. The basement, where workers process charcoal, is a universe of absolute gray: gray shirts, gray hands, gray machines swallowing gray ingredients. A surprising amount of the work is done manually; it can take employees multiple days off to get their hands fully clean. Pencil cores emerge from the machines like fresh pasta, smooth and wet, ready to be cut into different lengths and dried before going into their wooden shells. Other parts of the factory are eruptions of color. Red pencils wait, in orderly grids, to be dipped into bright blue paint. A worker named Maria matches the color of her shirt and nail polish to the shade of the pastel cores being manufactured each week. One of the company’s signature products, white pastels, have to be made in a dedicated machine, separated from every other color. At the tipping machine, a whirlpool of pink erasers twists, supervised patiently by a woman wearing a bindi. Payne conveys the incidental beauty of functional machines: strange architectures of chains, conveyor belts, glue pots, metal discs and gears thick with generations of grease. He captures the strangeness of seeing a tool as simple as a pencil disassembled into its even simpler component parts. He shows us the aesthetic magic of scale. Heaps of pencil cores wait piled against a concrete wall, like an arsenal of gray spaghetti. Hundreds of pencils sit stacked in honeycomb towers. Wood shavings fly as fresh pencils are dragged across the sharpening machine, a wheel of fast-spinning sandpaper. In an era of infinite screens, the humble pencil feels revolutionarily direct: It does exactly what it does, when it does it, right in front of you. Pencils eschew digital jujitsu. They are pure analog, absolute presence. They help to rescue us from oblivion. Think of how many of our finest motions disappear, untracked — how many eye blinks and toe twitches and secret glances vanish into nothing. And yet when you hold a pencil, your quietest little hand-dances are mapped exactly, from the loops and slashes to the final dot at the very end of a sentence.

GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO,"The groups 2015 release, Time River, was both grandiose and immediately rewarding, guided by melody. On Under the Same Moon, featuring a cameo from the famed arranger Gil Goldstein on accordion, m_units rich corps of horns returns repeatedly to a lovely, whirlpool phrase, spinning it into your memory. The ensembles second album, the equally riveting Dancer in Nowhere, is due in February.
Since 2014, Ms. Hazama has curated the Jazz Composers Showcase at the Jazz Gallery, an intermittent series where rising composers take turns conducting the same group of musicians on a single night. While born of economic necessity, the cooperative model allows composers to meet other composers, Ms. Hazama said. You share the same big band but each composer has their own colors, and its fascinating to hear how different they are.
Through gatherings like these, the citys collection of young big-band composers has started to resemble a community of its own. Collaborative outfits like that of Ms. Seguine and Ms. Baker are becoming more common, with composing and organizing duties split between two bandleaders. The bassist Edward Perez and the saxophonist Michael Thomas co-run the Terraza Big Band, which plays monthly at Terraza 7 in Queens one of the few jazz clubs to host an emerging big band on a regular basis. And the saxophonists Anna Webber and Angela Morris colead a jagged-edged band that has begun to turn musicians heads.
Once you realize what a huge challenge it is to make those projects happen, you become really dedicated to helping other people, said Brian Krock, an alto saxophonist and bandleader who this year released a strong debut album (produced by Mr. Argue) introducing Big Heart Machine, his 18-piece ensemble. It plays muscly, warped original music, informed by metal, serialism and the jazz avant-garde, as well as more classic big-band influences like Bob Brookmeyer.
The big-bands boom looks like the latest example of jazzs academic-industrial complex, and of an emerging professional class of overeducated musicians with nowhere to play. Most of New Yorks new big bands are run by 20- and 30-somethings who recently graduated from a conservatory or a liberal-arts music program; like most such musicians, they will eventually find careers as teachers. But the music itself continues to break new ground.","Long seen as a vestige of jazz’s past, large ensembles are charging back, led by a new generation of musicians who see size as an opportunity, not a hindrance.",2018-12-31T19:22:33Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Critic’s Notebook: ‘They’re Doing It Out of Love’: The Big Band Rises Again,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/arts/music/jazz-big-band-revival.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/arts/03jazzessay1/01jazzessay1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,whirlpool,1

Thanos is the big bad wolf of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU for short) and he has been a shadowy presence in the Marvel films for a long time, having already popped up in the post-credits scene for the first Avengers film.

ALEXANDER BURNS,"The speaking contract for Mr. Bidens October appearance in Michigan suggests that the popular Democrat would have known he was addressing a Republican-leaning crowd. The speaking series was underwritten in part by organizations connected to Mr. Uptons family: Among the biggest sponsors listed on the Economic Clubs website are the Whirlpool Corporation, which was co-founded by Mr. Uptons grandfather, and the Frederick S. Upton Foundation, a family charity named for the same man.
The contract for Mr. Bidens visit shows he was paid $200,000 for his appearance, including a $150,000 speaking fee and a $50,000 travel allowance. It also specifies that the audience would be primarily older, conservative Republicans and local community members. The document was disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information request made by America Rising, a Republican group that conducts research on Democratic candidates.
It is unclear whether the fees Mr. Biden received in this case are standard for all his speeches. Mr. Bidens aides have declined to confirm what his rates are for paid appearances, including the appearance in Michigan, or how much he has earned through paid speaking since leaving office. In at least one instance, his speaking bureau, Creative Artists Agency, offered a reduced rate of $100,000, plus travel expenses, to the University of Utah.
If Mr. Biden were to have charged a similar range of fees for all his comparable speeches since leaving office, he would most likely have collected between $4 million and $5 million through speeches over the last two years.
Representatives of Lake Michigan College, which recently took over management of the Economic Club speaker series, and the Fredrick S. Upton Foundation confirmed that the Upton organization was a major sponsor of the series. Both organizations said Mr. Upton had no role in proposing or choosing the speakers. Lisa Cripps-Downey, president of the Berrien Community Foundation, a nonprofit that administers the Frederick S. Upton Foundation, confirmed that the organization had given substantial funding to the Economic Club, with an annual grant of $80,000 over the last three years a total close to a quarter-million dollars.
When we see the speakers, were just as surprised as everybody else, Ms. Cripps-Downey said.
Mr. Russo said Mr. Bidens team had been aware that the Frederick S. Upton Foundation helped fund the Economic Club. He said Biden aides had vetted the funding sources for the speaking series and concluded they met his standards.
Mr. Upton, who confirmed in a statement that he attended Mr. Bidens speech at Lake Michigan College, said he had no idea that Mr. Biden would refer to him at all, let alone so favorably. The two men ran into each other briefly at the venue, before Mr. Bidens speech, and they agreed to follow up to discuss the medical-research laws implementation, an aide to Mr. Upton said.",Joseph R.

LG has upgraded the smarts of its appliances in time for the Kitchen and Bath Industry Showcase (KBIS) in Las Vegas next week. You can now sync all of LG's smart washers, dryers and dishwashers from 2018 and 2019 to Amazon Dash. LG announced the upgrade on Thursday, which lets your smart appliance track and reorder detergent or dryer sheets automatically as they run low. 
To take advantage of the new feature, you'll need to sync your LG appliance to your Amazon Dash account. Amazon will let you specify your preferences as far as the brand and size of detergent or laundry supply you'd like to order. Your LG appliance tracks your usage through the LG ThinQ app, so it'll know when you start to run out. The ThinQ app will then tell Amazon Dash to order more and Amazon will deliver the ordered supplies to your door.
Again, the upgrade applies to all Wi-Fi-enabled LG dishwashers, washers and dryers from 2018 and 2019. LG isn't exactly breaking new ground here. Whirlpool and GE appliances have worked with Amazon Dash for years. Still, it's a handy upgrade if you like Amazon Dash and already own an LG appliance.",LG's recent smart appliances can reorder detergent for you.,2019-02-14T14:00:02Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",LG pairs washers and dishwashers with Amazon Dash ahead of KBIS - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/lg-pairs-washers-and-dishwashers-with-amazon-dash-ahead-of-kbis/,https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/96Z552Uemgk8jOugurXy3lMu5rk=/724x407/2018/01/08/fd8af9dc-1f90-48b0-ac3d-0172bcb34ef7/lg-twin-wash-pedestal-ces-2018-product-photos-1.jpg,,Cnet.com,whirlpool,1
Tonya Garcia,"Whirlpool Corp. has a list of reasons why its second-quarter earnings and revenue missed expectations, including trucker strikes in Latin America and U.S. tariff headwinds. “In addition to raw material inflation, we experienced a temporary but significant decline in U.S. industry demand, headwinds related to the U.S. tariffs as well as the Brazilian strike in Latin America,” said Chief Executive Marc Bitzer on the early Tuesday conference call, according to a FactSet transcript. Whirlpool WHR, -13.32% reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.20, below the $3.69 per share FactSet consensus. Revenue of $5.14 billion was also below the FactSet consensus for $5.29 billion. Shares have sunk 13.6% in Tuesday trading, putting it on track for the lowest close since January 2016, and the largest percent decrease since October 2011. Read: Tariffs are ‘the greatest,’ president says ahead of EU chief’s visit “Sales were impacted by weaker-than-expected industry demand in the U.S., slow progress on volume recovery in Europe and the Brazilian trucker strike,” Bitzer said. About 300,000 units were impacted by the trucker strike, with an earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) impact of $20 million. Weak local demand contributed $10 million to the EBIT decline, according to Chief Financial Officer James Peters. Things had been looking up for Whirlpool in the U.S. earlier this year. In January, the company announced that it hired 200 full-time workers in Ohio, anticipating increased demand. And President Trump announced tariffs on imported washing machines and washing machine parts. “[I]t is too early to quantify the financial impact on 2018,” Bitzer said on the January earnings call, according to FactSet, “but this is without any doubt a positive catalyst for Whirlpool.” Bitzer also highlighted “rising freight costs, primarily in the U.S. and Brazil due to oil inflation and fleet shortages as well as the conversion impact of short-term volume weakness in multiple regions.” Raw material inflation is blamed for a 125-basis-point margin impact. Before that, the U.S. International Trade Commission had determined that domestic washing machine companies were under threat from imported machines. The decision came after Whirlpool filed a petition to stop Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, -0.75% and LG Electronics Inc. 066570, +3.32% from flooding the market. Also: Google is a great investor, and Alphabet earnings are showing the results “[U]ncertainty related to tariffs and global trade actions have also led to increased costs for certain strategic components and finished goods imports and exports,” Bitzer said. Challenges in Europe include execution issues and shifts in the macroeconomic environment. Volume weakness in Europe is expected to offset a strong global price mix, according to Bitzer, resulting in flat revenue for the full year. Revenue for 2017 was $21.25 billion. The FactSet consensus is for revenue of $21.39 billion in 2018. Whirlpool is guiding for EPS of 15 cents to 75 cents, and adjusted EPS of $14.20 to $14.80. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of $15.51. Still, Bitzer found a few silver linings. “[T]he actions we put in place over the past few quarters, including cost base price increases and targeted cost reductions throughout the world enabled us to largely offset these challenges and expand ongoing EBIT margins year-over-year,” he said.

Lulu Chang,"Boiling water for a cup of tea shouldn’t be a hazard to your health, which is why Whirlpool has decided to recall over 40,000 KitchenAid electric kettles. The handle on the recalled models can reportedly loosen and separate from the rest of the kettle, which results in hot water spilling out, potentially causing burns and other injuries. As per a recall notice, Whirlpool is encouraging customers to “immediately stop using the recalled kettles and contact Whirlpool for a free replacement.” In total, 79 the Consumer Product Safety Commission received 79 reports across the United States of handles coming away, resulting in three reports of minor burn injuries. The problematic models were sold between September 2013 and February of this year at various home improvement retailers throughout the U.S. If you visited a Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond, or a Target, or even shopped on Amazon, you likely saw one of these KitchenAid electric kettles. Price tags stood somewhere between $100 and $120, and folks could choose among stainless steel, red, black, white, liquid graphite, and cocoa silver color variants. As Good Housekeeping reported, while the recall was only issued late last month, it would appear that folks on Amazon have been warning others about the dangers associated with the product for quite a few years. In 2014, for example, one customer noted, “The handle was slightly loose at the bottom, right out of the box. As I used it, the bottom part of the handle was clearly starting to detach from the body. Very disappointing. It would seem that Kitchen aide is cutting corners.” More recently, another wrote in 2017, “After 6 months of use, the handle broke off after I boiled a full pot of water. I could have been badly hurt. The handle just detached off the body without prior indication it was starting to break. I could have been burned so badly. It literally just happened. The lid detached too.” In order to determine whether or not your KitchenAid kettle is one that may pose a risk, check to see if your model and serial number is on the list posted on Whirlpool’s website. You can find these numbers on the bottom of your kettle. If you discover that your unit is indeed dangerous, contact Whirlpool for a free replacement either by calling 800-874-0608 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET Monday through Friday, or by visiting repair.whirlpool.com.","Boiling water for a cup of tea shouldn't be a hazard to your health, which is why Whirlpool has decided to recall over 40,000 KitchenAid electric kettles.

Joe Maring,"Meet your new cooking assistant. The different use cases for Alexa has grown substantially over the past couple years. The assistant works great for simple tasks like playing music and getting weather info, and using it for controlling smart lights and ordering an Uber never get old. Now, Amazon is planning Alexa's next great frontier – the kitchen. On the Amazon Alexa blog, it was recently announced that Alexa's Smart Home Skill API is gaining support for cooking features, starting first with microwave ovens. With these controls, users will be able to say things such as ""Alexa, microwave for 50 seconds on high"" and ""Alexa, defrost three pounds of chicken"" to keep on cooking without having to pound away at your microwave's keypad. Whirlpool will be the first to launch these new Alexa controls on its connected microwaves, with GE Appliances, Kenmore, LG, and Samsung also working on upgrading their microwaves and other appliances to be compatible as well. Although Amazon is starting off with microwaves, the end goal is to expand the functionality to other cooking devices, such as conventional ovens, at a later date. If you own an Amazon Alexa device, do you see yourself making use of these features as they're made available?","Meet your new cooking assistant.

Cherlynn Low,"To be clear, the AmazonBasics microwave doesn't have a built-in mic to hear your commands -- you link it to an Echo device like a Dot or a Plus. That sounds complicated, but Amazon's implemented something called WiFi simple setup. It uses your Amazon ID to connect to your home network so you don't have to reenter clunky passwords and you can connect everything via the Alexa app. Once you're done, you can get to the fun, hopefully yummy, part. I put some leftover lunch into the oven and asked Alexa to ""microwave one dinner plate,"" which is one of about 30 presets at launch. Normally, I'd put that in my microwave on high for about a minute and a half. Alexa set a timer for six minutes, though, which gave me a lot of anxiety about whether the food would blow up. I might have some PTSD. Thankfully, the microwave was able to manage its power, and I heard it humming on and off as the turntable spun. Because I don't usually sit around next to my microwave as it heats food up, I'm not certain if this is what they all do. However, I was impressed that the Amazon Microwave served up a perfectly warm plate of food that was heated through evenly. I had a similarly pleasant surprise with a cup of tea that had been sitting out. Since there isn't a preset for tea yet (my British colleagues aren't pleased about this), I had to ask Alexa to ""reheat a cup of coffee"" instead. Still, the result was a hot beverage that was warm enough to soothe my sore throat but not so hot it scalded me. I was definitely impressed, but really, all Alexa did was save me from having to think how long to heat my food up for. I do have a tendency to overheat my food, so... maybe this will save me from burning the roof of my mouth? There is something to be said for not having to do math yourself. Alexa can save you from trying to figure out how long to defrost 8 ounces of chicken for. Or you can just say ""cook 6 ounces of oatmeal"" and it'll figure out the time for you. The most common thing people cook in a microwave, though, is popcorn, and Amazon believes you'll be popping so much that there's a dedicated feature for ordering more. If you're a big popcorn eater, this is pretty useful (or dangerous). You start by telling the app how many bags of popcorn you have, and set how much you want to reorder when you run out. The Microwave keeps track of the bags of popcorn you've popped and automatically orders more when you run low. But it's basically just Amazon Dash. You can also manually reorder popcorn via the app or by asking Alexa. Speaking of, you don't have to say ""Alexa"" when you want to get the Assistant to listen -- you can also press the Ask Alexa button on the microwave itself. I don't really see the point of this button because if you can't SAY ""Alexa,"" you probably can't speak your next command. But hey, it's there in case you can't wait to finish chewing first or if your Echo is on mute because your roommate's name is Alexa. So far, Alexa's proved to be a capable chef and timer setter, but not much else. The company said more voice presets will be added over time, and there are about 30 now, so Alexa in a microwave should get more useful. But I'm not sure the AmazonBasics oven is any more convenient than a regular microwave. But at just $60, the Amazon Microwave is much cheaper than Alexa-enabled options by GE, Whirlpool or Kenmore, which are at least twice the price. Plus, they're not much smarter. The AmazonBasics Microwave is basic, but it's an affordable way to introduce a connected appliance to your budding smart kitchen.","I don't know about you, but I have a love-hate relationship with my microwave.

Chris Matyszczyk,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. Kids sometimes don't want to go to school. Their reasons might vary from ""Don't want to"" to ""Don't feel like it."" Sometimes, though, it's because they're feeling ashamed or even being bullied. And sometimes, the reason is both blindingly simple and painful. The kids don't have clean clothes. It could be because their parents can't afford a washer and a dryer. It could be because they can't afford to fix their broken machines. It could also be because, as one little girl admitted: ""Our electricity got cut off."" In stepped Whirlpool to offer schools washers and dryers, so that kids could bring their washing into school and have it done there. Perhaps some parents and kids might find it embarrassing at first to admit that they need to have their clothes washed at school. Then again, perhaps the more parents that use the machines, the less embarrassing it is. It's not as if recent economic times have closed the gap between rich and poor, is it? Yes, for Whirlpool this is an ad. It's also something that school teachers are saying improves school attendance. The people who run the so-called Care Counts program say that in 90 percent of cases it improved attendance. At-risk kids attended school for two more weeks a year. Of course, some might feel it's a sad indictment of our social and educational systems that such a situation might have arisen. However, the program now seems to be expanding to more schools in more parts of the country. So many times, brands try to piggyback on social issues solely in order to make themselves look good. How often does an event occur that captures the public's imagination or grief and every brand on earth insists on tweeting its own take on the subject? In this case, it seems that Whirlpool actually bothered to consider what genuine good it could do for others. Which seems startlingly sane and refreshing.","This isn't an obvious solution, but it seems to be working.",2017-11-11T20:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}","This Famous Company Found an Ingenious, Emotionally Intelligent Way To Improve School Attendance",https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/how-whirlpool-found-an-emotionally-intelligent-way-to-improve-school-attendance.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_178082111_2000133320009280138_330171.jpg,,Inc.com,whirlpool,1
BeauHD,"PIRG poured over the documentation for 50 companies such as Bissell, Whirlpool, and Panasonic to document their warranty policies. When it couldn't find clear language about warranty and repair, it reached out to the companies via their customer service lines. The overwhelming majority of the companies told PIRG that independent repair would void the warranty. The 1975 Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act states that no manufacturer who charges more than $5 for a product can put repair restrictions on a product they're offering a warranty on. In May, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sent warning letters to Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, HTC, Hyundai, and ASUS for violating the act by threatening to void the warranties of customers who repaired their own devices. Within 30 days, many of the companies had complied and changed the language on their websites around independent repair. It was a step in the right direction, but the PIRGs survey of the AHAM members shows that there's still a lot of work to do.","U.S. PIRG -- a non-profit that uses grassroots methods to advocate for political change -- found that 90 percent of manufacturers it contacted claimed that a third party repair would void its warranty.

Tyler Lacoma,"When shopping around for your next fridge, one of the best first steps is to narrow down your choices to a brand or two that you want to focus on. But what brands are best? Which have the most useful designs, or the most impressive features? Which will last the longest with needing repairs or other work?
If these questions already make you feel a little stressed, don’t worry. We’re going to cover the top refrigerator brands to consider, why they’re worth a look, and a few standout models that show just what these manufacturers can dofrom built-in coffeemakers to Wi-Fi connectivity and voice assistants.
Whirlpool
Whirlpool refrigerators continue to get particularly high marks for their reliability and quality. Yale Appliance rates them as the best for reliability, which means Whirlpool fridges tend to get the least service calls out of all the top brands. Ranker voters also put Whirlpool at the top of their favorite fridge brands. Our top pick for the best refrigerators of 2019 is also a Whirlpool model, the excellent Whirlpool Double Drawer WRV986FDEM, which sports an immense amount of storage and many different types of storage compartments for various types of food.
So if you are looking for a dependable brand that will give you the space you need, Whirlpool is an easy recommendation. However, Whirlpool’s best models tend to be fairly low tech, so if you are looking for a fridge with few more interesting features, you may want to explore some of these other brands.
LG
Some of our favorite fridge models come from LG, too. As LG has invested in its refrigerator division, it has proven to be a skilled manufacturer with a focus on high-tech features and solid design. If you like stylish fridges that have impressive Wi-Fi smart screens that also double as a window into your fridge, then LG offers some of the most incredible models around. Some even come with built-in Keurig coffeemakers.
LG also has the best appliance dependability ratings behind Whirlpool, which means in addition to all that tech, you can also expect less repairs to your model. Finally, a couple LG models show up on Consumer Reports recommendations for kid-friendly fridges. No matter what kind of fridge you are looking for, check out similar LG models to see what they have to offer.
Samsung
Bill Roberson/Digital Trends
Samsung produces high-tech fridges known for their sleek stainless steel and Wi-Fi capabilities. If you want a refrigerator that really goes the extra mile with technology, this is a brand to check out. One of the prime examples is the Samsung Family Hub, a massive refrigerator with a large touch screen powered by Bixby, Samsung’s voice assistant, which is able to help you out with all kinds of daily tasks. The fridge also showcases other Samsung strengths, such as fingerprint resistant steel, customizable cooling settings for the freezer, and a versatile flex door. Smart screen refrigerators have a ways to go before they become a key part of the market, but the Family Hub shows just what is possible.
Like Whirlpool and LG, Samsung also has refrigerators with high appliance reliability, which means you may not need to arrange as many repairs as other brands. Of course, with all this technology, you may have to pay a high price for a connected Samsung fridge–the Family Hub costs around $3,600.
GE Appliances
The GE Profile Series PFE28PMKES made it to the top of our best French-door refrigerator list, with excellent features including Wi-Fi, a built-in coffeemaker, Alexa compatibility, and very versatile shelving that can be expanded as necessary to store larger items. There’s a reason that other publications such as Good Housekeeping also chooses such GE models as their top refrigerator picks: There’s a whole lot going on here, and something for everyone. Plus, you may find GE Appliances prices to be lower than some of the previous brands, an ideal feature if you would really like to save some money.
KitchenAid
KitchenAid is one of the best brand options if you are especially interested in more elaborate refrigerators with accommodations for everythingalong with the classic KitchenAid quality and experience. The brand offers 5-door models, dual-cooling systems for targeted temperature control, specialized herb storage, and other features that dedicated chefs will love (including those who have aspirations beyond amateur kitchen creations).
Viking
While Viking may not have been on your expected list of refrigerator brands, there are two very good reasons to consider Viking models. First, Viking has some of the best paneling options for refrigerator installations, which is ideal if you prefer beautiful paneling in your kitchen rather than the common stainless steel approach seen so often these days.
Second, Consumer Affairs collected consumer reviews of refrigerator brands scores Viking at 3-and-a-half stars, by far the highest ratingmost other refrigerator brands scored less than 2 stars, as people frequently complain about service issues or malfunctions. That Viking can maintain such a high score is a testament to their excellent customer service and quality.","Shopping for a new refrigerator?

This Samsung is our #2-rated refrigerator overall, and the top-rated affordable French door in our Best of Year awards. You’re not going to find a better fridge for less. Get the LG LFC21776ST counter depth fridge at Home Depot for $1398 Counter depth refrigerators tend to cost a little more than standard-depth models, but they take up less space in your kitchen and don’t stand out as far from your cabinets. We’ve tested many LG models similar to this fridge, and think this is an awesome deal on a sleek, affordable, counter-depth refrigerator. Get the Samsung RF28JBEDBSG top-freezer at Home Depot for $2098 If you’re looking for extra storage, this is one of our favorite refrigerators.

Best dishwasher deals The LG LDF5545ST dishwasher (Photo: LG Electronics) Get the Whirlpool WDF520PADM dishwasher at Home Depot for $298 Whirlpool dishwashers are good values—I have a similar model in my own home. Because it has a plastic tub this one might be a little louder than most newer dishwashers, but it’s certainly quieter than a decade-old model. At $298, you’re not going to find a better dishwasher for less. Get the LG LDF5545ST dishwasher at JC Penney for $495 Or, you could step up to the dishwasher that won our Best of Year award for value—a quiet LG with a modern look. It cleans really well, too! Get the KitchenAid KDTM354DSS dishwasher at Home Depot for $798 We love this KitchenAid dishwasher because of its unique water filtration system, which rinses your dishes with clean water without making a ton of noise. Ball bearings keep its racks sliding smoothly, too. In fact, it’s our top-ranked dishwasher that isn’t a Bosch (and Bosch dishwashers never go on sale like this). Best cooking appliance deals The Whirlpool WFE515S0ES electric range (Photo: Whirlpool Corp.) Get the Whirlpool WFE515S0ES range at AJ Madison for $444 This is one of the best-selling electric ranges in the U.S. In fact, I bought it for my own kitchen in 2015 and am still satisfied with it. Its stainless trim and sleek exterior blend in with almost any kitchen style, and both our lab tests and my years of ownership show that it bakes evenly and boils quickly. Get the Kenmore 74143 range at Sears for $499 This is the best deal we’ve ever seen on a gas convection range. While we haven’t tested this specific model, we do know that it is made for Kenmore by Frigidaire, and we’ve been impressed with their affordable ranges lately.

Kline, The Motley Fool","President Donald Trump told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that his administration is taking measures to promote security for American allies around the globe, saying ""America is roaring back,"" and now is the time to invest. (Jan. 26) AP Prices are likely going up, but the question is: When will they be going up? A new tariff could raise the price of washing machines. (Photo: Getty Images) President Donald Trump has approved a recommendation from the United States Trade Representative to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines and parts. The tariff decreases and then disappears after three years. The move came after a petition was filed by Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR), a U.S.-based washing machine manufacturer facing tough competition from LG Electronics and Samsung, both based in South Korea. Trump's actions are in line with his ""America first"" campaign pledge, but tariffs may not have the desired effect. The goal of the tariff is to level the playing field for the American company, which has been hurt by lower-priced imports. That's what Whirlpool alleged as it accused its two rivals of flooding the market with low-cost washing machines. Tariffs, however, can backfire for the American public as they can push prices higher. Is now the time to buy a washing machine? LG has already told retailers that it intends to raise prices, according to The Wall Street Journal. Any increase could have a major consumer impact as LG accounted for 18% of washing machines sold in the U.S. by dollars in the fourth quarter. LG's actions could cause a ripple effect in the industry. Samsung and Whirlpool could follow with increases of their own, but Chris Rogers, a data analyst at Panjiva, does not believe consumers need to immediately run out and buy a new washing machine. Rogers, whose company describes itself as ""a big data company that analyzes global supply chains,"" believes that prices will go up, just not immediately. ""The effect will increase the cost of a washing machine by an average of 10%, equaling about $90 per machine (based on an average price of $900-$1000, as seen on BestBuy.com),"" he wrote in an email interview with The Motley Fool. ""While this is significant, according to Panjiva data there was a record number of washing machine exports in December, meaning retailers are likely sitting on large inventories, which could result in their discounting of these machines in the near-term in an effort to move product quickly."" Rogers notes that LG's announced price hike, which some pundits think will be $50 per machine, suggests it is absorbing some of the tariff increase to help cut its stockpile. ""So, if you're thinking of buying a new machine within the year it's worth bumping up that timeline and making the investment in the next few months, but there's no need to go out today,"" he wrote. Is this good for consumers? The washing machine tariff is almost certain to push prices higher, which is bad for Americans looking to buy one. Whirlpool, however, might become more competitive with its foreign rivals and this could lead to good things for its workers. What remains to be seen is what the ripple effect of the tariffs will be (Trump also enacted a similar tariff on solar panels ). These moves could level the playing field for U.S. companies competing domestically, but they could also result in similar moves being made by other countries. There is widely accepted research that shows that tariffs often end up being an added tax on American consumers. That appears to be what's happening here as Whirlpool may sell some more washing machines, but Americans will pay more when they need to buy a new one (unless they hit the stores in the next few months). President Donald Trump says he's imposing new tariffs to ""protect American jobs"" and workers. Trump also said he's ""not concerned"" about what Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during an interview with Robert Mueller for his Russia probe. (Jan. 23) AP Daniel B.

Lulu Chang,"Whirlpool could soon be selling you a sous vide machine. Earlier this month, the home appliance maker was granted a patent for the cooking device, as per documents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The proposed sous vide cooker will be comprised of an induction cooktop, a cooking vessel, a wireless temperature probe, and a magnetic stirring plate. This seems to suggest that it will be much more involved than, say, a sous vide stick from Anova or Joule, and will instead be a countertop appliance or immersion circulator. Cooking sous vide, of course, allows professional chefs and home cooks alike to heat and maintain water to a precise temperature, which is then used to cook proteins and vegetables that have been sealed in plastic bags. This allows for careful monitoring of your ingredients’ doneness, which can be particularly useful when cooking delicate items like fish or steak. There are a number of other companies that have come forth with an induction cooktop offering, but Whirpool’s seems unique in that it has a cooking vessel held within another container, so that you don’t have to use your own pots and pans to go with the machine. Instead, it seems likely that all you’ll have to do is bag up your food items, set your desired water temperature, and let your ingredients go for a dip. For the time being, Whirlpool is staying quiet about its proposed innovation, and while the patent has been granted, it’s not necessarily the case that we’ll be seeing a sous vide machine anytime soon (or at all). That said, given the growing popularity of such devices and the cooking technique as a whole, it’s not surprising that Whirlpool is looking to get in the game. After all, the company already has some competition from other established names in the home appliance space. GE, for example, has created an electric slide-in stove that comes with an induction burner and Bluetooth-connected temperature probe so that you can create your own sous vide water bath on your own stovetop. We’ll keep you posted if and when Whirlpool officially releases its newest appliance.","Whirlpool could soon be selling you a sous vide machine.

Megan Wollerton,"Honeywell's smart thermostats will soon work with certain Whirlpool appliances. Chris Monroe/CNET Whirlpool today announced a partnership with thermostat maker Honeywell. Honeywell's line of smart thermostats will be integrated into a select number of smart Whirlpool appliances in 2018. In the official press release, Whirlpool said this integration would eventually reach over two dozen appliances. Whirlpool already offers a lineup of smart appliances, along with a related app and other smart functionality. Its Smart Cabrio washer already works with Nest's thermostats to track home and away status. For instance, if your Nest thermostat senses that you're away from home, your washer is supposed to kick into a slower, energy-saving mode. The integration with Honeywell should work similarly. If a Honeywell thermostat detects that you're not home, a paired Whirlpool appliance should also switch over to an away mode. Whirlpool also said its compatible appliances could delay cycles until your Honeywell thermostat detects that you're home. I'm not sure why I'd want my dishwasher to wait for me to be home to complete a cycle, but we'll try to track down some of these products at CES to learn more about how they work -- and why we'd want these integrations.

Andrew Webster,"For the past week or so, virtually all of my time has been dedicated to the sprawling Wild West epic Red Dead Redemption 2. Rockstar’s latest game is so huge, so all-encompassing, that I didn’t let myself play anything else while reviewing it. In 2018 that isn’t such an easy thing to do. So many of the games I play now are ones that have become fixtures in my daily routine. I feel like I’m missing out not checking in on my Animal Crossing campground, or getting in a few matches of Clash Royale. That sense of FOMO is particularly apparent in Fortnite. It changes so much, and so fast, that a prolonged absence can make it feel like you’re returning to a completely different game. When I last played Fortnite, the latest major addition was a vehicle that let you ram through walls and launch players in the air. That was 10 days ago — and so much has been added since. The major shift has been the Halloween “Fortnitemares” event, which has filled the island with shambling monsters. ( They’re definitely not zombies.) As you play you’ll come across purple, rocky outgrowths that spawn these creatures, until you destroy them. Fortnite has always been a game about killing other players, so this adds a completely new dynamic. It reminds me of Titanfall, where even terrible players — like me — could get in some kills by taking out computer-controlled enemies. It’s also really creepy, thanks in large part to the unsettling sound design, which reminds me a bit of the game’s limited-time Thanos event. Even before you can see the monsters, you definitely hear them. It fits perfectly with game’s sixth season, which has largely added a darker and more supernatural feel to Fortnite. Even more useful to casual Fortnite fans is a fundamental change to how the game is played: now when you fall from a tall structure or jump off a cliff, you can deploy your parachute whenever you want, in all game modes. It’s great for preventing accidental deaths or for players who are typically hesitant to build up high during fights. There are other changes, too, particularly with the game’s ever-evolving environmental storytelling. When I last left the game, the floating island — which is propped up by my beloved interdimensional cube — was slowly moving around the map, visiting particular spots that were home to cryptic runes burned into the ground. Now, though, the island has floated back to its starting point, and has shattered into multiple pieces, each of which still float in the air. There’s a big purple bolt of lightning that connects the island fragments to an unsettling whirlpool in the sky. Honestly, I have no idea what’s happening. It feels like I’ve missed out on something When you play Fortnite regularly, you’re able to take these kinds of changes in small doses, which makes them much easier to follow. It’s one of the best things about the game. The way it’s constantly evolving is its own kind of storytelling, one that’s particularly compelling if you keep a close eye on the game. But, as I’ve learned, it doesn’t take long to feel like you’re out of the loop. Now, to be fair, updates as big as “Fortnitemares” aren’t all that frequent. But that’s the thing about Fortnite : you never know what changes are coming, what they’ll be, and what kind of impact they’ll have on the overall game. (Just ask all of the competitive Fortnite players who are upset about these massive changes ahead of this weekend’s big TwitchCon tournament.) When a whole bunch of new things are added around the same time, it makes the game feel very different. After a few matches I’m catching up with what’s happened, but it does feel like I’ve missed out on something. I didn’t see how other players dealt with the monsters early on, and I wasn’t able to witness the floating island’s destruction as it happened. There’s clearly something big about to happen with the cube, though, with that strange bolt of purple lightning. And with Red Dead now complete, there’s no way I’m going to miss it.","All it takes is a week away from the battle royale game Fortnite to feel like you’re missing out on big changes, like the recent “fortnitemares” Halloween event.",2018-10-27T18:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",A week away from Fortnite feels like forever,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18029094/fortnite-fortnitemares-updates-hallowen-battle-royale,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_SM-2kALCvCSnx1E_v4j8_AkWc=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13340167/Fortnite_20181026133637.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,whirlpool,1
Natasha Lomas,"Amazon has confirmed it’s retired physical stick-on Dash buttons from sale — in favor of virtual alternatives that let Prime Members tap a digital button to reorder a staple product.
It also points to its Dash Replenishment service — which offers an API for device makers wanting to build Internet connected appliances that can automatically reorder the products they need to function — be it cat food, batteries or washing power — as another reason why physical Dash buttons, which launched back in 2015 (costing $5 a pop), are past their sell by date.
Amazon says “hundreds” of IoT devices capable of self-ordering on Amazon have been launched globally to date by brands including Beko, Epson, illy, Samsung and Whirlpool, to name a few.
So why press a physical button when a digital one will do? Or, indeed, why not do away with the need to push a button all and just let your gadgets rack up your grocery bill all by themselves while you get on with the importance business of consuming all the stuff they’re ordering?
You can see where Amazon wants to get to with its “so customers dont have to think at all about restocking” line. Consumption that entirely removes the consumer’s decision making process from the transactional loop is quite the capitalist wet dream. Though the company does need to be careful about consumer protection rules as it seeks to excise friction from the buying process.
The ecommerce behemoth also claims customers are “increasingly” using its Alexa voice assistant to reorder staples, such as via the Alexa Shopping voice shopping app (Amazon calls it ‘hands free shopping’) that lets people inform the machine about a purchase intent and it will suggest items to buy based on their Amazon order history.
Albeit, it offers no actual usage metrics for Alexa Shopping. So that’s meaningless PR.
A less flashy but perhaps more popular option than ‘hands free shopping’, which Amazon also says has contributed to making physical Dash buttons redundant, is its Subscribe &amp; Save program.
This “lets customers automatically receive their favourite items every month”, as Amazon puts it. It offers an added incentive of discounts that kick in if the user signs up to buy five or more products per month. But the mainstay of the sales pitch is convenience with Amazon touting time saved by subscribing to ‘essentials’ — and time saved from compiling boring shopping lists once again means more time to consume the stuff being bought on Amazon…
In a statement about retiring physical Dash buttons from global sale on February 28, Amazon also confirmed it will continue to support existing Dash owners — presumably until their buttons wear down to the bare circuit board from repeat use.
“Existing Dash Button customers can continue to use their Dash Button devices,” it writes. “We look forward to continuing support for our customers shopping needs, including growing our Dash Replenishment product line-up and expanding availability of virtual Dash Buttons.”
So farewell then clunky Dash buttons. Another physical push-button bites the dust. Though plastic-y Dash were quite unlike the classic iPhone home button — always seeming temporary and experimental rather than slick and coolly reassuring. Even so, the end of both buttons points to the need for tech businesses to tool up for the next wave of contextually savvy connected devices. More smarts, and more controllable smarts is key.
Amazon’s statement about ‘shifting focus’ for Dash does not mention potential legal risks around the buttons related to consumer rights challenges — but that’s another angle here.
In January a court in Germany ruled Dash buttons breached local ecommerce rules, following a challenge by a regional consumer watchdog that raised concerns about T&amp;Cs which allow Amazon to substitute a product of a higher price or even a different product entirely than what the consumer had originally selected. The watchdog argued consumers should be provided with more information about price and product before taking the order — and the judges agreed. Though Amazon said it would seek to appeal.
While it’s not clear whether or not that legal challenge contributed to Amazon’s decision to shutter Dash, it’s clear that virtual Dash buttons offer more opportunities for displaying additional information prior to a purchase than a screen-less physical Dash button. So are more easily adaptable to any tightening legal requirements across different markets.
The demise of the physical Dash was reported earlier by CNET.",Amazon has confirmed it’s retired physical stick-on Dash buttons from sale — in favor of virtual alternatives that let Prime Members tap a digital button to reorder a staple product.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Look up to the sky with the unaided eye and you’ll see lots of specks and globs that look mostly like stars. On closer inspection, though, some of those dots refuse to resolve, smeared out on the night sky. Famed astronomer Charles Messier noticed these objects while studying comets—indeed, they looked like comments standing still in the sky, according to NASA. He therefore called these imposters “objects to avoid,” and catalogued them in his list of 103 “Messier Objects.” That list has since been expanded to 110. It’s a good thing scientists didn’t avoid the imposters, though. It turned out to contain some incredibly important astronomical objects, smeared out because they consisted of not one, but many stars. The first comet-looking thing, M1, was the now often-studied Crab Nebula. His catalogue also included the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), the pinwheel galaxy often used as a Milky Way lookalike (M101) and the Whirlpool galaxy (M51a). You, too, can spot many of these objects with an amateur telescope. The Hubble Telescope has made spotting these objects simple, and has creating some breathtaking images along the way. That includes the Eagle Nebula, also called the Pillars of Creation or M16, perhaps the most famous nebula ever observed. Hubble has spotted 93 of these objects. They’re not true color, since Hubble takes single color images at a time. Usually, several observations at different wavelengths are combined, or colors are added during processing to squeeze out meaningful information. Hubble’s added another twelve new images—you can take a look below and browse the rest here. M58 M58 sits between the Virgo and Leo constellations, near the star arcturus. At 62 million light-years away, it’s the most distant object Messier spotted, according to NASA. It’s got a large ring inside where there’s lots of star formation going on. M59 Right next to M58 is M59, an enormous elliptical galaxy. It’s around 60 million light-years away, according to NASA, and its inner core rotates the opposite direction as the rest of the object. Astronomer Johann Gottfried Koehler first spotted it in 1779. It’s also proof that, well, not every galaxy is cool looking. M62 M62 is a globular cluster around 22,500 light-years away. Rather than a whole galaxy, it’s almost a miniature galaxy inside the Milky Way made up of at least 150,000 stars packed together. It has its own black hole and can be spotted near the star Antares, between the constellations Scorpius and Ophiuchus. M75 M75 is another globular cluster, located 67,500 light-years away to the west of Sagittarius. You can spot it with binoculars, but its stars are so closely packed that it looks like a star itself without a telescope. It, too, may contain its own black hole. M86 M86 is another elliptical (or lenticular) galaxy, located 52 million light-years away. It’s also located in the Virgo cluster, a selection of galaxies between Virgo and Leo. M88 M88 is a spiral galaxy also located in the Virgo cluster—as N ASA reports, Messier discovered it alongside eight other objects in 1781. It’s 47 million light-years away and has an active galactic nucleus, an extremely bright emission from its center. M89 M89 is a nearly perfectly circular elliptical galaxy in the Virgo cluster, 50 million light-years away. M90 M90 is another spiral galaxy in the Virgo cluster, 59 million light-years away. Scientists think it’s slowly turning into an lenticular galaxy, the halfway point between elliptical and spiral galaxies, as it ages. M95 M95 is a barred spiral galaxy located just below the constellation Leo. It’s full of younger, blue stars. M98 M98 is a spiral galaxy in the Virgo cluster located 44 million light-years away. M108, the “Surfboard Galaxy” M108 is located in the Big Dipper, 46 million light-years away. Messier’s friend Pierre Mechain discovered the object in 1781, but the object wasn’t added to the catalogue until 1953. The object looks like a barred spiral galaxy, but since we can only see it head on, it’s hard to tell whether it has spiral arms or not. M110 M110 is a satellite orbiting the nearby Andromeda Galaxy. It’s a small elliptical galaxy","Look up to the sky with the unaided eye and you’ll see lots of specks and globs that look mostly like stars.

"feedback@businessinsider.com (Peter Schiff), Peter Schiff","Chris Keane/Reuters President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum could lead to a broader trade war. In addition to increasing prices for American consumers, a trade war could threaten overseas demand for US Treasurys, complicating government efforts to borrow money. With his announcement last week of broad tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, President Trump launched what could be the first salvo of an all-out global trade war. Seemingly itching for a fight, he gleefully tweeted that ""Trade wars are good, and easy to win."" It seems like Trump thinks the conflict will play out much like Ronald Reagan's 1983 week-long invasion of Grenada rather than the more telling quagmires that unfolded in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. He's wrong. Apart from overestimating America's bargaining position, Trump and his supporters grossly misunderstand the nature of international trade and how Americans have benefited from a system that has allowed us to continually consume foreign goods on credit. While this ""benefit"" has also placed a cost on domestic industries, I don't believe that Trump has any idea how a trade war can reduce current American living standards. As justification for his surprise offensive, Trump likes to highlight how America's gargantuan annual trade deficit (which has grown to more than $600 billion during his presidency) is simply the yardstick by which ""stupid"" American trade policies are subsidizing foreign economies. In his mind tariffs are just a means to take back what we have foolishly given away. As Trump explained via Twitter "" When we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore - we win big."" But does a country with a trade deficit really subsidize the country with the surplus? Or is it the other way around? Let's suppose you keep chickens at home, and your neighbor has a cow. Everyday you trade a half dozen eggs for a quart of milk. This is the nature of trade. You offer something that you have in abundance (that other people don't) for something that someone else has in abundance (that you don't). But let's suppose you eat a few of your chickens and your egg production drops to four per day. You continue to get your quart of milk, but everyday your neighbor adds two eggs to the account that you owe. Theoretically, you will one day owe your neighbor a whole bunch of eggs. But, in the meantime, does that two-egg deficit represent a benefit to you or your neighbor? Remember your neighbor still has to deliver the same amount of milk for less of a current payoff. He MAY get that deferred compensation down the road, but he's not getting it now. And with every egg you go into the hole, the greater the chances that your neighbor may ultimately get stiffed. Who is likely to be worse off if this trade were to suddenly stop? Remember, you are not the only potential trading partner available to your neighbor. Maybe the house across the street will give him six eggs for his milk? The eggs/milk deficit that you have with your neighbor allows you to consume more than your production capacity would typically allow. While this is a definite benefit to you now, it does dissuade you from making the sacrifices necessary to increase your egg production. Your own industry atrophies while your neighbor's doesn't. But so what? You still get all the milk you need. The point of an economy is to maximize consumption. Since goods cannot be consumed that have not been produced, it goes without saying that production is a necessary precondition to consuming. But, if given the choice, most people would be happy to outsource the production to someone else and concentrate solely on the consumption. But in the real world such an arrangement is untenable over the long term. Of course your milk/eggs trade arrangement will be a problem if your neighbor cuts off your credit and demands full payment. Then you are stuck with a big debt, reduced egg production, and no milk. But, for America, that day has yet to come. For now, our trading partners are happy to take our debt rather than our goods. But if Trump starts making more unreasonable demands, they may not be so willing. It's helpful to remember that a tariff is essentially a tax that will be paid by domestic consumers. It's not like American producers will keep prices where they are and simply manufacture more steel to make up for the lost imports. Instead, prices will likely rise to almost the same level as the taxed imported products. Profits at American steel companies will increase, but production probably won't. The manufacturers will know that the artificial political barrier protecting them could be removed at any time. Will they take the risk in investing in plant and equipment capacity when they know that removal of the tariffs would instantly eliminate their advantages and expose them to losses? Given the thin support that such tariffs will have beyond the narrow steel industry, it's safe to assume that current manufacturers will stand pat and use the extra profits to issue dividends and buy back shares. To a lesser extent, they may increase wages for the nation's 140,000 steel workers. But this industry-specific benefit will come at a great cost to the overall economy. Raising the cost of steel would also raise the cost of every American product manufactured with steel. Right now the discussion is focused on beer cans, with people arguing about how many cents per soup can the tariffs will add. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. The real impact will be seen for metal-intensive items that are manufactured both here and abroad. While the Trump tariffs will directly raise the price of imported steel (and indirectly the price of domestic steel), it does nothing about the price of goods made FROM steel. So a domestic manufacturer of home appliances, such as Whirlpool, will have to pay more for steel used to make a refrigerator. But its foreign competitors will be able make refrigerators with untaxed steel and then ship the finished product to the U.S. without facing a tariff. This will give the foreign firm a competitive advantage over Whirlpool both at home and abroad. Whirlpool will shed profits and may shed workers. So whatever advantages are given to steel manufacturers will be paid for by companies and workers that use steel. The problem for Trump is that there are only 140,000 domestic workers in the steel-making industry, but more than six million workers in industries that make stuff FROM steel. (American Iron &amp; Steel Institute) Trump's gambit is also politically ham-fisted. He likes to say that his tariffs are aimed at bad actors like China. But that country is far down the list of steel exporters to America. The move really hits our close allies first, particularly Canada, a country that accounts for 16% of our steel imports, according to a December 2017 report from the Dept. of Commerce. But 50% of U.S. steel exports GO to Canada. Total cross-border trade between the U.S. and Canada in 2016 came in at more than $600 billion annually, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. That's a very big applecart to push over for a comparatively small gain. Potentially even more dangerous is the way the tariffs will be implemented. By absurdly claiming that they are being done in the interest of ""national security"" rather than economic advantage, the Trump administration is inviting embarrassing losses at the World Trade Organization, which combined with a rapidly deteriorating diplomatic environment could further isolate the U.S economically. The big problem is where it all ends. Already major voices in the European Union (particularly from Germany) have threatened retaliatory tariffs on politically and symbolically sensitive American exports like bourbon, blue jeans, and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Trump has threatened to tax European cars, if the EU follows through on those threats. Given the personalities involved, and the national pride at stake, it's not hard to see that this tit-for-tat could escalate quickly and lead to a full-blown trade war on multiple fronts. But this is not a war we can win. A decline in imports will force us to rely on our own production to meet all of our consumption. But we no longer make large categories of products that we consume. Even if we were to be able to ramp up production quickly, American consumers would be looking at much higher prices. With plenty of indications that inflation is already starting to percolate, now is not a time to go out looking for more. But most concerning is the likelihood that a large decline in trade translates into a diminished international appetite for U.S. dollars. With government borrowing about to surpass $1 trillion annually (even while the Federal Reserve itself is set to begin selling more than $600 billion annually in Treasury bonds) we will need to find lots of buyers for U.S. dollars for years to come. If a trade war discourages those buyers, the dollar will fall and interest rates will rise even faster. But it could get much worse than that. If a recession forces the Federal Reserve into another round of quantitative easing, we will desperately need foreigners to show up at our bond auctions. If they don't we will lose the ability to export our inflation, and all the excess liquidity will remain at home, where it will push up prices on the limited domestic supply of goods and services. This means even higher prices for American consumers, many of which will also be unemployed. The combination of rising unemployment and inflation will be bad politics for Trump, as it will allow democrats to use the ""misery index"" to defeat him in 2020 much as Ronald Reagan used it to defeat one-term Democratic Jimmy Carter forty years earlier. Let's hope that Trump's bluster on trade is just a negotiating tactic. Maybe he's crazy like a fox, and his threats will produce a favorable outcome for the U.S. But given his international unpopularity, and how quickly world leaders have mobilized for war, I wouldn't count on it. More likely his blunders on trade will simply move our day of economic reckoning that much closer.","Chris Keane/Reuters President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum could lead to a broader trade war.

Rhodilee Jean Dolor,"Amazon has made it voice-controlled assistant Alexa more useful in the modern kitchen. Amazon has unveiled a slew of new Alexa gadgets at an event in Seattle on Thursday. The move shows how the world’s largest online retailer works to make its voice assistant Alexa more ubiquitous than ever. One of the more unusual of the new 15 Alexa-enabled devices is the AmazonBasics microwave, that users can control with their voice. The new microwave connects to the Alexa-powered Echo device via Bluetooth. According to Techcrunch, the voice-controlled microwave started as an in-house reference product as Amazon was developing an API for third parties to develop their Alexa-enabled devices. The company said at the event that the microwave is “still stuck in the late 70s” so it decided to build a new one. One of the challenges in building the product is how to make the microwave work with Wi-Fi signals, but the company managed to figure this out. Alexa is not built-in. The appliance works with a nearby Echo, allowing users to cook things via voice. The built-in Ask Alexa button allows users to talk to the assistant. “AmazonBasics Microwave simplifies cooking by letting you microwave using your voice and an Echo device. Just say, ‘Alexa, reheat one cup of coffee,’ and Alexa will start reheating with the appropriate power and time settings,” Amazon described its new smart microwave oven. The team who developed the device also integrated Dash replenishment services inside the oven, so users who run low on popcorn can easily order more directly from the device. Dave Limp, the senior vice president of Amazon Devices, demonstrated how Alexa and the new microwave works together at the Amazon hardware event. The microwave comes with a range of quick-cook voice presets so users won’t have to agonize figuring out the cooking and heating time of different things. The product is not the first microwave to feature Alexa voice control features. Engadget said that companies such as Whirlpool, LG, Kenmore, and GE have already made or are working on similar appliances. The AmazonBasics microwave, however, is the first Amazon-branded microwave, which could mean better integration with Alexa. Will consumers buy it, or the other Alexa devices that Amazon just launched? Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Reuters it is too early to speculate. “One or more of these products is likely to resonate, but (it’s) impossible to speculate today,” Pachter said.

"Steve Almasy, CNN","(CNN) More than an hour passed before a University of Maryland football trainer called 911 after a player, who later died, first showed symptoms of heatstroke, an independent report issued Friday says. Jordan McNair, a 19-year-old offensive lineman, died June 13, weeks after taking part in an offseason conditioning session at Maryland's turf outdoor practice field in late May. The report, compiled by a sports medicine company, cites five issues with McNair's treatment: • Failure to assess his vital signs, including core temperature • Failing to quickly recognize he was having heat illness and not properly treating him as his condition worsened • Not having proper cooling devices, such as immersion tanks, near the workout site • Having to retrieve respiratory aids in a ""trauma bag"" • Not giving emergency responders best directions or sending someone outside to meet ambulances ""The literature tells us that if we identify heatstroke within 30 minutes... and do cold water immersion, (when) we identify the elevated core temperature, that that is best practice. That didn't happen that day,"" Dr. Rod Walters, who submitted the report, said at a news conference Friday. Walters said he did not make a determination as to whether McNair's death was an accident or due to negligence. He said McNair's case wasn't the usual heatstroke event with the typical outward symptoms. McNair took turn for worse, staff called 911 On May 29, McNair, a redshirt freshman, was taken from the field, where the air temperature was 81 degrees, at 5:22 p.m. That was 34 minutes after he said he was having cramps and was bending over at the waist. About 28 minutes after he was taken from the field, in the training, McNair's mood dramatically worsened -- a sign of heatstroke -- and a trainer called the team doctor, who advised calling 911, the report says. It had been one hour and seven minutes since symptoms were first noticed. There was a chance to save McNair, the report indicated. ""Even if the symptoms were not identified on the field, if core temperature had been assessed with the change in mental status at 17:50 pm, there might have been the opportunity to reverse the patient's core temperature,"" it says. Because McNair then began having a seizure and respiratory distress, trainers called authorities a second time to request another ambulance with advanced cardiac life support. When asked why the staff didn't use a cold whirlpool to treat McNair, the head trainer told Walters they feared the lineman, who weighed 341 pounds on May 29, could drown. Instead they used drinking water, cold towels and ice packs. Walters called them inadequate. Several players who were interviewed said McNair looked exhausted on the field after the seventh of 10 110-yard sprints. One said the head trainer yelled for assistants to ""get him the (expletive) up,"" and another player reported he told them to drag his (expletive) across the field."" McNair completed two more sprints on his own, but needed help from teammates on the final one. He was taken to the training room as the rest of the team moved to grass field for football drills. University has taken responsibility In August, Athletic Director Damon Evans and university President Wallace D. Loh apologized to McNair's family during a meeting in Baltimore. Loh said he told the family the ""university accepts legal and moral responsibility for the mistakes that our training staff made on that fateful workout day."" Loh said he also told McNair's family: ""The university owes you an apology. You entrusted Jordan to our care, and he is never returning home."" At that time, the university placed its football coach, D.J. Durkin, and some members of the athletic staff on administrative leave. Official promises safer environment for athletes ""I wish that we could say that we could bring Jordan McNair back to life,"" James Brady, president of the board of regents, said Friday. ""That would be the greatest thing that we could possibly do. That cannot be done, and the tragedy that the McNair family has had to deal with cannot be overcome. ""But we can use this experience to make student-athlete safety much better and more focused than it might have been in the past."" Brady said he was not in a position to say the trainers were negligent, citing the fact that the board of regents has commissioned another investigation that will decide whether any coaches or trainers need to be disciplined or fired. ""We are in the process of gathering the facts,"" he said. ""I like to know what the facts are before we make any conclusions."" He said announcements will come in the ""not-too-distant future."" Since McNair's death, the university has added cooling stations, started testing players' hydration at practice, increased the length of breaks, put more trainers and doctors at events. Staff has also received more training from Walters, the school said. It also will use of cold tub therapy at summer workouts. Tanks were not at the session where McNair suffered heatstroke because the team changed plans on venues and didn't set them up at the practice fields. The report has additional proposals, such as establishing an athletic medicine review board, Loh said Friday in a letter to the university community, adding the athletic department will be implementing all recommendations. ""The safety and well-being of our students remains paramount,"" Loh wrote. Maryland's football team is 3-1 after defeating Minnesota 42-13 Saturday. Maryland players wore stickers with McNair's number on the helmets. They also wore stickers for a former Minnesota player who died this week at age 22 from cancer. CNN's Michelle Krupa, Darran Simon, Jason Hanna, Jay Croft and Kevin Dotson contributed to this report.","More than an hour passed before a University of Maryland football trainer called 911 after a player, who later died, first showed symptoms of heatstroke, an independent report issued Friday says.",2018-09-23T00:10:52Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Maryland football player who died from heat stroke needed cold immersion therapy,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/22/us/maryland-jordan-mcnair-death-report/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180812072942-jordan-mcnair-university-of-maryland-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,whirlpool,1
Ben Lovejoy,"After yesterday announcing Apple Watch control of ovens, washing machines and dryers, Whirlpool now wants to apply connected kitchen smarts to reducing the amount of food that goes to waste … Engadget reports that it is pairing the Yummly smart recipe network it bought last year with its connected cookers. Yummly’s app has been reengineered with computer vision smarts that’ll come in handy when you’ve got a half-stocked refrigerator and no idea what to eat. Use your smartphone’s camera to scan all of the items in the coolbox and its computer vision chops will divine a recipe for you. Once you’ve decided what you’re going to cook, the information will be pushed to one of a new range of Whirlpool cookers. A small, 5-inch wide touchscreen on the stovetop will then display step-by-step instructions for each phase of the recipe. Connecting a recipe app to a cooker isn’t new – Innit announced that last month for over 100 different ovens from GE Appliances and Bosch – but what is new is using it to transform that random collection of leftovers in your fridge into a tasty meal. As with all too many CES announcements, there’s no exact word yet on availability or pricing, but Whirlpool’s guidance is ‘second half of the year’ and toward the higher end of the cooker price range.

Clayton Moore,"If you’re in the market for a washing machine, you’ll likely have to fork over more cash than before. Consumer Reports writes that washing machine prices are on the rise, but no one seems to know for sure whether it’s demand, economics or President Donald Trump’s new tariffs that are to blame. The administration imposed a 20 percent tariff on the first 1.2 million large residential washers imported in 2018 in January, as well as a 50 percent tariff on machines above that amount. These tariffs decrease to 16 percent and 45 percent in 2019 and drop again to 16 percent and 40 percent, respectively, in 2020. To analyze the current market, Consumer Reports partnered with Gap Intelligence to examine 14 machines, including seven front loaders and seven high-efficiency top loaders in the magazine’s washing machine ratings. Analysts tracked washing machine prices from early 2017 through the first quarter of 2018. The washers in the sample included Whirlpool, Maytag, GE Appliances, and South Korea-based manufacturers LG and Samsung. Both Whirlpool and GE Appliances have already notified retailers that prices will be increasing, citing vague reasons like “significant cost increases,” “raw material increases,” and “investments in innovation.” The report noted that prices have remained steady since the tariff went into effect. However, LG represented a significant exception with price hikes up to eight percent starting in March. Samsung has not revealed any new pricing structures. Other tariffs could also mean higher prices. In addition to the machines themselves, the administration is also imposing tariffs on washing machine parts, which could drive costs higher for manufacturers. Another factor that could impact prices is the recent imposition of steep tariffs on imported steel (25 percent) and imported aluminum (10 percent). Goldman Sachs recently released a forecast predicting an eight to 20 percent increase in the price of a new washing machine due to tariffs. It remains to be seen whether consumers will feel the heat from the tariffs anytime soon. Manufacturers could be sitting on existing inventory received prior to the tariff ruling. The Wall Street Journal reported in January that shipments of foreign-made washers more than doubled in November from shipping statistics a year earlier. However, the growing demand for smart home technology, particularly in home appliances, could cause this strategy to backfire on manufacturers. Another factor that could stave off price increases for consumers is the growing presence of foreign manufacturers locating manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Samsung recently opened a new $380 million washing machine assembly plant in Newberry County, South Carolina. Meanwhile, LG is already hosting job fairs in Clarksville, Tennessee, to staff its new $250 million plant, expected to be completed by the end of 2018. The washing machine tariff, which also applies to solar panels, is unusual because it wasn’t imposed due to unfair trade practices by other countries, but because U.S. manufacturers complained of unfair competition from foreign competitors. That was the finding of the U.S. International Trade Commission, which made the tariff recommendations to Trump. Specifically, the offended party was the Whirlpool Corporation, which praised the tariffs upon their imposition. Meanwhile, Korean manufacturers LG and Samsung condemned the tariffs, with the latter calling them “a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine.” Analysts recommend that consumers not pay too much attention to the debate and to watch for discounts around holidays like President’s Day and Memorial Day.

Nancy Mitchell,"As a young girl, and budding design enthusiast, one of my favorite things was to go to the Parade of Homes with my mother. I was in awe of all the over-the-top early '90s design we saw, and particularly in awe of the enormous bathrooms, with their wall-to-wall carpet and luxuriously massive whirlpool tubs. My mother did not share my enthusiasm. Yes, she said—but who's going to clean it? As an 8 year old, cleaning a tub did not seem like any big obstacle to having the home of my dreams. Now I am an adult, and I do all the cleaning myself, and I realize that my mother was right—when considering a design, it's wise to keep maintenance in mind, as well as visual appeal. I still love the whirlpool tubs. And I love these 10 designs, too, although I would not want to be the one to have to clean them. It was a conversation between myself and Dabney, our Projects Editor, that inspired this post. The folded metal backsplash in this project by Hunting &amp; Narud is absolutely gorgeous—but the idea of wiping it down does not seem particularly fun. I read your comments, and I know that if there's one thing Apartment Therapy readers hate more than books organized by color, it's tile countertops. I've never had a tile countertop, and this one, in a Portuguese beach house by Vera Iachia (via Planete Deco ) is pretty enough that I might ignore all the horror stories. But I've heard whispers that cleaning these things isn't pleasant. I love taking baths, and I've always thought oversized, freestanding tubs (like this one from Studio DB ) were dreamy. But how in the world do you clean one? They seem too big to reach in—do you have to clean sitting inside the tub itself? Owners of very large tubs, enlighten me. And then there's the problem of the sunken tub, a design detail I unabashedly love but don't even want to think about cleaning. (This one from Block 722, via Design./Visual., is a particularly lovely example.) If you have a sunken tub like this, how do you clean it? Do you curse the day you were born? This massive soaking tub lined in terra cotta tile, a design of PAr, is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. It is also, I imagine, not very fun to clean. At all. The wooden sink in this home from Boliga, via Trendland, is lovely to look at, but cleaning in and around it seems like kind of a pain. I love the look of tiny tile—as long as it's not the dreaded hyper-iridescent early-2000s stuff, it can actually be very nice. This installation by Architect Prineas proves my point—but still, I do get a little nervous when thinking about all. that. grout. Compared to a tile countertop or a brick backsplash this kitchen design from Brian O Tuama Architects represents a real walk in the park, but I still wouldn't be super jazzed to clean random food spatters off that highly textured subway tile backsplash. (Who are we kidding, I would totally do it to have this kitchen.)","As a young girl, and budding design enthusiast, one of my favorite things was to go to the Parade of Homes with my mother.

Ashley Collman,"A suburb of Portland, Maine is gaining international attention for the perfectly circular ice floe that has formed in a local river. 
 The ice floe started gaining attention when workers in nearby office buildings in Westbrook returned to work on Monday. 
 In addition to the ice sheet's symmetrical form, which makes for stunning pictures, the circle is captivating because it continues to move in a counter-clockwise rotation. Pictures and videos of the marvel have been republished by outlets around the world, including news websites in the UK and New Zealand. 
 Tina Radel, the town's marketing and communications manager, told the Associated Press that the ice floe formed in a part of the river that has a circular current, which creates a whirlpool effect. 
 But experts say there may be a more complicated scientific explanation for how it formed. 
Read more:Mind-blowing pictures show what it's like to cook outside in one of the coldest places on Earth
 Paul Nakroshis, an associate professor of physics at the University of Southern Maine, told Maine Public that he started reading research papers on similar ice circles after this one popped up this week. He said one paper was published in a well-respected journal in 2016 that theorized the spinning had to do with ice melting underneath the disk. 
 When the ice melts, he explained, it becomes more dense and sinks downward, creating ""a vortex that causes the disk to rotate."" But Nakroshis said he's not sure that theory works when applied to the Presumpscot River, which is much colder than the temperatures created in the lab experiment. 
 ""So most likely the cause of the rotation is just the river water going by the disk, and once it starts rotating in that direction it's probably going to continue,"" Nakorshis told Maine Public. 
 While somewhat rare, ice circles have been noticed in the colder climates of North American and Europe. Earlier this month, another disk appeared in the Vigala River, in rural Estonia. 
 City officials told WGME that the disk in Maine will likely only stick around for a few days, until it either melts or the entire river freezes. 
 So the ice circle has become somewhat of a tourist destination for Mainers looking to catch a glimpse of the rare site. 
 Meanwhile, the circle is offering entertainment for local birds as a naturally occurring carousel. 
 Rob Mitchell, who owns an office building near the ice circle, told the Portland Press Herald that ducks are sitting on the spinning ice sheet like it's a ""big Lazy Susan."" 
 ""It's a big duck-go-round,"" he said.","A perfectly symmetrical circle of ice has formed in the Presumpscot River in Westbrook, Maine.

The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) calls it one of "" astronomy's galactic darlings.""

It also is noted for its closeness to companion galaxy NGC 5195, which may be affecting the structure of the Whirlpool itself. M51 was first catalogued by Charles Messier in 1773 while the astronomer was plotting objects in the sky that could confuse comet-hunters. ""M51"" is a reference to ""Messier 51,"" one of about 110 entries now plotted in his Catalogue of Nebulas and Star Clusters. (The companion NGC 5195 was discovered in 1781 by Pierre Méchain, who the University of Manitoba describes as a close friend to Messier.) It would take about 70 years to learn more about the fuzzy object's structure, however. It was first discerned by William Parsons, using a 72-inch reflector telescope in 1845. ""His drawing of the spiral galaxy M51 is a classic work of mid-19th-century astronomy,"" said Encyclopedia Britannica of Parsons' observations. Parsons' discovery was the first so-called ""spiral nebula"" ever discovered, and in the five years following he found 14 more of these objects, according to the STScI. It was unclear for decades if these objects were a part of the Milky Way Galaxy or things that were independent of that. It wasn't until Edwin Hubble used Cepheid variable stars to chart cosmic distances in M31 (the Andromeda Galaxy) in the 1920s that astronomers understood they were actually distant galaxies.

Credit: Conrad Jung There's been a veritable cornucopia of supernovas in the Whirlpool in recent years. Skywatchers recorded supernovas in 1994, 2005 and 2011. ""Three supernovas in 17 years is a lot for single galaxy, and reasons for the supernova surge in M51 are being debated,"" noted the NASA website Astronomy Picture of the Day in 2011, without elaborating on the possible explanations. The latest supernova, called SN 2011dh, was at its brightest in June 2011 before slipping back into obscurity. After the event, astronomers scoured older pictures to see if they could find the source of the explosion. They narrowed their search to a yellow supergiant star (visible in Hubble Space Telescope pictures) that was there before the explosion, and appears to be missing afterwards. While most yellow supergiants aren't expected to go supernova when they finish out their lives, the team said it's possible that the star was actually a binary star. The other star would have been a bluer, hotter star that was close enough to pull some of the yellow supergiant's mass away. Given enough time, this would have destabilized the star and caused the explosion, astronomers said. The blue star wasn't spotted in Hubble photos, but astronomers added that it is likely best visible in ultraviolet light — a band of light that Hubble does not look at. ""The present results reveal the necessity and importance of further studying the evolution and explosion of binary stars,"" said Melina Bersten of the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Japan, who led the team, in a statement. ""I look forward to the observation that will confirm our prediction."" The Whirlpool's arms are one of the more prominent observed in spiral galaxies, STScI noted. The group said this could be because of what they termed a ""close encounter"" with its companion galaxy, NGC 5195. ""As NGC 5195 drifts by, its gravitational muscle pumps up waves within the Whirlpool's pancake-shaped disk. The waves are like ripples in a pond generated when a rock is thrown in the water,"" STScI stated. ""When the waves pass through orbiting gas clouds within the disk, they squeeze the gaseous material along each arm's inner edge. The dark dusty material looks like gathering storm clouds. These dense clouds collapse, creating a wake of star birth."" Over time, the biggest stars would then radiate away the surrounding gas, leaving behind blue star clusters that are easily visible in the Whirlpool's arms, STScI added. More generally, the fact that the galaxy is so close by allows astronomers to look at its structure and way it forms stars, with the aim of extrapolating that understanding to other galaxies. In 2015, NASA released an image of the Whirlpool galaxy that the Chandra X-Ray Observatory captured over 250 hours of observation time. The space telescope observed 500 X-ray sources in the galaxy's region, racking up about five times the number of sources observed in previous studies. At least 10 of these sources are believed to come from black holes. With the rise of inexpensive and powerful camera equipment, the Whirlpool is becoming a popular target for amateur astronomers. Space.com has examples of photos taken by amateurs in 2011 and 2015.",The Whirlpool Galaxy is a spiral galaxy that is relatively close to Earth — about 30 million light-years away.,2018-01-12T13:48:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Space.com'}",Whirlpool Galaxy: Exploding With Supernovas,https://www.space.com/25506-whirlpool-galaxy.html,https://img.purch.com/h/1000/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzAyMC84NDgvb3JpZ2luYWwvZGN0LWZpcnN0LWxpZ2h0LXdoaXJscG9vbC5qcGc=,,Space.com,whirlpool,1
Ashlee Clark-Thompson,"Bixby Vision lets you scan your food to get an estimated calorie count. Sarah Tew/CNET Some of the features of Samsung's newest phones, the Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S9 Plus, have left me shook. Not because of the onward march of smartphone technology; rather, it feels like Samsung has been spying on me. The new Galaxy smartphones contain Bixby Vision, a tool within the camera app that uses optical image recognition. With Bixby Vision, you can turn the phone's camera to the meal you're about to eat, and an estimated calorie count will come up on your screen. And Bixby Vision will also let you virtually try on makeup from Sephora and CoverGirl thanks to software from a company called ModiFace, who've created augmented reality (AR) mirrors at MAC makeup stores. I spend a lot of time hopping between MyFitnessPal and Instagram when I'm on my iPhone. In MyFitnessPal, I try my damnedest to keep track of what I've eaten to count calories and shave off a pound or two. Instagram is my happy place where I can get lost in 30-second clips of makeup tutorials by polished professional makeup artists and eager cosmetic enthusiasts. And in one fell swoop, Samsung added a feature that has given me the wandering eye away from my iPhone. The inclusion of Bixby Vision in the latest Galaxy phones makes a good case for incorporating more AR into your everyday life rather than just an excuse to hunt Pokemon or find the right Ikea couch. Samsung has made Bixby Vision a native part of its phones -- you don't have to download an app to access the feature. And the focus on health and beauty takes aim at folks like me who regularly turn to apps to manage their lives (and maybe learn a makeup trick or two). Adding health and beauty centric features also appears to be a ploy to get more women to be attracted to Samsung phones. Studies have shown that women prefer the iPhone over Samsung phones. Including a built-in way to see how you look in new makeup is about as subtle as holding up a hot-pink poster with the words, ""Women, buy me!"" over the Galaxy phones. (Not to say that men aren't great with a makeup brush; just check out this young man.) Samsung isn't alone in turning to AR to bolster health-related features on smart devices. Later this year, the Whirlpool-owned Yummly app will visually scan and identify foods and give you recipe recommendations based on what it sees. I wouldn't be surprised if we soon see a camera or app that is smart enough to identify foods, recommend recipes AND provide calorie estimates. And in that case, I'll have my checkbook ready (yes, I still write checks). We still have to see whether the Bixby Vision feature is any good -- I'm still not completely sold on Bixby, Samsung's voice assistant that still lacks the track record of competitors Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple's Siri. And the Galaxy S9's AR Emoji, an answer to Apple's Animoji, veer more toward eerie than ingenious. But Bixby Vision and its potential to actually be a tool I'd use have gotten my attention.","Commentary: Thanks to Bixby Vision on the forthcoming Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus, you can ""try on"" makeup and get an estimated calorie count of your meal with the phones' cameras.

,"In 1845, this vast telescope observed the first spiral galaxy Lebrecht Music and Arts Photo Library / Alamy Stock Photo By Jonathon Keats LATE one summer night in 1845, the 3rd Earl of Rosse climbed up to an 18-metre-high platform to focus a telescope on a nebula known as M51. At the time, the telescope was the world’s biggest, and operating it took considerable stamina. But what Rosse saw was worth his effort. The light resolved into a whirlpool – the first spiral galaxy ever observed. Rosse’s resulting drawing is humble and astonishing. The ink smudges lack the grandeur of the Hubble Space Telescope’s images of M51 (the Whirlpool galaxy), but they were stunningly accurate. It exemplifies astronomy’s close link to technology: more powerful instruments allow more penetrating insights.

Alice O'Connor,"Another long weekend? What a treat! We’re off on Monday then will be back in full force on Tuesday. Bank holidays are traditionally times to visit the seaside, or sit in honking motorway queues headed towards the seaside at least, so I assume that’s what we’re all up to. But bookending that, video games, yeah? What are you playing this weekend? Here’s what we’re clicking on! John: If there are spare moments, it’s going to be more God Of War. I’m very close to the end now, so deliberately ticking off missed quests and being disappointed that the much-hyped rewards are armour I’m already far beyond.

Ruchi Kumar,"New Delhi, India - It was early March, 2014, and India was buzzing with activities that often precede a parliamentary election of this magnitude, in the world's largest democracy. Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, a whistle-blowing website, put out a statement refuting claims of an unlikely endorsement of Narendra Modi, then prime ministerial candidate and the eventual frontrunner. The statement was issued after several infographics were shared across social media with fake quotes, attributed to Assange, praising Modi. For the first time in the nation's history, digital media, a force that had grown powerful over the last decade, was employed aggressively by political parties to woo the voters. After all, nearly 37 percent of urban Indian voters were connected to some form of social media, according to a survey by Google in 2013. Fake information is building fear psychosis among people. Pratik Sinha, founder of AltNews The internet not only helped bring in the young voters, but also sway their favourability towards the running candidates. However, this relatively cheap and, in many ways, revolutionary platform also created a whirlpool of misinformation that continues to create unwelcome ripples across the nation. During the elections, Modi's campaign managers had invested themselves heavily into tapping this medium to set the narrative towards an incontrovertible win. Debunking fake news Visual cues, such as photos and graphics, portraying Modi as the saviour of the nation, alongside memes mocking the other parties' candidates were shared on social media and WhatsApp messenger by a team of dedicated Modi supporters, their numbers stretching into the far hundred thousands. In another instance, a photo meant to show a younger, humble Modi sweeping the floors went viral, and was later debunked as a doctored image of another man. That didn't matter, though; for a very long time during and after the elections, the photo had become a symbol of Modi's modest roots. It continues to be purported that their social media warfare was not only effective in communication, but also contributed to Modi's win in the elections. However, the veracity of their claims remains questionable. Three years on, little has changed. If anything, things have become more abysmal. In May this year, just days before the third anniversary of inauguration of the current Indian government, a mob in the eastern state of Jharkhand went on a killing spree, triggered by a simple WhatsApp message. Three innocent men were beaten to death by an angry mob that wrongly believed those men were human traffickers, based on a warning they received in the messages. As dystopian as it may seem, the fake news problem in India is very real. In all, seven people lost their lives in two separate incidences in Jharkhand, in a fury that was born on social media and based on falsified information that the killers received over WhatsApp messenger. ""Fake information is building fear psychosis among people,"" explains Pratik Sinha, founder of AltNews, a web platform dedicated to verifying and debunking the scourge of fake news in circulation. Dangerous consequences AltNews operates with a small team of four people, most working part-time, focusing solely on countering false information that threatens dangerous consequences. ""It [fake news] has added to the tension within communities, and, over the years, several people have lost lives because of false information and rumours,"" he adds, emphasising the need for platforms such as his that provide a mirror to the mainstream media that often contributes to the online rumours mill. Indeed, other websites and platforms, such as SMHoaxSlayer and BoomLive, with formats similar to AltNews, have cropped up in the last year to fight the grievous rise of fake information among the Indian population, that remains gullible to it. A couple of months after the Jharkhand incident, in July, amidst a communal flare-up in the state of West Bengal, a BJP leader, Vijeta Malik, shared a screenshot from a local feature film showing a woman being molested, and tried to pass it as an image of Muslims molesting Hindu women. Vijeta is part of a far-right political movement that is pushing a Hindu supremacist (or Hindutva) narrative. In fact, ongoing tension itself was believed to have been a result of an image offensive to Muslims circulated through Facebook and attributed to a Hindu boy. While websites like AltNews rake up to a million views a month, the lack of human resources to counter people like Vijeta adds another layer of challenge for Sinha and his team. They have to prioritise investigations based on the urgency afforded to the matter. ""If a politician is at the forefront of spreading fake news, we give that priority, since they have influence."" He explains their methodology, using a scientific approach and empirical evidence to counter fiction presented as facts. However, if a video is involved, that takes precedence over all else. ""Videos are a high priority, because they are always so dangerous when carrying false information,"" he illustrates with the example of a series of fake videos that went viral after India lost a cricket match against Pakistan in June. ""Multiple videos were circulated on WhatsApp allegedly showing Indian Muslims celebrating the victory of Pakistan. All except one of those videos was genuine; it was from Indian-administered Kashmir. All the other videos, and there were multiple ones from around the country, were fake,"" he recalls. Having investigated the sources of every single video, each could have led to communal tensions and violent incidents in parts of India, Sinha said. How is fake news circulated? Surprisingly, fake news production and circulation seem rather meticulous and well-organised. Websites such as Postcard News, an Indian version of Breitbart, have cropped up and made a successful business model out of distribution of false, albeit provocative, news stories with catchy clickbait headlines. Despite their articles being frequently debunked, they continue to produce and cite false stories that suit the right-wing popular narrative. These articles, and the website, get further momentum when shared by prominent BJP leaders and right-wing influencers on social media. Additionally, a blitzkrieg strategy is adopted on social media, wherein BJP followers post tweets and messages taken from a common template created in advance, with the idea of pushing a suitable ""trend"" to popularity. One such template acquired by Al Jazeera, created on a Google document, shows the centralised nature of a social media campaign designed to push its agenda aggressively and without much regard for facts. Pankaj Jain, founder of SMHoaxSlayer, feels the fake news machinery is not designed to serve the interests of just one political entity or ideology. ""Politics is dirty, and now everyone is employing fake news as a strategy for power play,"" he said, illustrating with a story they recently debunked, involving false claims by the opposition about a railway project signed by the ruling party. Elaborating on the role of mobile-based messenger applications, he remains cautiously fearful of the role of WhatsApp. ""While WhatsApp isn't the only platform, in India, it does play an important role in circulation of fake news,"" he explains, adding how the technology makes it easy for those circulating fake information to erase their digital crumbs. ""It allows you to forward a message and then completely delete it from your own system, thereby shedding responsibility. Also, often those messages ""forwarded as received"" are also easily edited to suit one's agenda,"" he adds. Indeed, according to recent statistics, the messaging application owned by the social media giant has over 200 million active users as of February 2017, making the reach of the platform diverse and wide. The business of fake news ""If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it."" The quote that is often, and ironically, wrongly attributed to Joseph Goebbels – the propaganda minister during Nazi Germany - perhaps best sums up what's happening in India. Repetitive tweets and posts on a particular topic, or hashtag, are aimed at trending the related subject to the extent that it becomes a popular, believable narrative. More interestingly, those participating in this blitzkrieg action are not just BJP's online foot soldiers, but also members of the parliament as well as several ministers in Modi's cabinet. Indian ministers have often been called out for sharing images and information on social media that is in fact untrue. For instance, Minister of State for Power, Coal, Energy and Mines, Piyush Goyal, tweeted a photo about the street-lighting programme by the government with a photo of a street in Russia. Attempts to reach three officials and spokespersons of BJP were met with weak engagements and eventual silence. Not only has the fake news industry aided in upholding and pushing through a certain political agenda, but it can also be highly profitable, which would explain its recent ascent after the 2014 elections. Jain puts the responsibility of this epidemic on the consumers of the information. ""The only driving force in fake news in the existing, strongly-held bias among people,"" he insists. ""They like to hear sugar-coated lies in the name of country, religion or community, while elsewhere there is someone minting money from such lies,"" he says.",Social media has created a whirlpool of misinformation that continues to create unwelcome ripples across India.,2017-12-12T04:46:47Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",The growing tide of fake news in India,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/growing-tide-fake-news-india-171210122732217.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/12/10/16ad67b647454c31849d04f9c7a46d88_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,whirlpool,1
Elizabeth Howell,"Three powerful space observatories reveal the Whirlpool Galaxy as a wonder of star formation and star death in a new video from the Space Telescope Science Institute, which performs the science operations for the Hubble Space Telescope.
The 3-minute series of images opens with a stunning visual-wavelength view of the galaxy, a supernova (star explosion)-rich zone that lies about 30 million light-years from Earth in the direction of the northern constellation Canes Venatici. The Whirlpool Galaxy is officially known by astronomers as M51 or NGC 5194.
""The Whirlpool Galaxy is perhaps the most striking example of a spiral galaxy,"" Hubble officials say in the video. ""Different wavelength observations reveal different structures in the galaxy. In three dimensions, the galaxy's spiral arms whirl through a pancake-shaped disk."" [When Galaxies Collide: Amazing Hubble Telescope Photos]
The video steps through different wavelength observations of the galaxy in visible light (Hubble), infrared light (Spitzer Space Telescope) and X-rays (Chandra X-Ray Observatory), explaining what each space telescope shows astronomers. 
The Whirlpool galaxy, seen here in a still from a NASA video, stars in a stunning new visualization that combines observations from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes and Chandra X-ray Observatory.

In visible light, astronomers can spot some older and younger stars: The yellower and older stars are near the center of the galaxy, while younger and bluer stars tend to cluster in the galaxy's spiral arms. Infrared light shows the oldest and reddest stars, which populate the entire galaxy. Meanwhile, X-rays show the high-energy zones. This includes energetic emissions from binary star systems with black holes or neutron stars. (A neutron star is the densely packed star core left behind after the original star explodes in a supernova.)
Different wavelengths can also reveal the overall structure of the galaxy, the video explains. Embedded in the center of Whirlpool is a supermassive black hole, which emits powerful X-rays. Cool gas and dust in the arms shines in infrared temperatures, revealing the galactic structure. Meanwhile, hotter gas in stellar nurseries shows the presence of supernova explosions, which heats the gas to high temperatures.
""The contrasting features seen in multiwavelength studies greatly enhance our understanding of galactic structure,"" the video concludes.

Caroline Valetkevitch,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Thursday, giving the Nasdaq its biggest daily gain since March, as Microsoft’s upbeat earnings spurred a rebound in technology names and investors snapped up oversold shares. The Nasdaq rose 3 percent, a day after it confirmed a correction and registered its biggest decline since 2011. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 both moved back in positive territory for the year. Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) jumped 5.8 percent after it beat consensus estimates for revenue and profit. That, along with gains in chipmakers, helped technology stocks.SPLRCT rise 2.89 percent. “It’s a little bit of an oversold bounce. Earnings have helped,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. Yet, he said, “you can’t look at it blindly and say earnings are turning the market around and we’re all clear. A lot of people are skeptical right now of any kind of action in the market, especially to the upside.” The market also has had lighter trading volume on up days than down, which Pavlik said suggested the recent bout of selling might not be over. About 9.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Thursday, compared with 9.6 billion in Wednesday’s rout and 11.44 billion when it sold off on Oct. 11. The latest round of upbeat results came from a wide range of companies, including Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), Visa Inc ( V.N ), Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ) and Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ), and offered relief after the earnings season began on a tepid note and then geared lower on sluggish outlooks from manufacturers and chipmakers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average.DJI rose 401.13 points, or 1.63 percent, to 24,984.55, the S&amp;P 500.SPX gained 49.47 points, or 1.86 percent, to 2,705.57 and the Nasdaq Composite.IXIC added 209.94 points, or 2.95 percent, to 7,318.34. The Nasdaq registered its biggest daily percentage gain since March 26. Stocks have sold off recently amid worries over the impact of tariffs and China’s profit slowdown, as well as concerns ranging from rising costs, bond yields, Italy’s budget struggles and upcoming U.S. congressional elections. In a further sign that economic growth is moderating, U.S. business spending on equipment appeared to have remained slow in September and the goods trade deficit widened further as rising imports outpaced a rebound in exports. But the recent sell-off has also made stocks slightly cheaper. The S&amp;P 500’s valuation fell to a two-and-a-half year low of 15.3 times profit estimates for the next 12 months from 15.8, according to Refinitiv data. Results from S&amp;P 500 companies have pushed up third-quarter profit growth estimates to 23.6 percent from 21.8 percent in the last 10 days. But dour forecasts have pulled down fourth-quarter growth estimates to 19.4 percent from 19.9 percent, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

India Block,"A visitor to the Serralves museum in Porto, Portugal, has been hospitalised after falling in an art installation designed by Anish Kapoor. British artist Kapoor's 1992 piece, Descent into Limbo, features a cube-shaped building with a 2.5-metre hole set into its floor, which is painted black to give the impression of an infinite drop. An Italian man in his 60s fell over inside the installation at the Serralves, reported local newspaper Público. It is unclear if he fell into the hole or within the general vicinity. The man is now recovering in hospital, and the area of the exhibition where the work is displayed has been closed off for repairs. Related story Anish Kapoor's seemingly bottomless whirlpool installed in Brooklyn Bridge Park A spokesperson for the museum said all security measures had been followed, including warning signs and a member of gallery staff positioned inside the installation. When the Descent into Limbo reopens the museum plans to add additional warning signs. Anish Kapoor: Works, Thoughts, Experiments is the first major show for the artist in Portugal, and Descent into Limbo is the oldest of his 56 work's on display in the museum's parklands. The Serrevales museum, which opened in 1999, was designed by Portuguese architect Álvaro Siza Vieira. Also in the grounds is the Casa de Serralves, an art deco villa and museum designed by architects Charles Siclis with José Marques da Silva in the Streamline Moderne style. Related story Anish Kapoor explores ""urgent times"" with Destierro installation Turner Prize-winning artist Kapoor often plays with optical illusions that create the impression of infinite depths in his work, such as the seemingly bottomless whirlpool he installed in a park in New York in 2017. The artist, who has been outspoken about opposing Donald Trump, said the piece stood as ""obvious"" comment on American politics. In 2016 he acquired exclusive rights to a the blackest black, a pigment developed by British company NanoSystems that absorbs 99.96 per cent of light. Kapoor's attempt to monopolise the colour started a feud with fellow British artist Stuart Semple, who has attempted to bar Kapoor from using the ""world's pinkest pink"" and a colour-changing pigment.

As a third of the US grapples with brutally cold weather, scientists are assessing how much this might be down to long-term changes to our climate.
So whatever happened to global warming?
That's certainly what President Donald Trump wanted to know when he tweeted this a couple of days ago:
""In the beautiful Midwest, wind chill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can't last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Warming? Please come back fast, we need you!""
There is no question the Midwest is cold - very cold. 
Just check the advice from the US National Weather Service. It has warned that the current low temperatures could easily ""freeze the flesh off your bones"". 
Don't leave home if you can avoid it, the NWS in Iowa urged, and if you do have to go out, ""avoid taking deep breaths; minimise talking"".
Meanwhile the internet is heaving under images of snow and ice. 
My favourites include the icy steam pouring off lake Lake Michigan and the thousands of people who have been doing the ""hot water challenge"". 
But this wonderfully surreal image of a fork frozen in a cascade of noodles wins for me.
Is the president right?
So, is this brutal cold snap evidence that global warming is faltering? 
Sadly, the answer is no, as one of the president's own agencies quickly pointed out in an apparent response to his tweet. 
""Winter storms don't prove that global warming isn't happening"" tweeted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The NOAA included a link to an article which suggests that severe snowstorms may even become more likely as the world warms. 
You have probably already heard that the current brutal weather is thanks to something called the ""polar vortex"". 
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 A man walks along the Chicago lakefront in frigid conditions
The polar vortex is a great gyre of air that forms each winter and circulates above the North Pole, way up in the stratosphere. 
It is like a whirlpool which holds icy polar air within a wall of powerful circular winds.
There's a great graphic illustrating how it works at the New York Times.
More on climate change
Sometimes the vortex breaks down, splitting up and spilling cold air out from the polar regions.
That is reckoned to have happened on the 3 January this year. 
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 The lakefront in Wisconsin looks more like Antarctica
The frigid air from the polar vortex warps the jet stream - another powerful air current, but much lower in the atmosphere - making it bulge down southwards.
It is this bulging of the jet stream that brought the merciless cold to the US this week, and the so-called Beast from the East to Europe last year.
But is it caused by climate change?
There is much debate within the world of meteorology about whether or not this breakdown of the polar vortex is becoming more common. 
Some studies suggest that it is, and some researchers say they suspect that this is down to climate change.
Jennifer Francis is a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Centre, which studies climate change impacts and solutions.
She argues that melting sea ice in the Arctic may be linked to changes in the polar vortex.
The dark, open ocean absorbs more heat than reflective ice, causing a hot spot, she told the New York Times.
She argues this hot spot, along with changes in the jet stream driven by climate change, could cause the polar vortex to break down.
But this is controversial stuff. Tim Woolings, a climate physicist at Oxford University, is not persuaded we are seeing a significant change.
The atmosphere is, he says, ""a very noisy system"" and ""there is no convincing evidence that these events are happening more often"".
Weather versus climate 
The important thing is to look at long-term average temperatures.
The current bone-cracking cold in Chicago is ""weather"" not ""climate"". 
The rule of thumb is that weather is what is happening outside your house now; climate is what happens over many years.
So, it can be very cold where you live but the world as a whole could still be getting warmer.
And be in no doubt, says Tim Woolings, the world is continuing to warm. 
As Chicago freezes, wildfires are raging in Australia which is in the grip of yet another blistering summer.

The 20 warmest years on record have all been in the past 22 years, with 2015 to 2018 making up the top four, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
And that does not persuade you, check out these seven charts.
This will be cold comfort for those of you shivering in the Midwest but, says Tim Woolings, the icy air that engulfed you this week would have been at least a degree colder had it not been for the warming that has already raised average winter temperatures in the arctic.","With the US in the grips of a bone-chilling spell, scientists take a look at longer-term implications.",2019-01-31T17:22:01Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Is polar vortex linked to climate change?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47078054,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3DC4/production/_105421851_gettyimages-1126452359.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,whirlpool,1

How would you live your life if you knew the day you were going to die? That's the question Chloe Benjamin's characters face in the heart-wrenching novel The Immortalists, the second novel from the San Francisco-based author. The story follows the Gold siblings who, as children, take a trek through Manhattan to visit a psychic who convinces them she knows the day that they will die. During this week's episode of MashReads, we discussed Benjamin's engrossing book and whether or not knowing your personal expiration date impacts the life you ultimately live. SEE ALSO: MashReads Podcast: Can Joe Hill's horror books stand out from his father's works? In The Immortalists, we are transported to New York City's Lower East Side in 1969. The Golds — Varya, Daniel, Klara, and Simon — each find themselves curious about a mysterious nomadic psychic they've discovered through word of mouth. At the insistence of the eldest brother, Daniel, they meet this woman, who individually tells them their fate. We then follow each character as they live their life with the prophecies, accurate or not, hanging over their heads. Simon builds a life for himself in San Francisco as a dancer while the AIDS epidemic swirls around him, while Klara attempts to become a magician. Daniel finds solace as a doctor in the army, and Varya dedicates her life to research as a scientist. Despite their wildly different lives, they each grapple with grief and whether or not they will take stock in what was told to them as children. Interview highlights (Edited lightly for length and clarity) Did you grow up with many siblings? A lot of this has to do with familial relations... can you tell me a bit about what made you want to write about four kids? I grew up in kind of a modern family, in San Francisco, with two sets of parents — one gay and one straight — and two brothers. One of my brothers is my mom and her partner Molly's child, and my other brother is the child of my mom and my dad. I think I've always been fascinated by family and by the different forms it can take, and also the way that people who start in the same petri dish can turn out so very different. ""I think I've always been fascinated by family and by the different forms it can take, and also the way that people who start in the same petri dish can turn out so very different."" How much did your own family experience inform both the individual characters and the structure of this book? My life seeps into the book in ways I don't always think about until later. While writing it, everything feels very fictional, but when looking back, certain things come from people I know. But these four siblings felt very like themselves to me. My life inspired certain things — like my love of San Francisco. I think that's why Simon's section is first. Subconsciously, I was able to start with that one because I knew the place and I was a dancer for many years. There was a lot I didn't know about — certainly the experience about being a gay man, especially at that time. But I think I share some DNA with that section that people might not expect. You start off with a fantastical premise, but then you explore these somber grounded themes of family, grief, and the curse/mystery of not knowing. How did you merge those components? I think for me it was more about exploring those deeper questions and this idea that you knew the date of your death... about uncertainty and how we cope with that. In terms of jobs and craft, what was it like diving into this magic world? I loved the magic research. I think that's another reason I have a soft spot for Klara. One of the things I thought was really interesting about it is gender. Klara is a female magician, and magic has always been and remains very white and male. Women are props, they're usually, frankly, being cut in half, put in a box, or surrounded by fire — and Klara doesn't want to be the assistant, she wants to be the star, and she actually has a male assistant, ultimately. There's a book I read, Hiding the Elephant by Jim Steinmeyer. If anybody is interested in magic, he's written this incredible exploration of a couple hundred years in magical history, but he also looks at the rivalries and the relationships between magicians over time. That interpersonal angle was really interesting to me. And as always, we close the show with recommendations: Chloe gives a shoutout to The Handmaids Tale (the book and the adaptation ), James Baldwin's Collected Essays (which she thinks everyone should read), and Jaimie Quatro's Fire Sermon. Peter recommends the Netflix show The End of the F***ing World which follows a British teen who is a self-identified sociopath who runs away with a fellow teen and struggles with his personal vow to ultimately kill her. ""It's this slightly nihilistic, slightly heartfelt look at two troubled people circling each other's troubles in a whirlpool of teenage angst,"" Peter explains. Martha continues her streak of unconventional recommendations — this time, keeping physical albums full of photographs. ""This is kind of in the vein of [ The Immortalists ], and how Ruby connects to her mother through old photographs that Daniel has."" MJ thinks you should read "" I Used to Insist I Didn't Get Angry. Not Anymore,"" an essay on female rage by Leslie Jamison (author of The Empathy Exams ) published earlier this year in the New York Times. ""I feel like that's the lesson of 2017, 2018. It is okay to be angry. It's so incredibly thoughtful in the way Leslie Jamison always is,"" MJ says. He also throws in another recommendation: poems by Sam Sax, specifically ""Written to be yelled at Trump tower during a vigil for the NEA."" You can watch Sax perform that here.

Caroline Valetkevitch,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks gained on Thursday as Microsoft’s strong earnings helped Nasdaq-listed companies stage a rebound from the tech-heavy index’s worst decline since 2011 in the previous session. Traders said investors also went bargain-hunting after the market rout on Wednesday that erased the Dow and the S&amp;P 500’s gains for the year and confirmed a correction for the Nasdaq. On Thursday, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were back in positive territory for the year. Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) jumped 6.3 percent after it beat consensus estimates for revenue and profit. That, along with gains in chipmakers, helped technology stocks.SPLRCT rise 2.89 percent. “It’s a little bit of an oversold bounce. Earnings have helped,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “But it could also be short-covering. So you can’t look at it blindly and say earnings are turning the market around and we’re all clear. A lot of people are skeptical right now of any kind of action in the market, especially to the upside. That’s why volume is light today.” The market has seen lighter volume in up days than down, which Pavlik said suggested the recent bout of selling might not be over. The latest round of upbeat results came from a wide range of companies, including Visa ( V.N ), Whirlpool ( WHR.N ), Twitter ( TWTR.N ) and American Airlines ( AAL.O ), and offered relief after the earnings season began on a tepid note and then geared lower on sluggish outlooks from manufacturers and chipmakers. That fanned worries over the impact of tariffs and China’s corporate profits slowdown, as well as concerns ranging from rising costs, bond yields, Italy’s budget struggles and upcoming U.S. congressional elections. In a further signs that economic growth is moderating, U.S. business spending on equipment appeared to have remained slow in September and the goods trade deficit widened further as rising imports outpaced a rebound in exports.

Ben Fox Rubin,"If you press all these Dash buttons at once, you get sent more Dash buttons. (OK, not really.)
Richard Peterson/CNET
Amazon has come up with some pretty odd ideas over the years: delivery inside your car, a talking tablet for your kitchen counter, and even an action series starring that guy from The Office.
One of the concepts that best captures the quirky imagination of the world's largest online retailer is the Dash button, a handy (and kind of ridiculous) device you press to reorder stuff like dog food, bottled water or septic treatment powder.
But the usefulness and novelty of Dash buttons has waned over the years, and Amazon said Thursday that it had decided to stop selling the gadgets globally. If you still proudly use a Dash button (or a few dozen), don't worry: Amazon plans to continue supporting new orders through existing Dash buttons so long as the public keeps using them.
So what killed the Dash button's future? Well, by Amazon's telling, the device was a victim of its own success, since it helped nudge forward the concept of the connected home to what it is today.
Daniel Rausch, an Amazon vice president who helped grow the Dash program from its start, said that back in early 2015, when the Dash button first came out, there were far fewer options for connected home gadgets. Amazon workers were trying to figure out a way ""to make shopping disappear"" for grocery list items like paper towels and printer ink and whatever else is pretty not-fun to go out and buy, Rausch said.
They landed on Dash buttons as a speedy jury-rig to add a bit of internet connectivity to an appliance that didn't have it, like throwing a Dash button for laundry detergent on your washing machine.
People seemed to like these goofy little buttons, which Amazon offered for $5 each up front, reimbursing that money after the first purchase using the button. Brands liked them as a way of reinforcing customer loyalty and affixing mini ads for their wares in people's bathrooms and linen closets.
Over the past four years, Amazon has created dozens of Dash buttons for items including Soylent meal replacement drinks, Schiff Glucosamine joint supplements and Slim Jims. The company shipped millions of these tiny buttons. Rausch said the most popular Dash buttons were for necessities that folks run out of a lot, like paper towels, toilet paper and bottled water. Other less predictable hits included items that required trips to specialty stores (pet food) or were annoying to find (printer ink) or a little embarrassing to buy in a store (condoms).
""Dash button was an awesome stepping stone into the world of connected home,"" Rausch said, later adding, ""We never imagined a future where customers had 500 buttons in their home. We imagined a future where the home was taking care of itself, including replenishing everyday items that customers would rather not worry about.""
The Dash button isn't nearly as necessary as it used to be. Today, plenty more appliances connect to the internet. Amazon also integrated its Dash Replenishment Service into hundreds of products from major manufacturers like Whirlpool and Samsung worldwide. DRS lets appliances automatically reorder the stuff they need, like a printer purchasing new ink. No need to even push a button.
Plus, Amazon created virtual Dash buttons on its website and developed voice shopping through its Alexa voice assistant, which have both grown in popularity, Amazon says.
There's no need to cry over the demise of Dash buttons. Instead, the next time you reorder bread via voice from your toaster (that's a thing now, right?), you can quietly thank Dash buttons for encouraging the creation of more smart-home gear.
""There's no doubt,"" Rausch said, ""that that core mission of Dash buttons succeeded.""",Who needs Dash buttons when your printer buys its own ink now.,2019-02-28T22:00:01Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}","Amazon stops selling Dash buttons, goofy forerunners of the connected home - CNET",https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-stops-selling-dash-buttons-goofy-forerunners-of-connected-home/,https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/mDlkQfTVDXIIcjklZonw-ESzmtU=/724x407/2017/05/04/dc36ff40-6af9-4dfa-8fb6-232068ee5aad/amazon-dash.jpg,,Cnet.com,whirlpool,1
Gia Liu,"As front-load washing machines have become popular, top load washers are not as easy to find these days. But there are still a few on the market. While experts say that front-loading machines are more energy efficient and get your clothes cleaner, top-load washers eliminate the need to bend over to put clothes in and are usually more affordable, making them preferable for many. Some top-load washers still use agitators to clean your clothing — that’s the post in the middle of the tub — and some have fins or paddles to help circulate the clothes. Other top-load washers use impellers, which are like smaller agitators that create currents to churn the clothing around in the tub. If you’re firmly on #teamtoploader, we’ve rounded up the best top-load washing machines on the market, at different price points, so you can make an informed decision. Samsung WA50M7450AW ($660+) This Samsung washing machine offers great value. The 5.0-cubic-foot washer is large enough that you can wash your entire family’s laundry in one go, even doing large loads of towels or sheets with no problem. There are also 11 wash cycles to choose from, including bedding, deep wash, and active wear. You can also customize the temperature, soil level, and spin speed for the cycle. While this model doesn’t include the additional cycles and options, such as sanitizing or allergy, it includes all the essential functions that most households will need. But because of this washer’s generous size, users who are on the shorter side may have trouble fishing out clothing from the bottom of the tub. If you find it challenging to reach articles of clothing in the washer, try using a stool or some tongs. Buy one now from: Best Buy Home Depot LG Electronics WT7200CW ($769+) This energy-efficient model is certified by Energy Star to meet or exceed federal guidelines of energy efficiency, thus conserving electricity while saving you money. It utilizes six different wash motions to get your clothing clean while ensuring no amount of water gets wasted. The SenseClean system detects how much laundry is in your load and automatically sets the right water level and wash time. This model is also packed with tons of other unique features that make the washer easy to use. The anti-vibration system reduces noise, so you don’t have to listen to constant clanging while the washer is on. The washer features a StainCare option that is specifically designed to tackle different types of stains. Let’s face it, some ketchup stains just won’t come off until you bring out the big guns. The NeveRust wash tub is comprised of stainless steel, and there are no sharp corners that can cause your clothing to snag. For peace of mind, the drum comes with lifetime warranty. With this model’s smart technology, you can use your smartphone to monitor or stop a laundry load anytime, from anywhere. Buy one now from: Home Depot Whirlpool WTW5000DW ($689+) One of the most energy-efficient top-load washers on the market right now is this one from Whirlpool. This model utilizes a low-profile impeller that is gentle on clothing while using no more than the right water amount for each load of laundry. A built-in sensor automatically detects the size of the load and fills the tub with water accordingly. The impeller works to steer clothing toward the center of the tub, as this is where clothing is cleaned most effectively. By maximizing efficiency, the impeller also allows the machine to use less water and doesn’t cause the wear-and-tear to your clothing that some agitators can produce. There are 12 cleaning cycles to choose from, so you have a wide range of options when it comes to customizing this machine for each load of laundry. If you’re looking for a machine that won’t produce a sky-high water bill and conserves water, look no further than this model. Buy one now from: Home Depot Whirlpool Maytag MVWB955FC ($1259+) If you have a large family or frequently host large groups of house guests, or if you only want to do laundry once every few weeks, you’ll want a large washing machine that can handle all the laundry people will inevitably have to do. This 6.2-cubic-foot model can handle massive loads, and you can choose from up to 10 different cycles depending on your laundry needs. Got super tough stains to get out? The PowerWash cycle makes this machine perfect for getting red wine stains off the tablecloth or mud markings off the door mat. The large size of the washer does come at a price though, so buyers should be prepared to pay a four-digit figure. Before taking the plunge and purchasing this Maytag model, be sure to measure your laundry room to ensure you have the space for it. It is mammoth-sized, after all. Buy one now from: Home Depot Best Buy GE Smart Top Load Washer with Wi-Fi ($798) If you’re looking for a smart washing machine that responds to voice commands and that you can control wirelessly from a smartphone, this GE model is one to consider. You probably know what it feels like to forget to transfer a fresh load of laundry from the washer to the dryer, but that won’t happen with this model; you’ll get reminders and alerts letting you know when the load is done or when you haven’t removed the washed clothing from the machine. The machine features a convenient water station, which gives you the option to pre-wash especially dirty clothing in a faucet with water and detergent. You’ll never forget to put the laundry detergent in, as this model automatically dispenses it for you. It also offers a speed wash setting, which will get your lightly soiled clothing items completely clean if you need them in a rush. Plus, the washer is EnergyStar-certified, making it a green and energy-efficient addition to your home.

Ry Crist,"The Trump administration has singled out foreign-based manufacturers of washing machines and solar panels, with new tariffs aimed at leveling the playing field for domestic producers. The announcement, released late Monday from the office of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, documents the findings and recommendations of the US International Trade Commission (ITC) following a pair of investigations launched under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. The first follows complaints from US-based manufacturer Whirlpool against Korean-based manufacturers Samsung and LG, each a relatively recent insurgent into the US appliances market. The ITC's report makes no specific claims of wrongdoing, but dubs Samsung and LG as ""a substantial cause of serious injury"" against domestic manufacturers, citing the ITC's investigation as well as a public hearing conducted by Lighthizer earlier this month. Samsung calls the new tariffs ""a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine."" Tyler Lizenby/CNET The result: fresh tariffs issued by President Trump -- specifically, a 20 percent tariff on the first 1.2 million washing machines imported in year one, with that number jumping to 50 percent for all subsequent imports. Both numbers decrease in years two and three, settling at 16 and 40 percent, respectively. ""Today's announcement is a great loss for American consumers and workers,"" a Samsung spokesperson tells CNET. ""This tariff is a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine. Everyone will pay more, with fewer choices."" ""Samsung greatly appreciates the support of the many South Carolina and other officials who have advocated on our behalf. We already have hired more than 600 U.S. workers at our new South Carolina factory, and we began U.S. production of our high-quality washing machines on January 12th. Consumers are choosing Samsung premium washing machines for their innovation and design."" The second investigation started after a 2017 petition from Suniva and SolarWorld, two solar manufacturers based out of China and Germany, respectively. Each claim that unfair business practices from low-cost competitors based in China caused harm to their sales. The ITC agreed with them. Its report cites the recent spike in domestic solar generation capacity, which it claims has been partly spurred by artificially low-priced units from China. In 2011, the report says, the US Commerce Department determined that Chinese solar cell producers were selling their wares in the US for less than their fair market value -- from there, the report claims that they evaded the resulting antidumping duties using loopholes, including relocating their facilities to Taiwan, and then to other countries like Germany and Korea. Again, the ITC determined that these factors and others constituted a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic solar industry. In response, President Trump authorized new, additional safeguard tariffs of 30 percent, excluding the first 2.5 gigawatt of imported cells. That number is scheduled to drop each year before settling at 15 percent in year four. Kevin Steinberger, policy analyst, Climate and Clean Energy Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the decision ""shortsighted and counterproductive,"" and issued the following statement: ""The cost of generating solar energy from rooftop panels has plummeted by more than 85 percent in less than a decade, but President Trump's action will reverse that progress. Higher-priced panels will dramatically reduce the pace of new solar energy installations, increase climate-changing emissions, and lead to significant job losses nationwide."" LG did not have an immediate response to our request for comment.","Along with Chinese-made solar panels, the announcement singles out Samsung and LG as ""substantial causes of serious injury"" against US manufacturers.",2018-01-22T23:36:26Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Trump issues new tariffs on imported washers and solar panels - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/trump-issues-new-tariffs-on-imported-washers-and-solar-panels/,https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/P2zQSxz4ue5JQlpZIW7XXVkLfhw=/670x503/2017/08/30/12e9563d-18bb-4b4e-8b25-2423bd5eba44/samsung-quick-wash-product-photos-2.jpg,,Cnet.com,whirlpool,1
Keely Khoury,"ga('send', 'event', 'Eco &amp; Sustainability', 'article', 'article-industry-impression', {nonInteraction: true});ga('send', 'event', 'Energy', 'article', 'article-industry-impression', {nonInteraction: true}); Turbulent’s goal is to provide sustainable energy for remote communities in a manner that causes no harm to the environment. Using the constancy of the flow of water as the power source, Turbulent’s hydropower generators work around-the-clock. With only one moving part, maintenance costs are minimal. Installation is relatively easy, with many locations generating power within a week. The deep drop structures created by controversial damming projects often alter the course of the water’s path. The Belgian team’s design, on the other hand, requires only a 1.5 meter height difference to work. Placement of the turbines in the correct location in turn becomes easier to find while also helping to keep additional construction to a minimum. The flow of the water creates a vortex that turns the rotor that extracts the energy from the water. The small pressure required for the movement of the turbine allows for the construction of the system in areas of fairly shallow, slow-moving water. The Turbulent team is keen to point out what differentiates their system from commercial hydropower constructions. Crucially, the Turbulent design allows fish and other animal life to pass through the turbine unhurt. Five kilowatts are currently available for small communities. However, the capacity of the turbine is being expanded to allow for 15, 30 and 100 kilowatts of energy output. The team asks that anyone interested in the system to get in touch to discuss the specifics of the task and location. Obviously, should the water freeze over, the energy supply will stop. And that reliance on weather remains one of the main challenges to the worldwide adoption of sustainable energy. Two ways those problems have been overcome is through application of a new material and a combination of sustainable energy sources. Graphene-coated solar cells allow for the production of electricity from rain, and in Germany, the world’s first integrated wind-hydro power plant allows for the production of energy in all weather conditions. How else could smaller scale builds help improve problematic areas of sustainable energy production?",New Belgian energy company uses a simple turbine construction to create round-the-clock water-powered electricity for remote communities without harming the environment.

Kim Wetzel,"Dan Baker/Digital Trends The other day I overheard a coworker in our office chastise another coworker for putting a knife sharp side up in the office dishwasher silverware caddy. “It’s a safety hazard!” First colleague informed second colleague, who lowered her head in shame. The comment ignited a heated debate in the office kitchen: silverware handles up or down? “Definitely down,” noted one coworker. “It gets them cleaner.” “You’re crazy,” responded the other. “Definitely handles up! That way, when you grab the fork, you aren’t touching the part that people put in their mouths!” I have to admit that I agree with coworker two. Growing up, I was taught that handles should be up so that the forks and spoons are closer to the jets on the bottom of the dishwasher and so you don’t stab yourself in the hand when retrieving your fork. Plus, when you pull the silverware out, you aren’t putting your grubby paws on the part of the silverware that someone is eventually going to stuff into their mouth. My husband has always been firmly on Team #HandlesUp as well, so I’ve lived pretty much my whole life thinking I was loading the dishwasher properly. Throughout my working career, I’d silently shake my head at fork prongs sticking up in office dishwashers. “Amateurs,” I would think to myself. There are 2 types of people: 1. Those who load silverware into the dishwasher w/handles up. 2. Maniacs who don&amp;#39;t. &amp;mdash; Beau Coffron (@lunchboxdad) June 23, 2016 But my colleagues’ conversation got me thinking. Maybe I’m the amateur at loading the dishwasher. And as Home Editor at Digital Trends who’s in charge of appliance reviews, I figured it was a question I should know the answer to. So, I decided to do a little research, as well as ask some people who actually know a thing or two about dishwashers — appliance manufacturers — to get the answer to this age-old question once and for all. Is it handles up, or handles down? It turns out, the answer to the question depends on who you ask — and who’s using the dishwasher. Knife tips down I reached out to Samsung, LG, Whirlpool, GE Appliances, and Kenmore to get some answers. In my quest for knowledge, I was fully expecting to validate my way of doing things. “Unless you live life on the edge, place handles going up to avoid the sharp edges.” Unfortunately, that’s not what happened. Turns out, there’s not really across-the-board agreement on proper etiquette — except everyone agrees that loading or unloading the dishwasher should not lead to accidental stabbings. In other words, the sharp end of a knife should be down with the handle up. “Unless you live life on the edge, place handles going up to avoid the sharp edges,” Taryn Brucia, director of public relations for LG Electronics, told Digital Trends. Mike Nerdig, senior commercial director of dishwashers at GE Appliances, says handles up for knives and forks to prevent accidental stabbings, but handles down for spoons. He also offered a few other nuggets of proper loading etiquette I hadn’t thought about: “For best washing, place your flatware in the removable silverware baskets,” Nerdig told Digital Trends. “Avoid letting your spoons, and all other silverware, well, spoon. Letting items clump and nest together will keep them from being properly washed.” Dan Baker/Digital Trends A Samsung spokesperson told me that while you should always look at your dishwasher manual first, for the most part, all silverware should be placed in the dishwasher handles down, sharp edges or not. Both Kenmore and Whirlpool agreed with the knife handles up, rest of handles down for best cleaning. Whirlpool Corporation’s Institute of Home Science also recommended checking on whether any knives other than butter knives should even go in the dishwasher before throwing them in there. Have I been doing it wrong? Not so fast. So … with the exception of GE Appliances, most dishwasher manufacturers essentially told me that I’ve been loading the dishwasher wrong all these years. But it turns out that not everyone agrees with the handles down rule all the time. For maximum cleaning efficiency, it should be a combination of both handles up and down so that eating utensils don’t nest together. Electrolux says that for maximum cleaning efficiency, it should be a combination of both handles up and down so that eating utensils don’t nest together. And according to Leslie Reichert, a “cleaning coach” with a big following on Facebook, you should go ahead and put those handles up, especially when kids are involved. “I recommend this if you are having your children learn to empty the dishwasher, or you really want to avoid transferring germs from your hands to the eating surfaces of the silverware,” she told Reader’s Digest. So what’s the verdict? While I started this journey hoping for a clear answer (and let’s be honest — to validate my way of doing things), what I’ve found instead is less clarity on than ever. Handles up, handles down, what does it all mean for humanity? I have a four-year-old who is learning household chores. I’m positive that, while I ask him to wash his hands frequently, his cute little paws are grubby with germs. I don’t want him putting a thumbprint on the spoon I’m going to use for dinner. So that means I’m going to continue doing things the way I do them: handles up. I’d also say that if you’re a handles down person, well, good for you. Keep on rockin’ in the free world. Just don’t get mad at me at the office when I put that spoon in the dishwasher with the handle up. You know, out of habit. Because depending on who you ask, we’re both doing it correctly. And honestly, I’m just glad we’re all loading the dishwasher rather than throwing stuff in the sink.","Everyone has their own way of loading a dishwasher. But who’s doing it correctly, those on #TeamHandlesUp or #TeamHandlesDown? We asked some experts to get the question answered once and for all.

Kenya Foy,"Germany-based company Caravanboat has the solution to the common vacation conundrum that plagues many trip planners: Whether to hit the high seas or remain on land. The Departure One, a 30-foot camper, is capable of being used on the water or on solid ground. Fashioned out of seawater-resistant aluminum, the multi-purpose dwelling is a crafty combination of a camper and a motorized houseboat. The air-conditioned space has a living room, a small shower, sink, and toilet. The kitchen is equipped with plenty of amenities including a microwave, refrigerator, stovetop, and storage space. A seating area in the living room doubles as a bed, plus two additional singles that allow the camper to sleep a total of four guests. Additionally, the caravan features panoramic windows and a fixed roof terrace with solar power that provides unobstructed views of the surrounding landscape. An extra bonus: the camper-boat combo has off-the-grid capabilities. It can accommodate two guests for up to two days without additional water or electricity, and it can be transported by truck, car trailer, or flat rack container. Departure One comes in a variety of colors and has a starting price point of $67,448. Unfortunately, it's not available in the U.S. at the moment, but with all the campers available, it's hardly the only amphibious option out there. The Germany-produced Sealander made quite the splash when it hit the market a few years back. Although it's tiny with a mere 13 square feet of interior space, the plus side is that it's economically priced. Then there's the considerably more expensive (but uber cool) Terra Wind RV that comes with an 8-jet whirlpool tub, marble flooring, all major appliances, and more. With so many options, these camper-meets-boat vehicles are clearly the way to vacation.","Germany-based company Caravanboat has the solution to the common vacation conundrum that plagues many trip planners: Whether to hit the high seas or remain on land.

Amy Held,"The ice disk is seen spinning on the Presumpscot River in drone video image provided by the City of Westbrook, Maine.
Tina Radel/AP
There is more than just January's cold currently gripping the city of Westbrook, Maine. An immense icy disk doing a solitary pirouette on the Presumpscot River is dazzling observers, local and distant, alike.
Scientists say the disk is naturally occurring and has been seen before. Most of us have spotted eddies in flowing water, that is when a cross current creates a small whirlpool. But winter's cold adds a whiff of mystery to this phenomenon. 
Paul Nakroshis, an associate professor of physics at the University of Southern Maine, tells Maine Public Radio that the formation of the ice disks is not totally understood. 
""It's probably formed and this is speculation by the aggregation of small little bits of ice or in an initial big chunk of ice that, because of initial rotation, little pieces of ice glob onto it,"" Nakroshis said. 
As for why it rotates, Nakroshis says researchers have found melting ice sinks causing a vortex that can turn the disk.
""However,"" he adds, ""the water in the Westbrook river is not actually warm enough to cause the effect... So most likely the cause of the rotation is just the river water going by the disk and once it starts rotating in that direction it's probably going to continue."" 
His best guess for how fast it is spinning is based on study of another ice disk that formed in a New York river in the late 19th Century, which did a whole rotation in about six minutes. 
The Portland Press Herald reports that the Presumpscot River ice measures about 100 yards across and is serving as a water cooler topic for area workers.
Rob Mitchell has a bird's eye view from his riverside office building and told the Herald he saw ducks resting on it Monday. 
""The ducks were rotating on this big Lazy Susan,"" he said. ""It was a big duck-go-round."" 
It may be terra firma for birds, but for people this disk is best seen and not stood or skated on. Nakroshis tells Maine Public Radio that a person could fall through.
The city of Westbrook is taking a more celestial view of things on its Twitter account. 
""It looks like the moon has landed in Westbrook, Maine!,"" it tweeted. 
The city, located about seven miles west of Portland with a population of fewer than 20,000, is basking in the sudden media glare. Good Morning America did a feature from its river banks. And Westbrook's homegrown star is piquing interest across the pond. 
The city is hoping the frozen phenomenon will lure in visitors, before the inevitable warmer temperatures force them to let it go.","Whether reminiscent of the moon's surface or ""a big duck-go-round,"" a circle of ice entrances as it bobs and spins on a river in Maine.",2019-01-16T17:22:59Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","A Massive Moving Ice Disk Takes Center Stage, Mesmerizing Maine",https://www.npr.org/2019/01/16/685816019/a-massive-moving-ice-disk-takes-center-stage-mesmerizing-maine,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/16/ap_19015592921843_wide-aa94f24b196ea0caa4859955ca4bf47d22948527.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,whirlpool,1

Tara Bellucci,"It's been a whirlwind romance for pop star Ariana Grande and SNL's Pete Davidson. The young couple have only been public with their relationship since late May, and now the two are engaged and reportedly living together. Where, you ask? The luxe Chelsea high-rise designed by none other than Zaha Hadid. TMZ reported Wednesday that the pair have moved into a five bedroom, four and a half bath unit in the new residential building worth $16 million. After Ariana's $93K engagement ring, there's no reason to skimp on their pad. While no specific listing is named by TMZ's sources, NYC real estate website StreetEasy surmises it's a ""sponsor unit"" on the 17th floor that came off the market just nine days ago—a timeline that fits with Ariana's Insta Story about moving in together last weekend (she posted a Spongebob meme ). For those unfamiliar with the term, a sponsor unit is a residence that has been owned by the developer or original owner that is for sale for the first time. There are usually special terms for purchasing a sponsor unit, like the ability to bypass a co-op board, or have the potential for a lower down payment, among other things. StreetEasy guesses the couple might be renting the unit—located directly over the High Line in Chelsea—which features a 1,361 square foot terrace with views of the Empire State Building. Grande and Davidson could potentially run into their new neighbor, Sting, in the building's private IMAX theater, or on the ""wellness level"" which boasts a ""75-foot saline system sunlight-infused swimming pool, fitness center, reservable private spa suite with sauna, steam room, whirlpool, cold plunge, waterfall showers and massage beds.""

Steve Cody,"I co-founded my firm 22 years ago. We began with nothing: No clients, no prospects, and no real business plan. But because we were willing to roll the dice and do the unexpected, we landed two major accounts in our early years that not only assured our subsequent success, but put our name firmly on the map as a serious contender to existing PR firms. I'll begin with my tip and turn it over to one of our clients, Anisa Telwar Kaicker, who will provide four other surefire ways to get the big names to roll the dice and hire your virtually unknown firm. Since it's my column, I get to go first: 1.) Be fearless On the few occasions we had the opportunity to pitch a huge prospect, we threw caution to the wind and presented ideas that were beyond extreme, believing it was the only way to beat our larger competitors. Two quick examples: When we were invited to pitch GE's Imagination at Work campaign, I decided we should create a third political party, bring Thomas Edison back to life, and nominate him our candidate. His campaign promise? Reinvigorate imagination in America. I had one of our underlings dress up as Edison and announce his candidacy in front of the prospects. We then rolled out the grassroots campaign we'd employ to heighten awareness of the overall Imagination at work program. We were hired on the spot. A few years later, we were invited to pitch Whirlpool. Once again, we were a virtually unknown underdog and once again, I threw caution to the wind. I marched into the presentation room, tossed one of my multiple mismatched socks at each decision-maker and asked, ""Where do these poor socks' mates go? Sock heaven? Are they living on some remote South Pacific Island? Why are there so many mismatched socks? Our team then rolled out a grassroots campaign in which we'd ask consumers to conjecture on the plight of their missing socks and position Whirlpool at the one appliance maker that would pledge money to find and reunite the original pair of socks. The CMO stopped us midway through our presentation, and said, ""You had me at Sock Heaven. You're hired."" And now, here are Anisa's four tips. Anisa is founder &amp; CEO of Anisa International ( http://anisa.com ), a trusted partner to the biggest names in beauty that creates some of the best cosmetic brushes in the business. She grew her firm from zero to $50 million in 25 years by showing the same type of bravado I mentioned above. Here are her four tips for outflanking your competition. 2.) Be transparent Simply put, as entrepreneurs we don't get every single thing right every single time. Neither do clients. The best partners act as a mirror. Honesty and transparency build trust, and trust leads to respect. If you can establish this credibility and confidence with a prospect in your first meeting, it will serve you well. 3.) Believe in yourself I was not a natural salesperson when I first started my business, but I drew from my strengths, leveraged other resources, and I improved over time. The sooner you find your confidence, the better you'll be at closing a sale. It's imperative, especially when meeting a prospect for the first time. 4.) Know their business Any constructive industry partnership is built on shared, authentic understanding. Our employees share an unstoppable dedication to identifying--and satisfying--unmet consumer cosmetic needs for our prospects and customers. In many ways, our clients' pain points become our pain points. What we've found is that this kind of thoughtfulness and determination is hard to say 'no' to, especially in an initial meeting. 5.) Focus on the 'Why' I started my business because I wanted to guide women in finding confidence through cosmetics. It's my 'why'--my passion--­and it shows in the 'how' (my work). This kind of drive is not only contagious, it's very persuasive to prospects. What's more, it helps you as an entrepreneur determine the right partners. We're keen to work with collaborators with whom we connect and will let us share the products that we're so passionate about. If our core beliefs don't align, then it's probably better to walk away. Rolling the dice and taking risks is what separates the great entrepreneur from the mediocre one. It's also what will enable you to succeed in convincing that one big prospect to become your first huge customer.",Useful tips to go from complete anonymity to industry superstar.,2017-11-27T18:11:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",How to Get Big-Name Clients to Hire Your No-Name Company,https://www.inc.com/steve-cody/how-to-turn-big-prospects-into-huge-customers.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_524716402_332953.jpg,,Inc.com,whirlpool,1
Rich Brown,"Google owned this one. No question. 
Yes, Google spent a ton on marketing. Its booth in the parking lot of the Las Vegas Convention Center was bigger than most houses. It had a roller coaster (kind of; it was really more of a flat ""ride""). And Google back all the style with substance, demoing Google Assistant voice services far ahead of the competition and announcing a startling number of connected devices that work with its products. 
Beyond Google's dominance, smaller smart home sub-categories bloomed at CES, including GE's C by GE smart lights and Whirlpool and its Yummly- and Google-powered connected kitchen products. With increased competition, and forward movement for certain categories, the smart home is no longer about gawking at the fact that you can control your lights with an app. The smart home appears to have grown up some.
In order of importance, here's what we saw that stood out the most. 
Google Assistant Interpreter mode and Google Assistant Connect
Google Assistant's Interpreter mode is a great example of how deep experience in machine learning and natural language processing can pay off. International travelers may be the first to encounter Interpreter, since Google is piloting it at hotel concierge desks. With Interpreter, a Google Smart Display and eventually an Android phone can act as a translation tool for two people who need to carry on a conversation but don't speak the same language. Right now, Interpreter can translate 27 different languages and not only shows the conversation on the screen, but the Assistant itself actually says both parts of the conversation out loud. 
You can read the full hands-on conducted by my colleague Rich Nieva. Despite a few bumps, Google Interpreter Mode feels remarkably useful. It also looks like a sharp poke in the eye to Amazon's competing Alexa voice service. (Alexa can only speak three languages right now, English, German, and Japanese, along with a handful of English dialects.) Amazon has a learning tool called Cleo to help Alexa add more languages, but Google launching Interpreter mode highlights a discrete edge for Assistant as an all-purpose service.
Google also laid the groundwork for an answer to Amazon's avalanche of device announcements this past Fall. Google Assistant Connect is essentially a chip for third party device makers to add basic Google Assistant connectivity to their devices. As examples, Google demonstrated a concept, credit card-style e-Ink display that showed basic time, weather, and traffic information, provided by a direct connection to a nearby Google Home speaker. It also showed a mock-up of a smart button you could tie to a Google Home speaker to which you had associated a set of smart lights. The button itself doesn't ping Google's cloud service, but by pressing it, it sends the on/off command request to the Google Home device that does.
Think of Google Assistant Connect as the Google equivalent to Amazon's Alexa Gadgets Toolkit. Amazon's Echo Wall Clock is a product of that kit. The Clock doesn't have an Alexa speaker built in, but instead sets the time and displays Alexa timers via data provided by its connection to an Echo speaker. Both kits enable developers to come to market with creative, lightweight products that can be either fun or useful to consumers, and also extend the reach of their respective voice platforms. I expect Google's annual developer showcase, Google I/O, will have a deluge of new Google Assistant gadgets, similar to Amazon's event last year.

Whirlpool Connected Kitchen
I love cooking, and it's hard to imagine bringing more technology into my kitchen, but the KitchenAid Smart Display from Whirlpool is something I'd consider. That alone makes it notable. 
It's essentially the same as the other Google Smart Displays from Google and its partners that launched last year, with the addition of a splash-resistant coating, and integration with Yummly, a recipe recommendation and cooking walkthrough app Whirlpool is rolling out across kitchen products from the Smart Display to a full-sized wall oven. 
What makes the KitchenAid Smart Display compelling is that it piggybacks off the strong foundation of Google Assistant and the other Google-powered smart displays, which are already good at walking you through a recipe. The splash resistance is a thoughtful improvement, and if you like Yummly and decide you want to go deeper into Whirlpool's smart kitchen universe, the app maintains continuity with other Whirlpool products, letting you tee up cook time and temperature from the display.

Of the other products, the wall oven in particular is an example of the goofiest impulses of smart kitchen, but that's okay. It's only a concept, and it's exactly the kind of thing that drums up hype at CES. Instead of a traditional glass viewing window, the Whirlpool Connected Hub Wall Oven has a transparent AR display. It will show you recipe steps from the Yummly service, or a rendering of whatever dish you're making. A camera above the screen tracks your head movements, which then prompt the meal rendering to move on the screen, so you can see multiple sides of it. 
I'm intrigued with another concept from the show: the WLabs Smart Countertop Oven. A competitor to connected countertop ovens from June, Brava, and others, the WLabs model has food identification technology that can identify food you put into it and then automatically set cook time and temperature. That's a lot like June's oven, but Whirlpool has more heating elements in its version, which the company says will result in more even cooking and more cook mode options. This one will actually become available to consumers. 
Whirlpool says it's offering 2,000 units in a test run this spring for $800. This kind of appliance isn't for everyone, but we liked the June oven for what it was when we reviewed it last year. With serious competition in this space, someone may eventually get it right at a price more people can afford.

C by GE Lighting products
The best thing about the GE smart lighting line expansion is it gives real competition to Philips Hue due to the breadth of GE's device line-up. With three new smart bulbs, five new smart light switches, a smart power outlet (for lamps) and a smart motion detector to let you trigger some automations, you can now outfit the lighting scheme of an entire home with GE hardware. 
GE's pricing is competitive with the equivalent products from Philips, and like Philips, the GE kit works with the three major smart home voice assistants, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. Philips still has more bulb options than GE, but with color-changing  A19 and BR30 floodlight bulbs (it already had all-white models), GE hits the two most important bulb designs for residential use. This hardware will roll at a steady pace this year, with two dimmer switches coming to stores in Q1 2019.

Netatmo Smart Video Doorbell
We saw multiple video doorbells at this year's show, including a new peephole design from Ring. That's a clever design, but the Netatmo Smart Video Doorbell earned our admiration as the first video doorbell to work with Apple's HomeKit smart home platform, and for the fact that unlike competing doorbells, Netatmo offers a lot of its accompanying services for free.
Where August, Nest, Ring, and others charge for video storage and person detection, the Netatmo bell comes with a microSD card for local storage, as well as the ability to store clips on DropBox or on an FTP server. You can also view those clips via the Netatmo app. Person detection, and the ability to outline specific motion monitoring zones in the camera's field of view are also free. All of that usually requires a monthly subscription service fee. Here, they're free. Pricing is still TBD, but you'll see Netatmo's doorbell in stores in the second half of 2019.

Lenovo Smart Clock
The Lenovo Smart Clock is similar to Amazon's Echo Spot bedside smart display, but with one major exception. No camera. That alone is reason enough to like this thing. 
The Smart Clock includes Google Assistant, as well as a pared down version of Google's smart display interface designed only to show you information like traffic on your route to work, weather, calendar appointments, and maybe a video feed from a Google-connected smart camera. It can play music, but not video from any of the various streaming services, nor can it show pictures. 
The Smart Clock also has a unique snooze feature for its alarm. Smack the clock when the alarm goes off and it will go into snooze mode. You can also set it to trigger a ""good morning"" routine across your Google Assistant smart home devices once you dismiss the alarm. All of that is clever enough, but also notable is that this is yet another Google Assistant device aimed directly at an Amazon equivalent, and arguably doing it better. 
LaMetric Sky
Color-changing LED wall panels are perhaps the best novelty in the smart home category. Nanoleaf and LIFX have come to the show with triangular and square models before, LaMetric's design moves the concept forward.  
LaMetric is comprised of interlocking, triangular panels with built-in LEDs. Where most other panel design let you program one color per panel, each of LaMetric's panels is made of 32 smaller triangular portions, all of which you can set to a different color. The result is a beautiful stained-glass effect that you can hang on your wall. 
LaMetric hasn't put a price on Sky yet, nor even the number of panels that will come in a kit (probably 8). With all the complication that comes with linking devices together, privacy, or the fundamental debate around the benefits of smart home, it's refreshing to have a class of products that simply serve to look great on your wall. 
The smart home still has plenty of room to mature, and recent headlines have done the category no favors in its ongoing effort to prove that it deserves consumer trust. More competition will only help, and with at least some of the hardware mature enough to invite more and more services, it appears the smart home might have moved out of its infancy. The question for 2019 will be how it grows from here, and whether or not it can convince consumers to hang around to find out.

JIM TANKERSLEY,"Through the third quarter, Whirlpools unit sales were down 2.5 percent in North America, compared with the same period in its previous fiscal year. The companys executives said in an October earnings call that they expected to be hit by an additional $300 million in cost increases, largely driven by the steel tariff, in the year to come. 
A Whirlpool spokesman declined to comment, citing a company policy not to talk about continuing trade issues. But the company confirmed it did, in fact, add 200 employees in Ohio.
Mr. Trumps tariff rate on washing machines will drop two percentage points, to 18 percent, this year, which should mildly ease the pressure on companies and consumers. Retailers say they have seen signs that suggest the worst is over: Ted Decker, executive vice president for merchandising at Home Depot, told analysts in November that after several difficult months with washing machines, our laundry sales and unit productivity is on par, if not slightly better, than the average of our overall appliance business.
The three-month average for laundry equipment inflation peaked in July, at 20 percent. In December, that increase was just 1.6 percent. This makes sense, economically: Tariffs jolted prices upward, but the overall trend in the appliance industry remains downward. If your neighbor bought a new washer last June and you buy the same one this June, theres a decent chance it will be cheaper.
You might not even need to wait that long. Retail websites suggest that if you run out to your local appliance store this weekend, youre likely to find a bunch of washing machines, American made and imported,on sale.",President Trump placed a 20 percent tariff on imported washing machines to help domestic manufacturers like Whirlpool.

Rita El Khoury,"After seeing Google Assistant Smart Displays from Lenovo, JBL, LG, and Google, it's now time for another big electronics maker to join the fray: KitchenAid. Wait, what? OK, see, there's a simple explanation: KitchenAid is owned by Whirlpool. No, still doesn't make sense. Well, Ryne called the Lenovo Smart Display ""the best new kitchen appliance since the dishwasher"" and our best guess is KitchenAid read that and thought, "" Nah, we can do better.""
Alright, all jokes aside, this KitchenAid Smart Display makes sense in a way. Smart Displays have a real sense of purpose in the kitchen: timers, recipes, unit conversions, smart home controls, music while cooking or doing dishes, YouTube videos and tutorials, and a photo slideshow when not in use... If KitchenAid is making appliances for your kitchen, it's not a big leap to imagine it wanting that new potential spot on your countertop.
Details on the unit are sparse so far, but the press image shows a lean design, less focus on sound, and possibly no camera. We know it'll have a 10"" display, IPX5 water resistance (it's resistant to water splashes and jets, better than JBL's IPX4), use Android Things as its underlying platform, and have ""exclusive"" extra cooking content from Yummly. It'll let you see personalized recommendations, walk you through the recipe steps, and even includes a Pro tier with video guides.
It's this Yummly integration that piques my interest the most. I've been using Yummly on my tablet for over a year to browse, search, and categorize recipes. I love it and I've wanted access to it on my Lenovo Smart Display for a while. (I know I can ask Google Assistant for the recipe and hope to find it from the source site, but I can't browse or add to my Yummly from it).
The information we have now seems to indicate that the Yummly service will be exclusive to this KitchenAid display, though I have trouble figuring out how this could be possible if it's using Google Assistant — unless there's a way for manufacturers to customize their units with built-in apps or special content, which we haven't seen so far. I just want a Yummly Actions on Google service like Tasty's on my Smart Display and I'll be happy. One can hope.
You can expect the KitchenAid Smart Display to be available in the second half of the year and cost somewhere between $200 and $300.","After seeing Google Assistant Smart Displays from Lenovo, JBL, LG, and Google, it's now time for another big electronics maker to join the fray: KitchenAid.

Julie Muncy,"Sometimes, you just have to lean into it. And that was James Wans precise reaction when asked about Ocean to Ocean, Pitbulls interesting remix of Totos Africa. The song appears both on the soundtrack and in a moment in the film, and Wan has a pretty clear explanation as to why. 
[Putting] the song in the sequence where Aquaman and Mera walk out of the water in slow motion, I felt: For f-s sake, lets have fun with it! Its something out of Fast and Furious, he told Business Insider. He explained that Pitbull was signed on early for the film, and that his song fit perfectly with the sequence it was used in, which was very tongue-in-cheek, and we just wanted to have fun with it. And we wanted a cheeky song at that point of the movie. I just wasnt sure what song it was going to be.
Since its release, Pitbulls Ocean to Ocean has fascinated me. I have not enjoyed this song, but I have listened to it. Many times. It is both better and much worse than I would have guessed. Transfixing, like the deep black vortex of a whirlpool, and equally as dangerous. Its also deeply, blisteringly silly. Which is to say, James Wan is right. We should celebrate Ocean to Ocean.

Anne Riley Moffat,"As the Trump administration’s global trade war heats up, Whirlpool Corp. is feeling the burn. The maker of home appliances said rising raw material costs hurt results in three out of four of its regional markets in the second quarter, including North America, Asia and its struggling Europe, Middle East and Africa division. The only region where it didn’t cite input-cost inflation was in Latin America, which faced its own problems in the second quarter, including a Brazilian trucker strike. The higher raw material costs, paired with lower sales volumes and unfavorable foreign currency impacts, contributed to Whirlpool’s weaker-than-expected quarterly results. Net sales and ongoing earnings per share both missed analysts’ estimates in the three months ended June 30. The company’s ongoing full-year profit forecast missed the lowest estimate. Whirlpool shares fell as much as 9.3 percent in after-hours trading to $136.75. They have lost 11 percent this year. Whirlpool disclosed in its second-quarter presentation that raw-material inflation will cost the company about $350 million in 2018. That’s up from the $250 million to $300 million it predicted in April, and even that was $50 million higher than what it was forecasting back in January. Electrolux Sees Cost of Latest U.S. Trade Tariffs at $10 Million The company didn’t specify which raw materials were causing the headaches, though in April, it cited steel and resin as particular concerns. President Donald Trump in March placed a 25 percent tariff on imports of steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from most countries. The U.S. allowed some exemptions for South Korea, Brazil, Australia and Argentina. After initially exempting Canada, Mexico and the E.U., Trump extended the Section 232 tariffs in June to include those key trade allies. — With assistance by Joe Deaux","As the Trump administration’s global trade war heats up, Whirlpool Corp. is feeling the burn.",2018-07-23T21:16:23Z,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",Whirlpool Sinks With Raw Material Costs Climbing Around the World,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-23/whirlpool-sinks-as-raw-material-costs-climb-around-the-world,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ixm84.VZXA2A/v1/1200x800.jpg,bloomberg,Bloomberg,whirlpool,1

Tyler Lacoma,"The powerful convection oven has become a popular addition to the modern kitchen. These ovens (or oven modes) cycle heated air around food to cook it more quickly and add extra crispiness to certain dishes. There’s a variety of counter and built-in convection models around. Here’s a list of the best countertop and wall convection ovens on the market. You’ll find a variety of styles and prices on this list. Countertop models Breville BOV845BSS ($216) We’re big fans of Breville’s embrace of technology, which leads to some very unique, powerful designs and control systems. This oven, for example, has a large LED screen and a collection of dial-based controls instead of buttons. This allows Breville to offer speedy temperature and time settings, as well as a number of presets for general heating levels, including toast, roast, broiling, pizza, cookies, reheating, and so on. The 0.8 cubic foot interior isn’t incredibly large, but it’s big enough for most projects, including a 13-inch pizza. Plus, at 1800 watts, you get a lot of power as well as convection settings and a bright internal light that you can use to check on your food if you’re unsure about convection times. We do wish there were a couple more smart features, but this would raise the price even more. Buy now at: Amazon Cuisinart TOB-26ON1 ($206) This powerful Cuisinart model sets out to make really good toast—and then does everything else really well, too. There are separate settings for the number of toast slices and how brown you want your toast to be, and similar functions for pizzas and other foods. Presets include bagel, waffle, baking, broil, roasting, sandwich, and other unique options. The dual cooking system allows you to run two different cooking functions at different temperatures in case you don’t want the top of your dish to brown too fast. There’s also speed convection without preheating for quick projects. At 0.95 cubic feet, this is also one of the most spacious models on our list. Be careful, however: The MSRP for this model is actually $450, so it’s important to find deals like the one Amazon offers. Buy now at: Amazon KitchenAid KCO273SS ($180) This KitchenAid model is a more straightforward convection oven. It’s a bit smaller than our other top choices — big enough to fit a 12-inch pizza in and not much more — but it comes with that trademark KitchenAid durability, and it’s very easy to use. The nine presets include pizza, toast, cookies, bagels, and Asado Roast for tackling a variety of different foods. That stainless steel interior may look hard to clean, but it’s coated with a slick surface that makes it easier to wipe stray food bits off. If you don’t care much for fancy LED screens and just want dependable operation, this KitchenAid model is ready to be your friend. Buy now at: Amazon Black + Decker TO3280SSD ($100) You may be thinking, “Wow, these ovens are all too pricey for what I’m looking for,” in which case we introduce this B+D model for your consideration. It includes a 120-minute timer, enough room for a 12-inch pizza, and presets for baking, broiling, toast, pizza, frozen foods, and more. The controls are all simple, durable buttons that are easy to learn if you’ve never used a convection oven before. It’s only 1500 watts, but the convection function helps make up for less power range. The noted price is for the three-rack model. If you prefer two racks (the standard for most countertop convection ovens), then you can drop the price even further. Buy now at: Amazon NuWave 20632 Pro Plus ($120) While the design may seem a little odd, this style of convection oven is becoming increasingly popular for its excellent visibility and counter-friendly shape. It’s also larger than it looks and is able to hold a 16-pound turkey or a 14-pound ham, plus veggies or potatoes. The oven is particularly energy-efficient too, and can help you save a lot of electricity if you can regularly skip the oven in favor of this affordable cooker. Cooking options, however, are pretty limited: You get a warm, reheat, and delay timer, but that’s about it. If you have a little more money to spend, we suggest taking a look at some larger, more elaborate versions of these clear cookers. Find out more at: Amazon Wall oven models Frigidaire Gallery Collection 30-Inch Double Electric Oven ($1800) Need a convection wall oven instead? Frigidaire is known for its durable, kitchen-friendly ovens. This dual wall oven offers a ton of cooking space (around 9.2 cubic feet). Both oven compartments have bake, broil, warm and convection options, which come with delayed start and quick preheating to manage tricky meal times. Smart features like power broil and an included temperature probe also make cooking meats particularly easy. Keep in mind that while this 30-inch oven will fit in most traditional wall oven locations, it may need more vertical room than your old model. Find out more at: Amazon GE PK7000SFSS ($2400) This 4.3-cubic foot electric range model comes with a powerful European-style convection mode and basically every oven feature under the sun. There’s a 10-pass baking element, which is a heating element system designed to heat from 10 points at once for maximum coverage, and an eight-pass broiling mode that does much the same from the top. Other modes include warming, convection roasting, and convection baking. The onboard Wi-Fi features allow you to control and monitor the oven from your app, (via a hand remote button on the oven), or you can give the oven voice commands if your hands are deep in bread dough. Cleaning options includes a steam cleaning mode to avoid harsh chemicals too. Of course, all these features require some serious oven investment money. Buy now at: Home Depot GE Appliances Whirlpool WOS92EC0AS ($1850) An excellent single-oven model, the 5.0-cubic foot Whirlpool WOS92EC0AS offers high-end features like rapid preheating and, for the convection newcomers, a conversion feature that will automatically convert traditional recipes to convection temperatures and times (it still pays to be careful, however). Three racks of room is plenty for more kitchen activities, but there are very few modes and auto-cooking times beyond the conversion feature, so you have to do a little hands-on programming for this model. We especially like the steam cleaning option, which helps get crusty bits off the oven without using chemicals.

Jenny McGrath,"A friend recently said she’s considering buying a new dryer, since hers is making a thunking sound. When asked if she has a gas or electric dryer, she scrunched up her face and shrugged. If you’re not poking around behind your appliance, you might not know what’s going on inside it. But if you are going to purchase a new dryer, you need to know what you’re looking for. Just because you have a gas hookup doesn’t mean you have to use it. On the other hand, if you’re not set up for gas and don’t want to go through a whole installation process, electric is your only option. Given the choice, though, is one really better than the other? How can you tell? An electric and gas dryer outlet, on the left and right, respectively. Jenny McGrath / Digital Trends If you just moved into a new place with a washer and dryer hookup but no appliance, you can tell by the outlet. Gas dryers run on electricity to do things like power the lights and turn the drum, but heat with gas. The outlet should look pretty typical, and there will be a capped off gas line in the vicinity. If the outlet is larger — it may have three or four holes for prongs — and you don’t see a gas line, chances are you’ve got an electric setup, which runs on 240 volts. You can snap a picture of the outlet and bring it with you to the appliance store, and they should be able to confirm for you. For those of you who have an existing dryer, you can always check out the model number. Gas dryers usually have a “G” somewhere in the jumble of letters, while electric ones have an “E.” This isn’t necessarily foolproof, though. Whirlpool makes a dryer with the model number WGD4815EW, which has both and “E” and a “G.” However, the electric version has two “E’s” in its number: WED4815EW. How they heat Both types use heat, air, and tumbling to get your clothes dry. The airflow and tumbling go hand-in-hand. While electric dryers use a heating element, gas dryers have a gas burner. In the former, an electric current travels through the heating coil, building up electrons and heating up the metal and in turn, the air. The heated air is then sent into the drum via a blower or fan. Using natural gas or propane, gas dryers use an ignitor to burn the gas. As with the electric version, a blower or fan draws the hot air into the drum. How about a vent? Both electric and gas dryers get vented to the outside, thanks to the moist, lint-filled air they expel. Otherwise, you could find yourself with a mildewy basement, not to mention lots of particulates in the air. In addition, the vent on a gas dryer exhausts out the products of combustion, which you also don’t want to breathe. Ventless electric models are often found in apartments because they don’t need to exhaust the air outside. Many of these models are compact, but Whirlpool makes a full-size ventless dryer, the Duet. There are two types of ventless dryers: condenser and heat pump, and they work a little differently. In the first, the air is heated by a condenser and then travels to the drum and starts evaporating the water from the wet clothes. Air returns to the condenser for a cool down, and while the moisture condenses, the air gets reheated and returns to the drum to start the cycle over again. One thing to keep in mind is that if you don’t have a drain to divert the condensed water, it will collect in a tray you’ll need to empty after each use. Heat pumps use a refrigerator-like compressor technology, recirculates air, and removes moisture from the clothes and air. It uses lower temperatures than conventional dryers, so it’s gentler on clothes. These dryers are more efficient energy-wise — the heat pump is the most efficient — but their cycles take longer than their vented counterparts. For example, the Electrolux EIED200QSW ventless condenser dryer’s normal cycle starts off at an hour and 44 minutes and will vary based on whether the sensors continue to detect moisture from the laundry. The company’s full-size EFME617STT dries clothes in under an hour using the normal cycle, so it’s a pretty substantial difference. Still, if your condo doesn’t have the conventional laundry hookups, it’s the only way to go. How much does it cost? Up front, you’re going to pay around $50 to $100 more for a gas dryer, not to mention the installation cost, which could run you around $150 to $200, says Steve Sheinkopf, CEO of Yale Appliances and writer of the Yale Appliance Blog. Gas dryers are more energy efficient in the long run, according to Energy Star, though that may depend on rates in your area. However, front-load washers spin three times as fast as they did in the early ’80s, meaning clothes aren’t as wet going into the dryer, Sheinkopf points out. There are now Energy Star-certified dryers, in both electric and gas versions, and the agency says these are up to 20 percent more efficient than standard models. They use moisture sensors to stop the dryer when clothes are dry instead of running the entire cycle and lower heat settings that increase dry times but use less power. This can reduce the cost. Any other differences? Manufacturers tend to keep the features the same for the electric and gas versions of the same dryer. Take the Whirlpool model from above: Both have 14 cycles, auto-sensing technology, and four heat levels. The same is true for the much pricier, feature-packed Samsung DVE60M9900V and DVG60M9900V. The electric and gas models have a drying rack on top for small items, steam capability, a vent sensor to detect blockages, five heat settings, and Wi-Fi connectivity. So, which way should you go, gas or electric? “If you have gas or electricity, stay with what you have,” Sheinkopf said. “Looking way ahead, the heat pump drying is the most efficient.” If manufacturers can find a way to speed up heat pump dryers a tad, one day we might all go ventless.","Whether you buy an electric dryer or a gas dryer may depend solely on your setup, unless you want to spend money to get a gas hookup for your home.

Mark Wilson,"I want to tell you about a landmark new device. It features two cameras and a voice- and motion-controlled touch screen. It allows you to teleconference, control your smart home, and even share Instagrams. And its screen is a full 27 inches. It’s the size of an iMac! But it’s not an iMac. It’s a new microwave from GE. Did I mention it also heats your food and features an exhaust hood? [Photos: GE, NOKFreelance/iStock] At this week’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), kitchen appliance manufacturers are in rare form. While the “smart refrigerator” has been around as a concept since 1991 (and a product since 1998 ), this year we’re seeing every single function you’d expect in a modern smartphone or PC–from giant touch screens and AI assistants–stuck inside a box that chills or cooks food. Philips introduced a 24-inch kitchen screen with Google Assistant that specializes in recipes. GE has its iMicrowave (okay, it’s called a Kitchen Hub). Samsung, confusingly, also offers a Family “Hub,” but it’s actually a fridge with Bixby voice-controlled AI and a decent speaker system. Perhaps the biggest smart kitchen armament was announced by LG, which debuted a bunker buster smart fridge that sports a 29-inch screen running webOS with full Amazon Alexa support. AI is often advertised as the defining feature of these gargantuan machines, but they dwarf Google Home or Echo Show as absurdist spectacles. One thousand Google Home Minis must fit inside the footprint of a single LG super-fridge! So, why is the appliance industry’s go-to game plan to throw the kitchen sink... at the kitchen sink? It may have something to do with our current attention economy or the fact that some of the industry’s main players also make smartphones and PCs–or the way our home appliances tend to reflect the concerns of Americans in any given era. My first thought was that LG and Samsung–makers of smartphones, TVs, and tablets–must have something to do with this rise of LCD-infused kitchenware. Surely, these tech powerhouses must be adding touch screens to their appliances as a strategy for besting their U.S. counterparts, Whirlpool and GE. Yet Samsung has been making fridges since 1972. LG has been making kitchen appliances even longer, since the 1950s. It’s just taken the better part of five decades for both Korean companies to usurp Whirlpool and GE as the number one and two brands in total dollar sales in this space, respectively. So we can’t simply attribute all these new products to the fact that “tech” companies are making appliances. [Photos: LG, NOKFreelance/iStock] It’s hard to know how much these bells and whistles have helped either company. It’s possible that this tablet-happy kitchen technology really has helped LG and Samsung get an edge; analysts claim that various design novelties have helped each company differentiate itself from the old guard appliance manufacturers, but brands don’t disclose the success of individual products in their lineups. (Whirlpool points to patent violations and subsidies from the Korean government as both having a factor in its own loss of market share.) It’s hard to believe that the butt of a Silicon Valley joke is really wooing middle America to spend $3,500-plus on a refrigerator just because it’s iPhone-y. [Photos: LG, NOKFreelance/iStock] There are other ways to understand this crop of smartphone-style appliances. The kitchen has a unique place in the American home today. Americans spend more on kitchens than ever before, at a time that we’re actually cooking less than ever before. We demand granite and steel and then order GrubHub anyway. However, the kitchen is not a new obsession for Americans. Just flip through a 1950s Popular Science to see all sorts of crazy concepts for the kitchen of the future. At the time, they were marketed to the busy housewife (though the “housewife” stereotype misses the key fact that women both had more babies and had more jobs in the 1950s than in previous decades). Technology in the kitchen was advertised as a savior for a new generation of mothers who were expected to run a household and work. Companies marketed motorized cabinetry, electronic flour dispensers, car-sized lazy Susans, and a button for every job. The same era brought us all sorts of good ideas still around today: kitchen islands, dishwashing machines, garbage disposals, and even sinks that put both the hot and cold controls on a single handle. These products promised to make Americans’ postwar lives easier, to save them precious minutes while cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and to increase the time they might spend with their families. [Photos: Samsung, NOKFreelance/iStock] Today’s smart appliances do something similar but different: They ask you to spend more time at your fridge or microwave–or on your phone, controlling your fridge or microwave–following the same engagement-equals-success model that our smartphones and apps follow. These appliances are the natural evolution of an engagement-obsessed industry, where constant interaction is the whole point. “We know you’re wasting your day away on screens,” they seem to say, “so waste it away with us, here in your beautiful, way-too-expensive kitchen!” That’s why Samsung offers a video feed to see who is ringing your front door from your refrigerator. And GE has a downward-facing camera in its microwave so you’ll be able to socialize food as it cooks on your stove. Maybe this mind-set is perfect for 2018. If we’re not cooking in that kitchen, we should be doing something in it. Why not Instagram our crushed ice cubes from an appliance that costs as much as a car? It’s a desperate, brute-force approach to design–and it also forgets that one of the fastest-growing sectors of the entire kitchen appliance industry was birthed by an out-of-work dad rather than a multibillion dollar manufacturer. His invention is called the Instant Pot. With a skeleton crew of a company, its creator blindsided every major competitor through a unique value proposition of an automated pressure cooker: not fancy LCD screens or voice recognition systems, but saving a little time in your day, to make your family dinner, and to have time to eat with them, too.","Good news!

Associated Press,"President Donald Trump is signing a measure Tuesday imposing tariffs on imported solar-energy components and large washing machines in a bid to help U.S. manufacturers. The administration says the decision is part of Trump's pledge to put American companies and jobs first. The administration is imposing an immediate tariff of 30 percent on most imported solar modules, with the rate declining before phasing out after four years. For large residential washing machines, tariffs will start at up to 50 percent and phase out after three years. The U.S. solar industry is split over the issue. Two small subsidiaries of foreign companies that made solar cells in the U.S. favor tariffs, but a larger number of companies that install solar-power systems say their costs will rise and jobs will be lost. The Republican's decision followed recommendations for tariffs by the U.S. International Trade Commission. ""The president's action makes clear again that the Trump administration will always defend American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses in this regard,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement announcing the decision. Not everyone agrees the move will work in favor of Americans, including Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse who says his fellow Republicans need to understand that tariffs are a tax on consumers. ""Moms and dads shopping on a budget for a new washing machine will pay for this -- not big companies,"" Sasse said in a statement. China accused Trump of jeopardizing the multilateral trading system by taking action on complaints under U.S. law instead of through the World Trade Organization. ""The U.S. side once again abused its trade remedy measures,"" said a Commerce Ministry statement. ""China expresses its strong dissatisfaction with this."" Mexico said Trump's decision not to exclude it from the measures was ""regrettable."" ""Mexico will use all available legal resources in response to the U.S. decision to apply protections on Mexican washing machines and solar panels,"" its Economy Department said in a statement. The U.S. solar industry was split over the trade barriers. The tariffs were sought last year by Suniva Inc., which filed for bankruptcy protection in April, and the U.S. subsidiary of Germany's SolarWorld. They said that a nearly 500 percent increase in imported solar panels over five years led to a ruinous price collapse. Nearly 30 U.S. solar-manufacturing facilities had closed in the past five years, they said, as China plotted to flood the global market with cheap products to weaken U.S. manufacturing. Suniva spokesman Mark Paustenbach called tariffs ""a step forward for this high-tech solar-manufacturing industry we pioneered right here in America."" However, solar installers and manufacturers of other equipment used to run solar-power systems opposed tariffs, which they said will raise their prices and hurt demand for the renewable energy. The Solar Energy Industries Association, which represents installation companies, said billions of dollars of solar investment will be delayed or canceled, leading to the loss of 23,000 jobs this year. Mark Bortman, founder of Exact Solar in Philadelphia, said the prospect of tariffs, since the trade commission recommended them in October, had already caused him to delay hiring and expansion plans. ""Solar is really just starting to take off because it is truly a win-win-win situation"" for consumers, workers and the environment, he said. ""Tariffs would really be shooting ourselves in the foot."" The case for tariffs on washing machines was pushed by Benton Harbor, Michigan-based Whirlpool Corp. The company's chairman, Jeff Fettig, said tariffs on imported machines would create new manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee. ""This is a victory for American workers and consumers alike,"" Fettig said. ""By enforcing our existing trade laws, President Trump has ensured American workers will compete on a level playing field with their foreign counterparts."" Suniva, SolarWorld and Whirlpool were helped by a 1974 trade law that lets companies seek trade protection if they can show damage from a rise in imports. Up to certain levels, imports of solar cells will be exempt from the tariff, while the first 1.2 million imported large washing machines will get a lower tariff, peaking at 20 percent. Congress has no authority to change or veto Trump's decision. Countries affected by the decision can appeal to the World Trade Organization. --The Associated Press",The decision is part of President Trump's 'America first' policy.,2018-01-23T17:38:55Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Why the U.S. Solar Industry Is Divided About Trump's 30 Percent Tariff on Solar Panels,https://www.inc.com/associated-press/donald-trump-administration-30-percent-tariff-solar-panel-import-washing-machines.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_114338035_20001333200092800_341874.jpg,,Inc.com,whirlpool,1

newsfeedback@fool.com (Rich Smith),"Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope... Buy Whirlpool Corporation ( NYSE:WHR ) stock! President Trump's import tariffs on washing machines will crush its competitors! No, sell Whirlpool shares! Trump's tariffs on steel will crush Whirlpool's profits. Appropriately for a company with such a name, Whirlpool sits at the confluence of two apparently diametrically opposed tariff policies from the Trump administration. One is designed to raise the cost of buying foreign-made washing machines, which would give Whirlpool room to raise its own prices on these major home appliances without seeming much more expensive than the competition. The other tariff, however, would raise the cost of steel Whirlpool imports to build its washers with, increasing the company's input costs and hurting Whirlpool's profits, despite its higher selling prices. How should investors weigh the potential of these two sets of tariffs to affect Whirlpool's business, and what will it mean for Whirlpool stock? Investment banker Credit Suisse just came up with one answer: Whirlpool stock will outperform the market over the next year. Here's what you need to know. Whirlpool stock sits at the center of conflicting Trump tariffs strategies. Image source: Getty Images. Tariff No. 1: Washing machines In January, the Trump Administration slapped 20% initial tariffs on washing machines imported from abroad, including on washers from Samsung and LG, both highly rated by Consumer Reports and strong competitors to Whirlpool. Tariffs are expected to later rise as high as 50%. Goldman Sachs has predicted the average cost of a washing machine in the U.S. will spike by 8% to 20% this year. These tariffs are already making themselves felt in the form of price hikes across a range of home appliances, which have risen 5% on average in the U.S., as Credit Suisse explains in its upgrade today, covered on StreetInsider.com (requires subscription). Washers and dryers, says the analyst, are enjoying the greatest increases in price -- which is exactly what you'd expect to happen in the wake of the Trump tariffs. Tariff No. 2: Steel and aluminum Also contributing to price hikes in the home appliances industry, however, are the Trump administration's imposition of new tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) imports. It wasn't clear at first whether these tariffs were actually going to go into effect, or whether they'd be as wide-ranging as initially promised. Last week, however, the Trump Administration confirmed it will be going ahead with imposing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and Europe. Already, says Credit Suisse, steel prices have risen 30% so far this year in response to the steel tariffs threat. Even if there had been no tariff on washer imports, therefore, it's likely that companies such as Whirlpool would have had to raise prices on their products to recover the additional cost of manufacturing washers and other appliances -- directly tied to this set of tariffs. How the tariffs interact Having had several months now to examine the effect of the threat of these tariffs coming into effect, Credit Suisse now says its seeing...little net effect at all. To the contrary, says Credit Suisse, channel checks are showing industry ""sell-through"" of appliances continuing to grow at 2% to 4%, such that if prices are rising, it's not seeming to curb consumer demand. What's more, as the analyst explains in its write-up today, rising prices on appliances ""should help offset higher input costs for Whirlpool."" The analyst sees this trend continuing to support ""improved profitability in North America over the next several quarters"" for Whirlpool. And in response to this belief, Credit Suisse is upgrading Whirlpool shares to outperform and assigning the stock a $195 price target that implies nearly 35% upside from today's prices. Is that likely? Valuing Whirlpool Valued at $10.6 billion in market capitalization today, Whirlpool stock currently sells for nearly 32 times trailing earnings and 45 times free cash flow -- which sounds like a lot. Analysts who follow the stock, however, see Whirlpool greatly increasing its profits this year, now that last year's depressed earnings due to tax reform are past. How much more? The consensus of analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence is that Whirlpool will earn more than $13 per share this year (nearly triple last year's $4.70 in GAAP profits). Free cash flow is expected to more than triple to $1 billion, then keep on growing pretty steadily thereafter. Assuming Whirlpool earns as much as it's expected to this year, and also grows at the average 10% rate that analysts expect it to grow over the next five years, that may be fast enough growth to justify the stock's price. Based on current-year expected earnings, and valuing the stock on market cap alone, Whirlpool costs 11.3 times this year's profits. On the other hand, though, Whirlpool stock also carries a heaping helping of debt -- $4 billion net of cash on hand. Factored into the valuation, this debt raises the company's debt-adjusted market capitalization (its enterprise value) to $14.6 billion, and puts its debt-adjusted P/E at 15.6. Is 10% growth good enough to justify that valuation? Even factoring a 3% dividend yield into the picture, I kind of suspect it's not. More importantly, though, Credit Suisse is basing its upgrade today not just on a belief that Whirlpool stock is worth what it costs now, but that it will be worth 35% a year from now. I think that's a very difficult case to make, especially with the uncertainties of Trump tariff policies (and his likeliness to stick to them) thrown into the picture. I wouldn't be buying Whirlpool stock today. It might be fairly priced, but it's certainly not as cheap as Credit Suisse says.",Whirlpool sits at the center of Trump tariffs on steel and appliances.,2018-06-04T16:05:24Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fool.com'}",Whirlpool Corporation Stock Upgraded: What You Need to Know,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/06/04/whirlpool-corporation-stock-upgraded-what-you-need.aspx,https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F484422%2Fwashing-machine-wringer.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize,,Fool.com,whirlpool,1
Bruce Brown,"GE Appliances’s latest French door refrigerator is all about interior space, stressing high capacity in the value-priced appliance. According to GE, the GE ENERGY STAR 25.6-cubic foot French door frig, which has an expected $2,400 retail price, has one cubic foot greater capacity than comparable refrigerators priced from $951 to $2,500 from other leading brands including Samsung, LG, and Whirlpool. Need room for an extra 50 soda cans or a cubic-foot container with 64 sliced-up oranges for team practice? According to GE, those are just two examples of what the extra cubic foot can hold in the new fridge. The three-door appliance has open shelves so you can easily slide in an extra large pizza box or party tray. Adjustable shelves let you make room for a fat watermelon, and door bins can be configured to fit tall containers. There are two humidity-controlled cabinet drawers for meat and produce and a full-width deli drawer. The 8.1-cubic foot bottom drawer freezer has two storage baskets. Interior lights for both refrigerator and freezer sections use white LED bulbs. “If you want more flexibility in your refrigerator, we have the answer,” said Lee Lagomarcino, GE Appliances marketing director for refrigeration products. “More room can mean less food waste because you can actually see what’s inside your fridge before it spoils, or maybe you’ve wanted to stock up when items go on sale and now you can. At some point we’ve all wished for more room and this unit was designed to solve that problem.” GE doesn’t restrict your preference for color or water and ice dispensing. You can choose from nine options with the new GE French door model based on exterior finish and water and ice dispenser location: Fridges with external dispensers in black stainless, black slate, stainless steel, or slate Fridges with internal dispensers in stainless steel, slate, black, or white Fridges without dispensers in stainless steel Water filtration for models with dispensers filter contaminants and trace chemicals from water and ice.

newsfeedback@fool.com (Demitrios Kalogeropoulos),"What happened
Shares of appliance specialist Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) outpaced the market by a wide margin last month, gaining 24% compared to a 8% spike in the S&amp;P 500, according to data provided by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.
The rally only removed a portion of shareholders' recent losses, and the stock is still down over 20% in the past 52 weeks, verses a 2% drop in the wider market.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
The stock benefited from improving investor expectations around the prospects of a global recession last month. These fears helped drive Whirlpool shares lower in December, so the company was in an ideal position to post market-beating gains if the worries subsided, as they did last month.
Executives added to the optimism by revealing plenty of good news in their fourth-quarter report. That announcement showed flat global sales but rising profitability as the company passed along price increases. That allowed Whirlpool to generate healthy growth in earnings and cash flow despite what management called the ""macroeconomic volatility"" that hurt demand and boosted costs in many of its markets.
Now what
CEO Marc Bitzer and his team issued a conservative outlook for 2019 that leaves the door open for a second straight year of modestly declining sales. Uncertainty on world trade and economic growth might keep the overall industry roughly flat, they said. But Whirlpool's cost cuts, and its ability to pass along price increases, should help keep profitability marching higher so that it can deliver bigger profits despite those sluggish selling conditions.",Investors cheered news that the appliance giant was able to pass along higher costs to customers last quarter.,2019-02-04T18:26:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fool.com'}",Why Whirlpool Stock Gained 24% in January,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/04/why-whirlpool-stock-gained-24-in-january.aspx,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/509769/woman-using-washer.jpg,,Fool.com,whirlpool,1
Stephanie Valera,"Locals were mystified after strange “whirlpool holes” in the sky appeared over UAE and Oman this weekend.
Images and videos posted to Twitter and Facebook show a large circular patch in the sky, appearing as if somebody “punched a hole” in the atmosphere.

 (@ibrahimaljarwan) March 17, 2019
Meteorologist Ebrahim Al Jarwan, who posted video of the strange sight, said that the “rare and beautiful” phenomenon was referred to as a “fallstreak hole” or “hole punch cloud.”
A fallstreak hole is a large circular or elliptical gap that can appear in cirrocumulus or altocumulus clouds, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).
Fallstreak holes usually form in mid- to high-level clouds, which are often composed of tiny water droplets that are much colder than freezing, but have yet to freeze. These “supercooled” water droplets need a “reason” to freeze, which usually comes in the form of ice crystals. Airplanes passing through the cloud layer can bring these ice crystals.
Once the ice crystals are introduced, the water droplet quickly freeze, grow and start to fall. A hole is then left behind, which will start to expand outward as neighboring droplets start to freeze, NWS said.
Because of their strange appearance and rarity   are often attributed to UFOs because they form as large circular gaps in cirrocumulus or altocumulus clouds. But rest easy, they are just super-cool cloud formations.

Shifrah Combiths,"Leaving wet clothes in the washer is one of those things people have strong opinions about — and if you do it regularly, you might not broadcast it in fear of being thought of as a lazy, rule-breaking launderer. So, whether it's purposeful or accidental, what's the real truth about this practice? Some people would never dream of leaving wet clothes in the washer, and will time their laundry around making sure they're available to toss their loads into the dryer as soon as the washer beeps. I, however, won't go to sleep or out of the house with the dryer on, just because of the fire risk dryers can pose. So I frequently leave wet clothes sitting in the washer. And, yes, often overnight. Turns out that the home-keeping guru herself, Martha Stewart, says this is perfectly fine. When asked on the TODAY show for her opinion on the matter, she responded with: ""I would say that was perfectly alright. I mean don't leave it for a long time... don't leave it for a week. If you get up in the morning and throw it in the dryer, it should probably be OK."" Real Simple corroborates. In ""What's the Worst that Could Happen?"" the most likely consequence of leaving wet clothes in the washer is ""nothing will happen."" When asked how to tell if your laundry is alright, Martha has this to offer: ""One way you can kind of tell is if it smells alright. That mold and that bacteria that starts to grow on damp clothes and environments, that's very pungent."" Yes! The good old smell test. Real Simple, citing Whirlpool Institute of Fabric Science's lead home economist, Lucinda Ottusch, gives the more concrete guideline of 8-12 hours before odor, a sign of mildew, begins to occur. What to do if your clothes do smell off? Simply run the wash cycle again. Definitely don't dry the clothes if there's any hint of them being not fresh; the smell will not go away and you'll have to do the whole load again anyway. And try not to make a habit of leaving wet clothes in the washer. Long term or repeatedly, it's not good for your washer or your clothes.

I've never been anywhere that felt more futuristic -- the new architecture is Jetsonian. But many neighborhoods look like they haven't changed much since the late 1800s (they are still sparkling clean). It seemed like there were a half dozen restaurants on every block - Chinese, Malaysian, Indonesian, Indian, Middle Eastern. The blend of old and new, and the blend of many different ethnic groups was very appealing. I was aware that Singapore is a strict country - they execute drug smugglers, and chewing gum is forbidden. But after watching this video, I also learned that selling gum in Singapore can land you in prison for two years. Singing in public (without a license) is punishable by two months in prison. Connecting to someone else's Wifi could cost you three years in the slammer. Neglecting to flush a public toilet could result in a $150 fine -- and cops can tell because some toilets have urine detectors installed in them that cause the door to be locked so the offender can be nabbed. Being naked in your own house carries a $1000 penalty. CCTV's monitor people in public and will get sent tickets for jaywalking.

ABC News,"Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. President Donald Trump is signing a measure Tuesday imposing tariffs on imported solar-energy components and large washing machines in a bid to help U.S. manufacturers. The administration says the decision is part of Trump's pledge to put American companies and jobs first. The administration is imposing an immediate tariff of 30 percent on most imported solar modules, with the rate declining before phasing out after four years. For large residential washing machines, tariffs will start at up to 50 percent and phase out after three years. The U.S. solar industry is split over the issue. Two small subsidiaries of foreign companies that made solar cells in the U.S. favor tariffs, but a larger number of companies that install solar-power systems say their costs will rise and jobs will be lost. The Republican's decision followed recommendations for tariffs by the U.S. International Trade Commission. ""The president's action makes clear again that the Trump administration will always defend American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses in this regard,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement announcing the decision. Not everyone agrees the move will work in favor of Americans, including Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse who says his fellow Republicans need to understand that tariffs are a tax on consumers. ""Moms and dads shopping on a budget for a new washing machine will pay for this — not big companies,"" Sasse said in a statement. China accused Trump of jeopardizing the multilateral trading system by taking action on complaints under U.S. law instead of through the World Trade Organization. ""The U.S. side once again abused its trade remedy measures,"" said a Commerce Ministry statement. ""China expresses its strong dissatisfaction with this."" Mexico said Trump's decision not to exclude it from the measures was ""regrettable."" ""Mexico will use all available legal resources in response to the U.S. decision to apply protections on Mexican washing machines and solar panels,"" its Economy Department said in a statement. The U.S. solar industry was split over the trade barriers. The tariffs were sought last year by Suniva Inc., which filed for bankruptcy protection in April, and the U.S. subsidiary of Germany's SolarWorld. They said that a nearly 500 percent increase in imported solar panels over five years led to a ruinous price collapse. Nearly 30 U.S. solar-manufacturing facilities had closed in the past five years, they said, as China plotted to flood the global market with cheap products to weaken U.S. manufacturing. Suniva spokesman Mark Paustenbach called tariffs ""a step forward for this high-tech solar-manufacturing industry we pioneered right here in America."" However, solar installers and manufacturers of other equipment used to run solar-power systems opposed tariffs, which they said will raise their prices and hurt demand for the renewable energy. The Solar Energy Industries Association, which represents installation companies, said billions of dollars of solar investment will be delayed or canceled, leading to the loss of 23,000 jobs this year. Mark Bortman, founder of Exact Solar in Philadelphia, said the prospect of tariffs, since the trade commission recommended them in October, had already caused him to delay hiring and expansion plans. ""Solar is really just starting to take off because it is truly a win-win-win situation"" for consumers, workers and the environment, he said. ""Tariffs would really be shooting ourselves in the foot."" The case for tariffs on washing machines was pushed by Benton Harbor, Michigan-based Whirlpool Corp. The company's chairman, Jeff Fettig, said tariffs on imported machines would create new manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee. ""This is a victory for American workers and consumers alike,"" Fettig said. ""By enforcing our existing trade laws, President Trump has ensured American workers will compete on a level playing field with their foreign counterparts."" Suniva, SolarWorld and Whirlpool were helped by a 1974 trade law that lets companies seek trade protection if they can show damage from a rise in imports. Up to certain levels, imports of solar cells will be exempt from the tariff, while the first 1.2 million imported large washing machines will get a lower tariff, peaking at 20 percent. Congress has no authority to change or veto Trump's decision. Countries affected by the decision can appeal to the World Trade Organization.",President Donald Trump is signing a measure Tuesday imposing tariffs on imported solar-energy components and large washing machines in a bid to help U.S. manufacturers.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","The Whirlpool Galaxy and companion galaxy as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope. This represents a merger between two galaxies similar in mass to the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Talk about your fender bender.
Although it's not something we have to worry about any time soon, our Milky Way galaxy could collide with a nearby galaxy (the Large Magellenic Cloud) in a ""spectacular"" cosmic collision in about 2 billion years, a new study suggests.
Future earthlings may find this of interest, since the collision might knock our solar system ""out of the Milky Way and into interstellar space,"" said study lead author Marius Cautun of Durham University in the U.K. 
Fortunately for our descendants or whatever species still lives here at that time researchers say its very unlikely that this event will put life on Earth at risk, according to Quartz. 
Study co-author Carlos Frenk, also of Durham, said that ""barring any disasters, like a major disturbance to the Solar System, our descendants, if any, are in for a treat: a spectacular display of cosmic fireworks as the newly awakened supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy reacts by emitting jets of extremely bright energetic radiation.""
Rooftop bars might be packed that night. 
In any event, ""the destruction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, as it is devoured by the Milky Way, will wreak havoc with our galaxy,"" according to Cautun.  It will turn the Milky Way into ""an active galactic nucleus or quasar,"" he said.
The event may seem far away for most people, but not for astronomers: ""While two billion years is an extremely long time compared to a human lifetime, it is a very short time on cosmic timescales,"" Cautun said in a statement.
The Large Magellanic Cloud is the brightest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way and only entered our ""neighborhood"" about 1.5 billion years ago, according to the study. It's about 163,000 light years from the Milky Way.

The collision could occur much earlier than the predicted impact between the Milky Way and another neighboring galaxy, Andromeda, which scientists say will hit our galaxy in about 8 billion years.
The study was published Jan. 4 in the peer-reviewed journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Austen Hufford,"Whirlpool Corp. Chief Executive Marc Bitzer will become chairman of the appliance makers board at the end of the year, taking over completely from his longtime predecessor, Jeff Fettig. Mr. Bitzer was promoted from president and chief operating officer to CEO of Benton Harbor, Mich.,-based Whirlpool in Oct. 2017. Mr. Fettig was chairman and CEO from 2004 until he stepped down from the chief executive role last year. Whirlpools shares, down 34% this year, were flat in after-hours trading. Caterpillar Inc., another major manufacturer, last week said its CEO Jim Umpleby, was also assuming the chairman role that the company had kept separate from its top executive post for some time. Some corporate-governance experts say separate executive and board leadership can improve oversight. About 40% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 keep their CEO and chairman positions separate, according to corporate data provider MyLogIQ. Whirlpool said in a March filing that having a separate chairman and CEO was appropriate during the transition from Mr. Fettigs leadership to Mr. Bitzers. Whirlpool also said that it has a presiding director, Samuel Allen, on its board assigned to help evaluate the performance of the CEO. Whirlpool has been raising prices to stay ahead of rising material costs. The Trump administration earlier this year imposed tariffs on imported washing machines after the company lobbied for protection from what it called unfair foreign competition. But the company has also seen higher production costs due to separate tariffs placed on imported steel and aluminum. The company has also been hurt by the bankruptcy of major appliance retailer Sears Holdings Corp. as well as declining sales and deepening losses in its business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

C. Scott Brown,"The smart display market started ramping up with the launch of the Lenovo Smart Display and continued to build steam with the launch of the Google Home Hub. Now, a new company is entering the market: KitchenAid, with its new KitchenAid Smart Display, set to debut at CES 2019.
Although the 10-inch smart display looks a lot like the ones from Lenovo and Google, there is one major difference: splash resistance. The KitchenAid Smart Display is IPX5-certified, which means it can handle getting sprayed with water from a common household faucet.
Google Home Hub: Google’s in-house smart display announced
Since one of the most popular places for smart displays (and smart speakers) is the kitchen, KitchenAid which is owned by Whirlpool  might just be onto something with making a splash-resistant smart display. Even if you’re not worried about accidentally splashing your smart display, the IPX5 rating enables you to easily clean your display if you get some cookie dough or other food substances on it.
Whirlpool also owns a recipe app called Yummly, which the KitchenAid Smart Display will have integrated into it. This will be a welcome feature and will work in addition to the usual Google Assistant features one expects with a smart display such as smart home control, Google searches, music and media playback, etc.
NEXT: Google Home Hub vs Lenovo Smart Display
According to CNET, the KitchenAid Smart Display will cost between $200 and $300. The 10-inch Lenovo Smart Display retails for $250, so that seems to be the magic price point for a 10-inch model. However, the Google Home Hub starts at $150, so it might be a tough choice if a 10-inch screen and an IPX5 rating aren’t that important to you.
Either way, the device won’t hit the market until the second half of 2019, so you’ve got a little bit of a wait.",The KitchenAid Smart Display will be perfect for the kitchen since it will be splash-resistant.,2019-01-06T19:59:26Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Androidauthority.com'}",This KitchenAid Smart Display has an IPX5 water resistance rating,https://www.androidauthority.com/kitchenaid-smart-display-940147/,https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KitchenAid-Smart-Display-851x470.jpg,,Androidauthority.com,whirlpool,1
newsfeedback@fool.com (Asit Sharma),"What happened Shares of appliance manufacturer Whirlpool Corporation ( NYSE:WHR ) dipped 10.5% last month, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Due to one external boon, February could have been a positive month for Whirlpool stock. On Jan. 22, the Trump administration announced trade tariffs which included a 20% tariff on the first 1.2 million washing machines imported into the U.S., and a 50% tariff on all subsequent imported washers. This action will positively benefit Whirlpool's U.S. sales, although it's too early to quantify the financial impact. Shares subsequently rose 11% over the next few trading sessions, a week in which Whirlpool also issued fourth-quarter 2017 earnings. Though it took a few days after Whirlpool's Jan. 24 earnings release to dampen tariff-influenced buying enthusiasm, investors eventually cooled on the results. Fourth-quarter net sales of $5.7 billion topped the prior-year quarter by only one percent, and after adjusting for foreign currency effects, the top line actually decreased by 1.6%. Management's forecast for 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share, of $14.50 to $15.50, also failed to impress. Whirlpool posted adjusted diluted EPS of $13.74 in 2017, and aside from representing a rather modest increase, the 2018 expectation hardly improves on the $14.06 in adjusted EPS booked back in 2016. Image source: Getty Images. So what Caution around gross margin may inform the current conservative earnings forecast. While management stated a goal of increasing EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin in 2018, pressures on cost of goods sold may complicate the push. During the fourth quarter, rising commodity costs cut into gross margin in each of the company's geographical segments. The bite was most pronounced within the non-North American divisions: Asia, Latin America, and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa). For example, raw-materials inflation more than offset productivity improvements in the EMEA business, causing segment operating profit to drop from $45 million in Q4 2016 to just $4 million in the recently concluded quarter. Now what Investors may remain wary of Whirlpool until benefits from import tariffs materialize later this year. For now, a tepid top line and the prospect of climbing commodity inputs are creating pessimism over the company's earnings momentum in 2018.",A tangible piece of good news was undercut by worries over current-year prospects.,2018-03-14T20:07:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fool.com'}",Why Whirlpool Corp.

Sharon Franke,"In the grand scheme of kitchen tools, your blender doesn't need a whole lot of TLC. I'd say it falls somewhere between a cast iron skillet and an ice cube tray on the scale of neediness. That's not to say it doesn't need any special attention, because it does. In fact, there are two mistakes you might be making that will keep it from working smoothly (excuse the pun). Here are the two worst things you can do to your blender. 1. Layering your ingredients incorrectly. Yes, the stuff is all going to get mixed up, but it really does matter what order you add your ingredients. Put your liquids in first and, when you start the blender, it will create a whirlpool effect that sucks the other ingredients in and gets them whirring. Read more : A Layering Guide to a Better Smoothie Throw things in all willy-nilly and your blender could struggle to get pieces of mango and peaches moving. And that puts stress on the motor. As a result, your blender can stall or, even worse, punk out on you. By placing things in the correct order, you're reducing the chance you'll wind up with a broken blender. 2. Not cleaning it well enough. It's okay to simply rinse the blender jar before running out the door (and no judgement if you don't even do that) but be sure to take it apart and wash everything when you get home at night. According to NSF International, the public health and safety organization, the gunkiest thing in your kitchen is your blender gasket. Ecks!

These trucks will ensure retailers are well-stocked in time for Maytag Month, which is the brand’s annual promotional event that officially begins on May 3. Guess where the trucks are at a given timr, and you could win yourself a whole bunch of appliances. In anticipation of Maytag Month, four trucks will make “unexpected” stops throughout April. Consumers will be asked to pinpoint where they think the trucks are located based on a photograph. Location clues can be found at Maytag.com/PowerDelivered. On the website, players can browse the location online, dragging the mouse around to get a 360-degree view of the surroundings. Here’s an example of a clue for truck 1: “About 1,860 miles from Maytag HQ in Michigan.” Players can then drop a pin on the spot where they believe the truck is parked, and click “Submit Location.” The website will then prompt the user to enter an email address, which will be used to notify the lucky winners.

Stephen L. Macknik,"A walkthrough of the new exhibit—Our Senses—at The American Museum of Natural History may not be as easy as it sounds. The 11-room whirlpool of perceptual delights is a completely novel experience in sensory perception. In it you will experience the five senses not only as a human, but also as animals with different sensory domains. You will see in infra-red like a snake and in ultra-violet like a butterfly. The exhibit goes beyond basic sensation and perception to explore the integration of your perceptual systems. In the Balance room, your visual and vestibular systems—one sees light and one detects the direction of gravity as downwards—compete for dominance. The walls of the room are painted in wavy curves, but the Earth’s gravity remains exactly the way it should: your brain has a hard time reconciling the two inputs because your visual system is used to walls being straight up-and-down affairs. It’s a positively barfalicious and thrilling epiphany to realize that your vision--even illusory vision--contributes so strongly to your balance in the gravity well of our planet. Further still, the exhibit explores and explains other aspects of perception that are traditionally not discussed as sensory percepts; though they should be. For example, your eye movements and attention are revealed as critical to your experience of basic visibility, and unified chocolatey odors are revealed as being made up of a miasma of distinct components typically available only to perfumers and wine connoisseurs. And then there are the illusions themselves. The Senses exhibit provides both novel illusory adventures as well as some of the finest demonstrations to date of classical illusions. A main highlight of the exhibit is the immersive contrast perception in the “Color” room. The room’s walls display a myriad of superimposed images when the lighting is white (leftmost multicolored image below).. But as the lights cycle in wavelength to blue, green, and red, the images separate from each other and become distinct and non-superimposed animal shapes—revealing how vision relies on differences in reflectance between the surface on an object versus the background, as a function of the contrast created by the color of the light source. A remarkably powerful demonstration of a complex visual process!","The exhibit at the AMNH is a new and totally fresh look at our sensory systems, with demonstrations that you won’t see elsewhere -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com",2017-12-29T20:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",The Senses at the American Museum of Natural History,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/the-senses-at-the-american-museum-of-natural-history/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/871E629F-8250-4C08-A3346A801136DAEC_agenda.jpg?w=600&h=335,,Scientificamerican.com,whirlpool,1

(Photo: Oyster.com) Along with frolicking on a beach, splashing around in a water park tops any list of classic summer activities. These aquatic playgrounds — complete with winding waterslides, relaxing lazy rivers, suspended buckets of water and interactive playscapes — offer a fun way to beat the heat. Fortunately, there are a number of resorts that house water parks of their own, relieving families of the stress of loading the kids up in the car, finding parking, and paying for admission. Memories Splash Punta Cana, Dominican Republic Memories Splash Punta Cana doesn’t just have a water park on its premises — it has the biggest water park in the Caribbean. Kids of all ages (and their parents, of course) can zoom down water tubes, get soaked by suspended buckets of water and brave the refreshing wave pool. For more adrenaline-pumping adventures, head to the 370-foot Black Hole waterslide that seems to defy the laws of physics. The Kamikaze waterslide also thrills with a 50-foot vertical drop and stellar views of the resort. Beaches Turks &amp; Caicos Resort Villages and Spa, Turks and Caicos This family-friendly resort in Providenciales might entertain its guests with multiple pools (several of which have swim-up bars), a shopping center, large spa complex, and numerous restaurants and bars, but that’s arguably not even its biggest draw. Visitors looking for a mega-fun time might think the property’s crown jewel is its 45,000-square-foot water park instead. Whether your idea of fun is floating down a 650-foot lazy river, hanging 10 with a surf simulator, getting blasted with water cannons, wading in a whirlpool or throwing your hands up while plummeting down fast-flying waterslides, this sprawling space brings fun for all ages. Hilton Rose Hall Resort &amp; Spa, Jamaica Situated on Jamaica’s resort-heavy north shore, Montego Bay's Hilton Rose Hall Resort &amp; Spa has all the typical trimmings of an excellent all-inclusive resort (a pretty beach, a relaxing spa, several restaurants and a couple of pools). However, it manages to stand out among the rest of the pack, thanks to the onsite water park — the largest in Jamaica. Connected to the expansive lagoon-style pool complex, this oasis appeals to both kids and adults with a 280-foot slide, a lazy river, several terraced pools, and a jungle garden with a rope-and-wood suspension bridge. Throw in poolside drink service, plus a swim-up bar, and you can count on a lively and loud atmosphere.

Also there to occupy little ones is the water park, which features 17 waterslides and a variety of shallow water play areas. For older kids, there’s a kids’ club with a movie screening room, video games and a small rock climbing wall. Nightly shows, guided walks, dance classes and beach activities round out the offerings nicely. Beaches Negril Resort &amp; Spa, Jamaica Families traveling with kids in tow need not worry about their little ones staying busy at this all-inclusive resort. With a kids’ camp, several pools, activities including breakfast with Sesame Street characters and an expansive water park, children will be entertained through and through. Speaking of the latter, the 18,000-square-foot water park is perfect for kids of all ages, with everything from 200-foot-long waterslides to a lazy river to a plunge pool. That’s not to say there’s nothing to entertain mom and dad.

The Sunrise kids’ club, with a mini racetrack, art room and arcade, keeps little ones happy indoors. Outside, there’s a water park with slides, a swim-up bar and a Flowrider machine. Just don’t expect pristine white sand and turquoise waters at the property — unlike the Hotel Zone, the beaches in this area of town often have an unpleasant odor and are strewn with seaweed. Coconut Bay Beach Resort &amp; Spa, St. Lucia The 250-room Coconut Bay Beach Resort &amp; Spa offers the best of both worlds: a section for adults (Harmony) and one for families (Splash). In the Splash section, you’ll find the kid-friendly pool with a separate swim-up bar for adults and children, as well as the water park, which features waterslides, a lazy river and a small plunge pool. Meanwhile, grown-ups can take advantage of the 11,000-square-foot spa, fitness center, tennis courts, and an adults-only pool with heated whirlpool and waiter service. Of course, the mile-long beach, with sun loungers and umbrellas, is also a great spot to get your vacation on.

B.R. Srihari,"It has been ten years since the investment banking firm Lehman Brothers collapsed in mid-September 2008. Shortly after, there was a meltdown in global financial markets, including India. What triggered the crisis? From 2005 to 2007, at the height of the real estate bubble, mortgages were given to many homebuyers who could not afford them, and then packaged into securities and sold off. Lehman Brothers bought several mortgage brokerages and posted record profits. But in mid-2007, defaults on sub-prime mortgages rose exponentially. A credit crisis erupted in August 2007 with the failure of two Bear Stearns hedge funds while payment defaults triggered massive declines in banks and real estate incomes. In 2008, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. Was there any ‘rescue act’ by banks? In 2008, when America’s two biggest banks Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers reported high losses due to huge exposure to risk assets, all triggered by sub-prime lending by banking institutions, Bank of America came to the rescue of Merrill Lynch while Lehman Brothers had to file for bankruptcy. What is a sub-prime loan? Sub-prime refers to a loan given to a borrower who does not qualify for a regular home loan because of a poor credit record, low income and lack of job security. If the customer has a poor credit record, why did banks offer a loan? The main reason was banks expected the value of the underlying security or the property to go up. So, they increased the mortgage interest rate (higher than the conventional loan) and called it a sub-prime mortgage. They could earn more with the higher mortgage interest rate and if the borrowers discontinued repayment, they could sell the property for a higher consideration due to appreciation in property prices. Was India insulated? The impact on the Indian economy was less severe due to lower dependence on exports and the fact that a sizeable contribution to the GDP came from domestic sources. Indian banks had limited exposure to the U.S. mortgage market, directly or through derivatives, and also to the failed and financially-stressed global financial institutions.",Sub-prime mortgages drew institutions into a whirlpool,2018-09-16T16:30:32Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Everything you need to know: When the world collapsed around Lehman Brothers,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/everything-you-need-to-know-when-the-world-collapsed-around-lehman-brothers/article24962130.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,the-hindu,The Hindu,whirlpool,1

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has rattled the world trade order by imposing unilateral tariffs to combat what he calls unfair trade practices by China, the European Union and other major trading partners of the United States. The actions led to tit-for-tat retaliation, including a growing tariff war with China that threatens to engulf all trade between the world’s two largest economies. The following is a rundown of major U.S. tariff actions and retaliatory measures in 2018: U.S. GLOBAL TARIFFS - 25 percent tariffs on imported steel and 10 percent tariffs on imported aluminum, imposed on March 23 on national security grounds. Exemptions have been granted to Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Korea in exchange for quotas, and negotiations over quotas continue with Canada, Mexico and the European Union. - 20 percent to 50 percent tariffs on imported washing machines, imposed Jan. 22 as a “global safeguard” action to protect U.S. producers Whirlpool and GE Appliances, a unit of China’s Haier Group - 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels, imposed Jan. 22 as a “global safeguard” action to protect U.S. producers Solar World, based in Germany, and Suniva, owned by China’s Shunfeng International Clean Energy Ltd - Trump is considering tariffs of around 25 percent on imported cars and auto parts, based on a U.S. Commerce Department study of whether such imports threaten U.S. national security. The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement trade deal protects Canadian and Mexican production in the event of such tariffs through a quota system. Trump has pledged not to impose auto tariffs on Japan and the European Union while trade negotiations with those partners are underway. U.S. TARIFFS ON CHINA - 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese technology goods including machinery, semiconductors, autos, aircraft parts and intermediate electronics components imposed July 6 and Aug. 23 as part of “Section 301” probe into China’s intellectual property practices. - 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods including chemicals, building materials, furniture and some consumer electronics, imposed Sept. 24 as a response to Chinese retaliation. The levy on these imports is scheduled to increase to 25 percent on Jan. 1, 2019. - If an agreement with China cannot be reached, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese goods, representing all remaining imports from China, including cell phones, computers, clothing, footwear and other consumer products. - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday that Trump has directed him to pursue all tools to raise the U.S. tariff rate on Chinese autos to the 40 percent that China is now charging on cars and trucks built in the United States. The United States charges 27.5 percent tariffs on Chinese vehicles. CHINESE TARIFFS ON UNITED STATES - 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods including soybeans, beef, pork, seafood, vegetables, whiskey, ethanol and motor vehicles, imposed July 6 and Aug. 23 in retaliation for initial rounds of U.S. tariffs. - Tariffs of 5 percent to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, including liquefied natural gas, chemicals, frozen vegetables and food ingredients, imposed Sept. 24. - Based on 2017 U.S. Census Bureau trade data, China only would have about $20 billion in U.S. imports left to levy in retaliation for any future U.S. tariffs, of which $16 billion were commercial aircraft, largely built by Boeing Co. Retaliation could come in other forms, such as increased regulatory hurdles for U.S. companies doing business in China. CANADIAN TARIFFS ON UNITED STATES - Canada on July 1 imposed tariffs on $12.6 billion worth of U.S. goods, including steel, aluminum, coffee, ketchup and bourbon whiskey in retaliation for U.S tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. ( tinyurl.com/y8w5g895 ) MEXICAN TARIFFS ON UNITED STATES - Mexico on June 5 imposed tariffs of up to 25 percent on American steel, pork, cheese, apples, potatoes and bourbon, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Mexican metals. EUROPEAN UNION TARIFFS ON UNITED STATES - The European Union on June 22 imposed import duties of 25 percent on a $2.8 billion range of imports from the United States in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum. Targeted U.S. products include Harley-Davidson motorcycles, bourbon, peanuts, blue jeans, steel and aluminum. The list of these products can be found here ( here ) INDIAN TARIFFS ON UNITED STATES - India, the world’s biggest buyer of U.S. almonds, on June 21 raised import duties on the nuts by 20 percent and increased tariffs on a range of other farm products and U.S. iron and steel, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Indian steel.. U.S. TARIFFS ON TURKEY, TURKISH RETALIATION - The United States on Aug. 14 doubled its duty rate on Turkish steel to 50 percent and Turkish aluminum to 20 percent, citing national security concerns amid a deepening diplomatic dispute over the detention of an American pastor. Turkey, which already had imposed retaliatory tariffs on $1.8 billion worth of U.S. autos, coal, paper, almonds, machinery and other products, responded by doubling its own tariff rate on many of these goods.

Jenny McGrath,"If you’re creating recipes for people cooking in the U.S., you’ll probably take for granted that your audience will have a fridge, stovetop, and oven. (Almost 99 percent of U.S. households do, according to the Census Bureau.) But in Thailand and Vietnam, not every kitchen has an oven. “The kitchen is still very much cooking on the surface,” Jaimohan Thampi, head of digital transformation and Internet of Things at Electrolux Asia-Pacific, told Digital Trends. That means electric, gas, and induction cooktops. To cater to its diverse Asia-Pacific market, Electrolux partnered with SideChef, which makes a recipe app that includes voice commands, step-by-step videos, and integrated timers. For the new Electrolux Life mobile app, SideChef brought all those features and helped incorporate some of the appliance maker’s recipes. “There are certain recipes that are really customized for Electrolux appliances, like for instance the steam oven,” said Thampi. Before the launch of the app, all of Electrolux’s content for the region was only available on its website. The app will make user interaction more personalized. “I’m not giving you a recipe that you can’t cook because you don’t have an oven,” he said. The content will include both local and international dishes for cooks who want to learn new techniques. In the future, Electrolux plans for the app to help Asia-Pacific users with meal planning and grocery delivery. To help reduce food waste, the company’s chefs could create recipes that incorporate last night’s leftovers, for example. The U.S. arm of Electrolux recently partnered with Innit, which offers a similar connected kitchen experience. However, the manufacturer has been slower to embrace connected appliances than companies such as Whirlpool or LG. It does have a connected steam oven coming to some European markets, and it acquired smart sous vide maker Anova in 2017. The SideChef-powered Electrolux Life app launched July 10 in Singapore, and the company will roll it out to Australia in August, the Philippines in September, and to Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam before November. It’s not just translating the recipes into various languages that will take some time but also keeping in mind the availability of different ingredients and cooking resources of each country, said Thampi. Right now, the SideChef partnership is just for the Asia-Pacific market, but he said it could expand to other regions as well.","Electrolux has a diverse market, especially when it comes to the Asia-Pacific region.

Nicola Harley,"T he government is to establish a new product safety office to stop future Whirlpool-style faulty goods disasters. In a bid to offer further protection to consumers, the creation of the Office for Product Safety and Standards is set to ensure large-scale product recalls are dealt with more swiftly. It comes after almost three million Whirlpool customers were initially told faulty tumble dryers were safe to use before changing its advice. Some customers were then left facing long delays of almost a year to have their machines ""modified"" to make them safe. The firm had identified a safety issue with the products in 2015 in which excess fluff can catch the heating element in the machine and cause a fire, it led to the items being linked to a number of blazes in British homes. It is estimated up to 1m people still have the faulty dyers in their homes. The new office has now been established following calls from safety experts commissioned by the Government. The Working Group on Product Recalls and Safety, created in 2016 by former Consumer Minister Margot James, last year made a series of recommendations to improve the recalls process and the safety of consumer products. Neil Gibbins, Chair of the Working Group, said: “It has been my mission to make the public safe since I joined the fire service nearly 40 years ago. That’s why I’m pleased to see the Government respond to our recommendations with concrete steps to ensure the safety of consumers, now and in the future.” The role of the office, which will have a £12m a year budget, will be to identify consumer risks and manage responses to large-scale product recalls and repairs. In addition to providing support and advice for local authority Trading Standards teams, the Office will co-ordinate work across local authorities where action is needed on a national scale and will ensure the UK continues to carry out appropriate border checks on imported products once the UK leaves the European Union. Business Minister Andrew Griffiths said: “The new Office for Product Safety and Standards will strengthen the UK’s already tough product safety regime and will allow consumers to continue to buy, secure in the knowledge there is an effective system in place if products need to be repaired or replaced. “I thank the Working Group for their efforts to help improve product safety and I look forward to working with them in this new phase.” The Office will be based in the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and will start work immediately covering general (non-food) consumer product safety. It will work closely with the BEIS Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor John Loughhead, to ensure it has access to cutting-edge scientific and technical expertise.",The government is to establish a new product safety office to stop future Whirlpool-style faulty goods disasters.,2018-01-21T00:01:00Z,"{'id': 'the-telegraph', 'name': 'The Telegraph'}",Government creates new product safety office to stop future Whirlpool-style faulty goods disasters,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/21/government-creates-new-product-safety-office-stop-future-whirlpool/,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/01/20/TELEMMGLPICT000117512880-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg,the-telegraph,The Telegraph,whirlpool,1
"Sarah McGregor, Rick Clough","Whirlpool Corp. shares rose by the most in a month after U.S. trade officials recommended President Donald Trump impose tariffs on foreign-made washing machines that they say are undercutting domestic manufacturers. Commissioners from the the U.S. International Trade Commission, at a hearing in Washington on Tuesday, offered a range of choices within a three-year quota system for Trump, who is expected to issue a final ruling by early next year. The ITC officials suggested the U.S. impose a 50 percent tariff on imports of large residential washing machines above 1.2 million units. The rate would be lowered in subsequent years to 45 percent and then 40 percent. Two of the four commissioners also recommended an additional tariff of as much as 20 percent on imports below the 1.2 million-unit threshold. Shares of the Benton Harbor, Michigan-based appliance maker gained 2.2 percent to $168.88, the biggest one-day advance since Oct. 20. Whirlpool said in a statement that it’s encouraged by the ITC’s recommendations and is confident the Trump administration will take action “to prevent continued abuse of existing trade laws by companies that seek an unfair advantage over American workers.” The Whirlpool case is a test of Trump’s vow to crack down on countries that don’t follow international trade rules. The American appliances giant has accused Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. of selling washing machines in the U.S. at below fair-market value while shifting production around to avoid U.S. anti-dumping duties. LG Responds LG said in a statement Tuesday that it’s reviewing the ITC’s move, calling Whirlpool’s complaint an effort to restrain competition. Samsung also issued a statement Tuesday saying “any tariff would raise prices, provide fewer product choices and impair job creation at our South Carolina factory.” While the commissioners suggested excluding nations that have trade agreements with the U.S. from the tariffs, South Korea’s Samsung and LG brand washers would be affected because they largely are imported to the U.S. from manufacturing hubs in Vietnam and Thailand. The U.S. is currently in talks to renegotiate its trade pact with South Korea. Excluded from the import tariff recommendations are countries with which the U.S. has free-trade deals, including Australia, Canada, Mexico and Singapore, according to the ITC’s statement. The ITC’s recommendations ratchet up trade tensions with a key ally at a sensitive time between the nations on economic and geopolitical fronts. In addition to the U.S. pursuit of a free-trade agreement with South Korea, American diplomats are trying to work with their counterparts in Seoul to address North Korea’s nuclear program. In a so-called safeguard petition filed with U.S. trade authorities in May, Whirlpool alleged that Samsung and LG pursued a strategy of selling washing machines in the U.S. at artificially low prices. The South Korean companies would move production work between Asian countries to do an “end run” around U.S. anti-dumping laws, Whirlpool said. Creating Jobs The ITC, a federal agency that investigates trade disputes, ruled last month that growing imports of residential washing machines was causing “serious injury” to American manufacturers. Whirlpool says correcting the problem will help create U.S. manufacturing jobs. The case is the latest in an ongoing dispute extending back years between the appliances makers. Whirlpool alleged in 2011 that its overseas competitors received unfair government subsidies. In 2013, South Korea filed a World Trade Organization dispute challenging the U.S. Commerce Department’s calculations. It won a ruling from the WTO last year. The ITC’s washing-machine recommendation comes as it weighs a separate high-profile trade dispute between Boeing Co. and its overseas rivals. The commission is expected to make a decision next year on the plane maker’s claim that it was injured by Bombardier Inc.’s strategy of selling the C Series passenger jet at “absurdly low prices” in the U.S. The Commerce Department issued a preliminary ruling in September imposing duties on the Canadian aircraft. — With assistance by Jing Cao",Whirlpool Corp. shares rose by the most in a month after U.S. trade officials recommended President Donald Trump impose tariffs on foreign-made washing machines that they say are undercutting domestic manufacturers.,2017-11-21T23:50:56Z,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",Whirlpool Rises as U.S. Pursues Tariffs on Imported Washers,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/u-s-seeks-tariffs-on-washing-machine-imports-in-whirlpool-case,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iVDtA2T9wTio/v0/1200x800.jpg,bloomberg,Bloomberg,whirlpool,1
Andrew Gebhart,"Yes, that's a fabric tag on the side. 
KitchenAid
The latest entry in the growing crowd of smart displays comes from a surprising source -- KitchenAid. The home appliance brand, which is owned by Whirlpool, is at CES for the first time and it's rocking up at the smart home with an elegant-looking voice activated touchscreen complete with Google Assistant. 
The KitchenAid Smart Display has a sleek and understated design dominated by a 10-inch screen. It doesn't have the bold colors that you might hope for if you're a fan of the company's classic stand mixers, but the silver frame looks polished nevertheless. Even better, it's rated for IPX-5 water-resistance, so it can stand up to your kitchen's splashes.
Due out in the second half of 2019, the KitchenAid Smart Display will respond to your voice commands through Google Assistant. You can use the screen to watch videos on YouTube and make video calls. You can also use the touchscreen to control your smart home gadgets and search local restaurants. 
Joining a competent crowd
The touchscreen uses Android Things, Google's trimmed-down operating system meant for smart home gadgets. Every other third-party smart display with Google Assistant makes use of Android Things, so expect a similar set of features as the existing Lenovo Smart Display, the JBL Link View and the LG WK9. The Google Home Hub offers the same features and looks the same in practice, though it uses the Chromecast operating system.
The general competence of smart displays with Google Assistant bodes well for the KitchenAid smart display. Google makes good use of the screen to show you info after you ask a question. Controlling smart home devices is intuitive both with your voice and with touch. The smart displays we've tested will scroll through a customized slideshow of your pictures in ambient mode and they can walk you through each step of a recipe at your own pace. You can multitask and play music or watch a video while you cook and Google will save your place so you can check the recipe at any time.
Both the Lenovo Smart Display and the Google Home Hub are particularly good in the kitchen, because of that step-by-step recipe help and their stylish designs. The biggest challenge for the KitchenAid will be distinguishing itself from a crowded and competent field while using the same voice assistant and operating system.
What's different
The water resistance is a nice advantage that the others lack. The KitchenAid Smart Display also has exclusive extra cooking content courtesy of the Whirlpool-owned app Yummly. You'll be able to open Yummly with a voice command to the display, then you'll see personalized recipe recommendations based on your prior use of the app. Pick one, and Yummly can walk you through the cooking steps.
A new Yummly Pro service even offers video guides for certain recipes hosted by celebrity chefs. If you're a fan of the app, the Yummly integration might be enough reason to get the KitchenAid Smart Display over the others. Otherwise, Google Assistant's native recipes guides are great, so you won't be missing out on much by going with another option from the field.
Price is key
KitchenAid said the price of the Smart Display will be between $200 and $300. Where it lands in that range will make a big difference. Lenovo's 10-inch display costs $250, so KitchenAid's model could look like a bargain by comparison or have that much more to prove.
Either way, I'm excited to see KitchenAid jumping into the smart home biz, and bringing its cooking prowess and customary sense of style.

"USA TODAY, Edward C. Baig, USA TODAY","A hotel room can make a guest feel welcome by proactively addressing their needs once they step into the room. Watson Assistant can set the room temperature and make dining recommendations based on preferences from past stays, turn on the lights and close the blinds depending on the time of day. (Photo: IBM) IBM Watson is seeking to join the exclusive club occupied by Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant. At the IBM Think 2018 conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, IBM is set to announce the Watson Assistant, an artificial intelligent advisor that the company describes as an “AI enterprise assistant.” “Enterprise” is the key clue not to think of Watson Assistant has another Alexa or Siri but rather a new product tailored to IBM Watson partners. In that sense, Watson Assistant will mostly assume a behind the scenes role, at least where consumers are concerned. “We’re building this Watson Assistant offering so that automakers and hotels and electronics companies and other companies can put an assistant in their product or service in a way that brings real value to end users,” says Bret Greenstein, global vice president of Watson Internet of Things at IBM. So don't expect to summon the Watson Assistant by barking out “Hey Watson” or some similar trigger phrase. ""You're not going to be talking to Watson,"" Greenstein says. ""You're going to be talking to BMW or your Whirlpool appliance or whoever implements this for you."" You might talk to your hotel room though. For example, you may utter something along the lines of, “it’s too bright in here” and the lights will automatically dim, or the blinds may close. Or you may indicate that you’re hungry and receive dining suggestions based on past visits, with the those recommendations coming in via voice, or maybe text. A U.K. company called Chameleon Technology, which manufacturers displays for global smart meters, has created a digital assistant powered by the Watson Assistant called I-VIE that will set temperatures based around the time you’re scheduled to arrive and leave the house. “The technology is about understanding people, their words, their language, their tone, their intent, Greenstein says. IBM is launching Watson Assistant, an enterprise AI offering that businesses add to their products and services. Here a gentleman engages with the premium, digital cockpit featured in a Maserati GranCabrio. The Watson Personal Assistant is one of the features supported in HARMAN’s digital cockpit solution and gets to know the driver and their personal preferences. (Photo: Erik John Ricardo for Harman) Under some circumstances, Watson promises to chime in proactively, perhaps to tell you that the tire pressure in your car is low, or since you have an appointment in an hour, you might want to fill up the gas tank before you head over there. BMW and Harman are among the partners working with IBM Watson on various automotive solutions. Of course, knowing all there is to know about you raises privacy and security concerns. “In our model, data privacy is at the center of the solution,” Greenstein maintains. “Our clients own their own data....A lot of people have drawn a line and say `I don’t really want to integrate Alexa deeply into the car because then Amazon knows everything about all the data in the car.’” All the same, Greenstein doesn’t view Alexa as a Watson Assistant rival. Keeping that in mind, the Watson Assistant, along with Alexa, Siri and the Google Assistant, can all be members of the same exclusive club.

Nathan Grayson,"It was back when I was playing World of Warcraft in high school that I first realized I had a problem. My bags were always full, laden with old gear and miscellaneous baubles I just couldn’t bear to part with, even if that just meant putting them in storage for a bit. A random stone that reminded me of a great quest. A pair of gloves that took me back to my first raid with my guild, when they hazed me by convincing me I should leap to my death to reach a (fake) secret area. I’m sentimental nearly to a fault, something that’s come through in the way I play games for years. Only recently, however, have I seen games begin to really embrace the specific sort of nostalgia our adventures in their worlds can conjure. Lately, I’ve been playing a bunch of Mario Odyssey, and I love that the game allows me to purchase little souvenirs from each kingdom. Unlike the small junkyard of random armor scraps I dragged around in games like World of Warcraft or, more recently, single-player RPGs like The Witcher 3, Odyssey ’s souvenirs serve no purpose except to adorn your ship and remind you of where you’ve been. After hours and hours of hunting moons, it’s easy for locations to lose a bit of their magic, to become rigid, structured stages in your mind instead of living, breathing places. Silly as it might sound, though, I can go into my ship and glance at my inflatable rubber dinosaur toy from the Lake Kingdom and remember when I first arrived there, when I was sucked into a whirlpool of chill by the sheer serenity of the place. The creature my souvenir is based on, in fact, actually scared the crap out of me when I first encountered it. I was just swimming and vibing to the music when this immense blue monstrosity appeared in the corner of my eye. I nearly leaped out of my seat before discovering that it was actually a big, peaceful doof of a thing. The souvenir’s description, meanwhile, gives this relatively small kingdom a ton of life. “Fans of the universally loved Dorrie have been clamoring for a quality reproduction like this,” it reads. Glad to hear that the Dorrie fandom finally got their wish. Sentimentality can be a complicated feeling, a spectrum more nuanced than warm nostalgia or wistful tears. It can shift over time, reshaping your own tellings of the stories associated with those moments. Pyre, released earlier this year by Bastion and Transistor studio Supergiant, nails that in a really understated way with its own souvenir system. The game’s cast of characters is massive, and after one of them joins your team and starts traveling with you, they become associated with an item that decorates your wagon. Early on, your wagon is basically empty, bereft of personality and a couple bumps in the road from permanently breaking down. By the time you’re prepping for your last big journey up the mountain, though, the inside of your wagon looks like the tomb of some weird old king, overflowing with instruments, books, treasures, and heirlooms. Each one has personal significance, something made all the more powerful by the fact that by that point you’ve sent most of your team away permanently, and it’s been in-game years since you’ve seen some of them. One item, cooking tins once owned by a rogueish character named Hedwyn, reminded me of one of my biggest in-game regrets. I’d sent him away too early, thinking he’d want to be with his best friend, who was the first character I sent. He nearly broke into bitter tears upon receiving his freedom. Later, though, he helped lead a revolution and was finally reunited with his long lost love. When things were all said and done, those tins came to represent necessary sacrifice in my mind. Hedwyn struggled for our cause and nearly lost out on the things he cared about most, but it all paid off in the end. Pyre ’s souvenirs also do an excellent job of making a 15-hour game feel like an epic journey. When I finished the game, I was struck by the way this tiny tale managed to feel more momentous than many 100-hour behemoths. You can look at any item or area in that game and immediately recognize how far you’ve come, how little you knew when you first started out, how much you’ve lost, and how much you’ve gained. Divinity: Original Sin 2 doesn’t have a souvenir system, and yet its approach to sentimentality struck me more than any other game this year. Near the beginning of the game, you’re freed from what’s essentially a concentration camp for magic users, but you’re still stuck with a power-suppressing collar around your neck. When you finally find somebody to break it, it’s a huge symbolic moment, not to mention an important mechanical one. Obviously, being me, I kept my broken collar in my inventory. I didn’t think I’d ever need it, but why not? 15 or 20 hours of playtime later, in an entirely different act of the game’s plot, I came across a group of kids playing in the street of a town. They were pretending to be magic users and the jerkholes who hunt/imprison/turn society against them. I approached them and was surprised to find that the game offered me the option to give my broken collar, this junk item that I imagine most players just got rid of, to the kids to enhance their imaginary game. I decided to hand it over, and the kids just about lost their shit. Holding onto memories and mementos is all well and good, but you’ve got to know when to let them go, too.","It was back when I was playing World of Warcraft in high school that I first realized I had a problem.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are higher Tuesday morning as investors applaud strong first-quarter results from companies including machinery maker Caterpillar, appliance maker Whirlpool and Fifth Third Bancorp. Smaller companies made big gains in an optimistic sign for the U.S. economy. Bond yields continue to rise and the 10-year Treasury note reached 3 percent for the first time in more than four years. Alphabet, Google's parent company, slid after it reported greater revenue but also an increase in spending. KEEPING SCORE: The S&amp;P 500 index gained 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,675 as of 9:55 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,492. The Nasdaq composite added 13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,141. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 8 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,570. MACHINE POWER: Caterpillar said the strong global economy helped its sales of construction and energy industry machinery and it raised its forecasts for the year. It also said prices rose and its stock jumped 3.3 percent to $159. Appliance maker Whirlpool also surpassed expectations and rose 5 percent to $157.80.

Nick Turner,"Whirlpool Corp. delivered a disappointing earnings forecast on Wednesday, undercutting some of its momentum after a trade victory earlier this week. The appliance maker expects earnings of $14.50 to $15.50 a share this year, excluding some items. That fell short of the $15.56 analysts were predicting. The outlook suggests that Whirlpool’s business is still in the spin cycle following setbacks on several fronts. The company has seen its cost of materials rise at a time when consumers are gravitating toward lower-priced machines. It also ended a century-old partnership with the ailing Sears Holdings Corp. in October, and Whirlpool has struggled to digest its acquisition of Italy’s Indesit SpA business. The shares fell as much as 5.9 percent to $168.50 in late trading immediately after the forecast was released, though they later pared the losses. The stock was up 6.1 percent this year through Wednesday’s close. Whirlpool received good news earlier this week when the Trump administration imposed a tariff of up to 50 percent on large residential washing machines, a penalty aimed at imports from rivals Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Michigan, said it would add domestic manufacturing jobs in the wake of the move. Trade and domestic manufacturing were signature issues in Donald Trump’s campaign for the White House, and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Fettig served as a member of the president’s now-disbanded manufacturing council.","Whirlpool Corp. delivered a disappointing earnings forecast on Wednesday, undercutting some of its momentum after a trade victory earlier this week.",2018-01-24T22:09:14Z,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",Whirlpool's Disappointing Forecast Undercuts Its Tariff Win,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-24/whirlpool-s-disappointing-forecast-takes-shine-off-of-tariff-win,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iGuDSxlwFJiQ/v1/1200x717.jpg,bloomberg,Bloomberg,whirlpool,1
Tyler Lacoma,"Electric cooktops are versatile, easy to clean, and thanks to modern technology, come with a variety of tricks like fast heat-ups and syncing elements. If you’re looking for a new cooktop, an electric option (not to be confused with induction technology) is a good choiceand our list can help you make the right decision. Check out today’s top models.
Reminder: Cooktops are not one-size-fits-all. Most residential cooktops come in 30 and 36-inch models. Even then, there can also be small variations between brands that may make fitting a new cooktop more complicated. When in doubt, consult a professional before buying.
GE Appliances PP9036DJBB 36-inch
GE Appliances’ excellent five-burner cooktop gives you a variety of options to fit every pot and pan you have along with some impressive tech features. The middle burner has three optional size options that are certain fit extra-large pots. The two-sized side burner is a “power boil” 2,400-watt element designed to apply extra heat to bring things to a full boil. The two side burners are actually “sync burners” that you can control at the same time and heat levels, ideal for heating griddles or similar objects. The glide touch controls may take some getting used to, but they do have a handy lock option so you don’t accidentally adjust the heat after turning them on. Overall, this cooktop combines the benefits of electric heating with the best of recent innovations in cooktop technology, making it an easy recommendation.
Samsung NZ36K7570RS 36-inch
Some do not like the glide touch control system, which takes time to get used to. If you’d rather avoid touch dial options, this model offers more traditional dials as well as digital touch controls, thanks to removable magnetic knobs a neat solution. It also provides some of the same benefits as our top GE Appliances pick, including two sync burners for griddles and a rapid boil burner (3,300 watts) for quickly heating up your liquids. The Bluetooth feature links to Samsung oven ranges so that it can automatically turn on lights and fans when you start using the cooktop also neat. There’s also Wi-Fi connectivity for remote control of the burners, which have 15 different heat settings, making this one of the most high-tech electric tops we’ve seen.
GE Appliances JP3030SJSS 30-inch
While the offset four burners may look at a little odd, this GE cooktop sports impressive, durable knob controls and powerful heating elements (no multi-size elements here, unfortunately), plus an excellent design with stainless steel trim. Two of the elements are power boil options at 2,500 watts for fast heating. The lowest settings allow you to simply keep food warm with the six-inch element, or gently melt foods with other elements.
Electrolux EI36EC45KS 36-inch
Two of these Electrolux elements have multiple size options to choose from, with a variety of wattage options for different cooking projects. However, the real star here is the set of powerful controls. These controls combine on and off touch switches, preset touch settings to immediately choose temperatures for specific tasks, and gliding controls to adjust temperatures. With a little of everything, these touch options give you unprecedented control over the cooking processand since everything is smooth, cleaning is easy, too. A Sabbath Mode is also included.
Whirlpool W5CE3024XB 30-inch
This highly affordable electric cooktop makes a great option for a budget upgrade to your kitchen. The knob controls allow you to choose options like simmer and melt depending on the elements you are using and you can easily remove the knobs for dishwashing when things get dirty. There aren’t a lot of extra features on this cooktop, but the solid, reliable Whirlpool design still carries it far.
Frigidaire FFEC3024LB 30-inch
Another affordable model for those looking to save, Frigidaire provides a basic electric cooktop with a simple design. You won’t find any bells or whistles on this model, but you do get elements ranging between 1,200 and 2,500 watts, plus easy-to-use knob controls on the right-hand side. It heats up quickly, is easy to clean, andfor those who aren’t interested in introducing new complexities into the kitchendoesn’t require any extra training to use immediately.
LG LCE3010SB 30-inch
On the other hand, if you like the high-tech controls, this LG cooktop will ensure your Sci-Fi dreams come true. The touch-based control panel looks more like something you would find in a spaceship than a kitchen, with an arc of gliding dials that lets you immediately control the five different elements and see what state they are in at a glance. Multi-size elements and syncing elements are also included, as well as a “keep warm” setting, a child lock to prevent tampering, and auto shut off for safety.","Looking for the best electric cooktops?

Jordan Minor,"Food, its good! Setting aside the fact that eating is a biological necessity, food is this awesome way to engage our senses. Whether eating alone or sharing with others, food is art and culture. Food is an unchanging primal need but its also ever-evolving as people evolve, and one of biggest drivers of human evolution is the rapid pace of technology. Using fire to cook food is a tech innovation.
These days food tech is all around us, from microwaves we scream at to intelligent refrigerators to sealing food with a vacuum to more evenly cook it or something. And at CES 2019 manufacturer Whirlpool Corporation, under its WLabs brand, gave attendees a taste at some future food tech it has cooking.
The WLabs Smart Countertop Oven is basically what it sounds like. Its a small kitchen appliance with lots of big features for more intelligent baking and broiling. Theres a real-time video feed for checking food as its cooks. The oven monitors internal temperature to keep food healthy but not overdone. Algorithms for different foods, including frozen foods, allow the oven to preheat itself to keep cooking times as efficient as possible. And the oven integrates with voice assistants like Google Home and Alexa. It ships in 2019 for $799.
If you dont want to ditch your full-size oven you can also augment it with the Whirlpool Connected Wall Oven. This adds a transparent screen through which you can view all sorts of helpful apps while cooking. Navigate the interface to find recipes, shop for deliveries, view cooking instruction videos, and check how cooked your food is. You can also adjust the interface depending on your space. Whirlpool describes this as an augmented reality concept without a release date or price.
And if you still have food leftover you can reduce your waste with the Zera Food Recycler. With the appliance and app available in 2019, users can make sure leftovers are turned into usable compost and fertilizer in about a day. Between this and the SportsArt energy-generating treadmill, its a big CES for saving the planet if its not already too late.","Food, it’s good!

David Graver,"In the ever-changing New York City skyline, one dual-tower residential skyscraper features a curious and highly uncommon attribute that warrants extra attention. Connecting the American Copper Buildings is the first new skybridge NYC has seen in 80 years. The three-story addition stretches 100 feet between the dancing buildings, 300 feet up from the ground. Inside, one finds a handful of unexpected attributes and design fit for such a spectacle. JDS Development Group partnered with SHoP Architects on the entire project and the only way the truly understand an attribute like the skybridge is to step inside—an experience we were lucky enough to have. Before climbing to the 28th floor, however, it's worth addressing other attributes in the residence. Some of the towers—the west, which has been open since March 2017 and the east, which will open this spring—has already begun to patina lightly, a product of their copper-clad facade and an exciting continued development. One structure rises 41 stories, the other 48—each with a four degree kink. There are seven different sizes of patterned, punched windows lending a truly distinct exterior. And its united form seems to shape-shift from different angles; slender in parts and sturdy in others. It's eye-catching and makes for an eccentric addition to the East River waterfront, which has of late been developed at a much faster pace on the Brooklyn side. Function led to invention here. Zoning wouldn't allow the developers to connect the two buildings at grade. Creating two separate buildings—with two separate systems—was cost prohibitive. The solution became a skybridge. Traditionally, a walkway between residences and commercial spaces, or the connective tissue between offices, the skybridge has faded from city architecture over the years, with some last standouts being removed because of maintenance costs. This one, however, has something more afoot and longevity innately set. Perhaps surprisingly, the top of the skybridge offers just three private outdoor spaces for residents—yielding views of the river on one side and the city on the other. One on floor inside, there's one of the most talked about amenities in the real estate market: a 75-foot indoor lap pool that literally lets users swim from one building to the other. There's something novel about the idea, but experiencing it underscores the fact that this is a luxury rental where excitement was taken into consideration. The lap pool is accompanied by a whirlpool hot tub and a Turkish-style hamman with a plunge pool. SHoP also did the interiors and their use of chevron patterning appears in the pool and one level above in the residents' lounge, where textures and bright colors play with the natural light. And all furnishings were selected by k&amp;co. This lounge plays host to a bar, as well as a catering kitchen, juice bar and more. Uniting the indoor floors is Copper Tone—a double-height fitness center. There are dozens of machines, placed before stunning city views, and a rock wall extending between two floors. All of it is managed by La Palestra. From yoga to massages and private studio spaces, they can be procured on site in the skybridge. Some may be turned off by the idea of another luxury rental in the city, but American Copper lends something special to the skyline. And while regular rates are standard for what's being offered ($3,650 for studios, $4,800 for one bedrooms, and $6,750 for two bedrooms) the building is a part of the 80/20 Housing Program—and potentially accessible to those who dream of it via the housing lottery.

Nicole Lee,"Created by W Labs, Whirlpool's innovation incubator, the Whirlpool Connected Hub Wall Oven has a 27-inch transparent LCD interface on the front where a typical oven door would be. So you can still use it like a regular oven, but now you can also use it to view family calendars, or check out personalized recipe suggestions. According to Whirlpool, if it notices that there's only a 45-minute window for dinner, it'll suggest shorter, faster recipes too. And, of course, it's smart enough to only recommend recipes that fit within your dietary restrictions. There's even step-by-step video instructions via Whirlpool's Yummly platform that you can watch directly on the oven's screen.
The whole augmented reality part of the equation comes in when cooking. If you're a novice, for example, the oven will provide instructions right there on the screen on what rack to use or which cooking cycle. Or if you're following a step-by-step cooking guide provided by Whirlpool, it'll notify you right on the LCD screen what the next step is. Additionally, there's an ""internal vision system"" that essentially lets you zoom in on the food that's cooking to check out how it's coming along.
That's not the only thing Whirlpool is announcing. The company is adding even more features to its aforementioned Yummly app. For one thing, it's no longer just an app, it's now a full-on platform that serves both Whirlpool and KitchenAid brand appliances. There's an ingredient recognition feature that'll bring up just the right recipes based on what it detects if you happen to have a smart oven or a smart fridge, a new meal planning feature, and, of course, voice command capabilities so you can interact with that recipe without interrupting your cooking prep.
Not many people know that Whirlpool is also the brand behind KitchenAid, and it too is debuting a few high-tech items at CES. KitchenAid already revealed its Google-powered smart display yesterday, and now, it's set to reveal it's first-ever connected oven. It's simply called, well, the Smart Oven+, and you can install it in either single, double or combination oven configurations. 
It features a 4.5-inch LCD display that lets you view and select a variety of different functions, and there's a KitchenAid companion app that you can use to remotely control the oven's timer or to simply keep tabs on how long until dinner will be ready. Of course, like a lot of other smart appliances these days, the KitchenAid Smart Oven can also be controlled via voice command; either through Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa. 
On top of all these smart features, the Smart Oven+ also has powered attachments for grilling, steaming and even a baking stone attachment, all of which promise better-cooked foods. Other functions include Yummly app integration and a convection oven mode. 
Plus, Whirlpool is debuting yet another smart washer and dryer. The latest version from the appliance giant is the Smart Front Load Laundry Pair, a washer and dryer outfitted with a touchscreen interface, detergent storage and, yes, voice control capabilities. Just like a lot of other appliances here at CES, you'll be able to talk to your Laundry Pair via Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant. You can use your voice to ask how long the laundry is going to be, or maybe to add an extra rinse cycle. 
As mentioned, it also has a ""Load and Go"" dispenser that you can load with detergent for up to 40 or so loads, so you can automatically dispense what's needed with a single press of a button. What's more, you'll be able to control your laundry with the Whirlpool app. It'll offer suggestions like the right kind of dryer setting for your load, assign family members laundry day tasks, and you can refer to a handy stain guide to know just how to treat that red wine spill. And, there'll also now an Amazon Dash laundry replenishment feature in the Whirlpool app too.
The connected hub wall oven is still a concept for now, and might never make it to your local kitchen store. The new and improved Yummly app, however, is available now. Pricing for the washer and dryer and the KitchenAid smart oven haven't been announced yet, but they're all set to debut in 2019.","These days, Whirlpool is more than just ovens and dishwashers.

newsfeedback@fool.com (Rich Smith),"Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope... Spring is in the air, and that should be good for the construction business -- should, but not will, according to Goldman Sachs. This morning, the analyst climbed up on its soapbox and knocked down three key stocks tied to the fortunes of the construction industry. Whirlpool ( NYSE:WHR ) and Apogee Industries ( NASDAQ:APOG ) were cut to sell, while Owens Corning ( NYSE:OC ) got dropped to neutral. Here's what you need to know. Construction stocks got put through the wringer this morning. Construction stocks like...Whirlpool? Image source: Getty Images. Whirlpool Let's begin with Whirlpool -- probably the best-known brand name among the three stocks downgraded today. As Goldman Sachs explains in a note covered on StreetInsider.com (subscription required) this morning, the construction industry is approaching its ""mid-cycle,"" with less upside ahead of it than behind. Whirlpool probably isn't the most obvious standard bearer for construction stocks. Still, given that new houses (and apartments) often need to be outfitted with new washers and dryers, you can see why Goldman Sachs would decide to include Whirlpool in its analysis of this industry. Whirlpool may soon benefit from the Trump administration's recent decision to impose tariffs on competing major home appliances imported from Korea, but the analyst doesn't seem to think that this positive outweighs the negatives. According to the analyst, Whirlpool faces problems in the form of ""raw material inflation"" (which compresses its profit margin on the costs side) and ""higher competition"" (which limits its pricing power on the revenue side). Goldman Sachs now rates Whirlpool stock a sell, and with a $135 price target, appears to be expecting the stock to decline by about 10% over the next 12 months. Apogee Enterprises In contrast to Whirlpool, window maker Apogee Enterprises is more obviously tied to the construction industry. Unfortunately, though, it's tied to a sector of the construction industry that Goldman Sachs believes is heading toward tough times. Private, non-residential construction, says the analyst, has been on a tear over the past five years, growing roughly 8% annually over this period. Unfortunately for Apogee, Goldman Sachs believes this growth ""will flatten in 2018/19,"" removing a tailwind for the company. At the same time, and similarly to the situation with Whirlpool, the analyst warns that raw material costs and ""elevated fixed-costs"" will combine with greater competition to cause Apogee Enterprises' profit margin to disappoint going forward. Indeed, Apogee's margin is already doing just that. According to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, Apogee's gross profit margin has declined year over year in each of the past four reported quarters, and for 2017 as a whole, after climbing steadily for six years straight. Should 2017 turn out to be the first year of a new multiyear trend -- this one going down -- Apogee shareholders may find themselves headed for a new perigee in stock price. Goldman Sachs rates this one a sell as well, and predicts Apogee shares will shed about 5% of their value over the course of the next year, falling to $39 a share. And finally, Owens Corning Last but not least, Goldman Sachs says it's cutting its rating on insulation maker Owens Corning -- albeit only to neutral, and with a price target of $90 that actually seems to suggest that there's another 13% or so worth of upside to the stock. So why downgrade it at all? Continuing its theme of margin worry, the analyst says it sees little room for Owens Corning to expand its profit margins in the near term, which limits its enthusiasm for the stock. In contrast, Goldman Sachs doesn't seem too concerned about the fact that Owens Corning's stock price has gained 33% over the past year. Is that a mistake? Valuing the prospects Valued at $9 billion in market capitalization, Owens Corning stock sells for an apparently rich price-to-earnings ratio of 31. The good news, though, is that Owens Corning is a powerful cash machine, generating $679 million in positive free cash flow (FCF) last year. Valued on these cash profits, Owens Corning sports a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of only 13.2. Even dinging the stock for its $2.2 billion in net debt, Owens Corning's resulting enterprise value-to-FCF ratio of 16.5 doesn't look excessive in light of analysts' expected 15.1% growth rate and Owen Corning's modest 1% dividend yield. In this case, Goldman Sachs' neutral rating is appropriate. In contrast, Whirlpool's valuation looks stretched at 30 times earnings and 18 times free cash flow (and 12% projected growth). Apogee -- likewise expected to grow earnings at 12% annually over the next five years -- seems similarly expensive at a valuation of 15 times earnings and 22 times free cash flow. In both these cases as well, I can't help but agree with Goldman Sachs' conclusion: The stocks are too expensive and deserve to be sold.","The weather is warming, but the construction boom is cooling off.",2018-04-04T17:50:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fool.com'}","Goldman Sachs Sours on Construction: Whirlpool, Apogee, and Owens Corning Stocks Downgraded",https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/04/goldman-sachs-sours-on-construction-whirlpool-apog.aspx,https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F478132%2Fwashing-machine-wringer.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize,,Fool.com,whirlpool,1

Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.
Max Tunnicliff -- Senior Director of Investor Relations
Thank you, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the investor section of our website at whirlpool.com.
Before we begin, I'll remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports.
We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations.
We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask the participants to ask no more than two questions.
With that I'll turn the call over to Marc.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks and good morning everyone. On Slide 3 we show our fourth quarter highlights. As you saw in our press release, we delivered strong results for the quarter, including a record ongoing EPS of $4.75. Excluding currency we delivered revenue growth of 2.5% driven by very strong price/mix actions across all regions, as we continued to realize the benefits of the actions we initiated earlier in 2018.
Additionally, our North America region continued to deliver impressive results, driving 5% revenue growth while again expanding EBIT margin 40 basis points despite a soft industry and significant cost inflation.
In Europe, we drove sequential quarterly improvement in volume and EBIT margins which were in line with our expectations, as we began to benefit from previously announced actions directed at returning the region to profitability.
Lastly, I want to remind you that our prior year results included the benefit of certain tax credits in our Latin America region, a 50 basis point positive impact to our fourth quarter 2017 consolidated EBIT margin.
Turning to Slide 4, I will discuss our full year highlights. We delivered solid global results and expanded margins in North America despite a number of challenges such as, softer than anticipated industry, significant cost inflation, trade tariffs and currency volatility. In total, these challenges amount to an approximately 200 basis point impact. Additionally, our performance in Europe was worse than expected and drove a miss in revenues and margins for the Corporation.
Faced with these challenges, we quickly adapted our plans and took strong actions to address and offset them. These actions included; strong execution of our previously announced cost-base price increases, delivering on our fixed cost reduction initiatives, refocusing and rightsizing our European business, and continuing in our disciplined approach to capital management.
Lastly, we delivered very strong free cash flow of $853 million for the year, driven by disciplined working capital management, including significant improvement in inventory and the favorable timing of certain payments. The actions we took in 2018 coupled with favorable exit rates in Europe gave us confidence that we would deliver results in 2019 that put us back on track to our long-term goals.
Turning to Slide 5, we show further details of our margin performance, which we highlighted on the previous slides. Full-year margins positively benefited from the successful execution of our global price/mix and innovative product launches throughout the year, impacting margins by approximately 200 basis points.
Additionally, our previously announced fixed cost reduction actions continue to progress in line with expectations. As a result of a strong price/mix and cost reduction actions, we successfully offset the significant raw material, tariff and currency challenges we faced throughout the year.
Now, I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results.
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Marc, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review the fourth quarter results for our North America region. We delivered very strong results in the quarter with both revenue growth and margin expansion despite continued challenges in the external environment. Net sales increased 5% despite negative industry demand.
Overall, we expanded our ongoing EBIT margin approximately 40 basis points, as we overcame more than 150 basis points of cost inflation. Our ability to once again deliver strong margin expansion, regardless of external volatility and significant inflation, demonstrates the fundamental strength of our North America business.
Turning to Slide 8, we review the fourth quarter results for our Europe Middle East and Africa region. Excluding (ph) the impact of currency, net sales were down 6%, but reflect sequential quarterly improvement. EBIT margins were positively impacted by continued year-over-year price/mix improvement, which was more than offset by approximately 225 basis points of cost inflation and currency. We delivered sequential EBIT improvement as we began to experience the benefits of our actions centered around stabilizing volume. I will provide an update on these and other actions later in the guidance portion of this presentation.
Now, we turn to Slide 9 to review the fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased approximately 1%, driven by share gains and positive price/mix. Our underlying home appliance business drove EBIT margin expansion which was more than offset by approximately 300 basis points of cost inflation and currency. Also, prior year results were favorably impacted by the sale and monetization of approximately $30 million in certain tax credits.
We now turn to the fourth quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on Slide 10. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased 11%, as we benefited from unit growth and share gains in India. EBIT margins declined as strong price/mix was more than offset by raw material inflation and an increase in our bad debt provision.
Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks Jim. On slide 12, we review our guidance assumptions for 2019. In line with our long-term goals, we expect to drive net sales growth of approximately 3%, adjusted for the divestiture of our Embraco compressor business and the carry over impact of currency. In addition to previously announced pricing actions, we're bringing innovative and compelling product launches across all regions in 2019 which will positively impact mix.
We expect to deliver ongoing EBIT margins of 6.5% to 6.8%, a 40 basis point increase compared to 2018 and free cash flow of $800 million to $900 million, progressing strongly toward our long term cash conversion goal.
Turning to Slide 13, we highlight the drivers of our ongoing earnings per share expectations of $14 to $15. As you can see on this chart, there are certain elements which make our 2018 ongoing earnings per share not fully comparable to our 2019 EPS guidance. Most notably is our tax rate assumption of 15% to 20 % compared to 6.6% in 2018 as well as the absence of Embraco business for three quarters of the year.
At the same time, the EPS measure has a carryover benefit from share buybacks in 2018, while at this point we have not included a specific number for share buybacks in 2019. The ongoing EBIT margin expansion is expected to drive approximately $1 earnings-per-share growth, which I will discuss in further detail on the next slide.
Turning to Slide 14, we show the drivers of our EBIT margin improvement in 2019. We expect approximately 150 basis point improvement related to continued price/mix benefits and net cost improvement of 75 basis points as our fixed and ongoing cost reduction initiatives remain on track.
If macroeconomic pressure is remaining elevated, we continue to expect an increase of approximately $300 million in raw material inflation and tariffs, and would anticipate additional investments in our brands and products in support of upcoming product launches. We're confident that we have put the right actions in place to drive margin expansion in 2019
Now, Jim will cover our regional guidance and cash priorities.
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Marc. On Slide 15, we show our regional industry and EBIT margin guidance for the coming year. Starting with industry demand, we anticipate continued economic and trade uncertainty to temper overall demand resulting in moderate but positive industry growth of approximately 1% globally, with the exception of our Latin America region, where we expect a strong improvement in consumer demand. As previously discussed, we expect to deliver margin expansion across every region, driven by price/mix actions and strong cost takeout.
Turning to Slide 16, I'd like to update you on the strategic actions we announced last quarter to refocus our EMEA business and return to profitability. First, we have taken specific actions to stabilize volume across the core EMEA business. We saw volume improvement in the second half compared to the first half of 2018 and we expect volumes to be positive in the first quarter of 2019.
Discussions with our trade customers are focused on recovering floor spots lost during the peak of the integration. These negotiations began late in the fourth quarter of 2018 with the majority expected to be completed by the end of Q1. Our efforts to refocus marketplace investments toward our most profitable segments are on track to deliver benefits throughout 2019.
Second, looking at the bottom half of the slide, we are on track with the strategic actions we announced last quarter to refocus and right-size our EMEA business. The exit of Turkish domestic sales operations and Hotpoint branded small appliance businesses is in process and is on track to conclude by the end of Q2. And we are actively marketing our South Africa operations for a potential sale. Finally, the previously announced $50 million fixed cost reduction initiative for the region is on track.
As a result of all these actions, we expect to drive approximately $100 million in annualized EBIT improvement in EMEA before exit costs. For 2019, we expect to realize approximately $75 million for this first year of implementation and $100 million in total gross benefits thereafter.
From a quarterly earnings perspective, we anticipate year-over-year EBIT improvement in the first quarter and expect to be around breakeven in the second quarter. We are firmly committed to improving our regional cost structure and restoring profitability in EMEA, placing us back on track toward our long term margin targets for the region.
Turning to Slide 17, I will discuss the drivers of our 2019 free cash flow. We expect cash earnings to positively impact free cash flow as margin expansion is partially offset by the sale of Embraco. Additionally, we remain committed to driving sustainably lower working capital, which is expected to result in $200 million of working capital improvement in 2019. We also anticipate lower cash outlays as major restructuring initiatives wind down.
Lastly, free cash is impacted by several one-time items, which have a neutral impact to cash, overall. These items are explained in more detail in the appendix of the slide presentation. In total, we expect to drive $800 million to $900 million in free cash flow, excluding the anticipated proceeds from the sale of Embraco.
Turning to Slide 18, we show our capital allocation priorities for the year. We remain committed to fully fund the business for growth while maintaining strong cost discipline across all regions. Additionally, we continue to expect to close the sale of Embraco compressor business in early 2019 and use the anticipated proceeds to pay down debt.
Consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation, we intend to continue share buybacks albeit at a moderate pace, while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade rating and optimal capital structure as we target a gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.
Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
(Operator Instruction) Your first question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Michael Dahl -- RBC Capital Markets. -- Analyst
Good Morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to start off on the North America guidance and what you guys are thinking from a price and a volume perspective, just given some of the moving pieces in the industry, tariffs rolling off, new capacity coming online, some of the other items.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning Michael. It's Marc. So, let me maybe just talk a little bit about the 2019 North America guidance. First of all, as you've seen we guide toward a very strong EBIT margin of 12 % plus and we expect the industry to grow approximately 0% to 1%. Let me just elaborate on both items; with 12%, it's pretty close to where we're already running at 2018. As you've seen also Q4, we had 11.8%. On a GAAP basis, we're even above 12%.
So even in the somewhat softer than expected market environment which we experienced in Q4, we are pretty close and we're already running at 12%. So we're highly confident with 12%-plus. And that is also result of the carryover of a pricing which we had in 2018 and the effects of previously announced price increases in Kitchen segment which were -- it came into effect late December.
So there's a significant portion of carryover benefit from a pricing, coupled with what we still expect to be a somewhat inflationary cost environment. But at the same time, we're having confidence that we're getting more and more traction on the cost takeout actions. The combination of that leads to a further expansion of margins.
And on the industry, as you see we're guiding 0% to 1% and that is on the back of what I would say a stable replacement market and housing market which as you've seen in Q3 and Q4 went somewhat sideways, but we -- as we also said in the previous earnings call, we're not surprised about the sideway moves of the housing market, we're still fundamentally bullish on the long-term demand driver of US housing market. So -- and that probably explains the broader context.
Now particularly with regards to tariffs and I presume you're talking about the laws on tariffs, the 201 tariffs. First of all, as we already indicated, one competitor was already fully kind of live and up and running kind of Q3, Q4, so we wouldn't see any further changed or impacting the marketplace and the other one has been partially online. So I don't expect dramatic changes coming out of this one because we've seen already most of that.
With regards to the other tariffs and that may be also a point of clarification for just the broader guidance. We, at this point, have included the tariffs as they have been announced or as they have been communicated by the government, which also includes the 301 List 3 part, which is supposed to go to 25%, I think early March. So we have fully factored that in, but also recognize, of course, there's a lot of uncertainty or moving parts on the tariff side.
Michael Dahl -- RBC Capital Markets. -- Analyst
Got it, lot of helpful information. And then, just a quick follow up. When thinking about the overall guidance and the different moving pieces in there from the segment region, I think if you look at it from a segment standpoint there's upside to the numbers. So, on a consolidated basis, is there somewhere that you guys are baking in conservatism or is there another moving piece that would help explain how to square away all of these numbers to the consolidated range?
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And Michael, this is Jim. I think if you step back from it to begin with, as we give the different range on the regions, obviously there's some rounding that comes in there and all that. So, if you take it perfectly, you may get a little bit higher and lower than our overall range. Second is, we believe overall that guidance is set at the appropriate level. And again, as you look at the different regions, I think that's pretty close to where we expect to be. Outside of that, I think it's just rounding and nothing else in there.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Michael maybe -- it's Marc, maybe just elaborate a little bit further. First of all, stepping back on the guidance, and I think that's an important thing to note and recognize. As we said in our prepared remarks, the '19 guidance for EPS is not fully compatible with 2018, because there is a big element which just comes from what I call a more normalized tax rate of 15% to 20% and the absence of Embraco.
So you take these two elements out, that's basic $2.25. So that's, particularly when you look at the broader guidance, is a big element. Underneath that, we're still planning margin expansion, margin expansion on the back of pricing but also recognizing some cost elements.
So to Jim's point, I would call our guidance realistic but I think as we've evidenced in Q4 and hopefully what you hear, we're very confident. We're very confident and we're control of all the actions. We delivered good margin and good performance, also from cash flows side in Q4, despite the soft industry.
So we're highly confident but I also recognize there is uncertainty, as we experienced in 2018 there are probably going to be volatility in 2019. Right now I think volatility points more toward, call it upside risk i.e. raw material is going in right direction but we all recognize on the currency side on the raw materials, there is still a lot of uncertainty out there and that's what we have appropriately reflected in our guidance. But again, I want to reiterate, we are highly confident in our actions.
Michael Dahl -- RBC Capital Markets. -- Analyst
Understood. Thanks for taking the questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Susan Maklari -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Good morning.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Susan Maklari -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
In 2018, we saw you get really significant price action in North America especially sort of relative to the way the volumes came through. Can you just give us some color on how you're thinking about pricing in '19? I know that there'll be some sort of continued benefit that comes through from what we saw last year. But just how should we think about the breakdown in terms of pricing as we move through this year?
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Susan, it's Marc. So first of all, I want to also reemphasize, it's not just North America. We had globally very strong price/mix; actually across all four regions in Q4. So that's a pretty remarkable progress. Now, North America was particularly positive on the pricing side. And, to your point about 2019, there's a significant part which is carryover; carryover from the price increases which we announced early in the year.
And of course there's kind of a new announced price increase from kitchen which came in effect late December. As you also know, we're not making any forward statements about what we might or might not do in pricing. The only thing which I want to reiterate is we -- I do believe, based on our strong product pipeline and the product launches, we have significant mix opportunities ahead of us, beyond list price increases. So we're -- beyond the list price, our mix opportunities are big, our product pipeline is strong and we're confident behind that.
Susan Maklari -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Okay. And then, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more into the $300 million of raw material and tariff inflation in there. Can you just talk to what you've been seeing in steel, maybe any color around how much or to what extent you were able to lock in prices and how we should be thinking about maybe some tailwinds that could perhaps flow through over the next few quarters?
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Susan, it's Marc again and this all comes back to what we said in the previous earnings call, the $300 million as you rightly pointed out, is both a combination of raw material inflation and the effect of tariffs. So these are the two big components in there. On the raw materials, when we first kind of indicated $300 million, we took a forward assumption on raw materials into account. So we factored in a certain, call it normalization of steel prices and we also factored in a kind of improvement on particularly plastic prices, because as you know, these are the two big components in our raw material purchase.
So I think, sitting here today, well of course we saw the steel price coming down and plastics coming down, which is in line with pretty much what we expected. And given the kind of long nature of our steel contract we locked in I would say reasonably good conditions, but they still mean a year-over-year increase, because we're comparing not against spot but against kind of full-year average.
So we still have some increases, but I would agree right now, this steel and plastic are pointing in right direction, but as you also know, there is other raw materials which have a lot of volatility. The other big part which has not changed, because at this point we just don't have new information is the tariff landscape, the combination of 232 and the three different lists on 301. And as I mentioned earlier in my answer to Michael, particularly on 301, we have fully factored in a potential increase -- of a likely increase of 25% as of end of March or mid-March. So that is sitting in our -- in these assumptions, but frankly it's -- we can't speculate about whether it's happens or not. We right now took into account what is known and what has been communicated by the US government.

Next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Rehaut -- JPMorgan Securities, Inc. -- Analyst
Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning Michael.
Michael Rehaut -- JPMorgan Securities, Inc. -- Analyst
The first question, I just wanted to circle back a little bit and just make sure I'm thinking about the components of the margin guidance correctly. I think earlier, as kind of pointed out that, if you kind of sum up the regional components you'll get something maybe slightly above the 6.5% to 6.8%. By contrast actually, if you sum up the components of price/mix costs raw material inflation on Slide 14, you actually get right at the lower end of the range.
So obviously, it is a little bit of rounding, Jim, as you said -- are we just to take it that, each of the components on Slide 14 you might want to slightly -- that you're being a touch overly conservative. I'm just trying to understand how perhaps if you look at the components on Side 14 if there are any areas where, let's say price/mix, maybe it's not a 1.5 points, you're really thinking 1 point in 160 basis points, 170 basis points, if there are movement within those components that gets you little bit to the closer of the midpoint of the range?
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And Michael, this is Jim. I think as you start out, and you pointed out here that as you start to go through the different components there, and I think Marc highlighted this earlier in some of his answers is that, all of these are a point in time estimate and there's some variability within them. Right now as we look at RMI, we would say yes, based on what we've said we see the conditions similar to maybe slightly favorable. Tariffs are in the same situation, as we had expected before.
But there still could be some movement throughout the year in there. Net cost with inflation in there, again this is an approximation and we do expect to see obviously some variation in there. As you continue to work down the list there as I said, I think if you add up all the pieces, could it be 0.25 point (ph) either direction in aggregate? Yes, and that's why we put a range around this right now.
These are our best estimates at this point in time. If you look at across the different regions, I think also as we've said there that there's probably some rounding as you add it all up and try and get -- but we feel very comfortable, as Marc said, we feel very confident about the range we've given on EBIT margin. We feel very comfortable where it's coming in, that it reflects the best information we have today.
Michael Rehaut -- JPMorgan Securities, Inc. -- Analyst
Appreciate it. I guess secondly, I just also wanted to go back to price/mix more broadly. You talked about some of your expectations around the carryover of '18 price actions -- price/mix actions as well as new price increases effective the first quarter essentially. On the mix side, you also said -- you think you have some positive or upward potential there. I was hoping if you could just talk a little bit about the industry backdrop in North America right now from a mix standpoint, how it's trending?
One of the things that we've observed across different building product companies is somewhat of a negative mix shift or strength in lower price points across different building product sectors in 2018. I'm curious if you've seen any of that in the appliance world this past year from a mix standpoint and how your own business has performed against that and what you expect for the upcoming year?
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Michael, it's Marc and let me try to answer that. To your point about the building products and kind of more of the lower end growing, I would say in the pure new housing side I would see yes, there is some trends or some signs, but in particular, the first time buyers are coming more into the market which overall I would see as a good news and its demand which comes with a slightly lower mix.
But keep in mind, that it's only a fraction of our total markets, the new housing. On the broader base, we don't see that massive shift down. I actually would say, the broader mix is pretty stable. But then, I would also again point to -- back to what we're doing on product launches and innovation.
I mentioned in one of my earlier calls, we have, this year, for Whirlpool brand, an entire new global brand language for the kitchen products. We just launched a new front load washer -- an entire new front load washer platform in North America. And we will, in Q2, launch an entire new top loader line.
So we -- I think we're bringing out a lot of new products with a lot of innovation, which ultimately I think -- and that's our job to kind of bring the consumer to buy it and to mix up, and I think we feel very good about what we have in our pipeline.
Michael Rehaut -- JPMorgan Securities, Inc. -- Analyst
Great. If I could just sneak one more in; Embraco, what was the contribution from a revenue and profit standpoint in 2018, and I think you're only baking in one quarter of that in 2019?
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, I mean, right now, Michael we've assumed that that's about -- as we've said in our margin walk, our EPS walk, it's about $0.50, is the difference, so we pull that out. We have factored in approximately one quarter of that, and then, from a top line perspective, approximately $1 billion.

Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
David MacGregor -- Longbow Research -- Analyst
Yes sir. Good morning.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, David.
David MacGregor -- Longbow Research -- Analyst
Just, a high level question first of all and then I've got a follow-up. I guess, having covered you guys for a long time now, this is a pretty strong pricing environment and probably the strongest pricing environment I ever remember seeing with you in 20 years. And I'm just wondering if something has changed here with regard to the tariffs, you've got foreign manufacturers adjusting to US cost structures; you truly have an acceleration in new product introductions and innovation going on as well.
But the big risk to the 2019 guide seems to be your ability to hold on to pricing in the North American market. And I'm just wondering if something has changed structurally in the marketplace competitively that would suggest that maybe the industry as a whole has a little more pricing power. In other words, maybe the space is becoming a little more rational. What are your thoughts there?
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
David, it's Marc. So, I mean -- so yes, you're correct. In 2018, we had a very significant positive price/mix for the entire company. I also want to remind everybody; we had also very significant cost inflation out there. So it was a cost-based need (ph) and I think that explains a big part. The other part which, and I can't speak for the industry, I can speak for ourselves, we shifted, I would say, several years ago, where we said we will participate in promotion then we believe it creates value for us as company.
That policy hasn't changed even under pressure. I think that there is a strong commitment on our side to expand margins. We saw our cost increases reflected appropriately in the product pricing. And on top of that, and again I can't be -- stress that enough; we launched a lot of new products.
We invest every year $600 million in capital and almost the same amount in engineering and that ultimately pays off. I mean, we feel very good about our product pipeline. There is not a single platform in North America which I, right now would see as behind. We feel very good and that helps us often having these prices stick.
David MacGregor -- Longbow Research -- Analyst
Okay. Follow-up question, just regard to balance sheet, you talked about trying to get your leverage down to 2.0 or approaching 2.0 by the end of the year. Can you just talk about how that plays out in terms of your share repurchase plans versus deleveraging plans and what we should expect there?
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So David, this is Jim. And the first thing on the deleveraging that's obvious is when we close the Embraco transaction, that brings $1 billion worth of debt off our balance sheet within a very short period of time. The second thing is, we've highlighted we do expect our cash flows to be very similar to strong this year, so we'll have adequate free cash flow to handle all the various things we've talked about in our capital allocation from a cash -- and we've talked about that we want to get our debt levels closer to 2 and very close to 2 by the end of the year.
If you look at share buybacks, right now as we've said, while we don't give a solid number, we do say we'll continue to do it opportunistically throughout the year. I think if you look at the back half of 2018 that's probably a good example of how we intend to buy back shares at least in the near-to-mid-term on an ongoing basis.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And David, let -- it's Marc, let me maybe just add the Jim's point. First of all, I also want to underline, we have today a very strong balance sheet and our debt rating is a very solid one but it -- and this is consistent with what we have communicated for quite some time on capital allocation, we want to have directionally a balance sheet or a debt leverage of 2.
We will not be exactly at 2, but we will get pretty close to 2 by the year end, so we've have combination of strong cash flow, kind of the reversal of this Embraco related loan, and kind of a moderate share buyback that exactly leads it to do that level and that's, I think then we have a very strong balance sheet which leave firing power and prepares us for whatever might happen.
David MacGregor -- Longbow Research -- Analyst
Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James, please go ahead.
Sam Darkatsh -- Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst
Good morning Marc, good morning Jim. Happy New Year.
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning Sam, Happy New Year.
Sam Darkatsh -- Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst
I was kicked off earlier so I apologize profusely if you've already covered this, but I've got two questions and both of them have to do with Slide 5. So, first with net cost, for the year, it was a favorable 25 basis points to margin. But I think last quarter in October you were pegging that at 75 basis points for the year, which is a pretty significant swing. It's like $100 million negative variance. And I'm trying to piece together why that would have occurred in such a truncated period of time in the quarter. I'm guessing that there is some freight and warehousing in there, but could you talk about what happened with net cost in the quarter versus plan?
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Sam, this Jim and let me start off, and then Marc can add some color commentary here. I mean the first thing is, we had some of it that was just a shift from marketing and technology to net cost. But again, as I said, these are always approximate buckets and we had some movement within the different cost lines, but being close to where we expect it to be.
The other thing you've got to remember, if you look at our strong cash flow that we generated, a lot of that came through inventory reduction and that continued to put pressure on our net cost takeout throughout the fourth quarter and so it was slightly below where we'd expect it to be from a conversion perspective, but we had a significant benefit within working capital and inventory that we really felt was appropriate.
And the other thing that you highlighted is that we saw continued trends in inflation outside of raw materials, especially in logistics costs that continue to put pressure on those areas. So those are three of the big items that really caused that to move from where we thought it would be at the end of Q3 to where it was at the end of the year.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And Sam, the only thing which I want to add is -- one is on the tariff, and particularly if you compare the first half with second half, the tariffs largely sit in the second half. So that is -- what we saw in Q4 that's pretty much reflective of what we expect to see in Q1. The good news is we delivered North American margins with all the tariffs already being in effect.
Now the other point and again that's echoing what Jim was saying on the inventory, we drove, year-over-year, a very significant inventory reduction in a pretty much flat demand environment. So, depending on (inaudible) we have more than $400 million, actually close to $500 million inventory reduction.
You also know versus certain fixed cost leverage which is fairly significant, so kind of a negative impact of not having that production volume is fully sitting in these net cost elements. The good news is, we're starting the year with, I would say, very balanced inventory levels and we don't have to reduce that as we go into 2019.
Sam Darkatsh -- Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst
And my second question, the marketing and technology investments were ultimately trimmed, although again there may be some definitional things as you suggested Jim in the fourth quarter. But for 2019 guiding to a 25 basis point headwind, that seems like you're taking your discretionary expenses lower, especially in an area where one could argue it's designed for long-term growth and brand support. Is that you getting more efficient with marketing and technology investments or is that a decision you're making based on perspective of end-market activity and elasticity? Why take those investment spending numbers down?
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No. And Sam, I'd say you kind of hit the nail on the head on part of it there. We are becoming a lot more efficient in what I'll say is our R&amp;D or engineering spending and we've talked about that. Over the last few years the reorganization we've done in that group and how we've aligned to get more projects done with less spending and make ourselves much more efficient in that area.
We continue to invest significantly in our products. Additionally, in that space, there are some technology investments that we've had that can ebb and flow throughout periods of time especially with some of the integrations that we've done. And so we're seeing a slight reduction or a reduction in some of those as we wrap up some of the integration within EMEA. So those are the big drivers that we have there. But we do continue to invest in our products, significantly.
Sam Darkatsh -- Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst
And if I could sneak one more in real quickly. The Embraco sale proceeds, are they guaranteed no matter what the regulatory timing or ruling is ultimately on the sale?
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Sam, it's Marc. As you know and I think we mentioned that in one of our previous calls, the buyer is required by contract to do whatever is needed to get the regulatory approval by the end of April. So that is, technical English called hell or high water clause. So they have to take all actions necessary to get the regulatory approval. They got a lot of -- already a lot of regulatory approvals, but ones which are still missing is Europe and Turkey. But we're confident that the buyer will get it by end of April. So -- and then kind of that triggers this -- that happening that would mean the reversal of short-term loan which we took on the share buybacks last year.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Ken Zener -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Good morning gentlemen.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning Ken.
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.
Ken Zener -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Very solid North America margins, could you talk a little bit, Jim, maybe just to start, is there a first quarter or first half weighting ratio that we should be focused on? If I missed it I'm sorry.
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And Ken, we really haven't said anything about weighting. I think you should expect it to be similar to our normal pattern of seasonality within the year and especially as you look at Q1, just I would say it's going to be very similar to prior years. There's no distinct items. Obviously, Marc did mention earlier, the tariffs do weigh a little bit heavier in the first half of the year on us because they accelerated throughout the year. And we do have some additional interest costs within the first quarter due to the term loan we took out in the second quarter of last year, and we'll have that until we get the Embraco proceeds in. But outside of that, it's going to be relatively similar from an operational perspective.
Ken Zener -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Okay, appreciate that. Marc, you mentioned that -- I just want to be clear, because it affected another company that I cover. You said the 25%, I assume tariff increase, was fully priced in, could you go over that again in terms of -- clarify that as well as quantify that in case the 25% does not go through. I mean, is that -- how much is that worth if it doesn't go. I assume you're talking about the tariff?
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So ken, I mean as you know and given that you cover it quite extensively versus a lot of tariff components, there is the 232, there is 301 which had three different lists. And what we have factored in everything which has been communicated or announced at this point, which means basically everything on the 301, all three lists, including the increase to 25% off of famous List 3 of -- part of the 301 section. That is all factored in. We typically don't split kind of different components between List 1, List 2 and List 3. But it's needless to say that if List 3 stays at 10 % yes, that would be positive impact. But in total it's -- there is will be a headwinds, but it will be positive impact.
Ken Zener -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
All right. I'm just trying to get a little, because there was another company that had 10% and said that 25 % would be an x percent headwind. So if it doesn't go through I'm just trying to extract from you a -- perhaps benefit that might accrue to your guidance, but...
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Ken, maybe to just help you a little bit -- frame it a little bit more, in total and again, without going into all the details on the components. In total, you should assume the net of all tariffs right now weight about $10 million -- or $10 million to $12 million every month on us, and that's just the reality.
Ken Zener -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Every month?
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Every month. So the 301 is a part of it, and the 301 List 3 is part of that. So yes, if it would stay 10%, it will be a few million every month, and that will be good news, but in total, it's right now still a headwind.
Ken Zener -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Okay. And I think I'm going to cheat here, but -- so with AM flat kind of your guidance for this year, you have a positive outlook on housing fine. Can you split it up a little more in terms of the suites that you're selling, so steps that little more R&amp;R versus replacement demand and just quantificate on that a little. Thank you very much.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Now you've successfully sneaked in four questions. Having said that right now, again, we guide North America to a very modest growth of 0% to 1%; and that is against a housing market which is right now steadily moving sideways. However we expect the fundamental demand drivers to be intact and still are reasonably good; actually if we look at the numbers, actually very good consumer confidence.
With that in mind, on a pure -- in the traditions between replacements and discretionary, right now we see slightly more than half of our market around replacement and discretionary being less than half as a comparison but discretionary volume is still way below what we saw, for example, in 2005 or 2006 at the peak of appliance demands. So if you want to see so -- say so, I mean replacement is a pretty predictable number because that's just typically comes with a -- for life of appliances. So the discretionary -- yet in the long-term, you could argue still has some upside potential but we did not factor that in, in our '19 guidance.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Curtis Nagle from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Curtis Nagle -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. So, I guess just kind of the first one coming back to North America volumes. I guess could you give any color in terms of -- how things look from a cadence perspective given that's -- the comparisons are just a little bit choppy kind of quarter-to-quarter?
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Curtis, this is Marc. Let me first of all talk about Q4. As you've seen in Q4, frankly we expect the industry to be a little bit stronger in Q4, largely driven by, we expected Q4 industry to have probably a little bit more inventory load by retailers which did not happen to full magnitude. On the sell-through base in turn we probably would have expected a 1% to 3% sell through growth and probably now in Q4 the sell through from consumer perspective was probably around 0% to 1%. So a small change versus what we originally had in mind.
So I would expect also, on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you will see a plus or minus 1% up and down quarter-by-quarter. But having said that, the fundamental driver of consumer confidence in housing we considered to be intact. It doesn't mean that we will have a strong growth but we just don't see right now the scenario that you would have a significant quarterly contraction of the market. Again, we see consumer confidence and the fundamental drivers of demand being fairly intact.
Curtis Nagle -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Okay, fair enough. And just quickly go back to $300 million. I understand, I guess the basis of why it's still at $300 million, but let's just say hypothetically steel and perhaps resins continue to be weak and maybe get a little bit of relief there, would you have to pull back any of your cost-based price increases, say later in the year if that would happen?
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Curt, this is Jim, I'd say, right now, as we said we based the $300 million on what we've seen to date and what we expect obviously throughout the year different dynamics can drive that. The costing or the price increases that we've announced are based on the cost increases we've seen. And so at this point in time that's also our best estimate of that. Obviously, we -- throughout the year, as we see different trends within the marketplace around cost and all that, you know we'll update our guidance in those areas but there's a lot of different lines of volatility in addition our RMI that we're seeing today. As we mentioned tariffs, there's still some unknown on; currency, obviously some up and downs on; and inflation in other areas of our P&amp;L, especially around logistics and other areas that, that can fluctuate also. So at this time in aggregate, we really feel that in terms of what we're seeing in cost in terms of cost increases are appropriate for the year right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli &amp; Company. Please go ahead.
Alvaro Lacayo -- Gabelli &amp; Company -- Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen.
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning Alvaro.
Alvaro Lacayo -- Gabelli &amp; Company -- Analyst
Just two quick questions; on North American, the expectations you see for that 0% to 1% growth, if you can maybe just talk to us about your assumptions and what do you think repair and remodel spend growth will be and what your expectations are on new construction?
And then secondly, with regards to the tariffs, particularly the piece that would step up to 25% in March. If that were to change or if that doesn't materialize -- if the step-up doesn't materialize, would that impact pricing realization in any way based on the conversations you have with your retailers on what price increases may be, especially the ones in kitchen that were just announced?
Jim Peters -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think Alvaro, let me start with your second question. As I just mentioned previously, there is a lot of different moving parts within our cost structure today in terms of raw material increases, tariffs, logistics cost increases. And so the 301 tariffs and that last piece is only a small part of all those increases that you see. So I think there's a lot of other moving pieces and cost pressures that we're seeing right now on top of that. And I think, as Marc mentioned, that -- well, it could be a benefit to us, it's not going to be a significant benefit against that total bucket of cost increase that we're seeing right now.
The second thing, and then I'll kind of let Marc talk a little bit about the demand. As we've looked over time in terms of what -- how much of the demand is replacement versus discretionary? It typically treads around the 50% range plus or minus 5% from there. And as we look forward to 2019, we don't see a significant deviation in that in terms of what we expect to be just versus the last three or four years what we expect to be discretionary versus replacement.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. And Alvaro, It's Marc. Let me maybe just add a few additional comments on, particular about housing. And obviously, we all follow the present analyst reports on housing and it almost feels like a -- there was a first a period of overconfidence and now over pessimism, and I think both extremes are wrong I think about fundamental housing, yes we saw some moderation, but fundamentals are solid.
Now to give a little bit more color, and I think I made some comments on this one on previous earnings call. The US housing market ever since recession has been supply constraints. That supply constraint led to probably an acceleration of home prices ahead of where you would expect in the demand cycle, and kind of that started to stifle down demand a little bit. Come on top of that the mortgage increase which were particular in, I think, August-September of last year. That together led to a small moderation.
Now, having said that, if you look at the fundamentals of household formation, entry buyers, age of housing stock, rental occupancy, et cetera, et cetera, the fundamentals actually leave a lot of upside opportunity. So, with that in mind, whenever people talk about the housing market, it's not even remotely comparable to what we saw like a decade ago.
We're still on the new housing way below 25 year average of new housing and even existing home sales are far away from high numbers. To be more specifically, yes on existing home sales, we would expect the number of clearly north of 5%, probably somewhere around 5.3% to 5.6% in that ballpark. And of new housing, we would expect the number getting close to $1.3 million, which again is way below kind of what you've seen in previous cycles and way below long-term average. At the same time, we don't expect kind of a double-digit to high single-digit growth of that market. It will be a solid, probably low single-digit growth in the housing market.
Alvaro Lacayo -- Gabelli &amp; Company -- Analyst
Thank you.
Marc Bitzer -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I think we're coming to the end of the Q&amp;A section. So let me maybe just quickly summarize little bit some of our key messages from this call and also from Q&amp;A on Slide 20. As we exit 2018, we are encouraged by the results of our actions to overcome significant external pressures and volatility.
Now looking back at 2018 we took decisive actions to overcome these headwinds, including the successful execution of our previously announced cost-based price increases, delivering our cost takeout commitments, refocusing and rightsizing our European business, and driving sustainable improvements in working capital.
We are confident that the strategy and actions currently in place will generate margin expansion and strong free cash flow in 2019. Regarding capital allocation, we will continue to buy back shares at a moderate pace, while we are on track to further strengthen our balance sheets.
And finally, we will be providing you with a strategic update on our long-term plans at our Investor Day in New York City on May 23rd. With that, I just want to thank you for joining us today. Wish you all a good week and looking forward to talking with all of you at our earnings call in late April.

Harry McCracken,"When Nest shipped its first smart thermostat in 2011, it wasn’t just a strikingly new take on the mundane matter of controlling a home’s temperature. It also felt like a historic beachhead in the battle to convince consumers to wire up their households with smart devices—which helps explain why Google bought the startup for $3.2 billion a little over a year later. As countless people have pointed out, Nest was slow to capitalize on the opportunity it had created for itself. It introduced a ( problematic ) smoke detector and bought security-cam pioneer Dropcam, and has released numerous updates and variants on its existing products. But its lineup remained small and the benefits of decking out your home with multiple pieces of Nest gear weren’t all that obvious. And then last September, the company had a big bang of a product unveiling, announcing Nest Secure (a security system built around a hub called Nest Guard) and Nest Hello (a doorbell cam), along with an outdoor version of its top-of-the-line Nest IQ cam. It also said it would begin integrating the Google Assistant voice agent into its products. In January, it built out its line a little further with the announcement of the Nest x Yale Lock, a smart front-door lock manufactured by Yale and designed to operate as part of the Nest Secure system. Nest Hello [Photo: courtesy of Nest] Only now, six months later, is the company completing the process of turning those announcements into shipping products. The two stragglers, Nest Hello and the Nest x Yale Lock, are now available, along with new Nest Temperature Sensors which let Nest’s thermostat monitor the climate in remote rooms (such as a child’s bedroom). In addition, the Google Assistant integration promised for the Nest IQ indoor cam back in September has arrived. The new stuff rounds out the Nest portfolio in some highly competitive categories. (Amazon recently paid a reported $1.1 billion for Ring, the best-known maker of smart doorbells.) More important, it starts to make clear why you might be happier purchasing all sorts of smart-home gizmos from Nest rather than mixing and matching items from multiple companies. “We’ve had the same design team working on all of them, and they really feel like a family,” says Nest director of product marketing Maxime Veron, who demoed the products for me recently. “Arguably, Nest is the only company out there that unlocks so many use cases in your home.” Nest x Yale Lock [Photo: courtesy of Nest] The fact that Nest products look like a matched set is nice. Ultimately, though, what matters most is that they’re aware of each other’s existence and coordinate their behavior in ways that make sense. In a fully Nest-equipped home, for example, unlocking the Nest x Yale lock using its keypad will disarm the Nest Secure security system, adjust the thermostat, and shut off Nest Cams to preserve your privacy. Though it’s possible to orchestrate similar feats with products from multiple companies using methods such as IFTTT recipes, “we’re not building for the IFTTT people,” stresses Veron. “Very clearly, we’re building for the average user.” The fact that Nest decided to work with lock kingpin Yale rather than design, manufacture, and market a smart lock on its own shows that the company sees boundaries to its skill set but doesn’t want them to stand in the way of the experience it can deliver to consumers. “We debated this for a while when Tony [Fadell] was still our CEO,” Veron says. “Our core comptency is not in building locks, in building highly mechanical products. Yale invented the deadbolt over 100 years ago and they know everything there is to know abour deadbolts.” (For the umpteen categories that aren’t as core to Nest’s vision as a door lock, there’s the Works with Nest program, which lets everything from Philips light bulbs to Whirlpool refrigerators talk to Nest’s own products.) Speaking of core competencies, Nest didn’t have to build its own voice-assistant system for its growing line of products. Instead, it piggybacks on the Google Assistant, a service which leverages all of Google’s vast investments in voice technology, AI, and search. That makes any device that supports the Assistant into a control point for Nest’s platform. And now that Nest is adding the Assistant to its own products, it turns Nest hardware into an entry point into the greater Google ecosystem. Google Assistant support doesn’t turn the Nest IQ camera into a full-blown replacement for a Google Home: In fact, it can’t stream music or podcasts or do anything else that requires sustained audio playback. But if you’ve got one or more Google Homes elsewhere in the house, you can control them from the Nest IQ—for instance, to start music playing on a Google Home Max. That’s not a huge whoop, but it does hint at the increasingly symbiotic relationship that Nest’s hardware and Google’s voice service may develop as Google preps itself for an era in which people spend a lot of time talking to their possessions. The groundwork for turning the Nest Cam IQ into a Google Assistant device was laid before the recent reorg which ended Nest’s time as one of Alphabet’s “ other bets,” a group of ambitious-but-immature businesses which basically includes everything except for Google and YouTube. Now Nest is embedded in the same hardware group responsible for products such as Google Home and Pixel phones. That shift might be a demotion of sorts, but it also opens up the possibility of the company being even more strategically essential to Alphabet and Google’s future than if it had remained a stand-alone entity. “We are closer than ever with every Google team,” Veron says. “We’re part of Google. We’re not a bet anymore.”","It took longer than most would have expected, but the company that’s synonymous with smart thermostats is poised to capitalize on a vision it helped create.

newsfeedback@fool.com (Jeremy Bowman),"What happened Shares of Whirlpool Corporation ( NYSE:WHR ) headed down the drain last month, after the appliance giant reported a disappointing third-quarter earnings report and said it would stop supplying Sears Holdings ( NASDAQ:SHLD ), ending a partnership that had lasted a century. According to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, Whirlpool stock finished the month down 11%. Image source: Whirlpool. As the chart below shows, the stock plunged on Oct. 24 as the company reported earnings and news broke about the divorce from Sears: WHR data by YCharts. So what In its earnings report, Whirlpool said currency-neutral revenue edged up 2% to $5.42 billion, missing estimates at $5.48 billion, as EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) was a weak spot with currency-neutral revenues down 8%. Earnings per share, meanwhile, increased from $3.66 to $3.83, which was also short of expectations of $3.94. CEO Marc Bitzer said that raw material inflation had eaten into operating margins, and the company was launching initiatives such as cost-based price increases and fixed-cost reductions. Separately, Bitzer talked about Whirlpool, which also owns brands like Maytag and KitchenAid, no longer supplying Sears, which was for years the country's biggest appliance seller, due to a pricing dispute. The retailer could have been affected by Whirlpool's cost-based price increases. Bitzer said Sears made up just 3% of Whirlpool's revenue, so the parting wouldn't have a big impact. Now what Management lowered its free cash flow guidance for the year from $1 billion to $900 million, and called for earnings per share of $13.60 to $13.90, down from a range of $14.50 to $15.00. However, CFO Jim Peters said, ""We reaffirm our 2020 goals and are confident that our existing and newly announced actions will put us firmly back on track to deliver our commitments.""

Hilary Brueck,"Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler
 AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite 
 President Donald Trump wants Andrew Wheeler to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the arm of the federal government tasked with protecting human health and the environment across the US. 
 Wheeler has been acting administrator of the EPA since Scott Pruitt resigned from his post as the agency's head in July 2018, following months of ethical and financial scandals. Now President Trump wants to make Wheeler's position official. 
 On Wednesday, 19 days into a government shutdown, the White House sent Wheeler's nomination for the position, along with five other nominee names, to the Senate for review. 
 ""I am honored and grateful that President Trump has nominated me to lead the Environmental Protection Agency,"" Wheeler said in a statement on Wednesday. 
 ""For me, there is no greater responsibility than protecting human health and the environment, and I look forward to carrying out this essential task on behalf of the American public."" 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler speaks to EPA staff, Wednesday, July 11, 2018, at EPA Headquarters in Washington.
 AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin 
Since he started as acting administrator, Wheeler's EPA has proposed allowing more mercury to be emitted into US air, and sought to undo decades-old protections for wetlands and streams that help maintain the quality of our water supply. 
 ""He was very much an early Trump supporter,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One when he appointed Wheeler temporarily in July. ""He was with us on the campaign. He is a very environmental person. He's a big believer, and he's going to do a fantastic job."" 
 Others aren't convinced. 
 ""In almost seven months as acting administrator, he has led efforts to weaken or eliminate meaningful limits on the largest sources of climate pollution, including smokestacks, tailpipes, and oil and gas facilities,"" Environmental Defense Fund president Fred Krupp said of Wheeler in a statement. ""His policies will lead to dirtier air and water and unchecked climate pollution."" 
 Before Wheeler took over, Pruitt had also sought to delay and roll back environmental regulations. When he resigned, Trump tweeted that the former administrator had done an ""outstanding"" job. 
 But Pruitt's long list of scandals included reportedly sending his staffers out in search of pricey beauty creams, spending high sums on first-class flights, instituting a 24-hour security detail, and purchasing an infamously expensive $43,000 phone booth, all on the public's dime.

Before becoming the EPA's deputy administrator, Wheeler worked for law firm Faegre Baker Daniels as an attorney, consultant, and co-chair of the firm's Energy and Natural Resources Industry team, according to Wheeler's EPA biography. 
 A Washington University law school graduate, Wheeler spent the first four years of his career at the EPA under presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. At that time, he was a special assistant in the Pollution Prevention and Toxics office, working on issues involving pollution and chemicals. 
 Since then, Wheeler has split his time between lobbying Capitol Hill and working inside the halls of the federal government. On the lobbying side, he has worked for big names in the beltway energy sector, including Murray Energy (coal), Domestic Energy Solutions Group, Whirlpool Corporation, Xcel Energy and at least a dozen others, which ProPublica lists online. 
Andrew Wheeler
 EPA via AP 
On the governement side, Wheeler has worked as chief of staff for Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) and on staff for Senator George Voinovich (R-OH). 
 He held several roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works from 2003 to 2009: majority staff director, minority staff director, and chief counsel. 
 According to a biography on ProPublica's website, Wheeler worked on ""every major piece of environmental and energy-related legislation before Congress for over a decade."" 
 For example, he worked for the Committee on Environment and Public Works when the Clear Skies Act of 2003 was proposed, which aimed to reduce restrictions on toxins in the air. He was also there for the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which raised taxes on oil and gas producers in the US. 
 Wheeler doesn't deny the scientific facts of climate change, but he said during his confirmation hearing for the deputy administrator position at the EPA that the human impact on the Earth's rising temperature is ""not completely understood,"" as Inside Climate News reported. 
 Scott Segal, a fossil fuel lobbyist who has worked with Wheeler, told The New York Times: ""He's a careful, studious person. A quiet fellow. He knows the agency very, very well."" 
 Many environmentalists are fearful about what that savvy perspective might mean for the future of the EPA. The agency is tasked with protecting the nation's air and water, but the Trump administration has pushed to undo a host of environmental regulations. 
 Jeremy Symons, vice president for political affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, put it bluntly to Politico: 
 ""Wheeler is much smarter and will try to keep his efforts under the radar in implementing Trump's destructive agenda,"" Symons said, comparing Wheeler to Pruitt.""That should scare anyone who breathes.""

Andrew Tangel,"Federal trade regulators have recommended that the Trump administration impose big tariffs on imported washing machines to protect Whirlpool Corp. and other U.S. manufacturers. Members of the U.S. International Trade Commission, a bipartisan agency that oversees trade, on Tuesday released three sets of recommendations that include tariffs of 50% on imported washers exceeding a quota of 1.2 million units annually. Their recommendations follow their finding in October that Whirlpool and other domestic washer makers suffered “serious injury” from a surge of imports. The trade commission’s recommendations are expected to head to the White House in early December. The Trump administration would then have about two months to weigh the recommendations and decide what, if any, new trade barriers to put in place. The recommendations aren’t binding. The office of U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer referred questions to the White House. A White House spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A Whirlpool spokesman noted that the recommendations were a preliminary step before President Donald Trump makes a decision on the matter.

Megan Wollerton,"Whirlpool's $999 WTW7500GC top-load washing machine has a faucet built into its washer drum like GE's $799 GTW750CSLWS for convenient hand washing and stain treating. It also has the easiest-to-read display panel I've ever seen -- everything is so neatly organized that I hope other brands take note. Sadly, the WTW7500GC wasn't as good at removing stuff like red wine and cocoa as other washers we've tested. It's a shame, because I like a lot of things about the Whirlpool WTW7500GC, but this isn't the washing machine for folks who consider performance a prime concern (and that will be most of you). If you care more about design and usability, this could be the right model.

Dan Schawbel,"Andrea Comi/Getty Images Employees around the world yearn for freedom and flexibility. The most common form of flexibility that companies offer is the ability to work remote. In a new study by my firm and Virgin Pulse, we found that a third of employees globally work remote always or very often. Compared to a decade ago, the number of remote workers has increased by 115%. I’ve personally worked from home for almost eight years and have benefitted from the independence, autonomy, and five-second commute time. Despite these benefits, I often feel lonely, isolated, and less engaged with my team, since I rarely see them face-to-face and am confined to a 500-square-foot apartment. After interviewing over 2,000 employees and managers globally, our study discovered two-thirds of remote workers aren’t engaged and over a third never get any face-time with their team—yet over 40% said it would help build deeper relationships. The study also found that remote workers are much less likely to stay at their company long-term. Only 5% always or very often see themselves working at their company for their entire career, compared to almost a third that never work remotely. When you don’t see or hear your colleagues over a long period of time, you can become less committed to your team and organization — and start looking for your next opportunity — since no one is looking over your shoulder while you job search. While the population of remote workers is growing, some companies are simultaneously rolling back their remote work programs and forcing their employees to be at the office everyday with no exceptions. Companies that have already mandated this include Yahoo!, Best Buy, HP, Reddit, IBM, and Honeywell. They agree that in-person collaboration fosters teamwork, idea-sharing and quicker decision making. They believe that it’s the best way to build a strong culture, increase engagement, and fuel work relationships. Kiah Erlich, Director, a senior director at Honeywell told me: “When our company eliminated working from home several months ago, it was disappointing and not fun as a manager to explain to some of my permanently remote employees. But as a leader who craves human interaction, it has been one of the greatest things we’ve done. People are actually in the office now. What once was a painful conference call is now a collaborative white-boarding session. Instead of more emails, people get out of their chair and walk over to my office. It is a beautiful thing to see, and it has not only improved productivity but brought the team closer together.” Leaders want their employees to have a similar experience has because it’s good for the culture and business. Instead of saving money by promoting remote work, many companies are investing money in their office designs. A well-designed office, with an assortment of meeting spaces, gives employees the flexibility they desire but in a collaborative environment. Apple is spending about $5 billion for a 2.8 million square-foot office space that accommodates about 12,000 employees. Amazon will also spend $5 billion on their new headquarters to employ 50,000 people, and Zurich North America spent $333 million for a 783,000 square foot office for 3,000 employees. Clearly, design matters to these companies; they want a place where employees can freely interact to create breakthrough ideas. These companies understand that employees’ proximity to each other matters. The closer we sit to our colleagues, the more likely we will interact with them and form the relationships that lead to long-term team commitment. Back in 1977, MIT Professor Thomas J. Allen studied the communication patterns among both scientists and engineers and found that the further apart their desks were, the less likely they were to communicate. If they were 30 meters or further from each other, the likelihood of regular communication was zero. Mike Maxwell, a senior category leader at Whirlpool, says: “Face-to-face meetings give you the proximity and presence that make collaboration more effective. I am also better able to read the room and pick up on the unsaid words. Reading the room is critical for knowing when things need further explaining or when to drop something that isn’t going over well.” Aside from lacking proximity, there are often times a lag in communications with a remote workforce. Getting everyone on the same page, on the same call and in the same mindset is challenging when people aren’t located in the same place. “Whenever there’s a gap in communication across a remote and dispersed workforce, people fill that void with their own assumptions,” says Dr. Rajiv Kumar, president and chief medical officer at Virgin Pulse— assumptions that can result in work conflicts. Although research shows that remote workers are more productive, and they’ll tell you that they enjoy the flexibility, they typically won’t reveal how isolated they are. Some companies have gone to extremes to either force everyone into the office or enable all employees to work remote, but very often, meeting in the middle is best. Give them the flexibility at the office, while an option to work remote part-time based on their position and needs. They need face-time even if they won’t admit it, and companies need an engaged workforce in order to retain talent and compete in the global economy.",Fewer face-to-face interactions leads to less commitment.,2018-11-15T14:00:23Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hbr.org'}",Survey: Remote Workers Are More Disengaged and More Likely to Quit,https://hbr.org/2018/11/survey-remote-workers-are-more-disengaged-and-more-likely-to-quit,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/11/nov18_15_837601792.jpg,,Hbr.org,whirlpool,1
"Stan Horaczek, Stan Horaczek","Pretty much everyone is making really big TVs with lots of pixels
Big TVs have been a CES staple since the days of those big, fat ones of the past and this year is no exception. Samsung announced that its QLED TVs will now come in sizes up up to 98 inches, while LG announced a massive 88-inch TV with an audio system built right into the screen, and Sonys flagship OLED Z9G line now comes in a 98-inch model as well. Vizio showed off an 85-inch 8K TV it may or may not sell this year, and even TCLa company best known for its budget-friendly, Netflix-equipped TVs in the U.S.has a 75-inch screen on display.
All of this is going to be really great when theres actually 8K content to watch.
Samsungs has new robots and exoskeletons to help turn you into a gadget
There was a one more thing at the end of Samsungs CES press event. The company announced a new robotics platform with a variety of products to help users (and also sell them stuff). The most intriguing is the Bot Care, which is an adorable little android thats meant to cohabit with elderly people and remind them to do stuff like check their blood pressure or take their medication. The robot also realizes when theres a health emergency and can alert emergency contacts, or even 911.
Bot Air detects when air quality is subpar and helps filter out pollutants, while the Bot Retail can sell you things and also deliver waffles.
The GENS exoskeletons support specific parts of a wearers legs, including the hips, knees, or ankles. They can do some of the work required in walking around to reduce pain, but they can also increase resistance for athletes that want robotic help with their training.
Whirlpool put AI and AR into ovens to help you stop burning your meatloaf
W Labs is an incubator within Whirlpool thats tasked with developing futuristic appliances. At CES 2019, the lab showed off two different new ovens meant to assist hungry users who want a hand with the cooking. The more extravagant of the two is just a concept called the Connected Hub Wall Oven, which has a 27-inch translucent screen that can display things like step-by-step cooking instructions and even let you take a closer look at your food as it cooks so you can see if your soufflés has turned into a catastrophe.
The Smart Countertop Oven is a real, but limited edition, product that works a lot like the June smart oven in that it uses built-in AI to analyze what youre cooking and help you select the right settings like temperature and cook time. The company is only making 2,000 of the smart ovens, but they all have voice command options from Google Assistant and Alexa. So, were one step closer to hucking a frozen turkey into the oven from across the room and shouting, Alexa, make dinner! and having it actually work out.
Otterbox made a PopSocket case
Regardless of what other internet hot takes say about PopSockets, those little plastic circles make smartphones a lot easier to hold. Unfortunately, however, they also prevent your phone from laying flat when you put it down on its back. The new Otterbox + Pop cases integrate the PopSocket directly into the iPhone case. The case costs $59, but offers burly phone protection in addition to playing nice with those PopSockets.
HTC made a new VR headset with eye-tracking
Virtual reality is still chugging along here at CES 2019, and HTC has had some of the biggest VR news so far. The company showed off a new version if its high-end Vive headset with eye-tracking technology that lets you look around with more accuracy in virtual worlds. It also lets you perform some tasks like navigating menus simply by focusing your line of sight in different areas.
In addition to its high-end offering, HTC also announced the lower-end Vive Cosmos, which is meant to be a more consumer-friendly model scheduled for later in 2019.
Holoride is making VR games to entertain you while you ride in an Audi
Cutting down on screen time is a big theme in tech right now, unless youre riding in a car. Samsung, for instance, just announced a new in-car technology suite that has a bigger-than-an-iPad screen for each person to browse content during a ride. A company called Holoride has taken the concept one step further by creating a full-on VR experience meant to entertain riders in Audi cars.
The game is called Marvels Avengers: Rockets Rescue Run and it uses motion cues from the car as well as GPS information about the route to create a custom content experience. That syncing helps cut down on motion sickness and tailor the entertainment to the exact length of the trip. Eventually it will work outside of the Audi stable if Holoride follows through on its plans, which sounds a lot more fun than playing I Spy like when we were kids.",Gadgets Get the CES experience without the walking or dehydration.

ANA SWANSON,"“We will make our best effort along with the industry to ensure that the final decision minimizes damage to Korean companies by reaching out to the U.S. administration, Congress, local governments and other officials to proactively explain our position,” said Kang Sung-cheon, the country’s deputy minister of trade. While Mr. Trump has tried to persuade South Korean leaders to help him limit the nuclear influence of North Korea, he has also criticized South Korea for amassing a trade deficit with the United States and opened a renegotiation of a trade pact between the countries. Mr. Trump often talked about bolstering domestic manufacturing by imposing limits, including tariffs, on foreign products. But the prospect of these tariffs has sparked a fierce backlash from companies and consumers, who say they would raise prices and limit consumer choice in the United States. This is the second recent trade action brought under an obscure section of trade law known as Section 201, or the “global safeguard,” which gives the president broad authority to impose tariffs or other restrictions to help protect a domestic industry. On Oct. 31, the trade commission announced that it was forwarding a similar decision on the solar power market to the president. Mr. Trump will have to decide whether to impose penalties on foreign solar products by January. Before the solar case, the law had not been used to initiate a trade action since 2001. As in the solar complaint, a domestic manufacturer asked the government to consider a safeguard case after its rivals dodged previous trade actions targeted at one country by moving their operations elsewhere. Whirlpool accused Samsung and LG of “serial country-hopping” to evade American trade actions. Samsung and LG imported about three million washers in 2016, Whirlpool said. In a statement, Whirlpool said that it was “encouraged” by the decision and that it “remains optimistic that the administration will implement a full and appropriate remedy to ensure that Samsung and LG cannot circumvent any element of the order.” “The proposed tariff is consistent with what the companies would be paying had they not evaded antidumping orders by moving production from China to Thailand and Vietnam,” Whirlpool said. Samsung was more muted in its statement, saying that it continued “to believe that no remedy is necessary.” LG said in a statement that trade restrictions “will only hurt consumers by raising prices and decreasing choices, while jeopardizing U.S. investment, innovation and job growth.” Both South Korean companies cited their plans to make washing machines in the United States. Several members of Congress, including Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, and Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., a Democrat from New Jersey, wrote the commissioners on Friday to caution that imposing tariffs could have unintended consequences, including by raising prices and potentially costing jobs at Samsung and LG facilities in the United States.

Anand Srinivasan,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. It's a common refrain: Corporations are bulky and bureaucratic while startups are agile. The conventional wisdom has been reality, for the most part. It explains how startups like Tesla grew up to disrupt industries dominated by a few, leading firms. Enterprise businesses simply don't have the flexibility to pivot like startups do. The landscape seems to be changing -- albeit slowly, in typical enterprise fashion. Kimberly-Clark, for example, routinely organizes “expert acceleration sessions” in which thought leaders chellenge business teams to think like startups. Similarly, Whirlpool hosts i-mentors who work with business teams to cultivate an innovation mindset and challenge market “orthodoxies.” The objective here is obvious: to prevent large and successful organizations from having their own Kodak moments. Too big to pivot? The opportunity cost often proves too high for corporate leaders. Why pursue the dream of a startup when the organization already rakes in millions with a successful, well-established product? Massive organizations are slowed by a bureaucracy of their own making. They typically spend millions of dollars to pursue a business goal. Changing course, then, is a million-dollar decision in another direction. Leaders can't make those moves on a whim. Innovation requires large corporations to integrate new products with legacy systems and processes, including the tightly connected technology to support it all. Pivoting costs money and time. And in an enterprise group, it demands exponentially higher investments, compared to startup innovations. Related: Commitment to Innovation Is How Legacy Companies Stay Agile A new approach. Recently, though, a number of enterprises have started to adopt ""zero code"" or ""codeless"" integration strategies. This shifts the innovation focus within organizations, moving it from back-end or technology teams to more front-of-house operations and business teams. Research leader Gartner has coined a term for this trend: citizen integration. In this model, citizen integrators leverage self-service systems to innovate -- without having to rely on technology teams to do the job for them. How could it look in the real world? Uber and its millions of customers provide a solid example. A marketing manager at Uber might be interested to know if the company can increase ride rates by sending a coupon just before a customer is ready to travel. Marketers typically take such ideas to developers, who then build the necessary infrastructure to execute a campaign. Codeless integration interrupts the cycle, shortening it. The Uber marketer instead could consult a customer list and prepare a subset roster of all riders who have called a cab between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. over the past few days. Then, the marketer could launch a trial campaign by using Uber's push notifications to share a coupon. Self-service data sets and technology reduce the turnaround from several days to a matter of minutes. Related: What Self-Service Business Intelligence Is and How to Use It Saving millions. Codeless integration does the same for costs. It effectively allows an enterprise to overcome the limitations of its mammoth size and embrace disruption to stay ahead of the curve. Business operations don't have to wait for IT. That frees up technology teams to concentrate on highly productive, strategic tasks. Error-handling and exceptions can be automated to further prioritize IT time and resources. When all of this comes together, customers and partners enjoy a superior service-delivery experience. This ultimately affects the enterprise's bottom line and helps save millions. Startups Zapier and IFTTT are popular codeless integration services among consumer-end businesses. Adeptia and others offer similar tools at a larger scale for enterprise businesses. Some large corporations take the best from all worlds, using self-service integration tools to connect internal systems with third-party services such as SAP and Salesforce. Related: Stop Looking at Your IT Department as a Cost Center High stakes, higher costs. Most large organizations still prefer the traditional IT route for high-stakes projects and innovations -- for good reason. These projects enjoy generous budgets to allocate resources and marketing. Leaders may deem it unnecessary to divert funds toward a bootstrapped alternative like codeless integration. This is, however, a myopic way to look at business strategies. Startups have begun disrupting every sphere of the economy. It won't be long before large, enterprise players realize money and resources can take them only so far. Agility and execution are paramount in this race. Any strategy that helps businesses cut time and costs could make the difference.","Big corporations are starting to think like disruptors, adopting 'codeless integration' processes.",2018-11-27T15:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",How Large Enterprises Are Becoming More Agile and Saving Millions,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/323148,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20181126195142-GettyImages-736491081.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,whirlpool,1

Whirlpool Corp ( NYSE:WHR ) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call Oct. 24, 2018, 8:00 a.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good morning and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff. Max Tunnicliff -- Senior Director of Investor Relations Thank you and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chief Executive Officer and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpool.com. Before we begin, I remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions. With that, let me turn the call over to Marc. Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks and good morning everyone. On slide 3, we show our third quarter highlights. As you saw in our press release, we delivered record ongoing earnings per share of $4.55 as well as ongoing EBIT margin expansion in 3 of 4 regions. For the second quarter in a row, we delivered very strong price and mix in all regions as we continue to realize the benefits of the price mix actions we took earlier this year. Additionally, our North America region delivered impressive results driving strong top and bottom line growth. We expanded ongoing EBIT margins in North American regions despite soft US industry demand and continued cost pressures as we increased our share positions while also delivering very strong price and mix. Operational and external challenges continue to weigh on our European results. While we are encouraged by the sequential progress we made on slowly restoring volume in the third quarter, and today we are announcing further actions to refocus and improve our Europe performance in 2019 which Jim will discuss later in the call. Additionally, as part of our ongoing initiatives to respond to external factors, including raw material, tariff and currency headwinds, we have recently announced new cost base price increases, including our US kitchen and Brazilian major home appliance business. Finally, we have taken multiple actions related to recent changes in US tax legislation which favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the quarter, most notable of voluntary prepayment of a portion of our long-term pension obligation. Turning to slide 4, I will discuss our third quarter results. Excluding currency, we delivered global growth of approximately 1.5% driven by unit volume growth in North America and Latin America and strong global price and mix. Ongoing EBIT margin was 6.2% as price mix was more than offset by continued cost inflation and increased marketplace investments related to recent product launches. As mentioned earlier, we made a voluntary contribution of approximately $350 million to lower our long-term pension obligation funding, which impacted our free cash flow year-to-date. We will discuss our guidance in more detail later on the call. Our ability to successfully execute cost base price increases and drive improved mix across multiple regions while maintaining strong cost discipline, furthers our confidence that we are well positioned to deliver margin expansion and improved free cash flow conversion over the upcoming quarters. Turning to slide 5, we show the drivers of our third quarter margin performance. As mentioned earlier, our global price mix improved sequentially, as well as the year-over-year and was positive in all 4 regions. Our previously announced fixed cost reduction actions continue to progress in line of expectations, and during the quarter these benefits were offset by three main drivers. First, with the net cost, we experienced rising freight costs as well as volume deleverage primarily related to our inventory reduction actions. Second, raw material inflation continue to be a significant year-over-year headwind impacting third quarter margin by approximately 175 basis points while unfavorable currency impacted margin by 50 basis points. Finally, our margin was impacted by additional investments related to product launches, primarily North America which Jim will discuss in more detail later in the presentation. Turning to slide 6, we once again demonstrate our commitment to delivering significant price mix performance. In total, third quarter price mix improved by approximately 250 basis points compared to the prior year and we delivered positive price mix in all regions. On a sequential basis, every year, every region have a maintained or improved price mix, driving quarter-over-quarter improvement of 50 basis points globally. These results demonstrates the success of the initiatives we've implemented over the past several quarters. Finally, we recently announced additional cost base price increase in multiple regions, including our US kitchen and Brazil businesses which will become effective during the fourth quarter. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jim to review our regional results. James Peters -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks Marc, and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 8, we review the third quarter results for our North America region. We delivered very impressive results in the quarter with both revenue growth and ongoing margin expansion in spite of a challenging external environment. Net sales increased 5% despite an industry demand decline of nearly 2% in the quarter. We delivered this growth through strong price mix as well as volume growth due to market share gains primarily in the kitchen category. Overall, we expanded our ongoing EBIT margin 20 basis points to 12% as our strong performance overcame more than 200 basis points of raw material tariff and freight cost inflation. These strong results once again demonstrate the success of our proactive price mix and cost initiatives and show the fundamental strength of our business in North America. Looking forward, we expect to deliver continued strong results in the region as our previously announced price mix actions and recently announced US kitchen cost base price increases are expected to offset continued cost pressures next year. In addition to these actions, we expect to deliver continued growth and margin expansion as we improved volume and mix through a steady offering of innovative products including those shown on slide 9. In the third quarter, we completed the launch of a number of connected kitchen products under the Whirlpool brand. These products combine modern design and compelling features including Yummly Guided Cooking and voice command capabilities. Also, within our North America business, we have made two massive laundry platform investments totaling approximately $100 million. In the fourth quarter, we are launching our brand new front-load laundry line including a connected all-in-one washer and dryer. These products feature industry leading innovations. The second major laundry investment brings significant upgrades to our top load platform and launches later in 2019. This new connected washer and dryer pair will offer brand specific and consumer relevant innovation in both the mass and mass premium segments. While we continue to focus on cost containment and managing price mix across our portfolio, we are truly excited about the growth and margin expansion opportunities that these and other new products will enable for our business. Turning to slide 10, we review the third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales were down 8%. Volume remains a challenge, but we are beginning to see sequential progress with improvement in most countries. EBIT declined versus the prior year as the positive price mix was more than offset by unit volume declines and unfavorable productivity due to reducing inventories. Additionally, the combination of raw materials, inflation, unfavorable currency and operational challenges in Turkey impacted results by approximately $40 million or more than 350 basis points. Turning to slide 11, I'd like to update you on the strategic actions we are taking to refocus the EMEA business and return to profitability. First, we have taken specific actions to recover and restore volume across the core EMEA business. We saw some improvement in the third quarter and expect further improvement in the fourth quarter, but the pace and magnitude have been slow. In order to drive a fundamental change in our volume, year-over-year, we are focused on rebuilding relationships with our trade customers and recovering floor spots lost during the peak of the integration. We are also committed to refocusing our marketplace investments toward our most profitable segments to ensure that we not only drive higher volumes, but also capitalize on new product innovation to expand margins. Second, as we announced last quarter, we have begun to reevaluate certain aspects of our EMEA business. As part of that effort, we are announcing several new strategic actions to refocus and right size our business. We will be exiting a number of loss-making businesses including our Turkish domestic sales operation which does not include the factory operations as well as our Hotpoint branded small appliance business. Additionally, we are evaluating our South Africa operations for a potential sale as we refocus on our core European business. Together, these three businesses represent approximately $230 million in revenue and a sizable EBIT loss of $60 million for the full year 2018. Finally, we have announced a new $50 million fixed cost reduction initiative for the region, which is expected to deliver benefits in 2019. This initiative is an addition to the $150 million global fixed cost reduction announced last year. As a result of all of these actions, we expect to drive approximately $100 million in annualized EBIT improvement in EMEA, before exit cost as actions are completed throughout 2019. This represents a step function improvement to our regional cost structure and is the first step to restoring profitability and getting back on track toward our long-term margin targets for the region. With that, we turn to slide 12 to review the third quarter results for our Latin America region. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased approximately 2%. Ongoing EBIT increased a 11%, a strong price mix and volume growth, more than offset $15 million of raw material and currency headwinds, driving margin expansion. We delivered these strong results through unit volume growth, share gains and positive price mix. We are well positioned to deliver margin expansion in Latin America in the coming quarters through strong cost discipline and realizing the benefits of recently announced cost base price increases in the region. We now turn to the third quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on slide 13. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales declined 4%. We delivered EBIT of $13 million, a solid improvement versus the prior year. Our third quarter results were positively impacted by EBIT improvement in China and positive price mix. We delivered strong results despite raw material inflation of approximately $10 million and productivity headwinds related to lower volume levels and temporary industry demand weakness. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance. Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Jim. On slide 15, we review our updated guidance assumptions. We continue to expect total revenue to be flat to the prior year, a strong price mix improvement is offset by lower unit volumes. Despite the success of our global price mix and cost reduction initiatives, as well as the continued strength of our business in North America, we're slightly revising our ongoing EBIT margin expectations as a result of weaker than anticipated results in Europe for the second half. We now expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $600 million primarily driven by our voluntary pension contribution. Absent of our voluntary one-time items, we expect to deliver approximately $800 million in underlying free cash flow this year. Finally, we expect an ongoing 2018 effective tax rate of approximately 10.5% for the full year, driven by our voluntary pension pre-funding and additional tax planning actions. As a result of these adjustments, we are narrowing our ongoing earnings per share guidance toward the high end of our previous range. We now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $14.50 to $14.80 per share, which will be an all-time record. Turning to slide 16, we show the updated drivers of our ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We continue to expect to deliver approximately $400 million or 2 points of net benefit from improved price mix as our global cost base price increases have delivered strong results in line with expectation. Our previously announced fixed cost reduction actions remain on track to deliver $150 million benefit this year. However, we have reduced our expectation for net cost, as volume weakness has impacted conversion, and fuel price inflation has continued to impact our freight costs. Finally, our guidance for raw material inflation, currency and marketing investments are unchanged. Overall, we now expect to deliver 6.4% ongoing EBIT margin this year. Now Jim will cover our regional guidance and cash priorities. James Peters -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Marc. On slide 17, we show our regional industry and EBIT margin guidance. We now expect the US industry to continue to build on the growth we saw in September and deliver modest growth of approximately 1% for the full year. And we continue to expect to deliver approximately 12% ongoing EBIT margin in North America for the full year. In EMEA, we now expect to deliver EBIT margin of approximately negative 2% to 3%. Finally, our guidance for Latin America and Asia is unchanged. Turning to slide 18, our total free cash flow guidance for 2018 remains essentially the same as our previous guidance. We have reduced our guidance for cash earnings as a result of our performance in EMEA. Capital expenditures have been slightly reduced due to changes in the timing of certain projects, excluding the impact of discrete voluntary items, our full year 2018, free cash flow expectation is approximately $800 million. Our updated free cash guidance reflects approximately $350 million of pension pre-funding, we discussed earlier, as well as, the benefits of the real estate portfolio optimization opportunity expected in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 19, we show our capital allocation priorities for 2018, which are unchanged and on track. We continue to expect to close the sale of our Embraco compressor business in early 2019. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $100 million of common stock and we expect to continue repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $1.3 billion in cash to shareholders, which already represents an all-time record on an annual basis. Now, I'll turn it back over to Marc. Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Jim. Turning to slide 20, I would like to take a moment to provide a few assumptions regarding our current expectations for 2019. We expect modest global industry growth in the low single digits with the US industry showing growth of approximately 1%. Our positive view on the US appliance industry is based in part in our perspective regarding the US housing market. While we recognize the sluggish trends in housing starts and existing home sales, there are some more favorable fundamentals related to housing supply and demand, but are getting less attention. First, housing recovery has been held back by massive supply constraints. Since the end of the recession, housing starts have remained well below the 25-year average of 1.3 million units per year. Further, the current age of the US rental stock is now 40 years and a 100% of the new apartments applied since the recession has been fully observed. Secondly, supply constraints have led to a strong appreciation of home prices in essence, the home prices placed well ahead of where you would expect them to be in the cycle (ph). This, coupled with mortgage constraints and rising interest rates has tempered demand. And thirdly, we are now seeing a scenario where slowdown of home price appreciation and a slight increase in inventory will meet strong demand fundamentals including favorable demographics, a home ownership rate at a 52-year low and a strong need for rental homes and apartments. We expect the combination of these factors to lead to continued recovery in the housing market will perhaps at a slower pace, which in turn would help ensure continued healthy demand for new appliances. While we believe the US industry will continue to grow in the coming years as a result of these factors, we also want to be clear that our North American business is well positioned to deliver strong results in any environment, as evidenced by our performance of this year. Shifting to cost for 2019, we currently expect raw material and tariff inflation of approximately $300 million similar to what we are facing in 2018. We do expect our previous and recently announced cost base price increases to fully offset this cost inflation while continued cost discipline and focus on cost takeout will enable us to expand margins in the coming year. Finally, we anticipate a significantly reduced restructuring expenses, and an ongoing effective tax rate in 2019 of less than 20%. At this point, I also want to remind you that we will provide our guidance for 2019 on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Now, we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions. Questions and Answers: Operator (Operator Instructions). We'll take the questions from Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital. Kenneth Zener -- KeyBanc Capital -- Analyst Good morning. Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Ken. Kenneth Zener -- KeyBanc Capital -- Analyst So it's been quite a year, very steady US results as you're gaining price amid lots of international volatility. So just because Europe was such a big adjustment, I would say this year, and I think it's important what you're doing in your small business appliance, say you're walking away from $230 million of revenue, which is a $65 million less, just for perspective, was that business/businesses, were those making money in let's say FY '16 and FY '17 and I ask, because I'm trying to understand if you can shrink your way to profitability given your -- I believe FY '20 margin targets, which are still below your long-term targets of 7% to 8%. I'm just trying to understand how you might be able to get there sooner on the margin basis? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer So Ken, it's Marc. So let me actually maybe split the answer in two pieces. First, because you started with US, obviously we are very pleased with our US results in Q3. We had revenue growth, we had share growth, pricing contracts and we overcame a lot of headwinds and delivered 12% margin, which I think is a very, very strong result given the overall environment. So we're really pleased about US performance. Specifically on European, the actions which we announced basically fall into a bucket of what we call non-core business. It's the Hotpoint FT business, the Turkey domestic sales, it's not for production, it is for domestic sales and we're looking at options for South Africa. As you saw in the presentation that's roughly around that $230 million revenue and $60 million loss this year. Now, specific to your question, if I would look back at full-year '16, these are businesses which even over longer term did not create a lot of value for us or no value at all. Specifically, Turkey even Turkey health environment is a tough business. Because you have some local competitors and there is a strong franchise network and stores, which is always difficult to get into. So I would say even in normal environment, it's a tough market and basically this was under the headline, we want to stop certain leaders, where we also didn't see a long-term perspective to create value. Now also linked to your point about shrinking your way to profitability, now what we are doing with these actions is, we want to eliminate some leaders. We want to give the team a chance to focus on the core businesses. We are making money and we can make a lot of money in our core markets where we are strong, so this is very much about the focus. The ultimate way to profitability beyond restoring volumes, which is more in the short term, ultimately comes back to what I referred to in my previous conference call. We have to strengthen our so-called build-in business which is the kitchen business, and that's our path to profitability and beyond the short-term actions of restoring volumes. Kenneth Zener -- KeyBanc Capital -- Analyst Thank you. Was that two or one, can I ask another one Marc? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Kenneth Zener -- KeyBanc Capital -- Analyst Well, in the US, looking at the volume and price, I just thought looking at 2012 when you guys got about 5% price, which is where you're kind of running, volumes in the industry or your volumes actually had fallen 5% that year. Realizing there's Canada and Mexico in there. Do you think the elasticity we saw in 2Q where you got price, the volume was very weak, now you outpaced the market with 5% price. Is there elasticity after a certain period of price introduction, which is to say, you're gaining share, is that because the price increase has abated and/or we receive lots of questions from clients about the Korean's, LG,Samsung perhaps having run out of pre-tariff products. Could you just talk about price and volume dynamics related to those 2 items, elasticity and the Korean tariffs? Thank you. Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer So Ken, Marc again, so first of all, on the question of elasticity, I'm always a little bit careful to give a precise number of on elasticity, for a number of reasons. First of all, and particularly if you look at the current quarter there's sometimes difference between sell-in, i.e., what you sell into trade, sell-through and other elements. I would always argue on that full year base, there is a limited overall category price elasticity on the consumer side, i.e., I would say on a full year base, consumer prices do not necessarily impact consumer demand in a strong way. Having said that, of course, it is a highly competitive environment at any given point, you have competition out there, which drives a certain amount of elasticity. But I would argue, what we're seeing this year in the US has probably been our strongest price mix execution by any historical standard. So we are very pleased about the traction and how the team has implemented it and you're referring to laundry, I want to remind us also our first price increase was in kitchen. So this was a cost based price increase and additional mix action throughout our entire business, not just the laundry, it's also in kitchen side and we are really, really pleased with that, and I think we've proven that we -- what we understand how we manage certain categories in a highly competitive marketplace. Operator Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of J.P. Morgan. Michael Rehaut -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Thanks, good morning everyone. First question, if I could go back to Europe for a moment. And I think it makes a lot of sense, obviously, exiting some loss making regions or product lines, but if I'm looking at what you're expecting to lose for the full year, this year, it'll be a little bit above $100 million. So my question is as you look toward 2019, are there other areas, you know, perhaps top line recovery that think -- that you think could get you toward being in the black for 2019 and specifically I'm thinking about, you know, trying to stabilize or recover some of the volume loss. And obviously, it's easy to lose flooring of share and it's sometimes much harder to gain it back. So just wanted your thoughts around what additional items you need to do to push yourself back into the black and how you're thinking about the timing and the fruits of some of the upcoming labors around trying to recover some of that volume. Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Michael, I mean first of all, on these actions, which we announced, they're critical where necessary, but that's only part of the answer as you point out, first of all, beyond exiting certain loss-making business key bottom hand, we announced the fixed cost reduction which structurally lower our infrastructure cost base. That's to sustain benefits, but you have to do right, I mean we have to stabilize the volume that's what we always said, and frankly even what we've seen improvement, the improvement have been slow. In the first half as you saw in our presentation, we lost 18% volume which obviously given the fixed cost intensity of the business has a massive impact on how you deleverage and the cost you carry. In Q3, we've been able to slightly improve it to minus 12, but I mean, from minus 18 to minus 12, yes that's an improvement but it's slow, very simply because it's very difficult midyear to regain floor spots, to remotivate trade customers given certain annual agreements. Q4 started better as you saw in the presentation, we expect roughly minus 8, so it's a further improvement, but ultimately it comes back to, we want to exit the year with a pretty much a flat trend from a volume perspective and that's is the starting point to have a profitable business in Europe. James Peters -- Chief Financial Officer And Michael, on top of that, this is Jim. I would say that if you look at some of the inventory actions that we've taken to reduce our inventory levels year-over-year, a significant portion of that does come within EMEA. So there's additional deleveraging due to volume that was on top of just the volume, the share loss we had within EMEA. Michael Rehaut -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Thank you. I guess the second question to shift toward your 2018 margin walk, where you have reduced the net cost benefit from -- for the full year from 125 bps to 75 bps, I think if you look at what you've been able to do so far this year, in the first quarter, you hit that 75 bps mark, the last couple of quarters it's been more like 25 bps, if I'm looking right on those -- on that line item. So, it would imply a much stronger number for the fourth quarter. I believe, you know, well over obviously just the math dictates well over 100 bps, 125 bps of a benefit. So what's driving that 4Q waiting in terms of either are there certain actions that you expect to kick in, or better or just productivity from a higher growth number or higher volume number or revenue number. What's driving that 4Q pay off, so to speak? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Michael, it's Marc. So first of all, just for as a point of clarification, what we have in the net cost is also including freight inflation, which as you know has been massive, not particularly in US, but for most part of the world. So what do you see as a raw material tariff inflation is literally only raw material than what we see in tariff. Anything which we see on freight costs, labor inflation, all these elements are kind of a negative sitting in the net cost. Just for a point of clarification. Specifically to your question between Q3 and Q4, I want to come back to a point, which Jim made before. We made a very significant inventory reduction as a company in Q3. As you may recall, end of Q2, we pretty much had flat inventories year-over-year. If you include the Embraco inventory, in end of Q3 we're $300 million down, but as you all know, every dollar inventory captures a certain cost leverage or cost benefit, so that weighs heavily on our Q3 net cost take out, because we're deleveraging, because we took so much volume out in (inaudible) in Q3. So in a certain way, that part will not be a burden in Q4 and that explains why we're kind of in Q4 back to, I would say the run rate which you would have expected, coming out of Q1 and Q2. Operator Our next question is from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James. Sam Darkatsh -- Raymond James -- Analyst Good morning, Mark, good morning, Jim. How are you? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Sam. Sam Darkatsh -- Raymond James -- Analyst Two questions, first, with respect to the implied fourth quarter guide for US industry shipments. At least the math would suggest that it looks like you're guiding for AHAM essentially to be up mid-single digit. That optically to some could appear aggressive, especially if the series inventory and the channel gets bled down. Now favorably, I think you, I'm guessing you're baking in some pre-buy at retail ahead of your price increases, but how should we think about how you are thinking about sell-through at retail in the fourth quarter and why sell through would improve in the fourth quarter versus what we've seen earlier this year? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Sam, so first of all your observation is correct. I mean Q3 sell-in was a minus 1.7%. Keep also in mind that was still strongly impacted by a soft July and August, September started to come better. Actually in September, we saw finally kind of the overall getting closer to what we've seen through at sell through on a full-year base. And we already in the previous earnings call, we said sell-through, we see running between 0% and plus 1%, or sometimes plus 2%. So our expectation of full-year is basically that the sell-in is very similar to the sell-through, which is around this plus 1%. Particularly in Q4, to your question, first of all, I would not over-estimate the Sears inventory impact, because I think it's a lot less than you might assume. The second point is, yes, we do expect some industry shipments in -- particularly in November, December related to our already announced cost base price increases. And we also see right now, even on the sell-through trends in September and early October, that kind of -- as we are heading into the promotional periods, I think the sell-through is actually fairly solid. Sam Darkatsh -- Raymond James -- Analyst Next question. You have a lot of moving parts with free cash flow in 2018 with tax, with restructuring, with discretionary items and all that stuff. You have the long-term target of 5% to 6% of sales for free cash flow. I don't want to peg you on specific free cash flow for 2019. But can we -- how realistic is it to think that 2019 might see free cash flow in that 5% to 6% range. Knowing how many -- how much noise there was this year in free cash? James Peters -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Sam, this is Jim, and I think that's a safe assumption, as you look forward, because what -- a couple of things that will happen here is, one, obviously the pension contribution was a one-time item, $350 million and it's the equivalent of what would have been our next 5 years of pension contributions. So we've accelerated that piece and that comes out of the future years. Additionally, on the restructuring cash, we are at the peak of the payout of the restructuring cash and so that should come down over future years. And then as we look forward, while we will have a significant benefit this year from working capital, we still believe there are working capital opportunities, not at the same level, but there are working capital opportunities as we go forward into 2019. Sam Darkatsh -- Raymond James -- Analyst So 5% to 6% is realistic for next year? James Peters -- Chief Financial Officer It is, yes. Sam Darkatsh -- Raymond James -- Analyst Okay, thank you. Operator Our next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. David MacGregor -- Longbow Research -- Analyst Yes. Good morning. Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning, David. David MacGregor -- Longbow Research -- Analyst I guess, lot to talk about this quarter, we had a lot of moving parts, you guys got a lot going on. I guess, we haven't really talked about Kenmore yet, so with this year's exit, maybe you could just talk about, I know a lot of people are trying to make sense with this, can you talk just to the extent you can about potential inventory liquidation, and what kind of impact that should have on the business and maybe to the extent you're seeing order cancellation right now as a consequence of this by not just Sears, but maybe other retailers looking to get their inventory levels down, just any kind of color you can provide around that I think would be helpful to people? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer So David, it's Marc. Obviously, a lot has been written about Sears and Kenmore, and I don't need to add a whole lot to it. First of all, as we already in our announcements last week, the impact on our business is very limited. You saw in our kind of announcement we had -- at the end of the day, we had a receivable exposure for roughly around $30 million, which is very low, if you look, would have looked at historical standards, so we manage that on -- in a very proactive manner. You will also see in our details, we accrued for more than half or about half of that, and there is uncertainty around it. Now obviously Sears is in Chapter 11 process, there's a lot of moving pieces right now. I would expect that Sears will be active in the market with a certain store footprint in Q4, and we are right now, while we protect our own interests, we are at the same time in a very constructive dialog with Sears about -- and what it all means for Q4 and going forward. So I'm -- I would see very -- some serious activity also happening in Q4 and we will be part of that. But again, there's a lot of moving pieces and I think we're very well engaged in the process, we have the right support, and we manage it appropriately and accordingly as you would expect it from us. On particularly on the questions of the inventory, and the inventory liquidation, you should assume that the Sears inventory position was not very high. Sears, first of all by historically it always had a very efficient and effective supply chain, so Sears would have historically even been not the big inventory holder, and that inventory came further down over last year. So in any model you have, I would remind, don't overestimate the Sears inventory which is out there, because it's very limited. David MacGregor -- Longbow Research -- Analyst But Sears is also responsible for whatever work is in process with the manufacturers. So I guess it's a little bit bigger than just the inventory they had in their RDCs. Is there any way you can sort of give us some kind of an assessment of what it looked like a month or a couple of months worth of shipments? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer So, David, I can give you an answer for us as a manufacturer, keep in mind, we're not an overseas producer. We are largely domestic producer, so we have a benefit of a very short and responsive supply chain. So our, basically our Sears products, historically what you would call a build to order, we produce once we get the order and the forecast, so we don't have the big ships coming over across the Pacific with lot of inventory. We've built to order have a short supply chain and that's also probably the reason why our impact on our business is very limited. There is, so if you think there is some big warehouse somewhere in Ohio where we keep a lot of Kenmore units, the answer is no. Operator Our next question is from Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse. Susan Maklari -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Good morning. My first question is I wanted to think about a lot of the moving parts that are coming through in terms of how the fourth quarter margin could come together. It feels like you've got some tailwinds as it relates to some of the pricing actions that have been taken, some of the volume and maybe even some of the pull forward that can come in there. How should we think about that relative to some of the more normal trends that come through in terms of sort of promotional events and things like that? And I guess what I'm trying to get to is, could that fourth quarter margin in North America actually sort of have some of its normal seasonality negated by some of these tailwinds? James Peters -- Chief Financial Officer No, I would say that you will see within the fourth quarter for North America a similar type of margin seasonality and all that, because as you mentioned, the big drivers within there, one, it is a highly promotional period and that's very similar year-over-year, but then two, we also -- that's a -- our kitchen -- our countertop appliance business, that's the prime season for that, and so those are the 2 big drivers that affect the Q4 margins in North America, and we don't see any significant differences this year. Susan Maklari -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Okay. And then on the slides, you noted that inflation is expected to stay around that $300 million range and there are no changes. Can you just give us some context of what you've been seeing in terms of your key raw material inputs and what the outlook is for those? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Susan, it's Marc. So first of all, we said, this year we will expect raw material inflation and tariff inflation of around $350 million. As we pointed out, that is largely driven this year by steel prices, including the Section 232 effect and plastics in all forms. So these were the biggest items behind the raw material inflation, and on top of that, we have a tariff impact which impacts certain strategic components like motors or electronics. We do expect a similar effect for next year, as you've seen in our presentation. At this point, we would assume around a $300 million raw material and tariff increase which against this it's sustained, but it's certainly not higher than what we would have seen in 2018. And that largely comes from one element, it's just the carryover element of the tariff which you can quantify, and the other element is on steel, we see a stabilization or actually slightly coming down from its peak. There's still some uncertainty part particularly around the oil-based products, but uncertainty still remains, and we will -- once we see more developments, we will give an updated guidance on the real raw material outlook for 2019 in January. Operator Our next question is from Curtis Nagle of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Curtis Nagle -- Curtis Nagle of Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Marc, just a quick follow-up on, the $300 million and perhaps (ph) you guys are expecting next year. I guess could you be a little more specific on what steel price that's based on? Is it occurrence, does it assume continued walk down in price? And I don't know, I guess -- how much cushion do you think you have in that $300 million, and I guess the confidence that we don't see in another round of increases in the assumptions like we did last year and the year before? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Curtis, again first of all, again to clarify, whenever we give a raw material outlook, it is against the forward expectation. It's never against the current spot price because we typically don't, in particular with big raw material items, we don't buy spots, we have long-term contracts or we have hedges, the only element which we buy more short-term is plastics, because you can't hedge it and you can't have a full-year contract. So our outlook is against expected forward rates, not against current spot prices. Now of course, spot price always, to some extent influence what you expect on a go forward base. So what we basically outlook right now is based on steel price development and based on certain spot price, this is what we would expect to lock in on a full year base on current assumptions. So on the -- I think in the next 2 or 3 months we will get a more -- lot more clarity around this one. The uncertainty still remains about plastics. I also want to remind ourselves that in particular, in 2018, the big surprise in raw material in Q1 and Q2 was around the plastics and the sudden development of plastics. And then on top of that you had the tariffs which frankly we did not have on the horizon when we started the year. So the tariffs are now known, so we know what we're counting on this one. But of course in an environment in which we are living with a lot of inflation, there's always some uncertainty around raw material and inflation associated with that. Curtis Nagle -- Curtis Nagle of Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Okay. Fair enough, and then just a question for Jim. Yeah, I guess could you help us bridge in some detail the free cash flow for the year? I mean, you had a pretty big deficit, I understand that 4Q is a quarter where you generate cash flow, but at least historically, it looks like the gap is pretty big. So yes, just kind of in working order, what are the biggest pieces and then how confident are you in hitting that $600 million target for the year? James Peters -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Curtis, so the biggest driver overall right now year-over-year is working capital. And as I mentioned earlier, our inventory levels are significantly below where they were last year but we reduced those inventory levels in Q3 of this year versus Q4 of last year. And when we reduced them in Q3, you will also see a lower level of accounts payable, which means we have significantly less that we payout within the fourth quarter this year versus last year. That's the first biggest driver that we see. The next thing that we see on that, while we have said CapEx will be slightly lower, this year than we originally expected, most of that is coming in the fourth quarter, and that's just due to the timing of some of the investments that we are making as we expect those to flow through. And then the other thing that I mentioned in the prepared remarks earlier was the real estate portfolio optimization opportunities that we have that are partially offsetting the pension contribution. And those are about $125 million, which is coming in Q4 this year, which would be different from Q4 of last year. Operator Our next question is from Michael Dahl of RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking my questions. My first one is actually a follow-up on free cash, and I wanted to ask 2 different things about it. The first, just touching on that last response regarding working capital, just given the significant adjustments you've talked about making this year, how should we think about working cap as it relates to kind of a baseline for 2019 and whether there is further room for improvement or if it should be more neutral? James Peters -- Chief Financial Officer Well, as I said earlier, for this year, it will be a significant item for us, and a significant opportunity. As we look forward the opportunity will be smaller, but there will be continuing opportunities to reduce working capital. But this year, we are looking at that being approximately an incremental $125 million above last year. I would say next year it will not be at this year's level, but we'll continue to reduce our working capital. And that primarily comes through inventory, that's where most of our opportunities sit as we look both globally, but as well as throughout our entire product portfolio. We see opportunities to reduce our inventory levels and maintain the same levels of service. Michael Dahl -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Got it. Okay. And the second related question is really, and this ties in taxes as well, but just I want to understand better the change in tax rate expectations, and to the extent that the pension funding contributed to the lower tax rate this year, I would assume that it also is having some benefit on your cash earnings. And so I wanted to understand, kind of, you're pointing out the $800 million of, excluding voluntary items, but it seems like the tax rate would have been higher if not for the pension funding. So what's the cash impact of that from a tax benefit standpoint, and then on your overall tax rate? James Peters -- Chief Financial Officer So again, you are correct that this has an impact on our overall tax rate of about 3% for the year. So as you look at that go forward, and that's why we've said we are at 10.5% this year, we expect to be below 20% in the future years, but that 3% right now would obviously not repeat itself next year. In terms of impact to cash earnings, it's relatively small this year. If you can just think about the benefit overall on $350 million is around $40-some million. And so again, not all of that comes as cash within this year also, so that has a very small impact on our free cash flow for this year. Also, looking at the tax rate, go forward and the change we made throughout the year, what's happened is the tax regulations have evolved a lot, and it's allowed us to, at the beginning of the year, most of our tax planning strategies we had in past were no longer available, but it has allowed us to identify new opportunities. And so, we've continued to refine that as we've understood it better. Operator Our next question is from Alvaro Lacayo of Gabelli &amp; Company. Alvaro Lacayo -- Gabelli &amp; Company -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. Just one question regarding EMEA. You talked about the non-core business exits, the fixed cost reduction. Can you maybe just give us an idea of timing on when you expect to see the brunt of these benefits? And then, if you can quantify how inventory reductions impacted EMEA in 2018, that would be helpful as well. Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Alvaro, so on the first of all, on the timing of these actions, we said it's over the next few quarters, so you should think probably about the next 2 or 3 quarters where we try to exit some of these businesses. And so, the actions are under way, but it will not be done in one quarter. So it could be fast in the Hotpoint small domestic business, on Turkey we got to exit certain franchise networks, so I would say over the next few, i.e., next 2 or 3 quarters. That's when you should expect them, and that's when you should see the benefits ramping up. The same is probably true on the fixed cost where you should start seeing some benefits as of Q1 next year and then slowly ramping up. Alvaro Lacayo -- Gabelli &amp; Company -- Analyst And just on the inventory reductions, what kind of an impact it had on EMEA during -- in 2018? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer So on the Alvaro, what you have, first of all I mentioned earlier the overall company year-over-year inventory reduction of $300 million, now big part of that is actually related to Europe. So you add in Europe, the combination of both lower volumes from a sales side and an additional inventory reduction, so you should assume that kind of our entire European production base ran this year roughly with about minus 20% volume. So you had a very significant cost deleverage effect sitting in the entire 2018 numbers in Europe. Operator Our next question is from Doug Clark of Goldman Sachs. Doug Clark -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hey, great. Thanks a lot. I have 2 related questions on North America. First is in terms of the price increases that you're taking, earlier in the year you took some price increases a bit more aggressively earlier than some of the competitors. So I'm just curious if these price increases are going to be replicated throughout the industry, or if heading into the holiday season, excuse me, that might just cause some noise. That's first question. And then second question is, I'm curious if you can give us a sense of how much of your North America business in particular is purchased through financing and if the rising interest rate environment has any impact on that? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer So, Doug, it's Marc. Honestly, on pricing, I can't tell you what the other competitors will be doing, that's their decision. We take the pricing when we see cost pressures which we can't fully mitigate for mix or additional cost takeout actions. That's what we've done late last year when we announced the kitchen base and then early this year when we announced the laundry one. As you saw from -- or heard from our comments, we expect raw material and cost inflation also next year and that's why we announced the price increase which will be coming in effect in the kitchen side in early January. Obviously as you will understand, I can't make comments about our planned or unplanned price increase, because we never do it. And again I can't tell you what the competitors will be doing. All I can say is just judging on the past is that our team has been able to execute these price increases very well. The fact that we picked up market share in Q3, I think speaks volumes to how well we executed these price increases. Doug Clark -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Okay, thanks and then my question on -- Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer On the financing? I was just coming to it. You know, I would say over in North America, the pure consumer financing, I would say outside the homebuilding industry is somewhat limited. It is actually a fairly small part. There are other parts in the world like Brazil or what I mentioned earlier Turkey, where you have a significant amount of consumer financing. But the actual consumer financing on appliances in the US is somewhat limited. So if you would see an impact of rising interest rates, if at all you would've seen and you've seen it already is more on the homebuilding side, where you have to finance. But it's not so much on the -- kind of on the single unit purchase on the appliance side. Doug Clark -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Okay. And then a quick follow-up, just in EMEA (ph), if I can sneak in that quickly, I know, last quarter and you've been talking about kind of the 4% EBIT margin target in 2020. Is that still the right timeframe or has that moved a bit? Marc Bitzer -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, Doug, we still expect in or by 2020 to have an EBIT margin of 4% to 5% in Europe (ph). So that is consistent. But obviously it all is contingent on us showing now the short-term improvements both in Q4 and then for 2019. And we will obviously give more precise guidance around this one in the January earnings call. So I guess with that, I think we are at our last question. So let me maybe, as we close, let me just step back and give a little bit of additional perspective on 2018 even though it isn't over yet. I know, obviously this has been a year where the external headwinds in the form of raw materials, tariffs and currency were far greater than anybody could assume at the beginning of the year when we issued our guidance. In fact, these additional challenges amount to more than $200 million on top of the original $200 million we already planned for. Now being able to reconfirm today an all-time record ongoing earnings per share guidance in this tough environment is a result of not only a favorable tax rate, but also very strong execution of our price and cost actions. Three of our four regions have delivered margin expansions and growth and we will also turn around our disappointing Europe performance. We've also taken number of actions throughout the world to refocus and right size our business including a significant global fixed cost reduction, sale of Embraco and a number of strategic actions now under way in Europe. We have and we will continue to take all the actions necessary to manage through external challenges and improve profitability in every region. As I look forward to 2019, I am confident that the actions we've taken and the underlying strength of our business will together deliver significant value for our shareholders. So thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter earnings call on January 29th. Operator This does conclude today's Whirlpool Corporation's third quarter 2018 earnings release call. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone have a great day.

Mitch Berman,"Sometimes you can turn a vacation disaster into an unexpected gift. A vacation that was supposed to take us to the Maldives ended up bringing us to the Big Apple. No, NYC isn’t the Maldives, but our four nights in the Park Hyatt brand’s global flagship property were fantastic. In This Post Booking Both my wife and I had signed up for the previous version of Hyatt’s cobranded Visa card, while the sign-up bonus was still two free nights at any Hyatt property in the world after you spent $2,000 within the first three months. The current offer on The World Of Hyatt Credit Card is 40,000 points on a $3,000, three-month spend or 60,000 points on a $6,000, six-month spend enough to book any Hyatt for two nights. Our original plan was to redeem the four free nights we had at the Park Hyatt Maldives Hadahaa, which is the best hotel we’ve ever stayed at. However, we ended up not being able to make it to the Maldives, so instead we invited my mother to visit us in New York at Hyatt’s global flagship hotel, the Park Hyatt on West 57th Street. But my mom also had to cancel. (And, no, Mom didn’t secretly swipe our room in the Maldives.) Faced with four expiring free nights, our family of three wound up taking the subway a few stops uptown to use the room ourselves. Both sets of free nights were booked via phone, and we were lucky to get the Park Hyatt New York on short notice. Location Housed in One57, the curvy blue 1,000-foot skyscraper on West 57th Street that’s nicknamed the Billionaire Building, the hotel was near the upper edge of Midtown, two short blocks south of Central Park. As a local, I find 57th downright hellish on a summer weekday, but if you adore luxury shopping, it’s paradise, with all the world’s top luxury brands within arm’s reach. Midtown was built to accommodate quite a lot of people, but even more have been stuffed in than it can reasonably handle, so that densities during the day approached those of Asian cities. At night, however, when the stores closed and the workers went home, Midtown was spacious and even serene a lovely place for a leisurely stroll. And Carnegie Hall, right across the street from the hotel, looked beautiful at night. We visited Central Park several times. From the hotel, the Duck Pond was a 10-minute walk, and you could see the hotel from the park (the speckled blue one in the clouds, third from the right). Times Square was 10 blocks downtown, and if you think real New Yorkers never go there, then meet us. Every so often you just need a megadose of light, noise and weirdly aggressive faux Disney characters. Check-in The hotel had its own entrance on 57th Street, where we were greeted by a friendly doorman with a wide smile. The bellman accompanied us into the elevator to the lobby, one tall floor up, and directed us to the front desk. Everything from the exterior to the entrance to the interior artwork bore a Modernist semi-minimalist aesthetic that, in general, I found slightly on the tacky side, though I liked the elevators. Check-in was relatively smooth, despite the fact that we were substituting a three-person family for a single person. We had reserved a king room for my mother, requesting a high floor. We were put on the eighth floor, the lowest (rooms run up to the 23rd). I had made another request too, for a room upgrade, based on our Discoverist status (the lowest tier) that came with our Chase Hyatt cards. That also wasnt happening, no matter how I asked. The woman at the front desk offered to sell us a suite upgrade, then a rollaway for $75 a night. We were determined not to pay, however, for a bed in our hometown, where, after all, we normally sleep for nothing. I asked if we weren’t supposed to be able to get a free upgrade depending on availability at check-in. The woman said they were very busy. But I’d already ascertained that they had rooms and taken screenshots. At least two of each type of suite were available for parties of three, all four nights we were staying here. I didnt want to press my luck, though not yet. After this relatively bureaucratic initial encounter, the front desk was beyond helpful. Both the front desk and the concierge desk made a point of greeting us nearly every time we passed. Which was often, because they were right by the elevators. Room Walking into the entryway of the room, the first thing we saw was a fancy decorative metal divider and, beneath it, a modern take on an old-fashioned steamer trunk. The steamer trunk turned out to be a cabinet that cracked open to reveal a safe and magazines. The safe didnt work, and we never bothered having it fixed. Our room (a king with handcapped-accessible shower) was 525 square feet, huge for an NYC hotel room. Some of the ADA rooms go up to 825 square feet. When we entered, the TV read, Welcome, Lila. Thats my mom. (Hi, Mom!) The minibar occupied a whole corner of the room, a large cabinet that opened onto racks of chips, square jars of nuts and bottles of wine even outside the fridge. Snacks and more wine and beer were in the fridge. Prices of minibar items were prohibitive: A small jar of 22 gummy bears would set you back $18. These are gummy bears, people. They should’ve been about the cost of landfill. A Sprite was $8, and an Amstel Light was $12. There was a full-service 24/7 Morton Williams supermarket with normal supermarket prices directly across the handy crosswalk halfway down the block. So if you wanted, say, a six-pack of Amstel Light or enough Sprite to put out a good-sized fire for the same price as a single from your minibar, the supermarket would accommodate you. That corner of the room also contained a Nespresso machine and enough complimentary pods and real half-and-half to get me up in the morning. Espresso on demand may now be common in luxury hotels, but I always deeply appreciate it. Towels were large and luxuriously piled. The bathrobes, however, were a peculiarly scratchy waffle-weave of terrycloth and had seen better days. The room also contained a dedicated tablet with the New York Times and a Bang &amp; Olufsen Play Bluetooth speaker, about the size of a volleyball, that produced decent sound. And two magnificent Asian pears. Some people complain about the beds being too hard, but we found them very comfortable indeed. All except the fluffy down comforter. In August. (Why, oh why has it become standard for hotels from Premier Inns to Park Hyatts to offer only down comforters year-round? They’re perfect during the winter, but this most emphatically was not it was just under 90 degrees every day.) As you see, I’ve foregrounded the Asian pears. Anyway, the down comforter was why, soon after we arrived, we ordered a conventional blanket. We also requested another bathrobe, bath gel, a loofah, herbal tea, more Nescafe pods and bath salts, and then apologized for making such an exhaustive order. Everything came promptly except the coffee and bath salts. It turned out that it was never a problem to get as many coffee pods as we wanted during our stay, and though I’m a caffeine addict, I never had to resort to external caffeine during our stay. Closets were spacious enough. Below is the smaller of the two. The room was light-tight well, except for one questionable welcome-to-the-future luxury feature, a motion-sensitive night light under the bathroom sinks that brightened the whole place if you so much as set foot on the floor. Despite that, Id classify the Park Hyatt as good for sleeping in, and the housekeeping staff was very quiet. Our view from the eighth floor was a much lower angle than the view from the gym on the 25th floor. You had to tilt up pretty sharply in this neighborhood to see sky. The housekeepers were uniformly excellent, and special kudos go to the turndown staff, a team of friendly women who replenished our supplies of water, coffee and towels. The room also contained weird lights that turned off when they shouldnt have. The lights in the main room were on a short timer (maybe 15 minutes) that turned them off when, say, I was relatively motionless while working on a hotel review on a laptop. Moving to the spacious bathroom, the first thing I must mention is the in-mirror TV. In-mirror TV answers a need nobody realized they had. It gives you just what you always wanted to see your own face sprawling like that of a translucent god across a video landscape you apparently created. The in-mirror TV, about 12 or 13 inches, had its own separate tuner, so the audio wasn’t synced to the TV in the main room. The only real way to use it was while you spent a long time putting on your makeup. You’d have to be Reed Richards to screw your neck around to watch the TV from the tub. The tub, by the way, was great long and deep and the highlight of the bathroom. We all enjoyed it, especially with the Le Labo bath salts. The bathroom offered a full spate of amenities, with hand soap, shower gel, conditioner and lotion by Le Labo. Fresh Peruvian lilies on the double sink were a nice touch. The attractive rainfall shower head was recessed into the shower’s ceiling. Ours was an ADA shower, thus probably much larger than average. After cramming three people into a king bed for two nights, I decided I would make a hard push with the front desk for an upgrade. Just as before, we were offered a suite upgrade for $100. Most might consider that a good deal, because the suites ordinarily retail for at least $300 more than the rooms (on zero days’ notice, suites went for a cool $1,845 per night), but as local folk, we decided not to indulge. Since we still werent getting anywhere new, I asked to speak with the manager. I explained that I had just run a check for suites, and though I realized suites were a two-step upgrade from our room, Hotels.com showed at least five suites available for the next two days. Couldnt the hotel at least comp us a rollaway bed? They could and did. Food and Beverage The hotel restaurant featured a definitive view of Carnegie Hall. Mixed drinks were bold and strong. The $700 Central Park Breakfast, which included caviar and 2004 Dom Perignon, was great I mean, I’m sure it was great for those who could afford it and couldn’t think of a better use of $700. Actually, we didn’t try the food, except for the nut bowl at the bar. Unlike the $700 breakfast or the trio of pastries for $18 (just croissants), dinner entrees were not too unreasonable. Amenities The pool on the 25th floor was probably the hotels most famous feature, next to a wall of window, with a fancy modern sculpture above that gave off a faint glow. In person, the pool was deceptively smallish 61 feet in length and about 12 feet in width. It was only about 4 feet deep throughout. The room it was in was aswim with vaguely Asian New Age mood music, the kind of content thats probably been proven to tranquilize unruly children. Which may be precisely what you need here, because when we first tried the pool at about 5:00pm, it contained seven kids and three adults doing laps, enough to make it feel relatively crowded. When we returned to the pool at 8:00pm, an hour before closing, it was still relatively busy with six people. There were also quite a few guests just lounging on chaises so many that when we got there, there was only one spare chaise lounge in the place out of maybe 30. The ones that looked unoccupied were claimed, a hotel worker told me. The sauna was a steamy one. I couldn’t see anything other than that it was pretty crowded on our first visit. At other times there were plenty of seats. We enjoyed the whirlpool, a large one, about 11 square feet, about a third of which was consumed by an oddly sloping shelf. The jets were a bit tamer than I prefer, but adequate. The water was set at 101 degrees. Like the pool, the whirlpool was usually busy, with four other people besides we three when we first arrived and anywhere up to 11 people (boiled sardines) on subsequent visits. Our first time there, one kid cannonballed in. And then his brother pushed him into the main pool. Of course, such behavior is not supposed to be allowed. But it was tolerated that day by the lifeguard. On another day, the same brothers got themselves summarily kicked out of the pool for similar horseplay by another, more vigilant lifeguard. We learned then that at least some of the lifeguards were temps sent by an agency that serves only hotel pools. The pool-sauna-whirlpool complex opened very early in the morning and closed at 9:00pm sharp. The mens and womens locker rooms were rather luxurious, with all you could need, including grooming supplies, towels, robes, slippers and a centrifuge for drying swimsuits. Both men’s and women’s locker rooms offered another unusual luxury touch, a nine-jet shower. The locker rooms were fairly crowded, serving both the pool and the gym, which was up a short flight of stairs. The gym was huge and loaded with equipment. As in the rooms, there were complimentary Asian pears on offer (cosmetically inferior but tastier than the prettier ones in the rooms), along with adequate in-ear headphones. It was open 24 hours and rarely busy. The gym had a superb view of a slice of Central Park sandwiched between the JW Marriott Essex House hotel and Hampshire House. There was no real business center, just a couple of computers in the small lobby beside the front desk. If you wanted to print out a document, you emailed it to the front desk. When we did it, we expected to pick up the document later, but they brought it up to the room. There was a complimentary house car available on a first-come, first-served basis for short jaunts and I mean short, limited to about a 10-block radius (you could get them to stretch just a bit beyond). You had to be downstairs at the bell desk to check with the doorman they didnt accept reservations or phone inquiries. The drivers were quite friendly. We took the car twice, both times into Central Park. The second time, we got a nice new Mercedes S550. Speaking of the bell desk, they also had a computer and could flag taxis and give rudimentary directions. The first night I asked them the address of the Japanese market Dainobu on West 56th Street. “Nobu?” the woman asked me. No, Dainobu on 56th Street. D-A-I-N-O-B-U. The other bellperson stepped helpfully into the conversation. Did you want Nobu? I havent yet mentioned the spa, Nalai, where we dropped in a few times for the excellent view (like the pool, it was on the 25th floor), tea, dried pineapple and blanched almonds. They were quite welcoming. Spa sessions were crazy expensive both massages and facials could cost as much as $495. A couple of these and youd save money flying to Southeast Asia to get your massages! Finally, there was a tiny patio round the back of the bell desk that I’m sure doesn’t get many customers. On the eve of our departure, I asked for a late checkout, which was granted. The front desk even said we could check our luggage and then use the entire facility for the rest of the day. So that was how we got a final day at the pool and turned a four-night visit into a five-day stay. Overall Impression New York is a notoriously expensive hotel town. You normally pay a lot for a little bit of space. The Park Hyatt New York, while not feeling quite like a super-luxury hotel, offers spacious rooms by local standards and excellent service by any standard, as well as nice (if sometimes slightly peculiar) amenities. If you like Midtown or Central Park or just want a central location, the Park Hyatt is beautifully situated, and, for visitors headed to New York, a very cost-effective use of 30,000 Hyatt points (rooms cost a minimum of $595 per night, and inferior Hyatt properties in NYC charging as little as $160 per night still ask for 25,000 points per night). We enjoyed our temporary home-not-so-far-away-from-home on 57th Street! All images by the author.

newsfeedback@fool.com (Dan Caplinger),"Stocks fell on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing modestly lower but with other major benchmarks closing nearly unchanged. Investors largely recovered from an early decline following the White House decision to cancel its scheduled meeting next month with Kim Jong Un of North Korea, instead focusing mostly on economic fundamentals that remain favorable throughout much of the world. Some individual companies, however, had to deal with adversity that sent their shares lower. Petroleo Brasileiro ( NYSE:PBR ), Whirlpool ( NYSE:WHR ), and Luxoft Holding ( NYSE:LXFT ) were among the worst performers on the day. Here's why they did so poorly. Petrobras caves in to pressure Shares of Petroleo Brasileiro dropped 15% on a bad day for energy markets generally. Not only was much of the sector down due to a $1-per-barrel drop in crude prices to below $71 per barrel, but Petrobras in particular chose to reduce prices of diesel fuel in Brazil by 10%. The move came in response to truckers in Brazil who went on strike complaining about the recent surge in fuel prices. Even though the price reduction will last only 15 days, some criticized the decision because it strengthens arguments that the state-controlled oil company is still susceptible to the same political influence that has made Petrobras a focus of corruption investigations in the past. Image source: Petroleo Brasileiro. Whirlpool's tender offer disappoints Whirlpool stock dropped 8% after the appliance manufacturer announced preliminary results of its modified Dutch auction tender offer. The company said that owners of almost 7.2 million shares offered to sell their stock back to Whirlpool at prices of $159.50 per share or less, and it will therefore move forward to buy about 6.27 million shares for roughly $1 billion. The original announcement of the tender offer in late April had pushed share prices higher in the hope that investors could get a quick windfall, but in the end, the price was only slightly higher than where the stock traded before the offer. With trade concerns still looming large, Whirlpool faces further challenges ahead. Luxoft gets hammered Finally, shares of Luxoft Holding sank 24%. The global IT services provider released its fiscal fourth-quarter financial report, which included a 14% rise in sales but a 5% drop in adjusted net income from the previous year's period. Luxoft pointed to ""the impact of certain troubled accounts"" in holding back the company from fully realizing its potential, acknowledging that it needs to diversify its sources of revenue beyond some major customers. Investors are still nervous, though, about the ramping down of Luxoft's relationship with its large account in the financial services industry, and with CEO Dmitry Loschinin projecting that the current quarter will be the slowest of the fiscal year, shareholders in Luxoft seemed to prefer waiting to see how the company recovers from its challenges.",Find out which of these stocks had to deal with political scandal.,2018-05-24T20:32:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fool.com'}","Why Petrobras, Whirlpool, and Luxoft Holding Slumped Today",https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/24/why-petrobras-whirlpool-and-luxoft-holding-slumped.aspx,https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F483674%2Fpbr-rig.JPG&h=630&w=1200&op=resize,,Fool.com,whirlpool,1
"newsfeedback@fool.com (Todd Campbell, Chris Neiger, and Sean Williams)","Whirlpool Corporation ( NYSE:WHR ), Amgen Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMGN ), and Microsoft Corporation ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) are very different companies, but they all share one thing in common: Our Motley Fool contributors think now's a good time to add them to dividend portfolios. What makes these companies special? Read on to learn why Whirlpool could be a bargain-bin buy because of tariffs, Amgen could benefit from dividend growth thanks to new drugs, and Microsoft's big bet on the cloud makes it a savvy buy. Take this high-yield stock for a spin Sean Williams (Whirlpool): Although I've probably beaten the door down on Whirlpool in recent months as its share price has continued to decline, I'm going to do it once again. When it comes to top-tier dividend stocks, few if any look more attractive than appliance kingpin Whirlpool. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. There's little denying that Whirlpool is going through some tough times at the moment. In particular, the trade war building between the U.S. and other markets, including China, has pushed up the company's steel and aluminum costs, which in turn have coerced it to raise its prices in the United States. Since this is Whirlpool's most lucrative market, higher costs and weaker sales from consumer sticker shock have hurt its sales and profitability. But the thing to remember, here, is that Whirlpool has been down this road many times before. After all, it is a cyclical company. Its management team understands how to manage its expenditures and shift its focus to higher-growth regions. In recent years, the company has been buying its way into Asia, which offers a double-digit annual growth opportunity. We've also been down a similar path before, where Whirlpool has had to raise its unit prices to account for rising raw material costs. And while sticker shock is a genuine concern, it tends to last only for a few quarters. Historically, the U.S. economy has spent 86% of the time since the end of World War II in a period of economic expansion, and that bodes well for a brand-name appliance maker. Fundamentally, dipping your toes in the water also appears to make a lot of sense. At a forward P/E of just 7.6, Whirlpool is as cheap as it's been in a decade. And, as the icing on the cake, it's parsing out a 3.6% yield. It's not the flashiest or fastest-growth dividend stock by any means, but it should get the job done for your portfolio if you buy and hold for a minimum of five years. A double-digit dividend grower Todd Campbell ( Amgen): It's not the highest income producing stock in biopharma, but Amgen may offer an opportunity for upside that shouldn't be ignored by income investors. Following a 15% year-over-year increase to its dividend, its shares yield a competitive 2.7%, and thanks to new drug approvals and a packed R&amp;D pipeline, there should be plenty of dividend-friendly cash flow to support future dividend hikes. Amgen's pipeline hasn't stirred investors' imaginations as much as pipelines at smaller upstarts, but some important wins over the past few years are allowing revenue to grow despite slowing sales of its older drugs, including Neupogen, Epogen, and Enbrel. After a study showed it reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events, sales of the company's cholesterol-lowering biologic Repatha jumped 78% year over year to $148 million last quarter. Blincyto, a drug targeting a specific form of leukemia, saw sales climb 40% year over year to $60 million, and sales of Prolia, an osteoporosis drug, grew 21% to $610 million last quarter. Overall, Amgen's sales clocked in at $6.1 billion in Q2, up 4% from last year, and its EPS increased 17% to $3.83. Management now expects its top line to exceed $22.5 billion this year, up from prior guidance of at least $21.9 billion, and its EPS to eclipse $13.30, up from its prior estimate of at least $12.80. Recent approvals, including Aimovig, a migraine drug, Parsabiv, a drug used to prevent calcium from being released by bones in dialysis patients, and Kanjinti, a biosimilar approved in the EU as an alternative to the blockbuster cancer drug Herceptin, all support future sales and profit growth. R&amp;D projects, including a biosimilar to the $18 billion plus Humira and slate of immuno-oncology drugs could also move the needle for investors. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. You need to take another look at this tech giant Chris Neiger (Microsoft): Yes, there are plenty of other companies out there that can beat Microsoft's current dividend yield of about 1.6%, but what the company lacks in yield it more than makes up for in other areas. First, consider that Microsoft has a 14-year history of consecutively raising its dividend, and its dividend payments only make up about 40% of the company's free cash flow, which means it has plenty of room to increase its dividend over time. Additionally, investors should take Microsoft's cloud-computing revenue growth and potential in mind. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company grew its Intelligent Cloud sales by 23%, and it now makes up about a one-third of the company's total revenue. The company's cloud-computing growth over the past few years has helped Microsoft become the No. 2 public cloud-computing company, right behind Amazon. That's important for investors to take note of because this market will be worth an estimated $300 billion just three years from now. Finally, Microsoft grew total revenue in the fourth quarter by 17% year over year, to $30.1 billion, thanks to increasing sales from its Productivity and Business Process segment (up 13%) and its More Personal Computing segment (up 17%). With this tech giant's sales firing on all cylinders and its potential to continue benefiting from the cloud-computing market, investors would be wise to give Microsoft's stock strong consideration.",These large-cap stocks offer solid dividend income and an opportunity for upside in share prices.,2018-09-11T13:38:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fool.com'}",3 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy Right Now,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/09/11/3-top-dividend-stocks-to-buy-right-now.aspx,https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F494045%2Fgettyimages-158951998.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize,,Fool.com,whirlpool,1
Press Trust of India,"Seeing is believing, say space enthusiasts around the world as they eagerly await the first ever true image of a blackhole, which could reveal the shape of the mysterious, warped region of the spacetime fabric that has fuelled human imagination and inspired numerous sci-fi movies and literature for generations.
Using data from six telescopes located across the world, the scientists involved in the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project have imaged the Sagittarius A* -- the blackhole located at the centre of the Milky Way galaxy -- and another massive black hole 53.5 million light-years away in galaxy M87.
The results will be announced at 6.30 pm IST Wednesday.
The gravitational pull of black holes lets nothing -- not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light -- escape from inside it. This makes imaging a blackhole nearly impossible.
Blackholes swallow the surrounding gas, which swirls around in a flattened disk, spiralling into it at speeds close to light. The radiation from this hot whirlpool, however, can be seen.
Scientists have imaged this radiation, expecting to see the shadow of the blackhole against it.
""Basically, in the background light the shadow of blackhole can be seen. This is extremely important because although we had a lot of evidence about the existence of blackhole, but 'seeing is believing',"" said Sudip Bhattacharyya, Associate Professor at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai.
""If we can directly see that there is something black in the background of light -- that is an incredible thing. That would be the direct proof of blackholes,"" Bhattacharyya told PTI.
The shadow is expected to reveal the outer most edge of the blackhole -- known as the event horizon -- helping scientists view the actual shape of a blackhole for the first time.
""For example if it is a rotating blackhole then it would not look like a perfect circle or disk. It will be some what oblate, or deformed. This deformation and how the light bends around the blackhole will reveal more information about the blackhole,"" said Bhattacharyya.
Sagittarius A* has a mass approximately four million times that of the Sun, but it only looks like a tiny dot from Earth, 26 000 light-years away.
To image such a large space object, scientists used a Nobel Prize winning concept called 'Aperture Synthesis', described by British astronomer Martin Ryle where data from many small telescopes placed far apart is combined.
The technique, which has been used to make radio images for many decades, provides results similar to using a single telescope as big as the area over which the smaller ones are located.
The ETH project used eight telescopes spread over different locations in the US, Chile, Spain, Mexico, Antarctica, Mexico, Denmark and France to create a result similar to having used an Earth-sized telescope.
""The blackhole itself is like a giant lens. The light coming from behind the blackhole will not come in a straight line, like usual, but bend around its edges,"" Bhattacharyya said.
The distribution of the bent light, combine with the shape of the blackhole's shadow, will give a lot of information about the blackhole and its gravitational properties.
Space ensthusiasts took to Twitter to express their excitement as they count down to the moment.
""I think in human history we are the first generation to see the first ever picture of #Blackhole,"" one user wrote.
""This is epic, legendary, totally mind blowing. The inner kid in me is jumping up and down,"" another user said.
Some users pointed out how British physicist Stephen Hawking, who passed away last year, missed this historic moment.
In 1974, Hawking for the first time predicted the existence of Hawking radiation which are released by blackholes.
The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by astronomical pioneer and English clergyman John Michell in a letter published in November 1784.
In 1915, German scientist Albert Einstein developed his theory of general relativity, having earlier shown that gravity does influence light's motion.
Further work on the theory of general relativity helped prove the existence of blackholes.

Peter Morici,"Reading the tea leaves is getting tougher under Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Its assessment of the balance of risks between unemployment and inflation offer little guidance about the forces that will be acting on policy makers this fall and beyond. The impulse from lower taxes on consumer spending and gross domestic product growth could peter out next year. Or as supply siders in the White House predict, a lower cost of capital could set off a permanently accelerated pace of capital formation and GDP growth. The outlook for inflation has never been more uncertain. And we have a chairman who is a lawyer with little rigorous training in economics—a tinker in a land of physicists. The unemployment-inflation tradeoff has become unglued from the Phillips curve, and it’s important to bear in mind what this means. To dilettantes, the hypothesized inverse association between rates of inflation and unemployment is an empirical relationship that tells us too much economic activity causes prices to rise. More fundamentally, it’s about the elasticity of the supply of labor, and the latter appears to be very close to zero these days. As headline unemployment falls, the pace of real wage gains hardly seems to budge, because the adult labor-force participation rate remains woefully low. Hence the headline unemployment rate (the U3) is not the relevant measure of slack in the labor market. The appropriate metric would include the “unemployed” counted in U3 plus those adults on the sidelines not currently looking for work but who could be inspired by higher wages to give up welfare benefits — a very difficult number to estimate. Also, overseas workers and international labor arbitrage are increasingly important, and a stronger dollar BUXX, -0.08% could easily erase the effects of many Trump tariffs. For other reasons, the ultimate effects of tariffs on prices of many goods may not sort as initially anticipated. For example, the management at Whirlpool WHR, +0.20% is blaming the steel tariffs for declining profits — even with a recently imposed protective tariff on washing machines—but LG is expanding capacity. The Korean company appears to understand the lesson of Bush-era steel tariffs — the initial steel price spike should subside to about half as mothballed and new capacity come on line. Then LG 066570, -1.05%, with a superior product, can undercut Whirlpool by producing here and prices should fall. When asked about the juxtaposition of the 4.5% Fed estimate of the non-inflationary rate of unemployment and the observed U3 at about 4%, Powell attributed the absence of an inflationary surge mostly to market expectations. Geez that sounds like the stuff we got on Louis Rukeyser’s “Wall Street Week.” Over the next several months, the financial editors will continue to give space to stories making alarmist comparisons between monthly consumer prices this year and last. However, remember oil and gas prices fluctuate a lot, and those were depressed last year. The fact is core CPI inflation is very tame—over the last three months the annualized monthly change averaged just 1.8%. Sorting all the competing forces on inflation —in the oil market, sanctions on Iran and state entropy in Venezuela vs. booming Saudi Arabian and U.S shale production, and the supply-chain consequences of tariffs vs. a stronger dollar — it’s very tough for the trained macroeconomists who advise Chairman Powell to tell him what he should tell us about the outlook. Those macroeconomists tend to view folks who specialize in industry economics as the intellectually less fortunate who should to be banished from prestige positions at the Fed to the bowels of the Commerce Department. And Powell, unlike his predecessors, spends a lot of his energy on Capitol Hill massaging the expectations of politicians who could become his critics if he stumbles. The chairman is like the history professor pressed into service to teach a 20th century American novel class by an unforeseen absence in the English Department. He may remember Booth Tarkington wrote “The Magnificent Ambersons” — I bet Powell even has his very own copy of Keynes’s “General Theory” —but he relies on Masterplots or the yellowed lecture notes of an overworked colleague to get through the semester. With all this going on, looking to Fed statements for the outlook about inflation and interest rates six months from now is like reading the Las Vegas betting line for the 2019 Super Bowl Champion in January. It may be the Patriots or it may not.","Reading the tea leaves is getting tougher under Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, writes Peter Morici.",2018-07-30T10:01:24Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Marketwatch.com'}",Peter Morici: Reading the Fed’s tea leaves is futile,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/reading-the-feds-tea-leaves-is-futile-2018-07-30,http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GN145_tea_le_ZG_20180725173436.jpg,,Marketwatch.com,whirlpool,1

Text description provided by the architects. Caraíva is a small fishing village known for being quiet and peaceful. Located between the river and the sea, the village does not have motor vehicles and the streets are made of soft sand, so the only way to transport people and materials is by cart.

The architect created the concept of this simple and archaic weekend residence by the sea keeping local characteristics in mind. The project prioritizes regional materials and construction techniques:  wood aged with artisan techniques; burned cement floor and piaçava roofing, these items giving a calm and cozy sensation for the users.

First floor plan

The small corner lot on which the structure is built, together with the constructive limitations of IPHAN (the government agency responsible for local architectural heritage), determined that the residence should have open spaces to be used as environments for daily use. Within the 130sqm area were built four suites, a kitchen and a service area.  The remaining space is in the garden,  where there is a pergola covered with coconut tree leaves: in this space there is a whirlpool bath, a living room, the whirlpool bath of the master suite and the dining table. There is also a terrace above the kitchen with whirlpool bath for communal use and a stunning view of the sea of Bahia.

However, the 130sqm of construction could not be done in a single block, as this would be disproportionate and too large for Caraíva. For this reason three blocks were created around the pool. There is no alignment between the buildings, aiming to create the impression of spontaneous implantation of local buildings.  At the corner of the lot, a 50sqm area open to the street with a bench was maintained. It's a thoughtful urban space, welcoming pedestrians  on warmer days.

The first block houses the kitchen, toilet, pantry and an uncovered terrace with incredible sea views. The access staircase is external, with famous regional ceramics on the floor. The second block houses two bedrooms for the couple's children and has a ceramic roof with a low ceiling, as with local residences. These blocks face the street, with their height defined in order to minimize the visual impact for those outside. The third block has a piaçava cover, houses the master suites and guest suite and is situated towards the back of the lot.  Unlike the other blocks, it takes advantage of a high ceiling with a mezzanine that houses the respective double beds.

The decoration, elaborated by the owners with neutral colors and furniture, transforms the house into a space combining the rustic and the contemporary, highlighting local artisan culture.

newsfeedback@fool.com (Steve Symington),"Major market benchmarks traded mostly higher on Tuesday thanks to a rising chorus of solid earnings reports hitting the wires. But investors didn't sing the praises of every stock today. Read on to learn why Whirlpool ( NYSE:WHR ), Astec Industries ( NASDAQ:ASTE ), and JetBlue Airways ( NASDAQ:JBLU ) each tumbled. Image source: Getty Images. Whirlpool circles the drain Shares of Whirlpool fell 14.5% after the home appliance leader followed a tough quarter with disappointing guidance. Whirlpool's quarterly revenue declined 4.5% in constant currency to $5.14 billion, which translated to a GAAP net loss of $657 million, or $9.50 per share. But Whirlpool's loss was driven by $860 million in asset-impairment charges related to weak sales in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region and a preliminary antitrust settlement with the French Competition Authority. On an adjusted basis, Whilrpool's net income was $3.20 per share, down from $3.35 in the same year-ago period. ""We are pleased to deliver margin expansion in a very challenging cost environment, driven by strong North America margins and significant global price/mix improvement during the second quarter,"" added CEO Marc Bitzer. ""Despite these positives, our performance in EMEA was below expectations."" For all of 2018, Whirlpool now expects adjusted earnings per share of $14.20 to $14.80, well below the $15.63 most investors were anticipating. Astec exits a big contract Astec Industries stock plummeted 20.7% in the wake of the infrastructure, mining, and energy industry equipment manufacturer's announcement of quarterly results and a strategic exit from its obligations related to a partnership with wood pellet plant customer Highland. Astec's net sales declined 9.7% year over year to $272.5 million, translating to a net loss of $40.7 million, or $1.76 per share. At the same time, these results were largely driven by the Highland development. In particular, Astec says that due to ""unresolved issues which inhibited the plant's ability to meet contractual provisions"" under a sales contract with Highland, they ""decided in it was in both parties' best interest"" for Astec to restructure and exit its obligations regarding the plant. In exchange, Astec agreed to pay $68 million in cash over the next 120 days and forgive roughly $7 million in receivables. Excluding the effect of the contractual exit, Astec's sales would have climbed 16.5% to $347 million, and its earnings would have risen to $24 million, or $1.03 per share. JetBlue crashes on higher fuel costs, moderated growth Finally, shares of JetBlue Airways plunged 10.2% after the low-cost airline announced second-quarter sales that climbed 5% year over year to $1.928 billion -- slightly below expectations -- and a net loss of $120 million, or $0.38 per share. To be fair, that loss was driven by a $319 million pre-tax impairment charge related to the planned 2020 phaseout of its Embraer E190 fleet. Excluding the unusual item, JetBlue's adjusted earnings came to $0.38 per share -- above estimates for $0.36 per share, but down from $0.62 a year ago as average fuel prices skyrocketed 40% year over year to $2.28 per gallon. Looking forward, JetBlue also told investors it now plans to increase capacity by between 6.5% and 7.5% for the full year of 2018, tempering the high end of its previous target for an increase of between 6.5% and 8.5%.",Disappointing earnings reports sent shares of these three companies lower today.

Ry Crist,"If you're living with a cramped kitchen, or if perhaps you're shopping for a second fridge for the garage or a back room, then you might consider a compact model like the Whirlpool URB551WNGZ. At less than 2 feet wide, it's designed to take up a small footprint in your home while still offering enough storage space for your groceries (provided you don't have a full family to feed). The retail price? $1,400, though, as of writing this, you can get it on sale for about $1,260. With a clean, minimalist design that seems to echo the industrial aesthetic of designer fridges that cost thousands more, there's a lot to like about the look of this fridge -- but the cooling power left me, well, cold. Specifically, the refrigerator didn't keep things cold enough in my tests, with the entirety of the fridge compartment averaging well above 40 degrees F at its default setting. That, coupled with the fact that you can get better performance from compact competitors that cost half as much, leads me to recommend that you keep shopping around. The refrigerator's minimalism serves it well -- you won't even find a Whirlpool logo on it. Chris Monroe/CNET As compact refrigerators go, this one makes a great first impression. The clean, simple design of the exterior and the sturdy stainless steel handles help it feel fancier than it actually is, and the interior reinforces things with glass shelves, multiple drawers, a surprisingly large butter bin and even a built-in wine rack. Of course, at a retail price of $1,400 -- hundreds more than compact models from competitors like LG and GE -- you would expect more of a high-end feel, but kudos to Whirlpool for delivering.

Chris Monroe/CNET In terms of storage space, that interior offers about 8 cubic feet in the fridge and 3.4 cubic feet in the freezer, both of which are right on par with the competition. It's several inches taller than the average refrigerator, though, coming in at 74 1/2 inches high. That's too tall to fit into a lot of standard-size fridge cutouts with cabinets overhead, so make sure to measure before you buy. Despite that extra height, things still feel somewhat cramped inside the fridge, which is to be expected with a compact model like this one. There's no good spot for a gallon-size jug of milk, for instance, and I doubt that you'd be able to fit a full-size frozen pizza in the freezer, either. Plan on downsizing your groceries accordingly. Still, it's a workable refrigerator. I was able to squeeze a two-liter of soda into the bottom door shelf, and the pair of crisper bins offer plenty of space for fruits and veggies. At the top of the door, the surprisingly large butter bin runs the full width of the fridge. Relocate your spread of choice to the butter tray dangling down below (yep, the fridge includes both), and you'll be able to use that bin space for something else. Or you could just buy, like, five different kinds of butter and have room for all of them. To each their own, I say!","It's a narrow refrigerator designed for cramped kitchens, and it looks great.

Ben Schoon,"Wear OS is far from everyone’s favorite smartwatch platform, but it still offers a large ecosystem of appsand hardware. Ahead of CES 2019, Whirlpool is revealing its plans to debut a Wear OS app for controlling appliances from your wrist.
Last year, Whirlpool launched Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa support for several of its connected appliances, as well as confirming work on an Apple Watch app. Now that all of those are live, CES 2019 is bringing the reveal of a Whirlpool Wear OS application. The app is slated to arrive later in 2019.
Whirlpool Corporation is extending the mobile watch functionality of its connected appliances to include Wear OS by Google in 2019. This extended functionality will give Android users the ease and convenience of remotely communicating with select kitchen and laundry appliances while away from home.
Once it debuts, this app will give users with select Whirlpool appliances the ability to control and monitor them from their wrist. This includes controlling an oven, adjusting the active cycle on a washer/dryer, and more. Features are subject to change before the full debut, but it sounds handy nonetheless. Currently, there’s no specific release window for this app.

Reuben Jackson,"We live in an increasingly digital world. We shop, make appointments, order food and taxis, and document our lives online. Approximately 70 percent of us use social media to connect and share content, and most spend an astonishing four hours per day interacting with our smartphones. Deep learning and AI are changing the ways we consume and create media, and over the coming decade will completely transform how we drive, how we bank, what types of medical treatments we receive, and more.
Most businesses know that the digital revolution arrived long ago and that the deadline they needed to hit for upping their digital presence was yesterday. However, with so many digital trends and buzzwords being bandied about, even firms with the best intentions may be at a loss for what tools they need, but more importantly how to integrate these tools with their business. Onboarding new technologies doesnt have to be a gargantuan task. You just need the proper template: a sound digital adoption strategy.
Digital adoption is what happens when digital tools are deployed by companies in pursuit of common goals, such as reinforcing relationships with customers, reducing human capital expenditures, and pursuing automation strategies. Its no longer enough for businesses to have access to the most cutting-edge technologies. 
If your staff or customers are unsure of how to use these technologies or reluctant to use them, you wont derive any of the benefits these tools promise. Correct digital adoption sees users guided through the ins and outs of the technology so that they not only feel comfortable but fully embrace it, and in the case of employees, universally incorporate it into their workflow.
A basic example of digital adoption is Googles G Suite business applications. The paid version of which is gaining traction with corporations like Airbus, Verizon, and Whirlpool. Poor digital adoption would be an employee writing a document on the Google Docs app, downloading it as a Microsoft Word document, and then emailing the document to a colleague. In the ideal scenario, the employee writes a document directly on Google Docs, then shares it through the app interface with several colleagues so that they can all edit it in conjunction, ensuring that everyone has access to the most up-to-date version. 
In the first case, the employee used Google Docs but didnt maximize its potential in terms of time and efficiency. In the second scenario, the employee fully adopted Google Doc technology and was able to deploy it to reduce wasted time while simultaneously boosting her and her teammates productivity. 
Solving for EX and CX
In the second example, the employee experience (EX) was much smoother and less stratified than the EX described in the first scenario. As companies begin to understand that EX is intrinsic to employee motivation and retention, getting digital adoption right will become even more critical. Working to minimize superfluous technologies that overburden employees is a good start. 
The next step is choosing a system that takes employees on a personalized training journey, adapting itself to each persons pace, strengths and weaknesses. Once employees are comfortable with the platforms critical to company operations, theyll be more satisfied, have a greater context for their own work, and be more likely to relinquish their grip on the old way of doing things.
Introducing customers to your newest digital offering is just as straightforward. While you cant force them to undergo training sessions like you might an unenthusiastic or stubborn employee, you can utilize your marketing department to prepare and disseminate outstanding educational materials. Its possible to both explain to customers how to use your new technology and convince them that this technology is something they want. With an extraordinary customer experience (CX) in mind, customers will buy into the new tools but also remain engaged with them.
Generating a Positive ROI on Digital Assets 
The underlying purpose of digital adoption is to drive efficiency for business. In the internet era, the best tech to embrace often comes in the form of comprehensive business software. Content management systems (CMS), customer relationship management (CRM) platforms, and other software suites blend together business flows in a way that makes it easy to visualize whats happening, implement sweeping changes, and address issues like bottlenecking or low customer retention rates proactively. 
Accordingly, the B2B enterprise software industry is on a tear and took in over $369 billion in 2017a figure that is forecast to grow to $439 billion in 2019. More than improving efficiency, however, digital tools allow businesses to measure precisely how and why the changes theyve made produce specific results.
ROI from technologies is difficult to measure when a firm uses several different solutions, but many software platforms bring everything under one roof by outright replacing single-purpose technology or helping to plug it into the new interface. This brand of digital adoption allows businesses to see which key performance indicators (KPIs) work well, and why, whereas before this was difficult to quantify. 
Businesses can delve beneath surface level and, instead of paying attention to shallow metrics like the number of users per platform, can measure how employees and customers are interacting, how they benefit, and where they can squeeze more out of the technology. Ultimately, investing in a digital adoption strategy empowers businesses to determine which technologies are working, which are worth investigating, and which need to go.
Tying Tech Together
Whether we like it or not, the digital age is here to stay. Instead of playing catchup with continually evolving technologies, hands-on businesses can stay ahead of the curve by driving digital adoption and making it a top priority. By helping your teams and customers properly use and acclimate to any new technology you acquire, youre setting your business up for success. 
With digital adoption, you improve time usage and productivity, keep employees and customers happy, reduce churn, and overall generate a positive ROI on your digital investments. The bottom line is, digital adoption keeps you competitive. If you havent yet, its time to get your head in the game.","We live in an increasingly digital world.

Riley MacLeod,"On April Fools Day, Corsair joked about a game launcher launcher that would launch your PC game launchers. My colleague Mike Fahey and I halfway wished that it were real, and our conversation got me thinking about how many game launchers I have. Here are a whole lot of PC game launchers, ranked from best to worst, as well as a ranking of their desktop icons out of five.
Steam
I dont know if Steam is actually the best or if I just have Stockholm syndrome, but look: all my games are here. I never forget what the screenshot key is when Im on a different computer, and I can upload those screenshots to the cloud and have them whenever I need them.
The launcher does have its downsides. The pop-ups when you start it are annoying as hell, sometimes the downloads hang, and creating a group chat is needlessly confusing. But Steam has the nostalgia factor: its where I bought my first real PC game, and its probably where Ill buy my last.
Icon: 2. Its apparently a part of a steam engine, which would only be obvious if youre a travelling salesman from the 1800s. Ive spent ten years thinking it was a link from a bike chain.
Battlenet
Battlenets chat function is pretty OK. Sometimes I find my Facebook friends streaming Overwatch from the in-game stream function, which inspires me to open up Battlenet so I can play with them, only to end up watching Overwatch League instead. Intentionally or not, this launcher has encouraged me to spend a lot of time thinking about Overwatch without having to actually play it. That means I avoid making my teammates mad at me when I dont heal them quickly enough. I guess it might not be a game launcher so much as an esports launcher, but its still number two on my list.
Icon: 3. No clue what it is, but I can always tell it apart from the other stuff in my taskbar.
Epic
The lack of a playtime counter is annoying, and I hate that I have to use an outside program for screenshots and then I can never remember where theyre saved. But, as far as launchers go, its fine. I like the highly visible progress bar when a game is updating, so I can keep an eye on my update from across the room. I mostly use it for Fortnite, but every so often, I remember I have other games in my library and am pleasantly surprised to see them there. Its like a mini Christmas.
Icon: 3. Straightforward, but boring.
GOG
Every time I open GOG, I remember that I could be playing The Witcher 3. I appreciate a launcher that has my best interests in mind.
Icon: 3. See above.
Itchio
The only launcher that makes me feel like a good person, since it reminds me Im supporting all those indie games. The desktop client allows me to revisit all the tiny games I bought and then immediately lost in my files.
Icon: 4. It looks like a controller, which might be weird for a computer icon, but theres something whimsical about its design.
Uplay
This opens whenever I open a Ubisoft game on Steam, which does give me some time after I hit play to grab a drink. Also, sometimes Uplay gives me points. Ive never done anything with them, but who doesnt like getting points?
Icon: 4. I like the color on this one and its design, even if I cant tell whether its a flower or a whirlpool. Ubisoft calls it a swirl, so maybe its ice cream? Ice cream is nice.
Origin
I kind of like the way my game pages slide in from the side when I select them, but other than that, I hate this launchers guts. I can never figure out how to answer a voice or text message in a timely fashion, and it probably makes all my friends think Im a jerk. I recently bought Titanfall 2 through its store, and there were so many messages about getting Origin Premier or whatever that I almost gave up before I bought the game. (The game was good, though, so Origin has that in its favor.)
Icon: 5. God help me, but it doesnt look like anything else I have installed, and the bright color makes it easy to find.
Bethesda Launcher
This could have Skyrim on it, which is good if you need a special place just for Skyrim.
Icon: 1. Completely missable and a little bit ugly.
All those other random launchers, like Nexon or single-game launchers, that pop up whenever I turn on the office PC and I have no idea why.
Somebody wanted them, which I can at least respect.
Icon: 1. There are too many to evaluate, but they get a point for existing.
Windows Store
Never again.
Icon: 0. If its on my desktop somewhere, I dont want to know.","On April Fool’s Day, Corsair joked about a game launcher launcher that would launch your PC game launchers.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/Esa/B. Salmon (StScI) Image caption Ancient galaxies usually appear as tiny red dots to powerful telescopes The Hubble telescope has bagged an unprecedented close-up view of one of the Universe's oldest known galaxies. Astronomers were lucky when the orbiting observatory captured the image of a galaxy that existed just 500 million years after the Big Bang. The image was stretched and amplified by the natural phenomenon of gravitational lensing, unlocking unprecedented detail. Such objects usually appear as tiny red spots to powerful telescopes. Distance and age are linked in astronomy; because of the time taken for light to traverse the vast expanse in-between, we see the galaxy as it was more than 13 billion years ago. The detail evident in the image will help scientists to test theories of galaxy evolution. ""Pretty much every galaxy at that distance is an unresolved dot... it's kind of a matter of luck to get a galaxy that's lensed in just the right way to stretch it out and get that much detail - it's a pretty nice find,"" the study's lead author Brett Salmon told BBC News. Dr Salmon, from the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, added: ""By analysing the effects of gravitational lensing on the image of this galaxy, we can determine its actual size and shape."" The findings were presented at the 231st American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington DC. Natural zoom lens Gravitational lensing describes the way light is bent as it passes around a massive object between the source and an observer. This creates a kind of cosmic zoom lens, amplifying the image of a galaxy in the background. In this case, a huge galaxy cluster not only boosted the light from the more distant one but also smeared the image of it into an arc. ""The lens is not unlike the bottom of a wine glass, distorting that background image,"" said Dr Salmon. Image copyright ESA Image caption Anatomy of the Milky Way, showing the location of the disc The more ancient galaxy is relatively small, having about one-hundredth the mass of the Milky Way. It may be typical of the galaxies that emerged a relatively short time after the Big Bang. One key question for astronomers who study galaxy evolution concerns the origins of ""discs"" - a key component of the large-scale structure of many galaxies, including the Milky Way. Galactic discs are flat, rotating distributions of stars, gas, and dust. Dr Salmon commented: ""We don't really know how the first galaxies in the Universe assembled those nice rotating discs in those beautiful images we see. So when did those discs actually start to form?"" Galactic whirlpool Another study presented here at the 231st AAS meeting described evidence for rotation in galaxies that existed about 800 million years after the Big Bang. That rotation could be indicative of the beginnings of disc formation. Renske Smit, from the University of Cambridge, and colleagues, used the Alma array in Chile to show that the gas in these newborn galaxies swirled and rotated in a whirlpool motion, similar to the Milky Way and other, more mature, galaxies much later in the Universe's history. ""We expected that young galaxies would be dynamically 'messy', due to the havoc caused by exploding young stars, but these mini-galaxies show the ability to retain order and appear well regulated,"" said Dr Smit. ""Despite their small size, they are already rapidly growing to become one of the 'adult' galaxies like we live in today."" Image copyright NASA Image caption The ancient galaxy is at the limits of Hubble's capabilities Expanding on why this was potentially important, Dr Salmon said: ""Once the galaxy settles into a disc, that sets in motion the rest of the evolution of the galaxy. So finding out when that turbulent phase starts to settle down is a key initial condition."" Computer simulations suggest that discs could be present in galaxies up to 600 million years after the Big Bang. The galaxy discovered with Hubble could be one of the first to possess one. This object is right at the limits of Hubble's detection capabilities, but the James Webb Space Telescope should be able to provide much more detail. Nasa's Webb observatory is due to launch on an Ariane rocket in 2019. ""This galaxy is an exciting target for science with the Webb telescope as it offers the unique opportunity for resolving stellar populations in the very early Universe,"" explained Dr Salmon.

Liam McCabe,"Use this section as a guide to narrow in on your best fridge. We’re covering the most relevant topics in rough order of importance (size, price, reliability, style, and so on). That order is based on what we’ve heard from our expert sources and the questions we’ve heard from readers (and our own inter-staff chatter). But skip around as you see fit. Also, we only mean for this advice to apply to freestanding refrigerators. Integrated or built-in fridges are beyond our scope, and you should head to a local showroom if you’re interested in one of those. If you’re looking for a mini-fridge, we recommend a few that we like here. Size: If you’re at home, grab a tape measure and figure out how much space you have for a fridge right now. This focuses your search more than any other step you can take. Write down the width, depth, and height, all in inches. Returning a fridge is a huge pain for everyone involved, so just get it right the first time. If you only measure one dimension, make it width—that’s probably the limiting factor for what will fit in your kitchen. The most popular width now is 36 inches, but 33-inch, 30-inch, and smaller sizes are all common, too. (The actual widths are all a few fractions of an inch skinnier; we’re just rounding up for the sake of convenience.) If you only measure one dimension, make it width—that’s probably the limiting factor for what will fit in your kitchen. Depth can be a factor if you have a kitchen island or a galley-style kitchen, where you might need a shallower fridge (or at least a fridge with half-width doors that won’t bonk into a fixture when they open completely). Height can matter if you need to slide the fridge in beneath cabinets, but usually it’s the least-important dimension. Price: Paying more for a fridge (up to a point) does get you extra capacity, style, and convenient features like an ice maker or shelving flexibility. As best we can tell, paying more does not guarantee reliability, longevity, quiet operation, or better food preservation. A fair price for a no-frills, 30-inch-wide fridge with enough capacity for four people is about $600. That’s the minimum fridge we think that most households will be comfortable with, and it’s a reasonable cost if you have an older, smaller kitchen or just need something affordable on short notice to replace a broken fridge or equip a rental unit. Cheaper, smaller fridges are out there if you need them, but the storage space is pretty tight. For most people buying a fridge today, the sweet spot is a 36-inch, French door fridge with an ice maker, stainless finish, and enough storage for six, maybe seven people, including wide and tall items as needed. It should cost about $1,400. Most modern kitchens are built for a fridge of this width. If that sounds about right but you need a narrower fridge, some 33-inch and 30-inch models will fit the bill, though these sizes tend to cost a little more because they aren’t as popular. The maximum amount that we’d personally spend on a fridge is about $2,500. That gets us a 36-inch stainless steel French door fridge with a through-the-door water and ice dispenser, extra capacity, and all sorts of sharp design details like a fourth door. But you can get all kinds of different features, finishes, and designs if you’re willing to pay for them. It’s up to you to decide if you want to spend extra for, say, a black stainless finish that’ll serve as the centerpiece for your super-modern kitchen, or a hot-water dispenser that can make K-cup coffee, or a door-in-door design. While you’re shopping, remember that fridge prices can swing by hundreds of dollars in just a few days, particularly if you’re shopping at Sears. Keep your eye out for promotional deals—you shouldn’t have to wait more than a couple of weeks for one. Reliability: Try to buy a fridge that’s been available for a year or more. Older models have more user reviews, which can give you an idea about design flaws that cause problems in the first few years of ownership. Every refrigerator we researched for this guide has a few scathing negative reviews, because sometimes bad units slip out of the factory, and sometimes a botched delivery or installation can damage the machine. But don’t let a couple of one-star reviews that play the shame card scare you away from a fridge that’s great otherwise. Just keep an eye out for patterns. The main problems to watch out for are a catastrophic cooling failure or a microprocessor failure (everything has a computer in it now), which are both expensive to repair and render your fridge useless while you wait a few days for a technician to arrive. Janky ice makers and bad defrosters are also super-irritating, and can’t always be repaired, just managed. Warranties today are short, so don’t count on them. Most brands only include a year of full coverage, even on fridges that cost $2,000 or more. Sure, you could favor brands that cover parts of their fridges for longer periods, like LG or Maytag. But it’s not some kind of magical protection against breakdowns, and it doesn’t mean customer service will be easy to deal with. In our opinion, buying from a reputable, responsive dealer or working with a great service technician are your real insurance. Sears, for what it’s worth, has its own service department. Here’s a sobering view of what it’s like for a repair technician to try to work under a manufacturer’s warranty. Refrigerators sold today will last about 10 to 15 years. Your old fridge probably lasted longer than that. Steve Sheinkopf, CEO of Yale Appliance + Lighting in Boston, told us he thinks new fridges have shorter lifespans because efficiency regulations are getting strict, forcing the compressor to cycle on and off more than it did in the past. On that note, nobody can say authoritatively how any fridge will hold up relative to its competitors in 10 years, so don’t drive yourself crazy trying to figure it out. It’s tempting to lean on a brand’s historic reputation to guess at its lifespan and reliability, but that isn’t as useful as you’d think. We tried learning more about the quality of individual components in fridges and how that might affect longevity, but we mostly hit dead ends, and our sources didn’t think we’d gain much from it anyway. It’s tempting to lean on a brand’s historic reputation to guess at its lifespan and reliability, but that isn’t as useful as you’d think. A couple of major American brands changed ownership within the past decade, some foreign brands got serious about American homes, and tons of outfits have moved production facilities. So the old ways don’t mean much anymore. And finally, the brand reliability data published by J.D. Power and Consumer Reports is better than nothing but doesn’t tell you much about individual models, which is what’s really important. Style: Get whatever suits your preferences, within your size and price limitations. They do have some relative strengths and weaknesses, though, and we think most people will be happiest with either a French door if you have the space and money for it, or a top freezer if your kitchen and budget are tight. The two most popular refrigerator styles these days are French door (left) and the classic top freezer (right). French door is the most popular style now by far, according to every bit of industry data and every real-life salesperson we talked to. French door models have a bottom-mounted, drawer-style freezer and two half-width doors for the refrigerator. French door is the most popular style now by far, according to every bit of industry data and every real-life salesperson we talked to. It’s the modern look, and it makes great use of its size and capacity. It has a better layout for wide items like pizza boxes or platters than side-by-side fridges, and the double doors make it easier to open fully if your kitchen island is tight to your counters. You do have to bend over to get into the freezer, though, which some people don’t love at first but tend to get used to. Top freezer models have (no kidding) a top-mounted freezer and a full-width door on the fridge. It’s the classic refrigerator, a no-frills utilitarian cold box. Functionally, they work just like any other fridge. But except for some retro-stylized luxury models, they aren’t fashionable at all and usually have no special features to speak of, so they tend to be cheap. Many of the newest models are also very energy-efficient—like, almost as efficient as specialty fridges made for off-the-grid homes these days. If you have a kitchen island or a galley-style kitchen, the full-width door might not have the clearance to open fully, so take a measurement before you buy. Side-by-side models are split vertically, with the freezer on the left and the refrigerator on the right. The typical argument for a side-by-side design is that it’s easy to get at both fresh and frozen foods, since they’re both at eye level. The major downside is that it can be tough to fit wide items like pizza boxes or cake platters into either side of the machine. Side-by-sides also tend to be less efficient than other kinds of fridges, though it really depends on the individual model. We think most people will be happier with a French door fridge—several salespeople we spoke with said that they outsell side-by-sides “at least” 10 to 1—but it’s really up to your personal preference. Bottom freezer models are a lot like French door fridges, except the fridge door is full-width, rather than split into two half-width doors. For whatever reason, this style is not currently in fashion, apart from super-narrow units built for small, upscale condos. The wide-swinging door might have trouble opening fully near a kitchen island or other tight spaces. Some high-end refrigerators have four or even five doors. For the purposes of this guide we’re lumping them in with “regular” French door models. Another industry trend is toward “counter depth” fridges, usually French door but they can be side-by-sides as well. They’re a few inches shallower than most fridges of comparable size, although they do still jut out from the counter a bit (the doors need to swing open, after all). They tend to be expensive and have less storage space, though they can be a great fit if your kitchen island runs pretty tight with your main cabinets. Capacity: You probably don’t need to worry about capacity. A typical fridge has plenty of space for most families these days. Conventional wisdom says that a family of four can fit the essentials into an 18-cubic-foot fridge. That’s roughly the capacity of the smallest, cheapest model we recommend in this guide. For each additional person in your household, you’ll want another two cubic feet. By that measure, our main pick has enough space for a seven-person household. (The usable capacity in a fridge is always smaller than the advertised space, but our estimates are based on the advertised figures.) A more common problem is that some fridges don’t use their capacity wisely. Side-by-side fridges are the main culprit here because their shelves can be too narrow for some large pizza boxes and platters, while counter-depth fridges might be a bit too shallow for those items. Through-the-door ice makers take up a chunk of shelf space, too. Use the yellow Energy Guide sticker as your reference. The blue Energy Star badge is awarded to so many big models that it’s practically meaningless. Of course, you know better than we do how much space you need. If you keep tons of drinks in your fridge, maybe you’d find it worthwhile to get a fridge with slightly more capacity. If you’re really pressed for space in your kitchen but absolutely need more cold-storage capacity, an option is to get a second fridge. Our budget pick suits this purpose pretty well. Even a mini fridge can free up some extra room for drinks and doesn’t cost much to run. Efficiency: Use the yellow Energy Guide sticker as your reference. The blue Energy Star badge is awarded to so many big models that it’s practically meaningless, yet isn’t awarded to some super-efficient top-freezer refrigerators. Energy use is closely tied to capacity: Bigger fridges cost more to run than smaller fridges. For a 36-inch French door fridge, the government expects you’ll spend somewhere between $70 and $90 for a year of operation. Smaller top-freezers can cost less than $50 to run. (Consumer Reports tests ring up lower costs, but we’ll go with gubmint averages here.) Fridges use much, much less energy than they used to, and your electric bill will almost certainly drop after you upgrade. This calculator estimates that If you’re replacing a 10-year-old fridge, you’ll save about $30 per year on energy; if it’s a 25-year-old fridge, you’ll save about $200 per year. Noise: User reviews and Consumer Reports are your best sources for figuring out if a fridge is loud or grating or otherwise obnoxious. We’ve only recommended models with Very Good or better noise scores at CR that weren’t regularly criticized in user reviews. That said, it’s tough for anyone to guarantee you’ll personally be comfortable with a given fridge. Compressors all hum and whine at their own unique frequencies, and it’s tough to tell which combinations might drive certain people nuts but be totally cool for others. (We run into this same problem every summer when we review air conditioners.) And you can’t learn much in a showroom because the environment is too loud and the compressors are rarely turned on. If you’re the type with sensitive ears, best of luck to you. Shelves and drawers/layout: It’s mostly up to personal taste. The thing we paid the most attention to is how smoothly the drawers glide open and shut. In our experience, certain brands are “stickier” than others, and that’s the kind of thing that can drive you a little nuts if you have to deal with it every day for a decade or more. Other features to look out for, if you want them: Spill-proof shelves are useful. A folding or hide-away shelf is handy, because it lets you fit a tall bottle or cake tray from time to time without all the shenanigans of actually adjusting the height of the shelves. Gallon-door storage can free up a bunch of shelf space by letting you keep your juice or milk in the door. A good butter tray can keep butter a little warmer than the rest of the fridge, so it’s easier to slice (just make sure it’s not near the ice maker). Several French door fridges have a full-width drawer below the crisper these days; some think it’s a great place to keep snacks in a spot that kids can reach, while others think it’s too shallow to be useful. Now you can even get a door-in-door refrigerator. Usually it’s found on very high-end French door models, but it’s actually starting to trickle down to more affordable side-by-side fridges too. What’s the advantage? Well, it looks futuristic, and you might save yourself two seconds reaching for the orange juice, too. The downside is that the “showcase” door doesn’t close as easily as the main door, so it’s easier to accidentally leave it open. Ice maker: Consumer Reports has found that refrigerators with automatic ice makers are more likely to need maintenance than fridges without ice makers. Based on user feedback, common problems include cracked water lines and dispensers that freeze themselves shut. But ice makers come in almost any fridge that costs more than $900 anyway, and they’re super convenient. We scouted user ratings for models with good service records. If you use a ton of ice (when you entertain guests, for example), some fridges do crank out ice much faster than others. The spec sheet should tell you how many pounds it can crank out per day. Door dispenser: Ice and filtered water direct from the fridge is just the best. The downsides are that a dispenser usually adds hundreds to the cost of a fridge, and the ice maker takes up valuable space in the refrigerator, and it’s one more finicky feature that might need to be repaired. But if you think that’s all worth the near-magical level of convenience, go for it. Climate control and food freshness: Don’t get too worked up about this. Does lettuce wilt faster in some fridges than others? Or do blueberries mold quicker? Or do venison steaks get freezer burn sooner? Sure. But the huge majority of fridges do their job just fine. The small variance in performance makes so little practical difference that it’s not really worth obsessing about or paying extra for. It’s hard to trust claims that certain fridges are better at maintaining food freshness than others. We did hours and hours of reporting on this, talking with salespeople, repair technicians, editors at testing houses, a food scientist, and refrigerator engineers. The only details that everybody agreed on were that a fridge needs to hold temperatures between 32 and 40°F to slow the growth of harmful bacteria and mold without ruining produce and that the freezer needs to stay at or below 0°F, where it’s safe to store food indefinitely. Almost every fridge succeeds at this, and those that don’t are probably defective. It’s hard to trust claims that certain fridges are better at maintaining food freshness than others. Maybe it’s true, but under what conditions? Lower temperatures do slow the growth of bacteria and mold, but you can adjust the thermostat in any fridge. We could not find any compelling evidence that super-stable temps are better. A swing of a degree or two is fine as long as it’s in the safe zone. Humidity and ethylene exposure in the crisper drawer do affect how crisp and juicy your fruits and veggies stay over time. But nobody was willing to give us even a ballpark estimate of how many extra hours or days you’ll get from your lettuce, even in a fridge with a “flex” area or an extra evaporator. That said, lots of the slickest refrigerators have these climate features thrown in anyway. You don’t have to avoid them, although as Chris Zeisler at Repair Clinic points out, “you’re adding another refrigeration system, with some serious expense if something goes wrong.” Just don’t go out of your way to pay extra because you think you’ll make your food taste better or last longer.","The best refrigerator for you is probably the Whirlpool WRF535SMH—a reliable, affordable, French door fridge that fits a space 36 inches wide; our 65 hours of research has shown it to be the most common size and style of fridge bought in America today.

Chris Davies,"Cunning sea life could be using huge, overlapping swirls of ocean water that overlap in unexpected ways to travel great distances with minimal exertion, marine scientists are suggesting. Eddies, the swirls of water motion, are a well known phenomenon in the ocean, and can range in size up to hundreds of miles in diameter. However, something very interesting happens when they coincide. That’s what was observed for the first time by researchers at the University of Liverpool. They saw what are being described as “smoke rings” in the Tasman Sea, in the South Atlantic. Using satellite data along with temperature information of the sea surface, they figured out that the unusual visuals were the result of a pair of linked eddies, known as “modons”. “What we found was a pair of eddies spinning in opposite directions and linked to each other so that they travel together all the way across the Tasman Sea, taking six months to do it,” Chris Hughes, lead author of a study detailing the phenomenon, said of the findings. “Ocean eddies almost always head to the west, but by pairing up they can move to the east and travel ten times as fast as a normal eddy, so they carry water in unusual directions across the ocean.” That ability to carry water at high speed could be something marine life is taking advantage of, Hughes and his team suggests. Smaller creatures could be “sucked up” by the contra-rotating eddies and carried long distances across the ocean. “Rapid water transport by long-lasting modon eddy pairs in the southern midlatitude oceans,” the paper Hughes and his colleague Peter Miller authored, explains that each modon could last for around six months before breaking into individual vortices. Based on their findings, Hughes and Miller identified nine examples of long-lived modon eddy-pairs in various different bodies of water. The morons “represent an unusual pathway for propagation of water with different properties into the open ocean.” For instance, the previously observed spreading of unusually oxygenated and high-saline water from the Bass Strait into other areas of the ocean, which helps balance fish populations, could rely on eddy-pairs for its mobility. It’s not the first time high-speed movement related to the ocean has caught the attention of scientists. Earlier this year, researchers suggested ocean winds could be a huge source of currently untapped electrical power generation, were we capable of installing and maintaining sufficient wind turbines over large swathes of the seas. One 2m square kilometer wind turbine farm situated in the North Atlantic, they theorized, could potentially generate enough power to satisfy the requirements of both the US and China, with electricity to spare.","Cunning sea life could be using huge, overlapping swirls of ocean water that overlap in unexpected ways to travel great distances with minimal exertion, marine scientists are suggesting.

Jimmy Westenberg,"We’ve spent the last week meeting with companies and roaming around the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center to find the very best of CES 2019. From laptops, to smart home devices, to drones, there’s certainly a lot to take in that’s why we’ve created a list of the best products announced at CES 2019.
Here are Android Authority’s CES Top Picks 2019 Awards.
The best smartphone: Alcatel 1X
The Alcatel 1X is proof that you don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars to get a decent smartphone. For around 130 Euros, Alcatel’s new budget-friendly phone offers a 5.5-inch display, Android 8.1 Oreo, a 3,000mAh battery, and support for 4G connectivity. It also comes with this beautiful sandstone texture on the back that will instill nostalgia in any OnePlus One fan out there.
What’s more, it packs a dual 16MP and 2MP rear-camera setup, which actually turned out to be quite impressive during our hands-on time with the device. Portrait mode is surprisingly good too.
The best laptop: Dell Alienware Area-51m
Dells Alienware went back to the drawing board to overhaul its popular gaming laptop design. Called Alienware Legend, the move marks a significant change in the overall Alienware brand. That includes a reimagined shape and new color options: Lunar Light and Dark Side of the Moon. The underlying sci-fi theme fans love still remains highly relevant.
The first product based on this new Alienware Legend identity is the Area-51m. In addition to the new outward appearance, Alienware revised the internal design to provide better overclocking and a thinner form factor. All this plays host to the latest Intel Core processors and GeForce RTX 20 Series graphics. The Area-51m initiates a new era for Alienware and its fans.
The best smartwatch: Kate Spade Scallop Smartwatch 2
A ton of smartwatches were announced at the trade show this year, and the best one came from Kate Spade. We’re giving the Kate Spade Scallop Smartwatch 2 an award this year because it was clear the team listened to user feedback. With an on-board GPS and heart rate sensor, the Scallop Smartwatch 2 is now a capable fitness companion not just a pretty watch.
Watch:The best smartwatches from CES 2019
Let’s be honest, this is still a pretty watch, though. The flower-like design surrounding the bezel adds to the classy aesthetic, backed up by the understated silicone strap and stainless steel case. Of course, the iconic spade icon is scattered throughout, adorning the rotatable crown and on the top of each Kate Spade watch face.
A pretty, feature-packed smartwatch. What more could you ask for?
The best fitness product: Withings Move ECG
Hands-on: Withings packed an ECG into its new customizable hybrid watch (Video!)
The Withings team is back in full force after its brief time at Nokia, and it just announced two new fitness watches called the Withings Move and Withings Move ECG. The Move ECG won Android Authority’s Best Fitness Product Award due to the overall quality of product and benefit users will get out of the electrocardiogram.
ECGs can be literal life savers for some people, and the fact that it’s packed into an attractive, affordable, and customizable fitness watch should not be overlooked. At $130, the Withings Move ECG is a no-brainer if you frequent the doctor for heart problems.
The best smart home product: Google Assistant Connect
For years Google has been trying to become the one-stop shop for smart home products, and the Google Assistant Connect is its next big push to bring even more Assistant-connected products to your life.
Assistant Connect is a set of capabilities that product manufacturers can use to connect their own products to Google Assistant-powered devices like the Google Home or Home Hub. If a product was developed with Assistant Connect, it’s able to talk to nearby Assistant devices and display your personal information (i.e. calendar events/weather) on the screen.
The most obvious example is if a company were to create a simple display without any mics or speakers, including Assistant Connect would allow it to show you content from your linked smart speaker. In this case, the smart speaker would handle all the computing on its own while using Assistant Connect to transfer and display that content on the display.
It’s an inexpensive and easy way for companies to bring Assistant to their products, which is why it’s deserving of our Best Smart Home Product award.
The best audio product: Audio Technica ATH-ANC900BT
Few audio companies have the professional history of Audio-Technica, and when they throw their hat in the ring, we pay attention. Taking aim at the top end of active noise cancelling headphones, the ATH-ANC900BT has the firepower to be a blast.
By using a more energy efficient Bluetooth 5 connection, the ATH-ANC900BT has the specs to outlast the likes of Bose, Sony, and Sennheiser’s top-of-the-line headphones. Additionally, they’re also the most affordable entry into the top-end of ANC headsets, coming in at only $299.
The best concept: Whirlpool Connected Hub Wall Oven
Whirlpool surprised us this year when it showed off its Smart Countertop Oven, produced under its WLabs brand.
The WLabs Smart Countertop Oven automatically detects the type of food you’re cooking. You can then choose from additional cooking options based on your preferences. For example, if you’re cooking pizza, the Smart Countertop will give you a range of crispiness to to choose from.
The best smartphones at CES 2019
Whirlpool is also the first on the market with a product that can distinguish between frozen and non-frozen food. Its current cooking algorithm is set to a 95 percent confidence interval too, so cooking times and settings should be very accurate.
What impressed us most, however, is Whirlpool’s planned distribution model for this product. Whirlpool will ship just two thousand units in the coming weeks for $799 each. We’re told the reasoning behind launching under the WLabs brand is so that Whirlpool can better gather user feedback and tweak anything accordingly. That way, it can improve the experience even further before launching a mainstream consumer product.
Overall, we were quite impressed with Whirlpool’s work as is. So, we’re very happy to see a commitment to develop the concept further.
The best mobile accessory: Corning Gorilla Glass Personalized Phone Case
The Corning Gorilla Glass personalized phone case is a surprisingly fun new addition to the mobile protection market. Corning will print any photo you like on the back of its Gorilla Glass 5 which then gets embedded into a rubberized case for your smartphone. The final product is a sturdy case with a smooth, elegant glass back that also has a picture of your spouse, kids, family, pets, or anything, really.
Eventually, Corning will have vending machines that will print you a case in a matter of minutes. Just upload your photo to a web server, tell the machine which phone you own, and a few minutes later your brand new case will pop out. Keeping your phone free of scratches and dents has never been this cool.
Best innovation: LG Signature OLED TV R
LG’s Signature OLED TV R is something we’ve only ever imagined or seen in a movie or TV show. It may shape the future of TVs forever, which is why it wins our Best Innovation Award.
Watch:LG’s rollable OLED TV at CES 2019
A prototype of the TV was shown off at CES 2018, but this year the rollable TV is a real product that consumers will actually be able to buy. The way it beautifully rolls and rises out of the sound bar feels like pure magic. The TV is there when you want it, and disappears when you don’t. It can even be there when you only partially want it. The horizon-line view shows only a fraction of the display for quick access to basic functions. It’s cool, futuristic, and will be a game changer to the TV industry.
Spotlight Awards
It’s easy to focus on the biggest names in technology at trade shows as big as CES. That’s why Android Authority has chosen six of our favorite innovative tech products that may have flown under the radar.
Jabra Elite 85h
Elevating their wireless headphones game, the new Jabra Elite 85h are noise-cancelling cans made for folks on the go.
Equipped with SmartSound, these over-ear headphones adapt automatically to produce the best sound for phone calls, music, and more. Coming in four colors with a rain resistant build, enjoy ANC on the go for up to 32 hours of battery life, even longer with ANC turned off. ANC auto switching turns on and off the service based on your environment. Of course, the Jabra Elite 85h also sound great, and you can adjust the EQ and sound profiles through the Jabra Sound+ app for extra sound clarity.
Insta360 ONE X
Weather you’re skiing down a mountain or hiking up a cliff, the Insta360 ONE X should be just the thing you need to capture great 360-degree video. This 4K-capable camera features Insta360’s FlowState Stabilization, which means smooth footage even in the most
Nuu Mobile G4
Nuu Mobile showed off its brand new G4 smartphone at CES 2019, and it provides some killer value at a cheap price. It comes with a big 6.2-inch display, a 2GHz MediaTek Helio P60 processor, dual 16 + 8MP rear cameras, and it runs Android 9.0 Pie.
The best part? You can get all of that for just $249 in March 2019.

Apartment Therapy Submissions,"Name: Andrew, Kelly, and Cecilia McMahon—and Doris, the family dog Location: South Orange County, California Size: 1,600 square feet Years lived in: 7 years, owned Our historic California bungalow has been reborn and we love it! As a musician ( Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness ), I spend as much time on the road as I do at our home. My love of travel started early, growing up all over the U.S., however California has been home for most of my life. As far back as I can remember I've always dreamed of owning a quintessential California bungalow. Finding a historic home, built in the '20s, when so much of Southern California was undeveloped, was really appealing to my wife and I. When we walked through the door of our current home, we knew this was the one! Although the original structure was smaller than we liked, the location and original details were perfect. For us, hitting the road is a family affair; Kelly (my wife), Cecilia (my daughter) and Doris (the family dog) usually travel with me when our band is on tour. So when we decided it was time to expand, the goal was to make our home feel like a retreat, a place for relaxation and inspiration. We brought in Los Angeles interior designer Kim Hayden Holt, who worked with us on a previous house, to reimagine the space. Taking inspiration from my Pinterest boards, and my love for geometric elements, Kim introduced strong graphic statements through materials, art, and custom design elements in each and every space. Our ""new"" bungalow is laid-back, unconventional, cozy, inviting, and fun. Every space is beautiful yet functional, as Kim seamlessly blended both my wife's beach bohemian style and my mid-century modern sensibility to create a compelling interior that captures who we are. Each room speaks a unique language; the sun-filled bedroom feels like a tranquil hideout. We love the whimsical hanging chair where Kelly reads to Cecilia. Behind the bed, the chevron patterned white oak and lacquered wood focal wall creates a cool visual rhythm. The vintage airline poster circa 1955 captures the wonder of travel from the mid-century era, and combined with the textural rugs and sheepskin throws it creates a bedroom that is calm, cool, and comforting. The light, bright open kitchen and dining area have become the soul of our house and are always in use as a hub for gathering family and friends. Kim personalized this space with artwork from one of our favorite photographers, Jimmy Marble, as well as a mid-century Saarinen style dining table and chairs, mirrored panels in the cabinets and a blue (our favorite color) open-ended kitchen island. We each wanted to have a private escape in our home, mine is my studio space, Kelly has her office incorporating a built-in desk, a reading nook, and a place to exercise, and our daughter has her own teepee in her bedroom. The dining room and bedroom open to the backyard where we as a family love spending time. The outdoor covered patio is one of the most coveted spaces on the property. During the day it is the perfect place to catch up on email or read a great book. In the evening the space transforms into a lively environment for dinner with friends, a family movie night, or to just hangout by the welcoming fire. We look forward to coming home after being on a long tour, it is the perfect home for us and a comfortable chill atmosphere to recharge our spirit. ""For the McMahons' home the goal was to create a personal oasis that captured the clients' adventurous spirit while being comfortable and functional,"" explains our designer Kim Hayden Holt. ""We are always telling stories by the colors, materials, and objects we surround ourselves with, for the McMahons, that meant calming blues tones (their favorite) mixed with crisp salt-air whites, natural woods mixed with bold details, and personal elements such as amazing artwork and found objects picked up on a stroll along the local beach. Nature served as inspiration throughout the house. When selecting wall coverings for the dining room, inspiration came from Andrew's band, 'Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness,'; after all what better way to start your day than with breakfast in the Enchanted Forest! The graphic treatments on the floors and walls make the interior spaces perfect backdrops for creating those great Instagram stories."" Apartment Therapy Survey: Our Style: Kelly, my wife leans more towards the vintage and ornate and I've always leaned more modern. Inspiration: Merging the influences of the original architecture with a fresh and bohemian design. We wanted the house to be fun and functional. The goal was to park the cars on the weekend and know we could hide out there and feel like we were on vacation and we do! It was also important that we maintain the original façade of the house to blend in with the neighborhood. Favorite Element: I love the kitchen/dining area. There are so many thoughtful touches in that space and it has become a backdrop for some amazing memories. From an aesthetic standpoint, I love the brass inlays and chevron detail on the island, the custom glass in the cupboards, and the floor detail on the way to the outdoor spaces; it's all a visual treat. Biggest Challenge: Working on the fly. When we originally submitted plans to the city Kelly was pregnant, however we didn't really know what being parents was like or how it would impact our current lifestyle. Since our home is historic, the approval process from the city took forever and our needs changed a lot. We originally brought Kim in to help us rework the main living area and we did that project first before tackling the addition. We fell in love with the design so much that we turned the project over to her room by room. Getting all the trades on the same page during that process was not always easy, especially being on the road. It was an intense workflow for everyone but I'm so glad we did it in the end. Proudest DIY: The studio. Designing that space became my pet project and it was a lot of fun experimenting with pieces of furniture and art (that had once lived in the main house) to find the right layout that inspired me creatively. There was a lot of trial and error, but it was inspiring to take ownership of the place where I create. Biggest Indulgence: The custom cabinetry throughout the house. Because the home is relatively small we invested a lot in storage that was both functional and really beautiful. I always smile at the attention to detail found in each of those pieces. Kelly wanted to incorporate the original door knobs and other details of the house and it turned out beautifully. Best Advice: Make a budget and lay out your priorities early so the costs don't get out of control. Custom cabinetry and other custom design elements can add up quickly, so talk about what is the most important and splurge on those items.

Andrew Myrick,"Nest has been around for the better part of a decade and the company provides some of the best smart home products around. Nest got was founded by a couple of Apple engineers, and then was acquired by Google in 2014. Since then, we have seen many improvements and innovation in the world of smart thermostats, cameras, and more.

With its popularity, more and more companies have integrated their products to make them easier to work with Nest. Here's a look at all of those aforementioned products that currently ""work with Nest"".It should come as no surprise that integration between Nest and Google Home is deep. Google acquired the company back in 2014, and recently merged Nest into Google's hardware division. This means that the Nest products are being developed directly alongside Google's Home products.

Patrick Gillespie,"The tax, or tariff, starts at 20% for the first 1.2 million imported washers this year. It then goes up to 50% for every other washer brought in after that. Americans buy lots of washers from other countries, and trade experts have some advice. ""Anybody who is thinking about buying a washing machine should do it right away,"" said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It's too soon to say how much price tags will go up -- but everyone agrees they will eventually head north. A few factors are at play. For one, foreign-made washing machines will become more expensive to import. To remain competitive, manufacturers outside the U.S. likely won't pass the entire cost of the tariff onto customers, but prices will go up some. The tariff could likely drive consumers away from foreign-made washers and give American-made washing machines a boost. ""Washer machine manufacturers importing products for the U.S. market are expected to face a significant price disadvantage as compared to U.S. domestic manufacturers,"" says Hye Ming Song, an expert on consumer appliances at Euromonitor International. That means the largest U.S. manufacturer of washing machines, Whirlpool, now faces a little less foreign competition, paving the way for the company to raise its washer prices. Whirlpool hasn't indicated whether it will raise prices, but historically American companies tend to hike prices on customers when they face fewer foreign competitors due to tariffs or quotas. Prices won't go up overnight -- trade experts say it will take a few months. Foreign-made washing machines have recently grown more popular in the United States, so home appliance stores like Home Depot and Lowe's may have a large inventory of washing machines stashed in their storage facilities. Mexico exported to $240 million of washers to the United States in 2016; China sent $425 million worth; South Korean companies made $130 million of washers for the U.S. market, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent body that investigates trade complaints. Samsung and LG are among the top exporters of washers to the United States. For Samsung, the tariffs are somewhat puzzling because it moved production of its washing machines two weeks ago to a new plant in South Carolina that will employ 600 Americans. Samsung said Monday that ""everyone will pay more, with fewer choices."" LG added that it was very disappointed with Trump's tariffs. The tariffs add a wrinkle to the renegotiation of NAFTA, the trade pact between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Talks resumed Tuesday, and Mexican officials noted that they will respond to the tariffs. But if Mexico retaliates, it may not be an old fashioned, tit-for-tat response, experts say. For example, Mexico buys lots of corn and soybeans from the United States. It's already been importing more of those commodities from Brazil and Argentina. Instead of adding a tariff on American corn or soy, Mexico could simply ramp up imports from South America. ""The Mexicans are in a good position there in terms of being able to retaliate without imposing costs on [Mexican] consumers,"" says Matthew Rooney, director of economic growth at the Bush Institute in Texas. Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull out of NAFTA if talks fail to achieve a deal that benefits American manufacturing workers. That would be a negative for the economy. ""Growth in the United States will slow down dramatically if we pull out of NAFTA,"" Rooney adds. ""Most of the downside of these policies won't be felt immediately... the political price will come in 2019 and beyond."" --Alanna Petroff contributed reporting to this article from Davos, Switzerland CNNMoney (New York) First published January 23, 2018: 2:20 PM ET","The Trump administration is applying tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines.

Bryan Adams,"In recent days it's been hard to avoid the mysterious laughing Alexa. Headlines such as ""Alexa's laughing at us"" or ""Amazon assistant Alexa not yet a domestic goddess"" were shared on social media far and wide. Amazon customers shared videos of their voice-controlled home devices producing an unprovoked laugh, described as ""creepy"" and ""spontaneous."" Amazon says it knows why this is happening. Apparently, on occasion, Alexa can mistakenly hear the words, ""Alexa, laugh"" when other words are spoken near it. In a statement they said they are going to disable the command and change it to ""Alexa, can you laugh?"" where she'll respond, ""Sure, I can laugh."" So I guess that's that. All of this got me thinking about voice assistant devices in general. According to Alpine AI's January 2018 estimates, there are now over one billion voice searches across devices per month. With those kinds of numbers, your business should get involved. Some of the biggest brands are already ahead of the curve. Voice activation is ideal for lazy nights and take-out food on the sofa. Dominos was quick off the mark, and in addition to ordering pizza via voice, you can now input your favorite Dominos pizza and have it remembered for future voice orders. Whirlpool responded to a different Alpine AI report which showed ""home automation"" as the second-most popular voice device feature by introducing home appliances operated by voice control. Siri has been able to request Uber rides and updates since late 2016, and now this feature is available via Alexa and Google Home. Also since 2016, PayPal has made it possible to use Siri on an iPhone or iPad iOS 10 to send and request money from a contact with a voice command. Making this accessible in 30 countries, Siri connects with the PayPal app, pulling up a details sheet of the transaction before your authorization. So, the big players are investing in voice and reaping the benefit. But all they do is sell products or services, just like your business. So if they are getting involved, what's stopping you? Much like having an app or a mobile-first website, voice activation is another platform that you need to consider, and being found in a voice search is as crucial as being found on a mobile, tablet or desktop. Getting involved in voice needn't be complex. Here are three ways to get you started: 1. Alexa Skills Kit Amazon has put together a brilliant guide to getting involved with voice. Much like building an app or a website, there are rules to follow and guidelines to consider. It includes their Voice Design Guide, which leads you through all the stages of the design process: Learn, Design, Build and Launch. You'll need to consider the questions users will ask and the way your design will respond, and the guide includes a checklist to make sure your interaction feels natural, responds accurately and gives great service. Consider working with a Voice User Interface agency for more support. 2.Schema markup If you're not ready to design your own voice interaction, then at the very least you need to make sure your business is showing up in voice search results. A great way to help make this happen is to make use of structured data called Schema markup. Schema helps search engines understand the content of your website. When direct questions are being asked of the likes of Alexa, such as ""Where can I buy a new laptop?"" accurate schema markup will help your laptop business show up in search results. There's a brilliant tool for creating schema markup over at Microdata Generator and you can then check your data structure with Google. 3. Conversational content and understanding intent Your content is crucial for success in voice search. Questions asked of the likes of Alexa and Siri are more structured than when we type. We speak as if to a friend or partner. Make sure your content is answering the questions searchers will ask in a natural way. Write conversational, informative content. Try to understand the intent behind the query. If the user is asking about the differences between a Macbook and a Surface they may just be researching their purchase. If they are asking how much a Macbook costs then they are more intent on making a purchase. Make sure your content includes long tail keywords that will have relevance to that intent. This longtail keyword generator can help you work these out. Voice is here to stay. Make sure your brand gets heard.",Give your business a voice to get ahead of the competition,2018-03-15T09:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",3 Ways to Get Your Business to Appear in Alexa and Google Home Searches,https://www.inc.com/bryan-adams/3-ways-to-get-your-business-to-appear-in-alexa-google-home-searches.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_532150042_200014602000928077_349053.jpg,,Inc.com,whirlpool,1

Adjusted for one-time items, however, Whirlpool's earnings checked in at $3.20 per share during the second quarter, still lower than the prior year's $3.35 and short of analysts' calling for $3.43 per share. Sales checked in at $5.1 billion for the second quarter, which was also below analysts' estimates of $5.3 billion. Image source: Getty Images.

https://www.facebook.com/lindseybever,"Arkansas wildlife officials are urging boaters to avoid a section of a river in the northern part of the state after a sinkhole opened up and created a dangerous whirlpool that led to a man’s death. Officials with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission confirmed in a statement that a man was killed Saturday afternoon in “ a fatal boating accident ” when the sinkhole opened up near the Spring River’s Sadler Falls near Dead Man’s Curve. The 57-mile-long river, which runs through Arkansas and Missouri, is known for water sports, such as canoeing, kayaking and rafting, and fishing. Arkansas Game and Fish Commission spokesman Trey Reid said Monday that the victim has been identified as Donald Wright, 64, from Searcy, Ark. Though the details remain unclear, Reid said witnesses reported that when the sinkhole opened and formed the whirlpool, boaters were ejected from their boats. The victim, who was in a kayak, paddled toward the whirlpool to try to help them. Officials said the sinkhole opened up in the river bed near Sadler Falls, which is about 150 miles northeast of Little Rock. The U.S. Geological Survey states that sinkholes occur when groundwater dissolves bedrock — such as carbonate rock, limestone or salt beds — creating open spaces underground. When the ground can no longer support itself, it collapses, creating a depression — or a sinkhole, according to the USGS. When this happens underwater, it can create circular currents, such as whirlpools. Reid, from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, said that in such cases when the riverbed breaks away, the water must go somewhere and, in the process, creates a current “like a bathtub drain.” Video showed a flip-flop, a plastic water bottle and other debris swirling around it. Workers from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission and Fulton County installed buoys Saturday to secure the area around the whirlpool, according to the statement from the commission. The commission said that local residents and tourists can still access Spring River but should avoid the barricaded area. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokeswoman Laurie Driver said in a statement Monday that the agency is working with the county to help find a solution. “We are assisting the county by providing contact information for agencies which may be able to assist with the sinkhole on the Spring River,” it read. “Our Regulatory Division will reach out to the county to provide information on the permitting requirements which may be needed in conjunction with any repair.” Read more: ‘They just keep coming’: A dozen sinkholes have opened up in this Florida neighborhood A sinkhole swallowed 2 Florida homes in hours.

John D. Stoll,"Jennifer Hanna would be a dream hire for the many companies wrestling with talent shortages these days. Having worked in factories since 1991, she is responsible for more than 1,000 people building KitchenAid stand mixers that sit on countertops around the world. Ms. Hanna, though, has worked for KitchenAids owner
Whirlpool Corp.
 WHR 1.95%
since she was a high-school graduate figuring how to pay for college. It would be hard to lure her away.
The appliance giant helped pay her way through community college and Ohios University of Findlay, then handed her increasing responsibility, encouraged her pursuit of an M.B.A. and put her on KitchenAids senior leadership team.
As the U.S. labor market continues to tighten, companies are reaping decades of underinvestment in their workers. Blame it on a wave of skilled baby boomers retiring or colleges teaching the wrong things or a lack of loyalty among younger workers. The harder it gets to find the next generation of Jenni Hannas, the bigger the headaches get in the human-resources department. 
If youre the person who is in charge of finding staff, they want you to go out and find the unicorn, Andrew Angyal, founder of NexGen Recruiting in Youngstown, Ohio, said. They want all these people with 10, 20 years of experience and, if you do happen to find them, its a big question of whether you can pay them enough.
Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School, says the several years of dogged focus on skills shortfalls in Americas talent pool has convinced many senior executives that investing in people is someone elses responsibility.
Conventional wisdom now says theyre just going to leave if you train them, Mr. Cappelli said. They were persuaded it wasnt their problem, it was the schools problem. No one wants to tell the CEO theyre wrong.
Heres something for the suggestion box: If the CEO wont listen, send them to Greenville, Ohio, for a field trip. 
Its where KitchenAids workers churn out millions of stand mixers annually, painting them in 80 different colors and fitting dozens of bits and pieces into the machines chugging down crowded assembly lines. Employees in other parts of the plant will soon assemble two new blenders. 
The operation halts without people coming to work every day. Ms. Hanna says it takes six weeks to learn how to build a stand mixer, but the most important skill a prospect brings to Whirlpool is work ethic. Everything else can be taught. 
Ms. Hanna is proof, having graduated from high school with a stellar GPA but not enough money for college. I wanted to find a company that would invest in me at the age of 18. That was in the early 1990s, when the U.S. economy was in recession, and manufacturing jobs were in decline.
Over time, she developed an appreciation for various corners of Whirlpools business. Building dishwashers inspired her to learn more about plastics technology, for instance. Leading an assembly plant became a goal. Without Whirlpools aid, she would have shouldered the entire cost$75,000 at todays tuition ratesto fund the education she needed to climb the ranks and likely gone to work everyday mired in debt. 
Maggie Hammaker, a 28-year-old assembly supervisor at the mixer factory, is among those walking in Ms. Hannas footsteps. She manages about 100 people. 
Ms. Hammaker showed up on the factorys doorstep at 19 with no idea of what she wanted to do. It was just a job, she figured, and considered a career in the military. Bitten by the learning bug, she enrolled at Sinclair Community College in nearby Dayton, taking business, communications and environmental ethics classes. 
Its not a dead-end job anymore, Ms. Hammaker said. 
Whirlpools tuition-reimbursement strategy isnt unique: 88% of companies offer some type of education assistance, according to Salary.com. Employees eat these programs up. Bright Horizons, an education benefits provider, says 56% of workers would not pursue education without employer support. 
Additionally, $440 billion has been spent on corporate-training initiatives since 2013, according to a survey by Training Magazine. 
The numbers are big when considered in aggregate, but its fair to wonder if they shouldnt be bigger once you consider them being spread among millions of workers. Annual tuition reimbursements are capped by companies at an average $3,871, Salary.com estimates. Firms spend less than a thousand bucks annually in training per worker, not including tuition reimbursement, according to Training Magazine.
Mr. Cappelli, the Wharton professor, said tuition assistance is now treated like a benefitlike gym reimbursements or 401(k) retirement-fund contributionsrather than viewed as an apprenticeship. Training is too often outsourced or not specifically geared to fix the skills shortage so many executives complain about. 
Bright Horizons recently polled 22,000 people about the effectiveness of training programs and the data indicates they improve attraction and retention. Nearly 80% said the aid made them more likely to stay with the organization and 60% were offered a promotion within two years of graduation. 
In an era when millennials are being lured by tech startups with ping-pong tables or daily happy hours, the data suggest the better bet for many companies is an offer to send them back to school. 
In Wichita, Kan., aerospace companies have employed several tactics to address the shortage of aviation workers.
Textron Inc.s
aviation unit, building Cessnas and other airplanes, has needed to offer higher pay to attract engine mechanics being increasingly wooed by growing airlines or sectors outside of aviation, such as wind turbines.
Textron and another Wichita company,
Spirit AeroSystems,
are getting more creative even in hiring for less-skilled jobs. Both work with Wichita State University Tech to recruit entry-level workers to Kansas. In addition to paying relocation costs, the program funds several weeks of schooling, provides a stipend and guarantees a job interview. 
Textron Aviation hires about 1,000 people in the Wichita area a year, or 8% of its workforce. Spirit is in the midst of adding 1,400 jobs. 
 Suzanne Scott, director of workforce readiness at Spirit, says the WSU program gets more candidates in the door. But it takes a deeper investment to keep them around. Ms. Scott said the company recently created the Grow Your Own initiative, which boosts use of apprentices and pairs them with coaches. 
We were able to get more experienced aviation-type employees a few years ago and that became less so in the last couple of years, Ms. Scott noted. We realized we too needed to change internally.
 Keturah Austin, Spirits spokeswoman, said the Grow Your Own plan will outlast the tough hiring situation. Even if it were a great labor market and there were tons of candidates to choose from, the way we have expanded our recruiting and retention is how it will be going forward. Its no longer good enough to put an ad in the paper or host a job fair.

Jason Kottke,"What a marvelous little photo essay by Christopher Payne and Sam Anderson about General Pencil, one of the last remaining pencil factories in America. Other parts of the factory are eruptions of color. Red pencils wait, in orderly grids, to be dipped into bright blue paint. A worker named Maria matches the color of her shirt and nail polish to the shade of the pastel cores being manufactured each week. One of the company’s signature products, white pastels, have to be made in a dedicated machine, separated from every other color. At the tipping machine, a whirlpool of pink erasers twists, supervised patiently by a woman wearing a bindi. You can see many more of Payne’s photos of General Pencil on his website. Here’s Maria, her shirt and nails red to match the color of the pastel cores. There are also a couple of videos of the General Pencil factory: And this older one that shows much more of the pencil-making process. Neither video includes a shot of the belt sander sharpening system… you can see that in action here.

"Arthur Delaney, Dave Jamieson","WASHINGTON ― A moment that corporate executives may have dreaded for years has finally arrived. As Congress chips away at bank regulations established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, another part of the measure is exposing the extreme income inequality between bosses and their workers. The law requires publicly traded companies to calculate the ratio of their chief executive officer’s compensation to the median pay of the companies’ employees. After a series of delays, firms are finally disclosing their pay ratios in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some of the numbers are shocking. The staffing firm ManpowerGroup paid its chief executive $11.9 million last year ― 2,483 times the average employee’s earnings. The firm noted in its disclosure that most of its employees are temps who work only part of the year, making just $4,828 on average. ManpowerGroup’s ratio is the most lopsided of any disclosed thus far, according to Proxy Insight, a company that tracks SEC disclosures for investors. Excluding firms with no employees, the average ratio among the more than 263 disclosures to date is 77 to 1, with CEO pay averaging $7.2 million compared to $93,000 for the typical worker. Other notable ratios for big firms include the appliance maker Whirlpool Corporation, which paid its CEO 356 times what it paid its average worker, and the health insurance company Humana, whose top executive earned 344 times more than the median salary for employees. The disclosures come as Democrats and Republicans wage a rhetorical battle over who benefits most from the massive corporate tax cut President Donald Trump signed into law late last year. While Republicans have touted modest bonuses several million workers have received from various companies, Democrats have kept a running tally of share buybacks, which inflate the value of a company’s stock and enrich executives. Stock awards represent a substantial portion of executive compensation. Companies have long disclosed executive pay as part of their SEC filings, but what’s new is the requirement that they also own up to what they pay their rank and file. Paired together, the numbers can serve as a barometer for economic inequality within particular firms. Lisa Gilbert, a lobbyist and expert on executive pay with the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said that if company leaders dreaded this day, they were right to do so. “It’s embarrassing,” Gilbert said. “We’re learning how little they pay their workers. We’re learning how much they pay their CEOs, and the ratios are stark.” Although it has little regulatory impact, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio was one of the most contentious pieces of the Dodd-Frank legislation. It took the SEC three years to issue a proposal for firms to disclose the ratio, over the fierce objection of corporate lobbyists. The business community argued it would be too difficult and costly to calculate the ratios. Some regulators sympathized. Two Republican members of the SEC voted against the rule, and one of them, Michael Piwowar, said its real intent was to “shame” executives. The rule’s b ackers argued that both investors and employees have a right to know when executive pay is grossly out of step with typical workers’ salaries, saying it sheds light on a company and its priorities. Labor groups have used industry-level wage data to calculate worker-to-CEO pay ratio estimates to spotlight pay inequity. The AFL-CIO reported last year that among more than 400 companies traded on the S&amp;P 500, the average CEO made 347 times more than his or her’s average worker. Executive compensation has grown far faster than overall wages, according to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. It found that in 1965, executives earned merely 20 times more than their average employee. For some firms, the ratio alone can obscure important details about employee compensation, such as whether workers reside in areas with a low cost of living and what their hours are, said Tim Bartl, CEO of the Center on Executive Compensation, a group that opposed the pay rule. “Unless you get into the details, it doesn’t tell you a whole lot,” Bartl said. Still, some companies in their disclosures appear eager to erase their lowest-paid employees from existence to make the pay ratios less conspicuous. ManpowerGroup, the temporary staffing firm, offered an alternative ratio that excluded the temp workers who are at the heart of its business model. The company noted in its SEC filing that its CEO earned only 276 times as much as the firm’s permanent employees. Marathon Petroleum Corporation is another firm with an eye-popping ratio. CEO Gary Heminger earned nearly $20 million last year ― 935 times more than the median Marathon employee. The company blamed the disparity on the thousands of workers at its Speedway gas station subsidiary. Gas station cashiers earned an average of just $9.83 per hour last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the company could wave a wand and make those low-wage workers disappear, then its CEO-to-worker pay ratio would be a much more reasonable 156-1, the company said.",And some firms seem a little embarrassed.,2018-03-13T17:00:50Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Companies Are Disclosing How Much Less They Pay Workers Than Executives,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ceo-pay-disclosure_us_5aa6da18e4b03c9edfae9aec,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa6dafd1f00001803169e9b.jpeg?cache=uo4hlzy2de&ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,whirlpool,1

These were outlined in a Google blog post (via PhoneArena ), where Google took the opportunity re-establish some of the previously supported devices and Google Assistant features; essentially, it’s a Google roundup of ways to control your home. Your Android phone or Google Home can now take advantage of support for C by GE light bulbs for turning the lights on, off and managing their dimming settings in any room. In addition, the Google Assistant supports fans from Bond — should you wish to keep the house even cooler this winter — while Google also singled-out ecobee and Nest for further temperature control (though these have been compatible with Google Assistant for some time now). Keeping with the hot water theme, Smarter now has a kettle that supports Google Assistant, as of earlier this month, while Whirlpool has a range of supported microwaves and ovens. Meanwhile, LG is still the go-to brand for washers, refrigerators, and dryers. Finally, those who want an overview of their home can use the Google Home and a Chromecast in conjunction with a connected camera like the Logitech Circle.

Tess Wilson,"We've seen this kitchen a million times before: aggressively honey paneled cabinetry, dark mottled stone countertops, beige floor, and an above-window wooden flourishplus a bonus ruffly ceiling fan. Will the cupboards be painted white? That's close, but also way off... First, let's read a bit about this home and how its new owners approached its rejuvenation: Four months ago we took the challenge of remodeling a mid-century ranch house that was stuck on the '60s. Filled with carpet and red bricks in a segmented plan, the project took about four months of hard work. As a surface and interior designer, I had the plans in my head during the very first visit to the house. With my handy designer husband, I decided to rip out some walls, re-layout the bathrooms, demo most of the rooms and rebuild it with a very simple sleek style. The concept was to have it as clean as possible so we could add accent elements and colors to the interiors. Accents can easily be changed out over the years, unlike walls and floors. Let's see how that clean concept came to life. Truly: wow! We see a lot of renovations in which everything is painted white, but in this case, everything was completely ripped out and replaced with pristine, incredibly luxurious whiteand near-whitematerials. Sandra Romanoff and the aforementioned husband have created a room that could be described as monochromatic, I suppose, but there's actually so much happening. The marble backsplash has dramatic veining, the quartz countertops add subtle sparkle and texture, the whitewashed floor is muted but with visible wood grain and tonal variation. The stainless appliances contribute a cool gleam that's balanced by the warmth of the gorgeous, dramatically grained stools and the soft floor. All of the recessed lights are the opposite of a ruffly fan, and they really help open up the space fully. I know some of you will find this to be sterile, but to me it's serene and soothingan exquisitely neutral backdrop against which to create meals, messes, and fun. And oh my goodness, it must be so satisfying to clean! Here's how Sandra went from totally typical to a sleek spaceship: With an open plan, the kitchen became a special challenge. We wanted to avoid overspending with expensive custom cabinets and get some room to invest on nice stones for the countertop and backsplash. On the process we went through more than five different layouts for the kitchen: one with a very large island, other with no microwave, other with no pantry. We also spend some time getting quotes from different types of work, what landed in my husband picking the kitchen as his personal project. Yes, he ended up getting his hands dirty building the cabinets from Ikea SEKTION. The peninsula demanded a lot of customizing work, where he had to build the whole wood structure to fit the waterfall white quartz. A house is an endless project for us, we're always looking for ways to make it look fresh, bringing new pieces of furniture and objects. The cabinets are IKEA SEKTION (customized), the backsplash is a Volakas marble slab, the appliances are from Whirlpool, and the stools are sheesham wood. Thank you, Sandra Romanoff !","We've seen this kitchen a million times before: aggressively honey paneled cabinetry, dark mottled stone countertops, beige floor, and an above-window wooden flourish—plus a bonus ruffly ceiling fan.

The Value Investor,"Whirlpool ( WHR ) is the latest business in which investors are no longer ¨accepting¨ the promise of a low earnings multiple, based on adjusted earnings. While I typically avoid situations of heavy earnings adjustments, reality is that even based on realistic earnings, valuations are non-demanding, as there is room for progress. At the same time, I do not like the track record all that much, as leverage is reasonably high. Despite these concerns, the cheapness argument is a dominant factor, making that I have initiated a position following the latest slump, yet lack conviction to buy in size given the risks. Leading In A Difficult Market The name Whirlpool is well recognised by consumers in many developed countries across the globe. In fact, the company has outlined a vision to become the best branded consumer products company of the world, yet the company has built up quite a reputation of over-promising, and under-delivering, at least in my eyes. The company claims to have been an excellent operator, yet reality is that reported sales of $21.3 billion in 2017 come in just 10% above the revenue number reported a decade ago. This results in zero, or even negative sales growth if you adjust for inflation. The company has typically posted volatile margins, with adjusted margins on average coming in at just mid-single digits, yet these margins are adjusted earnings and not GAAP earnings. One has to recognise that charges are both sizeable and recurring all the time. Its namesake business and many other brands such as Bauknecht and Maytag combined bring in $21.3 billion in sales in 2017 on which the company reported an adjusted EBIT margin of 6.4%. Despite relatively good economic conditions, margins were down nearly a full point despite all the initiatives to make the business more profitable, with declining margins being attributed to inflationary pressures. The company is furthermore experiencing entirely different drivers in each market. The relatively consolidated North American market allows for EBIT margins in the low-double digits. Latin America and Asia are expected to post margins in the mid-single digits, as the EMEA region is hardly profitable at all, despite improving economic conditions. Nonetheless, adjusted earnings still totalled $13.74 per share as the company guided for modest gains in 2018. Alongside the release of the 2017 numbers, Whirlpool guided for 3% sales growth to $21.9 billion, with adjusted EBIT margins expected to recover to 7.5%. Note that this is still a long way from achieving the 2020 target, calling for 10% margins. Margin expansion and modest growth should allow adjusted earnings to improve to $15 per share this year, plus or minus half a dollar. Struggles Continue 2017 has been a year of struggles as the company was forced to cut the full year guidance three times if I remember correctly. Adjusted earnings came in at $13.74 per share last year, down from a $14.06 per share number in 2016. Reported GAAP earnings totalled just $4.70 per share last year as the large discrepancy was largely the result of significant restructuring charges and tax-related charges, yet those restructuring costs are showing up all the time and are not really ¨one-time¨ events. In April, the company reiterated its adjusted earnings guidance, calling for earnings of $15.00 per share plus or minus fifty cents, with GAAP earnings seen at $12.80 per share, plus or minus fifty cents. Shares fell as investors were not happy with the lack of real progress, especially in relation to the 2020 targets. Nonetheless management used the dip to pursue a billion-dollar accelerated buyback program to buy 6.3 million shares at $159.50 per share. Second quarter results provided just more bad news, after investors have been ¨surprised¨ by continued disappointments. Excluding currency swing, revenues were down by 4.5% to $5.1 billion, which the company attributes to real challenges within the European segment. This furthermore came after first quarter comparable sales were already down by 0.7%, which makes that the company is forced to cut the guidance yet again, as prospects for growth in 2018 are rapidly diminishing. After the company managed to keep first quarter adjusted margins flat at 6.0%, the company actually managed to grow adjusted operating margins by 20 basis points in the second quarter towards 6.7% of sales. That bit of progress was overshadowed by a huge $9.50 per share GAAP loss, being largely the result of a $747 million impairment charge taken on acquisitions being made in Europe in recent years. For the year, the company has cut the adjusted earnings guidance by half a dollar to $14.50 per share, plus or minus thirty cents. GAAP earnings are seen at just $0.45 per share, plus or minus thirty cents. Note that the impairment charge is equivalent to $10.91 per share ahead of taxes, as the remainder of the difference results from restructuring and anti-trust settlements. After adding back the non-cash impairment charge, I see realistic earnings at levels closer to $9-$10 per share. This makes that trading at $128 per share, following a 15% decline in response to the latest disappointment, shares now go for just 13-14 times realistic GAAP earnings and just 9 times adjusted earnings. What About The Financial State? Following a few years of continued buybacks, expensive acquisitions in Europe and even a $1 billion accelerated buyback/tender during the second quarter, Whirlpool has taken on quite a bit of debt. Ending the quarter with $1.06 billion in cash and operating with $6.84 billion in regular debt, net debt stands at $5.8 billion. This furthermore excludes nearly $1.3 billion in pension and post-retirement benefits appearing on the liability side of the balance sheet, pushing up the realistic net leverage position towards $7 billion. Based on the revised adjusted earnings guidance, the company expects to earn about a billion in adjusted net profits. After adding back a 20% tax rate and $180 million in interest expenses, adjusted operating earnings came in at $1.43 billion. With D&amp;A charges running at a rate of $680 million a year, I peg adjusted EBITDA at $2.1 billion. This makes that based on regular debt, leverage ratios stand at 2.7 times, or 3.3 times including pension liabilities. Note that the company still has to close the divestiture of the Embraco compressor business, which brings in about a billion dollar in proceeds, reducing leverage ratios a little further. What About Those 2020 Targets? While the company sees solid growth and EBIT margins of 10% under its 2020 targets, it seems clear that those targets are not within reach. If you believe that Whirlpool can deliver on its promises, it could post EBIT of about $2.2-$2.3 billion in just two years from now. With interest expenses running at $180 million a year, and applying a 20% tax rate, after-tax earnings could amount to $24 per share! Trading at $128 per share, the resulting 5-6 times forward earnings multiple tells you at the same time that the market is not buying these rosy predictions. After all, if the earnings number is realistic, why would shares not trade at a market multiple at a valuation between $400 and $500 per share? There are two problems with the 2020 outlook, or actually three. Sales growth is lacklustre, but that is not the biggest risk. The real bigger challenge is to boost margins by 3 points in a year or two from now, which simply seems a bridge too far. The third issue is the fact that one-time charges continue to show up as a recurring charge, often involving cash outflows, and often being sizeable as well. Worse of all, the company is not even near close to achieving its targets, during a great economic point in time, as this remains a cyclical business after all. Another risk is that with technology the company is looking to apply their technological skills into household appliances as well, creating potentially formidable competitors. I personally see peak margins at 8% instead of 10%. After applying a discount for ¨one-time¨ charges, margins might more realistically come in at 5% on roughly $22 billion in sales. That works out to $1.1 billion in EBIT, for $750 million in net earnings. The resulting earnings power of $11 per share is still pretty decent, for a 12 times multiple, but I recognise that the company has taken on some leverage and does not have a great (growth) track record. I do not like the tendency of over-promising and under-delivering, making that I apply a discount to the management team, certainly after the recent tender offer, which was executed at too high prices. Yet after shares have continued to fall further, I am buying a third of my targeted position at current levels.

"24/7 Wall Street, Evan Comen, 24/7 Wall Street","President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum has resulted in retaliation from the country's closest trading partners, which at least one analyst warns will cost American jobs. (June 26) AP Earlier this week, motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson announced plans to shift some of its production overseas to avoid retaliatory tariffs recently imposed by the EU in response to tariffs by the Trump administration. While the iconic American brand is shifting jobs to other countries, a number of major U.S. manufacturers have made significant efforts to add […] (Photo: Kinwun / iStock) Earlier this week, motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson announced plans to shift some of its production overseas to avoid retaliatory tariffs recently imposed by the EU in response to tariffs by the Trump administration. While the iconic American brand is shifting jobs to other countries, a number of major U.S. manufacturers have made significant efforts to add or retain jobs in the United States over the past several years. According to advocacy group Reshoring Initiative, the number of jobs being reshored by U.S. companies has increased more than tenfold since 2010. Each company has its own reasons for consolidating manufacturing operations in the United States, and the number of jobs and size of investment involved in the reshoring projects also vary by company. To determine which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America, 24/7 Wall Street used data provided by Reshoring Initiative based on company announcements from 2010 through the first quarter of 2018. The 16 companies announcing the largest reshoring initiatives plan to bring back, add, or retain a combined total of approximately 73,000 manufacturing jobs.

Insulet Corp. Total jobs reshored: 1,500 States benefiting: Massachusetts Industry: Biotechnology Headquarters: Billerica, Massachusetts Insulet Corporation manufactures insulin delivery systems. In 2017 the company announced it would be moving the production of its flagship product -- the Omnipod, a tubeless, waterproof insulin pump -- from China to a new facility in Acton, Massachusetts. Insulet cited the area's skilled workforce and rising labor costs in China as reasons for the move. If Insulet meets earnings expectations for the next several years, the new facility could employ as many as 1,500 workers by 2021. (Photo: Courtesy of Element Electronics) 15. Element Electronics Total jobs reshored: 1,500 States benefiting: Michigan, South Carolina Industry: Consumer electronics Headquarters: Winnsboro, South Carolina In 2012, South Carolina-based consumer electronics manufacturer Element Electronics opened a new flat screen television factory in Detroit. The decision was based on a need to consolidate the company's supply chain, and made Element one of the only companies to manufacture televisions in the U.S. Element also reshored production from China to Winnsboro, South Carolina with an initial $7.5 million investment in a new plant that is projected to lead to the creation of 500 jobs. The TV manufacturer cited Walmart's pledge to buy $250 billion of U.S.-made products from 2013 to 2023 as a primary reason to relocate operations to the United States. (Photo: Courtesy of Gentex) 14. Gentex Total jobs reshored: 1,600 States benefiting: Michigan Industry: Motor vehicle parts Headquarters: Zeeland, Michigan Over the last several years, mirror manufacturer Gentex closed its two plants in China and Mexico in an effort to centralize production in Zeeland, Michigan. While labor was less expensive overseas, the move to consolidate all stages of production in one location is likely to reduce transportation costs and the risk of manufacturing error. According to the Reshoring Initiative, the company's reshoring efforts since 2010 amount to a total of 1,600 jobs for U.S. workers. (Photo: Coolcaesar / Wikimedia Commons) 13. Amgen Total jobs reshored: 1,600 States benefiting: Rhode Island, TBD Industry: Pharmaceuticals Headquarters: Thousand Oaks, California In a January 2018 meeting with President Donald Trump, Amgen CEO Robert Bradway announced that the firm was planning to add 1,600 manufacturing jobs in the U.S. The announcement came several years after the biopharma company cut approximately 15% of its workforce and closed two U.S. manufacturing facilities in 2014 as part of major cost-saving efforts. Most recently, Amgen announced in February 2018 that it would invest $300 million in a new U.S. biologics plant that would employ approximately 300 workers upon completion. An April 2018 recent press release from the company named West Greenwich, Rhode Island, as the site of the new facility. More: What are the worst companies to work for?

Total jobs reshored: 1,633 States benefiting: New Jersey, TBD Industry: Pharmaceuticals Headquarters: Kenilworth, New Jersey In July 2017, the White House announced that Merck, along with pharmaceutical manufacturers Pfizer and Corning, have committed to making a joint investment of at least $4 billion in pharmaceutical glass manufacturing in the U.S. The partnership will focus on the manufacturing of advanced pharmaceutical glass packing, a technology used in the storage of injectable drugs, as well as vials and cartridges, and is projected to lead to the direct hiring of 4,000 U.S. employees across the three companies. Merck also recently reshored approximately 300 jobs as part of its efforts to consolidate its overseas operations in the U.S. The company relocated the headquarters of its animal health division from Boxmeer, the Netherlands to its campus in Summit, New Jersey in 2013 as part of a larger restructuring effort.

SolarCity Total jobs reshored: 1,900 States benefiting: New York Industry: Energy production &amp; storage Headquarters: San Mateo, California In 2014, SolarCity announced a deal with the State of New York that commits the company to invest approximately $5 billion over the next 10 years in return for a $750 million construction subsidy that is projected to create at least 1,900 jobs. The investment is focused around the construction of a new facility in South Buffalo. Without major government subsidies, domestic manufacturing of solar panels has largely been prohibitively expensive, as U.S. labor costs were too high compared to other countries. While the project stalled for several years as SolarCity reevaluated its timeframe and was taken over by Tesla, solar roof tile production began at the new factory in December 2017.

Polaris Industries Total jobs reshored: 2,000 States benefiting: Alabama Industry: Transportation equipment Headquarters: Deerfield, Illinois In January 2015, automotive manufacturer Polaris Industries announced plans to build a $142 million off-road vehicle plant in Huntsville, Alabama that will create an estimated 2,000 manufacturing jobs in the area. The move was likely prompted by the generous tax breaks offered by state and local governments. Polaris is projected to receive approximately $80 million in tax breaks from the city of Huntsville and state of Alabama upon completion and staffing of the facility. The announcement comes several years after the company was criticized for downsizing its plant in Osceola, Wisconsin and building a new facility in Monterrey, Mexico for approximately $150 million.

Caterpillar Total jobs reshored: 2,100 States benefiting: Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Texas Industry: Construction &amp; farm machinery Headquarters: Peoria, Illinois According to the Reshoring Initiative, over the last several years construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar has announced reshoring projects that will target facilities in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and Texas, and will add or retain an estimated 2,100 U.S. manufacturing jobs. In 2012, Caterpillar opened a new facility in Victoria, Texas with an initial investment of $200 million in an effort to shift production of its hydraulic excavators from Akashi, Japan to the U.S. In August 2015, Caterpillar announced plans to expand employment at its Victoria facility, moving its vocational truck manufacturing operations from Mexico to the Texas location.

Whirlpool Total jobs reshored: 2,165 States benefiting: Ohio Industry: Electronics, electrical equipment Headquarters: Benton Harbor, Michigan Since 2010, Whirlpool has announced several efforts to consolidate its overseas operations within the U.S. that will add up to an estimated 2,165 reshored jobs for domestic manufacturing workers. Most recently, in January 2018 Whirlpool announced it would be adding 200 full-time employees to its facility in Clyde, Ohio. The news came shortly after the Trump Administration announced safeguard tariffs on large imported residential washing machines, a move projected to reduce import competition from Whirlpool rivals Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics.

General Electric Total jobs reshored: 2,656 States benefiting: Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina, New York, Ohio Industry: Industrial machinery Headquarters: Boston, Massachusetts Since 2010, General Electric has announced domestic capital investments that are projected to add approximately 2,700 jobs to the U.S. manufacturing workforce. Much of the reshoring efforts are based around Appliance Park, a newly renovated production facility in Louisville, Kentucky, and shifting the production of bottom-mounted refrigerators and front-load washing machines from China and Mexico to the U.S. According to GE, reasons for the move include lower transportation costs, a more qualified workforce, and significant tax incentives by state and local governments.

Dow Chemical Total jobs reshored: 2,900 States benefiting: Louisiana, Michigan, Texas Industry: Chemicals Headquarters: Midland, Michigan In March 2015, Dow Chemical announced plans to invest $6 billion in its manufacturing plants in Texas and Louisiana in an effort to capitalize on lower domestic natural gas prices. According to a Dow executive, the increase in U.S. fracking activity has created significant investment prospects for chemical producers in the United States that will pay off in the next several years. The Gulf Coast reshoring effort is largely focused on the production of ethylene, propylene, and chemical derivatives used in packaging. The company's reshoring efforts announced over the past several years are projected to retain or add approximately 2,900 manufacturing jobs to the U.S. (Photo: Coolcaesar / Wikimedia Commons) 5. Intel Total jobs reshored: 4,000 States benefiting: Arizona, California, Oregon Industry: Semiconductors &amp; other electronic components Headquarters: Santa Clara, California In 2011, Intel announced plans to hire 4,000 U.S. workers and build a $5 billion microprocessor plant in Chandler, Arizona. Known as Fab 42, the plant will use the 7-nanometer production process and is projected to be the most advanced, high-volume microprocessor plant in the world. While the facility was completed in 2013, its opening was stalled for several years. In February 2017, however, Intel announced plans to open the facility with a total investment of $7 billion and the direct hiring of 3,000 high-tech, high-wage workers. The tech giant projects the plant will be completed in the next two to three years, and will indirectly lead to the creation of roughly 10,000 jobs throughout Arizona. (Photo: ford.com) 4. Ford Total jobs reshored: 4,200 States benefiting: Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New York Industry: Motor vehicles &amp; parts Headquarters: Dearborn, Michigan In January 2017, Ford announced plans to cancel the $1.6 billion expansion of its Mexico production facility, instead opting to expand operations at its Flat Rock, Michigan facility with a $700 million investment projected to create 700 jobs. Similar reshoring efforts by the U.S. auto giant have been announced over the past eight years, targeting facilities in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, New York, and other parts of Michigan and totaling an estimated 4,200 new jobs for the domestic workforce. Like General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, Ford's announcements were made amid pressure from the current administration to reduce investment overseas and increase capital investments in the U.S. manufacturing sector. While some analysts speculate the reshoring efforts are a response to the Trump administration's push for domestic job creation, Ford representatives have noted that they were based on an initiative to expand its truck and S.U.V. model offerings for U.S. consumers, which was previously agreed to in a labor contract with the United Automobile Workers union.

Boeing Total jobs reshored: 7,725 States benefiting: Missouri, Montana, South Carolina Industry: Aerospace &amp; defense Headquarters: Chicago, Illinois Over the past several years, Boeing has rapidly expanded its U.S. workforce at various manufacturing plants throughout the East Coast. Boeing began operations at a new plant in Charleston, South Carolina in 2011 that manufactures 787 Dreamliner planes. Boeing also recently moved parts of its production of the new 777X plane from overseas to its St. Louis facility. The first 777X is projected to be completed by December 2019. According to the Reshoring Initiative, since 2010 Boeing has announced plans to reshore approximately 8,000 jobs, the most of any U.S. company other than General Motors and Apple.

General Motors Total jobs reshored: 12,988 States benefiting: Michigan, New York, Tennessee, Texas Industry: Motor vehicles &amp; parts Headquarters: Detroit, Michigan Over the past several years, General Motors has made several announcements regarding various reshoring efforts that will boost employment at its plants in Michigan, New York, Tennessee, and Texas. The largest announcement came January 2017, when GM made public its plans to add or retain 7,000 jobs in the U.S. over the next few years. One of the major reshoring projects will be the shifting of approximately 600 jobs from an axle production plant in Mexico to a new facility in Arlington, Texas. GM's reshoring efforts announced since 2010 amount to roughly 13,000 jobs, the most of any U.S. company other than Apple. (Photo: ymgerman / Shutterstock.com) 1. Apple Total jobs reshored: 22,200 States benefiting: Texas, TBD Industry: Computers, office equipment Headquarters: Cupertino, California In January 2018, Apple announced plans to invest over $30 billion in capital expenditures in the U.S. over the next five years. As part of the investment, Apple is increasing its commitment to its Advanced Manufacturing Fund -- used to invest in U.S. manufacturing companies and boost the domestic manufacturing sector -- from $1 billion to $5 billion. The move is projected to create over 20,000 new jobs at Apple's existing campuses and at a new office location which has yet to be announced. Apple's job creation announcement comes amid criticism aimed at the company for its outsourcing of manufacturing jobs to China, and accusations that it has dodged U.S. taxes by keeping some $250 billion overseas. A March 2017 press release from Apple claims the company supports some 4.8 million jobs in China, compared to 2.0 million in the U.S. President Trump says the era of ""global freeloading"" is over. He told rallygoers in Fargo, North Dakota, that his tariff standoff with China, the European Union and Canada is aimed at fixing his predecessors' ""disastrous trade deals."" (June 28) AP While companies have been under significant pressure over the past decade to invest in the domestic manufacturing sector, many of the companies bringing the most jobs back to America are not necessarily doing so for political reasons. Some of the most common reasons cited for reshoring manufacturing jobs are to capitalize on the brand value of the Made in USA label, proximity to the U.S. customer base, the country’s skilled workforce, and government incentives. More: Public sector jobs: States where the most people work for the government Many companies have also cited Walmart’s pledge to buy $250 billion of American-made products between 2013 and 2023 as a primary reason for shifting operations to the United States. The pledge has reduced some of the risk of relocating production to the United States and has helped companies such as Element Electronics, which won a contract with Walmart shortly after opening a small flat-screen television plant in Michigan, make the decision to reshore. To determine which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America, 24/7 Wall St. used data provided by the Reshoring Initiative based on reshoring announcements from 2010 through the first quarter of 2018. Data is based on reshoring announcements and press releases gathered and quantified by the Reshoring Initiative. Only companies that had already completed significant offshoring projects, or had specifically chosen to manufacture in the U.S. over offshore options, were considered. Companies were ranked based on the total number of jobs they plan to add or retain in the United States through domestic capital investments. 24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Natacha Butler,"Paris - There was a moment in the French presidential campaign last year when Emmanuel Macron took a big risk. The centrist candidate had travelled to his home town of Amiens in northern France to meet trade union leaders from the US-owned Whirlpool factory. The company's bosses planned to shut their French operation and move it to Poland where costs were lower. Hundreds of local jobs would be lost. While Macron listened to the concerns of union leaders in the town centre far from the factory, his main presidential rival, the far-right anti-EU candidate Marine Le Pen, turned up at Whirlpool to the delight of the striking workers who posed for selfies with the woman who promised to save their jobs from what she said were the claws of Europe and globalisation. Macron had a choice: face being politically upstaged and appear out of touch, or show courage, take a gamble and play to win. Macron chose the latter. The dramatic images of Macron wading into a crowd of furious workers at the factory, engulfed in the smoke of burning tyres, made waves in France. Macron tried to convince the strikers of his vision: that France needed to adapt to a changing world. He may not be able to save old industry if elected, he said, but he would invest in workers' futures with training schemes and new opportunities. It is unlikely Macron's vision convinced many at Whirlpool that day but his frank approach had won respect. The gamble had paid off. Courageous or arrogant One year into his presidency it is clear that Macron's Whirlpool moment was not mere electioneering but emblematic of his style. He is uncompromising in his beliefs and fearless in tackling his critics. It's an approach seen as courageous or arrogant depending on one's perspective. Where most voters agree is on Macron's international record. Opinion polls suggest people are pleased he has raised France's profile, with air strikes in Syria, planning reforms for Europe or taking a lead on climate change or the Iran deal. A proponent of multilateralism, he says France must talk to everyone. His friendship with the US president, though, has yet to yield much. ""When you measure the results there are different questions on the Iran deal, on trade tariffs, on climate, these are areas where Macron's vision has not prevailed, at least, not for now,"" says Politico's Nicholas Vinoc ur. At home, Macron's supporters say he is leading a revolution. In a country long suspicious of change and governed by left and rightwing politics, he has exploded the political landscape, shattered the conservative and socialist parties and pushed ahead with reforms. He says the key to creating opportunity and reducing France's high unemployment is to grow the economy and attract investment. ""You can't redistribute wealth before having created it,"" said Jerome Dubus, a Paris councillor with Macron's party. ""So he has firstly chosen to encourage French economic growth before redistributing. People think he's doing it for the rich, not the poor, but in reality it's for everyone"". A tech start-up hub in Paris called Station F could be a model for Macron's vision of France. Appropriately it opened the year he was elected. You can't redistribute wealth before having created it Jerome Dubus, Paris Councillor The enormous renovated depot is home to hundreds of tech workers plugged in to the future. Alexander Bregman is CEO of Invitly.co, a social network application for business travellers. He says France is an exciting place for entrepreneurs. ""When Macron came in and Station F opened and we saw a big shift in French start-up world... and that was the reason for me to stay in France and build my company,"" Bregman said. Protests and strikes Not everyone feels at home in Macron's France, however. Many people who already struggle to make ends meet or are jobless fear things are getting worse. ""He is the 'president of the rich',"" sneered the far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon during last year's campaign. The moniker has stuck. Since March there have been street protests and strikes in France against Macron's reforms. They are being led by rail workers with public-sector workers and students. Protesters say he is destroying rights and his social policies target the most vulnerable. ""He is on the cover of the bosses' magazine Forbes; he wants to liberalise everything and cut our salaries,"" one protester said at a recent march in Paris. Trade union leaders say they will keep demonstrating until the government drops its reforms. Macron says he will not back down. The social movement could be his greatest test so far. ""If Macron fails, the remainder of his presidential term will be tarnished with a huge failure,"" IPSOS analyst Stefan Zumsteeg said. ""But if he succeeds he will be seen as someone who was capable of doing what he was elected to do, that's reform the country."" So far public approval for the strikers is falling. But Macron has not won his battle yet. His zeal to reform all parts of society and fast may create more opponents but it is unlikely to deter him. As he told a French television interviewer last year, "" I've never cared about being unpopular"".","One year into his presidency, French President Emmanuel Macron faces a challenge in strikes and protests countrywide.",2018-05-04T22:23:52Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Courageous reformer or president of the rich?

Andrew Tangel,"“This is, without any doubt, a positive catalyst for Whirlpool,” he said on an investor conference call. Nearly six months later, the company’s share price is down 15%. One factor is a separate set of tariffs on steel and aluminum, imposed by the U.S. in March and later expanded, that helped drive up Whirlpool’s raw-materials costs. Net income, even with the added benefit of a lower tax bill, was down $64 million in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. In his next call with investors, in April, Mr. Bitzer struck a cautious tone. “There continues to be uncertainty regarding potential future tariffs and trade actions,” he said. “We’ll continue to monitor, evaluate and take the right action for our business.” Put into practice, tariffs are a complex economic weapon that can ricochet through an economy in ways even proponents don’t expect. That’s what happened with washing machines, which were among the first consumer products targeted by the Trump administration. In the months since washing-machine tariffs took effect in February, LG and Samsung have pressed on with investments in the U.S., given that they now face the higher cost of shipping goods in from abroad. The overseas companies and Whirlpool have also increased hiring in the U.S. But appliance prices have risen for consumers, and there are signs of waning demand. Whirlpool had campaigned for protection from what it called unfair foreign competition. Things became more complicated as the trade conflict spread beyond its industry. “Raw-material costs have risen substantially,” Mr. Bitzer said on the April investor call, primarily blaming steel and aluminum tariffs. Most of the 200-pound weight of a washing machine is in its steel and aluminum parts. A spokeswoman at the Benton Harbor, Mich., company declined to answer more detailed questions about the tariffs’ effects, saying Whirlpool needed to remain silent before it announces second-quarter earnings in late July. She declined to make Mr. Bitzer or other executives available for comment. The administration has imposed tariffs on $92 billion of imports including washers, solar panels, steel, aluminum and a range of goods imported from China. U.S. trading partners, including the European Union, Canada, Mexico and China, retaliated in like sums. Mr. Trump has threatened to broaden tariffs to an additional $200 billion in goods sold to the U.S. from China, including thousands of product categories that would hit consumers directly, such as bicycles, vacuum cleaners and baseball gloves. He has also said he might pursue tariffs on imported cars. President Donald Trump says he is tackling rivals’ unfair practices, and some advisers say tariffs are leverage to push U.S. trading partners lower their own barriers. Most economists, meanwhile, say they do more harm than good. The White House didn’t respond to requests for comment. An official with the U.S. Trade Representative, the lead agency for the tariffs, said doing nothing about washing machine imports could have driven American manufacturers out of business, leaving thousands unemployed. Last year, Whirlpool sought protection from South Korean competition under a provision known as the safeguard law, which required the company to establish it suffered serious injury from surging imports. The law, or section 201 of the 1974 trade act, was previously invoked in 2002 when then-President George W. Bush moved to protect steelmakers. The resulting tariffs apply a 20% duty on the first 1.2 million washing machines brought into the country each year, and a 50% duty on quantities above that threshold. The barriers are expected to remain in place for at least three years. The U.S. imported 4.2 million large residential washers in 2017, for a monthly average of 350,000, according to Christopher Rogers, an analyst ﻿ at Panjiva, a firm that tracks global trade data. This year, imports have fallen to an average of 161,000 each month through April. Washer and dryer prices climbed 20% in the three months through June, the steepest rise in at least 12 years, according to Labor Department estimates. LG cited washer tariffs when it announced it was raising prices in January. Electrolux ELUXY 1.12% cited tariffs on steel, aluminum and Chinese imports but not those on washers. Whirlpool called its price increase “cost-based” due to raw-material, labor and innovation expenses. “We have repeatedly stated that this tariff is a tax on every washing machine buyer in the U.S.,” a Samsung spokesman said. “Since the tariff was implemented, U.S. consumers have paid more for their washing machines across all brands.” Only about 3.7% of the average appliance sale is profit, according to market research firm IBISWorld, leaving little room to absorb new tariffs or increased costs without raising prices. Components, such as steel, make up over half the cost of an average appliance. Labor covers an additional 10%. Further U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports could put even more upward pressure on prices than the steel and aluminum tariffs, said Dylan Miller, an appliance industry analyst for IBISWorld. Home appliances are increasingly technologically sophisticated, making them dependent on chips and electronic components, often imported from China. “It’s already a highly globalized industry,” said Mr. Miller. “Operators are going to have to worry about, ‘Oh, where do we get semiconductors, circuit boards?’ ” Prices have risen for the least-expensive washing machines, according to research by financial-data-analysis firm Thinknum for The Wall Street Journal. Whirlpool’s least-expensive model jumped from an average price of $329 in January to $429 in June. Samsung’s rose from $494 to $582, while LG’s rose from $629 to $703. Price increases at the lower end are most likely to be felt by consumers. Bill Anders, 61 years old, a retired educator in Churubusco, Ind., decided in April to use his tax refund money to replace some appliances. The price for the washer and dryer combo he preferred, manufactured by LG and sold by Sears, was about $2,478 including installation. It was so much he decided to forgo buying other appliances. “We looked at stoves and dishwashers, too, but with the money we had in hand, so to speak, we just decided to do the washer and dryer,” he said. Ryan Smith, of Smith’s Appliances outside of Kansas City, an appliance repair business, said higher prices have helped his business of keeping old machines churning. In the past, when washing machine repairs cost more than $200 people skipped repairs and bought new machines. “Now we are doing more expensive repairs such as tub bearings, gear cases and control boards, pushing $300 to $500,” he said. Sales have been underperforming other product categories, following strong sales earlier this year before the tariffs kicked in, said Phil Hannon, vice president at retailer Abt Electronics in the Chicago suburb of Glenview. “They’re not rushing out there to replace their laundry [appliances] at these pricing levels,” he said. Washer shipments, a proxy for sales, to U.S. dealers dropped 18% in May compared with the previous year, the steepest monthly decline since March 2012, according to data compiled by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, a trade group. Analysts said shipments likely dropped because dealers had stocked up on washers before prices rose. LG blamed post-tariff price increases, too, a spokesman for the manufacturer said. Home Depot Inc. said it hadn’t seen any impact from the tariffs on sales of washing machines. Some members of the Retail Industry Leaders Association reported a sales decrease in April, a spokeswoman for the trade group said. With import competition restrained, Whirlpool anticipated more business for its Clyde, Ohio, washer plant and added 200 positions to its payroll to gear up. Business there appears to have slowed in the past few months. Whirlpool paused operations at the Clyde facility for a few days each around the Memorial Day and Fourth of July holidays, according to workers, suppliers and Scott Black, the town’s mayor. Such periodic “down days” are typical when inventory builds, Mr. Black said. Workers typically take unpaid days off or vacation during such pauses. Steve Cummins, vice president at Mansfield Engineered Components Inc. in Ohio, a Whirlpool supplier whose products include counterbalances for washer-door hinges, said he has seen an uptick in demand from Whirlpool. Green Bay Packaging Inc., which supplies corrugated boxes for finished Whirlpool washers, said an initial uptick in business has faded. “Volume is down overall for the year driven by the last three months,” said Bryan Hollenbach, executive vice president at Green Bay Packaging. In January, Joe Liotine, Whirlpool’s president for North America, told the U.S. Trade Representative’s office the manufacturer could add a third shift at the Clyde factory and hire more than 1,300 workers. Whirlpool workers, contacted in Clyde in early July, said much of the factory’s production wasn’t running on all three shifts. Whirlpool also told trade regulators that tariffs would help make way for capital investments in the Clyde factory. Mr. Black, who went on a recent tour of the facility, said much of the plant was under construction, including a new museum, labs and training facilities. Workers said Whirlpool has been adding equipment in preparation for a new line of washers. Whirlpool in recent years had sought and won conventional tariffs aimed at what it called unfair dumping, or selling below cost in the U.S., by LG and Samsung. The South Korean companies, which denied they broke trade rules, avoided those trade barriers by shifting production, first to China, then to Thailand and Vietnam. Amid the continuing tariff threats, both LG and Samsung decided to build washer plants in the U.S. LG’s plant in Clarksville, Tenn., is slated to open in the fourth quarter and initially employ about 600 workers. “My mandate is to get it done as soon as possible,” said Paul Bradford, who is overseeing construction. An LG spokesman said the manufacturer began exploring a possible U.S. factory in 2010 and that the tariff threat spurred the company to speed up construction. A USTR official said the tariffs encouraged both firms to move ahead with their U.S. production plans. Samsung started producing washers in January at a retrofitted plant formerly run by Caterpillar Inc. in South Carolina. With more than 600 workers, it was churning out more than 1,000 washers a day as of this spring, said Tony Fraley, who oversaw the factory’s rapid renovation for Samsung before leaving the company. Samsung didn’t respond to a request for comment about the production rate. People familiar with the matter said Mr. Trump’s election influenced Samsung’s decision to produce in South Carolina. Samsung said it hired many laid-off former Caterpillar workers. The unemployment rate in Newberry County, the site of the plant, dropped to 2.6% in May from 3.5% in the same month a year earlier. Foster Senn, mayor of the city of Newberry, said developers are contemplating building a new hotel and subdivision. In Clyde, some employees at Whirlpool and one nearby supplier said the tariffs are working. “If not for that, Whirlpool wouldn’t have been able to hire,” said Matthew Morton, 42, who works for a supplier and has a son who works at the washer factory. Some Whirlpool workers said recent production stoppages have fueled questions about the outlook. “Everything is now thrown back into a flux,” said Mr. Black, the mayor, himself a former Whirlpool employee. His wife, children and other relatives work at the plant. “People’s anxiety level is higher because nobody knows what’s going on.” Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com","Trade barriers can ricochet through an economy in ways even proponents don’t expect, as shown by washers, among the first consumer products targeted by the Trump administration.

Ben Fox Rubin,"The world's largest tech show has become center stage for the digital assistant wars.
Amazon Alexa was the belle of the CES ball two years ago when the e-commerce giant unveiled a long list of product integrations that included Ford vehicles and Whirlpool appliances. Not to be overshadowed, Google the following year constructed a large, eye-catching stage and announced four new Google Assistant-powered smart displays.
Which brings us to CES 2019, kicking off next week. There, Amazon and Google are expected to make big splashes designed to show the rest of the tech industry that they -- not the other guy -- have the best platform for operating our smart homes, connected cars and voice-powered offices. Making their cases will be especially important at CES, since the show has become a who's who for the smart home and automotive industries -- two major growth areas for voice assistants.
But while both have extended the reach and influence of voice computing, both also need to broaden their messages and showcase their voice assistants' capabilities. That work could persuade more consumers that they need smart speakers as much as they need smartphones. 
Currently, 32 percent of Americans own a smart speaker while 77 percent have smartphones, according to Adobe and Pew Research, showing there's much more room for voice to grow. Smart speaker adoption has been growing at a healthy clip, but drawing in new customers may get harder, with increased consumer concern about data privacy and a regular trickle of negative anecdotes about Alexa malfunctioning. Also, Adobe reported the No. 1 reason people don't own a smart speaker is because they feel they just don't have a use for one.
""If the industry can convince those that do not own a smart speaker to get one, we believe the effects can be exponential,"" in sparking new uses in gaming, shopping and search, Adobe Analytics' Heidi Besik wrote last month.
Here's what to expect from the leading voice-assistant players at CES this year:
Amazon Alexa: The market leader
The online retailing kingpin will likely keep up its strategy of announcing lots of new Alexa partnerships to demonstrate its market dominance and highlight the versatility of its voice assistant.
Amazon may also use its now sprawling devices portfolio to help retain its lead. That could mean using CES to unveil new integrations or features for its Fire TV streaming devices, Amazon Key in-home delivery service or Ring home-security gadgets. But don't expect a long list of new Amazon-branded devices. The company introduced many Alexa-powered devices in September at its own Seattle launch event. 
At CES, Amazon is all about unveiling new partnerships, like this one with Toyota last year.
Ben Fox Rubin/CNET
And while Amazon's playbook of using large volume of announcements to show voice supremacy has worked well in the past, the company now faces a lot more competition. In mid-2017, Amazon controlled just over 70 percent of the US smart speaker market, eMarketer reported. The research firm last month predicted that number will drop to 63 percent in 2019 as competitors catch up. The Google Home speaker, for instance, should reach 31 percent; other speakers, including the Apple HomePod and Sonos One, will account for 12 percent. (Some consumers use multiple brands, accounting for a total that's higher than 100 percent.)
It's why Amazon needs the CES spotlight focused on Alexa and not on some rival voice assistant.
Google Assistant: The fast-following No. 2
One of the four smart displays Google unveiled with its partners at CES last year.
Josh Miller/CNET
If any company can make Amazon nervous about its future in voice, it's Google.
The search giant introduced its first smart speaker in late 2016, two years after Amazon unveiled the Echo, but has quickly captured almost a third of the US smart speaker market. Google has also copied some of Amazon's best ideas -- coming out with a cheap, pint-size speaker called the Google Home Mini to rival the Echo Dot, and introducing its own smart displays to compete against the Echo Show.
Now Google is signaling big plans for CES 2019, saying it'll triple the size of its presence from last year. The company may introduce more partnerships as well as smart-home features from its Nest team to help keep pace with Amazon.
But while Google has made big strides, it's unlikely to dethrone Alexa in the next few years.
Samsung Bixby: A lot of potential
Samsung, the world's biggest smartphone maker, has been working its way into voice via its Bixby assistant. It started by bringing Bixby to its Galaxy S8 in 2017, and even created a dedicated Bixby button on the side of the phone. It also unveiled a smart speaker in August, called the Galaxy Home, which hasn't gone on sale yet. In late 2017, the company said it would start adding Bixby into its refrigerators and smart TVs.
Samsung has been talking up its plans to make Bixby a more important piece of its future. But so far, it's well behind Amazon and Google in voice assistant smart-home devices, features and partnerships. It may even be too late to catch up.
The company is typically a big player at CES, so it may use the show to keep pushing awareness of Bixby. It'll be a challenge to stand out, though, against the two top dogs.
The rest of the pack: A scramble for relevance
Apple's Siri pioneered voice computing on phones and remains a notable player in the market. But Siri has fallen far behind the competition, and Apple's HomePod remains an also-ran in smart speakers as the company focuses on iPhones, its main profit driver. In addition, Apple rarely has a public presence at CES, preferring to host its own events. All these factors point to Siri likely being irrelevant at the upcoming show.
Microsoft's presence at CES in recent years has focused mostly on supporting its PC partners' new devices, so it's doubtful to reveal a big Cortana-related announcement at the show. Although an early player in voice computing, the software giant hasn't pushed Cortana development -- keeping its voice assistant a minor player.
Facebook may make some noise this year, using CES to promote its Alexa-powered Portal smart display. 
Then there's IBM. Given that CEO Ginni Rometty has a coveted CES keynote speaker spot this year, we may hear news about Watson, though it will likely be focused more on businesses rather than consumers.
For any of these companies hoping to hold its own at CES -- and many don't even want to play that game -- coming out from under Amazon and Google's massive shadows won't be easy.

Mark Wilson,"While most of us were mainlining eggnog over the holiday break, Essential, another supposed “iPhone killer,” bit the dust. The startup, which raised $300 million in funding and was helmed by Android founder Andy Rubin (until he took a leave of absence following revelations about an improper behavior probe during his time at Google), will no longer make its $500 smartphone.Despite Essential’s untimely end, there is evidence that the market for “artisan” phones is growing–but crucially, the most successful of these phones aren’t trying to compete with Google or Apple at all. They’re “dumbphones.” Rather than going blow-for-blow with major smartphone makers, the value proposition is in the promise of less functionality. Punkt. Palm Phone. The rereleased Nokia 3310. These manufacturers seem to have carved out a small but sustainable niche as smartphone sales decline.
But the truth is that I don’t want to have to buy a dumbphone. The single feature I want most is a smartphone with a dumbphone mode. 
Essential Phone prototypes. [Photo: Essential Products]
What would dumbphone mode do? Simple. It would turn your smartphone into a device for calls and texts. That’s it. Other apps would simply disappear from your screen so as not to tempt you to tap. And all that spyable data lurking deep in the OS–like GPS tracking–would be deactivated. As a result, you’d get the full dumphone experience without carrying another phone around.
The reissued Nokia 3310. [Photo: Nokia]
I know, dumbphone mode probably sounds kind of stupid. But compared to the hazards of smartphones, it starts to make sense. Silicon Valley designed for every possible edge case, outfitting every phone with an armada of sensors and processors to tackle any problem at any moment. Need to find good sushi down the block? Better consult with satellites in outer space first! However, that digital Swiss army knife in our pockets comes with sorts of consequences: It diverts our attention from the world around us (making us measurably less happy), and it gives corporations unprecedented access to our private lives. Just pulling your phone from your pocket to text a loved one a few emoji requires immense mental fortitude, lest you get sucked down into the whirlpool of apps, ad trackers, and the psychic burden of what hundreds of other people think of your photo of dinner.
Most of us simply don’t have the luxury of giving up our smartphones. We need Slack, Gmail, and numerous social media platforms just to keep up with our day. Even off the clock, there are always those moments when we need directions somewhere or need an app to carry out a crucial real-world task. Living without a smartphone just doesn’t work, and dumbphones can’t suddenly turn smart when you need them to. 
So the dumbphone turns into an extra phone, rather than a replacement phone. You can’t even get the Palm Phone on its own contract through Verizon–it’s a “companion phone” to your smartphone.
The new Palm. [Photo: Palm]
Meanwhile, the only way you can actually use your phone and be off the grid is by putting it into airplane mode–turning off the radios that connect it to cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, which, in turn, shuts off all the data, too. This solution is equivalent to cutting the power to your whole house just to turn off the living room lights. Apple and Google have bothcreated tools to track and limit phone use, but their solutions attempt to change your behavior more than the phone’s capabilities. It’s a bitter irony: The only safe way to use your smartphone is to render it unusable. That just doesn’t make sense.
Which brings me to dumphone mode. I’ll capitalize it for extra trademarkability: Dumbphone ModeTM! With apologies to Essential’s talented design team, no one needs an iPhone or Galaxy alternative, no matter how beautiful or clever its industrial design may be. And nobody can survive with an actual dumphone unless they’re growing all their own food on some solar-powered farm in Montana.
But dumbing down your smartphone, on demand, could do a lot to bring back the intimacy that phones once excelled at providing–the ability to communicate with friends and loved ones one-on-one, without the rest of the world watching and vying for our attention.","I don’t want to trade in my smartphone for a dumb one, but I do want the benefits.

Chris DeVille,"Philadelphia-based artists Simon Martinez and Zane Shields have a weird and wild musical project together called Pulgas. With Martinez on guitar and vocals and Shields handling drums, they conjure a “cosmogenetic whirlpool” (per their official bio) of musty jazz and funk, hyperactive electronic beats, and lo-fi indie balladry. Their songs tend to morph through a few shapes, held together more by mood than any structural template. Or as their Bandcamp explains it, “Pulgas is undeniable garbage wizardry.” “That’s A Big Stain,” the opener from their imminent More Like Us EP, drops you right into their zonked headspace. Right away we hear a tumble of drum-n-bass breakbeats, tweaked music box sounds, and an assortment of guitar and keyboard swells like half-forgotten memories. Martinez’s low, measured vocals navigates through the chaos toward brief moments of peace.

Evan Selleck,"The Apple Watch app makes it easy to check up on apps, and, in some cases, get things done without requiring your phone. Whirlpool, a company that has a wide range of appliances, has just announced that it will let Apple Watch owners control more than 20 different appliances with just an app on the wearable. CNET has a quick write-up of what Whirlpool appliance owners can expect in the near future, indicating that with a smart oven and an Apple Watch, owners can use the app to change the oven’s settings while it’s being used, and check the temperature make sure everything is as it should be. Meanwhile, owners of a supported smart dryer can see if a cycle as started, or, if it has, see how much time is left on a running cycle. The Apple Watch app will let owners of smart washing machines change the cycle while the appliance is running. The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is going on right now, and Whirlpool is showing off how the app works. The original report indicates that this is the first time a manufacturer of home appliances has announced an Apple Watch of this nature, so it will be interesting to see if this is the first of many to come. This sort of app, where Apple Watch owners can keep tabs on their smart appliances, and even change cycles or temperatures or operations, has been a long time coming to say the least. It’s a little surprising it took this long. Now that Whirlpool has started the initiative, though, we could see other companies start to offer a similar app on the smartwatch.

"newsfeedback@fool.com (Keith Noonan, Timothy Green, and Demitrios Kalogeropoulos)","October was a tumultuous month for the investing world, with steep sell-offs wiping out much of the market's gains on the year and analysts weighing in with takes on what the future might hold. There's no telling exactly what the broader market will do in the short term, but regardless of whether the contraction proves to be short-lived or the start of a more prolonged correction, there are still great companies trading at substantial discounts relative to their fundamentals and potential. Investors who identify these leading, attractively valued businesses and hold for the long term have the chance to record huge returns despite market volatility. With that in mind, we put together a panel of three Motley Fool contributors and asked each to profile a stock that looks like a steal at current prices. Read on to see why they think Baidu ( NASDAQ:BIDU ), Carnival ( NYSE:CCL ), and Whirlpool ( NYSE:WHR ) offer great bang for your buck. Image source: Getty Images. This Chinese search giant is a cheap AI play Keith Noonan (Baidu): With escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and stocks posting steep sell-offs, investing in the Chinese tech sector might not be a popular move at the moment, but Baidu is looking very cheap. Shares trade at just 19.5 times this year's expected earnings -- a valuation that looks enticing when placed in the context of the business's strong earnings growth, dominant position in China's search market, and huge opportunities thanks to burgeoning tech trends. The potential for regulations imposed by the Chinese government to slow the company's growth engine is a risk that shouldn't be ignored, but Baidu's potential to benefit from its close relationship with the government shouldn't be ignored either. The country has a keen interest in establishing a leadership position in artificial intelligence (AI) and has made Baidu one of its key corporate partners -- funding some of the company's AI research and adding to its already vast trove of valuable data. China has also chosen the search giant's Apollo operating system as the country's official platform for self-driving vehicles, suggesting that Baidu will benefit from providing the foundation for an emerging app ecosystem and supporting the development of connected-city technologies. The tech industry is notorious for its sometimes unpredictable twists and turns, and investing in Chinese companies sometimes adds extra layers of uncertainty. Baidu might hit some bumps in the road, but there's a good chance that shareholders will look back at its current stock price five years or a decade from now and view it as absurdly cheap. Cruising speed Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Carnival): Thanks to a double-digit percentage decline so far this year, investors can now purchase shares of Carnival at an unusually low valuation. In fact, at 12 times expected earnings, compared to 23 for the broader market, the cruise vacation giant's P/E ratio is the lowest it has been since early 2012. That dire valuation conflicts with recent operating results, which have been solid. Net revenue yields, a core industry growth metric, have beat expectations in each of the last three quarters. And Carnival has been finding room to raise ticket prices while also benefiting from increased onboard spending by guests. Put those positive trends together and it's clear why the company is setting new quarterly sales and earnings records. In late September, executives predicted a growth slowdown over the next few quarters, which has added to Wall Street worries that the good times may be ending. But management believes there's no risk to their bullish long-term outlook, which relies on favorable demographics and increasing efficiencies to power market-beating profits. CEO Arnold Donald and his team have been backing up those words with action by aggressively buying back Carnival's stock as its price has dropped. Investors who agree with their long-term vision might want to consider following the company's lead and building up a position in the industry leader. Dividends should withstand tariff pain Tim Green (Whirlpool): Shares of appliance maker Whirlpool have tumbled over the past year, down about 38% from their 52-week high. Tariffs have pushed up the cost of raw materials like steel, and price increases to offset those higher costs have knocked down demand. The bottom line is holding up so far -- third-quarter adjusted earnings per share jumped nearly 19% year over year. But those earnings will almost certainly take a hit if a prolonged trade war leads to a recession. Whirlpool stock looks very cheap. The company expects to produce adjusted earnings per share between $14.50 and $14.80 this year, which puts the price-to-earnings ratio at a lowly 8. The stock probably isn't quite as cheap as it looks -- the appliance business is cyclical, depending on the strength of the economy, new home construction, and remodeling activity. But that single-digit PE ratio gives investors a margin of safety if earnings take a tumble. On top of a pessimistic valuation, Whirlpool sports a solid dividend. The stock pays out $1.15 per share each quarter, good for a dividend yield of about 4%. The payout ratio isn't all that high, just over 30% of the company's adjusted earnings guidance, so it should be safe under a wide range of scenarios. Whirlpool stock is cheap for a reason, but I think the market has taken it a little too far. The stock has bounced a bit off its 52-week low, but it's still a good time to add this high-yield value stock to your portfolio.",These three discounted stocks have the potential to be big winners.,2018-11-10T15:15:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fool.com'}",3 Stocks That Are Absurdly Cheap Right Now,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/10/3-stocks-that-are-absurdly-cheap-right-now.aspx,https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F495894%2Fgettyimages-514416224.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize,,Fool.com,whirlpool,1

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
Evolutionarily we were not meant to exist in isolation. Inside, each of us has an innate fear of not being accepted or having our contribution shunned by the community we feel the strongest resonance to serving. 
As business owners and entrepreneurs, the sting of rejection can pierce like a dagger to the heart. It can be extremely hard not to take rejection personally. It’s our ideas, our blood and our sweat and tears that are being shown the exit.
The success of any business comes not with necessarily being the biggest, the best or the fastest. It comes from being the most innovative and adaptive. We often forget the underlying truth that rejection experiences have given birth to cutting-edge enterprises. In many cases, rejections have been the genesis of brilliant solutions that would otherwise have been unfathomable were it not for our mental anguish.
When you learn to embrace and practice certain strategies, you’ll no longer fear or try to avoid rejection. You may actually look forward to it.
1.) Acknowledge and prepare for rejection.
Most of us become angry when, despite putting in eighty-percent of the groundwork, our customer then decides to work with our nemesis. Overcoming rejection actually occurs from accepting the emotions that come with it. It is OK to feel angry and frustrated. The emotional and mental weight you feel is just as valid as any physical pain. In the long run, it’s more appropriate and healthy -- emotionally, mentally and physically -- that you allow yourself to feel that.
Always have a rejection-processing protocol in place. Debrief with personal and professional support people who can empathize and appreciate your experiences without passing judgment, criticizing or looking to give you immediate advice. Primary acknowledgment of its emotional and mental impact upon on you is essential.

Over time, examine the suite of likely reactions you have when rejection opportunities bare their unattractive heads. Know this about yourself. Being able to predict your own responses as well as build in the foresight that rejection is possible can also greatly lessen the blow. You will feel a greater sense of control knowing what may lie ahead and knowing you’ve got processes in place to handle it.
2.) Find the blessings in every rejection experience.
There will always be customers that do not like us, our service or our product. Whilst this prods us to do comparison reviews of systems, processes, products and service quality, put that aside for a moment. We often can’t see it at the time, but in many cases, rejections are blessings in disguise.
Do you want customers who wish to discuss minute details forever and a day, only to decide they want to start from the beginning again just as you were about to sign-off on the contract? Do you want to be treated like a commodity on-call 24/7, expected to make ‘urgent’ changes to a blueprint during Sunday evening quality time with your family?
You don’t want these customers. Nobody does. Refer and direct those customers to your competitors who are open to being treated this way -- you are not.
In this respect, understand your competitors’ businesses actually complement your own. Even if you provide almost the exact same service as your neighbor, remember that you are the brand and that no other individual can copy you or your reasons for being in business. Customers are smart. You might also unforeseeably impress and surprise those very customers who are treating you unprofessionally.

You can put on your match-making hat and referred those clients to a business which better fit their needs? Don’t become their case manager, but what if you then followed up to find out if such a customer was happy? They certainly would not forget the lengths you went to. Such service is rare. Riding the positive wave of your satisfaction from doing this will be far better than sulking and bidding them good riddance under your breath.
3.) After licking your wounds, feed your growth mindset.
Steve Jobs was rejected and sacked from his own company, Apple, in 1985. After purchasing Pixar Animation Studios from Lucasfilm in 1986, he went on to generate his first billion dollars. Today, Pixar is the most successful animation studio of its kind. Not a bad comeback, some might say.
The whirlpool of unsavory emotions we experience in rejection is often a great catalyst for stretching our minds laterally to dimensions never visited before. You might initially doubt yourself, question your competency and your self-worth but after you have weathered the storm, activate your growth mindset and start asking questions.
What can I do differently? What have I discovered about myself? What changes can I make in my business? Could I have handled the closing conversation better? What will I do differently next time? What else is possible?
Never stop at licking your wounds only to return to the status quo. Never.

Post-rejection always builds in a strategic review not just as an individual but with a relevant business coach or consultant. Just like Steve Jobs, you could be at the cusp of a discovery that will change your business and your life forever.
4.) Transform your definition of rejection.
We often ascribe rejection to something wrong with us. Start-ups and solopreneurs are particularly vulnerable to thinking rejection means they are not good enough. Even though this might resonate with you, it doesn’t mean your thinking is accurate.
Invite yourself to consider, Are my deductions about myself actually true or is it the pain speaking? Does it hurt so much because I wanted so badly to be accepted and validated? Is my service or product simply not substandard but simply not the best fit for that customer?
Consciously practice thinking more about the positive consequences of your being rejected. What opportunities can you now see that have been hiding behind the clouds of the status quo? Rejection can, in fact, be a glorious unveiling of new possibilities.",Redefining the experience and profiting by it can turn rejection into the fuel for success.,2019-01-03T13:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",4 Ways to Handle and Overcome Your Fear of Rejection,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324719,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20190102173817-GettyImages-913812208.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,whirlpool,1
newsfeedback@fool.com (Sean Williams),"The past two months have been a wake-up call to investors that the stock market doesn't go straight up. Even though the market has historically gained 7% a year, inclusive of dividend reinvestment and when adjusted for inflation, it doesn't mean there aren't rough patches from time to time. Since 1987, there have been 23 instances where the broad-based S&amp;P 500 has dipped by at least 5%, according to Yardeni Research, and since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 36 corrections, which are defined as a decline of 10% or more from a recent high. In February, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 both fell into correction territory for the first time in two years, with losses of just over 10% since hitting an all-time high in January. Image source: Getty Images. But the good news is that each and every one of these corrections (save for the current one) has eventually been erased by bull market rallies. Patient long-term investors are almost always rewarded, which means any correction is usually a great time to go shopping for new stocks. Though I haven't added any new positions to my portfolio recently, I do have four companies high on my watchlist that could soon find themselves squarely in my portfolio should this correction persist. 1. Celgene If I had to pick my top watchlist stock, it would be biotech blue-chip Celgene ( NASDAQ:CELG ). Celgene's stock has been hammered since it lowered its 2020 outlook in October, and more recently after the company announced embarrassing insufficiencies with its new drug application for ozanimod, an experimental next-generation multiple sclerosis drug that's being counted on by the company and shareholders to generate billions in annual sales. The need for this additional information for its filing will delay ozanimod's projected launch date. Lastly, sales growth of anti-inflammatory pill Otezla have been underwhelming in recent quarters. That's the bad news; now here's the good news. First, Celgene announced a settlement with generic Revlimid manufacturers in December 2015 that'll keep a flood of generic Revlimid off pharmacy shelves until the end of January 2026. That means Revlimid will remain a cash cow for Celgene, and with its increasing demand and duration of use, it has a real shot of one day becoming the best-selling drug in the world, based on annual sales. Image source: Getty Images. Secondly, ozanimod, Otezla, Pomalyst, and Abraxane all have sustainable blockbuster potential and the ability to expand their label indications, along with Revlimid. The company's recently announced acquisition of Juno Therapeutics will also bolster its cancer pipeline by adding unique CAR-T therapies to the mix. Sales growth is far less of a concern than investors realize. And finally, look at the valuation. Celgene is valued at roughly 7.3 times its projected 2020 earnings per share, despite an expected revenue growth rate of roughly 15% per year. That's dirt cheap, and it certainly has my full attention. 2. Facebook Another down-on-its-luck stock of late that's rising through the ranks of my personal watchlist is social media kingpin Facebook ( NASDAQ:FB ). Shares have nosedived in recent days following news that Cambridge Analytica mined data from up to 50 million Facebook users and employed that information to help the Trump campaign better target ads at users in 2016. It's yet another in a series of PR scandals that seem to rock the social media landscape with some frequency. But here's the thing about issues like this: They're easily forgotten. This isn't to say that a small handful of Facebook users won't leave the platform, or that users won't tighten up their security settings in an attempt to prevent data-mining firms from using their preferences as a means to target advertisements at them in the future. However, it does mean that this will likely blow over in relatively quick fashion and lead to few, if any, long-term sales and profit repercussions for Facebook. Image source: Facebook. The reality here is that Facebook has just touched the tip of the iceberg with regard to mining its social platforms for profitable avenues. Its introduction of ads to Messenger, along with its big ad push with Instagram beginning in 2015, is just a taste of what Facebook can do to boost sales. It hasn't even really begun to monetize Messenger or WhatsApp as of yet, despite the fact that it has ownership of four of the seven most popular social media sites. It also has deep-enough pockets to spend big on video, which remains a means to build regular viewership and compete directly with YouTube. What's notable is that Facebook is cheaper now than it's just about ever been. At less than 16 times 2020 earnings per share and a sales growth rate that could average between 15% and 30% per year through 2021, any sizable dip in the stock from here could be a buying opportunity. 3. Whirlpool Next, I've really got my eyes on Whirlpool ( NYSE:WHR ). That's right, boring old appliance giant Whirlpool, which has been struggling in recent months as a result of a slightly weaker-than-expected profit outlook for 2018, weaker sales in Asia and its prime North American market in 2017, and rising interest rates domestically. Let's not forget that brand-name appliances aren't necessarily cheap, meaning it's becoming more expensive for consumers to finance these purchases. Yet there are a number of reasons to be excited about Whirlpool over the long run. Namely, it does a really good job of creating shareholder value and rewarding long-term investors. It repurchased a record $1.1 billion worth of common stock in 2017, and plans to continue buying back its own stock in 2018. Management also made cost-cutting initiatives a priority this year, which should boost margins while sales flatten out in the interim. And we can't forget that Whirlpool pays a respectable $4.40 a year in dividends, which works out to a market-topping 2.8% yield. Image source: Whirlpool. Whirlpool also has its international expansion working in its favor. This is a numbers games for the company, and historically the global economy is growing far more often than it's contracting, which bodes well for the long run. The company's push into Asia, as well as economic stabilization throughout much of Europe, should help diversify its revenue stream in the years to come. Like the companies mentioned above, Whirlpool happens to be very attractive from a fundamental perspective. By 2020, it's expected to generate $19.59 in EPS, placing it at just eight times EPS based on its current price. Buy, rinse, repeat. That's a recipe for success when it comes to Whirlpool. 4. Alliance Resource Partners Last but not least, coal producer Alliance Resource Partners ( NASDAQ:ARLP ) is looking mighty intriguing. And, yes, I did just say ""coal producer."" There probably hasn't been a more depressing industry in recent years than that of coal production, which has suffered from falling prices as a result of oversupply, growing access to alternative energy sources like natural gas, wind, and solar, and high levels of debt. But these aren't major concerns for Alliance Resource Partners. You see, Alliance Resource Partners is a conservatively run limited partnership. It ended its most recent quarter with $574 million in total debt and a debt to equity of 50%, which is substantially lower than its peers'. In fact, over the trailing-12-month period, the company has generated $556 million in operating cash flow, so its debt levels aren't a big concern. It even has the flexibility to make acquisitions if the price is right, based on the current health of its balance sheet. Image source: Getty Images. What also makes Alliance Resource different is its focus on securing production commitments well in advance. As of the company's full-year 2017 report, released in late January, it forecast 39.5 million to 40.5 million metric tons of sales volume for 2018. However, it has 33.7 million metric tons in secured price and volume commitments already for 2018, as well as 11.6 million tons in 2019, 7.6 million tons in 2020, and 1.3 million tons in 2021. Thinking ahead means less exposure to the wholesale market and much better cash flow predictability. With coal still expected to produce north of 30% of this country's electricity, Alliance Resource and its sustainable 11% dividend yield look like a genuine opportunity for contrarian investors. And, if that's not enticing enough, it's currently valued at less than six times this year's estimated cash flow per share. That's cheap.",These valuations may be too appealing to pass up.,2018-03-23T14:21:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fool.com'}",4 Top Stocks on My Buy Radar During This Correction,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/03/23/4-top-stocks-on-my-buy-radar-during-this-correctio.aspx,https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F476950%2Fbuy-low-sell-high-stock-market-chart-investing-retirement-getty.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize,,Fool.com,whirlpool,1
