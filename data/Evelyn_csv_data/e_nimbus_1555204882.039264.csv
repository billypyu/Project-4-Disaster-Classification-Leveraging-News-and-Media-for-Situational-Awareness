John Biggs,"A new drone from the NIMBUS group at the University of Nebraska can fall out of a plane, parachute down, fly to a certain place, dig a hole, hide sensors inside it, and then fly away like some crazy wasp. Robots are weird.
The goal of the project is to allow drones to place sensors in distant and hostile environments. The system starts on a plane or helicopter which ejects the entire thing inside of a cylindrical canister. The canister falls for a while then slows down with a parachute. Once it’s close enough to the ground it pops out, lands, and drills a massive hole with a screw drill, and leaves the heavy parts to fly home.
Drones can only fly for so long while carrying heavy gear so this ensures that the drone can get there without using battery and escape without running down to empty.
“Battery powered drones have very short flight times, especially when flying with a heavy load, which we are since we have our digging apparatus and sensor system. So to get to distant locations, we need to hitch a ride on another vehicle,” said NIMBUS co-director Carrick Detweiler to Spectrum. “This allows it to save energy for return trips. In this video we used a much larger gas powered UAS with multiple hours of flight time, but our same system could be deployed from manned aircraft or other systems.”
The drone can even sense if the ground is too hard for digging and choose another spot, allowing for quite a bit of flexibility. Given that these things can land silently in far off locations you can imagine some interesting military uses for this technology. I’m sure it will be fine for us humans, though. I mean what could go wrong with a robot that can hide things underground in distant, unpopulated places and escape undetected?","A new drone from the NIMBUS group at the University of Nebraska can fall out of a plane, parachute down, fly to a certain place, dig a hole, hide sensors inside it, and then fly away like some crazy wasp.

Kris Naudus,"The best controller for a game is usually the one that came with its original console, but that's not always possible when it comes to classic releases on current systems. Instead of making do with your modern gamepad, it's worth taking a look at 8Bitdo's retro-styled controllers. They capture the original style and feel of old Nintendo controllers while being compatible with iOS, Android, Windows, Mac and even the Switch. If you're looking for near-exact copies of the original pads, there's the N30 and SN30, with the 2.4G version of the latter working wirelessly with your SNES Classic. But gamers who don't want to give up modern innovations like thumbsticks will find the Pro versions of these controllers more to their liking. The N30 Pro's biggest flaw is a series of shoulder buttons that The Verge found ""cramped and uncomfortable,"" but the upcoming SN30 Pro looks to give your adult-size fingers just a bit more room to relax. *The F30 and F30 Pro are the Famicom-styled versions of the N30 and N30 Pro. Console-quality game controllers for Android devices are hard to find and, outside of the Xbox controllers, your options for Windows gamepads aren't particularly great either. The SteelSeries Stratus XL hits a sweet spot for both systems by offering a solid build and top-notch ergonomics at a reasonable price. The buttons are deep and the thumbsticks are a bit stiff, meaning some users might find the XL a bit of a struggle in shooters. But Destructoid says the D-pad is ""miles ahead of an Xbox pad,"" with fantastic diagonals ideal for fighting games. With exclusives like Thatgamecompany's Sky coming to Apple TV, games on the Apple TV are going to get way more serious, and you're definitely going to want something better than the Siri remote to play them with. The Nimbus borrows from the time-tested designs of the Xbox and PlayStation controllers but doesn't skimp on vital details: The D-pad is decent, and the thumbsticks are grippy and durable, with MakeUseOf noting that they ask for ""the perfect amount of pressure to manipulate."" Even if you haven't invested in an Apple TV, you can still enjoy the Nimbus with your iPhone or iPad, though, if using the latter, you might want to invest in a Nyko Smart Clip to hold on to your handset.","If you're picking up a game console like the Xbox One X or PlayStation 4 Pro this holiday season, congratulations: You already have a great controller for your new system.

Nick Douglas,"Listen to me, a professional writer: School and college teach you bad writing habits. One of those bad habits is padding out your work to reach a minimum page count. Anything you do to “cheat” at your page count, by making less text look like more, is an act of noble rebellion. And the new font Times Newer Roman is an excellent, hard-to-detect tool for padding. Digital agency MSCHF meticulously designed Times Newer Roman to take up more space without looking obviously different from Times New Roman. So if you hand in a paper with this typeface, it will look just like all the other papers, and your teacher or professor is very unlikely to notice anything. That’s a huge advantage over other padding techniques like extra-wide spacing or a bigger type size, which become obvious when placed next to properly formatted text. MSCHF designed the font by tweaking the free font Nimbus Roman No. 9, which looks extremely similar to Times New Roman. MSCHF’s designers carefully widened the letters and enlarged punctuation to make the text slightly wider. In their words, they “widened specific letters along the x-axis where it’s least noticeable while maintaining stroke width and harmonious curve modeling.” The differences are so subtle that you can look at the same text in the two fonts, see that one takes up more space, and still not figure out how. You can use this on any paper that you print or export into PDF. But it won’t work if you’re handing in a Word doc, as Word won’t embed the font unless the recipient has already installed that font on their computer. And you probably shouldn’t hatch an elaborate plan to secretly install fonts on your professor’s computer. At that point you should probably just tack on a few paragraphs of bullshit. There are many agencies that try to create “viral” internet projects, but MSCHF is one of the few that makes actually useful and funny tools. Michelle Woo previously covered MSCHF’s Tabagotchi Chrome extension, built to advertise the office-share company Breather. They also made an app for tracking morning boners, and an awkward conversation generator for the Amazon Echo. Times Newer Roman isn’t made for any sponsor; the only things it’s advertising are MSCHF itself, and the inanity of page minimums.

Tom Westrick,"Here's how to take a screenshot on your Chromebook! Sometimes, you just need to show someone else the thing that's on your screen. In this case, taking a screenshot is the easiest thing to do. Here's how to take a screenshot on a Chromebook ! Use the keyboard The window switch key on a Chromebook. Every Chromebook has a keyboard, and taking a screenshot with the keyboard can be done in a couple ways. To capture your entire screen, hit Ctrl + window switch key. To capture only part of the screen, hit Ctrl + Shift + window switch key, then click and drag your cursor to select the area you'd like to capture. Note: If you're using an external keyboard, the combinations will be Ctrl + F5 and Ctrl + Shift + F5, respectively. Use the side buttons If you're using your Chromebook in tablet mode, it's pretty inconvenient to swing the keyboard back around just to take a screenshot. Fortunately, there's an easier way: just like on an Android phone, you can press power + volume down to take a screenshot. This only works to capture your entire screen, so if you need a cropped section, you'll still need to use the keyboard. Keep in mind that the orientation of the volume buttons don't change with the orientation of your screen, so you'll need to remember which side is volume down. Use an extension While the built-in methods above will work for most people, some users may need a bit more power. In this case, an extension like Nimbus Screenshot &amp; Screen Video Recorder may be worth checking out. As the name implies, Nimbus lets you do a simple screenshot, but also includes the ability to record a video of your screen or delay the capture if you need to screenshot a particular menu. Download: Nimbus Screenshot &amp; Screen Video Recorder in the Chrome Web Store (free) Be sure to back it up By default, your screenshots will be locally saved to the Downloads folder on your Chromebook. In there, you can open the screenshot to crop it, add a filter, and access other basic editing options. If you want to back the screenshot up permanently, you can upload it to Google Photos or just back it up to Google Drive.","Here's how to take a screenshot on your Chromebook!

Jerry Hildenbrand,"Your Chromebook is a safe, inexpensive, and simple portal to the internet but it can do so much more. Whether you want to get productive, have a little fun, or keep in touch you'll find an app to help do it in the Chrome Web Store. Here's the short — and ever-changing — list of ones we think you have to try. Polarr Photo Editor One area where Chromebooks have traditionally been lacking is media creation tools. Photoshop for Chrome is a real thing, but it requires you to have an Adobe education license for Creative Cloud and live in North America. If you meet these qualifications you should definitely have a look, but for the rest of us, there is Polarr Photo Editor. Polarr is beautifully done, filled with features and is extremely lightweight. It's an offline app so you can work without an internet connection and it's the best way to edit photographs on your Chromebook. Whether you need to turn RAW files into great photos or just touch up something before you share it on Facebook, Polarr Photo Editor can handle the job. See at the Chrome Web Store Skype We're cheating a little bit here, but access to Skype is important enough to allow it. Skype on the web now supports text chat and phones calls using standard internet communication protocols — that means it works on your Chromebook. There are many different communication apps available — including Google's own Hangouts — but for many Skype is the de facto standard. Using your Skype account and Microsoft's official website, all you need to do is log and start Skyping. For those who want it, there are also several launchers at the Chrome Web Store that let you launch the Skype site in its own window through an icon, but we think a bookmark is just as good. Skype Online Any.do Any.do is one of the best ways to stay organized. It's a task manager, reminder list, calendar, and organizer all in one and it syncs across all your devices. It's also quite the looker! Using the Any.do app for Chrome gives you the same tools and features as the client for your phone (Android and iOS) does plus the ability to drag and drop attachments, notes, and tasks using your Chromebook's trackpad. Any.do is scalable and great for keeping track of a few reminders or as a complete organization tool for your entire team. See at the Chrome Web Store One Tab The browser on your Chromebook is really great. One of the best features is opening windows in a separate and sandboxed tab. But too many tabs make finding one tough, and enough of them can slow things down. One Tab has your back! One Tab puts a live link to every tab, or some tabs that you choose and puts them into one tab. You can go back and click any of the links to return and the tab survives when you close the browser or reboot your Chromebook. If you always end up with a slew of tabs open and can't find the one you need, give One Tab a try. See at the Chrome Web Store Nimbus You can take a screenshot on your Chromebook without any extra apps, but you might want to have a look at Nimbus if you need to do it more than once in a blue moon. Nimbus lets you capture all or part of your screen, but it's also able to capture full web pages. You know how difficult that can be without the right software if you've never tried. On top of that you can create and edit screencast videos with Nimbus right on your Chromebook and while offline. Nimbus is free and great at what it does. See at the Chrome Web Store Mighty Text If you're still waiting for Android apps on your Chromebook, or you just don't want to install everything from Google Play, Mighty Text is a great way to get all your notifications. Don't let the name fool you. Might Text is awesome and lets you read, reply and send SMS messages using your regular phone number. But it can also forward any notification from your phone right to your Chromebook screen. Folks who use an app like this will tell you how cool this is, and once you try it you'll be doing the same. It's one of those apps you'll wish you had tried earlier. See at the Chrome Web Store Your favorite apps? What are your favorite Chrome apps? Let us know in the comments below!

Abhimanyu Ghoshal,"It hasn’t even been a month since Samsung unveiled the world’s largest capacity SSD at 30TB, and it’s already been ousted from the top spot by Nimbus Data, a flash memory hardware company from Irvine, California. The company’s new pocket-sized ExaDrive SSD can store a whopping 100TB of data, making it ideal for data centers and edge servers for IoT services. That’s 20 million songs, or about half of Spotify’s catalog of streaming music. Given its intended applications, the ExaDrive is also designed to consume some 85 percent less power per TB of storage, and its small is a big deal for enterprise customers because it allows them to fit more drives in server racks, reducing the amount of space they take up, as well as cooling bills. Nimbus says that a standard rack kitted with its drives will hold over 100 petabytes (1 petabyte = 1,000 TB). Just don’t count on snapping one up for your gaming rig or media server: it’s going to cost several thousand dollars when it launches this summer. For references, Samsung’s 15TB SSD from mid-2016 cost $10,000.

"Nick Douglas on Offspring, shared by Nick Douglas to Lifehacker","Kids watch movies before they’ve fully learned what’s real and what’s fiction. (One Lifehacker writer used to think that when people died in movies, the actor died in real life.) So sometimes you might need to explain to them how scary scenes were just pretend, and everyone is okay. When those scary scenes involve animals, you can get help from the American Humane Association. The AHA, which monitors film shoots to ensure that animals are treated humanely, has a movie-by-movie database of descriptions of how animals were treated on film sets, and how scenes were shot, including how animals were trained to make certain actions. The descriptions, as BuzzFeed News editor Louis Peitzman points out, are soothing for adults too, and they don’t just cover kids’ movies. Here are some excerpts, with a few spoilers. Show Dogs : When the actor arrests the man and the dog bites the guy’s butt, the trainer placed a tug toy inside the actor’s trousers. Just before action the trainer showed the dog the area on the man’s pants that contained the tug toy. On action the trainer cued the dog, and he bit the man’s butt.﻿ Black Panther : In a couple of the scenes where we see actors ride rhinos, they were actually riding horses, and the horses were turned into rhinos in post-production through CGI. ﻿ Free Willy : Amid soaring background music, the film begins with some spectacular footage of a pod of whales cavorting freely in the ocean. Before long, whaling boats appear and men set nets as they pursue and encircle the whales. One whale is separated from the rest behind a net and calls to the others outside. This scene was accomplished by editing documentary wildlife footage with scenes staged with animatronic whales.﻿ 101 Dalmations : The actor and the dog had been prepped prior to the scene and were very familiar with one another. The dog had been taught to play a shoving game so when the actor pushed him the dog would jump back at the actor instead of away. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone : For the very important delivery of Harry’s Nimbus 2000, a barn owl named Winnie carried a hollow paper broom—which actually weighed less than the owl’s natural prey—that was carefully attached to Winnie’s talons while a trainer held onto the broom’s release mechanism from off camera. At the right mark, the trainer released the broom from the talons with the catch. A Wrinkle in Time : In the scene where the kid sits on the kitchen counter and we see the dog lying on the ground, the dog was led to the predetermined mark on set. Prior to filming the trainer asked the dog to lay down and stay. Dog complies. They filmed the scene and the dog was taken off set for a treat and water. ﻿ Marley and Me : Whenever Marley licks a person or object in the film, baby food was used to entice the dog to lick. The same technique was used with the diaper to encourage the dog to “get it.” All food was deemed safe for consumption, including the dog’s vomit, which was just dog food soaked in water. For scenes in which Marley chews on items, such as the kitchen floor, couch cushions or car seats, trainers cued the dog to “get” the objects. One particular puppy and one particular adult dog were specially trained to chew on things and spit them out without swallowing anything.﻿ Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle : Smoke was not blown in the direction of the chickens.﻿ Jurassic Park : In a scene where an entire steer is fed to a dinosaur, a steer was harnessed in a special cattle sling, hoisted up by a crane, then lowered into foliage. The steer is not shown being devoured, but the effect is created with sound effects. The steer filmed for this scene is a very mellow animal. He had been prepped and rehearsed with it over a period of time prior to filming. The harness was the type normally used to move steer and was safe and secure. Get Out : The dead deer was an animatronic “fake” deer. Production provided a receipt for the fake deer.﻿ Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events : To create the scenes where snakes appear to crawl on the floor, a trainer placed one snake on the ground and let it crawl around while the cameraman filmed the action. Each snake was filmed separately and inserted into the film during post-production.﻿ Homeward Bound : In one scene Chance tricks Sassy onto a seesaw, where she gets catapulted through the air. This scene was done in many cuts. The seesaw lifted up to a height of about four feet and the cat was filmed on it. The cat was then filmed as she was tossed from one trainer to a blanket being held by several people. The cat seemed to love it and purred throughout.﻿ The AHA doesn’t monitor every movie, so check before you promise your kid an explanation. And the association can face some controversy, like when a video seemed to show a handler forcing an anxious dog into rough water during the filming of A Dog’s Purpose. A third-party investigation concluded that the video was misleadingly edited, and that while the dog wasn’t handled perfectly, he showed “no lasting stress response or conditioned fear of the water.” If only watching Cujo at age 5 left “no lasting stress response.” American Humane Association Movie Reviews | via Louis Peitzman","Kids watch movies before they’ve fully learned what’s real and what’s fiction.

Epic's suggested Bluetooth options for Android include the SteelSeries Stratus XL, Gamevice, Xbox One wireless,Razer Raiju and Moto Gamepad. You can probably add SteelSeries' new Stratus Duo to that list. For iOS, the company suggests the SteelSeries Nimbus and Gamevice.

Timothy Prickett Morgan,"December 5, 2017 Timothy Prickett Morgan The server race is really afoot now that IBM has finally gotten off the starting blocks with its first Power9 system, based on its “Nimbus” variant of that processor and turbocharged with the latest “Volta” Tesla GPU accelerators from Nvidia and EDR InfiniBand networks from Mellanox Technologies. The machine launched today, known variously as by the code-name “Witherspoon” or “Newell,” is the building block of the CORAL systems being deployed by the US Department of Energy – “Summit” at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and “Sierra” at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. But more importantly, the Witherspoon system represents a new foundation for IBM’s Power Systems business and its fundamental belief that it can engineer a better system than Intel or AMD can. With help from its OpenPower partners, of course. This machine will be the test of that idea, and the uptake of this system for traditional HPC simulation and modeling workloads as well as the newcomers machine learning and accelerated databases – all of which are dependent on the massively parallel processing and strong node scaling of GPUs – will by and large determine the future of the Power Systems division at IBM. When Big Blue sold off its System x X86 server division back in early 2014, this was the day that IBM was planning for. And the big bet is that the combination of strong serial compute, as embodied in the Power9 chip, plus strong parallel compute, embodied in the Volta GPUs, plus very tight coupling of CPUs and GPUs through the 25 Gb/sec bi-directional signaling in the NVLink 2.0 interconnect, plus the addition of “Bluelink” 25 Gb/sec signaling for OpenCAPI interconnects to persistent memory and other accelerators such as Xilinx FPGAs, plus PCI-Express 4.0 peripheral links (16 Gb/sec both ways, with enhanced CAPI 2.0 support), plus cache coherence across all of these memories in these devices over these various in-node interconnects will present the biggest, baddest, most flexible, and most efficient node that anyone can field. And, with today’s 100 Gb/sec EDR InfiniBand and next year’s 200 Gb/sec HDR InfiniBand, it will be possible to build – as the US government is doing with Summit and Sierra – very powerful systems with dozens to hundreds of petaflops with a modest amount of MPI scaling across the external network. If this doesn’t work for IBM, if this doesn’t give Big Blue a chance to really capture a bigger slice of HPC and take some aggressive share in machine learning and accelerated databases, it is hard to imagine what could. Lifting The Hood On The AC922 We have talked for years about the architecture of the Power9 processors, the benefits of NVLink and OpenCAPI, the transformative nature of the coherency IBM is offering within a node that Intel and AMD do not yet offer, and IBM’s commitment to accelerated computing tuned with different devices for diverse workloads. Now, finally, we can take a look under the hood at the internals of the Witherspoon system. There was some debate within IBM about what to call the Witherspoon system to differentiate it from the past and from the other Power Systems machines based on the Power9 processors – there are two variants, the other being the scale-up “Cumulus” chip for fat NUMA machines that has half the cores, twice the threads, and some of the ports being used for internal NUMA instead external device interconnects – that are coming in the first half of 2018. Some wanted to brand the machine Cognitive Systems, which is the new name for the combination of the System z and Power Systems lines. Some wanted to keep the Power Systems brand and not change things up too much. But for this Witherspoon machine at least, IBM has settled down to the moniker Accelerated Computing, or AC for short, and that leaves it open for the possibility of branding the other Power9 systems aimed at more traditional enterprise workloads as Datacenter Computing, or DC. The Witherspoon system is sold under the brand the AC922, where the AC means the style – hybrid CPU and GPU compute with room for other accelerators – the 9 means it uses the Power9 chip, the first two means it is a two-socket CPU system, and the second 2 means it is a 2U server form factor. (IBM has sold Power8 and Power8+ machines with 1U, 2U, and 4U form factors using the scale-out variant of the chips.) Here is what it looks like in an artsy exploded view: Here is the mechanical view of the system: And finally, here is the system board block diagram: Because artificial intelligence is an easier sell these days than just about anything, IBM is very keen that its branding for this Power9 system is that it is architected for AI. But make no mistake about it. The AC922 is aimed at any workload – HPC, AI, visualization, database, and things we have not thought of yet – where customers need to mix CPUs, GPUs, and perhaps a modest amount of other kinds of persistent storage and FPGA compute into a single, strong node. The Power9 motors in the AC922 are pretty modest compared to what we expect for Big Blue to eventually bring to the field. Rather than the dual-chip modules that were used in the scale-out systems during the Power8 and Power8+ generations, the Nimbus Power9 chip used in the AC922 is a single chip module that has 24 cores on the die. The Summit and Sierra machines based on the AC922 are getting 22 core versions of the chips – we don’t know the clock speeds – but the commercial-grade AC922 has only two processor options. There is a 16-core version of the Nimbus chip that has a base clock speed of 2.6 GHz and that turbos up to 3.09 GHz, and then there is another version that has 20 cores running at 2 GHz that turbos up to 2.87 GHz. These chips are rated at 190 watts, which is a little lower than past generations of Power processors, and considerably lower, we suspect, than the Cumulus Power9 chips will be for bigger NUMA clusters that scale to four, eight, twelve, or sixteen sockets in a single system image. (See more on the rumors we have heard about the future “Fleetwood” Power9 NUMA iron, due next year, in this story.) As far as we know, the 22 core variant of the Nimbus chip is the top-end one for the AC922. IBM could later, as Power9 yields improve, add a 24 core option. It has the thermal headroom, we suspect, particularly with the top bin 28-core “Skylake” Xeon SP-8180M weighing in at 205 watts. The AC922 has up to sixteen registered DIMM DDR4 main memory slots, and unlike prior Power8 and Power8+ systems (except for a few homegrown ones through the OpenPower collective), these memory sticks are bog standard DIMMs and do not use IBM’s “Centaur” memory buffer chips. This cuts the amount of memory slots per socket in half, which cuts down the memory bandwidth by half, but it also enables more cost effective server nodes for HPC and AI clusters where the amount of memory on the GPU accelerator is more important – or as important at least – as the memory on the CPU. (That said, we think that once coherency across CPUs and accelerators takes off, you might find an in-memory bend, and companies may start building fat memory as well as fat compute nodes. We shall see.) At this point, IBM is supporting memory sticks with 16 GB, 32 GB, and 64 GB of capacity, and they are all running at 2.67 GHz. IBM is charging $35 per GB for the skinnier two sticks and $39 per GB for the fatter one; this is a lot less than it charges other Power Systems customers for its buffered memory. IBM is requiring that all memory slots be filled, by the way, even though this is obviously not a technical requirement. That is the only way to get the 306 GB/sec of aggregate memory bandwidth across the two sockets. IBM will eventually support up to 2 TB of memory capacity using 128 GB memory sticks, probably fairly early in 2018 if pricing pressures ease. The bulk of the parallel compute capacity on the AC922 server is designed to come from Tesla Volta coprocessors, and the system can be configured with either four or six of the Volta G100 accelerators. As you can see, there is definitely some affinity between the CPUs and GPUs, with half of the four or six Volta SXM2 GPUs in the system hanging off each socket. Each Power9 chip has six NVLink ports coming off it, and two of these, which Nvidia calls bricks and which has eight lanes running at 25 Gb/sec, are ganged up into either two or three pipes, depending on how many GPUs are hanging off each CPU. The AC922 with four GPUs will be available as an air-cooled system, which is what Lawrence Livermore has opted for with Sierra, and with six GPUs it will be available as a water-cooled system, which is what Oak Ridge has chosen for Summit. (There are other differences, such as Sierra having only 256 GB of CPU memory because of budgetary restrictions and Oak Ridge finding extra money to keep the planned 512 GB.) In the system with four GPUs, the NVLinks hooking together all of the compute deliver 150 GB/sec of bandwidth between the elements, and on the system with six GPUs, the NVLinks are stepped down to 100 GB/sec to keep it all in balance. Interestingly, if you look closely at the chart above, it not only shows IBM will be boosting memory capacity by 2X with these systems, but it will deliver 3 GHz DDR4 memory sticks that boost the memory bandwidth per socket from 153 GB/sec with 2.67 GHz memory to 170 GB/sec with that 3 GHz memory. By the way, the Power9 processing card with 16 cores running at 3.09 GHz turbo costs $2,999, and the Power9 card that has 20 cores running at 2.87 GHz turbo costs $3,999. This is very inexpensive Power cores by IBM standards. IBM is charging $11,499 for a Volta GPU accelerator. The AC922 has a minimalist approach to I/O, in terms of having only what IBM expects that HPC and AI shops will need to do their big compute jobs. We expect that other Power Systems variants of the machines – if they are indeed called that – will have a lot more expansion capability. The Witherspoon server has a shared two-port 100 Gb/sec network interface card mounted right onto the motherboard, and this NIC interconnects with two PCI-Express 4.0 x8 slots coming off the controllers on the Power9 die. Each socket also has a native PCI-Express 4.0 x16 slot that is enabled with the CAPI 2.0 protocol for coherence between non-GPU accelerators and persistent memory devices like flash and 3D XPoint or ReRAM. One of the sockets has a PCI-Express 4 x4 slot. Interestingly, IBM has put a PLX Technologies PEX 8733 32-lane, 18-port PCI-Express switch onto the motherboard, which links to both processors and to all six GPU accelerators on one end and a storage controller on the other end. This allows for more traditional storage to route directly to the GPUs through the switch and now have to go to the CPUs to get to them. Each GPU has a two-lane (x2) bus coming off the switch, and the links are four lanes wide (x4) coming out of the controller and going up into the CPU. The USB ports and baseboard management controller (which is based on the OPAL microcode that IBM created in conjunction with Google) all hang off the primary processor and eat one PCI-Express 4.0 lane (x1) each. In addition to that two-port InfiniBand interface, the AC922 has a quad port 10 Gb/sec Ethernet adapter and a single port 100 Gb/sec Ethernet adapter that snaps into the PCI-Express 4.0 slots. The air-cooled version of the AC922 that has four Volta GPUs is going to be generally available on December 22, Dylan Boday, the offering manager for this HPC/AI machine at the Cognitive Systems division, tells The Next Platform. As we have previously reported, both Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore are starting to get Witherspoon machines installed, and eventually will have 4,600 and 4,320 nodes, respectively, with Oak Ridge getting the six GPU version and Lawrence Livermore getting the four GPU version. Call it 10,000 nodes. (Lawrence Livermore has an unclassified machine, called uSierra, with 684 nodes that it is installing, too.) But they are not getting all of the nodes. According to Boday, IBM has been running a jump start program for eager and early adopters for the last month and has set aside some nodes for this purpose, and has several hundreds of nodes that it can sell right now, before December ends. (Boday says he just completed an order for a proof of concept that has three dozen Witherspoon nodes, and the pipeline is full.) Sometime during the first half of 2018 – IBM is being intentionally vague here – the company will deliver the six GPU water-cooled variant of Witherspoon to the wider commercial customer base. For local storage, the AC922 has two 2.5-inch drive bays and a SATA storage controller for flash drives. The flash drives come in 960 GB, 1.92 TB, and 3.84 TB capacities at costs of $886, $1,689, and $3,960, respectively. IBM is offering a 1 TB, 7200 RPM disk drive as an option, too. (We don’t know the performance specs of the storage.) IBM also has a 1.6 TB NVM-Express flash card that it is selling for $3,099. Boday says that IBM will ship a fatter 3.2 TB NVM-Express flash card for the Witherspoon machine by the end of the year. This flash is being used like a baby “burst buffer” inside the nodes so they don’t have to reach out over the network for scratch storage, says Boday. At the moment, The AC922 server is certified using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 for Power (the little endian version) and a future version of Ubuntu Server will come out in the second quarter. IBM’s commitment to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server on Power is waning and it is still examining this, which is odd given the popularity of SUSE Linux in HPC and SAP HANA in-memory computing. The real issue is what will an AC922 node cost loaded up. The prior generation Power Systems S822LC for HPC, code-named “Minksy” and essentially the development platform for the Witherspoon boxes, cost around $65,000 or so loaded up with two Power8+ processors, four “Pascal” P100 GPU accelerators, and 256 GB of main memory for the CPUs. Boday says that IBM is going to keep that price point about the same for the same configuration of the AC922, with two Power9 chips, four Volta GPUs accelerators, and 256 GB of memory. IBM was charging $50,000 in September 2016 when the Minksy launched for a box with 128 GB of memory and two ten-core Power8 chips running at 2.86 GHz. The Witherspoon system will have twice as much CPU compute and, depending on the measure, 2X to 6X the GPU compute, and lots more I/O bandwidth, too. Up next, we will be taking a look at the performance benchmarks IBM has run on the new AC922 and how it compares to other GPU accelerated systems. Stay tuned.

TheCuttingBored,"All Harry Potter brooms have feet stirrups for their wizard owners to ride. This part was a little complicated to figure out. To build it, I chose to go with another stack lamination / carving process - I just liked the idea of the whole thing being wood. I took more scrap white oak I had and broke it down on the miter saw and then glued together individual pieces step by step until I ended up with rough shapes of the two core components of the feed stirrup ( Pics 1-3 ). I then used the mini-turbo to power-carve the shape roughly. It was pretty quick and easy actually - the mini turbo works just like the Turboplane but allows you to get into smaller spaces ( Pics 4-5 ). I don't show it, but after carving, I did some more sanding to smooth and round over each piece, as well as thin the entire profile of it. Pic 6 shows me using my router table to add a round over profile to each size. Router tables rule. The stirrups have two thin strips of wood that connect the two pieces - in the movies they fold up in a fun way - but for the sake of this prop, I just made it structurally rigid. Pic 7 shows me sanding down those pieces thin from more oak. I then used glue and my pin nailer to combine everything, resulting in that fun little stirrup piece ( Pics 8-9 ).",<!--dda7bd42579b4dc0937c45f979fc5c69-->Building things is fun. Harry Potter is fun.

Us,"Status’ goal is to drive mass adoption of Ethereum. In order to do this, we have had to play an active part in the development of the ecosystem at many levels: from improving Whisper, to working on Light Clients, to doing UX research and studies about the best patterns for easy and intuitive use of web3 frameworks. Much like many other projects now on Mainnet, the next big issue we have to tackle is scalability of the network itself. In order to advance the collective work on scaling Ethereum, we have been building our own client, called Nimbus, which has a particular focus on sharding. Nimbus is written in a language called Nim, which offers us various unique features capable of handling both the complex computations required, while ensuring they can still happen on resource-restricted devices. Sharding, Plasma, STARKs, better signature aggregation — all of these things will contribute to the sort of network and transaction processing speed we all need to make Ethereum a truly global phenomenon and actually build a more open, transparent, and secure internet. We are blessed, as always, to be able to work with many different people from across the community on solving these problems collectively and look forward to learning and contributing actively to scaling Ethereum so that we can build, together, the global computer we all envision. What exactly is Nimbus? Nimbus is a research project and a client implementation for sharding, light clients, and next-generation Ethereum technologies addressing the concerns of scalability and wide access. We feel Ethereum 2.0 will mostly live in embedded systems, so have designed Nimbus to perform well on IoT and personal mobile devices, including older smartphones with resource-restricted hardware. We also aim to make Nimbus extensible, configurable, and modular. A client designed to work well on mobile and embedded systems, that is modular enough to allow for rapid iteration and implementation of the research being done in terms of scaling will, we feel, advance greatly the goals of Ethereum as a decentralised ecosystem. We have chosen to implement Nimbus in the programming language Nim because it is lightweight and therefore well suited to running efficiently on resource-restricted devices. The project has led us to better learn the Ethereum protocol, as well as attract highly specialized engineers with a deep understanding of the nuances of language. Nim has a rapid development process, good performance, and a syntax very similar to Python (which is used by the Ethereum Foundation for research) which allows us to more easily port existing research. The Nimbus team comprises talented and experienced people: Eugene Kabanov, Jacek Sieka, Mamy Ratsimbazafy, Ryan Lipscombe, Yuriy Glukhov, Zahary Karadjov, and Dustin Brody. These engineers are some of the most experienced with Nim and have a deep understanding and passion for blockchain and cutting-edge technologies. What are our goals? Status started with the high level goal of contributing to the Web3 ecosystem through our own research. Our goals as a project are well aligned with that of the larger Ethereum community and we want to do our part to support its growth. Now with this team of highly experienced researchers in place, we have defined the following goals for the Nimbus project: Create a mobile first client (energy and compute efficiency) for the full Web3 stack: decentralized logic, decentralized storage, and decentralized messaging. Optimize for embedded devices and enable new and innovative use cases such as AndroidTV, point-of-sales units, or IoT devices. Nimbus will be licensed under Apache 2.0 and MIT; a permissive licensing structure with patent protection that will extend the reach of the Ethereum platform. Design a research friendly client (using Nim) that enables rapid development and promotes a faster move to production. Craft a high quality Ethereum implementation to strengthen the network against single client failures The impact we hope to make with Nimbus is to add a mobile-first implementation to the Ethereum client ecosystem, ultimately increasing its resilience and potential user base. The Nimbus team has been steadily making progress for the past 3 months and progress can be tracked here. We have a clear roadmap and we will be sharing progress updates as well as technical deep dives into some of the implementation approaches regularly on our new research blog. For more information about Nimbus, join us on Riot or github. Curious about the name? Check out the full project proposal.

Jon Evans,"It was, briefly, the zeitgeist’s perfect Silicon Valley story: a sex-and-drugs party hosted hosted by since-ousted top-tier VC Steve Jurvetson, at an official Draper Fisher Jurvetson event,attended by multiple billionaires including Elon Musk. So said Paul Biggar, founder of CircleCI, in a widely read Medium post, expanding on Vanity Fair’s excerpt of Emily Chang’s new book. (To be clear, it was Axios who subsequently named Jurvetson and DFJ.) Is that actually what happened? Did a major Valley VC firm host a decadent sex-and-MDMA party as part of one of its official events smack in the midst of last year’s widespread sexual-harassment revelations? Uhhhhhh. Well. As it turns out, not so much. Biggar notes that he didn’t actually see anything outrageous or salacious happening by the time he left, and, it seems others have vouched that, afterwards … such things continued to not happen: I want to share some longer remarks on the so-called Silicon Valley elite “sex party” that’s making the rounds. (Be warned: the truth is boring.) pic.twitter.com/T4BrLTeFof — Mason Hartman (@webdevMason) January 12, 2018 In fairness to Chang, she was writing about secret Valley sex parties in general, mentioned in passing that “while some parties may be devoted primarily to drugs and sexual activity, others may boast just pockets of it,” and cited this particular event — and a woman there being given drugs by one man, and then hit on by another in an inappropriate and exploitative way — as an example. So what happened at that party? It sounds like the answer is “at least two instances of shitty behavior which are basically, infuriatingly, pretty typical examples of how the tech industry treats women.” But it also sounds like it was basically a fairly tame, if themed and Burning-Man-ish, event which some culturally conservative people saw and immediately misinterpreted as a sex party. Which is exactly why I call it the perfect Silicon Valley story: everyone is looking for lightning-rod reasons to hate the Valley right now. The sex-party narrative is like a Rorschach excuse. Right-wingers can condemn it as an example of tech’s corrupt, decadent liberalism. Leftists can excoriate it as an instance of tech’s bone-deep sexism and exploitative hegemony of privileged white men. This is just one especially vivid example. Slings and arrows from across the political spectrum are being aimed at tech. Liberals point out that it has treated women abominably for decades, while Asians face a “bamboo ceiling” and other nonwhite people are all but excluded; they blame Facebook for the election, Twitter for allowing Donald Trump and neo-nazis to run rampant, Amazon and Google for avoiding taxes, etc. Conservatives, meanwhile, accuse tech of a lack of “ viewpoint diversity ” — which bespeaks a bizarre miscomprehension that their belief systems are rejected purely because they’re different, when in fact they are rejected because climate-change denialism, and denying the systemic oppression of people who weren’t born white men, are as demonstrably &amp; morally incorrect as e.g. flat-eartherism and eugenics, and treated accordingly. Slightly more plausibly, they accuse Facebook of censoring conservative news, while targeting Twitter for shadow-banning right-wingers. While the ""shithole"" story continues to dominate on mainstream outlets, over in the RW media universe, Breitbart still giving all its attention to allegations Twitter is biased against conservatives… pic.twitter.com/mpgJO0ceke — Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) January 12, 2018 But wait, there’s more! As the rent crisis wracks America, its victims, desperate for affordable housing in desirable places, hate the tech industry for gentrifying the cities — San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, NYC, Boston, etc — where people most want to live. Meanwhile, as the media hemorrhages money, it becomes ever more reliant on Facebook and Google — even as that duopoly devours most of the advertising dollars that used to go to the media. And as both media and finance go tech, East Coasters (and Londoners) see that their center-of-the-universe influence, which they once thought unassailable, has moved to California and beyond. Is it really that surprising, when you follow the money, that the American media’s love affair with the tech industry is coming to a bitter and increasingly furious end? The reason why is obvious. We have the money, now. Seven of the ten largest publicly traded companies in the world are tech companies, and three of them are headquartered within cycling distance of one another in Silicon Valley, surrounded by a nimbus of dozens of unicorns. With that wealth comes huge (at least perceived) power — not just financial, but the power to shape the future, to influence the masses, to shape mass political movements. Do you see a lot of popular narratives whose heroes are privileged, unelected engineers and investors whose previously sizable wealth has grown into immense riches and enormous power? Uh, no. In fact you may have noticed that, in virtually every popular story, such people are the bad guys. There’s a reason for that: historically, power corrupts. People everywhere are already eager for lightning-rod trumped-up reasons to hate the Valley and the tech industry as a whole. And it’s not like we haven’t given them at least a few real ones. So it might be time to start thinking less about money and power, and more about values, and how we might actually make sacrifices in service of those values — because history indicates that blatant, widespread hypocrisy is one of several effective ways to transform a lightning rod into an angry mob wielding pitchforks and torches.","It was, briefly, the zeitgeist’s perfect Silicon Valley story: a sex-and-drugs party hosted hosted by since-ousted top-tier VC Steve Jurvetson, at an official Draper Fisher Jurvetson event,attended by multiple billionaires including Elon Musk.

"feedback@businessinsider.com (Kylie Joyner), Kylie Joyner","The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Brooks/Facebook/Business Insider The Insider Pick: Running doesn’t require a lot of equipment, but a good pair of running shoes is a must-have to prevent injury. The Brooks Ghost 10 is the ultimate workhorse of women’s running shoes with a lightweight yet cushioned feel, a breathable upper, and the durability to grind out a lot of miles. Whether you’re just beginning your running journey, or you're an experienced runner looking for a new shoe to try out, finding a quality pair of running shoes is the first step to guaranteeing that your future running endeavors will be enjoyable. It wasn’t so long ago that not much thought was given to the difference between male and female runners and their separate needs as athletes. The go-to phrase was, “shrink ‘em and pink ‘em.” Luckily, athletic companies have moved away from this simplistic — not to mention sexist — standard and have taken into consideration that women’s bodies are different than men’s, so they need running shoes made specifically for them. With so many women representing the running population, this is a smart move. In 2016, women made up 58% of all the 5k races in the United States and 43% of all marathons. Women's vs. men's running shoes So what makes a woman’s model of a running shoe different than a man’s? First off, women tend to have smaller heels in relation to the forefoot, so the shape of the shoe will be slightly different. A lower body mass results in slightly less foam in the midsole of the shoe and deeper grooves make it easier to flex the midsole when toeing off. Men and women also have different Q-angles, or the angle of incidence between the quad muscle and the kneecap, as women generally have wider hips than men. This can cause pronation to occur, which requires different types of cushioning. Overpronation vs. underpronation If you overpronate, your foot tends to roll inward too far as you run, and your body isn’t absorbing shock as efficiently. For overpronation, you’ll want a more supportive motion-control shoe to help correct your foot motion. If you underpronate, your foot isn’t rolling in far enough, making the outside of it take the brunt of the impact after the initial heel strike. If this is the case, you’ll want a more neutral-cushioned shoe that will encourage a more natural foot motion. This is one of the most important things to consider when buying running shoes, as overpronation or underpronation can cause serious injury over time if it’s not addressed. Different shoes for different types of running You’ll also want to consider the type of running you’ll be doing. Are you planning on doing a lot of road racing? A lightweight shoe will likely be best. Do you tend to do your long runs on trails? Then you may want a shoe designed specifically for trail running. If you’re looking for a simple training shoe for casual running, then durability may not be a big concern. However, if you’re the type of runner who lives in their running shoes, finding a high mileage shoe will give you the best quality for your money. It may sound overwhelming, but luckily we’ve done the research for you and chosen what we think are the best women’s running shoes based on a variety of running needs. Here are our top picks for the best women's running shoes: Updated on 5/25/2018 by Kylie Joyner: Added the Brooks Ghost 10 and the New Balance 860v8 to replace older models. Also updated prices. Read on in the slides below to check out our top picks. The best running shoes overall Why you'll love them: The Brooks Ghost 10 shoes are durable enough for long runs, light enough for speed work, and the newly designed seamless mesh upper fits comfortably. One of my grandfather’s favorite phrases was, “if it ain't broke, don’t fix it.” This sentiment is exactly why the Brooks Ghost line of running shoes remains a favorite among runners. The Brooks Ghost 10 keeps all the great features found in the Ghost 9, allowing this running shoe to continue to do what it does so well: tackle everything from long distances to short and snappy speed work. It provides both comfort and durability so you and the shoes can handle it all. If you’re looking for a cushioned neutral running shoe, the Brooks Ghost 10 should be considered for your new go-to. While it keeps what works in the Ghost 9, the Ghost 10 does make a few small improvements that make for an even more comfortable and secure fit. The newly designed upper features a seamless engineered mesh for added breathability, and thanks to the flexible material, the toe box feels roomier without being too loose. The extra cushioning in the heel makes these ideal running shoes for those who have suffered from Plantar Fasciitis, the inflammation of the tissue that connects the heel bone to the toes. The Brooks Ghost is considered a cushioned-neutral shoe, so it won’t provide the stability needed for overpronation. However, if you’re a neutral runner, or if you’re a heel striker looking for more comfort on longer runs, the Brooks Ghost 10 is a great place to start. The grooves in the outsole enhance the heel to toe transition, allowing for smooth ground contact, and the outsole itself has a thick layer of rubber to absorb impact. The midsole design of the Ghost 10 has slightly softer cushioning for an even more responsive feel. The 12mm heel to toe drop remains the same as it was in the Ghost 9, but creates the smooth feeling ride the Ghost is known for. It comes as no surprise that the 10 received the 6 th Editor’s Choice award from Runners World. According to the publication, “it was the number one pick among our wear-testers.” The women’s Ghost 10 weighs in at 8.8oz, slightly lighter than the Ghost 9. While it’s heavier than many of the lightweight running shoes available, its design allows it to keep a fast and responsive feel usually found in lightweight models. According to the reviewer from Running Shoes Guru, the Ghost 10 is responsive, but “cushioned to the point where double-digit runs are no problem.” The versatility of this shoe is what makes it a true winner. I can personally speak to the comfort and smooth ride the Ghost 10 provides. After running in New Balance for years, I recently made the switch to the Brooks Ghost 10. I’ve been extremely happy with the fit, cushioning, and durability of these shoes. They’re so comfortable that I often find myself wearing them to run errands, and they’ve served me well as I’ve ramped up my mileage over the last few months. The increased comfort, as well as a consistent price, make it worth upgrading to the Ghost 10. It’s worth noting that the price for every new Brooks Ghost model has remained the same for the past 4 years, coming in at $120. Pros: Well-cushioned while still having a light feel, smooth heel to toe transition, new seamless upper design for added breathability and comfort, versatile design is ideal for both speed work and long distances Cons: On the heavier side, won’t provide enough support for overpronation The best running shoes for support Why you'll love them: The New Balance 860v8 are stability shoes that provide a smooth, comfortable ride from heel to toe for those who overpronate. As tried and true stability shoes, the New Balance 860 line is entering its 8 th year with the 860v8. Much of the shoe’s design keeps what works well in the 860v7, like the roomy toe box and the dual density TruFuse midsole for a soft yet supportive feel. The 10mm heel drop also remains the same, so you’ll get a smooth, more natural feeling ride. However, there are some welcome updates, like the newly designed mesh upper. The upgraded material is breathable and provides even more flexibility for added comfort in the toe box. A dual density stability post has also been added for additional support. While these shoes are on the heavier side, unlike many stability shoes, the 860v8 finds the balance between providing the right amount of support without completely weighing you down. A plastic shank under the arch provides a snappy and responsive feel often found in lighter running shoes. The 860v8 excels at providing a steady and well-supported run, and it’s designed to last. The comfort alone makes this shoe a winner in the support department — especially if you have wider feet. The broad toe box will allow your toes to splay naturally as you run and will prevent any uncomfortable toe rubbing which can eventually cause blisters. The durability of this shoe makes it ideal for high-mileage, so if you’re looking for a pair that can withstand daily training, the 860v8 is well worth considering. It doesn’t sacrifice style for comfort either. While many running shoes are limiting when it comes to color choices, that isn’t the case for the 860v8. This new version comes in 7 different color schemes, so you can choose your favorite. Narrow, standard, wide and extra wide options are available. Most reviewers have had a great experience with the 860v8, calling it a successful update to the 860v7. Even those who don’t run regularly, or just want added support throughout the day at work or while running errands find themselves turning to this stability shoe. Carol S., a reviewer on New Balance's site says, “As a nurse, I’m on my feet most of the day. I’ve worn New Balance for years. This shoe gives me the support I need and the color and style are very nice!” Terry, another reviewer on New Balance's site loves the “incredible support.” She had the previous version of this shoe but says, “the new version is even better!” Pros: Great support for overpronation, cushioning provides a comfortable ride, newly designed mesh upper provides more breathability, added posting for additional stability, 10mm drop provides a more natural heel to toe motion Cons: On the heavier side, not ideal for neutral runners who don’t need additional support, some runners find the midsole too firm The best running shoes for trails Why you'll love them: The Hoka One One Challenger ATR 3 shoes are designed to handle rough terrain on the trails with maximum cushioning, but the lightweight feel lets you transition from the trail to the road anytime you want. While some trail shoes tend to be on the heavy side, the Hoka One One (pronounced o-nay o-nay) Challenger ATR 3 shoes manage to provide maximum cushioning while still being lightweight. The women’s shoe weighs in at a surprising 7.9 ounces. All you have to do is look at the Challenger ATR 3 shoes to see that they fall into the maximal cushioning running shoe category. While they may not be the prettiest running shoes on the market, all of that cushioning offers less stress and impact to the body. This combined with a rugged outsole make the Challenger ATR 3 the perfect shoe for tackling long trail runs. If you begin or end your runs on the road, the traction and grip performance of this shoe works just as well on muddy trails as it does on the pavement, and its lightweight feel will provide you with a seamless transition. Running Shoes Guru gave the Challenger ATR 3 high marks, stating that it can be worn for “a fast-paced half marathon on the roads, and then handle 50 miles on burly terrain the next day.” Its rugged durability makes this shoe a favorite for casual trail runners as well as the racing shoe of choice for ultra-marathoners. This runner tested the Challenger ATR 3 for their first 50k marathon. The trails that made up the race offered everything from mud, creek crossing, loose soil, and gravel — and the Challenger conquered it all with ease. It should be noted that despite all the cushioning, the Challenger ATR 3 is considered a neutral running shoe, so it won’t offer much in terms of support for overpronators. The toe box has a narrower design as well. While some runners found this helpful to prevent the foot from slipping and sliding during steep uphills and downhills, others with wider feet would have liked more room. To remedy this, this reviewer sized up to find their perfect fit. Overall, most reviewers on Amazon liked the cushioned, yet lightweight feel of the Challenger ATR 3 as well as their substantial tread. If you’re looking for a comfortable trail shoe that won’t weigh you down, this is a great shoe to try out whether you want a more cushioned ride for casual trail runs, or you’re a modern-day Wonder Woman tackling your next ultra-marathon. Pros: Fantastic cushioning to weight ratio, rugged outsole with 4mm lugs provides good traction on both trails and roads Cons: Snug fit especially in the toe box — a size up may be needed for a perfect fit, not suited for overpronators The best lightweight running shoes Why you'll love them: The lightweight build of the Asics Gel-DS Trainer 22 shoes make them ideal as both a trainer and a racer. The Asics brand has a long, rich history when it comes to running shoes. The company started in 1949 as Onitsuka Co. Ltd. In Kobe, Japan. In 1977 it became known as the ASICS Corporation, an acronym for “Anima Sana In Corpore Sano,” which means, “a sound mind in a sound body.” Asics is a favorite brand among runners and consistently shows up on “best running shoes” lists. The Asics Gel-DS Trainer 22 is no exception. This shoe has an extremely light design while still providing a good amount of support. One of the most noticeable updates with the Trainer 22 is the use of Asics’ new FlyteFoam technology. This light and flexible foam makes it possible for these shoes to weigh in at 6.7 ounces. Running Shoes Guru praises the update that absorbs shock and acts as a springboard allowing for a fast lift off. There is a 10mm heel-to-toe drop, but the flexibility of this shoe gives it a natural feel that makes the drop seem even lower. The Trainer 22 is a reliable workhorse of a trainer that can transform into a lightning fast hummingbird when it’s time to lace up for a race. It also provides an adequate amount of stability for those who overpronate. The idea that stability shoes need to be heavy will be left in the dust once you put these on. More prominent lugs on the forefoot of the shoe provide traction along with stability, making tight turns and direction changes a breeze. While the design of the shoe itself is aesthetically pleasing, the one downside is that this model comes in a very limited color selection. Though there isn’t a rainbow of flashy colors to choose from, they do sport reflective details in the heel for added visibility. Some runners also report having to size up to find their perfect fit. This Amazon reviewer gave the Trainer 22 a full 5 stars because of the shoes' lightweight feel and the stability they provided with no insoles needed. Pros: Extremely Lightweight thanks to FlyteFoam technology, fast and responsive, provides stability for overpronators, excellent grip Cons: Limited color choices, lack of optional widths creating a need to size up in some cases The best running shoes for high mileage Why you'll love them: The durable midsole and outsole of the Asics Gel-Nimbus 18 shoes ensure that they will last through the miles without losing the cushioning or comfort of a ""cloud runner."" Most runners can agree that their running shoes often do double duty as grocery shopping shoes, take the dog for a walk shoes, dash to the dry cleaner before it closes shoes … you get the idea. A true sign of comfortable running shoes are the ones that seem to find their way onto your feet even when you’re not running. The Asics Gel-Nimbus 18 is that type of running shoe, and luckily it’s made with durability in mind to handle all the daily steps you take in addition to your running regimen. According to Runners World, the Nimbus line from Asics was the original “cloud runner” with extra cushioning from heel to toe. For the Nimbus 18, Asics uses soft rubber in the forefoot and harder rubber in areas that experience high wear to maximize both the comfort and durability. The gel cushioning mentioned in the name rests just above the outsole of the shoe, serving the purpose of reducing shock for both landing and takeoff. The Fluidride midsole provides cushioning and stability. The added stability is good for those who overpronate, and all the additional cushioning the shoe provides is beneficial for runners who suffer from reoccurring knee and hip issues. Having this level of comfort and support makes the Nimbus 18 an ideal shoe for high-mileage runs. More miles lead to additional impact on the body and a higher chance of injury if you’re not running in a quality, well-fitting shoe. According to Run Repeat, some runners did feel the toe box was too narrow and that the fit was tighter than they were used to in a running shoe. However, most women, including this distance runner, say that the Nimbus 18 is one of the most comfortable pair of shoes they’ve ever owned. While the Nimbus 19 is the newest version in the Asics Nimbus line, the Nimbus 18 received consistently positive reviews in comparison, making it the reigning champion for this pick. Pros: Comfortable fit with a pillow-like feel, stability for overpronators and those prone to hip and knee issues, durable construction, built to reduce impact Cons: Cushioning places it on the heavier side, some found the toe box to be too narrow Check out our other running gear buying guides With the right clothes, you’ll actually want to get to the gym and show off your style before meeting friends for a much-deserved drink afterward.

Ry Crist,"Last summer, Philips teased new ""Hue Entertainment"" partnerships meant to help sync its popular, color-changing smart bulbs with movies, TV shows, and video games. We've been waiting patiently to hear more ever since, and today, at CES 2018, Philips has some fresh details. You'll need a Razer Chroma-enabled device and a second-gen Philips Hue Bridge in order to sync your lights up with games like Overwatch. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Those details come in the form of a new partnership with the gaming lifestyle brand Razer. It's the first official Hue Entertainment partnership the company has publicly confirmed, and PC gamers who enable it will be able to sync color-changing lighting effects with popular games like Overwatch, DOTA2, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The partnership links Hue's lights with Razer Chroma-enabled devices, including laptops, keyboards, and gaming mice. To enable it, users will need a second-gen Philips Hue Bridge (the square-shaped one), along with free Razer Synapse software that will be available to anyone using a Razer Chroma-enabled device beginning on January 9. Other partnerships are in the works, too, potentially including ones that would bring console gamers into the mix. Philips tells us that those partnerships will continue rolling out throughout the year.

Catherine Shu,"Developing new medicines can take years of research and cost millions of dollars before they are even ready for clinical trials. Several biotech startups are using machine learning to revolutionize the process and get drugs into pharmacies more quickly. One of the newest is called Reverie Labs, which is part of Y Combinator’s latest batch. The Boston-based company wants to fix a critical bottleneck in the drug development process by speeding up the process of identifying promising molecules using recently published machine learning algorithms. Reverie Labs’ founders Connor Duffy, Ankit Gupta and Jonah Kallenbach, who named their company after a pivotal detail in the HBO series “Westworld,” explain that its tech analyzes early ideas for molecules from pharmaceutical scientists and suggests possible improvements to shorten the amount of time it takes to reach clinical trials. Duffy says Reverie Labs’ ambition is to “become a full service molecule-as-a-service company.” It’s already partnered with several biotech companies and academic institutes working on treatments for diseases including influenza and cancer. Reverie Labs specializes in the lead development stage, which is when researchers focus on prioritizing and optimizing molecules so they can go to animal and human clinical trials more quickly. Pharmaceutical scientists need to first identify the proteins that cause a disease and then find molecular compounds that can bind to those proteins. Then it becomes a process of elimination as they narrow down those molecules to ones that not only create the results they want, but are also suitable for animal and human studies. Before clinical trials can start, however, they need to evaluate molecules very carefully in order to understand things like how they are metabolized by the body and their potential toxicity. “I’ve heard it compared to juggling eight balls at once or playing whack-a-mole,” says Duffy. “You want your compound to be very safe before you put it in people, you want to be efficacious and go where you want it to go in your body and you don’t want side effects. There are a lot of problems drug companies need to think about before putting a molecule in a human, and when you fix one problem, you often come up with another problem. We want to alleviate that by looking at all problems at the same time.” Lead development is very labor intensive and requires the work of many medicinal chemists. Reverie Labs’ founders say it often takes more than $100 million and two years per drug before a final selection of molecules are ready for clinical trials. Reverie Labs wants to set itself apart from other startups focused on solving the same problem by taking recently-discovered machine learning techniques, and applying them to drug development. “The machine learning algorithms we implemented are some of the most promising advances that have been published in the past couple of years,” says Kallenbach. First, molecules are “featurized,” or turned into representations that work with machine learning algorithms. Reverie Labs’s tech creates proprietary featurizations based on quantum chemical calculations, then uses them to analyze the molecules’ properties and how they may act in the body. Afterwards, it selects molecules that have the potential to do well in clinical trials or suggests new molecules based on what properties scientists need. In addition to the machine learning algorithms it uses, Reverie Labs founders say one of the startup’s key differentiators is that it trains its models on customers’ proprietary in-house datasets, which means the tech can integrate more smoothly into existing drug development workflows. Reverie Labs’ software also runs on customers’ virtual private clouds, giving them more security. While using artificial intelligence to develop new drugs seemed almost like science fiction just a few years ago, the space is developing quickly. Last month, BenevolentAI, one of the first companies to apply deep learning to drug discovery, bought biotech company Promixagen’s operations in the United Kingdom, which it says will make it the first artificial intelligence company to cover the entire drug research and development process. Atomwise, another AI-based drug discovery startup, announced at the beginning of this month that it has raised a $45 million Series A. Other notable startups include Nimbus Therapeutics and Recursion Pharmaceuticals. The process of creating new drugs is currently very complicated, slow and extremely expensive. With so much room for improvement, the work done by various AI-based startups to improve the process don’t necessarily overlap. “The space doesn’t seem like a zero sum game at all,” says Gupta. “Many players can be involved and the fact that other startups are interested shows that there is legitimacy to the technology.” “The end result is trying to delivery life-saving cures faster and more cheaply,” adds Duffy. “We don’t really feel any competitiveness. We want everyone to succeed.”",Developing new medicines can take years of research and cost millions of dollars before they are even ready for clinical trials. Several biotech startups are using machine learning to revolutionize the process and get drugs into pharmacies more quickly.

BEN BRANTLEY,"What’s more, unlike the current resident of the White House, Philippe comes to see art as a healing and redemptive force. And with art given sublime voice here by the British countertenor Iestyn Davies, you are unlikely to argue with the King’s belief in its holy transcendence. Mr. Davies does not portray the celebrated countertenor of the play’s title, who is recruited to soothe the King’s savage breast. Or not exactly. Yes, he appears on stage in full 18th-century costume but only to sing (blissfully) arias by Handel. Farinelli, the young Italian opera star who was castrated at the age of 10 by his musician brother, is affectingly embodied by another, identically dressed actor, Sam Crane. This unconfident man does not feel he produces, much less owns, the exquisite notes that come out of him. That voice, which has made a freak as well as an idol of Farinelli, is somehow something apart. His famous self is its own autonomous being. Such a fission between person and persona is a divide with which Philippe can well identify. Photo Iestyn Davies, left, provides the singing alter ego of the character Farinelli, while Sam Crane fills the acting role. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Or as the King says to his loving and sorely tried wife, Isabella (a warm and centered Melody Grove), “Everything produced in this world has its shadow even at the beginning; when we are taken from the safety of the dark then are we no longer wholly ourselves; we have been claimed by others.” That’s quite a mouthful, even for an un-self-edited monarch. I didn’t entirely absorb that speech’s implications about the nature of celebrity and identity when I first heard it. Ms. van Kampen, a composer and the founding director of theater music at Shakespeare’s Globe, is not by nature a playwright. The language of her script, which combines Shakespearean pastiche with Pirandellian philosophizing and latter-day jokiness, doesn’t always flow melodically. But Ms. van Kampen has an illuminating appreciation not only for period music but also for the gap between artists and their art, and what separates the nimbus of fame from those who are enhaloed by it. (She is married to Mr. Rylance, so she should know.) The physical production — directed by John Dove and designed by Jonathan Fensom — provides the ideal frame for such contemplation. The Belasco has been reimagined as a courtly theater with onstage seating for audience members, blurring the distinction between public and private performance. (That distinction will be further — and most charmingly — erased at the beginning of the second act.) Video This world is illuminated by the glow of candles, real and extrapolated (by the lighting designer Paul Russell), and a feeling of twilight reverie pervades every scene. The music that emanates from the onstage ensemble, performing on period instruments, matches the sense of a distant age burnished by memory. The look is “once upon a time” incarnate. When we first meet our storybook King, he is in bed, fishing in a goldfish bowl. As he converses — and, implicitly, identifies with — the confined creature in the bowl, he seems to belong to the species of charming lunatics who populate the whimsical works of French dramatists like Anouilh and Giraudoux. But the pain and anger beneath make this man a danger, even to those he loves. Philippe, the grandson of the grandest king of all, France’s Louis XIV, believes everyone is plotting to usurp him. (He’s not entirely wrong.) Those he suspects include his chief minister (Edward Peel, looking like a Hogarth caricature of a desiccated politician); the royal doctor (Huss Garbiya) and even the steadfast Isabella. It is she who introduces Farinelli, who is managed by a hapless English entrepreneur (Colin Hurley, in a classic comic man-of-the-theater turn), into the court. The King is not initially smitten by this human novelty. And then Farinelli sings. Isabella spoke earlier of being transported by the sound of that voice, and Mr. Davies, improbably, matches her account. That is crucial to our acceptance of the transformation the king will undergo. So is the sight of Mr. Rylance listening to Mr. Davies sing — “as if he is leaning in,” Farinelli marvels later, “to hear it more particularly.” In the paradoxically plaintive and joyous sound of a castrato’s voice channeling Handel’s music, the King has glimpsed a paradise beyond his fractious court and his burdened royal self. Trying to create that idyllic vision in the real world, in a rustic outpost in the forest in the second act, is an experiment doomed to failure. But watching Mr. Rylance’s Philippe experience Farinelli’s voice, we hear what we hears. And an actor and a singer temporarily turn a night at the theater in an anxious city into an Eden beyond worldly care, all the more precious for its evanescence.

JASON FARAGO,"If you want to see the true ethos of 1990s Manhattan, though, it’s the unrealized projects in “Millennium” that speak loudest. Along with Kaplan, the architect James Sanders proposed a retrofitting of Liberty Plaza Park (now Zuccotti Park, the site of the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011) that aimed to flush financial data out of the skyscrapers and onto the streets. An axonometric rendering here shows massive, Tokyo-style LED screens promoting GeoCities, Lycos and other children of the dot-com bubble, as well as a live broadcast from the stock exchange floor by a young Maria Bartiromo. Though never built, the Liberty Plaza project encapsulated a newly digitized, 24-hour economy; the architects even imagined that passers-by could buy and sell stock on their newfangled flip phones. Changes in financial technology also weighed upon the New York Stock Exchange, which made efforts to move from its colonnaded pile on Wall Street to a new tower to the south. The project, designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, would have necessitated the demolition of a clutch of historic buildings, and was canceled after the recession of 2001. A $125 million Museum of Women, intended for Battery Park City and greenlit by George E. Pataki, the former New York governor, was scrapped too. Photo An installation view of “Millennium: Lower Manhattan in the 1990s” at the Skyscraper Museum in Manhattan. The show focuses on the growth of Lower Manhattan’s residential and touristic appeal. Credit Charlie Rubin for The New York Times But the wildest and, from this distance, most ridiculous project of those heady days was a new Guggenheim Museum, a tangle of suspended metal ribbons designed by Frank Gehry in the delirious days after his Bilbao institution opened. The museum would have occupied three piers south of the Brooklyn Bridge. “He has raised the horizon of the water, in waves that lap against the base of the cliffs,” wrote Herbert Muschamp, who was then a free-associative architecture critic at The Times; others effused that Gehry’s titanium nimbus, four times the size of Frank Lloyd Wright’s uptown spiral, would rival the Statue of Liberty as a New York landmark. It now looks more like an unbuilt monument to the ego of Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim’s aggressive former director; it was shelved on New Year’s Eve 2002. Bracketing all the projects in this exhibition, it goes without saying, is the disaster that took place just a few blocks north of the Skyscraper Museum, and that transformed Lower Manhattan in an entirely different way. It was the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, that truly announced the start of a new millennium, and more than 16 years later, construction at the World Trade Center remains unfinished. What has arisen ranges from the sublime (Fumihiko Maki’s stark, precise 4 World Trade Center) to the scandalous (Santiago Calatrava’s chunky, billions-over-budget transit hub ), and a boom in residential real estate has been accompanied by the arrival of the same generic shops now found everywhere, from Harlem to Hell’s Kitchen. To look at the first blush of reconstruction down here in the 1990s is to grow nostalgic for a New York that moved at a different tempo. One of the first New Yorkers to move into the old commercial towers of 1990s Wall Street was my father, and when I was a teenager, I used to thrill to the hush of nighttime Lower Manhattan, its unlit canyons of steel not yet conquered by touch screens and organic grain bowls. I would look up at the Woolworth Building, at Trinity Church or at the two tallest buildings of all, Minoru Yamasaki’s unloved behemoths of aluminum and steel. There was a future dawning, but it had not arrived yet — and in those silent ’90s nights, I imagined a far more vigorous one than this.

Anton Shilov,"Nimbus Data on Monday introduced its new lineup of ultra-high capacity SSDs designed to compete against nearline HDDs in data centers. The ExaDrive DC drives use proprietary controllers and NAND flash in custom packaging to offer up to 100 TB of flash memory capacity in a standard 3.5-inch package. The SSDs use the SATA 6 Gbps interface and are rated for 'unlimited' endurance. The Nimbus ExaDrive DC lineup will consist of two models featuring 50 TB and 100 TB capacities, a 3.5-inch form-factor, and a SATA 6 Gbps interface. Over time the manufacturer expects to release DC-series SSDs with an SAS interface, but it is unclear when exactly such drives will be available. When it comes to performance, the Nimbus DC SSDs are rated for up to 500 MB/s sequential read/write speeds as well as up to 100K read/write random IOPS, concurrent with most SATA-based SSDs in this space. As for power consumption, the ExaDrive DC100 consumes 10 W in idle mode and up to 14 W in operating mode. The ExaDrive DC-series SSDs are based on Nimbus’ proprietary architecture, featuring four custom NAND controllers and a management processor. The drives use 3D MLC NAND flash memory made by SK Hynix in proprietary packaging. Nimbus does not disclose the ECC mechanism supported by the controllers, but keeping in mind that we are dealing with a 3D MLC-based device, it does not need a very strong ECC for maximum endurance. Speaking of endurance, it is worth noting that the 100 TB drive comes with an unlimited write endurance guarantee for the full five-year warranty period. This is not particularly surprising because it is impossible to write more than 43.2 TB of data per 24 hours at 500 MB/s, which equates to 43% of the 100TB drive. For those wondering, at that speed for five years comes to ~79 PB over the 5 year warranty of the drive (assuming constant writes at top speed for five years straight). The drives support end-to-end CRC as well, with UBER specified as &lt;1 bit per 10^17 bits read. The Nimbus ExaDrive DC SSDs come in industry-standard 3.5-inch form-factor and are compatible with numerous SATA backplanes capable of supporting drives with at least 14 W power consumption. In particular, Nimbus Data says that there are ""at least"" three vendors of 4U90 chassis with proper thermal and power characteristics to support ExaDrive DC drives and the company has already qualified them. Keeping in mind that not all ultra high density enclosures can support 14 W drives because of power and cooling requirements, the ExaDrive DCs are not drop-in compatible with every application that use 3.5-inch hard drives today. So, if a datacenter operator wants to replace some of its high capacity HDDs with ultra-high capacity SSDs and maximize its storage per square meter density, it will need to use appropriate enclosures. In fact, Nimbus plans to announce high-density reference designs with enclosure partners in the coming weeks, but the company does not elaborate. Nimbus Data ExaDrive DC Specifications 50 TB 100 TB Form Factor 3.5"" Interface SATA 6 Gbps Controller Four proprietary controller ASICs featuring a management processor NAND SK Hynix 3D MLC in proprietary packaging Sequential Read 500 MB/s Sequential Write 500 MB/s (= 43 TB/day) Random Read (4 KB) IOPS 100,000 Random Write (4 KB) IOPS 100,000 Power Idle 10 W Operating 14 W ECC unknown Endurance Unlimited DWPD for over five years (limited by performance) Uncorrectable Bit Error Rate &lt;1 bit per 10 17 bits read End-to-End Data Protection Yes Warranty Five years Power Loss Protection Yes Additional Information Link According to Nimbus, 40 million 3.5-inch nearline HDDs with an aggregate capacity of 250 million TBs were shipped in 2017. The company believes that 10% of newly sold nearline capacity will move to NAND flash within three years, which represents massive opportunities for high capacity SSDs like the ExaDrive DC. Nimbus has already begun sampling its DC-series SSDs with select customers. Commercial shipments are expected to begin this summer. Since Nimbus not only sells drives directly to its &gt;200 clients, but also makes them available through its partners like Viking or Smart, and we expect other brands to offer products similar with the ExaDrive DC in the future. So far no formal announcements have been made. The manufacturer does not disclose pricing of the ExaDrive DC50 and DC100 SSDs, but only says it will be competitive. Keep in mind that since NAND flash pricing tends to fluctuate, only time will tell actual MSRPs of the ExaDrive SSDs when they ship this summer.

Michael Burdick,"February 23, 2018 7 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. The enterprise as we know it is reinventing itself, all thanks to the phenomenon known as the gig economy. As automation forces workers to find new occupations, consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company believes as many as 800 million adults worldwide will need to find new ways to earn a living by 2030. Although some will simply change careers and land in new full-time roles, others will decide to explore the growing freelance marketplace. This shift is already underway in many sectors, with 72 percent of millennials telling the Intelligence Group that they prefer to be their own bosses. While this evolution of workplace dynamics might seem to diminish the traditional notion of the enterprise, it’s a positive change. Instead of fearing this shift, companies at the leading edge are embracing this transition to freelance labor. They appreciate the opportunity to engage with professionals who have specialized skill sets on specific projects, enabling them to use matchmaking algorithms to connect with the labor supply du jour. Related: Top 5 Ways Freelancers Can Stay Competitive in the Gig Economy Looking forward to a fluid corporate team From internet startups to global conglomerates, freelancers provide an incredible opportunity to outdo the competition. Foremost is the ability to cherry-pick the right people for the right job at the right time. Why pay someone to sit at a desk waiting for a chance to shine when you can instead divert that money toward people with relevant experiences and credentials? Contractors can come and go as needed, allowing organizations to staff up or down depending on their needs. The biotech space is rapidly shifting from full-timers to freelancers. For instance, Nimbus Therapeutics reports that only 25 of the more than 150 people it pays would identify as traditional employees -- the vast majority of Nimbus team members are freelance consultants. Other industries are sure to follow suit. Want more reasons to embrace the idea of farming out tasks to freelancers? Try increased cost-effectiveness and productivity. Because businesses only pay for hours worked and have complete control over hiring and firing, they’re able to quickly pivot if an approach proves ineffective. Plus, freelance workers usually have the experience necessary to hit the ground running on day one. While traditional enterprises won’t cease to exist in 20 years, they’re going to look radically different from today’s incarnations. Large corporations such as Procter &amp; Gamble, FedEx and Verizon are climbing aboard the contractor bandwagon, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that 20 to 50 percent of the workforce in these companies is outsourced. As matchmaking algorithms evolve and workers realize they can make more money freelancing than they might in full-time roles, the traditional walls of the enterprise are certain to crumble. This might sound like a perilous situation for established enterprises, but businesses should treat this growing contingency of freelance workers as an opportunity to improve rather than an existential threat. Related: Gig Economy Platforms Are Creating a New Class of Entrepreneurs Setting the groundwork to welcome freelancers Even if you’ve already flirted with the idea of freelance hires, it’s time to commit to the trend. The best way to make any change is by following a well-conceived plan. Here’s yours: 1. Break projects down into digestible pieces. Instead of looking at the big picture, find ways to break tasks down into smaller chunks. You can then work to find the right skill set for the task at hand -- even if that means dividing and conquering. Considering that a PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that 72 percent of CEOs are concerned about the availability of key skills in workers, it’s sometimes easier to farm out elements of a larger project than it is to find one person who can handle everything. Let’s say your health sciences firm wants to farm out a blog post about a fairly technical concept in your industry. While a writer who has a background in health sciences would be ideal, you might struggle to find that combination of talents in a timely manner. Instead of waiting for one person with the perfect blend of skills, you could enlist a health sciences expert to provide the material and hire a skilled writer to translate that content into a compelling blog post. It all boils down to understanding your needs. By plotting out exactly what has to happen and being flexible as to who will handle various tasks, you’ll be able to find the right combination of workers for any project. 2. Set up a virtual workflow that uses modern tools. Communication must always play a guiding role when working with freelancers. Without clear, consistent communication, projects can go askew. Avoid setbacks by establishing explicit expectations and using technology to create open lines of communication with freelance team members. This could include messaging platforms and videoconferences, which you can record and retain in your system for future reference. A study by TECHnalysis Research suggests that 75 percent of workplace communication takes place via email and phone. These tried-and-true channels are by no means obsolete, but you could lose essential information to push projects forward if you don't house it all in one centralized system. Make it easy to have an audit trail and document storage clearinghouse by using platforms such as Slack or Trello. Related: Workers Without Borders: Managing the Remote Revolution 3. Leverage freelancers' expertise to boost your business. Mental Health America reports that disengaged employees cost corporations at least $450 billion annually. To make matters worse, a study by EmployeeChannel claims a mere 16 percent of workers feel engaged. These are serious problems, but they represent a tremendous opportunity for your business to find ways to truly engage full-timers and freelancers alike. Integrate freelancers into your team, and encourage them to share their outside perspectives. They have likely learned valuable lessons in roles with other organizations, so find ways to capitalize on that wealth of knowledge. More importantly, give them credit when you put their ideas into action. 4. Find freelance marketplaces that best serve your needs. Freelance marketplaces can connect you with gig workers within hours. According to an article in Time, a sizable number of freelancers who use the internet to drum up work are able to find suitable projects in as little as 24 hours. The caveat for your organization is that you must find a marketplace you fully trust. Many sites do not vet their freelancers, which means you’re stuck combing through ratings and endorsements from clients whose needs might not match your own. Try a few different marketplaces, as one single platform isn't likely to solve all your hiring needs. To make things easier, identify marketplaces that specialize in the roles you need: For instance, you might consider Gigster for app development, 99designs for graphic design work or Paro for help with finances. The American enterprise is living on borrowed time, but there's no reason to panic. The Industrial Revolution completely changed the way people work and companies operate, but that dramatic shift was a net gain for everyone involved. The ongoing freelance revolution is likely to have a similar effect on the business world. Instead of fearing the structural changes on the horizon thanks to this shift in how we work, business leaders should seize the opportunity to get ahead of the curve by embracing freelance workers.","The American enterprise is living on borrowed time, but there's no reason to panic.

John Aldred,"The storage space race never seems to end. With ever-increasing storage demands on both consumers and storage facilities, it’s not surprising. We’re creating more digital content than ever before. Whether it’s text, photos or videos. Now, Nimbus Data have beaten out Seagate’s 60TB proof-of-concept SSD and completely annihilated Samsung’s recent 30TB SSD announcement. Aimed more at data centres than home users, Nimbus Data has announced the ExaDrive, which holds a ridiculous 100TB of data. Unlike the 2.5″ Samsung, the ExaDrive comes in a 3.5″ SATA form factor to make it fit better with server and rack size standards. The company says that the ExaDrive DC100 is “optimized for capacity and efficiency”. 100TB is a hell of a lot of space. Nimbus Data say that it’s around 20 million songs, 20,000 HD movies or 2,000 iPhones worth of data. a Single rack of DC100 SSDs in a data centre can reach over 100 petabytes of capacity. But the benefit isn’t just that they can store more. It’s power efficiency, too. If a data centre can store a petabyte on 10 drives instead of 50 or 100 drives, that’s much lower energy consumption. With power usage at 0.1 watts per TB, it’s extremely efficient. Nimbus Data claim that over a 5 year period it will cost 42% less per terabyte over existing enterprise SSDs. The ExaDrive DC series contains drives two drives in 100TB And 50TB flavours. The drive is currently sampling with select customers and will go on general sale in Summer 2018. There’s no word on price yet, but I imagine it will be out of the range of most consumers. You can find out more on the Nimbus Data website. It would be nice, though.

Ethan Gach,"The first ever Smash Ultimate Summit is here. After years of success in bringing its collective weirdness to Super Smash Bros. Melee, Beyond the Summit is finally launching its hybrid esports tournament format, complete with casual couch banter and comedy sketches, for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
Invited players include the likes of MkLeo, ZeRo, Mew2King, and Leffen. Others, like Mang0, were voted in by fans. There will be one notable absence: Gavin Tweek Dempsey. While not as much of a household name as some Smash players, hes established himself as one of the best Smash Ultimate players currently competing after taking first place at Frostbite 2019 in a tough two-set series against Leonardo MkLeo Lopez Perez.
Tweek didnt campaign for a vote-in spot, however, and didnt get a direct invite. He also failed to snag one of the remaining spots by winning last weekends Ultimate Nimbus tournament. While the event boasts booze and gags with an eye toward entertaining the audience back home and generating the next wave of Smash memes, the roughly $50,000 prize pool means the competition will be stiff.
Crew battles are tonight, followed by singles pools on Saturday at 1:00 a.m. Eastern, followed by more shenanigans that night, including a commentator crew battle. The final bracket will get underway on Sunday at 1:00 p.m. The entire thing will be streamed live on Beyond the Summits Twitch channel.
The second season of Overwatch League is in its fourth week. Paris Eternal takes on the Vancouver Titans tonight at 8:30 p.m. Eastern, while on Saturday, things kick off at 3:00 p.m. with Los Angeles Valiant, who will be looking for their first win of the season against the Houston Outlaws. The full schedule is available on the OWL website, with matches streaming on the Play Overwatch Twitch channel.
You can also catch Saturday Fight Night live on NBC right after Saturday Night Live ends at 1:00 a.m. Itll be North vs. South in Street Fighter V, as Californias best players duke it out in a Los Angeles-based open tournament.

Mark Wilson,"My old trick was 2.08 line spacing. It was the perfect way to nudge an essay that critical half page longer to meet a teacher’s requirements. But you, young student, have it better than I did. Because you have legal weed in many states. And also, you now have access to the perfect cheater font: Times Newer Roman. Developed as a highly polished joke by the digital agency MSCHF, Times Newer Roman is a freely downloadable, subtly stretched makeover of the typeface we all know, designed to run about 5%-10% wider than the classic Times New Roman. “We had to go in character by character, widening specific letters that made sense along the x-axis, while also making sure that we maintained the proper stroke width and curve modeling,” explains Gabe Whaley, founder and CEO of MSCHF. “It can’t look like we just stretched characters, because that would be very obvious in the end.” [Image: MSCHF] Technically, the team started with a Times New Roman clone called Nimbus Roman No. 9 (no doubt for licensing issues). Modifying it was a process that took two weeks to get just right; it required finding the balance between a font that’s wide enough to make a tangible difference in an assignment, but not so wide that the casual observer could possibly spot the difference. The final product looks amazing, though–the equivalent prank to a master sculptor shaping fake vomit. It had already been downloaded over 500 times shortly after its launch on Tuesday, and for good reason. If you’re writing a 15-page, single spaced document, Times Newer Roman saves you almost 1,000 words getting there. “Brevity is the soul of wit,” says Whaley. “Write less and choose your words wisely.”","Put that double space down, there’s a new way to pad your school essays.

Matt Weinberger,"Back in 2016, ""Pokémon Go"" became a veritable cultural phenomenon, getting people all over the world to leave their homes and join a global Pokémon journey. 
 Now, developer Niantic is looking to repeat this magic trick with ""Harry Potter: Wizards Unite,"" a long-promised and long-teased game for iPhone and Android that brings players into JK Rowling's famed Wizarding World, developed in conjunction with WB Games and its Portkey Games label. 
 Niantic isn't quite ready to announce a formal release date for ""Wizards Unite,"" other than that it'll be out some time this year. But last week, Niantic allowed me and several other members of the press to go hands-on with the game, giving us our first real look. 
 I came away impressed — while the game is superficially similar to ""Pokémon Go,"" it brings lots of intriguing and promising changes to the mix that could prove to be, ahem, magical. 
 Welcome to the Wizarding World 
 The basic premise of the game: Years after the events of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" someone (or something) has broken the time-space continuum, scattering magical artifacts and creatures all over the world. It's the player's job to help clean up the mess before non-magical Muggles realize that there are wizards in our midst, with a fully voice-acted plot featuring appearances from Harry Potter and Hermoine Granger. 
One encounter will require you to ward off a Dementor with the Expecto Patronum spell.
 Niantic 
In practice, this means walking around the real world, hunting for so-called ""foundables"" like the Nimbus 2000 broom, the Sorting Hat, and even time-displaced versions of Harry and his friends taken from the books. Your magical mission, should you choose to accept it, is to complete your collection of returned ""foundables."" 
 It's not that easy, though, as each ""foundable"" comes with a corresponding ""confoundable"" that you'll have to defeat with a spell. You might need to cast Alohamora to unlock the shackles keeping Buckbeak the Hippogriff on the ground, or the mighty Expecto Patronum to ward off a Dementor threatening Harry Potter. 
 Actual spellcasting is a matter of swiping on the screen in line with a pattern; you're graded based on how fast and how accurately you trace that line. Every encounter is given a difficulty level, which determines how good your spellcasting has to be to defeat the confoundable and add another entry in your registry of foundables. 
 There's combat, too, requiring players to successfully defend themselves with the Protego spell while waiting for their chance to strike back with a counterspell of their own. 
 The idea, Niantic says, is to evoke the fast-paced feeling of magical combat in the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Fantastic Beasts"" film franchises. In my brief experience with the game, this bears through — I won and lost duels with werewolves and dark wizards in fun and surprisingly challenging short battles. 
 More than just another Pokémon 
 So, yeah, there's clearly some overlap with ""Pokémon Go."" It even uses Niantic's same database of local points of interest to populate its world — meaning that the same real world locations that were important in ""Pokémon Go"" will be important in ""Wizards Unite."" Which is to say, when you first open the game, it looks a lot like ""Pokémon Go."" 
 But in this universe, rather than gathering Poké Balls at PokéStops, you'll be stopping along the way at inns, which will gift you a selection of very British food to choose from, including fish and chips and mince pies. Eating at these inns is how you restore your wizarding energy, allowing you to keep playing. 
Some areas will have special properties, like attracting more magical creatures.
 Niantic 
Intriguingly, though, Niantic is promising that the world of ""Wizards Unite"" will be populated by all kinds of other establishments. For instance, greenhouses will grant rare potion ingredients, while landmarks — tied to real-world tourist destinations — will offer unique types of gameplay, though Niantic is staying mum on details. 
 Towering above all of these locations — literally — are the fortresses, where players can team up and take on combat challenges. Each fortress has a number of different challenges, at different skill levels, so newbies and veteran wizards alike can fight worthy foes. 
 On the subject of potions, players will encounter magical plants and other assorted flora all over the world. Niantic says that it's tying these flora to factors like the weather and temperature in the real world: Some plants might only bloom in the morning, and others only when it's cold and rainy. 
 Niantic says that there's going to be more to all of this, as well. It promises that players will be able to choose a ""profession,"" like professor or evil-hunting Auror, that will grant advantages when setting out to accomplish certain tasks. And that's not to mention the fact that players will be sorted into Hogwarts houses, which Niantic hints will open up new social features. 
 Ultimately, all of this means that ""Wizards Unite"" takes a lot of the systems and concepts first introduced in ""Pokémon Go"" to the next level. 
 Much more than a mere rehash, my brief time with the game hints that ""Wizards Unite"" could have a surprising amount of depth all its own. The challenge will be to balance that complexity with the simplicity and excitement of running around the real world looking for runaway broomsticks. 
 Augmented wizarding reality 
 On a final note, ""Wizards Unite"" is definitely the purest example yet of Niantic's big bet on augmented reality, the technology for overlaying digital imagery over the real world. 
Read more: The CEO behind 'Pokémon Go' says the company is cash-flow positive as it becomes worth almost $4 billion
Portkeys will instantly transport you across the globe making for a nifty augmented reality minigame where you're whisked away to a location from the books and movies.
 Niantic 
Every single encounter with a foundable or an enemy is playable in an optional (but recommended) AR mode. It goes a step beyond what's in ""Pokémon Go"" by rendering every AR scene in three dimensions, so you can walk around and inspect the iceberg that's keeping the Nimbus 2000 broomstick trapped, or get up close and personal with a troll. 
 There are other neat AR effects, too, like the ability to apply Snapchat-style AR stickers and filters — all Potter-themed, of course — when you take a selfie for your player profile. 
 Another nifty innovation is the ability to collect Portkeys, which, in the Wizarding World, instantly teleport the user across even vast distances. In ""Wizards Unite,"" that translates to a cool AR mode, where you get to explore locations from the films in great detail by waving your phone around. In my demo, I visited Ollivander's wand shop. 
 In theory, these AR modes promise to create all kinds of neat, immersive effects that really bring you into the game's world. Indeed, I was struck by the elegance and effectiveness of these AR illusions, reflecting what was clearly a great effort from Niantic and company. 
 In practice, it remains to be seen how many players will embrace these AR modes — speaking as an active, dedicated ""Pokémon Go"" player, it's both easier and more battery-effective to leave the AR switch toggled to off.","Niantic and WB Games have finally unveiled ""Harry Potter: Wizards Unite,"" their long-promised smartphone game that takes players into JK Rowling's Wizarding World.

noreply@blogger.com (Richard Byrne),"This week's news about Screencast-o-matic has prompted me to update my list of tools for creating screencast videos on Chromebooks. All of these tools can be used by you or your students to create demonstrations of how a tool works, to create a simple video lesson in which you talk over a slideshow, or to create video blog entry with the webcam in your Chromebook. For many years Screencast-o-matic has been my favorite tool for creating screencast videos on Windows and Mac computers. Now it is available to use on Chromebooks too. To use Screencast-o-Matic on a Chromebook just go to this page and click ""launch recorder."" You can record your screen or your screen and your webcam simultaneously. You can narrate your videos by using your Chromebook's built-in microphone or by using an external mic like a Blu Snowball. The free version of Screencast-o-matic will let you record for up to 15 minutes, record as many videos as you like, and save to your Google Drive or local drive. Loom is a free screencasting tool that works on Chromebooks, Macs, and Windows computers. Loom is a Chrome extension. With Loom installed you can record your desktop, an individual tab, and or your webcam. That means that you could use Loom to just record a webcam video on a Chromebook. Of course, this also means that you can use Loom to record your webcam while also recording your desktop. Loom recordings can be up to ten minutes long. A completed recording can be shared via social media and email. You can also download your recordings as MP4 files to upload to YouTube or any other video hosting service. Loom also has a neat integration with Gmail that makes it easy to send screencasts to anyone who emails you for tech help. Click here to see how that integration works. Vidyard GoVideo is a free Chrome extension that makes it quick and easy to create and share screencast videos. With the extension installed you can record your entire screen or just one window tab. Vidyard GoVideo will let you record yourself with your webcam too. The best part of Vidyard GoVideo is that you can track who watches your video. To record on Vidyard GoVideo you simply have to click the extension icon then choose what you want to record. When you're done recording your video is automatically stored on Vidyard GoVideo. From Vidyard GoVideo you can share your video via email and social media. If you choose to share via email, you will be able to track who watched your video. Nimbus Screenshot was my favorite tool on this list until Screencast-o-matic launched their Chromebook tool. I like Nimbus because of its ease of installation and it is the only tool on this list that provided a customizable countdown timer. I like the countdown timer because it gives me a few seconds to prepare to start talking over my screencast. The other tools just started recording the second that I hit the record button. Nimbus Screenshot was also the easiest to install and configure on my Chromebook. Screencasts recorded with Nimbus Screenshot can be saved to your local drive or to an online Nimbus account. I usually choose to save to my local drive then upload to my YouTube channel. You can also save to your local drive then send it to Google Drive or another online storage service. Screencastify probably has the most name recognition of the tools in this list. Despite a set-up process that can confuse some new users, it's a solid product. The free version limits recordings to ten minutes, puts a watermark on the recording, and doesn't support direct download to MP4. On the upside, there is an option to upload directly to YouTube and to share directly to Google Classroom. The sharing to Google Classroom feature is the one that most fans of Screencastify are quick to point out to me. CaptureCast lets you record your webcam while recording your screen which you cannot do with the Nimbus tool. You can choose to record your screen, your screen and your webcam, or just your screen or just your webcam. CaptureCast gives you three options for recording definition. So if you're on a slower network you can choose a lower resolution recording to save processing time. CaptureCast lets you save a recording locally or send it to YouTube or to Vimeo. Soapbox is a free tool from Wistia that makes it easy to create great screencast videos on a Chromebook or any computer that is using the Chrome web browser. With Soapbox installed in the Chrome web browser you can quickly record your screen and your webcam at the same time. The most distinguishing feature of Soapbox is that you can have your video transition from your screen to your webcam to a combination of the two. Soapbox includes some simple editing tools for zooming in on an area of your screen and calling attention to specific parts of your screen.","This week's news about Screencast-o-matic has prompted me to update my list of tools for creating screencast videos on Chromebooks.

Jonathon Ramsey,"Audi debuted the TT 20th Anniversary Edition at last year's Paris Motor Show. Now that dealerships have the celebratory coupe and roadster in stock, we're privy to pricing: $53,895 (including $995 for destination), and $57,795 for the droptop. Those numbers represent a $4,000 premium over the standard coupe, and an $8,000 surcharge over the standard roadster. Out of the 999 units Audi said it would build for global consumption, 80 will come to the U.S., split down the middle between the two body styles.To be clear, while Audi says the 20th anniversary cars are inspired by the TTS Roadster concept study shown at the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show, the twins commemorate the first model year of the TT coupe in 1999. A hardtop TT concept study had been shown before Tokyo at the 1995 Frankfurt Motor Show, said car entering production at the end of 1998. The roadster would appear a year later.
Whereas the rest of the world gets only Aviator Gray Pearl Metallic as an exterior color, the U.S. buyers also get a choice of Nimbus Gray Metallic. According to Car and Driver, historical accuracy would suggest buying the coupe in Aviator Gray and the convertible in Nimbus Gray.
All interiors come in Moccasin Brown Fine Nappa leather with custom yellow stitching, an echo of the ""Baseball"" interior that wowed design enthusiasts on the first generation. Some of the included options are the S Sport seats and steering wheel, and Technology package, which bundles the Audi virtual cockpit, MMI navigation plus, Audi smartphone integration, Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo, and Audi side assist. A plaque inside will be printed with the car's serial number, making each example truly one-of-one.
High-gloss black trim keys the exterior, along with ""20 Years of TT"" badges on the front fenders, matte Audi rings on the rear fenders, OLED taillights nabbed off the TT RS, trumpet-style exhaust tips, and exclusive 19 inch, 5-spoke, gunmetal wheels on summer tires. The engine remains the same 2.0 liter four-cylinder turbo with 228 horsepower as the standard car, shifting through a seven-speed S-tronic dual-clutch gearbox.

Michael Zhang,"It seems the competition for the title of “world’s highest capacity SSD” is heating up. Just a month after Samsung announced an industry-leading 30TB SSD, the bar has just been raised over three times higher. The company Nimbus Data has unveiled a monstrous 100TB SSD. The new “ExaDrive DC series raises the bar in SSD power efficiency, density, and write endurance,” Nimbus says, and the ExaDrive DC100 boasts over three times the capacity of the nearest competitor on the market. Despite its hefty storage capacity, the ExaDrive DC100 also claims to be the world’s most efficient SSD, drawing 85% less power per terabyte (0.1 watts/TB) compared to competitors. Nimbus says this translates to a 42% reduction in the cost of ownership per terabyte. The drive has enough “capacity to store 20 million songs, 20,000 HD movies, or 2,000 iPhones worth of data in a device small enough to fit in your back pocket,” Nimbus says. In photographic terms, the ExaDrive DC100 can store 2 million RAW photos that weigh 50MB each. Compatibility-wise, the ExaDrive DC100 features the same 3.5″ form factor and SATA interface used by standard hard drives, allowing you to easily install it in a plug-and-play manner. In the area of longevity, the ExaDrive DC100 has a mean time between failures (MTBF) of 2.5 million hours, or over 285 years. Like with all other SSDs in this capacity range, the ExaDrive DC100 is geared toward industrial applications such as datacenter racks, but Nimbus does say “digital imaging” is one of the prime uses. The ExaDrive DC100 will be available in the summer of 2018. While pricing has yet to be announced, Nimbus has revealed that the drive will be “similar to existing enterprise SSDs on a per terabyte basis.” In other words, it’ll only cost you tens of thousands of dollars to buy one.

noreply@blogger.com (Richard Byrne),"With the addition of Screencast-O-Matic there are now seven tools that teachers and students can use to create screencast videos on their Chromebooks. If you missed yesterday's news, Screencast-O-Matic is currently offering a public beta of their Chrome app. To use Screencast-O-Matic on your Chromebook you will need to go to this page while on your Chromebook, click launch recorder, install the Chrome app when prompted, and then start recording your screen. Screencast-O-Matic on a Chromebook will let you record for up to fifteen minutes per video. You can include your own narration as well as sounds from your Chromebook in your screencasts. Completed videos can be saved to Chromebook or saved directly to Google Drive. Loom is a free screencasting tool that works on Chromebooks, Macs, and Windows computers. Loom is a Chrome extension. With Loom installed you can record your desktop, an individual tab, and or your webcam. That means that you could use Loom to just record a webcam video on a Chromebook. Of course, this also means that you can use Loom to record your webcam while also recording your desktop. Loom recordings can be up to ten minutes long. A completed recording can be shared via social media and email. You can also download your recordings as MP4 files to upload to YouTube or any other video hosting service. Soapbox is a free tool from Wistia that makes it easy to create great screencast videos on a Chromebook or any computer that is using the Chrome web browser. With Soapbox installed in the Chrome web browser you can quickly record your screen and your webcam at the same time. The most distinguishing feature of Soapbox is that you can have your video transition from your screen to your webcam to a combination of the two. Soapbox includes some simple editing tools for zooming in on an area of your screen and calling attention to specific parts of your screen. ViewedIt is a free Chrome extension that makes it quick and easy to create and share screencast videos. With the extension installed you can record your entire screen or just one window tab. ViewedIt will let you record yourself with your webcam too. The best part of ViewedIt is that you can track who watches your video. To record on ViewedIt you simply have to click the extension icon then choose what you want to record. When you're done recording your video is automatically stored on ViewedIt. From ViewedIt you can share your video via email and social media. If you choose to share via email, you will be able to track who watched your video. Nimbus Screenshot is my favorite tool on this list because of its ease of installation and it is the only tool on this list that provided a customizable countdown timer. I like the countdown timer because it gives me a few seconds to prepare to start talking over my screencast. The other tools just started recording the second that I hit the record button. Nimbus Screenshot was also the easiest to install and configure on my Chromebook. Screencasts recorded with Nimbus Screenshot can be saved to your local drive or to an online Nimbus account. I usually choose to save to my local drive then upload to my YouTube channel. You can also save to your local drive then send it to Google Drive or another online storage service. CaptureCast lets you record your webcam while recording your screen which you cannot do with the Nimbus tool. You can choose to record your screen, your screen and your webcam, or just your screen or just your webcam. CaptureCast gives you three options for recording definition. So if you're on a slower network you can choose a lower resolution recording to save processing time. CaptureCast lets you save a recording locally or send it to YouTube or to Vimeo. Screencastify might have the most name recognition in this list, but I don't like it as much as some other tech bloggers like it. The set-up process asks a lot questions that could confuse new users. The free version limits recordings to ten minutes and puts a watermark on the recording. On the upside, there is an option to upload directly to YouTube.","With the addition of Screencast-O-Matic there are now seven tools that teachers and students can use to create screencast videos on their Chromebooks.

Anton Shilov,"The USB Type-C interface yet has to become as ubiquitous as USB Type-A, but as there are laptops that only have USB-C ports, a number of manufacturers already produce flash cards with dual (or even triple) interfaces. Silicon Power appears to be the first maker to produce a microSD card reader that has two interfaces and therefore supporting a host of various devices. In addition, the company is prepping several USB-C peripherals, such as dongles and docks. Silicon Power’s USB Type-A/USB Type-A microSD card reader supports microSDXC cards, up to 5 Gbps bandwidth as well as OTG capability that makes the device compatible with various mobile gadgets in addition to regular computers. Given the fact that microSDXC cards are available in capacities up to 512 GB, Silicon Power’s card reader may be used to build a high-capacity miniature external storage device for a MacBook/MacBook Pro. Obviously, such storage device will be rather expensive, but it will very small and compatible with both new and legacy PCs. In addition to the universal USB-A/USB-C microSD card reader, Silicon Power has two USB-C dongles and two docking stations. All of Silicon Power’s USB Type-C products feature USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) interface, which emphasizes their positioning: miniature MacBook notebooks as well as various inexpensive laptops that do not support USB 3.1 Gen 2 transfer rate (10 Gbps). Silicon Power’s lineup of USB-C devices includes Nimbus (D-Sub/VGA) and Focus (HDMI 1.4, so, up to 4Kp30) display dongles as well as Magnus and Stratus docking stations (check out their specs below). The more expensive Magnus supports power delivery, so it can be used to charge laptops during usage (important for MacBooks that only have one USB-C port used for data and power), whereas the Stratus will be able to boast with a competitive price that Silicon Power is known for. Silicon Power will release its USB-C devices in the coming months, so stay tuned for more details regarding prices and launch dates.

Jeff Benjamin,"Next week Valve is bringing its Steam Link app to iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. Steam Link will allow users on the aforementioned devices to stream their Steam game libraries while connected to a host system (Mac or PC) via a 5GHz network or wired Ethernet connection. Valve reports that Steam Link will support both MFi controllers like the SteelSeries Nimbus, along with its own Steam Controller. In preparation for next week’s launch, Steam has enabled Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity for its controller via the Steam Client Beta. It means that users can now connect their Steam Controllers directly to eligible devices, bypassing the need for its USB wireless receiver. Although using the USB wireless receiver has connectivity advantages, Valve highlights a number of reasons why users might want to employ the use of the Steam Controller’s direct Bluetooth LE connection. These reasons include the following: Streaming games to your iOS and Android devices with the Steam Link app. Connecting your Steam Controller to a tablet or laptop without a USB port. You just can’t find your Steam Controller Wireless Receiver. In the case of many iOS users, the first reason is the most obvious. Once the Steam Link app launches, this update will allow users to control games streamed from a Steam-enabled computer via the Steam Controller. The update bypasses the need for the wireless receiver, paving the way for iOS connectivity The Steam Controller is a polarizing piece of hardware, as users tend to either love or hate the way it meshes touch-based pointer input with a traditional console controller layout. But for those of us who prefer the Steam Controller and its wide array of customization options, this is welcomed news. In all other situations, Valve recommends sticking to the Steam Controller’s USB wireless receiver. The wireless receiver provides less latency, supports multiple simultaneous controllers, and was essentially built from the ground up to ensure a rock-solid connection. How to enable Bluetooth Low Energy on the Steam Controller Step 1: Launch Steam. Step 2: In menu bar click Steam → Preferences. Step 3: In the Accounts section of Steam Preferences, Click the Change button under the Beta participation heading. Step 4: On the Beta Participation pop-up use the drop-down box to select Steam Beta Update and click OK. Step 5: When prompted, click Restart to restart Steam. This will download and install the Steam Beta prior to relaunching the app. Step 6: Connect your Steam Controller to your Mac using a USB cable and click here to start the firmware update flow. Once you’re all connected, you can dynamically switch between the Steam Controller’s available wireless modes by using the following special button combinations upon controller power-up: After enabling Bluetooth LE Pairing Mode on the Steam Controller, you can go through the normal iOS Bluetooth pairing process to connect the controller to an eligible iPhone, iPad or Apple TV. I was able to successfully connect the Steam Controller to my iPad, as seen in the screenshot below: Of course, seeing as it’s not MFi-enabled, a Steam Controller/iOS combo isn’t very useful until Valve launches the Steam Link app next week. After that, you’ll be able to control Steam titles streamed from your desktop computer via the Steam Controller. The Steam Controller is one of the most unique controllers that I’ve ever used We’ll be sure to follow up with a test play-through to see how well Steam Link and the Steam Controller work once the app launches next week. Do you currently own a Steam Controller? Are you excited about the upcoming Steam Link app?

Ethan Gach,"Pew pew. We’re about a month out from The Last Jedi, which Disney is apparently so thrilled about they’ve decided to give director Rian Johnson his very own Star Wars trilogy to do what he will with. Until then there’s Star Wars Battlefront 2, the first game since Disney purchased the license to feature a true single-player story campaign. The micotransactions might be a mess at the moment, but the pull of a new drama set in a galaxy far, far away told through the barrel of a blaster rifle is hard to pass up. If you do pass it up though, might I recommend VA-11 HALL-A ? The cyberpunk visual novel hits the Vita this month proving that Sony’s handheld still has at least one thing Nintendo’s Switch hasn’t got.

Michael Potuck,"At this point, there’s not many platforms that the battle royale phenomenon hasn’t landed on. Fortnite is available on PC/Mac, the major consoles, iOS and now Android this month. However, one device that doesn’t support it is Apple TV, but that could be changing soon. As discovered by @StormLeaks, tvOS was found in Fortnite’s code, alongside references to the other platforms it’s available on. While Fornite on iOS has been a huge success, creating $100M in revenue in just three months, the majority of players prefer to battle on a big screen with a dedicated controller, or keyboard and mouse. Apple TV support along with a console-style controller like the SteelSeries Nimbus could prove to be a popular way to entice even more people to try out the hit game, or move players who started on iOS to switch to the set top box. Notably, Samsung announced a short exclusive Fortnite launch for its smartphones during the Note 9 release before its broader Android release. Maybe Apple and Epic Games could have an Apple TV/Fortnite announcement planned for next month’s iPhone event ? While $100M revenue on iOS is impressive, last month we heard that the game’s in-app purchases generated over $1 billion across all platforms. Developer, Epic Games is also continuing to expand the franchise with a partnership with Funko to create Fortnite collectibles. The collection is expected to include the game’s characters as Funko Pop’s popular big-head figures, keychain accessories, and more.

Vijay Seshadri,"Audio: Read by the author.
The forces out to kill us with their benevolenceare more crazed now than they were when you were alive.And more focussed, too. Our ingratitude excites them.Theyre bubbling with remedies.Their providential impulses are a nimbus of knives.Their need to tell us they love us, love us,with all their love in vain . . .
You said before you died that this would happen.Thanks for the warning. You didnt let me know, though,that even our phantom selves would come after us,crawling out of the poems we made.They dont care about the transparent skin we wrapped them inso they could watch their organs pulsing within.All they know is that we made their eyes too bright.They see more than they can stand,more than we ever could or would. They see the unending savagerythat we could never really bear to see,and so we consigned our sight to them.They hate us for it. Theyve cut the phone lines,and are chainsawing the front door.
Im a little worried about myself becauseall this hostility from every quarter bothers memuch less than it should. Why the disconnect? I cant figure it out.And its long past time to take precautions.The great wave that breaks through the crust of the worldis rising and rising and lifting me far inland,only to suck me back and drop me dangling by one armon the edge of the half-eaten cliff.I wont let myself fall, but I dont want to pull myself up.Im ambivalent. Im ambivalent forever now.But if you were here, looking down on me and saying,Grab my hand, grab my hand, I would, I know, I surely would.",Poetry by Vijay Seshadri: “You said before you died that this would happen. / Thanks for the warning.”,2019-01-14T10:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Newyorker.com'}","“Cliffhanging,” by Vijay Seshadri",https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/21/cliffhanging,,,Newyorker.com,nimbus,1
Jeremy Korzeniewski,"Auction house Bonhams teams with Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum in early October to find new owners for a slew of interesting motorcycles and memorabilia. Included will be several vintage bikes owned by the likes of Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda. A 1968 Bultaco Pursang 250 that was ridden by Hopper in the opening scene of Easy Rider seems likely to fetch a good deal of money, as does the 1967 CZ 250 that Newman rode in Sometimes a Great Notion. A few motorcycles owned by McQueen are also noteworthy, including the 1970 Husqvarna 400 Cross that the actor famously rode in On Any Sunday, a 1953 Vincent Comet Series C, and a 1939 Nimbus Model C Luxus complete with a sidecar. Not all of the classic two-wheelers on auction actually appeared on the silver screen. Still, the (claimed) oldest original Vincent Black Shadow in existence is sure to attract plenty of attention with a pre-bid estimate of between $400,000 and $500,000. And although it may not be all that well-known even among motorcyclists, this 1928 Windhoff 746cc Four that's up for auction may be the most stunning of all.

noreply@blogger.com (Richard Byrne),"Recording screencasts is one relatively easy way to get started making videos in your classroom. Today, I helped some middle school students make screencasts in which they explained the animations they made to represent forms of energy. Those students used Screencastify on their Chromebooks to make their videos. But Screencastify isn't the only screencasting tool that will work on a Chromebook. Here are eight tools that can be used to create screencasts on Chromebooks. Screencastify was one of the first screencasting tools made for Chromebooks. It's a solid product and is easy to use. You can record your screen, your screen and your webcam, just your screen, or just your webcam. The free version puts a watermark on the recording and doesn't support direct download to MP4. On the upside, there is an option to upload directly to YouTube, to save directly to Google Drive, and to share directly to Google Classroom. For many years Screencast-o-matic has been my favorite tool for creating screencast videos on Windows and Mac computers. Now it is available to use on Chromebooks too. To use Screencast-o-Matic on a Chromebook just go to this page and click ""launch recorder."" You can record your screen or your screen and your webcam simultaneously. You can narrate your videos by using your Chromebook's built-in microphone or by using an external mic like a Blue Snowball. The free version of Screencast-o-matic will let you record for up to 15 minutes, record as many videos as you like, and save to your Google Drive or local drive. Padlet is known as a digital corkboard to which students add notes, links, pictures, and videos. But ff you install Padlet's Chrome extension you can launch a screen recording tool directly from a Padlet note. You can record your screen and voice for up to five minutes. Your recording will be automatically added to your note when stop your recording. Loom is a free screencasting tool that works on Chromebooks, Macs, and Windows computers. Loom is a Chrome extension. With Loom installed you can record your desktop, an individual tab, and or your webcam. That means that you could use Loom to just record a webcam video on a Chromebook. Of course, this also means that you can use Loom to record your webcam while also recording your desktop. Loom recordings can be up to ten minutes long.

Loom also has a neat integration with Gmail that makes it easy to send screencasts to anyone who emails you for tech help. Click here to see how that integration works. Vidyard GoVideo is a free Chrome extension that makes it quick and easy to create and share screencast videos. With the extension installed you can record your entire screen or just one window tab. Vidyard GoVideo will let you record yourself with your webcam too. The best part of Vidyard GoVideo is that you can track who watches your video.

Mike Sounders,"Give me that hot mecha action If you thought that you had heard of Project Nimbus before, that wouldn't be wrong. The title was funded via Kickstarter, and prior to its final release was in Early Access on Steam. Last November the game launched in Japan for the PlayStation 4, gaining the name Project Nimbus: Code Mirai in the process. Today developer GameCrafterTeam, alongside publishers KISS Publishing and GameTomo, announced the PS4 version would be launching on April 10 in North America and April 11 in Europe. You can check out the launch trailer below. While I have not played the original PC release yet, it is part of the eternal hell known as the Steam backlog. After seeing the trailer I definitely want to install it and give it a go, as the gameplay in the trailer reminds me of Zone of the Enders. I just hope my aging rig can run it at a stable frame rate, as a game like this only deserves the best. Given that my collection of mech games is on my PlayStation 4 though, I may just double dip to keep them all together. You are logged out.

AppleInsider,"Jaybird on Tuesday announced the Tarah, its latest set of Bluetooth sport headphones, designed to provide a less expensive alternative to the likes of the Run or X4. The Tarah in fact uses a very similar design to the X4, including its remote, cinch, and tips, as well as earfins that keep the buds in place. They're IPX7-rated against sweat and rain, and owners can also customize their EQ settings by way of Jaybird's iPhone app. There are differences however. Above all, the Tarah gets only 6 hours of battery life per charge, versus 8 for the X4. Jaybird does promise that 10 minutes of charging is enough to provide 1 hour of playback. The remote can used to trigger either Siri or Google Assistant, depending on the connected phone. The Tarah is currently available through Jaybird's website for $99.99, in ""black/flash,"" ""nimbus gray/jade,"" and ""solstice blue/glacier"" color combinations. Other U.S. and Canadian sales are set to start in October, though the only third-party retailer to get solstice blue/glacier will be Best Buy.","Jaybird on Tuesday announced the Tarah, its latest set of Bluetooth sport headphones, designed to provide a less expensive alternative to the likes of the Run or X4.",2018-09-25T13:58:57Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Appleinsider.com'}",Jaybird launches lower-cost Tarah sport earbuds with features like fast charging,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/25/jaybird-launches-lower-cost-tarah-sport-earbuds-with-features-like-fast-charging,https://apple.insidercdn.com/gallery/27778-41988-jaybird-tarah-3-xl.jpg,,Appleinsider.com,nimbus,1
Hayato Huseman,"In case you missed it, Motorola just announced a handful of new low-cost devices for its wildly popular Moto G and Moto E series that finally look as nice as they perform, with rounded glass backings and dual cameras galore! The highest-end of all the phones announced was the Moto G6 Plus, which replaces last year's Moto G5 Plus in Motorola's powerful budget lineup. The G6 Plus isn't going to be available in the U.S. — stateside customers will want to look at the smaller Moto G6 instead — but that doesn't mean it's out of the question for the rest of the world, with the G6 Plus launching in Brazil, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. So how does this new affordable powerhouse stack up to last year's top dog? Specifications Before comparing the value of the Moto G6 Plus's newer features against where the Moto G5 Plus still holds its own, it's good to have an understanding of how the two differ in specs. Category Moto G6 Plus Moto G5 Plus Operating System Android 8.0 Oreo Android 7.0 Nougat Display 5.9-inch 18:9 IPS LCD display 2160 x 1080, 409PPI pixel density 5.2-inch 16:9 IPS LCD display 1920 x 1080, 424PPI pixel density Chipset Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 630, eight 2.2GHz Cortex A53 cores Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, eight 2.0GHz Cortex A53 cores GPU Adreno 508 Adreno 506 RAM 4GB/6GB 2GB/3GB/4GB Storage 64GB 32GB/64GB Expandable Yes (Micro-SD slot) Yes (Micro-SD slot) Battery 3200mAh 3000mAh Water resistance p2i water-repellent p2i water-repellent Rear Camera 12MP f/1.7 + 5MP f/1.7, Dual Pixel PDAF, 4K at 30fps 12MP f/1.7, Dual Pixel PDAF, 4K at 30fps Front Camera 8MP f/2.2, 1080p video 5MP f/2.2, 1080p video Connectivity WiFi ac, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, GLONASS, USB-C WiFi n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, GLONASS, Micro-USB Security Fingerprint sensor (front), face unlock Fingerprint sensor (front) SIM Single or Dual Nano SIM Single or Dual Nano SIM Dimensions 160 x 75.5 x 8.0mm 150.2 x 74 x 7.7mm Weight 167g 155g Colors Deep Indigo, Nimbus Lunar Gray, Fine Gold What's new with the Moto G6 Plus? The Moto G6 Plus brings a lot of new features to the table, including a complete redesign that's more akin to the Moto X4 than other Moto Gs before it. In addition to the rounded glass back, the fingerprint sensor up front has been shrunken down to make room for the G6 Plus's new 18:9 aspect ratio display — that's up from 5.2- to 5.9-inches year over year. The G6 Plus also features dual cameras, which didn't show up on a Moto G until the Moto G5S Plus late last year. The G6 Plus brings a gorgeous curved design to the Moto G lineup, with smarter software and a dual camera module. The differences aren't all on the surface, though. The Moto G6 Plus stays up to date with Android 8.0 Oreo, and starts off with twice the internal storage of last year's G5 Plus. In addition, it houses a larger battery — 3200mAh vs 3000mah, respectively, though that may be negated by the G6 Plus needing to power a larger display. The Moto G6 Plus is also smarter than last year's model. Motorola has outfitted the G6 Plus with new intelligent camera settings, allowing the phone to identify specific objects and even apply fun face filter effects. Moto Voice has gotten smarter as well, combining on-device commands (""turn off Bluetooth,"" ""play Narcos on Netflix,"" etc.) with Google Assistant as a fallback when necessary. See at Motorola UK Why you might not need to upgrade At the end of the day, most people that buy a Moto G aren't necessarily doing so because they're tech fanatics. They're buying it because so few other series of devices are able to offer the same levels of performance and reliability at such a reasonable price. Motorola is one of the most trusted brands in the budget space for a reason, and a year later the Moto G5 Plus is still as good a deal as ever — perhaps even more so now that it's readily available at steep discounts. The Moto G5 Plus isn't suddenly a bad phone just because there's a new model. Intelligent camera features can come in handy, but they'e far from a requirement for most people. You probably won't miss features like object recognition in the camera app, face filters, or the G6 Plus's speedy face unlock — so why pay for them? Same goes for the newer Moto Voice features, though luckily you don't have to give up Moto Gestures if you stick with the Moto G5 Plus. Both phones are pretty evenly matched in the specs department. The Moto G6 Plus has a slightly newer Snapdragon 630 versus the G5 Plus's Snapdragon 625, but both chipsets utilize the same Cortex-A53 microarchitectures (albeit at different clock speeds). If you still prefer the Moto G6 Plus for its 18:9 display, curved glass back, and dual cameras, then by all means, you should go for it. But with nearly equal specs and features in a smaller body, don't discount the Moto G5 Plus — leave that up to the retailers. See at Motorola Which is right for you? Are you interested in buying either of these budget champions? Or if you already have the Moto G5 Plus, does the G6 Plus bring enough to the table to make you consider upgrading?

Julia Alexander,"Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery takes place in 1984. It’s an important date to remember. The canonical Harry Potter universe stretches centuries, but the most important era, as it pertains to Hogwarts Mystery, is the period between Voldemort’s initial rise and Harry Potter’s attendance at Hogwarts. It’s an interesting period because we don’t really know what happened during that time; it’s your character’s chance to explore. While it may be tempting to add events in from Harry’s schooldays, it’s important that those little callbacks line up with the lore set by author J.K. Rowling. The issue is when those little fan winks and nods don’t match up with the historical dates of established events in the Harry Potter universe — for example, the introduction of the Firebolt. The Firebolt is a world-class racing broom that was produced by Randolph Spudmore in 1993. Harry was one of the first wizards to receive the Firebolt in December 1993; it was a gift from his godfather-on-the-run, Sirius Black. The broom was meant to be a replacement for his old Nimbus 2000, which was destroyed by Hogwarts’ Whomping Willow after a Quiddich game between Hufflepuff and Gryffindor. The Firebolt was then spotted again during the 1994 Quiddich Wold Cup finals. Yet somehow the Firebolt makes an appearance in Hogwarts Mystery. The Firebolt shows up in a question asked during your character’s flying class in 1984. The game expects players to have an institutional knowledge of the Firebolt because it’s a big part of the original Harry Potter canon, but the broom should not have existed in 1984. Another tiny mistake that players have discovered is the utterance of Professor Umbridge’s name. Professor Dolores Umbridge, of course, is one of the nastiest witches to ever be employed at Hogwarts. She began in Harry’s fifth year, following the death of Cedric Diggory during the Triwizard Cup and Voldemort’s return in The Goblet of Fire. A devoted follower of Cornelius Fudge, the then Minister of Magic, Umbridge came into Hogwarts to quell Harry’s cries exclaiming Voldemort was back. Umbridge only became a professor in 1996, working her entire life prior to that appointment in the Ministry of Magic. She joined the Ministry right after graduating, accepting a position as a “lowly intern in the Improper Use of Magic Office,” according to Pottermore. In Hogwarts Mystery, however, a question asks students who the Divination professor is and one of the possible answers is Umbridge. Even if the question was a play on Divination looking to the future, it’s still the wrong position. Umbridge was Hogwarts’ Defense Against the Dark Arts professor for one year, not Divination. In fact, Umbridge was the reason that Professor Trewlaney, the woman who would be in charge of Divination at Hogwarts in Hogwarts Mystery, was fired in 1996. These are just a couple examples — and are admittedly a little know-it-all-ish — but Harry Potter is one of the most popular franchises ever and is built heavily on historical lore laid out by Rowling. The callbacks to popular Harry Potter moments can be endearing, but considering how far the game goes to stay period-accurate (the Death Eaters are in prison or on the run, Voldemort is in hiding, etc.), these questions come off as poorly researched. Still, these complaints are nothing compared to fans expressing their concerns over microtransactions and exasperating wait times in Hogwarts Mystery. An entire subreddit around Hogwarts Mystery now exists to meme and poke fun at players’ inability to do anything without waiting for an extended amount of time or paying out of their own pocket. Players complained they were forced to wait eight hours while entrapped in Devil’s Snare to continue playing, or cough up funds for more energy, just an hour into the game.",Microtransactions and long queue times frustrate players along with stumbles in J.K.

Thomas Claburn,"Status.im, the makers of the Status mobile Ethereum client app, has allied with the team developing the Nim programming language, promising funding to support at least two full-time developers. The arrangement follows the launch last week of a research project called Nimbus to develop a Nim-based sharding client for Ethereum, said to be the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, relies on a distributed database – these days called a blockchain – where each node stores all transactions. While advantageous for security, this particular architecture limits scalability. Sharding breaks the database into pieces so that only a subset of the nodes will be involved in transaction verification, thereby allowing the blockchain to handle more transactions at any given time. Status.im favors Nim, the company says, because it combines the speed of C, the readability of Python, and the extensibility of Lisp. Nim code compiles into C, C++, and JavaScript. ""Status has a unique blend of hardware and licensing restrictions, together with a desire for rapid development and good performance,"" said Jacek Sieka, head of research development at Status.im, in an email to The Register. ""Nim provides a lightweight and efficient language for said devices."" Sieka explained that a goal for Nimbus is to ensure GPLv3 and LGPLv2 compatibility, to maximize the reach of Ethereum and enable adoption by governments and enterprises. ""With existing popular implementations being licensed under the GPL, we faced having to make clean room implementations of many of the core Ethereum libraries, given licensing compatibility restrictions on the hardware platforms we intend to use (including Apple),"" he said. ""This opened up the possibility of using a new language, with Nim being a top contender due to its native C backend giving us good technical reach in terms of platform support."" Nim, while still a niche language, has some enthusiastic supporters, particularly in the gaming industry where the ability to compile to C/C++ (not to mention JavaScript) is valued. The game Reel Valley was written in Nim, and there are Nim bindings for related libraries, tools, and engines such as Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) v2, Godot, Unreal Engine, Urho3D, Atomic, and GLFW. The language was introduced a decade ago by Andreas Rumpf, who bears the title Nim BDFL – Benevolent Dictator For Life – an open-source honorific Python creator Guido van Rossum also held until he abdicated last month. Until now, Nim has been supported through community-driven development and donations. With resources from Status.im, the project will get full-time attention, in the hope that it can advance more rapidly toward the planned 1.0 release. ""Unfortunately the donations are not currently enough for any of us to commit to working on Nim full-time,"" the Nim team said in a blog post on Tuesday. ""With Status' help this is no longer the case. We will now be able to stay focused on the development of the Nim programming language."" The hired guns will hunt bugs and improve Nim's compiler, standard library, and tooling. There's no release date for version 1.0 yet. About two-thirds of the outstanding issues listed still need to be resolved before that happens. Those interested in advancing Nim can always lend a hand via GitHub. ®","Development funded to boost Ethereum client code Status.im, the makers of the Status mobile Ethereum client app, has allied with the team developing the Nim programming language, promising funding to support at least two full-time developers.… <!--#include vi…",2018-08-07T19:09:17Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theregister.co.uk'}","Imagine Python fan fiction written in C, read with a Lisp: Code lingo Nim gets cash injection",https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/08/07/nim_funding_ethereum_cryptocurrency/,https://regmedia.co.uk/2018/08/07/screenshot_nim_code.jpg?x=1200&y=794,,Theregister.co.uk,nimbus,1

Jay Circo,"Last week Valve made the exciting announcement that Steam Link and Steam Video are coming to iOS. The first question most people are asking is about controls and which MFi controller would be best for Steam Link. (The amount of people who have hit us up collectivity to ask this has been a little stunning, in fact.) The answer is simple, the SteelSeries Nimbus. I’ve gone through a plethora of bluetooth controllers for my iPhone, from the underwhelming to the straight disappointing. But by far the best MFi controller I’ve gotten my paws on is the Nimbus. I’m not sure why it took me so long to get one, but after being disappointed by many options on the market now, I decided to get a Nimbus and I’ve been highly satisfied. The Nimbus is very well-made. It feels very close to modern console controllers in your hands with its perfect size, solid build and comfortable shape. It doesn’t rattle like so many other controllers I’ve used and I’ve had no problems pairing it. It’s not the most portable option on the market as it’s roughly the same size as a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, but that’s a small sacrifice for such a well-made and functional product. There are more portable options out there but most of them are so portable I can’t imagine your hands would be happy using them with PC games for extended periods of time. We've got a full review of the controller from 2015 when it was first released, and all these years later it's still on top. The SteelSeries Nimbus boasts 40+ hours of playtime on a charge and charges through Lightening Connector so that’s one less cable you have to carry. The Nimbus usually runs $49.99 USD but currently is on sale for $41.99 on Amazon with free shipping. If you’re at all interested in a MFi controller, in anticipation for Steam Link or otherwise, it comes with a very high recommendation.",Last week Valve made the exciting announcement that Steam Link and Steam Video are coming to iOS.

Alan Burdick,"A cloud is a shade in motion. Shape-shifting and moody, it arrives with a message that is opaque as often as it is threatening. “Clouds always tell a true story,” the Scottish meteorologist Ralph Abercromby wrote, in 1887, “but one which is difficult to read.” The appeal of clouds is obvious: no two are the same, and no one is the same for long. And they not only manifest change but inflict it as well. A cloud can be beautiful, terrible, or both—the embodiment of the sublime. Few other things on earth still present us with a power larger than ourselves. To watch a supercell gather force over the plains, as storm chasers take such pleasure in doing, is to watch Zeus take shape on earth. We’ve learned enough over the centuries to know that clouds aren’t supernatural; rather, fiercely condensed and sweeping, they represent all that is natural, and we stand beneath them awed and merely human. But our relationship to clouds is changing, growing hazy. In 1803, Luke Howard, a British pharmacist, proposed a classification scheme that has mostly stayed with us. It introduced four basic kinds of clouds: cirrus, stratus, cumulus, and nimbus (the Latin words for curl, layer, mass, and rain) as well as an array of subcategories that recognized the fact that one kind of cloud could turn into another. Recently, meteorologists have added several new cloud types to that known pantheon, and some of them describe clouds that are created by us: Cumulus homogenitus names the cloud formation produced by smokestacks and steam plants; Cirrus homomutatus are the high-elevation condensation trails produced by airplanes. We are changing the face of the sky. And we are altering its mood; scientists hesitate to link specific storms to global warming, but it’s clear that, on the whole, climate change is making extreme-weather events more powerful and, perhaps, more common. When we look up, increasingly the face we see is ours. In the photographer Camille Seaman’s cloudscapes, it’s difficult to not also see humankind’s self-portrait: potent, defiant, unforgiving. Clouds always tell a true story, Ralph Abercromby said, and more than ever the story they tell is the story of ourselves. Where that story will take us is difficult to read. Nebraska, June, 2012.

Peter,"The worlds largest SSD comes in a surprisingly casual package  Nimbus Datas ExaDrive DC100, a 100TB solid state drive, is packed up in a familiar 3.5 SATA drive form factor. The focus of this drive is efficiency, not speed. It is power efficient (0.1W/TB) and space efficient too. Nimbus says that data centers can reduce their spending for electricity, cooling and rack space by 85%, compared to other large SSDs (like Samsungs 30.72TB SSD ). Nimbus estimates that the total cost (drive and all) over a 5-year period will be 42% less per terabyte compared to such drives. The drive isnt terribly fast  it has symmetrical sequential read/write performance of 500MB/s and random read/write of 100K IOPS. Thats better random write than the Samsung, but slower read (it does 400K/50K). The sequential read and write speeds are quite a bit behind though (Samsungs drive promises 2,100MB/s and 1,700MB/s respectively). The ExaDrive DC100 comes with a 5-year unlimited endurance guarantee and has a mean time between failures of 2.5 million hours. If its too pricey for your needs, Nimbus Data launched a 50TB version last year.

Steve Watts,"Fortnite's latest update adds the extra gear and bug fixes we've come to expect from Epic's regular updates, but one surprising addition comes after a long wait. The 7.30 update, which released just today across all platforms, finally adds bluetooth controller support on mobile devices.
Upon downloading the update, Android players will be able to use most Bluetooth gamepads and adapters including Steelseries Stratus XL, Gamevice, and Moto Gamepad. Players on iOS can use the MFi controllers like the Steelseries Nimbus and Gamevice. It also adds 60 Hz gameplay on some Android models, for those who want performance out of their mobile play.
Other additions in v7.30 include the chiller grenade and the return of the Solid Gold limited-time mode. The chiller grenade has a knock-back effect that makes enemies slide along the ground with icy shoes but be careful because it also affects your own teammates. The Solid Gold LTM makes every weapon drop Legendary quality, letting you more easily try out some new ones, and also provides more crafting materials.
Meanwhile, Epic also announced that it will be bringing back the NFL outfits just in time for Super Bowl weekend. In addition to the regular spate of outfits, two new variants are available to celebrate the competing teams, the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams. It's also adding a free Pigskin Toy to the shop, and an NFL Rumble limited-time mode. 
Mobile Controller support Android: most of Bluetooth controller adapters, such as Steelseries Stratus XL, Gamevice, XBox1, Razer Raiju, and Moto Gamepad.
iOS: MFi controllers, such as Steelseries Nimbus and Gamevice.
Disabled phone vibration if a gamepad attached.

Some drew Ford with a phalanx of women behind her. Some created dual portraits of Ford and Anita Hill: two professional women, serious in their poise. And at least one drew Fords face in a more intimate close-up, pulling her glasses down her nose while making a pointa characteristic gesture that reminded me of professors Ive known. Anita Hill wrote in her 1997 memoir, Speaking Truth to Power, that during the Thomas hearings, she looked often at a handwritten letter she had received from a woman who identified herself as a black female attorney with similar professional experience. I want you to know that you are brave, the anonymous woman wrote. Hill wrote that she took solace in finding a comrade who understood her experience.

Im sad, too, for the divine feminine. She gives us caring, compassion, creativity, and depth...she gives us our heart. And when we deny women their truths, when we deny the feminine, we lose our heart. Make no mistake: when our heart goes missing, our collective body crumbles.

Gabe Gurwin,"Fortnite‘s latest content update has arrived, and it aims to level the playing field between those playing on game consoles and those who prefer to play on their phones. If you’re in need of some more winter-themed weaponry, the game’s update 7.30 has you covered, as well.
If you play Fortnite on iOS devices, you can now use MFi controllers, with Epic Games specifically mentioning the Steelseries Nimbus and the Gamevice. Android players can use Bluetooth controller adapters for everything from the Steelseries Stratus XL to the Razer Raiju. Regardless of your device, phone vibration will be disabled when a gamepad is connected, which should make it easier to control.
Updated 7.30 also adds the new “Chiller Grenade” weapon, which resembles the head of a very depressing snowman. The grenade doesn’t do any damage, but it cause enemies to slide across the ground after being hit. Anyone hit by it, including allies and vehicles, will also slip around for seven seconds, and the item can be found in floor loot and vending machines.
A new limited-time mode called “Solid Gold” has been added in the update, with all players receiving Legendary weapons only. You’ll also receive more materials when gathering, so matches should turn into destructive kill-fests almost immediately.
Several weapons were removed from the game in the update, as well. The Bolt-action Sniper Rifle, Burst Rifle, Heavy Shotgun, and the common, uncommon, and rare versions of the SMG have all been taken out. The Suppressed SMG, meanwhile, has been added to the game after previously being removed.
As we approach the Super Bowl, to be played between the Rams and the Patriots, Fortnite is getting in on the fun, as well. Two white road outfits — one for each team — are coming to the game on February 1, and the item shot will have a free Pigskin Toy the following day. The NFL Rumble limited-time mode will also be added, with two teams of 20 players battling it out for bragging rights.
Fortnite is now available for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. It supports cross-play multiplayer with all platforms, being only one of two games to offer play between PlayStation and other consoles.","Fortnite's latest content update has added controller support for the mobile versions of the game.

"info@hypebeast.com (HYPEBEAST), HYPEBEAST","The upcoming Dragon Ball Z x adidas collaboration recently took the sneaker world by storm, but not everyone was pleased. Sneakerhead Matthew Walsh disliked the collection enough that he was inspired to rework the entire line, shifting to Nike silhouettes for his concepts. Starting with the already-confirmed characters from the adidas drop — Frieza, Goku, Shenron, Majin Buu, Vegeta, Son Gohan and Cell — Walsh added fan favorites like Master Roshi, Bulma, Trunks and even Cooler into the mix, reworking some of Nike’s key silhouettes with colorways evoking the character’s classic outfits. The Air Max 1 features Goku’s recognizable colors and Nimbus cloud branding on the heel, while Frieza’s cool-hued greys and blues make for a perfectly layered Air Max 95 colorway. The brand new Nike Epic React is realized with a pink upper as a nod to Bulma, and the Air Vapormax sees a Shenron-green upper accented with red, atop a gold outsole. Check out the full range above, and head over to walshdesign on Instagram for his thoughts on each.

Lily Katz,"Logitech Few things are more frustrating than unboxing a fresh pair of earbuds only to realize that their virtual assistant access feature is dubious at best. Fortunately, the Jaybird Tarah is “ Made for Google,” which means that it’s received the stamp of approval directly from Google. This all but guarantees compatibility with Google devices according to this morning’s Logitech press release. But there’s more to the Jaybird Tarah than meets the ear. Like the Jaybird X4, the included earbuds are IPX7-certified. This allows listeners to submerge the Tarah earbuds in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes. Like the Jaybird X4 and its predecessors, listeners can control EQ adjustments via the Jaybird app. See also: The best workout earbuds of 2018 Additionally, the workout earbuds offer six hours of constant playback and sport an understated design, affording a versatile fit and appearance that’s gym and office appropriate. While it’s inevitable that listeners will forget to charge the earbuds every now and then, the quick charge feature grants an hour of playtime after just 10 minutes of charging. The Jaybird Tarah Wireless is available in nimbus gray-jade, black metallic-flash, and solstice blue-glacier and can be pre-ordered now for $99.99.

Griddled Fish Cakes Haddock is often used for these fish cakes, though any firm white fish will do. This recipe, adapted from Nova Scotia Cookery, Then and Now (Nimbus, 2018), creates tender cakes with golden edges. The mixture can be shaped into patties a day ahead and refrigerated, but dont roll the patties in bread crumbs until just before frying. Ingredients 1 small Yukon Gold potato (5 oz.), peeled 2 lb. firm white fish fillets (haddock, cod, or hake) 1 ⁄ 4 cup finely chopped parsley 1 ⁄ 4 cup finely chopped scallion Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. In a small pot, add the potato and enough cold water to cover; bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the potato is tender when pierced with a knife, 1315 minutes. Drain, and let cool. When the potato is cool enough to touch, coarsely mash with a fork and set aside. Meanwhile, cook the fish: Set the fillets on the baking sheet, transfer to the oven, and roast until the fish flakes easily, about 15 minutes. Pour the bread crumbs onto a plate and set aside. Remove the fish from the oven and cool slightly. In a large bowl, break the fish into chunks. Add the mashed potato, parsley, scallion, sour cream, and cayenne; mix well, then season to taste with fresh lemon juice, kosher salt, and black pepper. Form the mixture into eight patties, then roll each in bread crumbs. Line a platter with paper towels and set by the stove. In a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, add the oil. Once hot, add the fish cakes in batches and let cook, turning once, until golden brown and heated through, 34 minutes per side. Transfer the cakes to the platter and serve hot, with green tomato chow-chow, if desired.","Recipes This recipe, adapted from Nova Scotia Cookery, Then and Now (Nimbus, 2018), creates tender cakes with golden edges.",2018-10-09T16:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Saveur.com'}",Griddled Fish Cakes,https://www.saveur.com/griddled-fish-cakes-recipe,https://www.saveur.com/sites/saveur.com/files/styles/opengraph_1_91x1/public/images/2018/09/giddled-fish-cakes-1200x900.jpg?itok=HRDYzx7u,,Saveur.com,nimbus,1
Daniel Bader,"It's hard to find anyone who dislikes Jaybird's headphones. It seems to be one of those brands impervious to negative reviews. People either love them or like them; the worst I've heard about the company's headphones is that it's sometimes difficult to get a comfortable fit with any of the myriad tips and wings that come included in the box. Jaybird's latest salvo aimed at the increasingly-competitive wireless headphone space is Tarah, its replacement for the popular Freedom 2 and, at a hair under $100, its cheapest offering. Named after the group of Indigenous Tarahumara people of Chihuaha, Mexico, famous for their long-distance running, I have no doubt Tarah will be an incredibly popular product later this year. While they lack the amenities that come with the more-expensive X4, Tarah excels at the fundamentals. A long-distance win Sport headphones that hit all the right notes Jaybird has taken almost everything that makes the X series great, including great sound and IPX7 water resistance, and brought it to a more palatable price point. The Good Great sound Comfortable to wear for long periods 6-hour battery is good enough for even the longest runs Jaybird app is actually useful Google Assistant support The Bad Price may be too high for the average runner Separate charging dock easily misplaced Fewer fit options because tips and wings are combined Cinch is finicky and easy to lose Jaybird Tarah What's great Sport headphones need to provide a few important things: comfort, especially in motion; sweat resistance or, ideally, water resistance; and adequate battery life. Sound quality doesn't usually top the list, as even the most discerning listener isn't critiquing sound stage or dynamic hurtling down a sidewalk. Nevertheless, Jaybird tends to use sound quality as a way to justify its higher cost over Amazon-led competitors like Anker, Mpow and others. At $100, it's clear Tarah doesn't employ the same drivers as their $130 X4 counterparts, but with a bit of equalization through the excellent Jaybird app (available on Android and iOS), it's hard to tell them apart. By default, Tarah is bass-forward but not overpowering, and unlike other sport headphones, the mids and highs are not buried under the low-end. The more important inclusions here are comfortable eartips, which are combined tips and wings — there are three sizes to choose from, with my ears feeling best in the largest of the options — that nestle into the canal and never let up, even in motion. I'm no distance runner, but in the few miles I logged while wearing the Tarah headphones they only occasionally needed to be repositioned for a better seal (I have a feeling my ears are actually in between the medium and large sizes provided by Jaybird). There's a three-button remote below the right tip, flat and long, containing volume up-down keys as well as a combination play/pause (single press) and smart assistant (double press) toggle that, thanks to ""Made for Google"" certification, works with any phone running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or above. The remote's design is a key feature of the Tarah, as it also contains the charging pins that snap into the included dock. As with all Jaybird headphones, the dock is one of those love-it-or-hate-it inclusions, since it facilitates water resistance by negating a USB port, but it's also something that can be easily lost. Given my predilection for misplacing such chargers, I'm not a huge fan, but I appreciate its necessity, especially given the headphones' IPX7 rating. Such a combination means that, like its more expensive X4 counterpart, Tarah can withstand immersion in one meter of water for up to 30 minutes. So don't swim with them but feel free to endure a downpour or two (and if you do, you're a braver person than me). Jaybird says that Tarah is aimed at athletes that have yet to replace their wired headphones for something a bit more freeing, and the experience is certainly that. With six hours of claimed runtime — I got around five hours but I tend to listen at higher volumes than most — they're not quite as long-lasting as the X4s, but they do the job. Jaybird Tarah What's not great It's certainly not a cinch to use the included cinch with Tarah. Unlike the more upmarket X4s, the cinch here is merely a piece of notched plastic into which the flattened cord is meant to be inserted. But in my experience, the cinch was too finicky to be useful, and never entirely gave me the security I require when using one to tighten headphones against my neck. I ended up just doing without it altogether, getting used to the lightweight rubberized cord thwapping against me as I ran. No big deal. The $100 Jaybird Tarah next to the $130 Jaybird X4. Less egregious but no less disappointing is the lack of separate tips and wings that you find in the X series. I prefer sport headphones without wings at all — that's how I wear the X4s — but, as I said above, I got used to them. Given that the X series also comes with super-comfortable Comply Ultra foam tips that expand in the ears, I feel a bit spoiled (and biased), but anyone without such experience should be happy enough with the options here. Should you buy them? Yes! It's difficult to qualify Jaybird's Tarah headphones as ""entry-level"" given the plenitude of considerably less expensive options on Amazon, from brands well-known to obscure. But in the company's well-earned quadrant of the high-performance sport category, there are no better options than these. At first I was a bit confused by Tarah's pricing given their relatively short jump to the X4's $30 premium, but Jaybird assured me that the $100 barrier is considerable for many runners, especially those starting out, and it's essential for the Logitech-owned brand to offer a good pair of headphones at the price. The upside is this: I've tried many of the cheap Bluetooth sport headphones from companies like Anker, Mpow, SoundPEATS and others and they all sacrifice sound quality and convenience for cost. Given that the Tarahs are IPX7 water resistant, if you intend to wear the same pair for a long time, you'll be very happy with these. See at Jaybird The Jaybird Tarah Sport Bluetooth Headphones are available starting September 25 from jaybirdsport.com and will be sold in stores and other online retailers from early October. They're available in Black/Flash (above) and Nimbus Gray/Jade.

Billy Steele,"While the X4 does offer two more hours of listening on a charge, the new Tarah will keep the music going for up to six hours. And if you discover your earbuds are dead as you're headed out to the gym, a 10-minute charge will give you an hour of battery life. Jaybird has included fast charge features before, but it's nice to see the handy tool wasn't left off a more affordable model. The company's Speed Cinch cord management system and interchangeable tips are here as well, only this time those tips are ""ultra-soft"" silicone rather than foam. The Jaybird app is still in play here too, allowing you to tweak EQ levels and create custom settings that can be saved to the earbuds. Last but not least, there's easy access to Siri or Google Assistant, depending on your preference. The Tarah is available for pre-order now at Jaybird's website before it ships in the US and Canada next month. When it does, you can expect to see it on shelves at retailers as well. The wireless earbuds will come in three colors: Black/Flash, Nimbus Gray/Jade and Solstice Blue/Glacier. If you're smitten with that third hue though, you'll need to purchase from Jaybird or Best Buy as it's exclusive to those two spots. Of course, if true wireless is what you're after, Jaybird's Run offers just that for $180.","Jaybird has been a solid option for wireless earbuds for years now, and today the company is debuting yet another model for your workouts.

Kevin Knezevic,"Bandai Namco recently revealed the classic versions of Goku and Vegeta will be the next two DLC characters coming to Dragon Ball FighterZ. Ahead of their release next month, the publisher has shared a pair of new trailers, giving fans their first look at the two upcoming fighters in action. Both base forms of Goku and Vegeta are modeled after their appearance from the Saiyan Saga in Dragon Ball Z. Goku sports his original training gi and flies in at the start of the match on his Flying Nimbus. His moveset is likewise taken primarily from this era of the series. Along with the Kamehameha, he can unleash the Spirit Bomb and use the Kaioken to amplify his power. Vegeta, meanwhile, wears his iconic Saiyan armor, complete with his tail wrapper around his waist. He can unleash his signature Galick Gun attack, as well as the Galaxy Breaker--the move he used to kill his comrade Nappa in the series. You can watch Vegeta showcase these attacks in the video below. Bandai Namco hasn't announced a release date or pricing details for Goku and Vegeta yet, but the pair are slated to arrive in August. Previous DLC characters like Vegito and Fused Zamasu could be purchased for $5 US / £4 / $7.55 AU each. The new fighters are also included in the Dragon Ball FighterZ season pass, which costs $35 US / £22 / $40.95 AU and gives players access to eight DLC characters upon their release. Dragon Ball FighterZ is available now for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also scheduled to release for Nintendo Switch on September 28. Before then, Bandai Namco will hold an open beta for the Switch version sometime in August. Players who pre-order the Switch version will also receive a digital Japanese copy of the rare Dragon Ball Z Super Famicom game, Super Butoden, as well as immediate access to Super Saiyan Blue Goku and Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta.","Bandai Namco recently revealed the classic versions of Goku and Vegeta will be the next two DLC characters coming to Dragon Ball FighterZ.

Lee Mathews,"Just last month, Samsung unveiled a new SSD with a jaw-dropping capacity of 30TB. Now there’s already a drive that makes Samsung’s look puny by comparison. The enterprise storage experts at Nimbus Data have thrown back the curtains and revealed a monstrous 100TB drive and it’s now the world’s largest SSD. To cram that much memory into one drive Nimbus bumped up the form factor — sort of like what Quantum did with its Bigfoot drives back in the late 90s. The 100TB ExaDrive comes in a 3.5-inch package. That doesn’t just make it easier to boost capacity in the drive itself. It also makes it easier to install the drives in existing storage hardware that’s designed for hard drives — since you don’t have to screw the ExaDrive into a mounting adapter first. Let’s take a quick look at just how nuts the 100TB ExaDrive is. If you needed to throw together a rackmountable device to store a shipload of data, you might start off with one of Backblaze’s storage pods. Their signature red, sixth-gen pod has enough bays inside for 60 drives. 100TB times 60 drives? An unbelievable 6PB in just 4U of rack space. If you’ve got an entire rack to fill up — let’s say one that’s 42U tall — you could stuff 60 petabytes in that one rack. That’s more than enough room to store detailed data on, say, 50 million Facebook users. Nimbus Data didn’t reveal how much the new 100TB ExaDrive (or its “scrawny” 50TB sibling) will sell for. Not in dollars and cents, anyway. “Pricing will be similar to existing enterprise SSDs on a per terabyte basis,” according to their announcement. Over the drive’s lifespan, however, Nimbus says the ExaDrives could yield significant savings. They claim the drives are 85% cheaper to operate than similar drives, so even if they’re slightly pricier up front the savings will trickle in over time. Let us know what you like about Geek by taking our survey.","Just last month, Samsung unveiled a new SSD with a jaw-dropping capacity of 30TB.

Airport officials told a local news agency that strong winds blew off the door of a Nimbus Airline An-12 cargo plane in the very, very cold city of Yakutsk, in east Siberia. The plane made an emergency landing in a village about 12 kilometers from Yakutsk, reported the Moscow Times. Some gold fell out as far as 26 kilometers away from the airport, according to the Siberian Times. At least 172 bars of gold had been recovered, one government official reportedly told the state-run TASS news outlet. In total, the estimated luggage was worth $378 million. The Siberian Times said the cargo was reported to be owned by Chukota Mining and Geological company, and 75 percent of the company is owner by Canadian Kinross Gold. I wish I had a plane of gold.","A plane in Russia carrying $378 million worth of gold, platinum and diamonds lost its cargo on Thursday after its door broke off upon takeoff, according to The Moscow Times.

Harry Guinness,"While your iPad can be a productivity powerhouse, it’s also a hell of an entertainment center, especially if you’re on the go. Help it serve double duty if you have the right accessories. Apple has really been pushing the iPad as a work and educational tool the last few years but its initial success was as an entertainment device. The early iPads weren’t great for doing any work harder than replying to emails, but they were perfect for watching Netflix or playing super addictive games like Tiny Wings. Now, iPads are actually good for getting real work done but, to be honest, they’re even better for having some fun. While, sure, the iPad is great all by itself, if you really want to maximize your entertainment experience you need to do a little planning and accessorization. It All Starts With the Apps There are hundreds of great entertainment apps on the iPad, and as long as your iPad has enough storage space, you can install as many as you like. If you want to turn your iPad into a movie machine, Netflix and Hulu are a given, but also check out Amazon Prime Video and, if you’ve got your own movie collection, Plex. Plex requires a bit of set up, but it’s worth it. Once you’re done, you basically have your own private Netflix with all the content you could want. Unlike a Kindle, an iPad, with its full color screen, is a killer way to read comics. The good news is that comic companies have embraced this; the bad news is it’s mostly using a subscription mode. Check out comiXology for a broad selection and Marvel Unlimited if you’re really just here for the Avengers. DC is yet to release their own digital comic subscription but it’s hopefully not too far off. For bookworms, the best option is the Kindle app. iBooks is… fine, but the Kindle ecosystem is so mature that it’s impossible to beat. Gamers have essentially unlimited options. The first iPad games were fun platformers and puzzlers, but now there’s a huge number of console quality games. There is even a full PC port—yes, an actual full port—of Civilisation VI. Mount It or Put a Case On It A naked iPad isn’t actually that good as an entertainment system. They’re impossible to prop up and, if you bring them anywhere, likely to get scratched to bits. To solve these problems you need to either invest in a mount or a case. We’ve already looked at iPad mounts in depth. Our pick for the best mount for watching movies, HoverBar 3, still holds. It’s a gooseneck mount so can easily be repositioned any way you want. While mounting your iPad above your bed can be fun, it’s never going to compete with a real TV. It’s an iPad’s portability that really makes them a killer entertainment setup; you can bring your movies, comics, and games everywhere you go, whether that means moving from your couch to bed or from Cleaveland to the Bay Area. This means you’re probably better off with a case and there are two we really like. One for reading and one for watching stuff. For Reading: ProCase Leather Stand Folio ($15-22) The ProCase Leather Stand Folio is available for the iPad ($18.99), iPad Pro 10.5 ($14.99), and iPad Pro 12.9 ($21.99) (though we wouldn’t recommend reading for extended periods of time on that monster!) in a range of colors. It’s got a nice leather exterior and soft interior that not only protects your iPad, but feels great in your hands. Most importantly, you can fold over the back cover, tuck your finger in, and use it to hold your iPad in a somewhat natural reading position. It’s what I’ve been using with my Kindle for years. You can also position it at any of three different standing angles if you want to watch a movie. For Binging Shows: KHOMO DUAL Case ($15-20) KHOMO’s DUAL case is a really great, affordable, and simple case for the iPad ($14.95), iPad Pro 10.5 ($14.95), and iPad Pro 12.9 ($19.95) that will protect it front and back. It comes in a range of colors and its design mimics that of Apple’s own Smart Cover—just with added protection and a much better price. For watching movies or binging shows, you can’t do much better. The case will prop your iPad up so you can view it comfortably whether you’re sitting up, lying down, or leaning over it. There Are Kids Cases Too One final thing worth noting is, if you plan on using your iPad to entertain (or distract) your children, there are kid specific cases out there that are designed to take all the abuse a toddler can throw. Check out our guide for our full list of picks. Supercharge Your Gaming Experience There are a lot of mobile games that do well with the touch screen interface, but let’s face it: for serious gaming it’s not a lot of fun to be smashing your fingers all over the very screen you’re playing on. That’s where a good Bluetooth controller comes in very handy. Gamevice Controller Gamepad ($100) The Gamevice Controller Gamepad—available for the iPad, iPad Pro 10.5, and iPad Pro 12.9 for $99.95—basically turns your iPad into a Nintendo Switch, form factor wise, with controls mounted on either side of the screen. The position is comfortable, puts the action right between your hands, and removes the need for an additional stand to hold your iPad up while you game. You get dual analog joysticks; A, B, X, Y, L1, L2, R1, and R2 buttons; and a D-Pad. For any game that’s compatible with a gamepad—and there are hundreds upon hundreds of Bluetooth controller compatible games—it’s a total, well, game changer. There are more than a few Bluetooth controllers on the market but all-in-one comfort you get with the Gamevice really sets it apart. SteelSeries Nimbus Wireless Gaming Controller ($47) If you want something more traditional, the SteelSeries Nimbus Wireless Gaming Controller ($48) is a solid shout. It has two joysticks; a D-Pad; A, B, X, and Y pressure sensitive buttons; and L1, L2, R1, and R2 triggers. You’ll need to prop your iPad up with a case or mount to keep your hands free, but in return you get a very comfortable and ergonomic gaming experience. A nice touch is that the Nimbus charges using a Lightning cable. This means you only need to bring one charger with you. Upgrade Your Sound While the iPad’s speakers aren’t bad, per se, they don’t really pack a huge punch and, perhaps more importantly, you can’t use them in public without coming across like an ass. It’s time to upgrade your iPad’s sound output. For Privately Enjoying a Movie: BeatsX Wireless In-Ear Headphones ($150) You can’t beat the convenience of Bluetooth earbuds and the BeatsX Wireless In-Ear Headphones ($150) are the best ones going for the iPad. Trust me, they’re the ones I use because wires suck. What makes the Beats X so good is Apple’s W1 chip. This little bit of technowizardry builds on top of the Bluetooth standard and turns it into something incredibly useable. You get higher sound quality, a longer range, better battery life, instant pairing, easy swapping between devices, and they even charge using a lightning cable like your iPad. With eight hours of battery life—and around two hours with a quick 15 minute charging session—they’re hard to beat. Best for Sharing Sound: A Bluetooth Speaker With access to the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube, and serious battery life, an iPad can be the perfect device for powering your beach party’s tunes. The built-in speakers won’t cut it, so your best bet is a Bluetooth speaker. We’ve looked at Bluetooth speakers in-depth before. If you want something cheap and cheerful, check out our guide to the best budget portable Bluetooth speakers. If you need something that can shrug off a bit of rain or sand, check out our guide to the best rugged portable Bluetooth speakers. I personally use the UE Boom 2 from our rugged list. It delivers surprisingly good sound for such a small speaker and you can safely take it anywhere. Best Way to Share Sound Privately: AmazonBasics 5-Way Headphone Splitter ($7) If more than one person is trying to watch a movie on the iPad, Bluetooth headphones won’t work. This is fine if you’re somewhere private, but if you’re somewhere public you can’t just crank up the volume on the tablet or use a speaker. Instead, you need to go old school, get some wired headphones, and use a headphone splitter. The AmazonBasics 5-Way Multi Headphone Splitter is, bang for your buck, the best way to share one headphone jack with a few different people. While you’re unlikely to be able to crowd five people around a single iPad, you can definitely get three kids in the back of a car watching one. Unlike the iPhone, iPads still come with 3.5mm jacks and, since space isn’t as much of an issue, should stick around for a bit longer. I travel a lot so my iPad is my go to entertainment option. Whether I’m in the mood to read a book, watch a movie, or sing along to some songs in the shower, it has me covered. With these accessories it’s so much more than an iPhone with a big screen and with hands free viewing, enhanced sound, and a game controller, becomes a full fledged entertainment center.","While your iPad can be a productivity powerhouse, it’s also a hell of an entertainment center, especially if you’re on the go.

Rich Haridy,"Last month Samsung revealed its latest record-breaking large capacity solid state drive, cramming 30 TB into a 2.5-inch drive format unit. Now Nimbus Data has quickly smashed Samsung's benchmark launching the ExaDrive DC100 – a 3.5 inch SSD drive unit with a massive 100 TB capacity. Unlike Samsung's earlier effort, which offered impressive capacity alongside ultra-fast read and write speeds, the DC100 is engineered to prioritize capacity over everything else. The device only reaches 100,000 IOps (read or write) and up to 500 MBps throughput. These are relatively modest stats, but the drive is marketed at enterprise customers including giant data centers looking to reduce rack space and power costs. The ExaDrive DC series will be available later this year in both 50TB and 100TB models. Nimbus Data is currently only sampling the product with select strategic customers and no price has been revealed. It's suggested the cost will be similar to current enterprise SSDs on a per terabyte basis, which is code for ""it will be extraordinarily expensive,"" at least initially. Thomas Isakovich, CEO and founder of Nimbus Data, says that the power efficiency of the drive means it will draw 85 percent less power per terabyte. For a company dealing in big data, this should make the ExaDrive relatively competitive despite the initial cost. ""As flash memory prices decline, capacity, energy efficiency, and density will become the critical drivers of cost reduction and competitive advantage,"" says Isakovich. ""The ExaDrive DC100 meets these challenges for both data center and edge applications, offering unmatched capacity in an ultra-low power design."" While this SSD is only really of interest to big cloud services or giant corporations managing data centers, it is undoubtedly a new benchmark for the future of storage with elements of the technology sure to be incorporated into general consumer-orientated outcomes very soon.

Eli Hodapp,"Late last year we posted about a somewhat surprising bundle that popped up on the Apple Store which featured a SteelSeries Nimbus MFi Controller and Minecraft: Apple TV Edition. Well, if that piqued your interest but you're more into playing on mobile than you are Apple TV, you'll be happy to learn that Gamevice now has a very similar bundle featuring their expandable controller and Minecraft for $89.95. If you're new to the Gamevice, we reviewed it when it was the hip new thing all the way back in 2015. (We also reviewed an even earlier unit for the iPad mini.) Basically, it's an expandable controller that clips your iOS device in the middle, ending up with an arrangement that's sort of like the Switch. (Amusingly enough, they're also suing Nintendo.) If you're curious what other games (besides Minecraft ) you can play with MFi controllers, the Gamevice Live [ Free ] app does a great job at aggregating all of them. Chances are you already own more than a few games that could benefit from Gamevice or any other MFi controller.","Late last year we posted about a somewhat surprising bundle that popped up on the Apple Store which featured a SteelSeries Nimbus MFi Controller and Minecraft: Apple TV Edition.

Ahead of their release next month, the publisher has shared a pair of new trailers, giving fans their first look at the two upcoming fighters in action. Both base forms of Goku and Vegeta are modeled after their appearance from the Saiyan Saga in Dragon Ball Z. Goku sports his original training gi and flies in at the start of the match on his Flying Nimbus. His moveset is likewise taken primarily from this era of the series. Along with the Kamehameha, he can unleash the Spirit Bomb and use the Kaioken to amplify his power.

Benjamin Mayo,"The Apple device ecosystem has heralded new ways for creative game makers to realise their vision, often by combining physical elements with apps, to form engaging and addictive experiences. Most of this guide leans on casual gaming where a whole family can join in together, but there’s also a consideration for the serious side of games too. We feature the endearing Beasts of Balance, the Osmo game system, MFI game controllers and more. Read on after the jump for the full list. Family Fun Gaming Gift Guide Beasts of Balance is an incredible modern tabletop game that uses a complementary app as a central part of the game. It takes the universal concept of ‘build as tall a tower as possible’ and fleshes it out into a rich, endearing, modern board game. The Beasts of Balance plinth communicates with an app running on iPhone, iPad or Apple TV. Players set cute animal figurines onto the plinth to start building a tower. The plinth includes an NFC reader which scans the object as they are placed, which causes special events to happen on the app display. Interlocking cross parts cause mutations in the virtual creature which is artistically brought to life on the iOS device screen. You also have other challenges to keep on top of as the tower is built, like remembering to change the moon to a sun. If the tower falls, the app shows a bubbling volcano and the tower has to be quickly rebuilt before it erupts. There are wonderful tradeoffs built into the gameplay; awkwardly-shaped objects have higher point scores but a much higher risk of toppling the tower altogether. The build quality of the stackable animals and artefacts is stellar; everything in the physical box and digital app is beautifully illustrated and designed. You can set it up in the living room with Siri Remote and Apple TV, or play in a bedroom with a single iPhone or iPad. It really is fun for the whole family. Buy the kit for $99, the app is a free download. There are a lot of interesting games to play on the App Store, but you often feel limited by the touch interface for controlling your character or moving around the world. The Gamevice attaches to the iOS device — I use it with my 12.9 inch iPad – to add gamepad buttons and analog joysticks on both sides of the screen. Read my full review here. The Gamevice essentially turns your iPhone and iPad into a handheld console. Comfortably grip the device with the attached left and right pads, take advantage of fine-grained control and character movement with the buttons, triggers and analog sticks whilst leaving the entire display unobscured. If you loved using a Gameboy Advance as a kid, this is basically an iOS version of that. MFI game controllers have been possible for a while and now there is a big library of games that support them. Because the Gamevice is essentially a handheld dock, it will only work with a single form factor of iPhone or iPad. If you buy a newer iPad in the future, there’s a good chance the Gamevice will no longer fit. Check out the full Gamevice range here for almost every iOS device on the market; pricing varies around $100 mark. This is the second MFI controller recommendation. Whereas the Gamevice (above) snaps onto an iPhone or iPad to make a handheld, the SteelSeries is a traditional external controller design. It’s just like a console gamepad and communicates wirelessly with iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. If you play any games on Apple TV, even simple one-button titles like Mr Jump or Crossy Road, using a real game controller is so much nicer than the Siri Remote. It also lets you dive into richer titles like Rayman Adventures and Oceanhorn ; touch controls simply cannot beat physical buttons for games like these. The convenient thing about the Nimbus controller is that it doesn’t require a particular form factor; it just connects via Bluetooth to any iOS or tvOS device. Unlike the Gamevice though, you do have to remember to charge the Nimbus battery separately. The Apple Store has a special bundle by the way for this item; you can get Minecraft for Apple TV and this controller at a reduced combo price. There’s also a Stratus controller which is half the price, and about half as nice to hold. The Osmo game system is a fun accessory that you can gift to kids and play together as a family. You set an iPad up on the special stand and attach a special red mirror that angles the camera downwards. The Osmo comes with physical objects that the app detects through the camera to create an interesting combination of physical and digital world. Move a plastic block on the table and the iPad app tracks the motion and uses it in the on-screen game. Most of the games are targeted at younger children, with a few activities for older ages and adults. You can get kits for drawing, learning vocabulary, music sequencing and basic building blocks of programming, and more. The Osmo packs are pricey but you can buy a Starter Kit to begin with and gradually add in additional sets to expand the experience. Read my hands-on review of the Osmo Monster kit from last year. I like the Osmo because it integrates the iPad — which most kids regard as a mere portable TV screen frankly — with a kinaesthetic activity. You can even argue there is some educational value amongst the entertainment. They have also recently released a base for some models of iPhone, if you don’t want to use an iPad. The new Apple TV features a much more powerful A10 Fusion chip to drive the 4K video playback, but it also theoretically enables fully-fledged gaming with console-like visuals. A lot of that promise is still dream rather than reality. There are fun games to play on Apple TV but I haven’t seen anything yet that takes advantage of the additional power. If I was buying a new Apple TV for the first time, though, I’d still opt for the new 4K version. The price premium compared to the 2015 model is only $20 (and you probably don’t need the 64 GB model). That slight price bump is worth the future-proofing. Nevertheless, I still think the Apple TV is a fun casual games machine. Most titles are simply ports of games from iPhone and iPad, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t fun. The Siri Remote works decently for simple one-button and motion controlled driving games, of which the App Store has plenty. tvOS plays host to a lot of family games too; shout out to SketchParty TV for something to play as a family this holiday season. There are a handful of sophisticated titles too; I loved playing through Oceanhorn and I’m really looking forward to the visually-enhanced sequel due in 2018. Does it compare to an Xbox? Of course not — but fortunately the Apple TV does a lot more than just play games. Mac Gaming Slightly off-topic but I want to include a quick word on the state of Mac gaming. In short, it’s okay as long as the games you want to play are available on macOS and aren’t looking to max out every visual effect in the settings screen. There are a lot of caveats compared to a Windows machine but you can get pretty far with just a MacBook Pro. My addiction League of Legends (and Starcraft before that) all began on a Mac, and the arrival of Steam on the Mac platform has expanded the ecosystem of available titles considerably. You will want to snag a mouse and external keyboard, though. My personal opinion is that almost all of the PC accessories advertised for ‘gaming’ are overpriced and not worth the money. I buy relatively-cheap USB mice and use them until they wear out. I think you can justify spending more on fancy mechanical keyboards if you want to, but my personal preference is to use Apple’s own wireless keyboards for consistency with what I type on for my day-job. Grab Bag Nintendo Switch It’s hard to disagree that Nintendo had a huge impact on the gaming world this year, launching their new console generation that can dock into a TV and be picked up to use on the go, the Nintendo Switch. Despite being technically less powerful than an iPad Pro, the Nintendo Switch ecosystem features AAA titles that the iOS or tvOS App Store simply can’t compete with, including game of the year candidates Mario: Odyssey and Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Apple TV Siri Remote Loop Everyone remembers the horror stories of breakages that happened with the Nintendo Wii years ago. Unfortunately, the Apple TV shares much of the same issues with its Siri Remote. A lot of the dumb fun Apple TV games rely on accelerometer motion controls. At the same time, the Siri Remote is made of metal and glass — it is prone to both breaking and breaking other things. Apple actually has a solution for this: the $9 Remote Loop. It slots into the Lightning port and adds a little wrist-strap for when you are using the remote. It’s kind of silly to include it in a gift guide roundup but if you are buying an Apple TV for the first time and have an inkling to try out the game offerings in the tvOS App Store, pick up a remote loop while you are at it. Philips Hue lights A regular feature on my yearly holiday gift guides is some kind of smart lighting solution.

Jared Nelson,"Following countless rumors in the wake of the success of Pokemon GO(Free), it was just over a year ago that Niantic officially announcedHarry Potter: Wizards Unite, a Harry Potter-ified take on the augmented reality map-based gameplay of their smash hit mobile game. Things went awfully quiet after that until just last month when the first trailer and details emerged for Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. Well, the slow drip of hype-building is in full force as today a new teaser video was released for Harry Potter: Wizards Unite showcasing a strange occurrence captured on a local Australian traffic camera. Check it out.
So there you have it, out of control Nimbus 2000s running amok in Sydney, Australia. As we learned last month, the premise of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite is that an event called the Calamity is coming and causing all sorts of magical mischief across the world. As part of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, it’ll be up to you towait for itUNITE with your fellow wizards to deal with these magical calamities, probably in a very similar way to how you’d catch a Pokemon in Pokemon GO. A fleet of Nimbus 2000s flying down the highway certainly seems like a calamity to me. I’m guessing we’ll be getting many more tidbits like the above in the months to come as Harry Potter: Wizards Unite gears up for its launch at some point in the future, and in the meantime you can still “enlist"" aka pre-register over at the official website.","Following countless rumors in the wake of the success of Pokemon GO [appprice url=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pokémon-go/id1094591345?mt=8""], it was just over a year ago that Niantic officially announced Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, a Harry Potter-ified …",2018-12-20T18:04:42Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Toucharcade.com'}",A New ‘Harry Potter: Wizards Unite’ Teaser Appears,https://toucharcade.com/2018/12/20/harry-potter-wizards-unite-teaser/,https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hpwufeat.png,,Toucharcade.com,nimbus,1
Mitchel Broussard,"Fortnite today has been updated to version 7.30 on the iOS App Store, introducing support for MFi controllers on iPhones and iPads. This means that controllers like the SteelSeries Nimbus and Gamevice accessories can now be used to play Fortnite while connected to your iOS device (via TouchArcade).
It's been nearly one year since Fortnite's Battle Royale mode launched as a standalone app on the iOS App Store, first debuting as a beta in March 2018. The game tasks players with surviving in a 100-player battleground until they're the last person standing. On mobile, the game used an on-screen joystick to control your character before today's introduction of Bluetooth controller support.
Anyone playing Fortnite on iOS can use Cross Play to play with people on other consoles, like Xbox One, PC, and Mac. As Fortnite gained popularity, in June the game was estimated to have earned $100 million from players on the iOS App Store alone in the three months it had been available.
Today's update also introduces the Chiller Grenade, a new limited time mode called ""Solid Gold,"" and various bug fixes. Android devices are also getting Bluetooth controller support as of the 7.30 update.","Fortnite today has been updated to version 7.30 on the iOS App Store, introducing support for MFi controllers on iPhones and iPads.

Brigitt Earley,"Years ago most kitchens were dark and full of autumn tones, like red, gold, and even orange. More recently, those bolder shades have given way to all-white kitchens. Why? Homeowners are building and renovating kitchens to be open to the rest of the floorplan, rather than segmented. ""Kitchens have basically become invisible to blend with the rest of the home. That really affects the paint you're going to choose—the color has to flow effortlessly,"" says Sarah Fishburne, director of trend and design at The Home Depot. ""Before when [the kitchen] was segmented, you could paint a kitchen one color and the dining room another."" Lighter colors also help open up the space. ""The general rule of thumb is to keep it light and neutral: Think white, light blue, even pale yellow. These colors will make the room look bigger, bring light into the space, and make the kitchen look and feel clean,"" says Abra Landau, resident design expert at Fashion Furniture. ""Don't forget that your kitchen is not only a room for entertaining, but also a workspace that you want to keep looking as tidy as possible."" But all-white certainly doesn't mean drab—or even monotone. While walls are more muted, homeowners are having fun by experimenting with color on cabinets, doors, trim, and even ceilings. ""Consumers are embracing colors in different ways, and they aren't afraid of it,"" Fishburne says. ""It's more individualized and intensified than ever before."" Still, paint colors are fickle, and it's tricky to find the right shade. So we asked the pros to help us wade through thousands of hues to find the best paint colors for a kitchen. The tones are mostly soft and light—grays, blues, whites, and taupe—but there are a few wildcards in the mix for those who want to step outside the box. "" Farrow &amp; Ball Shaded White is a favorite neutral for kitchens. It can be paired with just about any color on cabinets and still feel clean and light."" — Marika Meyer, designer ""A light blue with a bit of turquoise such as Benjamin Moore Breath of Fresh Air can open up a tiny kitchen. The watery sky color looks amazing with white or light maple cabinets."" — Leslie Saul, designer ""One of our favorite go-to colors in a kitchen is Farrow &amp; Ball Borrowed Light. Depending on the direction of light, this blueish gray is neither too light nor too dark. It is the perfect backdrop against a light or dark countertop or cabinetry."" — Terri Fiori, designer ""The kitchen is an area where you need to feel relaxed yet energized enough to cook and possibly entertain while doing so. Greens, specifically spring greens with heavy yellow undertones like Benjamin Moore's Sounds of Nature and Shimmering Lime, are great examples that evoke both rejuvenation and transformation. The color can be used on the cabinets, walls, and the ceiling to help define small urban spaces, and pops of the color can be naturally introduced through plants and herb gardens, kitchen accessories, and dishware."" — Lori Weitzner, designer and author of Ode to Color ""This is an ethereal gray that provides just a hint of color. Nimbus creates a calm and inviting backdrop for your kitchen when applied to the walls and is incredibly versatile. It changes throughout the day depending on the light. Therefore, it will complement any decor style. If you are feeling bold, pair it with deep blue or, dark grey cabinetry—Hale Navy and Chelsea Grey work great—and brass finishes."" — Jacquelin C. Franklin, designer and Thumbtack pro ""Soft and subtle, with just a touch of warm tone to it. Skylight is one of those colors that works perfectly as wall paint or even the ceiling color."" — Bradley Odom, founder of Dixon Rye ""It's a nicely balanced white that doesn't skew too warm or cool for all different lighting styles. It can be coordinated perfectly with White Dove (cut down to 50 percent) for the cabinets. Creating these subtle differences will help distinguish between the elements, yet leave your space with a perfect tone-on-tone aesthetic. Of course, tone-on-tone is not for everyone, but choosing White Dove for your walls will work for any color cabinets and be the perfect contrasting backdrop. Some fun cabinet colors that won't wash out on the white background are Benjamin Moore Hale Navy or Benjamin Moore Hunter Green."" — Tracy Lynn, designer ""If you want to go outside the box, try a black wall with a white kitchen. Dark, rich colors really accentuate cabinetry, windows, and trim. It gives a beautiful blank canvas."" — Sarah Fishburne, The Home Depot director of trend and design ""My latest favorite color for kitchens is Farrow &amp; Ball's Inchyra Blue —it's sexy and comforting and represents the warmth of the hearth and hospitality. It looks great with brass fixtures, and brings a bit of color to a stark modern kitchen. I've noticed it also puts people at ease."" — Mally Skok, designer","Years ago most kitchens were dark and full of autumn tones, like red, gold, and even orange.

Jacob Siegal,"System software update 6.50 rolled out for the PlayStation 4 on Thursday morning, bringing with it one of the most requested features for the console. Once you update your console, you will be able to sync it with any compatible iOS device to stream PS4 games anywhere you have a Wi-Fi connection. All you need to start streaming right away is the free PS4 Remote Play app installed on your iPhone or iPad and a stable connection.
Once you download and open the app on your iOS device, you’ll be presented with a big “Start” button in the middle of the screen. Push it, and you’ll be taken to a login page to enter your PlayStation Network information. Once you’ve logged in, the app will begin searching for your device, turn it on, and sync up.
Like on other devices, Sony has included on-screen touch controls that you can use to navigate the menus of the PS4 as well as play games, but you’re going to need a physical controller to get the most out of the iOS app. Unfortunately, Apple’s mobile devices don’t natively support the DualShock 4, so you’re going to need to pick up a third-party MFi controller — like the SteelSeries Nimbus — to play games the way they were meant to be played.
It’s worth noting that it was possible to stream PS4 games to your iPhone and iPad before the release of the official app, but many of these apps cost money, and none were sanctioned by Sony. It may have taken more than four years for Sony to bring Remote Play to iOS after the feature was introduced on its Xperia Z3 (and later on Android, PC, and Mac), but better late than never. Now, I’m off to find an MFi controller.","System software update 6.50 rolled out for the PlayStation 4 on Thursday morning, bringing with it one of the most requested features for the console.

Mike Hanlon,"Bonhams' Stafford Motorcycle auctions are held each spring and autumn at the Staffordshire County Showgrounds in the United Kingdom, and these auctions invariably throw up some fascinating motorcycles. This year the biggest prices were again fetched by project bikes, with three of the top four lots being bikes that required a complete restoration. Having looked through the results, here are the most interesting bikes amongst the 539 lots on offer. $12,100 (£9,200) | 1953 Nimbus 750cc Model C Four Produced as a sideline by Danish vacuum cleaner manufacturer, Fisker &amp; Nielsen, the Nimbus 750 first appeared in 1919, and was produced in limited quantities until 1954, with only a few bikes produced after 1954 by assembling spare parts. There were several of these remarkable machines sold at Stafford with the above machine being one of the last produced (1953) and the equal most expensive of the group at just $12,000 a pittance considering the astonishing work performed in restoring the bike to new condition at Aarhus Nimbus in Denmark. Just 12,000 of these bikes were produced during the four decade production run, with more than 4000 still registered and active in Denmark, and many more coveted in other countries. The ability to purchase a machine of such technological excellence, rarity and near perfection for four figures is astonishing. Other Nimbus fours on offer at Stafford included 1938, 1939 and 1948 models. Auction Description $12,856 (£9,775) | 1992 Harley-Davidson 1,340cc FXDC Super Dyna Glide Custom One of the highest profile motorcycle enthusiasts of recent decades has been crooner Engelbert Humperdinck. One of Humperdinck's Harleys sold in Stafford for a very reasonable price considering the provenance. Auction Description $14,822 (£11,270) | 1981 Benelli 900 Sei Several six cylinder motorcycles of note sold in Stafford, including this 900 Benelli. Those who have never had the pleasure of riding a six would be surprised at the smoothness and power of these bikes, with the Benelli in particular offering sweet handling into the bargain. In addition to the 900 Benelli, a 1982 Honda CBX1000 sold for £4,830, a Kawasaki Z1300 with just 531.7 miles on the dial sold for £12,075 and another, bored to 1500cc and turbocharged that had been built by a Cosworth engineer for his own use, selling for £7,820. Auction Description £ 15,525 | 1980 Laverda Jota 1000 I tested one of these for a motorcycle magazine back in the day, and can attest that it gave little away to the Japanese superbikes of the time at the top end, with the thunderous mid-range of the 1000cc three cylinder making it particularly potent on the racetrack. The Jota won the British Avon Production series in 1976. 1978, 1979 and 1980. Incredible value given the rarity of the bike. Auction Description $18,150 (£13,800) | 1989 Suzuki RG500 Gamma The ultimate two-stroke road bike, with power and handling to match. For those who wish to debate the relative merits of this bike versus the Yamaha RZ500, I owned one of the Yamaha V4s when this bike came out, and can vouch that I was very disappointed that the RG500 was so much better. The auction description contains a quote from Bike magazine in 1986: "" The 99 rear-wheel horses it produced on Motad's generous, but consistent dyno is 22bhp up on Yamaha's RD500LC, a massive 45bhp more than Honda's 387cc NS400R and only a couple of horses down on the output of its own GSX-R750 stablemate."" This is the closest road bike to the fearsome two-stroke 500cc MotoGP bikes, which were the most challenging race bikes to ride that have ever been created. Auction Description $32,880 (£25,000) | Hip flask awarded to Rem Fowler Regarded as the single most important piece of Isle of Man TT memorabilia, this silver hip flask was awarded to H ""Rem"" Fowler for winning the inaugural 1907 International Tourist Trophy Twin-cylinder Class at the Isle of Man in 1907. Auction Description $25,712 (£19,550) | 1962 Norton 348cc Manx Model 40M This 1962 Norton Manx 350 has spent almost its entire life being raced, and is hence fast and reliable as the weaknesses of the original design have been addressed, with enhancements to the performance by legendary tuner Ray Petty, an enclosed coil spring conversion, a four-leading shoe front brake, a belt primary drive, a Mitsubishi magneto, and a five speed gearbox. Auction Description £ 20,700 | 1959 BSA 604cc Gold Star Restored to perfection, bored to 604 cc, and sold with more than £4,000 in receipts, which does not represent the full amount spent. Auction Description $27,981 (£21,275) | 1974 Kawasaki 748cc H2 The Kawasaki H2 two-stroke triple 750 was the production racing king for a short period prior to the release of the Kawasaki 900 Z1 four. This result is at the high end of pricing for the H2 at auction, and truly original models like this one are extremely rare. Auction Description $30,250 (£23,000) | 1925 New Imperial Model 7 Outfit This 1925 New Imperial 8hp Model 7 combination has quite some provenance, being formerly owned by the New Imperial Club's founder and chairman, and more recently by media personality Richard Hammond. Auction Description $30,250 (£23,000) | 1989 Yamaha FZR750R OW01 The massive importance of the World Superbike Championship has seen many homologation specials built by the factories so that their race bikes could have a solid competition basis. Only 500 of Yamaha's FZ750R (known as the OW01) were built to meet minimum homologation numbers, and it is hence far rarer than the Honda RC30. The OW01 was also much more expensive than the RC30, costing £12,700, more than twice the price of the standard FZR1000, with the race kit adding another £2,415 to the price. The Honda RC30 cost £8,499. Auction Description $30,250 (£23,000) | 1917 Reading-Standard 1,150cc 'Big Twin' This represents good buying for the 101-year-old flathead Reading-Standard, one of the most powerful motorcycles of its day. Built in Reading, Pennsylvania for just 20 years, the company motto will no doubt resonate: ""No limit but The Law"". Auction Description $30,250 (£23,000) | 1923 Indian 37ci Scout A well restored version of a 1923 600cc Indian Scout featuring electric lighting, Bosch magneto, a Schebler Deluxe carburetor, and the helical gear primary drive which gave the model such a wonderful reputation for reliability. Auction Description $31,762 (£24,150) | 1979 Yamaha TZ750F Few motorcycles have had as much impact as the Yamaha TZ750. Though the FIM's Formula 750 was intended to be a class for production motorcycles, Yamaha homologated enough TZ750s to run in and dominate the class for a decade, with this TZ750 being the final ""F"" version. Great buying at just $31,762. Auction Description $31,762 (£24,150) | 1980 Yamaha TZ500G The TZ500G was Yamaha's customer Grand Prix bike, and was introduced in 1980. The TZ500G is much rarer than Suzuki's RG500 customer Grand Prix bike and this machine was campaigned in 1980 by Dutchman Boet Van Dulmen. Van Dulmen won his only Grand Prix in 1979 aboard an RG500 Suzuki, with the best result for this bike being fourth at the Dutch TT at Assen in 1980 behind Jack Middelburg, Graziano Rossi (father of Valentino Rossi) and Franco Uncini. This bike was sold without the gearbox assembly and clutch assembly, which no doubt depressed the price. Auction Description $33,275 (£25,300) | 1959 AJS 350cc 7R Produced from 1948 to 1963, the AJS 7R ""Boy Racer"" was an over-the-counter racing motorcycle which became a racing mainstay of club racing across the world, holding a similar position in vintage racing to this day. Auction Description $34,787 (£26,450) | 2015 Kawasaki H2R At 310 hp, the Kawasaki H2R is the most powerful production motorcycle ever created, and cost £41,000 when it was released in 2015. Which makes this bike, with one kilometer on the odometer, a bargain at the price it sold for. Auction Description $36,300 (£27,600) | 1986 Yoshimura Suzuki GSX-R750 Racer This bike is a full Yoshimura factory racer that was used by Satoshi Tsujimoto to win the 1986 All Japan TT Formula 1 Championship. That same year, Tsujimoto paired with Kevin Schwantz to finish third in the Suzuka 8 Hour race, wand second in the Daytona 200 behind Wayne Rainey. Incredibly good value for a motorcycle of such provenance. Auction Description $39,325 (£29,900) | 1961 Norton 499cc Manx Model 30M A bike with a long competition history from the same stable as the 350 Manx mentioned elsewhere, with many of the same modifications. Good buying for someone wishing to go classic racing. Auction Description $60,500 (£46,000) | 2012 Suter MMX1 Grand Prix Racer This machine was ridden during the 2012 MotoGP season by American Colin Edwards and is one of the few machines to have consistently brief ""Claiming Rule Teams"" (CRT) era. Faced with escalating costs and dwindling participation, Dorna came up with a lower-cost category that ran alongside the factory prototypes. The idea was that CRT teams would run production-based engines in prototype chassis, and that engines would be claimable by factory teams for a set fee of 25,000, though why a factory team would want to acquire a tuned road-bike engine was never explained. In the event, none ever did. This bike runs a BMW engine, and scored eight points scoring finishes during the season, with a high of eleventh place at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Auction Description $62,012 (£47,150) | 1989 Honda VFR750R RC30 The record price for a Honda RC30 homologation special was set earlier this year at $92,000 in Las Vegas by a bike that was essentially unused, having just 14 km on the odomoter, with most of those clocked up being pushed from trailer to stand inside exhibitions. This bike had even fewer ""push kilometers"" on the clock, which shows just 2 km from new, all of them under human power. It hence represents extraordinary value at that price. Auction Description $63,525 (£48,300) | 1919 Henderson 1,147cc Model 2 Z Four $74,415 (£56,580) | 1930 Henderson KJ Streamline Four This bike is one of the redesigned Henderson fours which came out in April, 1929 with styling that earned it the ""streamline"" name. Sadly, just six months after it was released, the Great Depression began when Wall Street had a meltdown on October 29, 1929. Many wonderful cars and motorcycles ceased production over the following few years, and the 1300cc four cylinder Henderson was one of them. This bike more than doubled its estimate. Auction Description $81,675 (£62,100) | 1951 Vincent 998cc Series-C Black Shadow $81,675 (£62,100) | 1992 Honda NR750 Honda's RC30 and RC45 homologation specials are now consistently getting high prices, with the record for an oval-piston, eight-valves-per-cylinder NR750 (aka RC45) being $92,952 (sold for £57,500) at another Bonhams Stafford auction in October, 2013 and another NR750 achieved 63,250 ($86,031) in Paris in February, 2014. Only 200 of these bikes were made, which makes this an excellent buy considering the low volume and spectacular performance and build quality. Auction Description $83,187 (£63,250) | 1937 Böhmerland 603cc Langtouren The Czech-built Böhmerland was powered by a 600cc single cylinder engine and was produced in several different versions with varying wheelbases. This bike, the Langtouren, was designed as a three-seater, and has the longest wheelbase of any motorcycle ever produced. The bike was also the first to have cast alloy wheels, and with only 30 believed to have survived from the original 3000 unit production, the price was always going to be high. Auction Description $90,421 (£68,750) | 1952 AJS 498cc Model 20 Springtwin Cutaway Model Had this AJS 500 twin been in perfect working order, it would not have attracted a price greater than 10 percent of this cutaway model, but as we've written previously, cutaway models are now very much in vogue, as so few were made. A spectacular exhibit piece and an equally spectacular price. Auction Description $96,800 (£73,600) | 1972 MV Agusta 750S The world record price at auction for one of MV Agusta's most famous roadgoing motorcycle is held by Bonhams, and was set in the Spring Stafford Sale in April, 2014, at US$143,661 (sold for £85,500). Just 401 MV Agusta 750S motorcycles were made, and this bike had a complete engine rebuild 3,283 kilometers prior to the auction, so while a $100,000 motorcycle cannot be considered cheap, it was still a good buy. Auction Description $105,875 (£80,500) | 1952 Norton-JAP Mk1 'Saltdean Special' This is a very significant motorcycle, having been built in Saltdean in 1952 and campaigned until 1994, winning countless races along the way. The bike uses a JAP engine in a Norton ""featherbed"" frame, though the engine uses the heads and barrels from a JAP speedway engine, and runs on methanol fed by twin Amal GP carburetors. Auction Description $166,375 (£126,500) | 1928/1925 Brough Superior SS100 Yet another basket case Brough Superior, though very little is known of the history other than that it has been in single family ownership for the last 70 years. Despite being in bits, the bike appears complete, though it went to auction with a crack in the timing case of the JAP engine. Auction Description $211,750 (£161,000) | 1933 Brough Superior 981cc SS100 This 1933 Brough Superior 981cc SS100 Project sold for £161,000 after being stored since the 1970s. The bike's history makes a great story as it was purchased in 1963 for £33 as the first motorcycle for Jean Knight, a woman living in South London and working in North London, who used the bike for her daily commute for many years. Full story in the Auction Description. $219,312 (£166,750) | 1927 Brough Superior SS100 Pendine Built from a genuine Pendine racing engine that was originally supplied to Brough Superior by J A Prestwich in April 1927, this 1927 Brough Superior SS100 Pendine did particularly well at auction considering the remainder of the bike has been built from parts, including a replacement frame. Auction Description $347,874 (£264,500) | 1925 Brough Superior SS100 Sand Racer Expensive basket cases have become a hallmark of Bonhams' Stafford sale in recent years, with two of the most valuable basket case motorcycles in history selling in 2015 when a pair of Brough Superior 981cc SS100 Alpine Grand Sport ""projects"" sold for £236,700 (US$365,000) and £259,100 (US$400,000), respectively. This year several more very expensive basket cases sold, with the ex-C.F Edwards 1925 Brough Superior 981cc SS100 Sand Racer achieving more than double its estimate and selling to a UK buyer in the auction room for £264,500, the highest amount ever achieved for a dismantled Brough Superior in British pounds. The only known image of the bike with Edwards aboard is above. It was built specifically for sand racing and featured dropped handlebars, narrow un-valanced mudguards and a Binks ""mousetrap"" carburetor. The vagaries of international exchange rates might put the price of this bike at a record for a basket case motorcycle when measured in British pounds, but a distant third if those prices are converted to the American dollar, which is the defacto standard measure of auction value.

Prasad,"Epic Games has updated Fornite for mobile with support for Bluetooth controllers in their latest version 7.30 patch.
Both iOS and Android users can now use Bluetooth controllers from popular brands. On Android, you can use practically anything, including the SteelSeries Stratus XL, Gamevice, Xbox One X controller, Razer Raiju, and the Moto GamePad. On iOS, you will need a MFi or Made for iPhone certified controller, such as SteelSeries Nimbus and Gamevice.
Epic has also added support for 60fps mode on Android. However, currently it is only available on three devices, Samsung Galaxy Note9, Honor View 20 and Huawei Mate 20 X. Epic has partnered with Samsung and Huawei in the past so this timed exclusivity is not a surprise. However, the feature will be rolled out to other devices in the future.

Kenan Machado,"Global equity markets were lower in Asia on Tuesday, as a pullback in commodity shares dragged Australia’s benchmark index lower, while tighter liquidity weighed on Chinese stocks. Commodity stocks have been key to the recent rebound for Australia’s underperforming equities market, helping the S&amp;P/ASX 200 XJO, -0.84% hit 10-year highs earlier this month, but profit-taking pressure has been building. The stock index was down by as much as 1.1%, with the energy sector retreating around 2.5%, even though oil prices barely budged overnight. The sector had jumped nearly 15% in barely a month. The stock benchmark was last trading down 0.9%. Utilities stocks in Australia were also weaker, down 1.6% after recently hitting their best levels since midyear, while heavyweight miners BHP Billiton BHP, -1.38% and Rio Tinto RIO, -0.96% were also lower after recently hitting multiyear highs. “The Australian market has had an uncommon run now. In these circumstances it is reasonable to expect some profit-taking,” said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Tuesday’s pullback came after another member of Australia’s parliament resigned over dual-citizenship status. The crisis tipped the conservative government toward the minority in the lower house of parliament last week, after two lawmakers were disqualified and forced to re-contest their seats. Meanwhile, Chinese shares were also under pressure, with the Shanghai stock benchmark SHCOMP, -0.45% down 0.3%, after logging a six-session winning streak and closing at a fresh 22-month high on Monday. Data late Monday showed that growth in M2, the broadest measure of money supply in China, was lower-than-expected at 8.8% in October, the weakest increase on record. In Shenzhen 399106, -0.62%, the stock benchmark was off 0.4%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.02% was roughly flat. “Stocks there have a direct correlation with liquidity,” said Alexander Lee, chief investment officer at Nimbus Capital Group. He expects declines in stocks to be temporary, though, as the squeeze on liquidity could help reduce overcapacity, ultimately helping boost earnings. Data released Tuesday also showed slower industrial output and fixed-asset investment growth in China in October. “At the end of the day, China still intends to strike a balance between growth, debt and leveraging,” said Commerzbank economist Zhou Hao. In South Korea, the Kospi SEU, -0.25% was down 0.3%, led by declines in tourism-related shares such as Korean Air Lines 003490, -1.14% and Asiana Airlines 020560, -2.04%. The stocks are sensitive to rising tensions with North Korea. On Monday, a North Korean soldier defected to the South by crossing the Demilitarized Zone. He was injured after being shot by fellow North Korean soldiers. Bucking the region’s declines, Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average NIK, +0.57% was up 0.3% in the morning session, lifted by gains in the U.S. dollar against the yen, which supported export-related stocks. The dollar JPYUSD, -0.002640% was last at ¥113.62, up from ¥113.47 before the local stock market closed Monday. The rebound came after the benchmark index fell 1.3% to end lower for the fourth consecutive session on Monday, its largest four-day point decline since Nov. 9 last year.","A pullback in commodity shares dragged Australia’s key stock index lower on Tuesday, while other regional markets looked for direction in early trade.",2017-11-14T03:55:48Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Marketwatch.com'}",Asia Markets: Australian stocks dive as Asia-Pacific markets mixed,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/australian-stocks-dive-as-asia-pacific-markets-mixed-2017-11-13,http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FY250_dive11_ZG_20171113225320.jpg,,Marketwatch.com,nimbus,1
"Leif Johnson, Leif Johnson","You can now play PlayStation 4 games on your iPhone with Sonys official PS4 Remote Play app! Youve been able to stream games for years with the unofficial R-Play app, but were happy to see official support from Sony itself. And for free!
Just dont get the impression that this is a replacement for your actual PS4. Yes, it lets you control games straight through your iPhone, but its essentially a streaming service that merely beams the games that are playing on your PS4 to your iPhone. The iPhone doesnt host the games themselves as you might expect from a Nintendo Switch, so if you dont have a stellar Wi-Fi signal, youre gonna have a bad time.
Leif JohnsonYoull also have a bad time if you cant get used to playing like this without a controller.
But still! PS4 games on an iPhone! The possibilities are, well, limited! Because of the inevitable latency involved and issues with button mapping, Remote Play is best used for turn-based games or walking simulators rather than games demanding fast responses like Apex Legends. Even so, its a cool option to have and it costs nothing to set up if you want to try it out.
[ Further reading: Everything you need to know about iOS 12 ]
What do you need?
A PlayStation 4 running running Sonys 6.50 firmware or higher. Youll get the best quality with a PlayStation Pro
An iPhone running at least iOS 12.1
The PS4 Remote Play app installed from the App Store
(Optional) An MFi controller such as the Rotor Riot, the SteelSeries Nimbus, or the Gamevice
How to set up Remote Play between your PS4 and iPhone
On your iPhone, install the PS4 Remote Play app from the App Store.
Turn on your PS4 and log into the desired account. If you need to update your PS4 to the latest firmware, you can do so by scrolling to Settings on your PS4 and then selecting System Software Update.
Make sure your iPhone and PS4 are on the same Wi-Fi network.
Open the PS4 Remote Play app. Head to the Settings gear in the upper right and log in to your PlayStation Network account. Once youve done that, go back to the main screen and hit the big blue Start button. The app will look for your console.
If it fails to connect (and it likely will if youre youre on an older PS4), youll see a prompt in the app asking for a code that will allow you connect the devices manually. On the PS4, go to Settings &gt; Remote Play Connection Settings &gt; Add Devices, where youll then see the code. Youll have 300 seconds to enter the eight-digit code on your phone before it disappears.
Tap the white space of the app to make the keypad go away, then click Register in the lower right.
Youre in! Youll immediately see an overlay resembling the buttons of a DualShock 4 controller. A brief tutorial shows how to use the digital thumbstick buttons. You can use Remote Play in either landscape mode or portrait mode. Your fingers dont obscure the screen in portrait mode, but the streamed screen itself is much smaller.
If you want Remote Play to connect to the PS4 even when its in rest mode, go to Settings &gt; Power Save Settings &gt; Set Features Available in Rest Mode and then hit Enable Turning on PS4 from Network. 
To quit using Remote Play, simply leave the app. Since youll lose a connection every time you leave the app, youll need to hit Start to reconnect every time. Fortunately, itll be easier on future attempts.
Leif JohnsonYou can also enter the code manually at any time while Remote Play is searching for a PS4.
Optional (but not really): Connect an MFi controller
You cant use a Sony DualShock 4 controller with your iPhone, but MFi (made for iPhone) controllers like the Rotor Riot, the SteelSeries Nimbus, or the Gamevice make for decent alternatives. Its usually very easy to hook one up, as I demonstrate here. Once youve paired an MFi controller, the digital DualShock 4 button overlay in the Remote Play app should automatically disappear.
Leif JohnsonPS4 Remote Play with a Gamevice attached. Compare this with the image at the top. Much better, eh?
Keep in mind that the button schemes for MFi controllers dont always perfectly align with those on the DualShock 4. On the Gamevice, for example, you cant press down on either of the two thumbsticks (usually known as the L3 and R3 buttons). That means you wont be able to use either the sprint or the enemy lock-on in God of War, which makes gameplay unnecessarily difficult. The Rotor Riot is reportedly the only controller that supports L3 and R3, but I havent had a chance to try it out.
Youll also have latency issues when using an MFi controller, much as you will with using Remote Play in general. This means that Remote Play isnt ideal for games requiring rapid reaction times. You wouldnt want it for playing Apex Legends, in other words, but its fine for turn-based games or lightly interactive games like Persona 5.
Things to keep in mind
If your Wi-Fi isnt strong enough to support the stream, you can adjust the video quality in the Remote Play apps settings (accessible only from the screen where you click Start when you open it). You can choose between four settings, although the best two720p and 1080pare only available if youre using the PlayStation 4 Pro.
You will lose connection to the game youre playing every time you leave the PS4 Remote Play on your app.
PS4 Remote Play will drop its connection if you interact with the physical DualShock 4 on your PS4.
PS4 Remote Play will drop its connection if you turn off your PS4.
The PS4 and the iPhone running PS4 Remote Play need to be on the same Wi-Fi network. Playing over LTE doesnt work.
You cant use a Sony DualShock 4 with the PlayStation 4. Itd make all this easier if you could, but I dont make the rules.

Brittany A. Roston,"Nimbus Data just set a storage milestone with the announcement of its new ExaDrive DC100, a 100TB solid-state-drive. This model boasts the largest capacity of any SSD to date, offering more than three times the storage capacity of its closest competitor, the company says. In addition to its record-breaking capacity, Nimbus says its ExaDrive DC100 uses 85-percent less energy per terabyte than competing models. The company explains that it focused on both efficiency and capacity with its ExaDrive DC100 model. The model uses Nimbus’s multi-processor architecture and 3D NAND, the result being a drive that is “small enough to fit in your back pocket” while having a capacity massive enough to hold up to 2,000 iPhones worth of data. The company specifically mentions data centers as a suitable fit for its new drive. Assuming a data center were to use the drive, Nimbus brags that a singe rack can offer more than 100 petabytes of capacity while keeping the per-terabyte costs, power, and cooling requirements down by 85-percent. This SSD model offers up to 500Mbps throughput with up to 100,000 input/output operations per second (IOps). Ultimately, the DC100 uses only 0.1 watts per TB; it has a 3.5-inch form factor and a SATA interface. The company guarantees five years of “unlimited endurance” for this particular model; it has integrated capacitors to help protect data in the event that electricity is suddenly lost. The drive will be “generally available” starting this summer, according to the company, though it doesn’t state any prices at this time. Nimbus will also offer a lesser 50TB capacity model.

AppleInsider,"Now that the iPad mini has had a respectable spec upgrade, we decided to para-drop into one of our favorite games to see how well it performs as a dedicated gaming device.Apple significantly beefed up the iPad mini, including a fully laminated and a brighter display at the max PPI that the iPhone maker supports —326 —all powered by the A12 Bionic processor. The chip isn't new, but it is new to the iPad mini and it really pushes those pixels.
We started out playing Fornite at 30 fps with our SteelSeries Nimbus XL controller. Using the controller is great with an iPad mini as the display. It is easy to prop up the ever-so-light tablet almost anywhere. The game felt fluid and fast with no ridiculous load times.
Soon after, we wanted to try playing freehand, sans controller. The iPad mini still has large bezels on the top and bottom which is still good for a gaming device that you have to grip. This makes it easy to hold while keeping your hands largely off the display —other than to use the controls. One downside we ran into, is that when holding the tablet our hand covered the lower of the two speakers iPad mini has, muffling the sound a bit. 
Something we noticed quickly with the new iPad mini is the fully laminated display. The 2018 iPad still uses a non-laminated display which puts a layer of air between the glass and the screen itself. By laminating those two together, it brings the content closer to your fingertips. This gives you the feeling of more closely interacting with the game, especially with the speediness of the A12.
We did try moving the frame rate up to 60 fps to see how it handled it, and the iPad mini played through without issue. The game felt immediately smoother and this was how we kept it for our future battles. It was a much better experience than we've seen before, on a more portable form-factor than the iPad Pro.
The 2019 mini also supports the P3 wide color gamut so the colors within ""Fortnite"" really popped. It was brighter too, which made a big difference when playing outside —now that the weather is finally warming up.
When we look at our other options, the iPad mini really shines as an excellent portable gaming solution. The screen is a perfect size for portability but maintains a high resolution. Our Nintendo Switch has about 2/3 the resolution of the iPad and doesn't look nearly as good. You can't use an iPod Touch to play ""Fortnite"" as it requires at least 2GB of RAM. You could use an iPhone but even with the XS Max the screen isn't as large and your hands block part of the content.
""Fortnite"" was a delight to play on the iPad mini and with its power, size, and display. We have no doubts about our new device of choice for handheld gaming.","Now that the iPad mini has had a respectable spec upgrade, we decided to para-drop into one of our favorite games to see how well it performs as a dedicated gaming device.",2019-03-28T16:08:26Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Appleinsider.com'}",'Fortnite' on new iPad mini 5 cements it as a solid gaming device,https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/28/fortnite-on-new-ipad-mini-5-cements-it-as-a-solid-gaming-device,https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/30362-49745-Fortnite-xl.jpg,,Appleinsider.com,nimbus,1
Stephanie Mlot,"A Russian runway was paved with gold last week when a plane carrying precious metals lost part of its cargo. Gold, platinum, and diamonds rained down as the Nimbus Airlines jet gained height over Yakutsk Airport. En route from the Kupol mine to Krasnoyarsk, the plane stopped in Yakutsk to refuel. Upon taking off again, the Antonov AN-12’s cargo door flew open, scattering a $368 million haul as far as 16 miles from the airfield. Transporting nearly 10 tons of goods, the plane immediately returned to the airport; nobody was hurt. The cause of the incident is under investigation. “It should be noted that the aircraft [was] prepared for the flight by the technicians who are part of the crew of this vessel,” the Yakutsk Airport said in an official statement. Based on a maintenance card, the aircraft was “serviceable and prepared for the flight.” The door, which fell into a nearby field, was damaged due to the “shifting of cargo,” Russia’s Investigative Committee told AFP. Police sealed off the area during a search for the missing pieces. Some 172 bars, weighing about 3.7 tons, were collected by Friday, according to state-run news agency TASS. “Not a single one was lost,” Stanislav Borodyuk, head of the Moscow office of Canada’s Kinross Gold company, said. “The cargo is in Yakutsk under protection.” Still, rumors of a few forgotten pieces are fanning residents’ hopes of getting rich quick. TASS reported a young couple examining the field with a metal detector. “It looks like all [the] gold was picked yesterday,” they said, taking only a quick break before continuing the search. A short video from the scene highlights what look like large grey bricks lying on the runway. The gold-silver alloy bars belong to the Chukot Mining and Geological Company—an affiliate of the Kinross Group; they were heading to Krasnoyarsk for refining. 1.

Chance Miller,"Earlier today, a spelunking developer discovered code within Fortnite that seemingly hinted the hit-game was soon making its way to Apple TV. Subsequently, Epic Games shot down those hopes, saying the code mention of tvOS is the result of “general Unreal Engine support.” While Fortnite might not be coming to tvOS anytime soon, today’s excitement only underscores the potential of gaming on tvOS… When Apple unveiled the tvOS-powered Apple TV in 2015, it touted gaming support as one of the key upgrades over previous Apple TV models. Since then, however, gaming has struggled to gain traction on tvOS and there have been no signs of improvement. At the onset, Apple itself could be blamed for the lack of developer enthusiasm surrounding tvOS games. At the time, the company required that all games for the Apple TV be compatible with the included Siri Remote – a requirement that forced developers to overly simplify their game offerings for Apple TV. One year later at WWDC 2016, Apple reversed its stance and said that Apple TV developers no longer had to support the Siri Remote, instead allowing them to “require the use of an MFi game controller.” This meant developers could build more advanced games by not having to cater to the simpler Siri Remote. Despite Apple’s change in heart, gaming on the Apple TV still isn’t where one would expect it to be three years after the introduction of the tvOS App Store. Further, the lack of interest in tvOS gaming comes amid a revitalization of the gaming market – especially on the casual end of things. With the launch of the Apple TV and tvOS, Apple had the opportunity to fill the void left by Nintendo in the gaming industry. Nintendo, the arguable king of casual gaming, had left a gaping hole in the market as it struggled to compete with the popularity of iOS gaming, seemingly paving the way for Apple TV to take over. Instead, here we are in 2018 with iOS gaming still popular, tvOS gaming still nearly nonexistent, and Nintendo back at the forefront of casual gaming thanks to the Nintendo Switch. What comes next? Last month, my colleague Bradley Chambers questioned whether Apple does enough to justify the Apple TV’s price point. Like others, he pointed out that the $179 price point would be far easier to stomach if the Apple TV offered more expansive gaming support. So what can Apple do to breathe new life into tvOS gaming? First off, Apple needs to work with developers to revitalize interest in tvOS gaming. We’ve seen Apple work directly with iOS developers in the past, and there’s no reason it shouldn’t do the same with tvOS. If Apple is able to secure a handful of big name titles for tvOS – such as Fortnite or PUGB – it could further increase interest in Apple TV gaming by bundling an MFi controller with the device. Currently, you can get an Apple TV 4K paired with a SteelSeries Nimbus controller for $199 through Best Buy. Whether Apple offers the same bundle, or works with a different accessory maker, including a controller with the Apple TV would go a long way in attracting developers and gamers alike. The best MFi controllers for Apple TV: Wrap up In many ways, today’s excitement (and subsequent disappointment) surrounding Fortnite coming to Apple TV only further sheds light on how Apple has dropped the ball with Apple TV gaming. It’s hard not to blame Apple for the lack of developer interest, either. The initial requirement of Siri Remote support for all games likely pushed developers towards other platforms. And despite the reversal in policy, Apple hasn’t exactly done anything to convince developers it is serious about Apple TV gaming. It’s easy to feel like Apple is neglecting the Apple TV. The past couple of tvOS updates have brought few new features to the device – and Dolby Atmos has been over a year in the making at this point. Pair that with the considerably lower price of competing set-top boxes, and the Apple TV 4K is growing increasingly hard to recommend to average consumers. While improved gaming support won’t solve all of the device’s problems, it would be a major step in the right direction. What do you think of the Apple TV’s future? Is improved gaming support something Apple should focus on? Let us know down in the comments!

"Srinath Rao, Sagar Rajput, Sushant Kulkarni","Akshays mother at Bhadale village on Thursday. (Express photo)
At the Vasai home of Rishikesh Sakpal (27), his father Raju (55), mother Rajashree (53) and wife Ruchita (26), are scanning news channels for some information about him. Rishikesh is one of the Indian sailors missing since the Kerch Strait mishap in which two ships Candy and Maestro caught fire in Russian waters on Monday.
Rishikeshs employer, Nimbus Maritime Services Private Limited, has been sending hourly updates to the family on the status of the search launched by local authorities. The 10 pm news bulletin confirmed what they knew already – the search was called off for the day due to poor light.
The only son of Raju, a tuition teacher, and Rajashree, a homemaker, Rishikesh joined Nimbus four years ago after clearing Merchant Navy entrance exams. He currently works as a bosun on the Candy and left home three months ago on a ninth-month trip. The 27-year-old married months before his current assignment. The family last spoke to him on Sunday, when he was two days away from making port.
A science graduate, Rishikesh had studied at D S High School in Sion and Bhonsala Military School in Nashik. He always wanted become a sailor, his father said. We havent been able to sleep in three days, Raju added.
The two ships carrying crew members from India, Turkey and Libya caught fire Monday while fuel was being transferred from one vessel to another. The mishap killed at least 12 seamen.
Indian authorities have said six sailors have been killed, four have been rescued and six are still missing. The Ministry of External Affairs has identified the deceased as Pinal Kumar Bharatbhai Tandel, Vikram Singh, Sarvanan Nagarjan, Vishal Dod, Raja Debnarayan Panigrahi and Karankumar Haribhai Tandel. The missing Indian seamen have been identified as Siddharth Meher, Neeraj Singh, Sebastian Britto Breezlin Sahayaraj, Rushikesh, Akshay Baban Jadhav and Anandasekar Avinash.
Twenty-three-year-old Akshay, who hails from Kolhapur in Maharashtra, was to return home next week as his yearlong contract with Nimbus was to end on Friday.
We all spoke to him on video call Monday morning. He was on watch duty. He asked me what I had made for breakfast and was happy when I showed him the pohe I had prepared, said his mother Sharada.
While his mother and brother Rahul wait at Akshays village Bhadale near Warananagar for news of him, his father Baban Jadhav is in Mumbai to get information from the Nimbus office.
An employee at Warana Milk Federation, Baban said: He was to come home next week after a year. I just want to see his face.
Akshay completed a certificate course in maritime services from Chennai after passing Class XII in science stream.
Akshays friend Gaurav Patil said, Recently, on a video call, he showed his ship and explained his work. On Sunday, some of us friends spoke on a conference call. We all hope he comes back safe.
The father of another missing sailor, Siddharth Meher (24), on Thursday wrote to the External Affairs Ministry, seeking help. I have sent a mail to Ministry of External Affairs besides the Moscow Embassy. I have also spoken to authorities of Nimbus Maritime, Siddharths father Satyanaryana said.
The sailor, who hails from Odisha, is the only son of Satyanaryana Meher, regional manager of Paradip Phosphate Limited and Geetanjali Meher.
The Indian shipping authorities said on Thursday that they were working on the documentation of the deceased, as the Russian agencies wanted to conduct postmortem examination of the bodies. The authorities added that the Russian Maritime Agency and Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centre Novorossiysh were finding it difficult to locate the missing, as due to the explosion, Candy carrying liquified natural gas (LNG) has got half submerged in the sea from one side.
The authorities are trying to ascertain whether the missing persons are in the submerged part of the vessel, said an official.
Indian authorities said that sending rescue ships from India wasnt feasible as it would have taken more than 20 days to reach the accident spot.","The two ships carrying crew members from India, Turkey and Libya caught fire Monday while fuel was being transferred from one vessel to another.

Meg Lappe,"The first half marathon I ever ran was supposed to be a full marathon. With ten weeks until the LA Marathon, I realized I was out of my league after just one long run, and dropped down to a half. Any way you looked at it, I had a lot of miles to log. Generally, with any condensed training plan (or starting a new routine), my joints (hips and knees) end up taking a toll, but the shoes I ran in kept the pain at bay. If you need any support during runs, I highly recommend Asics — the structure and cushioning of the shoes helps every muscle in your body regardless how many (or how few!) miles you’re putting on them.

Chris Danforth,"To celebrate the launch of Kiko Kostadinov’s first footwear collaboration with ASICS, we caught up with the Bulgarian designer in Dover Street Market’s Ginza outpost so he could walk us through his new take on the GEL-BURZ 1 sneaker. Kostadinov’s Instagram followers will have an idea of the assorted references he pulls from daily life, more specifically his fascination with uniforms of construction workers and unassuming pedestrians. “For both shoes, we haven’t actually used any references apart from ASICS’ own developments. The only references are the colors which relate directly to my seasonal collection, where the shoes live,” explains Kostadinov, whose new ASICS designs were informed by elements of the GEL-NIMBUS 20 and GEL-VENTURE 6. Kostadinov further explains the stealthy sneakers in his own words; “A silent combination of the best performance shoe ingredients. With ASICS’ history and dedication to constant improvement and contribution to sport performance, it’s really easy to become inspired and push something new. I came from a different angle and looked at their best products. I was pleasantly surprised to see the performance team is so fearless, even requesting from me to push my ideas further.” Core-performance attributes allow Kostadinov’s collaborative sneakers to maintain an alignment with ASICS’ sporting background, while catwalk-ready color blocking add more appeal for the Dover Street Market crowd, who came out to meet and greet Kostadinov in Tokyo. The product launch was complete with an installation featuring live models. Providing some insight into the future of the collaboration, Kostadinov noted to Highsnobiety “We are taking baby steps at the moment, due to tight deadlines, but I’m extremely happy with the shoes that we created in the past year. I hope it’s only the beginning of something that can grown into something more substantial.” To stay updated, follow @Highsnobietysneakers on Instagram.

Hadlee Simons,"Motorola Lenovo ‘s Moto G series has firmly established itself as one of the more popular budget device ranges in India. Now, the company has announced the availability of the Moto G6 and G6 Play in the market. If you’re hoping to get the standard Moto G6 then you’ll need to log on to Amazon India and spend 13,999 rupees (~$209). The G6 Play, on the other hand, is a Flipkart exclusive and has a 11,999 rupee (~$179) price tag. Both models will start retailing in the region at midnight tonight (IST). If you don’t care for online retailers then you can also get the devices from Moto Hub offline stores. So what warrants spending an extra 2,000 rupees for the vanilla Moto G6? Well, you’re getting a dual camera setup (12MP and 5MP), a higher resolution selfie camera (16MP), a sharper screen (full HD+), a more powerful but still mid-range Snapdragon 450 chipset, and more RAM/storage (3GB/32GB). Meanwhile, the Moto G6 Play packs a single 13MP f/2.0 main camera, an 8MP front-facing camera, 1,440 x 720 display, a less capable Snapdragon 427 processor, and 2GB RAM/16GB of storage. Nevertheless, the G6 Play has one sizeable advantage over the regular G6 in the form of a 4,000mAh battery. So if you value endurance above all else, this might be up your alley.

Wesley Yin-Poole,"Bandai Namco has released a gameplay video showing off Base Goku, one of two DLC characters coming to Dragon Ball FighterZ in August. Base Goku has his Super Spirit Bomb and arrives on his Kinto'un, aka the Flying Nimbus, the magical, yellow cloud he uses to get around. Base Goku can also go Kaioken, which lets him access new combos and power up when his allies are downed. The second DLC character coming to Dragon Ball FighterZ in August is Base Vegeta, who uses his Gallick Gun and Galaxy Breaker meteor attack. Base Vegeta joins FighterZ in August alongside Base Goku. I have mixed feelings about the addition of base versions of two characters already in the Dragon Ball FighterZ roster. On one hand, high level players will enjoy the nuance offered by an alternative take on Goku and Vegeta. On the other, more casual players might have hoped for more unique characters as paid DLC to help add variety to an already samey roster. Four of the eight DLC characters that form the FighterZ Pass are already out. Base Goku and Base Vegeta brings the current total to six, which means two are left to reveal.","Bandai Namco has released a gameplay video showing off Base Goku, one of two DLC characters coming to Dragon Ball FighterZ in August.

The car also gets high-gloss black exterior trim elements and unique 19-inch 5-arm-design gunmetal wheels with summer tires. The exhaust system is a trumpet-style stainless steel system unique to the model. Brake lights use OLEDs rather than conventional LEDs, OLEDs are currently exclusive to the TT RS.

Power will be for the standard 2.0L turbo four with 228 horsepower and standard 7-speed S Tronic dual-clutch transmission. Audi says the car can hit 60mph from a standstill in 5.2-seconds in coupe form and 5.5-seconds in roadster form. The anniversary models come with lots of tech inside.

"info@hypebeast.com (HYPEBEAST), HYPEBEAST","The past year has seen London-based designer Kiko Kostadinov reveal a slew of collaborations. Alongside extending his work with Mackintosh and debuting a collection with Camper, the Central Saint Martins graduate released a hugely popular capsule with ASICS — which is set to continue for a second season. The athletic sneakers are a mash-up of archival ASICS silhouettes, with the collaboration build around the Japanese brand’s functional footwear. Recently, Kostadinov sat down with HYPEBEAST Japan at the collaboration’s launch at Dover Street Market’s Ginza outpost to discuss the sneaker collection, his workwear influence and what he thinks of the “Dad shoe” trend. You can read the full interview below. Could you briefly outline how did this collaboration came about? They approached me about two years ago. After I graduated we had a very casual meeting with their team in Amsterdam and they were keen to work with someone in fashion. They hadn’t really done that before with the performance side, which was the one I was very interested in. It was just finding a way to work together because there was no pre-existing structure with regards to how to do it. It was a really organic process – developing the shoe, looking at parts of the shoe, what can we combine and making sure that it could live with the runway collection, which it did with the previous season and with the current season that we just showed in January. How did you decide which attributes to fuse together into one shoe? I think when you have 200 shoes on a wall it’s more like sensibility and taste. You just like what you wanna wear and you think you can push something. It was really about that. A different company will give you an existing shoe and be like, “We wanna promote this shoe. Work on this shoe.” With ASICS it’s do whatever you want. The only thing we can’t really develop is a new sole because that’s a performance shoe and it takes three years to develop it. It’s all done in Kobe in the science center. The only company in the world that can make their own soles from scratch, instead of outsourcing it. For them it’s a big commitment to develop a sole because it needs to work and you need to give it to someone to run in. So obviously the only thing we couldn’t change is the sole. But I can look back five seasons ago and pick a sole from training, to volleyball, anything I want so it was a very organic process. What are the key features that make a good shoe? I can’t really tell you that because I don’t run because I have a small knee injury – I’m trying to fix that so I can actually contribute more. It’s a bit sad that I’m working with ASICS but I can’t actually run. Anyway for me because I stand all day and walk around the city or around the office, and I’ve been wearing ASICS since I was at school, it was really about picking which shoe is the best to do that. Nimbus was one of the best ones and the GEL technology is what makes it more special. That’s why the sole is Nimbus. Then on the upper you have Venture which is more of a trail shoe, and then you have a transparent layer which is very new for them. They had never done that. It brings it back to the runway collection which is more sinister. It also works as extra protection and stability. That’s how it kind of came about. There is a lot of crossover between performance and fashion now. What do you make of this trend and where do you see this going in the future? I don’t really believe in trends. I think it has happened around the world constantly for the past 30 years. Since the ‘80s I’m sure people have been wearing sneakers with suits so I don’t think it’s a trend or a new thing. I don’t really look at those things, it’s not really important for me. How about the dad shoe? Maybe certain people who used to wear boots now all wear chunky shoes with actual jeans. It’s a trend where people want to look like someone else. I think it’s existed before and people wore comfortable shoes mixed with fashion items before. Not everybody wears those shoes, it’s just what you’ve been shown. Chic people don’t wear dad shoes right? I don’t even know what dad shoe means. It’s like the New Balance, like Steve Jobs no? I think that’s more of an American thing. It’s strange. My dad doesn’t wear those kind of shoes. Have your past sporting experiences informed your design processes today? Or have sport and fashion always stayed as two separate things? I haven’t really practiced sports for a while so I don’t buy sports equipment or do something with it on the weekend. I don’t think it informs any of that yet. I haven’t based a collection on football yet but maybe one day we’ll see. I don’t think it’s relevant at the moment. HYPEBEAST HYPEBEAST HYPEBEAST HYPEBEAST HYPEBEAST HYPEBEAST HYPEBEAST Where did you learn about utilitarian design? It just kind of semi-developed through my studies. The workwear element, I just hated the fact how people keep going back to French ‘60s workwear and military uniforms from 50 years ago. I was interested in looking at what people wear now. If you go to Germany, if you go to Japan, if you look at workwear, it’s so modern, it’s very impressive. It’s the same for military. So when you look what those people wear now it’s not a M-65 jacket or MA-1 jacket, they don’t wear that. That was 50 years ago. It was more about looking at today and how can you inform a collection or contribute rather than looking to the past. Could you talk about your extensive archival collection of military and workwear? It’s a constant research. We don’t really research for one week and then have a new collection. Even during a collection if I find something online or in-person here or somewhere else I visit it’s almost like putting it in a safe box and bringing it out later. It will become useful at some point but it might only be two years later. It’s a really nice experience when you remember a piece and bring it in and it contributes to something I do now. Just the problem now is the space. Just storing all these things. Do you have any particular items that stand out? I don’t think I have one thing in particular. I don’t compare what’s better or what’s worse because in a certain situation one thing can be better than the other.

peterdeadline,"UK broadcaster BBC has upgraded Scandinavian crime drama The Bridge – moving the series from digital station BBC4 to mainstream channel BBC2. The final series of the Swedish/Danish co-production, which is produced by Endemol Shine Group ’s Filmlance International and Nimbus Film, will air in 2018 after the UK broadcaster closed a deal with distributor ZDF Enterprises. It will see the return of Saga and Henrik, played by Sofia Helin and Thure Lindhart, as they attempt to solve one last case, while also dealing with their professional and personal relationship. The Bridge, known locally as Bron, is BBC4’s highest ever rating drama with over 1M viewers drawn to the drama in November 2015. The series was created by Hans Rosenfeldt, who more recently created ITV and Netflix’s Anna Friel-fronted crime drama Marcella. It was previously adapted in the US by FX. Rosenfeldt and co-writer Camilla Ahlgren said: “We’ve been on an amazing journey with Saga Norén and Henrik Sabroe and felt that there was one last thrilling story to tell. Set two years on from last series, Saga is coming to terms with the dire consequences of being accused of her mother’s murder when a macabre crime seemingly linked to migration takes place. Meanwhile, Henrik continues his desperate search for his children.” Patrick Holland, Channel Controller of BBC2 added: “It is great to see this fantastic series back and on BBC2. The Bridge has helped redefine television drama in recent years and it is fitting that its final series will be showcased on BBC2.”","UK broadcaster BBC has upgraded Scandinavian crime drama The Bridge – moving the series from digital station BBC4 to mainstream channel BBC2.

Tyler Lee,"Remember last month when Samsung announced that they had started to mass produce the world’s largest SSD with 30TB worth of storage ? If you’re looking for more than 30TB, Nimbus Data might have the solution for you as the company has recently unveiled the new world’s largest SSD which comes with a whopping 100TB worth of storage. This SSD by Nimbus Data comes in the form of he ExaDrive DC100 which is built around 3D NAND flash. This allowed the company to squeeze all that data into a standard 3.5-inch form factor, meaning that you could in theory use it as a plug-and-play replacement for your computer or server if you need extra storage. In addition to boasting that it is the world’s largest SSD, Nimbus also boasts that the device is the world’s most energy efficient SSD where it draws as little as 0.1 Watts per TB. Apparently this makes it about 80-90% lower than the competition which means that it can store more data but use less energy, making it ideal for server farms that need to be run 24/7. According to Eric Burgener, research vice president of Storage at IDC, “The release of such a high capacity flash device that is fully compatible with HDD form factors opens up the opportunity to turbo charge big data platforms while at the same time improving reliability, significantly reducing device count, increasing data mobility, and lowering the TCO of multi-PB scale storage platforms. Devices of this class will allow flash to cost-effectively penetrate a broader set of use cases outside of tier 0 and tier 1 applications.” Pricing and availability was not mentioned, but the company did state that it will be comparable to existing MLC SSDs.

Taylor Kerns,"TRAIN EVERY DAY WITH THE NEW JAYBIRD TARAH WIRELESS SPORT HEADPHONES Streamlined Design Ideal for Athletes Ready to Cut the Cord Tuesday, September 25, 2018 12:01 am PDT Cut the cord with the new @Jaybirdsport Tarah, essential performance designed for daily training. #PowerYourPassion https://jaybird.co/tarah PARK CITY, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jaybird, a leader in sport headphones for runners, announced today Jaybird Tarah Wireless Sport Headphones, the earbud choice for those looking to cut the cord. These waterproof and sweatproof Bluetooth headphones deliver a secure, comfortable fit with uncompromised sound and six hours of play time. Tarah opens the door to the freedom of wireless sound while offering a lightweight, low profile design ideal for daily training and fitness performance. ""We know a lot of dedicated athletes and fitness fans haven't yet made the switch to wireless headphones,"" said Jamie Parker, CEO of Jaybird. ""We designed Jaybird Tarah to be the perfect introduction to going wireless - tangle-free and easy-to-use while delivering on the Jaybird fundamentals: sweat- and waterproof, a secure and comfortable sport fit, incredible sound with customizable EQ settings through the Jaybird app, and great battery life. Once people try Tarah, it will become an essential part of their training gear.” Tarah allows you to enjoy your music without distractions from your headphones. The interchangeable, ultra-soft silicone ear gels mean you can customize for the perfect secure and comfortable fit. The Speed Cinch cord management system allows you to adjust the length of the cable on the fly for the perfect fit. The internal rechargeable battery offers six hours of play time per charge, so you’ll always have plenty of power for a full session. In addition, a quick 10 minute charge gives you one hour of play time, so you'll have no excuse not to hit the trail or the gym. The IPX7 waterproof rating (waterproof down to one meter for up to 30 minutes) and double hydrophobic, sweat-proof nano coating mean you’re prepared to take on any weather conditions as you train. It's also the perfect companion for your video workout programs, whether on a stationary bike or a treadmill. Manage calls, and control and listen to your music with the push of a button without interrupting your run or training. Tarah is also compatible with Siri and Google Assistant and is ""Made for Google,"" ensuring compatibility with Google devices. With the Jaybird app, you can customize Jaybird’s premium sound so you can hear your music, your way - pump up the bass, crank the treble or find that perfect balance. The app even allows you to connect with the Jaybird community making it easy to listen to and discover Spotify® playlists to power you through your training session. Pricing and Availability Jaybird Tarah Wireless Sport Headphones are expected to be available for order exclusively at jaybirdsport.com on September 25, 2018 and in stores and online in the U.S. and Canada in October 2018 for a suggested retail price of $99.99.

Taylor Kerns,"Design, features, what's in the box At first blush, you could be forgiven for mistaking the Tarah for the X4: same fin design to hold the buds in place, same remote placement, same Jaybird-branded cinch. But when you look closer, the differences become apparent. The cable is thinner, the remote has a sort of rubbery coating, and those trademark fins aren't quite the same. They serve the same purpose, but they're attached to the silicone tips on the earpieces (Jaybird calls these combo pieces eargels, which I don't appreciate), so you can't swap one part without also switching out the other. That's no big deal as long as one set fits your ears, but there are sure to be some people who need, for example, a bigger fin and a smaller tip. They're out of luck. This tweaked design also means you're not able to loop the cable up over your ear the way you can with other Jaybird buds. These color combinations are pretty slick. You can get the Tarah in three color combinations: Black/Flash, Solstice Blue/Glacier, and Nimbus Gray/Jade. The blue and gray sets are fun and less subdued than the finishes Jaybird generally offers. The remote on the Tarah has the same three buttons as all of Jaybird's other earbuds, and they serve the same purposes. Play/pause also controls the headset's power and answers calls, while the volume keys can skip tracks with a long press. The Google Assistant is accessed by double tapping play/pause, a departure from the previous long press method. I actually like this change; it makes more sense than having different functions mapped to each of three different press lengths. Like the X4, the Tarah are IPX7 certified, meaning they can officially handle some moisture. You can't swim in them, but they're safe for jogging in the rain. The Jaybird app is compatible with the Tarah, and it's still handy and simple to use. You can choose from several built-in sound profiles, pick from ones other users have created, or make your own, tweaking different frequencies on a graph as you see fit. The process isn't quite as seamless as on other Jaybird models, though; as I was manipulating the equalizer, changes to the sound profile were somewhat delayed, and the volume would sometimes briefly jump, which never failed to startle me. Compared to Jaybird's other offerings, the Tarah's included accessories are scant. You get the charger (yet another proprietary full-size USB dongle), three sets of silicone eargels, a shirt clip, and that's it. You won't find a carrying case or the malleable foam tips the X series ships with. The new eargels just don't fit me very well; the pre-installed medium size was easy to push too far into my ears, while the next size up was a little too big. Proprietary chargers are bogus, but I like this design more than the X4's. Sound quality In my review of the X4, I came away pleased with the sound quality the low-profile buds offered. That isn't really the case here. While the Tarah sound okay, overall, music has a slightly brittle quality to it, without much of the satisfying bass the X4 offer. When boosted with the Jaybird app, though, treble is infinitely more prominent than in the X4; maxed out, high frequency tones are absolutely piercing. Call quality is fine, too. I didn't have a problem hearing callers, and they heard me well enough. The position of the microphone can still cause some problems if you're moving around or in a noisy environment, though. Should you buy them? No — at least not at this price. Jaybird positions the $100 Tarah as an entry-level offering for people trying Bluetooth audio for the first time, and while they are cheaper than the company's flagship X4, it's not by much. The Tarah's battery is supposed to last six hours on a charge, a 25 percent reduction from the X4. In my testing, they made it through five hours and 13 minutes of continuous playback at medium volume. For as small and light as they are, that's not terrible, and it's not hard to believe they'd make it a week of normal use, but it's still disappointing that they can't reach Jaybird's target playback time. Charging them is still a pain, too — like the X3 and X4 before them, the Tarah use a proprietary clip that plugs in using full-size USB. I actually prefer the design of this charger; when attached, the Tarah's cable runs perpendicular to the dongle. It's a neater setup, but single-purpose chargers are still bad. That new design also means you can't top them up with any older Jaybird chargers you may have around. I'm just not sure who the Tarah are for. To save $30, you're sacrificing sound quality, battery life, and accessory selection. Doesn't sound like a good deal to me. Buy them If you can snag 'em at a hearty discount. Don't buy them Under just about any other circumstance. If you're on a budget, check out the Plantronics BackBeat Fit 350, which offer many of the same perks as the Tarah for $79.99. I'd be comfortable recommending these at $70 or maybe even $80, but with similar products available for less and a materially better option just $30 away, there's no real reason to buy the Tarah. You're likely to hold onto a pair of pricey Bluetooth earbuds for at least a couple of years, and a hundred bucks is hardly an impulse buy for most people. Skip a meal out and get the X4 instead.","As headphone jacks keep dying off, wireless headphones keep being relevant.

Rei Padla,"Motorola is one of those OEMs that we don’t hear from usually when it comes to financial numbers but we know the company is doing great being it’s been churning out new models regularly. Motorola is busy working on not just one but several new phones to be unveiled at the next biggest tech event–the Mobile World Congress–which is just right around the corner. We’re anticipating a number of new phones but the Samsung Galaxy S9 phones are probably the most popular at this point. Yesterday, an image was leaked that showed a possible rear fingerprint sensor for the Moto E5. There are also new Moto Mods including the Lenovo Vital and Livermorium Slider Keyboard. We want more from the brand because we believe Motorola can be trusted. Like HTC, it doesn’t slow down old phones. Android updates are also regular so you know you’re getting more value from what you’ve paid for each phone even if the price is already discounted. Moto G6 Series At this year’s Mobile World Congress happening in Barcelona, expect to see the new Moto G phones. After the G5, it’s going to be the G6 variants: Moto G6, Moto G6 Play, and Moto G6 Plus. We’ve got some images below but they haven’t been confirmed yet. Rumor has it the next-gen Moto G will be similar to the Moto X4 design complete with the 3D glass screen, all-metal build like the G5, 18:9 display, and Full HD 1080p. When it comes to processor performance, the Moto G6 will have Snapdragon 450. The Moto G6 Plus will run on Snapdragon 630. Batteries of the two will be 3200mAh and 3200mAh while the Moto G6 Play will have a bigger 4000mAh batt. Screen sizes will be 5.7-inches for the G6 and G6 Play and 5.93″ for the G6 Plus. They will differ in resolution at FHD+ or HD. The phones will have rear fingerprint readers as well. The Moto G6 will be out in silver or rose gold. The Moto G6 Plus will be ready in Dark Lake, Nimbus, and Deep Indigo aka dark teal, silver, and black. The Moto G6 Play will be sold in deep blue, gold, and dark charcoal. Price points for the three Moto G6 devices will be anything between $240 and $330. Moto X5 The Moto X5 will be more powerful than the X4. Expect a borderless 5.9-inch FHD+ 18:9 screen, notch at the top of the device, front- and rear dual camera setup, speaker, fingerprint reader at the botton, and a hidden fingerprint reader. Motorola may incorporate Smart AI. We’re guessing artificial intelligence will be available here. Moto Z3 Last but not the least is the Moto Z3 that will have an all-display design. What was first thought to be a RAZR line is now popular for its Moto Mods. There are only slight changes to the Moto Z as the next-gen Z3 will still be compatible with the older mods that are now in their third year. The phone may sport a 6-inch FHD+ 18:9 screen, and a Snapdragon 845 processor. and there is a possibility the fingerprint sensor may be embedded on the display.

https://www.facebook.com/pcgamermagazine,"Nimbus Data, a company you probably never heard of, just launched what it claims is the world's largest capacity solid state drive, the 100TB ExaDrive DC100. We'll just let that sink in for a moment. Still waiting.... In case you're having trouble wrapping your head around that amount of solid state storage, Nimbus Data provides some reference points. You could, for example, store 20 million songs on this drive, or 20,000 HD movies. We'll add to it—let's say the average Steam game is 50GB (many games take up much less space, some have even bigger footprints, but we'll use 50GB to keep the math simple). Using that as our metrics, you could squeeze 2,000 games onto the ExaDrive DC1000. Of course, this is not a solution for gaming, or even home consumers in general, but is intended for datacenters. Nevertheless, you could technically plop one of these drives into your gaming PC and be off and running. It ships in a 3.5-inch package rather than the more commonly found 2.5-inch form factor for SSDs, but uses a SATA 6Gbps interface. For datacenters, the pitch from Nimbus Data is that the HDD form factor and SATA 6Gbps interface makes it plug-and-play compatible with hundreds of storage and server platforms. The company also plans to make a version available with a SAS interface at some point. Underneath the hood are 3D NAND flash memory chips. The drive is rated to deliver up to 500MB/s of sequential read and performance, along with random reads and writes both checking in at up to 100,000 IOPS. Nimbus Data didn't mention specific pricing, only saying that it will be similar to existing enterprise SSDs on a per terabyte basis. That would likely mean $100K or more for the drive. Not that it matters for home consumers—even though these things have a tendency to trickle down into the consumer space, we suspect it will be quite some time before 100TB SSDs are mainstream.",This is the kind of drive that will tempt you to remove the recycle bin from your desktop.,2018-03-19T17:47:59Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Pcgamer.com'}",Been waiting for a 100TB solid state drive?

Epic Games likes to keep the playing field fair for matchmaking so controller players on mobile get matched with console players. Today, Season 8 arrived and Gamevice has a limited time discount on its iPhone controller.
The Gamevice iPhone controller that costs $79.99 usually is available on Amazon and Gamevice for just $49.99 for a limited time. Fortnite was already great on iOS with 60fps on many recent devices but having proper controller support as well makes it the best portable version since you don’t have to worry about tethering to another device when on the go like you do on the Switch. When it comes to controllers on iOS, the Nimbus or Gamevice are basically your only real options. If you do consider buying the Gamevice on Amazon to get the discount, buying through our links helps TouchArcade in a small way, so get an iOS controller and give us something at the same time!

Staff Post,"Sitka branched outside of its hunting market with its Train, Travel, and Work line. We reviewed the Sitka Nimbus Jacket, a lightweight and windproof option for travelers and outdoors people. In 2018, Sitka introduced a new line of apparel dubbed TTW, or train, travel, work. Across the line, the brand kept consistent with its technical hunting pieces. The TTW line boasts an array of performance shirts, bottoms, and jackets that are designed to take you from the gym to the field. The brand’s windproof option in the line, the Nimbus Jacket, is super lightweight, water-resistant, and uses Gore-Tex Windstopper shell. It’s designed to withstand wind and light rain while staying comfortable and costs $199. NOTE: The TTW line from Sitka Gear is currently only available for men and designed with an athletic fit. However, I am able to easily fit into the small sizes and have found the Nimbus Jacket to work with my female frame without any major setbacks. Sitka TTW Line: What You Get The Nimbus Jacket is one of two jackets in the TTW line. The core of the Nimbus is a Windstopper membrane that breathes very well. It prevents overheating and perspiration build-up by allowing moisture vapor to easily escape. The other jacket, the Vapor SD, $299, is built on the same ideas but uses Gore-Tex Shakedry lightweight, waterproof technology. In use, I feel the Nimbus has a leg up on the pricier Vapor SD in the area of durability with its brushed DWR finish. Review: Sitka Gear Nimbus Jacket The jacket’s mantra is that it’s built to be packed down, withstand light precipitation, and totally block the wind. I used it during farm chores, outdoor photography sessions, casual hikes, and camping trips. I found this to be true when I packed it inside a tool bucket on my way out to the fields to chainsaw up some fallen trees from a storm. The weather hovered in the mid 50’s with a strong breeze and spits of rain. If you’ve ever chainsawed anything in the brush, you know that it’s humid. I always try to avoid shells that keep the heat in and make you sweat. That’s not the case with the Nimbus. I was happy to not feel like a sauna inside that jacket, with wind blowing that could cause steady chills. Instead, it felt as if I was vented and kept the wind from slapping my neck and arms when it would gust a little. One surprise feature of the jacket was how flexible the fabric was. The brushed outer textile didn’t have that super annoying swooshy or crunchy noise most windbreakers have. The fabric stretched with me while I started the chainsaw and didn’t pull my clothes underneath. Work, Breakdown, and Stowaway At first look, the Nimbus looks like a simple jacket. But upon closer inspection, there are some awesome yet subtle features that were invaluable in the moment. During my deadfall chainsaw massacre, I employed the hood. This kept the sawdust from flying down the collar and the rain off my head. Sitka designed it with an easy adjustment on the back of the head to keep the three-panel hood in place. That’s important because if a hood is uncomfortable or ill-fitting, it’s never going to get used. Lycra material surrounds the cuffs and hood. This gives a little extra stretch. It comes in handy if you want to put on or take off the jacket while wearing work gloves and a hefty GPS or exercise watch. It also makes putting on and taking off the jacket quickly, in case of strong, sudden winds. There’s ample room to store your keys, money, or cell phone inside the interior chest pockets. When you’re on the move, it breaks down into a little ball that is practically weightless. The chest pocket holds the whole jacket when you want to store it. Sitka Gear Nimbus Jacket: Final Thoughts I will continue to test the Nimbus throughout the year, but I feel it has already proved itself to me. When chainsawing in light rain, a few cool camp nights, or using it as a protective shell while photographing in misty conditions, the jacket performed as advertised. The Nimbus Jacket’s materials and technology make it a versatile piece in my outerwear arsenal. It’s true to its brand in form and function. Many other shells are loud and trap in your body heat to the point of sweating. The Nimbus is a soft and breathable while still durable. I’d say the biggest hurdle in the purchase is the cost at $199. But the value is in the technology and details. At this price, it competes with brands like The North Face. REI Co-op offers similar jackets for about $30 less. It’s available in three colors and available from Sitka’s website and retailers.

Darren Allan,"A new SSD has grabbed the coveted title of the world’s biggest solid-state drive, offering a whopping 100TB of storage space. Nimbus Data has revealed the ExaDrive DC100 with a 100TB capacity, which the firm says is being sampled with select customers now, and it’ll hit the market with general availability in the summer. It uses 3D NAND, and to put that capacity in perspective, it’s enough space to store 20,000 HD movies. The drive is capable of sequential read and write speeds of up to 500MB/s. The company boasts that it has triple the capacity of its closest competitor on the market, and it draws 85% less power per terabyte. Supreme endurance The ExaDrive DC100 (which will also be offered in a 50TB flavor) has a five year warranty and is guaranteed for ‘unlimited endurance’ during that period. The drive has a mean time between failures of 2.5 million hours. Naturally, it won’t come cheap, although the price hasn’t yet been confirmed. Nimbus claims it will be competitive with similar heavyweight SSDs designed for data center usage, and underlines the potential savings to be made with the lower operating costs (thanks to the low power draw). As with all these whopping SSDs, these aren’t products aimed at consumers, but they are nonetheless interesting in terms of showing exactly how far capacity is being pushed. As ever, there will be a trickle-down effect from this technology which means that more affordable consumer drives will be getting proportionally bigger, too. Samsung has previously claimed that it will have a 100TB SSD available by 2020.

Dominik Schulte,"FW18 marks London-based menswear designer Kiko Kostadinov’s second ASICS collaboration. Together, they have produced the GEL-Burz 2, which takes its inspiration from the traditional pottery made in Kostadinov’s native Bulgaria and is designed to mirror the designer’s latest ready-to-wear collection. Kostadinov’s first ASICS sneaker, the chunky GEL-Burz 1 runner, was wildly popular among those sneakerheads who have helped elevate chunky “dad-shoe”-type sneakers in recent times. The new collab, built on elements of the GEL-Venture 6 and GEL-Nimbus 20 silhouettes, features ASICS’ FlyteFoam and GEL technology and replaces the translucent rubber layers of its predecessor with a pottery-inspired leather panel branded with ASICS stripes. Buyers can choose between three colorways: “seafoam,” “forest,” and “terracotta.” While this is only Kostadinov’s second ASICS collaboration, fans of the partnership can look forward to more, with the designer having previously unveiled the ASICS GEL-Delva 1, which was initially slated for a Summer 2018 release. In addition, Kostadinov outfitted models at his SS19 runway show with what has tentatively been named the “Tug of War” sneaker, which you can check out here. Highsnobiety image director NIK headed the in-house photoshoot for the Kostadinov x ASICS GEL-Burz 2, creating a series of visuals that blend elements of CGI with dozens of layered shots of the real sneaker to create images so sharp they’re beyond the perception of the human eye. In NIK’s own words, the technique “gives the whole image a synthetic, hyperreal feel that matches the high-end look of the sneaker.” A pre-launch for the sneaker took place on July 21, but sneakerheads can look forward to the GEL-Burz 2’s global release on August 10. Is Kostadinov’s new ASICS kick better than his first ASICS collaboration? Will you be copping? Let us know in the comments.

Josephine Livingstone,"Wikimedia Commons When Lana Del Rey dressed in a pierced heart and blue-winged headdress, she invoked Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows. ( On a website called Beauty So Ancient, a number of devotional objects of the Lady are advertised under the headline, “A Devotion You Can’t Afford to Ignore.”) The seven sorrows refer to the tragedies of the Virgin Mary, running from the prophecy of Simeon to the piercing of Christ’s side to his burial. It would be very unusual indeed to see the sorrowing Lady with a smile on her face as broad as Lana Del Rey’s. Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images When Katy Perry showed up in an enormous set of angel wings, she looked like a picture you could buy as “ Catholic Print Picture Large GUARDIAN ANGEL w/ boy and girl 8x10” from bonanza.com. Other celebrities took a different approach to the prompt of “Catholicism,” and associated the concept with Italian art ipso facto. This category included Amanda Seyfried, who dressed not as a Catholic but as a woman from a Botticelli allegory of spring. Botticelli himself is of course strongly associated with the kind of art you can buy on religious tote bags, since he painted so many cherubs. But the late fifteenth-century painting Primavera is a scene of classical mythology. So what is the connection Seyfried is drawing here? As with the devotional object tradition of Lana Del Rey and Katy Perry, Seyfried is drawing upon a concept of the Catholic that is in fact an art historical idea. Remembering the Council of Trent’s disdain for the “lascivious,” the disorganized, and the “indecorous,” we can see how the very notion of Southern European and erotic art forms took on a Catholicism, if you will, that in fact has little to do with its religious underpinnings. Botticelli was painting, after all, before the very split that defined “Catholicism” as something other than Christianity itself. Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Perhaps the strangest celebrity engagement with the Gala’s theme came in the form of haloes. Aside from Janelle Monae’s extremely orthodox halo, which she could have prized straight off a Byzantine icon, the fashion move of the night was to put a radiant circle on one’s head. A halo—otherwise known as an aureole, a nimbus, or a gloriole—can be seen in a variety of religious art: Ra has a solar disco over his head; Buddha often a halo; the Roman emperors were crowned in rays of light. But in Christian art, the halo has taken a few distinct forms. In medieval art, the halo went flat against the background. But as Renaissance interest in perspective grew, the halo became an aura tilted over the holy person’s head. A halo of rays with no circle was often used in medieval art to signify a beatified holy person who was not yet canonized. The ray-beam style eventually became acceptable on any holy individual, but is most often seen in Catholic art on the Virgin Mary—sometimes in the form of a circle of stars, a symbol that later transferred to the European Union—because of her role as the Woman of the Apocalypse in the Book of Revelation. The radiant, spiky halo of late Catholic object-art was seen last night over the heads of Lily Collins, SZA, Rita Ora, and Solange. Rosie Huntingdon-Whitely wore a simple round nimbus, as seen in Da Vinci’s Madonna Benois, which looked very nice.","If you search “Reformation” these days, you will find a clothing store that makes frilly dresses for girls.

Sudipta Datta,"The day Alexander Frater was born, in a small mission hospital in an island in the South West Pacific, “2.1 inches of rain fell in a space of seven hours and 12 minutes,” knocking flowers off trees and washing away top soil. As he explains in the prologue to Chasing the Monsoon (1990), his father, a doctor, told him this detail and also taught him to observe and analyse weather. Later, a picture by his bedside would lead him to “Cherrapunji: the wettest place on earth.” But before he embarked on his journey in the late 1980s, he began reading and found that the temperamental monsoon had acquired some “disturbing behavioural changes”. It had grown “spiteful... Some areas of India were paid only fleeting visits, some no visits at all. This wilfulness puzzled the weather men and frightened the politicians.” In the 21st century, the monsoon is just as capricious, but are politicians still scared? Leaving nimbus clouds aside, geopolitical writer and intrepid traveller Robert D. Kaplan drew up the importance of the Greater Indian Ocean in Monsoon (2010). “In this rimland of Eurasia... we can locate the tense dialogue between Western and Islamic civilisations, the ganglia of global energy routes, and the quiet, seemingly inexorable rise of India and China over land and sea,” he wrote. Recalling the late British historian C.R. Boxer’s words “Monsoon Asia”, Kaplan said India, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, Myanmar, Oman, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Tanzania “will demographically and strategically be a hub of the twenty first century world”; a world “where the fight for democracy, energy independence, and religious freedom will be lost or won”. He even highlighted issues like climate change and its impact. Calling attention to some of the perils lurking in the waters of the region is Amitav Ghosh’s searing narrative, The Great Derangement (2016), where he spoke of “elemental” forces that had “untethered” hundreds of people, including his ancestors, early “ecological refugees”. While writing his book set in the Sunderbans ( The Hungry Tide ), Ghosh became aware of the unique landscape. As he wrote in his notes: “I do believe... that the land is demonstrably alive; that it doesn’t exist solely, or even incidentally, as a stage for the enactment of human history; that it is [itself] a protagonist.” Here rivers change course overnight, villages disappear in a flash — and the deluge during the monsoons usually has a hand in it.",Exploring nimbus clouds and the Great Indian Ocean,2018-07-29T18:24:28Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Under the grey skies,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/under-the-grey-skies/article24547372.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,the-hindu,The Hindu,nimbus,1
Rob Thubron,"Having only held the title for a short time, Samsung can no longer claim the world’s largest-capacity SSD. Almost exactly a month since the Korean firm announced the record-breaking 30.72TB PM1643 drive, Nimbus Data has just revealed the ExaDrive DC100, which squeezes 100TB of 3D NAND flash into a 3.5-inch SATA form factor. Nimbus says the DC100 provides enough capacity to store 20 million songs, 20,000 HD movies, or 2,000 iPhones worth of data. Not only is this drive’s capacity massive, but it’s also incredibly energy efficient. The 0.1 Watts per terabyte it consumes is around 85 percent lower than its rivals. Designed for data centers, the DC100 prioritizes capacity and efficiency over speed. It features 100,000 IOPS random read/write performance and up to 500MB/sec throughput. For comparison, Samsung’s previous record holder features read and write speeds of 400,000/50,000 IOPS and 2100/700MB/sec. Nimbus says that for data centers, a single rack of DC100 SSDs can achieve over 100 petabytes of raw capacity, which should appeal to services that deal with massive amounts of data. The ExaDrive DC100, which will also come in a 50TB version, has an “unlimited endurance” guarantee for five years. It also boasts a mean time between failures (MTBF) of 2.5 million hours. Both ExaDrive DC series drives will be available this summer.

Vlad,"When it rains, it pours - at least that seems to be the case for Motorola-related leaks today. No less than four different models have been outed, from two of the company's series. And all of these could conceivably become official at MWC next month. The Moto X5 is probably the strangest of them all, with its iPhone X -like notch and white software button at the bottom of the screen. Oh, and there's no fingerprint sensor in sight anywhere. Whether that means the X5 will be the second handset ever to sport an in-display fingerprint scanner or not (following the vivo X20 Plus UD ) remains to be seen. Forgoing this authentication method completely would be a strangely Apple-emulating move on Motorola's part. Anyway, the X5 is said to come with a 5.9-inch 18:9 display with 2,160x1,080 resolution. It's unclear how its notch will work with Android notifications, or what ""Moto's Smart Ai"" may do. The phone will have a grand total of four cameras, two on each side. Finally, note that the ""moto"" branding of years past has been replaced with ""motorola"" on the front. Moving on, we have the G6 series, now with 3D glass on the back - gone is the all-metal approach of the G5 models. The G6 itself will ship with the Snapdragon 450 chipset on board, and a 5.7-inch 18:9 2,160x1,080 touchscreen. It will come with 3 or 4GB of RAM, and 32 or 64GB of storage. The dual rear cameras have 12 MP and 5 MP resolution, respectively, while a 16 MP shooter will be on the front for selfies. The Moto G6 Plus, on the other hand, has a larger 5.93"" display with the same resolution as its smaller sibling's. The cameras seem to be shared between the two, but the Plus model will also have an iteration with 6GB of RAM. It will be powered by the Snapdragon 630 SoC. The G6 has a 3,000 mAh battery, while the G6 Plus gets 3,200 mAh. The Moto G6 Play, on the other hand, wins this competition with its huge 4,000 mAh cell. The G6 Play's screen will be 5.7"" in size with 720p resolution. Fingerprint readers will be on all G6 models. The Moto G6 will be offered in black, silver, and rose gold. The G6 Plus will come in Deep Indigo, Nimbus, and Dark Lake - taking the color naming game to a whole new level indeed. The G6 Play's hues will be dark charcoal, gold, and deep blue. Price-wise, expect the G6 to retail in the US for around $240, and the G6 Plus to go for $330 or thereabouts.

Colin Stevens,"Warning: Riderless Nimbus alert. 
By Colin StevensNiantic, the developers behind Pokemon Go, have released a brief teaser for its upcoming game, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. While at first the footage might seem a bit random and out of place, there are a few hints it might give about exactly what this magical mobile game has in store.
The official Wizards Unite Twitter account posted the teaser (which can be seen below), along with a caption reading: ""Several riderless broomsticks were spotted flying off erratically in the Muggle world. Stay alert for any other cases of unexplained magical activity and sign up for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force!""
Magic in the modern Muggle world
The trailer begins with a super-brief shot of a few Nimbus 2000 broomsticks flying above a highway, and quickly cuts to some sort of identification card that a law enforcement system would use to track a case.
This one, Trace No. 74: Riderless Nimbus, has had witnesses reports of UFOs going up 90% in the area - however, none of these have been attributed specifically to broomsticks, suggesting the muggle witnesses had no idea what they really were.
Soon after, we get a better look at the speed camera that captures the brooms flying 80km/h past a sign that says Event Ahead. In the corner of the video is a bunch of data indicating this occurred in Sydney, Australia on December 14, 2018. This tells us that the game is not only set in modern times (not the 1990s like the seven Harry Potter books or the 1920s like the Fantastic Beasts films) but that it takes place in a number of Muggle-filled cities across the world.
Looking up this trace on the official Muggle Unites website brings you to a brief description that says: The Statute of Secrecy Task Force is doing everything in its power to track these rogue brooms before they are noticed by Muggle authorities. These brooms may split up in search of their natural sporting habitat, so keep an eye out around Muggle sport stadiums.""
This information, combined with the Event Ahead sign, suggests that this specific bit of footage has more in-line with possible gameplay mechanics than what might seem immediately obvious. These brooms were likely searching out a sporting event, meaning that in practice players could likely use alternate reality (AR) capabilities on their phones to see these brooms appear near these sporting events in real time, much like Niantic already does with Pokemon appearing in the wild across the world in Pokemon Go.
More than just finding Fantastic Beasts
Beyond the game taking place in a modern setting using real locations, it appears what players will be capturing arent just magical creatures, but instead magical traces that have leaked into the muggle world. In this case, its a Riderless Nimbus"" broomstick. But beyond simply pointing a phones camera toward a spot and seeing the broomstick zoom past, it looks like more player input will be necessary to capture the trace.
In Pokemon Go, players need to throw a pokeball at a Pokemon in front of them, timing and aiming it so it hits a point inside two circles. In this teaser, you can see two faint dotted arrow lines just above where the broomsticks are flying (which can be seen in the image below). Our best guess is that players will need to use touch gestures on their phones screen along with these in order to capture the trace, all while using their phone's camera and AR capabilities. Whats more, the trace identification card in the teaser shows these same lines above an illustrated broomstick.
Interestingly, because this teaser shows off a magical object rather than a creature or spell, its possible the traces that players capture could be any number of things from the Harry Potter universe. It could be a golden snitch players would draw a circle around. Maybe its the trace of a Wingardium Leviosa (NOT Levio-sah) spell which players could capture by performing some sort of swish and flick gesture on their touchscreen.
Instead of boxing in this AR title as a spell-casting game, or another creature capturing game like Pokemon Go, it could run the gamut of Harry Potter objects, spells, beasts and everything in-between. In fact, the first teaser showed a mixture of this, with a young woman using an immobilizing spell to stop a rogue snitch before catching it. The possibilities of how this game will operate are still relatively vast, though combining the information from these two teasers narrows it down considerably.
Upholding the Statute of Secrecy
Lastly, like Pokemon Go, story elements in this game will likely be kept to a minimum. However, these teasers have set up a few key tentpoles for what we can likely expect from the narrative conceit the game gives players for capturing magical traces.
Both teasers, along with the games website, revolves around enlisting in a Statute of Secrecy Task Force. The Statute of Secrecy is an international law in the Harry Potter universe that was established in 1692 and is meant to protect Muggles from magic and keep the knowledge of the wizarding world secret at all costs. This task force, then, must be searching out anomalies of magic appearing in the Muggle world and stamping it out as to not endanger everyone: this is something the website may be referring to as The Calamity.""
""Traces of magic are appearing across the Muggle world without warning and in a rather chaotic manner, the official Wizards Unite website states. ""We worry it is only a matter of time before even the most incurious Muggles catch wind of it. We call on all witches and wizards to help contain the Calamity or risk the worst of times since You Know Who. Brush up on your spells, get your wand ready, and enlist immediately.
""The Ministry is looking for witches and wizards willing to roll up their sleeves and volunteer to save the wizarding world from the Calamity. As a member of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force (a new task force formed in partnership between the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards) you will hone lightning fast wand reflexes, an ability to sniff out the faintest whiff of magical disorder from afar, and proficiency in advanced casting of multiple spells.""
This text is accompanied by the image above, showing a magic exposure threat level meter. This same meter appears in the new teaser, suggesting a difficulty level for catching the Riderless Nimbus. It could also suggest an overall exposure-level mechanic, where local or even global players might have to work together to keep an overall exposure-level from hitting Calamity,"" succeeding or failing as a group.
Looking at all of this combined - the AR mechanics operating in a modern setting, capturing magical traces that arent confined to specific categories, and acting as part of a sort of magical law enforcement group to keep wizards and witches hidden from Muggles - all suggests a dynamic, interesting experience that could be similar to Pokemon Go, but distinct enough to become its own phenomenon.

Tushar Subhra Dutta,"Nimbus Just Launched World’s Highest-Capacity SSD Recently, the tech firm, Nimbus has just introduced the world’s highest capacity SSD solid state disk with huge storage space. This SSD belongs to Nimbus’ Ultra High Capacity (UHC) product family, a range of memory units featuring a large storage space on a 3.5-inch case. Nimbus Just Launched World’s Highest-Capacity SSD A month ago we gathered that the South Korean giant Samsung was already mass producing a 30TB SSD after that 60TB SSD announced by Seagate had not materialized. Today, Nimbus Data has announced an SSD of 100 TB, which represents a new storage record. Nimbus Data ExaDrive DC100: the highest capacity SSD in history The specific model is the Nimbus Data ExaDrive DC100, which is already starting to reach customers of the company in the form of samples. Its availability is also very close, as the company has said that it will start to be available in the market. To achieve this capacity, the company has used NAND 3D MLC memories manufactured by SK Hynix (probably 64 layers, although they have not confirmed this), as well as being a 3.5-inch unit. This capacity allows to store up to 20,000 HD movies, and has sequential read and write speeds of 500 MB/s when using SATA interface, as well as 100,000 IOPS. In addition to tripling in capacity to the highest available option currently, its energy expenditure is much lower; in particular, it is 85% more energy efficient per terabyte. The unit consumes 10 watts at rest and 14 watts in operation, something similar to what a high-performance hard drive consumes, and about 5 times more than what an SSD consumes than we can have on our PC. The latter is very important for potential buyers, including data centres. The industry will be using more and more NAND Flash memories According to the company, in 2017, 40 million 3.5-inch hard drives were sold, totalling 250 million TB. Looking ahead to 2021, 10% of the new storage that is sold will make a transition to SSD with NAND Flash memories, being a potential market to conquer with this new SSD. In addition to the 100 TB unit, the company will also market a 50 TB version. Its warranty is 5 years, with a guaranteed durability of at least 2.5 million hours. Its price will not be cheap, and although the company has not announced what it will be, it is easy to estimate that it will not fall below $25,000. Over 5 years, its price is 42% lower than other enterprises SSDs. It is surprising that the company has announced that this unit will be available by this year only, of course, 2018, since the South Korean giant Samsung had stated that until the year 2020 we would not have SSD units of 100 TB. Nimbus also sells its hard drives through Viking or Smart, so we will surely see other units of this capacity being announced soon. So, what do you think about this?

Ashley Elsdon,"Luis Felipe Vieira Damiani has brought us quite a few unusual AUv3 plugins for iOS. Apps like Nimbus AU, Ringabell AU, and Csound on iOS app RunloopSound. Now he’s brought another AUv3, Moonshine AU. This is a stereo granulator effect that works both as an AUv3 plugin, and as a standalone iOS app. If you’re not familar with the term, granulation is the process of taking tiny snapshots of your sound at random deviations from a certain position in time, then combining those grains to form anything from rhythmic patterns to dense and involving clouds of sound. The effect can also add some shimmer to a vocal track, act as an out-of-the-box guitar delay, or be used to transform synth sounds into the most uncanny and very interesting pads. Moonshine AU features 13 parameters per channel, including four parameters to automate the interval at which grains are triggered, in a total massive 26 parameters to tweak and make totally original sounds. All that within the comfort of your preferred digital audio workstation on iOS. Moonshine AU is a universal app and costs $5.99:",If you're looking for a granulator then Moonshine AU could be just what you're after.

"Ignatiy Vishnevetsky on Film, shared by Ignatiy Vishnevetsky to The A.V. Club","Hal Availability Select theaters September 7 The story of Hal Ashby, the New Hollywood’s designated hippie, ended unhappily—a dispiriting 1980s comedown of forgotten features and high-profile legal problems before his death from cancer at the age of 59, having never made a comeback. But even in his ’70s heyday, Ashby cut an unlikely figure. He didn’t direct his first feature, The Landlord, until he was 40. Before that, he’d been a successful editor, and won an Oscar (his only one) for his work on In The Heat Of The Night. But he never gave the impression of being an old studio hand—or having ever worn a suit, despite ample photographic proof to the contrary. With his shoulder-length graying hair, Gandalf beard, and matching nimbus of marijuana smoke, the Ashby of the ’70s looked like a beach bum, a dropout. He chain-smoked joints on set and in the editing room and signed his production memos, “Much peace and love.” Taking swipes at the hypocritical straight world, he made offbeat movies: Harold And Maude, The Last Detail, Shampoo, Being There. Some familiarity with these and other titles is a must for anyone coming into Amy Scott’s documentary encomium Hal ; on the near-zero chance that someone who isn’t at least extremely familiar with the man’s work ends up watching the film, they will find themselves shit out of luck. That’s because, despite all of the assembled documentary bric-a-brac (extended clips, archival materials, interviews with celebrity fans and collaborators, excerpts from letters and memos read in voice-over by Ben Foster, etc.), the movie is remarkably short on necessary context—including basic plot details of some of the films in question. We get sound bites about the supposed Trump-era prescience of Being There and a story about its final shot of Peter Sellers walking across the water, but no clear idea of what the film is actually about: an illiterate gardener who becomes a political guru to the power-playing Washington elite. Nor, for that matter, is there any mention of the fact that Ashby made the film back-to-back with the forgotten Secondhand Hearts. Ashby presents a tricky case for the reassessment-minded. His career had no shortage of obscure and misbegotten entries: his early ’80s concert films for the Rolling Stones and Trans /Shocking Pinks-era Neil Young; his jobbing TV work, including the pilot for Jake’s Journey, created by Monty Python’s Graham Chapman; the troubled mid-1980s feature The Slugger’s Wife, written by Neil Simon. But Hal isn’t a deep dive. Its interviews skim the best-known films of Ashby’s career (plus the ’80s flops Lookin’ To Get Out and 8 Million Ways To Die, because, as they say, the talent was available), most of his which were recognized in their time. Some were sizable critical and commercial hits, and with the exception of Harold And Maude, his consciously kooky comedy about a May-December romance, every movie he made in the ’70s was nominated for an Oscar. He was, despite outward appearances, a respectable filmmaker. His films had antiestablishment overtones—but it’s not like the American cinema of the time was otherwise bursting with rah-rah paeans to authority, uniforms, or the government. It’s true that the suits never liked him. But compared to the other up-and-comers of the New Hollywood era—self-appointed auteurs who went way over budget and pushed harder than they could be shoved—Ashby was a pussycat. Sure, he could be erratic; ganja might have been his drug of choice, but some more sinister and snortable substances were involved, too. (Portraying Ashby as an artist in perpetual conflict with the Man, Hal acknowledges his cocaine problem without ever really acknowledging that it was a problem.) But actors seemed to appreciate his hands-off and unobtrusive style, even when the results were mixed. As Jeff Bridges bellows with full Bridges-ian enthusiasm late in the film, “You gotta look at the pudding that is coming out of this guy’s oven, man!” Much of Hal is like this: fond, inarticulate, full of fuzzy reminiscences from Ashby’s friends (including Norman Jewison, cinematographer Haskell Wexler, and Coming Home and Lookin’ To Get Out star Jon Voight) and general admiration from Ashby-influenced directors like Judd Apatow, David O. Russell, and Lisa Cholodenko. Though clearly aimed at fans, it presents only a chummy overview of his life and career, too superficial to work as a biography, an in-depth appreciation, or even a primer. Over and over, we hear about how Ashby’s films were “character-driven” or “important.” (To which one might say: It was the ’70s—what else is new?) But Hal is at a loss to explain what his “pudding” might have been—the art that set Ashby apart from his peers. To figure that out, one might be better off watching a film like The Last Detail. Or rewatching it, considering Hal ’s target audience.","The story of Hal Ashby, the New Hollywood’s designated hippie, ended unhappily—a dispiriting 1980s comedown of forgotten features and high-profile legal problems before his death from cancer at the age of 59, having never made a comeback.

Sushant Kulkarni,"23-year-old sailor Akshay Jadhav is one of the six sailors who went missing in the Kerch Strait.
It is little over a month since six Indian sailors were killed and six others went missing in the Kerch Strait after two ships caught fire while transferring fuel.
For the families of the six missing, two of whom are from Maharashtra, this has been a period of agonising wait, as the officials of the Directorate General of Shipping are saying the six sailors are still missing.
On January 21, two ships, with crew members from India, Turkey and Libya, caught fire while transferring fuel in the Kerch Strait that separates Crimea and Russia.
Baban Jadhav, father of 23-year-old sailor Akshay Jadhav, who is from Bhadale village in Kolhapur district said: This has been the most painful one month of our lives. The officials from his company, Nimbus Maritime Services, call us regularly. Or we call them sometimes, and the answer we get is the six sailors are still missing. Sometimes we feel that they are hiding things from us. We have no other option but to wait. His mother has been inconsolable after Akshay went missing, he said.
We have been told that many people jumped from the ship after the fire broke out. The agencies have searched the waters…but no one has been found till now, he added.
The sailors from India, including Akshay and Rushikesh Sakpal from Vasai, had been employed on one of the ships through Nimbus Maritime Services, a company based in Mumbai.
Captain Santoshkumar Darokar, Deputy Director General (Technical) with the office of the Directorate General of Shipping, said: We are getting regular updates from the Indian embassy in Moscow, which is getting information from the search agencies involved. As of now, all six Indian sailors are still missing. We have been told that the fire could not be brought under control as late as last week. Some sailors had jumped into the waters. As and when we receive information, it will be conveyed to the families.
An official from the Directorate General of Shipping, however, said that chances of survival are very less.
While the chances of there being any survivors are very low, the search has not concluded yet, he said, on condition of anonymity.
At the time of the fire, one of the ships, Candy, was carrying 17 crew members – eight Indian and nine Turkish sailors. The other ship, Maestro, was carrying 15 crew members, including seven Indians, seven Turkish nationals and an intern from Libya.
Akshay completed a certificate course in maritime services from Chennai after passing Class XII in the science stream. His family members said he wanted to join the Navy and was planning to start preparing for the Navy recruitment process after returning.
His contract with the company was to get over only four days after the incident took place. He was planning to return home after that.","For the families of the six missing, two of whom are from Maharashtra, this has been a period of agonising wait, as the officials of the Directorate General of Shipping are saying the six sailors are still “missing”.",2019-02-26T02:46:22Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indianexpress.com'}","Over a month after Kerch Strait ship fire, wait continues for families of missing sailors",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/over-a-month-after-kerch-strait-ship-fire-wait-continues-for-families-of-missing-sailors-5600838/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/akshay-jadhav.jpg?w=759,,Indianexpress.com,nimbus,1

Oliver Haslam,"You do not have to be too old to remember a time when an SSD, no matter how small, cost a princely sum if you wanted to get the very best performance that was on offer. Historically, choosing an SSD meant that you were ultimately choosing performance over capacity and if you are anything like us, that was an easy decision to make with mechanical drives being cheap and perfectly happy to act as data storage while an SSD ran all the apps. Now though, that is not necessary with SSD capacities continuing to grow. We now have a new king in that regard, with the world’s largest SSD now clocking in at an amazing 100TB. That SSD is the Nimbus Data ExaDrive DC100 and it is set to be available to purchase this summer, with select partners now testing the device ahead of that public launch. According to Nimbus, its new drive will utilize 3D NAND flash memory and be capable of storing huge amounts of data. If you’re a movie lover who wants the absolute quickest access to those titles, then you can fit around 20,000 of them, in HD, on this thing. With read and write speeds of 500MB/s, you’re not going to be sat around waiting for anything to start playing, either. Of course, these drives are not aimed at people like us and will instead find a home in large enterprises where sheer speed and reliability is of the utmost importance. That’s a good job too, because while we do not yet have a price for the DC100, we think it’s probably fair to say that these things will not come cheap at all.

Stephanie Mlot,"Maybe climate change isn’t all bad… Increased water vapor in Earth’s atmosphere, a consequence of human activity, makes shimmering, high-altitude clouds more visible. Noctilucent, or night-shining, clouds form some 50 miles above the planet’s surface, when water vapor freezes around specs of dust from incoming meteors. It sounds oddly romantic. The first noted observation of noctilucent clouds came after the 1885 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano, which spewed massive amounts of water vapor into the air. Sightings became more common in the 20th century, and by the 1990s, scientists began to wonder whether climate change was to blame. “We speculate that the clouds have always been there, but the chance to see one was very, very poor, in historical times,” according to lead study author Franz-Josef Lübken, an atmospheric scientist at the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics in Kühlungsborn, Germany. Using satellite observations and climate models, researchers simulated how increased greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels contributed to the formation of night-shining clouds over the past 150 years. Methane emissions in particular have increased water vapor concentrations in the mesosphere by 40 percent since the late 1800s. “Our methane emissions are impacting the atmosphere beyond just temperature change and chemical composition,” Ilissa Seroka, an atmospheric scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, D.C., told the American Geophysical Union (AGU). Noctilucent clouds over the city of Wismar, Germany in July 2015 (via Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics) “We now detect a distinct response in clouds,” Seroka, who was not involved in the study, said. Don’t expect to spot puffs of noctilucent smoke every night this season. Unlike the cumulus, stratus, cirrus, and nimbus clouds that form less than 10 miles in the sky, the night-shining phenomenon exists above the ozone layer, weather balloons, and meteors, where temperatures must be cold enough for ice crystals to form. And, they’re only visible at dawn and dusk, when the Sun illuminates them from below the horizon.

John Voorhees,"In a bit of unexpected gaming news, Sony has released PS4 Remote Play, an iOS app that allows PS4 owners to play the console’s games on an iPhone or iPad over WiFi. Although it’s a surprising development this late in the lifecycle of the PS4, it’s great to see Sony continuing to expand the ways its customers can enjoy the console.
PS4 Remote Play takes just a few minutes to set up. On your PS4, Remote Play needs to be enabled by going to Settings → Remote Play Connection Settings to make sure the Enable Remote Play checkbox is checked. In the PS4 Remote Play app, tap the ‘Start’ button and sign into your PlayStation Network account. The app will then search for your PS4, which can take a few minutes. If PS4 Remote Play fails to find your PS4, you can manually enter a code displayed on your TV to connect using the ‘Add Device’ option under Remote Play Connection Settings.
Once your iOS device is connected and registered with Sony’s remote play system, you’re ready to go. When you first connect you’ll see a short tutorial showing you how to control the PS4. In landscape mode, the buttons of a PS4 controller appear onscreen with a tap, but otherwise, fade out. The primary on-screen buttons are laid out on the left and right sides of the screen just as you find them on a PS4 controller. The shoulder and trigger buttons appear just above the PS4’s primary buttons. In portrait orientation, the controller buttons are positioned below the gameplay area.
Analog sticks are controlled using virtual thumbsticks that appear when you place your fingers on the left and right sides of the screen. The L3 and R3 buttons that are available when you press down on the analog sticks on a PS4 controller are mapped to double taps on the thumbsticks.
Playing PS4 games with virtual controls is doable, but difficult, which is why I’m glad to see that the app also supports MFi controllers like the SteelSeries Nimbus. Based on my brief testing, an MFi controller is the way to go for anything but the most basic casual game. You won’t have access the L3 and R3 buttons on a controller like the Nimbus, but it’s a far better experience overall.
Sony’s DualShock controllers aren’t supported for remote play, but as noted by Killercow on Twitter if you’re within range of your PS4, you can connect to your PS4 as one user and then connect via the PS4 Remote Play app as another user, which allows you to use a DualShock controller as the first user while still viewing the game on your iOS device:
This trick won’t work when you’re away from home, but if you’re within range of your PS4, the DualShock controller is an even better solution because there’s less lag and you have the benefit of rumble feedback.
Remote Play also supports the iOS keyboard for text entry and the microphone for chatting while you play. Another nice touch on the iPhone is that the on-screen controls provide haptic feedback, which brings the experience closer to what it’s like to use physical buttons than is possible on the iPad.
Before you get started, it’s important to keep the limitations of PS4 Remote Play in mind. By default, the app sets the resolution at 540p. On the PS4, that can be increased to 720p, but only the PS4 Pro supports 1080p resolution. There’s also an option for 360p resolution, though I wouldn’t suggest using that setting unless you’re desperate for a PS4 gaming fix. The frame rate can also be adjusted between Standard and High.
I’ve only had a short time to use PS4 Remote Play, but I’ve been impressed with the experience when using a controller over my home WiFi, which consistently delivers over 300 Mbps downstream. Despite dropped frames and periodic resolution degradation, the convenience of playing somewhere other than in front of my TV is fantastic, especially on the large screen of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. I expect to be experimenting with this app a lot in the coming weeks to see how well it works on slower connections and with a wider variety of games.
Remote Play requires iOS 12.1 or later and an iPhone 7 or 6th generation iPad or later, plus a PlayStation Network account and fast WiFi.
PS4 Remote Play is available on the App Store as a free download.","In a bit of unexpected gaming news, Sony has released PS4 Remote Play, an iOS app that allows PS4 owners to play the console’s games on an iPhone or iPad over WiFi.

Mary E. Juetten,"I am a firm believer in sharing mistakes or missteps to save others pain, whether its bar study tips, law firm management advice, or general business information. Earlier this month, I recorded an Evolve the Law podcast with Ian Connett, where we talked about the recordable hour. Not the billable hour, not utilization statistics, but recording or capturing your time regardless of billing approach. And that includes contingency fee practices and in-house lawyers. Earlier in my career, as a consultant, I helped a business redesign their business processes. One of the critical steps was to calculate improvement. These engagements were in a variety of industries, mostly outside professional services, where employees would not necessarily be tracking their time. So, I would explain that they needed to capture all hours to see where they were spending their time, as baseline data. Even it was just for the purpose of a project or process, recording hours for a day, week, or more, provides powerful information. Later in the 1990s, when I ran a training and development company that sold a customizable proprietary learning management system for installation at customers premises, we spent much time on internal process review and recordable hours. There, and the decade before, when I was a financial auditor, our projects were all flat fees. It was essential to record all time. Back then, as professional accountants, we knew that capturing hours was not just for billing, it was good management information, now referred to as data. And, apparently I cannot say this enough, your law firm is a business and all in-house attorneys are working in a business. Time is money and hours are the input currency for professionals, even when some tasks are done by technology. Today, whatever process improvement is labeled, design thinking or lean, the basic principles remain the same. If you are interested in learning more about process review, please check out my new book on Amazon here. Its a cheap and cheerful, technology-free approach to gathering information, including the recordable hour, for your law firm. As an aside, this recordable hour is part of the newly named data-driven approach to business. Recordable hours are important information for many reasons including: Law firm pricing: how can you know if your flat fee makes financial sense without knowing how many hours it takes to perform tasks? (same goes for hourly rates) In-house efficiency : how can you request more staff or technology without making the business case, where the first question will be, how much does this change save? Administrative work : how can you know if you are better off outsourcing or delegating work if you do not know how much time you spend on non-legal tasks? Client Development : how can you answer the question of how much it costs to bring on a new client or sell new services to an existing client without the hours? Profitability and Ideal Clients : Unless all the hours are captured, you can never understand where you are making money and which clients are ideal for your bottom line. In the past year, I have seen a large companys legal department put in place a new process without first capturing baseline data, including time spent on the very task that was automated. When the general counsel tries to tell the story of the return on the investment, there will be a significant data gap. The same goes for a medium-sized law firm that implemented new technology. Recently, I started a flat fee project for Nimbus Legal, as Of Counsel, and we did not have a lot of past data for this type of work. For Nimbus Legal, I am also part of the team that is working on our processes and fees, as we add more Of Counsel attorneys in 2019. Therefore, I have been recording every minute and evaluating the process as we proceed. I have broken down the overall project into tasks, in case we need to do this work in the future in some different format. This approach has allowed me to see where we went wrong in the fee estimate. For example, we underestimated both the amount of client management and the non-legal or strategy assistance, due to the type of client. If you would like to discuss, or debate, the recordable hour, please reach out on Twitter @maryjuetten or direct message any experiences that you would like to share. Also if you are interested in learning more about Nimbus Legal, please email me mary@nimbuslegal.co. #onwards. Mary E. Juetten lives on the West Coast, runs Juetten Law, and is both an American and Canadian professional accountant.

Alex McLevy,"[ This should be obvious, but in case the headline didn’t tip you off—and if not, it’s time to do some serious thinking about your reading comprehension—this post contains major spoilers for Star Wars: Episode VIII—The Last Jedi.] In addition to being a terrifically entertaining film, The Last Jedi also wisely shakes up the formula of the original trilogy. (Yes, it’s still a middle section that ends on a darker note, but there’s none of the let’s-do- A - New - Hope -again feel that defined the also-entertaining The Force Awakens.) One of the better twists comes roughly two-thirds of the way through the film, when Supreme Leader Snoke has captured Rey, and is exhorting his pupil Kylo Ren to execute her. In a clever moment, Kylo instead triggers the lightsaber at Snoke’s side, cutting him in half and thereby eliminating the ostensible primary villain of the story while simultaneously setting up Kylo Ren to be a much more powerful and menacing figure now that he’s seized control of The First Order. (Also, that reversal gives us the best fight scene of the film, when Rey and Ren team up to take out Snoke’s Elite Praetorian guard.) And now, in a new interview with Entertainment Weekly, director Rian Johnson explains the decision to kill Snoke was essentially the driving narrative development of the entire story, the one thing he realized needed to happen to raise the stakes. “When I was working on the character of Kylo, I came to a place where I thought the most interesting thing would be to knock the shaky foundation out from under him at the beginning of this movie. By the end of this film, he’s gone from being a wannabe Vader to someone who is standing on his own feet as a complex villain taking the reins.” But in evolving Kylo in that manner, he realized something needed to be done about the former Jedi apprentice’s boss. Once he realized Kylo’s growth would be a “really good setup going into the next movie,” it led naturally to a choice about the Supreme Leader. “That made me realize the most interesting thing would be to eliminate that dynamic between the ‘emperor’ and pupil, so that all bets are off going into the next one. That also led to the possibility of this dramatic turn in the middle, which could also be a really powerful connection point between Kylo and Rey.” It also smartly sidesteps the whole “redemption by turning on his master” idea that would’ve just echoed the end of Return Of The Jedi, instead having Kylo’s murder of Snoke be part of a larger grab for serious power. If you had a bunch of theories about Snoke’s origin, or his plans for Rey and the First Order, Johnson doesn’t want you to feel stupid. It’s just that he didn’t see any place for it in his film. “It would have stopped any of these scenes dead cold if he had stopped and given a 30-second speech about how he’s Darth Plagueis. It doesn’t matter to Rey. If he had done that, Rey would have blinked and said, ‘Who?’ And the scene would have gone on.” (Because this is an interview on the internet, Johnson immediately adds, “And I’m not saying he’s Darth Plagueis!”) He agrees that coming up with theories about characters is “part of the fun of being a Star Wars fan,” and doesn’t dissuade anyone from doing so, but maybe let’s all be glad someone who thinks every major character needs a lengthy expository scene revealing their entire history isn’t directing these things. Johnson also discusses things like the conclusion to Luke Skywalker’s story (as well as some words from Mark Hamill about coming to terms with the end of that character’s arc), but we’re going to go ahead and predict that Luke will show up wearing the glowing blue nimbus of a fallen Jedi master at some point during Episode IX —if only to play straight man to Yoda’s laughs again.","[ This should be obvious, but in case the headline didn’t tip you off—and if not, it’s time to do some serious thinking about your reading comprehension—this post contains major spoilers for Star Wars: Episode VIII—The Last Jedi.] Read more...",2017-12-18T15:59:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Avclub.com'}",Rian Johnson explains his motivation for the death of [REDACTED] in The Last Jedi,https://www.avclub.com/rian-johnson-explains-his-motivation-for-the-death-of-1821385113,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ZnGqbJc8--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/g6geyx5e2ywtdnyiifb4.jpg",,Avclub.com,nimbus,1

Conor Hale,"Gilead Sciences’ senior director of clinical research, Adrian Ray, has moved over to Nimbus Therapeutics to become its senior vice president of discovery biology. After 15 years at Gilead, Ray will help advance Nimbus’ programs aimed at underlying targets that link oncology, immunology and metabolic disease. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based in silico drug discoverer has been focusing on tyrosine kinase 2 and the stimulation of interferon genes, or STING, including under an immunology collaboration with Celgene. “Adrian is a capable leader in target discovery throughout the metabolic-oncology-immunology target space, and in the translation of these discoveries into effective clinical development strategies.

Late last year, Gilead said higher doses of its NASH drug, GS-0976—which Nimbus moved from initial screening to phase 1 in 16 months—had seen statistically significant reductions in liver fat after three months in a phase 2 study. That news followed positive proof-of-concept data from April 2017, as well as a $200 million research milestone payout.

Nimbus’ preclinical Tyk2 program signals pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors that provide targets in several auto-immune disorders including lupus, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and others. Separately, STING agonists play a role in antitumor immunity, while STING antagonists may also have therapeutic potential in diseases such as lupus where it fuels an interferon response.

Chris Gonzales,"It’s been over a year since we published our review of the SteelSeries Nimbus, an MFi-certified wireless game controller that works with all iOS devices, Mac computers, and both the 4th-gen Apple TV and Apple TV 4K. I’ve been keeping my eye on the market ever since, and I have to say, the Nimbus is still the premier option. This is the closest you’re gonna get to console-level gaming on Apple devices, especially if you also pick up a Lightning-to-HDMI adapter to connect your iPhone or iPad to your TV. It’s comfortable to hold and play with, the rechargeable battery lasts up to 40 solid hours of gameplay, the buttons are pressure-sensitive for games that support such things, and it makes playing certain games about 1000x easier. About the only downsides are 1) the joysticks don’t click in like buttons (and even that’s not too big a deal), and 2) the joystick layout could be better, as mentioned in the review: Speaking of Sony’s controller design, the analog sticks on the Nimbus use the same inferior matched placement as the DualShock line instead of Microsoft’s offset style which places the primary movement stick above the d-pad. The Nimbus, with its matched sticks, inherits the increased fatigue and feeling of constant reaching, especially on the left side which are standard for Playstation gamers. The sticks themselves respond well and show neither flimsy wobble nor excessive resistance. The SteelSeries Nimbus is $43 on Amazon. If you’re wondering about game compatibility, they have a free companion app that keeps an up-to-date list of controller-supported games on the App Store.

Nick Sullivan,"Certificate Transparency (CT) is an ambitious project to help improve security online by bringing accountability to the system that protects HTTPS. Cloudflare is announcing support for this project by introducing two new public-good services: Nimbus : A free and open certificate transparency log Merkle Town : A dashboard for exploring the certificate transparency ecosystem In this blog post we’ll explain what Certificate Transparency is and how it will become a critical tool for ensuring user safety online. It’s important for website operators and certificate authorities to learn about CT as soon as possible, because participating in CT becomes mandatory in Chrome for all certificates issued after April 2018. We’ll also explain how Nimbus works and how CT uses a structure called a Merkle tree to scale to the point of supporting all trusted certificates on the Internet. For more about Merkle Town, read the follow up post later today. Trust and Accountability Everything we do online requires a baseline level of trust. When you use a browser to visit your bank’s website or your favorite social media site, you expect that the server on the other side of the connection is operated by the organization indicated in the address bar. This expectation is based on trust, and this trust is supported by a system called the web Public Key Infrastructure (web PKI). From a high level, a PKI is similar to a system of notaries who can grant servers the authority serve websites by giving them a signed object called a digital certificate. This certificate contains the name of the website, the name of the organization that requested the certificate, how long it’s valid for, and a public key. For each public key, there is an associated private key. In order to serve an HTTPS site with a given certificate, the server needs to prove ownership of the associated private key. Sites obtain digital certificates from trusted third parties called Certificate Authorities (CAs). CAs validate the operator’s ownership of a domain before issuing them a certificate. If the issuing CA for a certificate is trusted by the browser, then that certificate can be used to serve content over HTTPS to visitors of the site. All this happens under the hood of the browser and is only surfaced to user by the little green lock in your address bar, or a nasty error message if things go wrong. The Web’s PKI is an elaborate and complicated system. There are dozens of organizations that operate the certificate authorities trusted by popular browsers. Different browsers manage their own “root programs” in which they choose which certificate authorities are trusted. Becoming a trusted CA often requires passing an audit ( WebTrust for CAs ) and promising to follow a set of rules called the Baseline Requirements. These rules are set by a standards body called the CA/Browser forum, which consists of browsers and CAs. Each root program has their own application process and program-specific guidelines. This system works great, until it doesn’t. As a system of trust, there are many ways for the PKI to fail. One of the risks inherent in the web PKI is that any certificate authority can issue any certificate for any website. That means that the Hong Kong Post Office can issue a certificate valid for gmail.com or facebook.com, and every browser will trust it. This forces users to put a lot of faith in certificate authorities and hope they don’t misbehave by issuing a certificate to the wrong person. Even worse, if a CA gets hacked, then an attacker could issue any certificate without the CA knowing, putting users at an even greater risk. If someone manages to get a certificate for a site that isn’t theirs, they can impersonate that site to its visitors and steal their information. To get a sense of how many CAs are trusted by popular browsers, here’s the list of the 160 trusted CAs in Firefox. Microsoft and Apple maintain their own lists, which are comparably long (Cloudflare keeps track of these lists in our cfssl_trust repository). By trusting all of these organizations implicitly when you browse the internet, users bear the risk of certificate authority misbehavior. What’s missing from the PKI is accountability. If a mis-issued certificate is used to target an individual, there is no feedback mechanism to let anyone know that the CA misbehaved. This is not a theoretical situation. In 2011, DigiNotar, a Dutch CA, was hacked. The hacker used their access to the CA to issue a certificate for *.google.com. They then attempted to use this certificate to impersonate Gmail and targeted users in Iran in an attempt to compromise their personal information. The attack was detected by Google using a technique called public key pinning. Key pinning is a risky technique and only viable for very technically savvy organizations. The value provided by key pinning is usually overshadowed by the operational risk it introduces. It’s often considered the canonical example of a “foot gun” mechanism. Key pinning is being deprecated by browsers. If key pinning is not the solution, what can be done to detect CA malfeasance? This is where Certificate Transparency comes in. The goal of CT is to make all certificates public so that mis-issued certificates can be detected and appropriate action taken. This helps bring accountability to balance the trust we collectively place in the fragile web PKI. Shining a light Creative Commons Zero (CC0) - angele-j If all certificates are public, then so are mis-issued certificates. Certificate Transparency brings accountability to the web PKI using a technology called a blockchain an append-only public ledger, an ordered list. It puts trusted certificates into a list and makes that list available to anyone. That sounds easy, but given the decentralized nature of the internet, there are many challenges in making this a reliable bedrock for accountability. The CT ecosystem is an extension of the PKI that introduces additional participants and roles. Along with browsers and CAs, new parties are introduced to play a role in the overall health of the system. These parties are: Log operators Auditors Monitors At a high level, a log operator is someone who manages the list of certificates than can only be added to. If someone submits a browser-trusted certificate to a log, it must be incorporated into the list within a pre-set grace period called a maximum merge delay (MMD), which is usually 24 hours. The log gives the submitter back a receipt, called a Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT). An SCT is a promise to include the certificate in the log within the grace period. You can interact with a CT log via the CT API (defined in RFC 6962 ). An auditor is a third party that keeps log operators honest. They query logs from various vantage points on the internet and gossip with each other about what order certificates are in. They’re like the paparazzi of the PKI. They also keep track of whether an SCT has been honored or not by measuring the time it took between the SCT’s timestamp and the corresponding certificate showing up in the log. Along with being a dashboard, the Merkle Town backend is also an auditor; it has even detected issues in other logs. A monitor is a service that helps alert websites of mis-issuance. It crawls logs for new certificates and alerts website owners if a new certificate is found for their domain. Popular monitors include SSLMate’s CertSpotter and Facebook’s Certificate Transparency Monitoring. Cloudflare is planning on offering a free log monitoring service integrated into the Cloudflare dashboard for customers by the end of the year. Letting browsers know that certificates are logged One way to push the web to adopt CT is for browsers to start requiring website certificates to be logged. Validating that a certificate is logged by querying logs directly when a connection is made is a potential privacy issue (exposing browser history to a third party), and adds latency. Instead, a better way to ensure that a certificate is logged is to require the server to present SCTs, the inclusion receipts described in the last section. There are multiple ways that an SCT can be presented to the client. The most popular way to is to embed the SCTs into the certificate when it’s issued. This involves the CA submitting a pre-certificate, a precursor to a certificate, to various CT logs to obtain SCTs before finalizing the certificate. For certificates that don’t have SCTs embedded, a server has other mechanisms to transmit SCTs to the client. SCTs can be included in the connection as a TLS extension, or in a stapled OCSP response. These mechanisms are more difficult to do reliably, but they allow any certificate to be included in CT. A certificate with embedded SCTs Browser CT requirements Not all logs are created equally. A malicious CA could collude with a set of logs to create a certificate and a set of SCTs and not ever incorporate the certificate into the logs. This certificate could then be used to attack users. To protect the ecosystem from collusion risks, the browsers that support CT have chosen to only accept SCTs from a list of vetted logs that are actively audited. There are also diversity requirements: logs should be managed by different entities on different infrastructures to avoid collusion and shared outages. Connections are said to be “CT Qualified” if they provide the client with enough SCTs from vetted logs to suit the risk profile of the certificate. In order for a connection to be CT qualified in Chrome, it has to follow Chrome’s CT Policy. For most certificates, this means an SCT needs to be presented for at least one Google and one non-Google log trusted by Chrome. Long-lived certificates more than two SCTs. In order to become trusted by Chrome, a CT log must submit itself for inclusion and pass a 90 day monitoring period in which it must pass some stringent requirements including the following: Have no outage that exceeds an MMD (maximum merge delay) of more than 24 hours Have 99% uptime, with no outage lasting longer than the MMD (as measured by Google) Incorporate a certificate for which an SCT has been issued by the Log within the MMD Maintain the append-only property of the of the Log by providing consistent views of the Merkle Tree at all times and to all parties The full policy is here. The complete list of vetted logs is available here. Nimbus, Cloudflare’s family of CT logs, was included in Chrome 65, which is the current stable version of the Browser. All or nothing Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 - Gorskiya CT only protects users if all certificates are logged. If a CA issues a certificate that is not logged in CT and will be trusted by browsers, then users can still be subject to targeted attacks. For the last few years, Chrome has required all Extended Validation (EV) certificates to be CT qualified. Cloudflare has been making sure all that connections to Cloudflare are CT Qualified for Chrome and have been since May 2017. This is done using an automatic submission service related to our recent OCSP stapling project and the SCT TLS extension. We monitor whether or not the set of SCTs we provide is conformant with browser policies using the Expect-CT header, which reports client errors back to our servers. Expect CT is included in every HTTPS response Cloudflare serves. This isn’t enough. As long as there are certificates that are trusted by browsers that are not required to be CT Qualified, then users are at risk. This is why the Chrome team announced that they will require Certificate Transparency for all newly issued, publicly trusted certificates starting in April 2018. The safest way to make sure a certificate is always CT qualified when shown to a browser is to embed enough SCTs from vetted logs to conform to the browser’s policy. This is a big operational change for some CAs, because It adds the additional step of having to understand which SCTs are required for different browsers’ CT policies and keeping up to date with policy changes It adds a step in the issuance process where pre-certificates are to different logs before the certificate is issued Some CT logs may have outages or be slow to respond, so fallback strategies may be required to not delay issuance If you’re a CA operator and are struggling to implement this or worried about the additional delay caused by submitting pre-certificates to logs, Cloudflare can help. We’re offering an experimental API for CAs that takes pre-certificates and returns a valid set of SCTs for a given certificate. This API handles sorting out the browser policies and leverages Argo Smart Routing to return SCTs with as little delay as possible. Please contact our CT team at ct-logs@cloudflare.com if you have any interest in this offering. Building a verifiable globally consistent log The PKI is huge. The industry-wide push for HTTPS has introduced millions of new certificates into the web PKI. There are over a quarter-billion(!) certificates logged in CT, and this number is growing by almost a million per day. This number is sure to grow as we approach Chrome’s April deadline. Managing a high availability database of this size that you can only add to (a property called append-only) is a substantial engineering challenge. The naïve data structure to use for an append-only database is a hash chain. In a hash chain, elements are aligned in order and combined using a one-way hash function like SHA-256. The diagram below describes how a hash chain is created from a list of values d1 to d8. Start with the first element, d1, which is hashed to a value a, which then becomes the head of the chain. Every time an element is added to the chain, a hash function is computed over two inputs: the current chain head and the new element. This hash value become the new chain head. Because one-way hash functions can’t be reversed, it’s computationally infeasible to change a value without it changing the entire chain that has been computed from it. This makes a hash chain’s history very difficult to modify maliciously. A hash chain is the optimal data structure for inserting new elements: only one hash needs to be computed for each element added. However, it is not an efficient data structure for validating whether an element is correctly included in a chain given a chain head. In the example below, there are six additional elements (b, d4-d8) needed to validate that d3 is correct on a chain of 8 values. You need approximately n/2 elements to verify an average element in a chain of length n. In computer science terms, this is called “linear scaling.” When building a system, it’s best to try to reduce complexity for the participants involved. For CT, the main participants we care about are the log operator and the auditor. If we were to choose a hash chain as our data structure, the job of the log operator would be easy but that of the auditor would be very hard. We can do better. When you ask a computer scientist how to optimize an algorithm, nine out of ten times, the solution they will suggest is to use a tree (the other 1/10 times, they’ll suggest a Bloom filter ). That’s exactly what we can do here. Specifically, we can use a data structure called a Merkle Tree. It’s like a hash chain, but rather than hashing elements in a line, you hash them in pairs. For each new element, instead of hashing it into a running total, you arrange the elements into a balanced binary tree and compute the hash of the element with its sibling. This gives you half as many hashes as elements. These hashes are then arranged in pairs and hashed together to create the next level of the tree. This continues until you have one element, the top of the tree; this is called the tree head. Adding a new value to a Merkle tree requires the modification of at most one hash per level in the tree, following the path from the element up to the tree head. The depth of a binary tree is logarithmic with respect to the number of elements. Roughly speaking, if the tree size is 8 = 2^3, then the depth is 4 (= 3+1), if it’s 1024 = 2^10 then the tree depth is 11 (= 10+1), for 1048576 = 2^20 the tree size is 21 (= 20+1). The cost of insertion is at most log_2(size), which is worse than in a hash chain, but generally not too bad. What makes the Merkle tree so useful is the efficiency of element validation. Instead of having to compute n/2 hashes like in a hash chain, you only need the elements in the tree that lead you to the root. This is called the co-path. In the diagram below, the co-path is computed for d3. The copath consists of one value per level of the tree. The computation necessary to prove that an element is correct (an inclusion proof) is therefore logarithmic, not linear as in the case of a hash tree. Both insertion and validation are cheap relative to the size of the tree, making a Merkle tree the ideal data structure for CT. A certificate transparency log is a Merkle tree where the leaf elements are certificates. Each log has a private key that it uses to sign the current tree head at regular intervals. Some CT logs are huge with over a hundred million entries, but because of the efficiency of Merkle trees, inclusion proofs only require around 30 hashes. This structure provides a good balance between the cost to the log operator of adding certificates and the cost to the auditor of validating its consistency. Nimbus Our own addition to the log ecosystem is Nimbus. Nimbus is a family of Certificate Transparency logs with an open acceptance policy. Nimbus accepts any certificate that is signed by a CA from our cfssl_trust root store. The logs are organized by year, e.g. Nimbus 2018, Nimbus 2019, etc. with each log only accepting certificates that expire in that year. ![image8-1](/content/images/2018/03/image8-1.png =250x) Nimbus is built with Trillian a Go-based implementation of a scalable Merkle tree. The data backend is custom, re-using components from Cloudflare’s high capacity logging infrastructure, which runs entirely on Cloudflare’s bare metal infrastructure. Having a high-reliability and completely open log that is not dependent on shared Cloud Infrastructure. Nimbus is intended to bring diversity and stability to the CT ecosystem, and in the end, make the internet safer for everyone.",Certificate Transparency (CT) is an ambitious project to help improve security online by bringing accountability to the system that protects HTTPS.

Ron Duwell,"When it comes to Dragon Ball Z, I’m a huge fan of the first two story archs. Before Androids, before Gods, before stupid dancing, merged forms, and most importantly, before Super Saiyans, all had a story where a group of characters had a goal of saving their planet from invading aliens, and then taking their fight to an intergalactic tyrant while looking for Dragon Balls to revive their friends. Nice, simple storytelling that never once seemed like it was being written on the fly. That’s why the inclusion of these new characters to Dragon Ball FighterZ has me excited to buy the game and the DLC. Seeing as Base Goku enter the fight on the back of the Flying Nimbus and busting out the Kaio-ken technique tickles my nostalgia, and seeing Base Vegeta sporting his original Saiyan armor takes me back to the very first time I watched the show, back in the Rock the Dragon” era, back when there was a variety of fun techniques and abilities that didn’t lean on changing the color of their hair.

Lory Gil,"There are a handful of game controllers that are specifically designed for Apple TV — that is, they have at least one or two buttons that are assigned to the Apple TV's interface. The best two on the market are the Nimbus by SteelSeries and the HoriPad Ultimate by Hori. They're so incredibly similar in style and features that you start to wonder which one you should buy. It really all comes down to personal preferences. Here is a list of the features that are similar and different and how that translates to which Apple TV controller you should buy. See at Apple The look and feel When it comes to the physical shape and button pressure of the Nimbus and Horipad Ultimate are very similar, but there are a few minor differences that could have a major impact on your gaming experience. Button positioning It's a very subtle difference, but the Nimbus D-pad, joysticks, and ABXY buttons are all a fraction of an inch closer to reach than the Ultimate. It's such a small difference that I can't even figure out where the dimensions differ. I think it has something to do with the width of the grips. The Horipad Ultimate's grip is a slight bit fatter, which makes your thumb's reach just a tick longer. If your hands are on the smaller side, the buttons on the Nimbus will feel more natural to you. If you've got a nice sized palm, the Nimbus might feel a bit cramped. The shoulder triggers on the Horipad Ultimate are slightly higher than the triggers on the Nimbus. The difference is almost indistinguishable, but it's there. If you've got short fingers, the triggers on the Nimbus are a little more comfortable. If you've got those pianist fingers, the Ultimate is a better fit. The shoulder buttons on the Horipad Ultimate, oddly, have a closer reach than the shoulder buttons on the Nimbus. This also has to do with the dimensions of the grip, but it's interesting that it's the opposite of the other button positioning. Overall, in terms of button positioning, if your hands are on the smaller side — if your fingers are a little shorter or your palms aren't particularly wide, the Nimbus will feel more natural. If you've got long fingers, wide palms, or consider your hands to be on the larger side, the Horipad Ultimate is going to fit you better. Grip The grip is probably the most different physical aspect of each controller. The Nimbus grips are long, jut out straight from the base with only a slight downward angle, and don't have any variation in the width. They're rounded and thick. The Horipad Ultimate's grips are a bit shorter, have a noticeable downward slope, and have variation in the width, starting with a very fat bottom (where your palm and ring and pinky fingers would rest) and thinning out where your middle finger would naturally sit. Basically, the Horipad Ultimate has better ergonomic shape, but the Nimbus has more room for all of your fingers. As far as grip is concerned, the Horipad Ultimate works better for people with hands that are average or slightly smaller than average. The Nimbus has more room for larger hands, but less ergonomic structure. Button pressure Button pressure is definitely a personal preference. Some people like a stiff button that really feels like it's working. Others prefer a loose button that makes it feel like you're pressing faster. The ABXY buttons and the D-pad on both the Horipad Ultimate and the Nimbus are nearly identical, with the Nimbus having an ever-so-slightly looser pressure. Where the main button pressure difference is noticeable is in the shoulder triggers. The Horipad Ultimate triggers have significantly more resistance when pressed, giving you more pressure to work with. The Nimbus buttons are decidedly loose and don't use much pressure at all. As far as the main buttons are concerned — the D-pad, joysticks, and ABXY buttons — there is no difference. If you're trigger happy, note that the Horipad Ultimate is the pick for fans of stiff button pressure and the Nimbus is better for fans of low button pressure. The performance As far as pairing is concerned, I found that the Nimbus was about one-step faster at setting up right out of the box. The Horipad Ultimate required me to actually press the Bluetooth button in order to make it discoverable, while the Nimbus was discovered the moment I turned it on. I tried testing both controllers out on a variety of different games in order to compare reaction and latency. Turns out, there isn't any difference at all. If performance is your most important concern when it comes to a controller for Apple TV, you're not going to see any problems with either. They both use Bluetooth 4.1 and don't have any issues with buttons not working or triggering late. The battery life SteelSeries claims that the Nimbus will supply you with 40 gaming hours before needing a recharge. Hori claims an 80-hour battery life, though it's not made clear whether that means 80 gaming hours or 80 hours of regular use (like for navigating tvOS, too). As of this writing, I've not fully tested the battery capacity of the Hori's claim of 80 hours, but I can say with relative confidence that the Nimbus does hover at about 40 gaming hours. Device compatibility Another place where both the Horipad Ultimate and the Nimbus are pretty much identical. They are both compatible with Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, and Mac. They both use a Lightning-to-USB charging cable (which is not included, so you'll need to use the one that comes with your iPhone or iPad). They both connect to your devices using Bluetooth and pair pretty much the same way. If having a game controller that is universally supported across all of your Apple devices is most important to you, the Horipad Ultimate and Nimbus are the same. Who should buy the SteelSeries Nimbus? Though the buttons are closer together, which might be uncomfortable for larger-handed people, in my opinion, the Nimbus is the better fit for average to larger-than-average hands. It's all about that grip. The Nimbus grips have a lot more room for wide palms and thick fingers. If you've got short fingers, the Nimbus has a closer reach to those buttons. Even though the grips are more comfortable for larger palms, the close button configuration might be worth sacrificing the ergonomic grip. If you prefer low-pressure, fast-action button pressing, the Nimbus triggers are noticeably faster (though the D-pad and ABXY buttons aren't particularly different). If you've got fairly standard access to a Lightning cable, the 40 gaming hours of battery life will not interrupt your gameplay. See at Apple Who should buy the Horipad Ultimate? If your palms are not too big, and you're more comfortable with a rounded ergonomic grip, you're going to be happier with the Horipad Ultimate than the Nimbus. The grip length is shorter, but really is more comfortable all around. If you've got long fingers, the reach of the joystick, D-pad, and ABXY buttons are just a little farther out. This is going to make your gaming experience more comfortable. The Nimbus might feel too cramped. If you like your buttons to be a bit more on the stiff side, giving you just the right amount of resistance to give you that solid sense of action, the triggers on the Horipad Ultimate will give you the experience you want (though the D-pad and ABXY buttons, aren't really any different). If HoriPad's claim of 80 hours of battery life is true, you might consider it over the Nimbus if charging using a Lightning cable is a real pain in the butt. See at Apple Your experience? Do you own one, the other, or both the Nimbus and the Horipad Ultimate? Which one do you prefer and why? Let us know in the comments.","When two controllers are so much alike, how do you figure out which one you should buy?

Dennis Perkins,"“My God, this changes one thing.” That’s the last joke of The Joel McHale Show With Joel McHale, as—you guessed it—host Joel McHale, having presented a strikingly familiar half-hour of reality TV mockery and genial snarkiness, spots a familiar face. And body. It’s a hairy fellow in an unnecessarily revealing bathing costume, who McHale greets as “Manki—,” before being cut off and prevented from infringing upon E!’s intellectual property. It would appear that Mankini One Piece Man (for such is now his name, played by former The Soup writer turned The Joel McHale Show With Joel McHale writer, Dominic DeLeo) is just one of the elements of McHale’s old series to make the leap to Netflix. It’s a winking capper to this streaming simulacrum of The Soup that changes essentially nothing of substance, but remains as disposably winning as ever. ""Pickler, Pebbles, Pillows, And Priestley"" Sure, there are a few new wrinkles in the “watch a ridiculous clip and make fun of it” formula in this first of what’s to be a 13-episode season. McHale—sporting a relaxed-fit denim wardrobe and the same twinkly asshole shtick that made him a pre- Community star—still culls the most mockable content from reality and talk shows and internet clips. But he and his writers (and executive producer Paul Feig) have also set their sights across the seas this time out, with an emphasis in this first outing on content from places as far afield as South Africa, “Regular Africa,” and South Korea. (Whose soap operas, a montage hilariously demonstrates, have a whole “people getting graphically creamed by cars” theme that’s worth looking into.) And McHale’s new network home provides a fresh target for the comic’s genially impertinent punching-up (the show-starting ‘bum-bum” sound effect plays every time the net’s name is mentioned), along with plenty of cameos from McHale’s new network co-denizens. During a backstage tour of what McHale dubs “The legendary ‘what’s that smell?’ district,” Luke Cage ’s Mike Colter helpfully offers his services opening everyone’s pickle jars, while fellow Netflix-ians and former Community pals Alison Brie and Jim Rash do a funny bit bearing the brunt of McHale’s thoughtless jackassery. (“Fuck, I miss Chevy,” deadpans Brie after McHale calls her “Gillian.”) But The Joel McHale Show With Joel McHale is all about—wait for it—Joel McHale, and for fans of the once and possibly future Jeff Winger, McHale’s return to his reality TV-mocking roots provides all the unfiltered Joel McHale they could ask for. While the idea of McHale scurrying back to the safety of his breakout success in the wake of the failure of his largely unheralded Community follow-up The Great Indoors is hard to disregard completely, The Joel McHale Show With Joel McHale largely defuses such criticism with cheery self-awareness. McHale makes plenty of jokes about the essentially inessential nature of taking apart completely inessential reality shows and the like—and his own part in the enterprise. After Colter sighs, “It finally happened. [Netflix] ran out of ideas,” McHale beams into the camera, “Yes. Yes they did.” Apart from their Community connection, there was an aptness to McHale’s casting as Chevy Chase in the recent Doug Kenney Biopic, A Futile And Stupid Gesture. Like Chase before him, McHale dials up a self-impressed anti-comic persona to spotlight the ridiculousness of both the world of dummies around him, and the very act of doing so itself. What McHale has that Chase increasingly lacked during his long career is an equally skeptical perspective on himself, making McHale’s Chase-inspired schtick go down much easier. (Something that can’t be said for someone like Daniel Tosh, whose own The Soup -aping series sees comic smirking taken to punchable extremes.) Even the ironically self-aggrandizing title of McHale’s show carries long-ago echoes of Chase’s SNL catchphrase, “I’m Chevy Chase, and you’re not,” although McHale’s beaming braggadocio comes bearing its own self-targeting punchline. Indeed, Joel McHale is comfortably at home here as Joel McHale, snapping off jokes at the expense of table-flipping, vapidly confessional entertainments like The Bachelor, Love &amp; Hip Hop: Miami, and the like with his breezily confident to-camera mugging. In his enjoyable return, the ever-present green screen nimbus surrounding McHale as he roasts the already-overheated dregs of exceedingly expendable TV seems to wink right along with the host’s undeniable charm, making McHale’s sarcastic skewering as amiably fun as ever. Stray observations “This might stop being funny a couple of times, but don’t worry, it circles back.” There is actually one final joke, in the form of an end theme that mocks Netflix’s irritating disregard for end titles. It’s the sort of cheeky feeding-hand biting that’s right in McHale’s wheelhouse. Other guest stars on this series premiere: Fuller House ’s Jodie Sweetin (calling McHale’s relatively tentative 13-episode order “cute”); Rory Scovel (taking a couple of smacks to the face from Feig); Jason Priestley (doing some good-sported self-mockery while plugging his new ION show), Kevin Hart (waking up the sleeping McHale to get the show rolling); and Paul Reiser (chilling in the Upside Down, which hosts Netflix’s auxiliary snack table).","“My God, this changes one thing.” Read more...",2018-02-18T10:54:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Avclub.com'}",Netflix's The Joel McHale Show With Joel McHale brings back just the right vehicle—for Joel McHale,https://www.avclub.com/netflixs-the-joel-mchale-show-with-joel-mchale-brings-b-1823112340,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--iUvJUMp6--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_450,q_80,w_800/zu1jgnhr0qc2u58wcitd.png",,Avclub.com,nimbus,1
Allison Schiff,"Two years ago, the Timehop app which aggregates and resurfaces old social media photos was running on the remaining fumes of its VC cash, enough to stay afloat for just three months. It needed revenue, and, although it had 20 million monthly active users, its inventory was severely undervalued. We had no real revenue to speak of, said company COO Rick Webb, who joined in 2016 to help the cash-strapped app get back in the black. So, Timehop turned to programmatic advertising, but soon hit a wall or, rather, a waterfall. The first problem was that third-party mediation partners couldnt handle Timehops inventory, which was mostly full-screen vertical Snap-style fare. That limited the type of demand Timehop could source to mainly native, which meant fill rates were fairly low for its proprietary units. Even more vexing were the vendors that aggressively pushed SDK integrations like drug dealers in a back alley. The ad networks all made big promises. Theyd say things like, Just put us in and youll see a huge increase in CPMs and performance, dont worry about it,' said David Leviev, Timehops director of programmatic and partnerships. Timehop, however, did worry about it. There was clearly a lot of money being left on the table. So, a little over a year ago, Timehop decided to build an ad server of its own to support unified auctions. Lucky for Timehop, a small pub-tech company called PubGears was shutting its doors and several of its experienced engineers were looking for work. In November 2017, after going heads down for a few months, Timehop launched its ad server beta, which they named Nimbus after the chief engineers chinchilla. Nimbus was a significant engineering investment for a company with only 15 employees, but the results were well worth the effort. Daily revenue increased twelvefold during the holiday season, leveling out three months later to around seven times pre-Nimbus revenue. Timehop kept tweaking its server, implementing VPAID and MRAID formats, adding in a bunch of DSPs and setting up Moat via the open measurement SDK. But the most value by far came from hosting unified auctions. The problem before Nimbus was that buyers were just guessing what our inventory was worth, said Timehop CEO Matt Raoul. But with its own ad server in place, Timehop could create a header bidding-like solution on fixed line items. Instead of one line item at a fixed price point, it could set, say, 100 different line items at 25-cent intervals. Each line item would then call the same impressions, and Timehop could cherry pick the ones with the highest CPMs. Its not pure RTB, but it allows Timehop to avoid the waterfall. Essentially, were checking in on every possible price point available so we dont get the short end of the stick, Leviev said. If something is sold for a certain amount, thats the amount the buyer is actually willing to pay. These days, Timehop is profitable, commanding $28 CPMs. It's in the process of prettying up the Nimbus UI and its reporting capabilities so that other publishers can take advantage of the tech. Its also developing an SDK of its own for apps that dont want to build a video player, which should be ready to go by the first quarter of 2019. Leviev said Timehop has a queue of publishers in the pipeline looking to cut out the middleman and take Nimbus for a spin. Theyre willing to try this, because theyre tired of the bigger names, he said. Theyre tired of just DFP. But now Timehop faces a new challenge: convincing demand partners that its got the supply scale and the technical chops to pull off managing its own server-side solution. They dont want to deal with custom implementations, they dont have trust in publishers to implement to spec and they think were small, Webb said. But we do have the technical chops. In recent months, Nimbus has actually been helping Timehop have better relationships with the buy side. Weve gained enough traction where some demand sources are actually asking us for best practices, said Marc Santiago, Timehops director of programmatic engineering and owner of Nimbus the chinchilla. Although Timehop acts like a publisher people consume content within its app and it supports itself with advertising its always really functioned more like a platform company, Webb said. Other apps have writers and editors and we have engineers who spend their time updating our connections to public APIs, Webb said, and that gives Timehop a unique perspective into the in-app world that other content publishers monetizing primarily through desktop and the mobile web dont have. The message were trying to convey to the industry is simple, Webb said. SDKs shouldnt be the one and only way to implement multiple demand sources. Server-to-server can be very efficient.","Two years ago, the Timehop app – which aggregates and resurfaces old social media photos – was running on the remaining fumes of its VC cash, enough to stay afloat for just three months.

Conor Hale,"Nimbus Therapeutics has reined in $65 million in new capital to fund its virtual drug discovery and development pipeline and expand into new targets in immunology, oncology and metabolic diseases. Each of the company’s previous investors participated in the funding round, including Atlas Venture, SR One, Lilly Ventures, Pfizer Venture Investments, Lightstone Ventures and Schrödinger, as well as Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who had provided Nimbus with part of its initial seed funding in 2011. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Nimbus uses an in silico and computational chemistry platform to build novel small molecules, and boasts discovery partnerships with several big pharma and biotech companies, including Celgene, Gilead, Genentech, Charles River Laboratories and Proteros, as well as Massachusetts General Hospital and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

RELATED: Kapeller leaves Nimbus, ending CSO stint defined by virtual drug discovery successes In April 2016, Nimbus’ acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor program was bought by Gilead in a potential $1.2 billion deal. With a $400 million upfront payment, the Big Pharma acquired NDI-010976, being explored in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, with the possible future as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma and other diseases. A few months later, Gilead shelled out a $200 million milestone payment—amounting to half the deal’s total value—after the drug posted positive phase 1 study results in NASH. Since renamed GS-0976, Gilead later released preliminary proof-of-concept data showing the drug blocked new fat deposits in the liver by 29% over 12 weeks. RELATED: Gilead says first data on Nimbus NASH candidate are positive Currently, the company’s main programs in tyrosine kinase 2 and the stimulation of interferon genes, or STING, focus on the biological mechanisms that link immunology, oncology and metabolic disease. Tyk2 signals key pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors, including IL-23, IL-12 and interferons α and β, and is a key target for the treatment of several auto-immune disorders, including lupus, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and others. RELATED: Nimbus in full-on drug development partnership with Charles River STING agonists, meanwhile, play a role in anti-tumor immunity, inducing a Type-I interferon response which can help recruit T cells to attack tumor cells, either alone or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and cell therapies, the company said. STING antagonists may also have therapeutic potential, in diseases such as lupus, where STING drives an exaggerated interferon response. Both programs are in the discovery or preclinical stages. The work on Tyk2 and STING antagonists are headed up under an immunology alliance with Celgene, while the STING agonist program is wholly owned by Nimbus.","Nimbus Therapeutics has reined in $65 million in new capital to fund its virtual drug discovery and development pipeline and expand into new targets in immunology, oncology and metabolic diseases.",2018-06-04T19:19:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fiercebiotech.com'}",In silico drug developer Nimbus collects $65M in new funding round,https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/silico-drug-developer-nimbus-collects-65m-new-funding-round?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=rss,https://qtxasset.com/fiercebiotech/1528139878/artificial-intelligence-3382507_1920.jpg?trpU7PrgUPUU66L8kLwPw_GiLhccRszF,,Fiercebiotech.com,nimbus,1

Derek Thompson,"Good tech gone bad! Nefarious nerds! Dubious online platforms! Predatory late-capitalism! Imagine if every tech and business motif from the past 12 months gathered to celebrate an end-of-year reunion in a single story. This is that story. It is the story of the Fingerlings and the Grinch bots. We begin, as Christmas stories sometimes do, in a toy store. Every holiday season has its must-have gizmo, like Cabbage Patch Kids or Tickle Me Elmo. This year’s sensation is the Fingerling, a plastic five-inch-tall baby monkey. Engineered to cling to an outstretched finger with its plastic hands and feet, the toy giggles, burps, and farts in response to petting and shaking. Imagine a manic pygmy marmoset robot with minor gastrointestinal issues, and you get the picture. Many years ago, in the days when malls ruled the world, adoring mothers and fathers fearing the wrath of a wanting child would storm into stores and shove each other across aisles to grab a toy like the Fingerling. These days, however, the battle royale over popular toys has shifted online, where the dangers are more exotic than a mother’s flying elbow. The new holiday showdown pits humans against software. It’s not a fair fight. A fleet of bots—software programs that can automate activities like search, chat, and online ordering— have been dispatched by anonymous online scalpers to buy up the most popular children’s toys on the Internet. IThese bots overwhelm retail sites with bulk orders from multiple IP addresses and autofill payment and address information faster than humanly possible. Hence, the apt nickname: Grinch bots. Fingerlings are currently sold out at the websites of Toys ‘R’ Us, Walmart, and Target. Where did the toys go? To sites like Amazon and eBay, where the bots’ owners are listing the $15 playthings for $1,000, or more. (It’s not clear who these people are, but they evidently possess programming chops, yet no soul.) Cyber scalpers have used the same methods to deplete online retailers of other toys, like Barbie Hello Dreamhouse and L.O.L. Surprise! Doll, which they can resell at exorbitant prices. While offline toy scalpers and online ticket scalpers are an old trend, this seems to be the first case of mass-scale online toy scalping. Retailers have failed to block the bots, and platforms have refused to stop the sellers. For example, eBay has claimed that there's little it can do to halt the legal exchange of toys. ""As an open marketplace, eBay is a global indicator of trends in which supply and demand dictate the pricing of items,"" the company said in a statement. ""As long as the item is legal to sell and complies with our policies, it can be sold on eBay."" The Grinch bots are not technically stealing or defrauding. They are practicing a form of legally sanctioned ransom. The yuletide fleecing of middle-class parents has attracted political attention. “Grinch bots cannot be allowed to steal Christmas, or dollars, from the wallets of New Yorkers,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said. He has proposed legislation that bans bots on retail sites, expanding a law that already prohibits the use of bulk-buying tickets for concerts or theater. That law’s name is the Better Online Ticket Sales Act—or the BOTS Act. But even if fines make scalpers fear, the law won’t pass before this year. As Grinch bots reap and hoard playthings, ‘twill be too late for Fingerlings. * * * Why is this story so fitting for 2017? The Grinch bot drama mashes together two moral panics about once-celebrated tech stories—platforms and automation—and sprinkles them with dread about predatory capitalism. Beyond the nimbus of presidential scandal and the watershed revelations of sexual harassment, these fears have dominated the tech and business news cycles this year. 1. The Dark Side of Platforms A platform is a digital interface that offers consumers access to a wide range of products, which the platform itself doesn’t necessarily own. Think Netflix for video, or Google for information. In a widely shared 2015 essay, Tom Goodwin, a writer and marketing strategist, summarized the spectacle of platforms tech this way: Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most popular media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world’s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate. Something interesting is happening. He was right: Something interesting is happening. But while Goodwin’s summary inspired sunny optimism back in 2015, the last 12 months have revealed the dark side of platforms, which often serve as clearinghouses of human indecency. Propaganda has thrived on Twitter, Google search results have elevated false breaking news stories, and Uber devised a controversial program called “greyball” to maneuver cars away from regulators trying to bust illegal ride-hailing. Most dramatically, a former executive at Facebook now claims the company is “ripping apart” society. These scandals have not always damaged these companies’ utility or profit; while Uber’s valuation has declined, Facebook and Google’s stocks have grown dramatically. But they have pierced the prevailing techno-optimism by calling attention, again and again, to the same question: How can users trust platforms that are often no better than the worst of their users? That query has special resonance for families who are victims of today’s cyber scalpers. These high-tech scoundrels have scammed online retailers and turned the laissez faire rules of eBay’s platform against the interests of its shoppers. Like the Russian propagandists on Facebook and Twitter, the cyber scalpers succeeded, not by flouting their platforms rules, but by mastering them. 2. The Dark Side of Automation Bots and artificial intelligence have been hailed as the next great technological breakthrough. They populate a vision of a future where corporate bots replace customer-service agents and where personal AI assistants help people shop or manage household tasks, like Her, or, less creepily, Jarvis. In this future, bots serve as automators of tedium and toil, allowing companies and individuals to focus on what really matters to them. But in the last 12 months, bots have been mastered by trolls and scam artists. They have automated the worst elements of human nature—the instinct to deceive, ridicule, and extort. Immediately after the first presidential debate last year, more than a third of pro-Trump tweets (and about a fifth of pro-Clinton tweets) came from bots. Facebook and Twitter were flooded with bots that, in mimicking the most obnoxious users, merely amplified the sites’ worst tendencies. These “bot-makers see an opportunity to exploit anonymity with a humanlike touch at an inhuman scale,” John Herrman wrote for the New York Times. It is a perfect description for the Grinch bot programmers, as well. Scalping is an ancient practice. But cyber scalping allows these scammers to operate at an inhumanly vast scale and with inhuman speed, so that they can absorb the entire supply of popular toys at Walmart and Target’s websites. 3. The predation of “late capitalism.” Merriam-Webster's word of the year is feminism —a worthy selection. But in economic circles, perhaps no term has been more emblematic of 2017 than the ubiquitous yet amorphous “late capitalism.” The concept sounds vaguely Marxist. But it wasn’t coined by Karl Marx himself, according to William Clare Roberts, a political scientist at McGill University interviewed by The Atlantic's Annie Lowrey. Rather, he said, the term came from Marxist acolytes alluding to the darkness that comes just before the dawn of socialism, the moment when ""we see the ligaments of the international system that socialists will be able to seize and use.” It’s hard to imagine a better advertisement for switching economic systems that anonymous scalpers ripping off well-intentioned parents in the name of free markets. But that’s essentially the attitude of the Grinch bot coders and their ilk. Last year, two brothers bought a stockpile of Hatchimals—the it-toy of 2016—to force families to pay large markups to get the toy. It was like an analog version of the Grinch bot scandal. Interviewed by Time magazine, the brothers were remorseless; in fact, they were proud. “We didn’t break any laws,” one brother, Mike Zappa, said. “And we aren’t dictating how the market is pricing the toys on eBay. What we are doing is capitalism at its best.” It’s a shameless defense. But it’s not so different from the argument lurking in eBay’s corporate statement, which implies Grinch bots aren’t a scandal, because their behavior is technically legal. Indeed, that makes a fine summary for the worst storylines of the year, from politics to tech to business. Sometimes, the scandal is what’s permissible.",It’s a Christmas tale for our time: Cyber nerds using high-tech software to buy a slew of baby-monkey robots and holding them ransom for thousands of dollars.,2017-12-14T12:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Why Grinch Bots Are the Most 2017 Story of 2017,https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/grinch-bots-christmas-toys/548354/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/12/RTX16IPH/facebook.jpg?1513200782,,Theatlantic.com,nimbus,1
PETE WELLS,"On the first undeniably cold night in November, an idea began to take shape in my head. The shape was specific, and it looked like the map of Austria. As in my grade-school geography books, it was illustrated with images of natural resources: amber waves of Wiener schnitzel, nuggets of goulash the color of iron ore, the gentle white slopes of Salzburger nockerl. There is no wrong time of year to eat Austrian food, but the approach of winter always brings it to my mind — a lifelong habit of associating strudel and schnitzel with snowflakes that stay on your nose and eyelashes, thank you very much, Julie Andrews. So when I first saw that map, I knew what it meant: Time to go back to Wallsé. For 17 years, Kurt Gutenbrunner has been serving Austrian cuisine underpinned by farmers’ market produce at Wallsé, in the West Village. It was his first restaurant as chef and owner, the start of a minor Austrian empire that now includes Blaue Gans, where there are more wursts on the menu and more elbows on the tables, and Caf é Sabarsky in the Neue Galerie museum, where people sit upright over cups of milchkaffee and slim wedges of Linzer torte. Wallsé is still his base camp, where at the end of the night you might see him towering over the second-tallest person at the bar. Imposing as he is, Mr. Gutenbrunner is dwarfed by his own portrait, which hangs across from the bar. Julian Schnabel painted him looking both heroic and angry, surrounded by a lightning-blue nimbus. The blue light may represent the bolts of inspiration that drive Mr. Gutenbrunner to higher and higher creative peaks, although to me it looked as if he had been soaked with kirsch and flambéed. The painting is one of many that have accumulated at Wallsé over the years. Otherwise, the two small rooms look much as I remembered them from my last visit, around the time of its last review in The New York Times, in 2004, when Amanda Hesser gave it two stars. The windows on West 11th Street are still impressively wide; the tablecloths are still white; the chairs are still black, high-backed and convincingly Secession-ish.

To keep the whole capsule from being stolen, it can be bolted down from the inside, to surfaces such as concrete pads or wooden decks. It can reportedly accommodate almost any type of bicycle, along with some gear. Bikes with handlebars a bit wider than 558 mm (23 inches) will need to have their front wheel turned at an angle in order to fit in, while ones with particularly wide bars will need to have their front wheel removed so that the bars/fork can be turned completely sideways. The unit weighs about 130 lb (59 kg), and measures 79 inches long (2,017 mm) by 53 inches high (1,334 mm) by 32 inches wide (813 mm). If you're interested in getting one, it can be preordered now for US$899, plus $200 shipping within the US. Delivery is estimated for September.

EndPlay,"MOSCOW (AP) - Russian news reports say the hatch of a cargo plane carrying precious metals accidentally flew open upon takeoff - scattering at least 3 tons of gold on the runway. An investigation is underway after the incident Thursday at the airport in the far east city of Yakutsk, according to the Tass news agency. An An-12 plane operated by the airline Nimbus took off for Krasnoyarsk carrying 9.3 tons of gold and other precious metals, according to a statement from the state Investigative Committee quoted by Tass. Damage to a door handle caused it to fly open and spill some of the metal. Authorities recovered 172 gold bars weighing 3.4 tons, Tass quoted Interior Ministry officials as saying. No one was hurt in the incident. Images circulating on social media showed gold bars scattered across a runway. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Steven Bucci,"As major storms and potential terrorism have made America aware of the vulnerability and critical nature of our electric infrastructure (think Puerto Rico post-Hurricane Maria), new ideas are needed to better protect this essential part of our overall critical infrastructure systems and to repair it more quickly when it does get hit. Awhile back, I wrote about a technology that could detect incoming lightning strikes with enough warning time to get exposed people to safety. The Nimbus technology detects very low frequency magnetic signals that are generated by thunderstorms, hurricanes, and other severe weather. In its basic form, the Nimbus 4D handheld detector could allow attendees of outside public events (ballgames, camps, concerts, etc.) to be moved to shelter before anyone was hurt. Applied in different forms and to larger scales, the Nimbus technology could enhance our ability to detect and provide critical warning about thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes. The same base technology also could be modified to “see” small drones approaching facilities with possible hostile intent, with enough time to take counter measures. All this remains on the cutting edge, but many experts contacted me (and Entropy Technology Design, the designers of Nimbus) and said, “Great stuff, but it is still a ‘nice-to-have’ tech capability.” But memorably heavy storms in recent years may enable this technology to make the leap to the status of a necessity. The devastation wrought by big storms is always a tragedy, but in some cases it is catastrophic. A regular thunderstorm can knock out dozens to hundreds of neighborhood electrical transformers. Bigger storms (hurricanes, tornadoes, squall lines) can take that number into the thousands. The island of Puerto Rico lost nearly everything. What if the good guys could “read” the storms before they hit and were able to power down the transformers (and other electric transmission infrastructure) in the likely target area? What if they could do it seconds before the storm hits and causes an electronic surge or flips their fuses? The transformers then could be turned back on without problem as soon as the storm passes. And what about the transformers that do get hit and damaged? You can use the same technology to locate the specific transformers that need physical repair versus mere reset. A huge portion of the recovery time after a major storm is spent in going from transformer to transformer to see which are broken and which just need their fuses flipped. This may sound like wishful thinking, but it actually is achievable today and Entropy also is focused on this. Infrastructure mapping has become a critical part of the development of the Internet of Things—the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with software, sensors, and connectivity that enables them to connect and exchange data—and the goal of smart cities. Smart cities seek to use the Internet of Things to provide a detailed, real-time data web that can be used by the city infrastructure to make critical decisions quickly, safely, and seamlessly. The same logic that will allow your refrigerator to tell you to buy milk as you drive by the grocery store can be used to take important city equipment off-line before it’s damaged by a thunderstorm. In both examples, the data is real and delivered exactly where it’s needed in time to make a quality-of-life decision. But cities can’t become truly smart until the very real threat from dangerous weather is made a part of the moment-to-moment database used to make decisions. The Nimbus technology represents one way to add this important weather data into the planning and reaction capability of a smart city. Because the Nimbus was designed to be small and portable, it’s easily mounted on commercially available drones of the sort that are owned and operated by lots of folks today. That new concept can be used in several ways that feed on each other to provide a comprehensive system. The first step is to “map” the electric transmission infrastructure, in particular the unique “fingerprint” of the radiated magnetic field produced by the different parts of the system (major transmission line towers, normal power poles, and neighborhood transformers). There are an enormous number of miles of these systems, but by using multiple low-cost drones, this can be done fairly quickly. Once this map of “normal” is obtained, you have a baseline heartbeat of the city, town, or infrastructure that tells what the system looks like when in normal operation. As a storm approaches, operators use the Nimbus Base Station (provides more range and thus warning) in its original mode to determine the storm’s likely specific target area and use this information to preemptively shut down key elements seconds before the hit, and to restart it as the storm passes. This alone would limit the damage to a point far below the norm for a major event. You don’t need to shut down an entire system for hours, or lose it for weeks when you truly can limit the shutdown to seconds (perfect for critical systems) and keep the damage to a minimum. The final piece is sending out the same drone fleet after the storm to find the specific transformers or towers that no longer “match” the baseline. This pinpoints which should be prioritized for repair, which will allow it to be accomplished with fewer repair assets and eliminate the need for checking every individual device in the effected area. This is a classic example of the out-of-the-box thinking we need today. By using a linked technology in different manners to accomplish multiple tasks, you save money, space, and training. Can any community or power provider afford to not invest in this kind of capability? Nimbus may have been a cool, added safety device before, but this wider application is absolutely needed today. No one could have foreseen how brittle the critical infrastructure of Puerto Rico had become. Hurricane Maria simply destroyed it. The American people have stated clearly they think the recovery operation is too slow, despite the Herculean efforts being made. We must do better as a society, and the goals and visions of the Internet of Things and smart cities as a driver can help us accomplish this. Today there is a choice. Deployment of technologies such as Nimbus can map our infrastructure systems, identify a storm’s target, guide mitigating actions to minimize damage (and downtime), and finally triage the recovery effort. Every step gets citizens back up and on the grid faster and more effectively. All together, this means less suffering and less cost. The investment is small compared to the savings. Why are we waiting?","As major storms and potential terrorism have made America aware of the vulnerability and critical nature of our electric infrastructure (think Puerto Rico post-Hurricane Maria),...

Ben Branch,"Reading time: about 3 minutes. This was Steve McQueen’s Nimbus Model C motorcycle – an unusual and quite advanced bike from Denmark characterized by its inline-4 cylinder engine with a single overhead cam and the remarkable distinction of being the first motorcycle in history to be fitted with telescopic front forks. The Nimbus Model C The Nimbus Model C is one of the most distinctive motorbikes of its age, exuding art deco styling with its gleaming fenders, a shapely color-coded frame, a low slung seat and swept back handlebars. Though the styling was world-class the real secret to the success of the Nimbus was its engine. It was designed in 1932 by company co-founder Peder Fisker and his son Anders, their goal was to develop a motorcycle engine that would power the company’s next model, and it had to be as extensible, reliable, and advanced as possible. Nimbus was already famous for inline-4 cylinder motorcycles, their first model was fitted with a slightly more primitive example, though it built up a good reputation for reliability and ease of use over its 1919 to 1926 production run. The Nimbus Model C was developed from a blank slate, with an all-new inline-4 cylinder engine that featured hemispherical combustion chambers, an overhead cam, a displacement of 746cc, an integral crankcase and cylinder block of cast iron with a detachable alloy sump, and a shaft drive to the rear wheel. Interestingly the Nimbus would be the first motorcycle in the world to use a telescopic front fork, appearing less than a year before the BMW R12, though in fairness the BMW forks also had hydraulic damping. Rather than use expensive steel tubing, the Fiskers developed a frame using 40mm x 8mm steel flat bar using rivets to join them. The fuel tank sits between the top frame rails above the engine and as was common at the time, there’s no rear suspension just sprung saddles. Upon its release in 1934 the Nimbus Model C quickly became the best selling motorcycle in Denmark, it was a homegrown hero loved by the general public, as well as the local police forces, military, and postal service. So popular was the Model C that it would stay in production until 1959 when the final batch of military motorcycles were delivered. In all over 12,000 were produced, a significant figure for the time, and today there are still over 4,000 of them road registered in Denmark with many more around the world. Steve McQueen’s Nimbus Model C Motorcycle Shown Here The Nimbus you see here is one of the most special examples of the Model C in the world – it’s the one that belonged to Hollywood icon and motorcycle racing legend Steve McQueen. It’s not known when McQueen bought his Nimbus but his love of motorcycles was well-known, particularly vintage motorcycles from the 1920s and 1930s. What we do know is that once he bought this Nimbus he never parted with it, and it was still in his collection in 1984 when it was auctioned off after his untimely passing. It’s now being offered for sale with its original patina intact, though it was refreshed over the years great pains were taken not to remove the character the bike had built up over the years with its illustrious former keeper. The Nimbus Model C was commonly fitted with a sidecar as its 18 – 22 hp 750cc engine was far more capable than most, making it ideal for powering the additional weight. McQueen owned a number of motorcycles with sidecars attached and he obviously had a soft spot for them.

Nick Paul,"Rosana Kapeller, M.D., Ph.D., has left Nimbus Therapeutics after eight years in the CSO post. Kapeller departs having helped put virtual drug discovery on the map and land deals with Celgene, Genentech and Gilead. Resigning as CSO of Nimbus frees Kapeller up to “explore an executive leadership role,” suggesting she will reappear at another biotech sooner rather than later. Kapeller’s decision to explore the new role leaves Nimbus to search for a replacement for a CSO who helped to define and manage its novel approach to early-stage research. The new CSO will inherit an R&amp;D organization that took an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor program to a $400 million-plus takeout by Gilead, has partnerships with Celgene and Genentech in oncology and autoimmunity and is cooking up wholly-owned discovery-stage assets. That pipeline is one piece of Kapeller’s legacy. The other piece relates to how Nimbus generated and advanced its assets. Under Kapeller, Nimbus helped to show virtual drug discovery is a viable model for biotechs, something that wasn’t certain when it set out on a heavily-outsourced path in 2009. The initial task of making the virtual model work largely fell on Kapeller and then-Nimbus CBO Jonathan Montagu. Bruce Booth, whose roles as a partner at Nimbus-founder Atlas Venture and early chairman of the biotech gave him a good view of the process, was effusive about Kapeller’s work. “Recruiting [Kapeller] to Project Troubled Water (later known as Nimbus) in February 2010, when we were only 9 months old, was one of the smartest hires I've ever made,” Bruce Booth, a partner at Nimbus-founder Atlas Venture and early chairman of the biotech, wrote in a post on Twitter. Nimbus established its network of service providers, including computational drug discovery leader and company cofounder Schrödinger, in a very different funding environment than exists today. But the existence of younger biotechs that eschew internal capacity is testament to its continued relevance.","Rosana Kapeller, M.D., Ph.D., has left Nimbus Therapeutics after eight years in the CSO post.

It is reported to have been previously owned by a New York-based real estate investment company, with whom it spent much of its life underground in a 5th Ave parking garage. It was acquired by the selling dealer earlier this year, who had it serviced by an independent Jaguar Specialist approximately 100 miles ago. Power comes from a fuel-injected 3.6-liter inline-six paired to a 4-speed automatic gearbox, and as a Sovereign it came standard with ABS, self-leveling suspension, headlamp washers, stainless trim, and more. This XJ6 is now being offered at no reserve in Orlando, Florida with Carfax and Autocheck reports, and a clear New York title. The Nimbus White finish features a body length pinstripe, as well as polished side mirrors, bumpers tops, and window surrounds. Older Pirelli tires are fitted on the factory alloy wheels and the brake system was serviced last month. The Sovereign’s interior received inlaid burl walnut as well as a 6-speaker stereo. Cruise control and the onboard computer can be selected to the right of the steering column, and the front power seat controls are visible on either side of the center console. The A/C system was recharged in July 2018. 3,200 miles are shown on the digital odometer. The AJ-series 3.6-liter inline-six features 4-valves per cylinder and fuel injection. Factory-rated output when new was 201 hp and a 4-speed ZF automatic gearbox is responsible for delivering power to the independent rear axle.

John Voorhees,"Feral Interactive has brought Codemasters’ GRID Autosport to iOS, and it’s gorgeous. Codemasters is no stranger to racing games. The developer’s F1 2016 game was featured during Apple’s iPhone 7 keynote in 2016 and set a new standard for racing games on iOS when it debuted in November that year. Just over one year later, GRID Autosport is pushing those boundaries again. Everything about this game is big starting with the download. GRID is 4 GB, but there’s almost 2 GB more of additional free content available as two In-App Purchases. It’s an unusual approach for a paid-up-front game that costs $9.99, but presumably, the In-App Purchases are designed to reduce the size of the initial download. GRID requires horsepower too: iOS 11 and later, plus an iPhone SE, 7 or newer, any iPad Pro, or a standard 2017 iPad. The combination of storage space and hardware needed to run GRID limits its potential audience, but those who have the gear to play it are in for a treat. GRID, which is a popular PC and console racing game, brings the depth and detail of those platforms to iOS. Few PC and console games shine on iOS, but the relatively simple controls of racing games make them an exception. With GRID, players steer by tilting their iPhone or iPad, brake by tapping the left side of the screen and accelerate by tapping the right side of the screen. If you prefer an onscreen wheel for steering or a gamepad, those and several other tweaks can be made in the game’s settings. The simple controls don’t mean, however, that GRID is an easy game by any stretch of the imagination. Even in Rookie mode, which controls the brakes automatically, it took me a while to get the hang of the game’s tilt steering. Graduating to a higher difficulty level takes time, but you won’t get bored or have to play the same tracks over and over as you learn the ropes because there’s what seems like a bottomless pit of tracks and cars to try. In fact, there are 100 cars and 100 tracks. There are also several game modes including Career, Custom Cup, Time Trial, and Quick Race modes and within each of those modes, several options. For example, Quick Race features Race, Time Attack, Endurance, Eliminator, Checkpoint, Demolition Derby (one of my favorites), and Drift events. GRID will give your iOS devices a workout too. While I played on my iPhone X, it got noticeably warm, and the batteries of it and my 12.9-inch original iPad Pro drained quickly. This isn’t a game you’re going to want to start at the end of the day on 20% or less battery. It also took up to 20 seconds for levels to load, which is quick by most console standards, but noticeable on an iOS game. Of the two devices I played on, I give the iPhone X the edge. The textures and colors of GRID come to life on the iPhone X’s display in a way that my original iPad Pro can’t match. GRID also uses haptic feedback to add another layer to the experience. In contrast, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro is too heavy and cumbersome to use with tilt steering enabled. I quickly switched to my Steelseries Nimbus Bluetooth controller, which was a much nicer, more console-like experience. Still, the combination of the iPhone X’s screen and haptics make it my preferred platform for GRID. I have only just scratched the surface of GRID, but have been impressed by it. The detail of the cars and environments is unusual for a mobile app. Although it’s an expensive game by current App Store standards, there are many, many hours of fun packed into GRID Autosport, which make that price well worth it for fans of racing games. GRID Autosport is available on the App Store.","Feral Interactive has brought Codemasters’ GRID Autosport to iOS, and it’s gorgeous. Codemasters is no stranger to racing games.

"Leif Johnson, Leif Johnson","Game controllers have been a part of the extended iPhone experience for years, but Apples older certification requirements kept them from fully mimicking the same experience you get from an Xbox One controller or Sony DualShock 4. Even with the best ones, theres usually a catch. Sometimes you need to mash the buttons before they register. In other cases the latency is awful (particularly when the controllers run on Bluetooth). Worst of all, you usually cant press down on either of the controllers thumbsticks, which effectively makes some games all but unplayable.
Thats why Im so happy to see the Rotor Riot Game Controller. Its the first MFi (Made for iPhone) controller that takes advantage of Apples looser restrictions that dropped with iOS 12. It has a handful of its own drawbacks, but it doesnt fall into any of the traps mentioned above, and its new support for the thumbstick buttons makes it particularly well-suited PS4 Remote Play at a time when it's a fairly hot item on iOS. Considering gamings outsized presence on the App Store, Im just a little surprised that a company thats best known for making drone parts was the first one to pull it off.
Dopplegamer
The Rotor Riot even gets the look and feel right. Toss it in a box with your other controllers, and youll likely accidentally pick it up when you mean to reach for your Xbox One controller. The thumbsticks are in the oddly satisfying staggered position you find on the Xbox controller as opposed to the side-by-side design of the Sony DualShock 4. It feels a little light when it's on its own compared to controllers that have batteries, but it feels just right when youre holding it with the phone attached in its case.
[ Further reading: Everything you need to know about iOS 12 ]
Leif JohnsonI'd worried I wouldn't like the disc-style D-pad as much as the cross on the SteelSeries Nimbus, but it usually did what I wanted.
Indeed, you dont even need to charge it as a 25-inch Lightning cable extends from the controller so it can plug directly into your iPhone, thereby giving you better latency than youll get with a controller that connects through Bluetooth. (Of course, this also means you can't charge the iPhone while you're playing a battery-battering game like Fortnite.) The cord is long enough that you can also hook it up to an iPad other than the UBC-C equipped 2018 iPad Pros, but I wouldnt really recommend it. In heated moments, Id be afraid itd cause me to accidentally yank the entire tablet off the table and shatter my self-esteem, my display, and possibly my bank account all at once.
The optional plastic phone holder keeps that from happening with your iPhone. I say optional, but its silly to play without it as it keeps your phone anchored to a convenient spot. Its extendable clamp is just big enough that it can hold my iPhone XS Max while its still in its silicone case, although Im a little bummed that I cant adjust the slightly steep angle. Im also bummed that the phone holder adds an extra step when I want to use it on the road. The entire controller takes up a lot of room when I slip it in my bag with the holder still attached, so every time I go somewhere I find myself unscrewing it so I can pack the pieces separately. Im almost certain this will lead me to lose the phone holder one day.
Leif JohnsonSee what I mean?
Worth the wait
Those concerns melt away once you see the Rotor Riot controller in action (and youll see that action soon, as it asks for permission to pair the very second you plug it in). Unlike some other controllers, every button here does exactly what I want toand when I want it to. As far as iOS games go, this is true enough for everything from minimalist artsy adventures like Altos Odyssey (which really only uses one button) to complex, frantic multiplayer shooters like Fortnite. It boasts a familiar placement of buttons, and most importantly, it lets you press down on either of the two thumbsticks so you can use them as two additional buttons. These are typically known as true L3 and R3 buttons on console game controllers like the Sony DualShock 4, and no other MFi controllers currently support them because of Apples weirdly restrictive old certification rules. Even Fortnite, unfortunately, doesn't support them yetalthough I'm hoping that Epic Games can fix that in an upcoming patch. 
Leif JohnsonYou cant adjust the angle, but fortunately it feels perfect for playing games in bed.
For that matter, the Rotor Riot controller itself didnt actually support the L3 and R3 buttons at launch, but that changed with a recent update. Theres a good chance youll have to install that update yourself, but fortunately its not hard; the update process begins the very second you first plug the Rotor Riot into your iPhone. First it asks for permission to pair. Then it asks for permission to download the affiliated Ludu Mapp app that lists compatible games. After that the Ludu Mapp app asks for permission to download the firmware.
And thats it. Boom. You dont even need to restart the phone. After that, you can play God of War on the PlayStation 4 through PS4 Remote Play better than than any other MFi controller at the moment. The secret sauce is all in those thumbsticks. Press the left one, and God of Wars protagonist Kratos starts sprinting. Press on the right, and the mad Spartan locks on to an enemy.
It sounds so simpleso necessarybut other MFi controllers were forced to scrap this functionality for years. In fact, if you watch me trying to play God of War with Remote Play with the Gamevice in a recent how-to video, you can see Kratos flailing about at a lethargic pace because the Gamevice cant let me use two of the most important buttons in the game. Theres no way I would play the entire game like that.
Leif JohnsonIn case I wasnt clear, being able to use this without taking off my case is a really big deal.
Mind you, the Rotor Riot controller doesnt provide corresponding buttons for every button on a DualShock 4, but fortunately the Remote Play app itself makes up for that. Along the bottom of the apps display, youll see a digital bar that delivers access to the Options, Share, and PlayStation buttons and Ive rarely felt a pressing need to have them on the controller with this setup. The one exception would be the Options button, but fortunately the big central button on the Rotor Riot automatically remaps to that.
Short of playing with a DualShock 4which is impossible on an iPhone, if youre wonderingits as close to a seamless experience as youre going to get.
Bottom line
Not every game currently supports the L3 and R3 buttons on the Rotor Riot controllerincluding Fortnitebut the design of the gamepad is such that functionality could be unlocked with a patch. Right now, though, it's the only MFi controller that supports them. With PS4 Remote Play, it lets me play everything from God of War to Persona 5 as easily as I might play it on an actual PlayStation 4 (so long as my internet is up to the task). Until its competitors catch up, this is the controller Ill be reaching for.

Sanjay Patel,"JWTs could be very useful in RESTful Web Services — not only for stateless authentication, but for all the purposes that require tokens — e.g. email verification and forgot-password. In this post, we'll discuss why and how to use the Nimbus JOSE + JWT library for creating and parsing JWT (JWE) tokens. For code examples, we’ll refer to Spring Lemon. If you haven’t heard of Spring Lemon, you should give it a look. It’s a library encapsulating the sophisticated non-functional code and configuration that’s needed when developing real-world RESTful web services using the Spring framework and Spring Boot. JWT in a Nutshell There’s already a lot of material available on JWT. So, instead of repeating those here, let's just summarize it as plainly as possible. A JWT is a URL-safe token with some data embedded in it. The data would be signed/encrypted, so that malicious guys can’t alter it (or create another token with altered data). There are two kinds of JWTs — JWS and JWE. JWS tokens will have their data signed but not encrypted. That means that the data can be parsed by anyone. For example, these can be used as authentication tokens where the front-end or any client needs to read the data. JWE tokens instead will have the data encrypted so that no one (except the creator or someone having the secret key) can parse it. Why Nimbus JWT Java has two popular open source libraries for JWT creation and parsing: JJWT and Nimbus JOSE + JWT. Between these, JJWT is simple and easy to use. In fact, most articles on the Internet that dicuss how to use JWT with Spring use the JJWT library. So, why bother using the Nimbus JWT? For a couple of reasons. First, Nimbus JWT is comprehensive. It has many useful features that are not found in JJWT. For example, it supports creating JWEs, which are essential for creating tokens to be sent through mail (e.g. forgot-password tokens). Secondy, Spring Security 5 itself uses Nimbus JWT — its dependencies like spring-security-oauth2-client and spring-security-oauth2-jose include nimbus-jose-jwt. So, when using Spring Security 5, it’s natural to prefer Nimbus JWT instead of any other library. How to Use Nimbus JWT Nimbus JWT supports multiple algorithms for signing and encrypting tokens. In this post, we’ll discuss creating/parsing JWE tokens using a shared key, which would fit into most use cases when developing stateless REST Web Services — e.g. authorization, email validation, forgot-password etc. So, let’s see how to use it. I’ll be pasting in some code snippets as examples, but for a detailed reference, you can refer to the JwtService class of Spring Lemon. Creating a Token A JWT will have multiple parts. One of those is the payload, which contains the actual data to carry. Creating the Payload Each piece of the data in the payload is called a claim. For example, if you’d like to pass an email and a name, first build a ClaimsSet with two claims: JWTClaimsSet claims = new JWTClaimsSet.Builder().claim(""email"", ""sanjay@example.com"").claim(""name"", ""Sanjay Patel"").build(); Tip : You can use the standard JWT claims — such as subject, audience or expiration time — when possible. In fact, Nimbus classes, such as the builder above, have special methods supporting those. See the JwtService class of Spring Lemon for examples. Ok, then create the payload as below: Payload payload = new Payload(claims.toJSONObject()); Creating the Header Another part of a JWT would be the header, which contains the encryption algorithm and method. Here is how you could create one: JWEHeader header = new JWEHeader(JWEAlgorithm.DIR, EncryptionMethod.A128CBC_HS256); The above says that we are going to use direct encryption with A128CBC_HS256 algorithm. So, the next step is to create an encrypter for it. Creating the Encrypter The encrypter can be created as below: String secretKey = “841D8A6C80CBA4FCAD32D5367C18C53B”; byte[] secretKey = secret.getBytes(); encrypter = new DirectEncrypter(secretKey); The secretKey above is an aes-128-cbc key, generated using an online utility. Note that the encrypter above could be a global one; you don’t need to create an encrypter per token. Creating the Token Now that you have the header, payload, and an encrypter, the next steps would be create a JWE object, encrypt it, and then serialize it to produce the desired token: JWEObject jweObject = new JWEObject(header, payload); jweObject.encrypt(encrypter); String token = jweObject.serialize(); So, your token is ready. Give it to whoever wants it! Parsing a Token Let’s now see how to parse a token. For that, we’d first need to configure a JWT Processor. Configuring a JWT Processor Configuring our JWT Processor can be done as below: ConfigurableJWTProcessor&lt;SimpleSecurityContext&gt; jwtProcessor = new DefaultJWTProcessor&lt;SimpleSecurityContext&gt;(); JWKSource&lt;SimpleSecurityContext&gt; jweKeySource = new ImmutableSecret&lt;SimpleSecurityContext&gt;(secretKey); JWEKeySelector&lt;SimpleSecurityContext&gt; jweKeySelector = new JWEDecryptionKeySelector&lt;SimpleSecurityContext&gt;(JWEAlgorithm.DIR, EncryptionMethod.A128CBC_HS256, jweKeySource); jwtProcessor.setJWEKeySelector(jweKeySelector); The secretKey above must be the same one that we used earlier. Parsing the Claims The above jwtProcessor can then be used to parse the claims out of our tokens, which is shown below: JWTClaimsSet claims = jwtProcessor.process(token, null); String email = (String) claims.getClaim(“email”); String name = (String) claims.getClaim(“name”); Conclusion So, this is a way we can use Nimbus JWTs in our applications. It does look a little harder than JJWT, but this is non-functional stuff that you only need to code once to receive its benefits all the time. (You, of course, would need to maintain it as new versions of Nimbus JWT comes out, but that's where a higher level library like Spring Lemon would take your burden off.)","JWTs could be very useful in RESTful Web Services — not only for stateless authentication, but for all the purposes that require tokens — e.g. email verification and forgot-password.

Logan Booker,"Just a few years ago, we were losing our minds over Samsung's 16TB solid state drive. Now, in 2018, you can get 50TB and 100TB SSDs, as long as you're willing to pay enterprise prices for them, of course. Still, that doesn't take away from the fact that, while flash hasn't beaten magnetic on cost yet, it's well and truly punching hard in the space department. The California, US-based Nimbus Data, which specialises in fat storage of the solid-state kind, revealed the chunky 100TB ExaDrive DC100 earlier this week. Unsurprisingly, it's a 3.5-inch form factor drive, with Nimbus boasting performance in the range of 100,000 IPOS (input/output operations per second) and a throughput of 500MB/s. The drive's 100TB density is thanks to 3D NAND, which allows flash manufacturers to cut layers into the silicon and stack memory cells on top of each other. We're all generating data faster than storage providers can keep up, and that problem is only going to get worse. On Friday, Western Digital announced a potential game changer that promises to expand the limits of traditional HDDs to up to 40TBs using a microwave-based write head, and the company says it will be available to the public in 2019. Read more So, how much can you pack into 100TB? I'll let Nimbus Data explain, using an entirely new unit of measurement, known as the ""iPhone"": Using 3D NAND, the DC100 provides enough flash capacity to store 20 million songs, 20,000 HD movies, or 2,000 iPhones worth of data in a device small enough to fit in your back pocket. For data centers, a single rack of DC100 SSDs can achieve over 100 petabytes of raw capacity. If you're kooky enough to want one of these and you're not Google or Apple, too bad: Nimbus hasn't released any pricing info. But expect it to cost tens of thousands of dollars, easily.

Jack Lenox,"Over the past six months, I've become increasingly interested in the topic of web sustainability. The carbon footprint of the Internet was not something I used to give much thought to, which is surprising considering my interest in environmental issues and the fact that my profession is web-based. The web in a warming world As a brief recap, I attended MozFest in London last year. In between sessions, I was scanning a noticeboard to see what was coming up, and I spotted a session entitled, ""Building a Planet-Friendly Web."" I felt a little dumbstruck. What on Earth was this going to be about? I attended the session and the scales fell from my eyes. In what now seems obvious — but at the time was a revelation — I learned of the colossal energy demand of the Internet. This demand makes it the largest coal-fired machine on Earth, meaning that its CO₂ emissions are probably at least equivalent to global air travel. More and more people are coming online, but this, coupled with the rise of ever more obese websites, means that the Internet's energy demands are growing exponentially. Every additional byte transferred means more energy, which in most countries means more CO₂. It is widely accepted that we should avoid printing emails to save trees, but this leads to a false assumption that the web is a green medium. I'm afraid to say, it is not. Is there another way? The good news is, it needn't be this way. Since 2009, Greenpeace has been auditing Internet companies on their energy usage, and lobbying them to improve by way of their Clicking Clean campaign. The Green Web Foundation has an ever-growing database of hosting companies who use renewable energy, or who are at least committed to being carbon neutral. And new tools are emerging to help those working on the web measure the environmental impact of our products. There are also some great resources out there such as Tim Frick's Designing for Sustainability, three year's worth of talks from the SustainableUX conference, and peripheral material that, while not explicitly focused on sustainability, can help us build lower carbon websites. Enter Susty WP I decided to challenge myself to see how efficiently I could package a WordPress website. While I was at it, I thought, “Why not make the website about sustainability and WordPress?"" I know, WordPress/sustainability inception. Cool, huh? And so, sustywp.com is born. With its accompanying theme, Susty. I'm rather chuffed to say I managed to get the load of the homepage down to 7KB of data transfer. I did actually get it down to 6KB, but the meta stuff added by Yoast bumped it up almost a whole KB! 😛 However, given I'm trying to spread a message, I deemed this to be an acceptable trade-off. Before I get into the nuts and bolts, I just want to share a few headline facts: So, how does it work? The remarkable thing about this is actually how mundane it is. Heavily inspired by Heydon Pickering's evangelizing about writing less damn code, and projects like Brad Frost's Death to Bullshit, I embarked on a root and branch pruning of Underscores, removing everything I possibly could. And to be clear, it's not as though Underscores is full of cruft. It's a very lean starting point for building a theme. I'm a great admirer of it and thoroughly endorse using it. However, it includes certain assumptions that didn't chime with my spartan goal of making the smallest possible WordPress site. Such as, you ask? Nav? No. Sidebar? Get rid of it. Classes? Not in my socialist utopia. Given the constraints I had set, anything making it to the DOM had to have a very good reason to be there. With this being an experiment, I took the somewhat radical approach of relegating the navigation to its own page. This is wonderfully liberating and means I didn't have to go through the almost always disappointing dance of wondering how I would make it look presentable, hide it for the many users who won't care, make sure it's robust enough to be infinitely long with never-ending dropdowns, etc. This means less HTML, less CSS, and definitely no JavaScript! Win, win, win. As for the sidebar? Well I've always had an aversion to sidebars, so that was an easy thing to remove. Susty has no widget area. I'm sure it'll get over it. Is there more fat we can trim? Well, if we're going to have hardly any HTML, and we want minimal CSS, do we really need all those classes? I wanted to try my hand at writing CSS in the way it was intended to be used, instead of bowing to the class-ititis and div-ititis that pervade the industry. You might not need web fonts Alongside images, video and JavaScript, the other item that has become a significant factor in bloated websites is web fonts. Given that it's now a Silicon Valley fashion for every startup to commission its own typeface as a first order of business, it seems as though every website you visit incurs downloading a bunch of font files. It may not seem so bad to tack on a hundred kilobytes for some nice type, but when you multiply this by the many different people visiting your website across different devices and browsers, fonts can easily account for hundreds of megabytes of data transfer — if not gigabytes/terabytes/petabytes for higher traffic websites. Custom web fonts are also a potential antipattern for our users, for whom: Page loads are slowed down as they see either a flash of unstyled text or, potentially even worse, no text while the font loads. By the time the font has loaded, they don't notice or care. If you do have to use custom fonts or are in combat with the flash of un-styled text, font-display is an new property designed to instruct the browser how to handle font downloads. This post goes into it even more. Almost every device these days has a half-decent set of fonts installed, so why not compose a stack of potential fonts you'd like to see, ending with either “serif “ or “sans-serif."" Or embrace those default fonts altogether with a system font stack. I wanted Susty to have a bit of a Swiss Style aesthetic, so my font stack ranges from the perfectly proportioned Helvetica (which all Apple devices have by default) to sans-serif, by way of Arial, Frutiger and Nimbus Sans L. As an Ubuntu user, I see Arial, which is perfectly pleasant. On my Android devices I see the default sans-serif font (Droid Sans I believe), which actually works rather well on mobile — you'd almost think that's what it was designed for! What else? Standard stuff. Few or no images and SVG where possible Beyond this, it's really just the standard. The homepage of sustywp.com has no images and just one SVG which is loaded inline rather than by an HTTP request. The CSS is minified. Everything gets Gzipped. The server is tuned with NGINX and Fast-CGI cache to serve content from memory. Bonus SPA-like features without the work or code When I was boring my girlfriend, Daisy, with my plans, I asked her how she felt conceptually about a website not having a navigation, and it instead being on its own page, found via a ""menu"" button. She thought it sounded ok. So, when I came to show it to her, I watched eagerly as she clicked the menu link. Her response was that she didn't really think about clicking to see the menu, and the menu appearing, as changing pages. This confirmed one of my fears that my previous obsession with eliminating page loads when building Single Page Apps (SPAs) is something that only really bothers web developer-y types. Most people don't really notice it or think about it. So, if you make your website lightning fast, the page loads themselves are almost imperceptible anyway. With that being the case, I figured why not just pretend it was a menu overlay? So, I added a cross dismiss button and a tiny bit of JavaScript to take you from the menu back to the previous page if you click it. (I did initially implement this in PHP using the $_SERVER superglobal and HTTP_REFERER, but this breaks when using something like FastCGI cache to serve pages (i.e. those pages there is no $_SERVER superglobal.) There’s still more to come We all know that things can always be better. Here are a few of the things I’m working on to improve Susty: Finish reading Jeremy Keith's book Going Offline so I can implement a Service Worker and make Susty even more performant. Look to see how I can implement Gutenberg. It's going to add a bunch of kilobytes and that makes me sad! 😉 Currently, sustywp.com is hosted in one data center in London, and served globally from that location. This means that someone in Wellington, New Zealand is not going to get the full experience! I have a longer-term plan of establishing my own little CDN of edge servers (each one hosted by a 100% renewable energy powered host in each location that I can find one) just running NGINX and serving cached versions of the site. This is a simplified way of how we do things on WordPress.com VIP. In conclusion Susty is an example of taking sustainable design techniques to an extreme. I'm not suggesting that we should all start building websites with this exact method. But I do think sustainability should be a much higher priority in the web design industry. It's good to think about saving any kilobytes we can, and to think in terms of kilobytes rather than megabytes. If you do want to use a JavaScript interface library, why not try out Choo.js, which has React-like features and comes in at just 4KB. Remember, NASA managed to put a man on the moon with about 50KB of data storage at their disposal. The best thing about all this is that efficient websites means faster websites, which means: Happier users Better search engine placement Happier servers","Over the past six months, I've become increasingly interested in the topic of web sustainability.

Matt Posky,"Cadillac recently made the choice to suspend its vehicle subscription service, claiming the operation hit some costly roadblocks. That’s been our beef with most subscription programs as well, only on the consumer side of the coin. Customers typically end up paying significantly more for access to a fleet of vehicles that, individually, would have been much cheaper to simply buy or lease. Still, the intended draw isn’t saving money, it’s convenience â most subscription services allow customers to swap between select models on the fly, baking in both insurance and maintenance fees. While these subscription services have been limited to premium nameplates thus far, Toyota wants to try its hand and see how things play out for a mainstream manufacturer. On the surface, this seems like a sound strategy â Toyota boats a far more varied lineup than brands like Cadillac, BMW, Porsche, and Volvo. Imagine a scenario where you’re motoring around in an 86 and feel the need to move some lumber. Just deep-six the 86 for a Tundra pickup. Maybe the next few months involve taking the kids to soccer practice, necessitating something like aÂ Sienna minivan. In theory, Toyota’s new “Kinto” program would allow you to do that. Named after the magical flying nimbus cloud that appears in a popular anime franchise Â (and presumably has some significance within the broader Japanese culture), Kinto ( kintounÂ ç­æé²) is said to function in much the same way by appearingÂ “when necessary and enables mobility as per the user’s wishes.” If the Japanese flare hasn’t already tipped you off, this pilot program is launching in Toyota’s home country â specifically in and around theÂ Tokyo area. However, the automaker has plans to expand the service if the initial foray turns out to be successful. “Cars have been loved by people for over 100 years since they were first developed for many reasons in addition to their convenience,” explained Toyota bossÂ Akio Toyoda. “Indeed, I believe that it is because they offer many joys to people, including the joy of ownership, the joy of driving, and the joy of mobility. As society shifts from owning cars to using cars, the Kinto beloved car subscription service is a new proposal to enable customers to more freely enjoy cars. The service makes it easy to start life with a car as soon as the customer feels that they want one. Moreover, if the customer wants to try another car, they can change cars, and if they no longer need the car, they can return it.” In addition to saying it’s striving to transform itself into a “mobility companyÂ that offers a range of services related to mobility in light of the mobility society of the future,” Toyota also repeatedly referred to Kinto as a “beloved car subscription service.” The oddly Japanese phrasing is not without purpose. Toyota claims it’s working on a way to reward drivers whoÂ “carefully use the car as if it were their own beloved vehicle.” The details on that are yet to be finalized, though the company says it would issue points forÂ safe or ecological driving utilizing connected technology and regular visits to dealership. While an interesting idea, it also sets a rather creepy precedent for corporatized monitoring that we hope never extends to purchasable automobiles. The program is said to launch at the start of 2019. [Image: Toyota]","Cadillac recently made the choice to suspend its vehicle subscription service, claiming the operation hit some costly roadblocks.

Perez Hilton,"There is no denying there has been a diversity problem in the Harry Potter franchise.

Meg Lappe,"Under Armour’s newest foam, named HOVR, released at the end of January (right around Outdoor Retailer ) and debuted in new two running shoes: the Sonic and the Phantom. The Phantom represents the higher-end of Under Armour’s line, and the Sonic occupies the space just below that. To get a feel for how the new foam technology compares to other options on the market, like Adidas’s Ultraboost and Nike’s new Epic React foam, I ran in the Sonic for just over 20 miles. But beyond new foam, the Sonic brings connectivity to the table through a built-in sensor. The Good: There’s no break-in period with the Sonics. The dual-layered breathable upper hugs the arch of your foot, and the new foam provides an ample bounce that works great on long runs. They’re responsive and lightweight, even with an external heel cup for support. The shoes connect easily to the MapMyRun app which allows users to easily track miles, pace, stride length and cadence. Who They’re For: The HOVR Sonics are great for runners who want a bit more support in the heel cup and underfoot, but still want ample space for toe splay. The toe box is larger and more flexible than New Balance Zantes or even the Adidas All Terrain Ultraboost. Watch Out For: While the microthread fabric is quick drying, breathable and dual-layered around the midfoot, it might not contain the level of support you need if you’re particular about feeling compression around your arch. The flat-knit upper consists of a sock liner that’s more rigid than it appears. Since the tongue is uber stretchy, I had concerns that I might slide around in the shoes, especially around turns, but that was a non-issue. Alternatives: The Sonic felt similar to Saucony’s Liberty ISO, and the Asics Gel Nimbus-20, only lighter. The foam itself feels similar to the Nike Pegasus 34, without as much roll in the foot.","The Under Armour HOVR introduces a new type of foam to help improve comfort on your long runs.

David Nield,"For a number of years now, Lenovo-owned Motorola has specialized in mid-range Android smartphones that combine decent specs and design with affordable prices. With the Moto G6, Moto G6 Play, and Moto G6 Plus, unveiled today at a special event in Brazil, that tradition continues. Following on from the G5 and G5S series of handsets we saw last year, the three phones offer three different price points and levels of power for the discerning smartphone buyer. All come with elongated 18:9 aspect ratio screens. The vanilla Moto G6, sitting in the middle of the line-up, comes with a 5.7-inch, 2,160 x 1,080 pixel display. Inside you get a Snapdragon 450 chipset, 3 GB or 4 GB of RAM, and 32 GB or 64 GB of storage. The battery is pegged at 3,000 mAh, and deep indigo, black, blush, and silver are your choice of colors. The budget Moto G6 Play, available in deep indigo and silver, has the same 5.7-inch screen but a lower 1,440 x 720 pixel resolution, and a slower Snapdragon 427 chipset. That's matched with 2 GB or 3 GB or RAM, 16 GB or 32 GB of storage, and a 4,000 mAh battery. One other feature unique to the G6 Play is that the fingerprint scanner is on the back rather than below the screen. It also uses a microUSB connector and charger rather than the USB-C on the other two phones. Finally up at the top end is the Moto G6 Plus: it boasts a larger 5.9-inch screen, with a resolution of 2,160 x 1,080 pixels. It's the fastest of these three phones, coming with a Snapdragon 630 chipset and 3 GB, 4 GB, or 6 GB of RAM, as well as either 32 GB or 64 GB of on-board storage. The battery size is 3,200 mAh, and deep indigo and nimbus are the colors here. The higher-end Moto G6 and Moto G6 Plus feature a dual-sensor, 12 MP and 5 MP camera setup around the back, while the Moto G6 Play sticks with a single 13 MP snapper. All three phones have microSD slots, if you want to expand how much room you've got for your movies, photos, and other files, and keep the 3.5 mm headphone jack. Android 8.0 Oreo is on board. Now none of those specs are going to trouble the best phones of 2018, but they fit the bill for users wanting an Android phone with respectable performance at a price that won't break the bank – and they don't look bad either. For something even more affordable, Motorola also announced the Moto E5 and the Moto E5 Plus, another few rungs down on the smartphone ladder in terms of specs and price. That said, the E5 Plus can last a whole two days, according to Motorola, thanks to its 5,000 mAh battery. As for pricing and availability, the Moto G6 will set you back US$249, while the Moto G6 Play will go for $199 – it's in this pricing that Motorola is really hoping to stand out, and that's a lot less than the super-powered flagships of 2018 will cost you. The other phones are launching in Europe first, with US availability to be announced. The Moto G6 Plus will cost €299 (roughly $370 with a straight conversion), the E5 will set you back €149 ($185), and the E5 Plus is going to cost €169 ($210). All of these handsets should be going on sale in the near future, but exact dates have yet to be confirmed.

Sean T. Collins,"Godless has two major factors in its favor: the sun and the stars. The former glares into the mud-caked eyes of Sheriff Bill McNue (Scoot McNairy), a lawman who’s secretly going blind, then shines down on a field where he collects flowers to place on his late wife’s grave with a brightness that echoes his still-warm sentiments. (“I can see just fine,” he announces as he picks primroses and whatnot, to no one in particular except perhaps the sunlight itself.) It burns like the fire of fate itself when bandit-turned-babyface Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell) exits the barn where he’s recuperating from gunshot wounds and sees the silhouetted form of Alice Fletcher (Michelle Dockery), the outcast widow who shot and then saved him. It creates an ironic, halo-like nimbus around the head of Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels), the one-armed madman robbing and slaughtering his way through the mining towns of 1884 Colorado in search of loot and his one-time apprentice Roy, when he rides his horse right into a rural church and promises he’ll rain the wrath of God Himself on the parishioners should they ever lend his rogue ally their aid. It’s reduced to a dim, dun haze by the dust swirling around the site of Dillon’s latest massacre, dust from which mustachioed Marshall John Cooke (Sam Waterston) emerges to gaze in penitent horror at Frank’s grim handiwork. Finally, it reflects off the water that splashes and sprays from beneath the hooves of the horses ridden by Dillon and his gang as they cross a river in slow motion, dazzling and luminous and, it seems, imbued with the sheer joy of filmmaking within a beloved genre. By now you’ve probably picked up on the “stars” side of the equation. The series premiere of writer-director-creator Scott Frank’s Godless, “An Incident at Creede” (referring to the aforementioned massacre), parades its cast of familiar and friendly faces before the camera in all their well-worn Western finery like a herd of prize cattle. One of the big under-covered pleasures of the past few years of Peak TV is getting to see its stars re-mixed and re-mingled once they’re freed from the commitments of shows that launched and ended earlier in the era. Want to watch Halt and Catch Fire ’s Gordon Clark confess his love to Downton Abbey ’s Lady Mary Crawley? I know I do! Want to see Sam Waterston play Old West Batman to Jeff Daniels’s horse-opera Joker, like the weirdest reboot of The Newsroom imaginable? Now’s your chance! Years of totally omnipresent TV culture have turned its actors into one giant repertory company where we viewers are concerned; it’s often delightful, as it is here, to sit down and see what this season’s production will give them to do, even if you’re not nuts about the end result. In Godless ’s case there’s not much to disappoint you just yet. The show falls very, very, very squarely within the confines of its genre; it’s an old-school oater the new-school aspect of which, namely nasty (and sometimes sexual) violence, hasn’t actually been new at least since The Wild Bunch rode into town nearly fifty years ago. Thus, while it’s hard for the show to knock your socks off, it’s equally difficult for it to shit the bed. Soup-strainer facial hair, stern-faced gunslingers filmed against big sky, metaphorically biblical imagery and literally Biblical dialogue: If you like this kind of thing, this is the kind of thing you like. And that’s exactly the experienced the algorithmed-out-the-wazoo metrics by which Netflix judges its programming are designed to deliver. The episode’s best moments come when it leans into the Western’s larger-than-life qualities as hard as it can. Why have one widow when you can have La Belle, a whole mining-accident-devastated town full of them? Why have a sharpshooter demonstrate his prowess by killing a human target when he can shoot a snake, and the snake is threatening a baby, and the shot doesn’t just kill the critter but takes its hissing head clean off? Why have him simply be good with horses when he can gentle an entire corral to the point of every animal lying down like lambs? No good reason that I can see, frankly. As to innovation, my personal favorite wrinkle in the usual fabric of these things is Truckee (Samuel Marty), the son of Alice and her late, and likely murdered, Native American husband. From the moment Alice takes Roy in, not yet knowing who he is or what he’s done, her son provides a constant, gently sardonic running commentary in his very low-key voice, as if a character from a Peanuts special had suddenly wandered on set. Moving forward, the test for Godless, clearly a labor of love for Frank and his collaborator Steven Soderbergh, will be whether they can add flourishes of character, plot, and tone, like Truckee or that gorgeous slo-mo river run, turning the merely solid into something magical. Stray observations From the Bible-quoting to the civlian-slaughtering to the horse-in-church bit, Frank Dillon’s villainy is laid on mortar-thick. Some of these bits and pieces works better than others. Losing a limb to the man he’s hunting, a la Ahab and his white whale? Sure, that’ll do. Confidently asserting he knows how and when he will (and won’t) die, like Jojen Reed in Game of Thrones (played by Thomas Brodie-Sangster, also in the cast)? Pass. As a dyed-in-the-wool original-recipe Law &amp; Order fan I didn’t realize how badly I needed to see Jack McCoy ride out of the dust on horseback until I was staring him in the face. It’s fun to hear how actors with voices as distinct as Sam Waterston’s and Michelle Dockery’s arrive at their individual Western accents. Waterston’s adds twang to his signature warble; Dockery slow-cooks her posh pronunciation until it’s just this side of Southern. Native Texan Scoot McNairy is basically fine as-is. &lt;Paul Rudd in the Tim &amp; Eric “Celery Man” sketch voice&gt; Nude. Scoot. I’d held out hope for months that the show would use the Dandy Warhols’ “Godless,” from their pretty much perfect record Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia, as its theme song. I may just mute the credits, put this on iTunes as they roll, and pretend.","Godless has two major factors in its favor: the sun and the stars.
