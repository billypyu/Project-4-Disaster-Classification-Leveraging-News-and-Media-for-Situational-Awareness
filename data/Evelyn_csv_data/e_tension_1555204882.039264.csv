Rhett Allain,"Occasionally there are physics lab demonstrations that I think are pretty awesome but that my students just think are ""meh."" This is one of those cases. The basic idea in this demo, which I used in my class at Southeastern Louisiana University, is to swing a mass around in a horizontal circle. But wait! There's a cooler part: By running the string through a vertical tube and attaching it to another mass, we can control the tension in the string. It's loads of fun. What am I talking about? Maybe this will help. Yes. That is me. I have a confused look on my face because I have to concentrate to keep the swinging length constant. Maybe this is why the students dislike this lab. Oh well. There are a few important features of this swinging mass. Let me draw a diagram. If you want to swing the mass around with a lower angular velocity, the string will need to be longer. If you want a shorter string, the mass will have to spin around faster. This is the only way to make it work since the tension in the string is constant. Why is the tension constant? Consider the mass hanging down at the bottom of the tube (I have labeled this M 2 ). Since this mass is just hanging there (and not spinning in a circle) then it is in equilibrium with an acceleration of zero meters per second squared. Since the acceleration (in the y-direction) is zero, then the net force must be zero Newtons. There are only two forces in the vertical direction, the downward gravitational force with a magnitude of M 2 g (where g = 9.8 N/kg) and the upward tension (T). That means the tension has to have a value of M 2 g—no matter how you are swinging the other mass. What about that angle that the string makes as the mass moves around in a circle (labeled as θ above)? How does this angle change as you swing at different speeds? Let me start with a force diagram for mass m 1. Although this mass is moving in a circle, it's just a horizontal circle. There is no motion and no acceleration in the vertical direction. This means the net force in the y-direction must be zero. Looking at the tension, the component of tension in the y-direction depends on the magnitude of the tension (which I already know) and the angle (which I don't). I can write this as the following equation. Using the value of the magnitude of the tension (from before), I get the following expression for θ. That's it—θ. It doesn't even depend on how fast you swing the mass or the string length. That sort of seems crazy, but it's true. Since the tension in the string is constant and the vertical component of the tension force must be constant, the angle must also be constant. Let me just check with a quick measurement. Here are two swings with the same masses, but different lengths. From this, it seems I get 30.4° and 22.8°. That's not exactly the same—not quite sure why there is such a difference. One problem might be that I am not exactly swinging it in a horizontal circle. Maybe I will have to do a bit more exploration here. OK, there is one more thing to look at. What about the relationship between the angular velocity and the length of the string? Looking at the force diagram above, there is only a component of the tension force acting in the horizontal direction. This means the net horizontal force can't be zero. In fact, it has to be equal to the mass (m 1 ) multiplied by the acceleration. In this case, the mass is accelerating to the right since it is moving in a circle. The circular acceleration would be the product of the angular velocity squared (we like to use the symbol ω for this) and the radius of the circle. Notice that the radius of the circle is not the length of the string—instead it is the length of the string multiplied by the cosine of θ (to get that adjacent side of the triangle). Putting this together, I get the following. This equation says that the square of the angular velocity should be proportional to one divided by the length of the string. That seems simple enough to test. All I need to do is to swing the mass around with different length strings (the length from the top of the tube to the mass). I can do this by watching a small piece of tape at the bottom of the tube to make sure the length is constant. Of course I need to also keep the masses constant. I can determine the angular velocity by measuring the time it takes the mass to make one rotation. The angular velocity will then bey 2π divided by this time. I did this for five different lengths using a hanging mass of 50 grams and a swinging mass of 15.8 grams. Here is a plot of ω squared vs. 1/L: That looks fairly linear. But the important part is the slope. Looking back at the relationship between ω 2 and 1/L, the proportionality constant should be M 2 g/m 1. I know the masses and I know g, so this constant should be 31 m/s 2. The linear fit has a slope of 43 m/s 2 —so not quite the same, but still close. Still, if this was a student lab report, I think that data would be acceptable. I'm still slightly concerned that the swinging angle isn't constant and this slope isn't closer to the expected value. I have a feeling that there might be some friction between the string and the rotating glass rod. Friction at the contact point would mean that the tension in the string at the swinging mass is not M 2 g, but something else. Maybe I need to come up with a different method to measure the tension. Honestly, this is a great reason why you should always work through the lab experiments—even if you are pretty sure you know how stuff works. You just never know how things will turn out.","With a specific setup, you can control the tension in the string.",2018-05-09T13:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",The Physics of Swinging a Mass on a String for Fun,https://www.wired.com/story/the-physics-of-swinging-a-mass-on-a-string-for-fun/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5af238d714823b60460cfe32/191:100/pass/MassOnString-149868420.jpg,wired,Wired,tension,1
Tasha Robinson,"Welcome to Cheat Sheet, our brief breakdown-style reviews of festival films, VR previews, and other special event releases. This review comes from the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. For the past several years, theater owners have been visibly struggling to find gimmicks to keep film lovers from abandoning movie theaters in favor of their own audiovisual setups at home. The rise of 3D and 4D films, the movement toward luxury seating and gourmet food in theaters, the push toward higher technical standards — they’re all aimed at increasing the value of the moviegoing experience. But theater owners could opt for a much lower-tech solution: just program a lot more horror movies like Ari Aster’s terrifying feature debut, Hereditary. More than any other genre, horror movies benefit from the collective viewing experience, the sensation of feeling an entire room full of people gasping in fear, screaming in shock, or giggling out of nervous tension. Hereditary picked up a reputation early on at Sundance 2018 as an exceptionally scary horror film, and it’s a particularly terrific experience in a packed theater. Aster’s story about a haunted family and a mysterious legacy is packed with jump-scares, but it also builds up the kind of slow-burn, nearly unbearable tension that can leave an entire theater holding their collective breath. What’s the genre? Horror. More specifically, a kind of seeping-dread horror familiar from the heyday of William Friedkin and Roman Polanski. There’s a fair bit of The Exorcist and Rosemary’s Baby in Hereditary, which draws on Satanic Panic ideas without directly evoking them, and draws out the story with a 1970s-style slow build. What’s it about? Artist Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is in a minor state of shock after the death of her 78-year-old mother Ellen. Above all, she’s shocked at how little grief she feels. In a disturbingly candid eulogy, she mentions how Ellen dominated her life, how Ellen shut out her own family with her “secret rituals and secret friends,” and especially how Ellen took an unsettling interest in Annie’s daughter Charlie, even insisting on personally breastfeeding her. That deeply strange detail is never explained, but like so many things about Hereditary, it hints to the audience that something deeply unnatural is going on. It’s even creepier that the Graham family is so deeply immersed in the unnatural that they don’t even notice it anymore. Annie and her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne), teenage son Peter (Alex Wolff), and daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) move into Ellen’s stately former home, where they encounter a lead-up series of minor scares and eerie apparitions. Ellen seems to be haunting Charlie, a grim and off-kilter child who shows little emotion, apart from resentment and calculation. She tends to ignore what’s going on around her, in favor of making unpleasant little toys and sketching disturbing drawings. She doesn’t seem particularly disturbed when her dead grandmother keeps turning up. Meanwhile, Annie is preoccupied with the elaborate miniature rooms and tableaus she builds, Steve is busy with work, and Peter is focused on his crush on a classmate. This leaves Charlie free to cut the head off a dead pigeon and make a doll out of it, which also goes unremarked. For a while, Hereditary looks like it’s headed in a scary but familiar direction as Ellen’s spirit seems bent on claiming Charlie, who seems pretty amenable to the idea. Then the film takes a radical left turn, and stretches out in increasingly shocking, unpredictable, and gory ways. The characters disintegrate under the various pressures they’re facing, and the building tension stems from the question of whether the family will be destroyed by some kind of greedy spirit, or just tear each other apart under the strain. Aster piles on the personal confrontations and emotional breakdowns, but compounds them with unnerving new hauntings, all the way up to an ending that feels foreordained, but still shattering. What’s it really about? A lot of things. Maybe too many things at once. The most obvious one is extreme grief and how people process it, how they turn inward and shut down, or externalize it and find someone to blame. But it’s also about the sacrifices people are willing to make for power, the urge to express even the most unacceptable feelings through art, and the question of culpability in a preventable but still accidental catastrophe. Per Aster himself, at a post-screening Q&amp;A, it’s at least partially about his need to process the series of disasters that hit his own family, and the way they navigated the feeling of being cursed. And of course, it’s about scaring the hair off the audience. Is it good? The downside to Hereditary is that it feels cluttered, both thematically and narratively. There are a lot of subplots at work here. In one, Annie has a major upcoming museum show, but she’s been unable to produce the necessary work, so she’s dodging their calls and slipping into depression. Another involves her sleepwalking habit, and a hair-raising story about trying to kill herself and her children in her sleep. When the hauntings get serious, the Graham family faces a wide array of phenomena that don’t seem clearly connected, from spooky dancing lights to a door that won’t stay closed to a book with unexplained magical powers. The supernatural doesn’t seem to follow any kind of rules in Hereditary, which actually undermines the tension : when literally anything might happen, it’s harder to fear one specific thing happening. That said, Hereditary is a hell of an intense ride, made for a crowd that enjoys heart-clutching adrenaline spikes. The cast is unerringly terrific, particularly Shapiro (a Tony winner at age 10, for Matilda: The Musical ) and The Leftovers ’ Ann Dowd, who has a ridiculous, awesome five films at Sundance this year. Wolff ( My Friend Dahmer ) does a fine job with a demanding part, but the film’s most important asset is Collette, who weeps, screams, and snarls her way halfway off the screen and into the audience’s laps. Annie is a complicated character, sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes outright repulsive. The role only works because of Collette’s power to sell her emotions to an audience that may want to distance itself from her visible agony. Watching her suffer is emotionally exhausting because she plays the character with such intensity. And Aster directs the film with a scrupulous focus on intensity. Over and over, he returns to close-ups of his characters’ faces as they take in some grotesque offscreen horror that strains the limits of their sanity. He never makes these shots short and efficient: they’re drawn out like studies in the facial mechanics of fear. Aster returns to the same tricks over and over — those oh-my-God-look-at-that-thing-the-audience-can’t-see-yet shots, characters waking up from sleep to some ghastly thing in their rooms, a certain sound effect that some jerks who see this film are destined to troll their friends with for months afterward. (Although effective, the repetition does eventually begin to drag.) But Aster’s script really cares about this family unit. Many horror films treat their characters like disposable murder-fodder, but perhaps since Aster was inspired by his own family, he puts a lot of work into building the connections between the characters. He’s invested not just in their survival, but their emotional health, and their connections with each other. Which makes it all the more tragic as Hereditary threatens these things in turn, cruelly and effectively. It’s a merciless film, crafted for maximum effect. See it with an emotional support group, or at least with a theater full of people who are all likely to end up on the same wavelength. What should it be rated? This is an unquestionable R, for everything from full-frontal nudity to buckets of blood. How can I actually watch it? A release date is still TBD, but the distribution rights are with A24, which also released Lady Bird, The Disaster Artist, A Ghost Story, and It Comes At Night, among others. Expect a wide 2018 theatrical release with plenty of lead-up hype, showcasing all the people at Sundance who walked out of this film with shaky knees and gaping mouths, then took to social media to rave about the experience.","Ari Aster’s directorial debut has its faults, but the combination of slow-build tension and intense, merciless shocks is unbeatable",2018-01-23T22:00:48Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Sundance’s breakout horror hit Hereditary is pants-wettingly scary,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16924782/sundance-2018-horror-hit-hereditary-review-toni-collette-ari-aster-gabriel-byrne,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JnCzTbZLfY_qkrXKMH-8D6KIDRE=/0x54:475x303/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10085467/image001.png,the-verge,The Verge,tension,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption A rare event: Patriarch Kirill (C) meets Bartholomew (R) and other Orthodox priests in Istanbul Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko says top clerics in the Orthodox Church are now ready to grant independence to the Kiev Church, defying Moscow. If the Constantinople Patriarch, Bartholomew, grants Kiev autocephaly (independence) he will be recognising its split with the Moscow Patriarchate. On Friday Russia's Patriarch Kirill met Bartholomew in Istanbul. They did not resolve the Kiev Church's status. Russia sees Kiev as the historic cradle of the Russian Orthodox Church. Russian President Vladimir Putin, a staunch ally of Patriarch Kirill, is bitterly opposed to President Poroshenko. There is a tense standoff in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian government troops and Russian-backed rebels. In a tweet on Monday Mr Poroshenko said Bartholomew's Ecumenical Patriarchate had ""decided that, without taking account of Moscow's opinion, it can give all states the right to establish a local church. ""And first of all it is the right for Ukraine to set up a Local Congregation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church."" Image copyright AFP Image caption President Poroshenko (R) is an ally of Metropolitan Filaret (C), head of the Kiev Patriarchate On Facebook a spokesman for the Kiev Patriarchate said the move to grant independence was going ahead. ""The Ecumenical Patriarch explained to the Russian delegation that the decision had been taken and that the relevant procedures were under way,"" Archbishop Yevstratiy Zorya wrote. What is the dispute all about? Tensions within the Ukrainian Orthodox Church mounted after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine won independence, and with communism discredited there was a huge revival in Christian worship. For centuries, before the Soviet period, the Russian Orthodox Church had been identified with the Russian state, allying its interests with those of the tsar. The Russian nationalist revival under Boris Yeltsin, then under Vladimir Putin, boosted the Church's authority and determination to stay in charge of the Ukrainian churches. Read more on related topics: In the early Middle Ages Christianity spread to the rest of Russia from Kievan Rus, which was the origin of the Russian state. Today there are three Orthodox Church branches based in Kiev: the Kiev Patriarchate, headed by Metropolitan Filaret, which does not recognise Moscow's authority the Ukrainian Orthodox Church loyal to the Moscow Patriarchate and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, which broke away from Moscow's control during World War Two. The branch loyal to Kirill remains the biggest, but a formal schism could lead many of its followers to join the Kiev Patriarchate. The Moscow Patriarchate's position is that the Ukrainian ""schismatics"" should repent and return to the Russian Orthodox fold. Image copyright AFP Image caption In July Ukraine celebrated 1,030 years since Kievan Rus converted to Christianity But there is also rivalry between Kirill's powerful Moscow Patriarchate - which has an estimated 150 million followers - and the Ecumenical Patriarchate under Bartholomew, who is seen as first among equals in the Eastern Orthodox Church. The rivalry has been there for centuries, dating back to the Byzantine and Russian empires. Ukraine was part of the Russian empire, but many of its worshippers looked to Constantinople (later Istanbul), rather than Moscow for spiritual guidance. Speaking after his talks in Istanbul, Patriarch Kirill said he and Patriarch Bartholomew had discussed ""all the problems on the agenda"" and it was ""a dialogue between two brothers"". ""There was nothing secret at the meeting, nothing that could sort of explode one's conscience,"" he said, without giving any specifics.

PETER BAKER and ADAM NOSSITER,"By contrast, Mr. Trump during the fall midterm election campaign proudly adopted the nationalist label for himself. Beyond security, the biggest points of contention between the United States and France right now are the renewed American sanctions against Iran and the threats against French companies doing business in Tehran. Both businesspeople and Mr. Macrons officials have expressed outrage over these threats. The French want to continue to do business with Iran and resent being put under pressure by the Americans. Mr. Trump remains hugely unpopular in France and Mr. Macron, after making efforts to cozy up to Mr. Trump, has in the last several months shown signs of distancing himself. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr. Macron argued for cooperation between nations that seemed to be a direct rebuke to Mr. Trumps unilateralism. Mr. Trump is set to spend just about 48 hours on the ground but will have the chance to interact with other world leaders at several events hosted by Mr. Macron, including potentially President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. While long scheduled, the trip gives Mr. Trump the opportunity to try to briefly escape the domestic controversies dominating Washington. Democrats are preparing to take control of the House after midterm elections, and critics are lashing out at the presidents decision to fire his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, seeing it as an effort to impede the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into any ties between Mr. Trumps 2016 campaign and Russia. Later on Saturday, Mr. Trump plans to visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery at the foot of the hill where the Battle of Belleau Wood was fought and attend a dinner hosted by Mr. Macron. On Sunday, he will join about 70 world leaders for a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe commemorating the armistice that ended World War I at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918.

RICHARD FAUSSET,"If elections officials do not hear from them, they are moved to an inactive list, and their registration is canceled if they do not vote or make contact with officials over the next two general elections. Critics say this process could have a disproportionate effect on minority voters, and is fundamentally flawed in other ways. These postcards voters get, they think its more junk they dont have to review, said Julie M. Houck, senior special counsel for the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. A separate controversy erupted this election season over a Georgia law that mandates that the signatures on absentee ballots and absentee ballot applications visually match the signatures kept on file with county elections officials. The American Civil Liberties Union sued Mr. Kemp over the law on the grounds that people were essentially being denied the right to vote because of poor penmanship. Sean J. Young, the legal director for the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that roughly 700 absentee ballot applications, and 189 absentee ballots, had been rejected by county officials because of mismatched signatures. A judge issued a temporary restraining order on Oct. 24 that barred county officials from rejecting the ballots or applications based on perceived signature mismatches. A number of critics of Mr. Kemp have called for him to step down as secretary of state to eliminate any suspicion that he has his thumb on the scales of the election.

ELIZABETH DIAS,"And he recognizes that many members of his congregation will support the president no matter what. When he spoke out from the pulpit against Mr. Trump’s denigrating comments about immigrants early this year, he said, a family left his church. The evangelist Franklin Graham’s California rally last week in Fresno also exposed the underlying racial tension in the evangelical community, the three pastors said. They recalled that when Mr. Graham, the son of the late evangelist Billy Graham, announced his tour, the pastors of more affluent communities in Fresno tended to support his mission of mobilizing evangelical voters. Local African-American evangelical leaders, however, opposed it; they recalled how Mr. Graham had not condemned Mr. Trump’s comments about immigrants and his equivocating response to Charlottesville last year. Mr. Binion, who helped lead Billy Graham’s crusade to Fresno in 2001, called Franklin Graham “a pretender” and objected to his call for a travel ban against Muslims, issued before Mr. Trump’s, and to his hostility to L.G.B.T.Q. people. While Mr. Loera had supported Mr. Graham’s trip to Fresno, pastors like Mr. Binion had been so opposed to it that a representative from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association flew out to meet with them this year in an attempt to address their concerns, the pastors said. After the meeting, Mr. Binion decided to make the information about the crusade available to his church but to not promote it from the pulpit. A spokesman for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said that meeting with local churches in advance was standard practice ahead of such tours. Mr. Willis said that when he showed a promotional video for Mr. Graham’s visit to his congregation, which is largely white, several families walked out, and he worried that Mr. Graham’s trip could fracture the unity the local pastors had been working to build in recent years. “Unity,” Mr. Willis said, “was more important than a Christian celebrity coming to town.”","In a discussion with The New York Times, three pastors in the heavily evangelical Central Valley talked about race, President Trump and double standards.",2018-06-02T20:45:45Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Roseanne Barr Comments Highlight Racial Tension, California Pastors Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/02/us/politics/roseanne-barr-california-pastors-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/02/us/politics/02fresnopastors-1-sub/02fresnopastors-1-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tension,1
Devin Coldewey,"After months of tension and a variety of smaller milestones, the FCC order voiding 2015’s net neutrality rules and instating its own, much weaker ones will finally take effect on June 11, the agency’s chairman Ajit Pai said today. Although the rule was approved in December, entered into the Federal Register in February, and under ordinary circumstances would have taken effect in April, “Restoring Internet Freedom” had one extra step that needed to be taken. The Office of Management and Budget needed to take a look at the rule because it changed how the industry reported information to the government, and under the Paperwork Reduction Act that authority had to approve the final version. That approval was granted on May 2, the FCC explained in a news release, and June 11 was picked as the effective date “to give providers time to comply with the transparency requirement.” The Congressional Review Act paperwork filed yesterday means the Senate will soon be voting on whether the rules can stay in place, but the likelihood of that bill passing the Senate and House and getting signed by the President is pretty much nil. Still, the votes will put proponents and opponents of net neutrality in the open and potentially make it an election issue. Lawsuits alleging various flaws in the process or rule itself may eventually cause it to be rolled back, but that will take months, if not years, and lacking evidence of direct harm judges are unlikely to take the rules out of effect while considering the case. Don’t expect much to happen immediately should the new rule take place; the industry is too savvy to blast out some new, abusive rules under the far more permissive framework established by this FCC. But as before, consumers will often be the first to spot shady behaviors and subtle changes to the wording of marketing or user agreements, so keep your eyes open and tip your friendly neighborhood tech blog if you see something.","After months of tension and a variety of smaller milestones, the FCC order voiding 2015's net neutrality rules and instating its own weaker version will take effect on June 11, the agency's chairman Ajit Pai said today.",2018-05-10T15:59:54Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Net neutrality will officially die on June 11,http://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/net-neutrality-will-officially-die-on-june-11/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dont-tread-on-net2.png?w=711,techcrunch,TechCrunch,tension,1

The Canadian ice dancing competitors, who are so much better than any other pair that even a person who doesn't understand skating (me) can tell they're deity-level, are famous for appearing to be deeply in love on the ice. Let's be real. Is anyone this good at pretending? Finally, there's the pair we can feel a little less weird about, because they definitely love each other: married American pairs skaters Alexa Scimeca-Knierim and Chris Knierim. Scimeca-Knierim battled life-threatening gastrointestinal illness in 2016, leaving her future uncertain — but the two have come back with a vengeance, showing clear and extremely shippable passion on the ice. Plus, they were at the Olympics together on Valentine's Day. It doesn't get more romantic than that. ""I think what a lot of people have a hard time grasping is this journey is really between Chris and I,” Scimeca-Knierim told the Washington Post. “It’s not about our score. It’s not about the other teams being better than us. It’s deeper than that.” Wow!!!!!!!!! Also, can someone pitch a figure skating dramedy to the CW?

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Carles Puigdemont met students and others in Helsinki on Friday Authorities in Finland have received a Spanish request to arrest separatist Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont. The arrest warrant was issued on Friday, a day after his arrival there. The ex-leader has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium since last October's banned referendum that led to Catalonia's unilateral secession bid. Tensions in the region are very high and separatist leaders have abandoned plans to name a new president following the arrest of the latest candidate. Crowds of protesters clashed with police in Catalonia on Friday night after Spain's Supreme Court ruled 25 Catalan leaders should be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state. Convictions could result in up to 30 years in prison. One of those taken into custody was Jordi Turull, who was to be the subject of a vote in the Catalan parliament on Saturday for regional president. Media caption Police clashed with protesters in Barcelona on Friday Other separatist figures were already in custody or had gone into exile abroad. Mr Puigdemont has been in Finland since Thursday. His lawyer, Jaume Alonso Cuevillas, told Catalunya radio on Saturday that Mr Puigdemont would co-operate with the Finnish authorities. His client ""had not fled from Spanish justice"", he said. Friday's rulings at the Supreme Court in Madrid were considered the most serious challenge to date to the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight. Altogether 25 separatists have been charged variously with sedition, rebellion, embezzlement and other crimes. They deny the allegations. The five Catalan politicians remanded in custody on Friday were: Jordi Turull - former Catalan government spokesman and the latest candidate for regional president Josep Rull - former Catalan development minister Carme Forcadell - former Catalan parliament speaker Raul Romeva - former Catalan foreign affairs chief Dolors Bassa - former Catalan labour minister All five spent some time in detention following the banned referendum but were released on bail late last year pending investigations into their individual roles in the vote. Image copyright EPA Image caption Politician Josep Rull said goodbye to family and friends before entering court on Friday In his 70-page ruling, Supreme Court Judge Pablo Llarena said that they should be returned to jail as they represented a flight risk. He did not set a date for their trial. The five join four other Catalan leaders already in prison. They include Oriol Junqueras, the former Catalan vice-president, and Jordi Sánchez, who was nominated to lead the Catalan government but dropped the bid after the Spanish authorities refused to release him to attend an investiture ceremony. Judge Llarena also issued an arrest warrant for Marta Rovira, the deputy head of the separatist Esquerra Republicana party, who failed to appear in court on Friday. It later emerged that she had fled into exile and Spanish media reported that she was in Switzerland. Following the referendum, the central government in Madrid sacked the Catalan regional government, imposed direct rule and called new elections but pro-independence parties returned with a slim majority. In a setback for the pro-independence cause, a survey published by the respected Catalan Centre for Opinion Studies recently suggested support for independence had dropped sharply, with a majority of Catalans now against the idea.",Authorities assess Spain's arrest warrant for Catalan ex-leader Carles Puigdemont amid high tension.,2018-03-24T13:15:35Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Spain Catalonia: Finland ponders request to extradite Puigdemont,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43527492,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9367/production/_100553773_394b7be9-cdf0-4b8b-90aa-3fb71a168269.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tension,1
Jennings Brown,"Today has been exciting for anyone who cares about tension among Big Techs ultra-rich, as two executives have thrown barbs over Facebooks management ethos. The beef heated up this morning when Forbes published an interview with WhatsApp founder Brian Acton. Acton left Facebook a year agothree and a half years after selling WhatsApp to Facebook for $22 billion dollars. Months after his departure, he helped lead the charge to #DeleteFacebook and gave $50 million to the Signal Foundation, which created a competing messaging app, Signal, as well as an encryption protocol used by WhatsApp. In Wednesdays Forbes article, Acton explained why he was so eager to bail on Facebook that he was willing to also bail on $850 million in unvested stock. Acton said the main reason he left was because he disagreed with Facebook executives desire to focus on business analytic tools and targeted ads. And he told Forbes that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks CEO, prioritized monetization over encryption. I sold my users privacy to a larger benefit, Acton told Forbes. I made a choice and a compromise. And I live with that every day. The article came two days after Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger left Facebook a decision reportedly stemming from their clashes with Zuckerberg. While the Instagram executives were more congenial in their parting statements (explaining that they want to explore our curiosity and creativity again) than Acton has been, the attention on Facebooks issues with the now-former executives at both acquired companies has brought a stream of negative attention toward Zuckerbergs leadership. Well, Facebook and Zuckerberg now have a defender in David Marcus, who is leading blockchain endeavors at Facebook after a stint as the head of Facebook Messenger. In Marcus public Facebook post titled The other side of the story, he said he felt compelled to write because of his recollection of events that differ greatly from the reality I witnessed first-hand. Facebook did not respond to a Gizmodo request for comment on either Marcuss or Actons statements. Marcus wrote that Facebook did not ask him to write the post and that it contains his personal views exclusively. Marcus wrote that Zuckerberg granted the WhatsApp founders request for a unique, roomier office layout, even though it irritated people at Facebook. As far as the encryption disagreement, Marcus wrote that Zuckerberg defended strong encryption after WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum convinced Zuckerberg of the importance of it. And Marcus responded to Actons comments on Facebooks approach to the business model for WhatsApp, writing that Zuckerberg protected WhatsApp for a very long period of time and suggested Acton was passive-aggressive in his approach and actively slow-played the execution, and never truly went for it. Then Marcus dug in: Lastly call me old fashioned. But I find attacking the people and company that made you a billionaire, and went to an unprecedented extent to shield and accommodate you for years, low-class. Its actually a whole new standard of low-class. He concluded that Facebook improves billions of lives. Because connecting people is a noble mission, and the bad is far outweighed by the good, he wrote. Despite the discontent and difference of opinions, there are two lives that have benefited greatly from Facebookthose of Marcus and Acton.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption North and South Korea had a warm meeting in the DMZ North and South Korea have agreed to hold military talks to defuse border tension, after their first high-level meeting in two years. The North will also send a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games taking place in South Korea in February. Agreement was also reached to reinstate a military hotline suspended two years ago, the South's government said. However, the North's delegation was negative on the subject of denuclearisation, the South added. What happened at the talks? After a day of negotiations, the two sides issued a joint statement which confirmed they had agreed to hold military talks on defusing military tension. The North also agreed to send a National Olympic Committee delegation, athletes, cheerleaders, art performers, spectators, a taekwondo demonstration team and media to the games, while the South would provide the necessary amenities and facilities. The statement also referred to exchanges in other, unspecified areas and other high-level talks to improve relations, the South's Yonhap news agency reports. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption North Korea first expressed interest in joining the Pyeonchang Games during the New Year The South asked the North to end any hostile acts that might raise tension, while the North agreed there was a need to guarantee a peaceful environment on the peninsula, a statement from the South's government said. Other details had been released throughout the day by officials from the South: The South proposed that athletes from both Koreas march together at the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang as they did at the 2006 Winter Olympics The South pushed for the reunion of family members separated by the Korean War - a highly emotional issue for both countries - to take place during the Lunar New Year holiday, which falls in the middle of the Games The South said it would consider temporarily lifting relevant sanctions, in co-ordination with the UN, to facilitate the North's participation in the Olympics The North's reaction to these proposals is not known. In his opening remarks, the head of the North Korean delegation, Ri Son-gwon, was fairly neutral. He said he hoped the talks would bring a ""good gift"" for the new year and that the North had a ""serious and sincere stance"". Where are the talks and how did they come about? They were held in the Panmunjom ""peace village"" in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the border. Five senior officials on each side attended and the leaders of both were said to have watched the talks via a CCTV feed. Media caption Tensions are high between the two warring countries In his New Year address, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had said he was considering sending a team to the Olympics. South Korea's Olympics chief had said last year that the North's athletes would be welcome. Following Mr Kim's overture, the South then proposed high-level talks to discuss the North's participation, but the North only agreed to the talks after the US and South Korea agreed to delay their joint military exercises until after the Olympics. The North sees the annual drills as a rehearsal for war. Some critics in the US see the North's move as an attempt to divide the US-South Korea alliance. Dramatic change Analysis: BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Seoul A little over a week ago North Korea was threatening nuclear war - this morning a delegation from Pyongyang strode across the demarcation line that divides North and South Korea and agreed a North Korean delegation would attend the Pyeongchang Games. It is a sudden and dramatic change after months of tension but few in the South believe any of this demonstrates a fundamental shift in Pyongyang's position. Experts say North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has become increasingly fearful that the US is planning a military strike against him, and has decided he must do something to de-escalate tensions. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has been put in the delicate position of trying to engage the North in genuine dialogue, while not upsetting his very sceptical American ally. When were the last talks? Back in 2015. Relations then broke down after Seoul suspended a joint economic project at the Kaesong Industrial complex in North Korea following a rocket launch and nuclear test by the North. The incident led to North Korea ending all communication with Seoul, including cutting off the military hotline. Media caption Life in a South Korean border town Tensions have risen in the years since. How bad have things become? The North's development of its nuclear programme has continued unabated and has created a huge diplomatic conflict with the US administration of President Donald Trump. Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un have conducted a personal feud, with the US leader dubbing Mr Kim ""Rocket Man"" and boasting that his nuclear button is ""much bigger"". North Korea's regular missile tests have brought a tightening of UN and US sanctions. The latest test of a ballistic missile on 28 November sparked another raft of measures from the UN, targeting petrol shipments and travel for North Koreans, among other things.","At their first meeting in two years, the North also says it will send a team to the Olympics.",2018-01-09T13:05:00Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Koreas agree military talks to defuse border tension,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42622588,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05t86my.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tension,1
CHERYL MAGUIRE,"Dr. Solomon recommends avoiding this kind of overreaction by practicing mindful parenting, which involves pausing, regulating your emotions and staying present in the moment, without attaching a story or meaning to the behavior. Research studies have found that using this technique can improve the quality of parent-child relationships.
Its hard to control what your teen does, but you can control your reaction to it, said KJ DellAntonia, former editor of The New York Timess parenting blog Motherlode and author of How to be a Happier Parent: Raising a Family, Having a Life, and Loving (Almost) Every Minute. If I walk away, it changes my experience.
Say to your teenager: This isnt working for either of us. What can we do to fix it? Maybe the coat closet is near the front door and your kids dont use it because they come in through the back door. Could you install a coat hook near the back door?
Once you have a plan, even if there is only a small improvement, praise your child for doing a good job and acknowledge that you have a better relationship because you are working together.
Parents may want to think of themselves as coaches, helping their child practice instead of being disciplinarians, said Dr. Carla Naumburg, a clinical social worker and author of parenting books including Ready, Set, Breathe: Practicing Mindfulness With Your Children for Fewer Meltdowns and a More Peaceful Family.
Getting mad at your child isnt going to change the behavior, she said. When you get angry, your attention is on the conflict instead of figuring out a solution to the problem.
If you have setbacks, ask your child, Where do you think we went wrong?
Approach situations with curiosity. If your son doesnt get out of bed, dont say, You are tired because you stayed up too late. Dr. Solomon said. Instead ask, Why do you think you are tired?

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright KEVIN DIETSCH / POOL Image caption Mr Tillerson and Mr Trump share a complex relationship The US secretary of state's job security is uncertain. That much is clear following reports that the White House is considering a plan to replace Rex Tillerson with CIA director Mike Pompeo because of tensions between the former and Donald Trump, something that has been rumoured for months. But the White House says it has no personnel announcements to make. And the State Department says it is business as usual. Meanwhile this drama is further disrupting the already dysfunctional way foreign policy is run in this administration. So here are my takeaways on where things stand. Takeaway 1: A complex relationship It clearly has not been a happy one since the summer, starting with Mr Trump's politicised speech to the Boy Scouts of America, an organisation that Mr Tillerson used to head. The secretary of state also distanced himself from the president's equivocal response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Then there was that extraordinary moment in October when Mr Trump suggested an IQ-test challenge after a report that Mr Tillerson had called him a moron (which the latter denounced but did not deny, although his spokeswoman eventually did). The two have also aired striking policy differences in public: several times Mr Trump has openly undermined Mr Tillerson's positions with his tweets. Yet the president has quietly accepted his secretary of state's diplomatic strategy on some issues, such as dealing with North Korea tensions, co-operating with Russia for a political settlement of the Syrian civil war, and agreeing to punt the Iran nuclear deal to Congress rather than abandoning it outright. He also gave Mr Tillerson a shout out during his recent trip to Asia, where the two men shared plenty of quality time. But they are chalk and cheese in temperament and the way they work, which matters to a president who operates on instinct and interaction. And Mr Tillerson has not really learned to play the game of Washington politics - nor does he seem interested in doing so. Which means that if this is a game to try and force him out, it is not clear if he will follow the rules. Mr Pompeo plays it well and has cultivated a relationship with Mr Trump, making a point of delivering his intelligence briefings in person. His positions are also much more in line with Mr Trump's tough approach to national security. Takeaway 2: A deeply dysfunctional house I am struck by the parallel universes inhabited by the secretary and his critics at the state department. According to Mr Tillerson, it is functioning well - figures show about the same number of Foreign Service Officers now as this time last year. It is not being hollowed out, Mr Tillerson says: such reports offend him on behalf of the hardworking career diplomats who have stepped into acting roles during an excruciatingly slow process of appointing political nominees. As for his controversial redesign of the department, he says changes to its organisation and technology are badly needed. No one disputes that the state department needs to be dragged into the 21st Century. And at least one anecdotal report from someone who is engaged with the ""employee-led"" process sounded upbeat about the prospects for organisational reform. But we don't hear much from these employees leading the process, we do not hear much of anything at all. More importantly to veteran diplomats, Mr Tillerson has not spelled out what strategy and priorities lie behind his drawing board: the department will be smaller and more efficient, but what will it be for? And even if the numbers are stable, the expertise is draining away. Dozens of senior officials have been removed from their positions or taken early retirement. Hiring and promotion freezes mean they are not currently being replaced. Communication is a serious problem: between Mr Tillerson's staff and the rest of the building, and with the press. Those of us who travel with the secretary find him personable, straightforward, and seriously engaged with the issues. But there is no importance placed on delivering his message to the wider public. He travels in a smaller plane, which means a scaled back staff that does not give regular updates about his movements, and turns the trips into logistical nightmares. Morale at the state department is rock bottom. Takeaway 3: How can he do his job? The political intrigue that may unseat Mr Tillerson is separate from the state of the state department, but together they have undercut the effectiveness of US diplomacy. And all this has contributed to confusion about what America stands for. ""The whole administration suffers from not having articulated a clear vision for what American foreign policy is beyond the bumper sticker slogan of America First,"" Harvard international affairs professor Stephen Walt told me. Nor have they articulated how they will achieve that with a reformed state department. Mr Tillerson has begun to try and define policy in a more systematic way region by region. His recent speech on Europe was the least ""America First"" one I have heard from this administration - extolling historic ties and emphasising the importance of and commitment to the transatlantic alliance in the face of a resurgent Russia. But when he travels to Europe next week, will he be taken seriously? How much weight will governments there give his words if he does not appear to have the president's confidence? And how much longer can he operate this way, even if he is not sacked?","The US secretary of state has a complex relationship with Donald Trump, but what is behind the tension?",2017-12-01T06:13:37Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Trumplomacy: Why Rex Tillerson is in trouble,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42191418,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4B0B/production/_99011291_tillerson.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tension,1

Here's a who's who of the people pictured, and where they stand on the trade row: 1. Donald Trump, US president: Mr Trump shocked America's allies - namely the EU, Mexico and Canada - when he recently announced a 25% tariff on imports of steel and 10% on aluminium from these countries. They are all threatening retaliatory measures and the rift overshadowed the summit leaving the American president isolated at times. Mr Trump departed early, complaining that America was ""like the piggy bank that everybody is robbing"". But his relationship with fellow G7 leaders was at ""10 out of 10"". 2. John Bolton, US national security adviser: It's been just three months since he was appointed President Trump's top security adviser, but John Bolton has already made an impact. One of the president's arguments for the tariffs is on ""national security grounds"" - a view Mr Bolton has stridently backed. 3. Unidentified 4. Shinzo Abe, Japan prime minister: The Japanese leader has come under increased pressure to join retaliatory measures against America's steep tariffs. It puts Shinzo Abe in a difficult position - the Japanese premier has tried hard to cultivate a warm relationship with President Trump and the two are said to have met at least 10 times since he was elected to the White House. 5. Unidentified 6. Angela Merkel, German chancellor: The German leader has been at the forefront of talks to try to resolve differences at the summit, as is clear in this photo. Mrs Merkel apparently floated an idea to set up a mechanism to resolve trade disputes between the US and its allies on Friday. Asked during the summit about her relationship with President Trump, Mrs Merkel said the two leaders did not always agree, but could talk to each other: ""I can say that I maintain a very open and direct relationship with the American president."" 7. Emmanuel Macron, French president: Emmanuel Macron engaged in a Twitter spat with President Trump over the tariffs just hours before it was due to start - leading some to question whether the blossoming ""bromance"" between the two was over. Despite this, they were seen at the summit on good terms, and President Macron's team said his talks with Trump were ""frank and robust"". 8. Theresa May, UK prime minister: In a telephone call last week, Mrs May told President Trump she found the US tariffs ""unjustified and deeply disappointing"". But she also struck a more conciliatory tone at the summit, urging fellow leaders to step back from the brink of a possible trade war. 9. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council: President Trump's top economic adviser has defended Donald Trump's move to increase tariffs and says his boss should not be held responsible for mounting trade conflicts with US allies. Mr Kudlow addressed reporters on the second day of the summit voicing his backing of the president's call for eliminating all tariffs between G7 nations, saying it was the ""best way to promote economic growth"".",A photo posted by the German chancellor shows the level of tension at the G7 summit in Canada.,2018-06-09T18:31:32Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Trump at G7: Who's who in Merkel's photo?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44426442,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13AAB/production/_101955508_77703956-b037-4509-9fa6-84e91613f984.png,bbc-news,BBC News,tension,1

"Barbara Starr, Zachary Cohen, Elise Labott, Kaitlan Collins and Jamie Gangel, CNN","Washington (CNN) With tensions flaring between President Donald Trump and national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the Pentagon is considering options that would allow the President to potentially move the three-star general out of his current role and back into the military, according to half a dozen defense and administration officials. A search is quietly being conducted by the Pentagon to see if there is a four-star military job suited for McMaster, these officials said. Several sources told CNN that the push for a replacement comes after months of personal tension between McMaster and Trump. The task of easing McMaster out of his role as national security adviser presents a unique challenge for the White House. While administration officials have privately said the preference is to move McMaster into a position within the Army or Defense Department that qualifies as a promotion, some within the Pentagon feel he has become politicized in the White House and have expressed reservations about him returning to the military in a prominent role. Some defense officials caution that the President could also go as far as not to offer him a fourth star and force him to retire. This is not the first time McMaster has faced speculation that his job may be in jeopardy and sources with knowledge of McMaster's standing in the White House have repeatedly said that he has been on thin ice for months. There was discussion in the West Wing about replacing him last fall, but he ultimately survived because officials, including the President himself, were skeptical about the optics of appointing a third national security adviser in less than a year, several sources told CNN. Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned amid controversy over his contact with Russian officials within a month of taking the job. The decision was also driven by the White House's challenge attracting top talent for jobs in the administration due to Trump's ""blacklist"" of individuals who have criticized the President, his personality and the Russia investigation, according to a senior Republican source. However, those familiar with the President's thinking don't believe McMaster's job is any safer now. ""He is safe until he's not,"" the senior Republican with knowledge of the White House added. The White House did not respond to CNN's request for comment. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday that Trump ""still has confidence in General McMaster."" Tensions between Trump and McMaster have been playing out for months and were on full display this weekend after Trump publicly chided him over remarks he made regarding Russian interference in the election. ""General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems,"" Trump tweeted. ""Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!"" The criticism laid bare the strained relationship between the two men and left some wondering how much longer McMaster has left in the administration. For months, Trump has privately expressed irritation with McMaster stemming from differences in ""personality and style,"" the senior Republican source said. The two have never gotten along, and Trump continues to chafe at McMaster's demeanor when he briefs him, feeling that he is gruff and condescending, according to a source who is familiar with his thinking. He prefers the briefing style of someone like CIA Director Mike Pompeo or Defense Secretary James Mattis, who patiently answer his questions, regardless of the premise. McMaster, meanwhile, is the person who delivers the news that Trump doesn't want to hear on a daily basis, according to the senior Republican source. The issue is not political but mostly stylistic, as McMaster and Mattis tend to discuss information before it is presented to the President, the same source added. CNN previously reported that McMaster has been at odds with the President and other cabinet officials over the last year. He has also been undercut by others in Trump's orbit like former chief strategist Steve Bannon, according to congressional and administration officials. A source familiar with the situation said Trump's perception of McMaster is still influenced by the legacy of Bannon who maintained a tense relationship with McMaster after McMaster removed him from the National Security Council. ""He paid McMaster back by spreading rumors and whispering in Trump's ear,"" the senior Republican source said, adding that ""Bannon poisoned the well."" What's next for McMaster? Officials could not yet confirm what job McMaster might be nominated for if he were to leave the White House. The current commander of US forces in South Korea, General Vincent Brooks, is expected to leave his post on a scheduled rotation in the coming months but his successor has already been earmarked within the Army but not yet made public, several officials said. Another possible option would be to name McMaster as the replacement for Gen. John Nicholson who has served as commander of the coalition in Afghanistan since 2016. Some officials have told CNN that the Pentagon may be looking to identify a slot that is not too high profile, because McMaster would be transitioning back to the military from a White House position akin to a political appointee. If moved back into a military role that involves testifying before Congress, McMaster might be viewed as simply supporting the White House rather than providing lawmakers with his best military advice, one defense official said. Lawmakers on the Senate Armed Services Committee would likely have questions about McMaster's time in the White House should he be nominated for a military role but an aide to one senior Republican member told CNN that there do not appear to be any obvious red flags at the outset that would inherently prevent his confirmation. A second defense official said McMaster is well aware of those political sensitivities. However, one top Pentagon official said McMaster's role in the administration should not prevent him from earning his fourth star, comparing his transition to other military officers like Colin Powell who have gone back and forth between the Pentagon and the White House. McMaster would also have the option of retiring from active duty at any time if he chose to do so. But officials told CNN that the White House's wish is to find McMaster a four-star job that is seen as acknowledging his service.","With tensions flaring between President Donald Trump and national security adviser Lt.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption So how does a G20 summit work? World leaders are gathering in Argentina for their annual G20 summit amid new tension with Russia over Ukraine and a US trade row with China. US President Donald Trump has cancelled a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in protest at Russia's seizure of Ukrainian naval boats. Hopes of progress over tariffs in Mr Trump's expected talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping have been dampened. The trade war between the two economic giants may possibly even escalate. The summit is also a diplomatic test for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman amid continuing questions about the Saudi state's possible involvement in the murder last month of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. Meanwhile, a massive security operation is under way for the summit in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, where a bank holiday has been declared for Friday and the city's main business district has been shut down. Who may have a 'couple of extra hours' free at the summit? Russia captured three Ukrainian naval vessels and 24 personnel in the Black Sea this week after accusing them of trespassing. Media caption Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Mr Trump said he would not meet the Russian leader ""based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned"". Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, responded: ""If this is so, the president will have a couple of extra hours in the programme for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel blamed the crisis ""entirely"" on Russia and said she would raise the issue with Mr Putin. Mrs Merkel's own arrival at the summit has been delayed by a technical fault in her plane. How intense is the trade war? President Trump said recently that current tariff levels on $200bn (£157bn) of Chinese imports would rise as planned. He also threatened tariffs on $267bn of other Chinese exports to the US. Speaking to reporters at the White House, he said that while China was interested in striking a deal, ""I don't know if I want to do it"" and ""I like the deal we have now"". The US has hit a total of $250bn of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. ""I think the most likely scenario is that [Chinese President] Xi Jinping doesn't offer big enough concessions to Trump, and so nothing much comes of the G20 meeting,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics. What can Crown Prince Mohammed expect? International indignation over Khashoggi's murder, which was carried out inside Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul on 2 October, continued on Thursday as Canada slapped sanctions on 17 Saudi nationals allegedly linked to his murder. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will meet the crown prince and deliver a ""very clear"" message. ""In relation to Mr Khashoggi, we want to see a full and transparent investigation of what happened and those responsible being held to account,"" she said. Just what is the G20? The Group of Twenty brings together leaders of 19 of the world's most industrialised nations plus the EU. Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the UK and the US are all represented. The focus of the two-day summit opening on Friday is ""fair and sustainable development"", according to the event's website. Last year's summit, in the German city of Hamburg, was marred by violent protests. Image copyright Reuters Image caption A ""Baby Trump"" balloon has appeared in Buenos Aires In Buenos Aires, which hosts the first G20 meeting to be held in South America, more than 20,000 police have been deployed to maintain order. Bad timing for Argentina's leader By Katy Watson, South America correspondent, BBC News This was meant to be a big moment for Argentina. A chance to show world leaders that with Mauricio Macri at the helm, the country meant business. When he was elected in 2015, Mr Macri promised market-friendly reforms to get Argentina's isolated economy back on track. Fast-forward three years and he's hosting this summit in a new political era - one where protectionism and populism, not globalisation, are the order of the day. And while over the next few days Mr Macri will want to make a good impression for his visitors, he's struggling with his reputation closer to home. Inflation is high, economic growth is sluggish, the peso has plummeted and the country has had to rely on a $57bn loan from the deeply unpopular IMF to try to get itself out of the crisis. It's not great timing for a president who is expected to seek re-election next year.",World leaders gather in Argentina amid tension with Russia over Ukraine and a US trade row with China.,2018-11-30T05:46:59Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Russia-Ukraine crisis clouds G20 summit in Buenos Aires,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46395758,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06t7nx5.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tension,1

We’ve got a few ways to help you through the tough time of ignoring your emails and texts for the sake of your sanity. That fancy OLED screen on your device is bright, colorful, and perfect for drawing your attention away from whatever you should be doing. Take a stand against its bright, enticing glow by making it a dull, black and white landscape. The muted screen is less attractive compared to its bright and saturated colorful counterpart, hopefully making you take the time to think about why you want to fiddle with your phone before you do. Spending your time on Instagram and Twitter isn’t doing anything good for your self-esteem. Study after study show the more time people spend on social media, the worse they feel about themselves, the more bad news they read, and the more they compare themselves to other people and their seemingly perfect lives. Do yourself a favor and get off Facebook, perhaps to stick your face in a real book. You could always psych yourself out whenever you use your smartphone and tell yourself it’s a bit on the slow side. Although, if your phone is a few years old, it might actually be slower than ever thanks to Apple’s recent reveal that it underclocks older iPhones to avoid damaging components. All the more reason to leave it in your pocket and learn to live without it. Instead of managing your smartphone, why not manage your self control? You might be pulling out your phone to play some Clash Royale when you should be studying for your final exam, or finishing that report for your afternoon meeting. If that’s the case, you should edit your phone so it’s more helpful when it does need your attention by modifying your notifications. Using your phone less might mean more than just putting it down. You might have to just leave it out of sight. Even leaving your phone on your desk takes away some precious brain power you could be using to study for a test, or learn a new language.

David Murphy,"iOS: One of the best parts of any science-fiction game or movie are those ominous tones that suggest a conversation or discovery is about to head south—a quintessential part of the soundtrack that adds a lot of atmosphere ( and tension ) to an experience. And now, thanks to an open-source iOS app, you can make your own imposing synthesizer sounds and teach yourself the basics of music production. AudioKit’s Synth One app is completely free to download and use, which is remarkable enough given how fully featured this virtual synthesizer is. Fire it up, and you’ll have more than 300 individual presets to try—which are fun enough to load and play using the app’s built-in keyboard. From there, the sky is the proverbial limit. And I’ve found that the best way to understand what the app’s many buttons, dials, and options do is to take a trial-and-error approach. How do different effects change the nature of the sound you’ve created? What happens when you change the shape of your synth’s reverb? Add in detuning? Fiddle with the attack, delay, and sustain of a sequence? Is it more fun to make arpeggios instead? Can you recreate Interstellar’s soundtrack? (Try preset #12: BB Power Down.) While Synth One’s interface might look incredibly imposing at first—and that’s just after checking out one of the many pages of options you can flip through—don’t let it deter you. Play around. Make some spooky science fiction noises or interesting melodies. Watch a tutorial (or two) if you need a bit more hand-holding to create the perfect audio loop that’s sitting in your head: If you want to get fancy, you can even sync up the app with a MIDI keyboard if you’d rather plunk physical keys instead of virtual ones. You can also record your synths and drop them into other apps, like GarageBand, so you can use your original creations (or presets you tweaked) as a component of a larger piece of music. Even if you don’t know the first thing about music, creating audio, or synthesizers, Synth One is like a musical version of a drawing app. You might not be the next Picasso, but it’s fun to doodle around when you’re bored.

This year, however, we can strive to avoid the traffic with the internet’s help.

SHERYL GAY STOLBERG,"WASHINGTON Democratic leaders are planning to put a resolution condemning anti-Semitism and bigotry on the House floor for a vote on Thursday, hoping to put to rest the internal uproar that erupted after Representative Ilhan Omar insinuated that backers of Israel exhibit dual loyalty.
The language of the resolution is still being drafted, and leaders intend to bring it to a vote only if they are convinced the Democratic Caucus is behind it. But Democrats are confident that they can unite the caucus, and they want to get the fight over Ms. Omar out of the way before they vote on one of their signature pieces of legislation, the democracy reform bill known as H.R. 1, on Friday.
The debate over anti-Semitism and bigotry has dominated discussion on Capitol Hill all week, overshadowing the Democrats agenda and giving Republicans an opening to attack the democracy reform bill while Democrats were busy fighting among themselves.

AMANDA HESS,"This represents a dramatic mood shift for the genre. The stud of the television dating scene is The Bachelor and its spinoffs, and though it is sheathed in the trappings of romance red roses, votive candles, diamond rings it plays most of its love-seekers as fools, assigning them job titles like pantsapreneur and twin and scoring them with dopey circus music. Then it drives the rest of its contestants mercilessly toward marriage even though it knows that most of its engagements are soon broken. (The fact that the show has promoted suitors with histories of racism and sexual assault only heightens the cynicism; its not clear how a series as sincere as Dating Around would weather such a scandal.) While there are pleasures to be found there its spectacle of gender stereotypes scratches a kind of itch it is only natural to yearn for a deeper connection.
The level of interference in Dating Around feels similar to that found on dating apps; whether by producer or by algorithm, strangers are selected to meet. In place of the brittle gender roles of The Bachelor, Dating Around offers a mélange of identities: There are people on the show who identify as straight, gay, bisexual, soft-aggressive, femme, dominant and stud; more than one has a drag persona. And if a dater shows up with an expertly waxed mustache or some underdeveloped flirtation skills, these quirks are not edited to loom grotesquely over their entire personalities; dates are awkward enough as they really are.
The shows queasiest moments come when daters appear to be operating in a different reality television universe. One does not get the sense that Justin was sincerely chosen as a remotely likely love match for Gurki; Sarah, a technology recruiter, spits lines that feel so fastidiously rehearsed that they would not seem out of place on the Next bus.
Critics of reality television harp on how unreal it all is. It can feel like the smart and knowing move for a show to lean into its artifice. Placing itself at a cynical remove pre-emptively guards against criticism. Nothing matters, and it doesnt really care. But Dating Around embraces its vulnerability, dangling in the space between documentary and drama.

BBC Monitoring,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (L) and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been regional rivals, but tensions between the two have recently soared.Each has its own powerful allies, and enemies, in the region. Here is where the key players stand: Saudi Arabia The Sunni-dominated kingdom is home to the birthplace of Islam and contains the most important sites in the Islamic world. It is one of the world's top oil exporters and among its wealthiest countries. Saudi Arabia fears Iran wants to dominate the Middle East and is opposed to the Shia-led power's growing involvement and influence in the region. Its belligerence towards Iran appears to have been emboldened by US President Donald Trump's equally tough position. The young and increasingly powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is waging a long war against Houthi rebels in neighbouring Yemen. The Saudis say the rebels are materially supported by Iran, a claim Tehran denies. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Saudi Arabia leads a coalition that has attacked the Houthis in Yemen and blockaded the country Saudi Arabia also backs rebels in Syria and wants to remove its president, Bashar al-Assad, who is a key ally of Iran. Saudi Arabia has one of the best-equipped militaries in the region and is among the biggest arms importers in the world. It has an estimated 227,000 troops. Iran Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979, when the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini. The vast majority of Iran's 80m-strong population are Shia Muslims, and the country is the leading Shia power in the region. Current leader Ali Khamenei has the final say on major foreign and domestic policy issues. Iran's influence has grown considerably in the past decade, especially after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Iran has supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his fight against opposition groups and the so-called Islamic State (IS). Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has been instrumental in advances against Sunni jihadists in Syria as well as in Iraq. Iran also believes Saudi Arabia is trying to destabilise Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Shia movement Hezbollah is part of the government. Iran considers the US its main adversary. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The IRGC is a major military, political and economic force in Iran Iran is reported to have some of the most advanced missile systems in the region. It has over 534,000 personnel in active service, which includes the regular army and the IRGC. US US-Iran relations have been strained to say the least. Key events affecting them have included the CIA-orchestrated overthrow of Iran's prime minister in 1953, the Islamic revolution in Iran, and the taking of hostages at the US embassy in Tehran in the 1980s. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, has always been a US ally, though relations were strained under Barack Obama's administration, particularly given its engagement policy with Iran. President Trump vowed to take a harder line on Iran - and he has, disavowing the landmark nuclear deal Iran signed under the Obama administration. In contrast, the White House and Saudi royals have rolled out the red carpet for each other. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US has long been a key backer of Saudi Arabia Neither Mr Trump nor his administration have criticised radical Islam in the Kingdom in the same way they link Iran to terrorism. Nor are Saudis on the list of foreign nationals on his controversial travel ban. Donald Trump's first trip abroad as president was to the Middle East, where he met Saudi and Israeli leaders, who have a common desire to stem Iran's regional influence. Saudi Arabia is the primary destination for US arms sales. Russia Russia is an ally of both Saudi Arabia and Iran, having close economic ties with each. It has also sold advanced weaponry to both countries. Russia appears not to have taken a particular side in the crisis between Tehran and Riyadh, indicating instead that it is ready to act as a mediator. Moscow's involvement in the Middle East goes back to the Cold War times, when the Soviet Union provided arms and training for Syria's military officers. Its influence in Syria and in the region in general subsided after the fall of the Soviet Union but Moscow has striven to increase it of late. Russia's air offensive in the Syrian war helped turn the tide in Bashar al-Assad's favour, and the Iran-backed fighters supporting him. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Syrian and Russian forces have liberated over 90 per cent of the country's territory Turkey Turkey has trod a fine line between Iran and Saudi Arabia in the fast-moving military and political developments in the Middle East. Ankara has become more involved in regional matters since the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party came to power in 2002. Turkey, a Sunni power, has established strong ties with Saudi Arabia over their sectarian kinship and mutual opposition toward the Syrian government. Despite a deep mistrust of Iran, Turkey also recently forged an alliance with it against the growing Kurdish influence in the region, which both countries perceive as a threat. Image copyright ADEM ALTAN Image caption Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has also backed Qatar in its row with Saudi Arabia Israel The state of Israel was declared in 1948 with a majority Jewish population but, in the Arab world, only has diplomatic relations with Egypt and Jordan. Iran and Israel are arch-foes. Iran rejects Israel's right to exist and calls for it to be eradicated. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly urged the international community to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and has also called for the annulment of Iran's landmark nuclear deal to curb what he calls its ""aggressive"" policy in the region. He has said there is a level of co-operation with some Arab countries in the region to counter Iran's growing influence. Saudi Arabia has denied reports in Israeli media that a high-level Saudi prince secretly visited Israel for talks in September. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has congratulated Donald Trump for ""boldly confronting Iran's terrorist regime"". Egypt Egypt has often played a central role in Middle East politics and has historically had better relations with Saudi Arabia than Iran, particularly after the Islamic revolution. Saudi Arabia also supported the Egyptian army's removal of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013. However, there have been occasions of rapprochement between Egypt and Iran, such as when Iran sponsored an Egyptian-Iraqi oil deal after Saudi Aramco halted its oil exports to Egypt in October 2016. Amid recent heightened tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi called for ""avoiding escalation of tension in the region, but not at the expense of the Gulf's security and stability"". Image copyright DON EMMERT Image caption ""Gulf national security is Egyptian national security. I have faith in the wise and firm leadership of Saudi Arabia,"" Mr Sisi has said. Syria The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad strongly sides with Iran in its standoff with Saudi Arabia. Iran has traditionally backed the Syrian leadership and has been providing military and personnel support to the Syrian army in its fight against rebels and jihadist groups. Iran sees Mr Assad, a member of the heterodox Shia Alawite sect, as its closest Arab ally. Syria is also the main transit point for Iranian weapons shipments to the Shia group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to back the Syrian government. Correspondents say that due to its training and equipment, the group is now viewed as a fully-fledged army rather than a semi-amateur militia. The Syrian government often accuses Saudi Arabia of adopting subversive policies in the Middle East. Image copyright STRINGER Image caption Syrian forces have slowly but surely been recapturing territory from IS Lebanon Lebanon's stance on the Saudi-Iran standoff is mixed. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who announced his resignation from Saudi Arabia a few days ago, has very good relations with the Saudi government and sides with it against Iran. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Lebanese prime minister resigned recently, while on a visit to Saudi Arabia On the other hand, Lebanese Hezbollah is an ally of Iran, which provides it with considerable support. Its leader Hassan Nasrallah has often attacked the Saudi government. Gulf States The Gulf States of Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait have had friendlier ties with Saudi Arabia than Iran in the past. But Qatari-Saudi ties have suffered since Qatar defied a demand from Saudi Arabia for it to curb ties with Iran earlier this year. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Saudi Arabia says it wants Qatar to do more to combat extremism and terrorism After Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain imposed a blockade on Qatar in July, Iran sent five planeloads of food to Qatar to help it over food shortages. In August, Qatar and Iran restored full diplomatic relations which had previously been dropped over attacks on two Saudi diplomatic facilities in Iran. Bahrain and Kuwait lean toward Saudi Arabia though. Bahrain's Sunni king and his family hold the main political and military posts there but about 70% of the country is Shia. Bahrain has accused Iran of training ""terrorist cells"" to operate inside the country to overthrow its government. It also accuses the Shia opposition of maintaining links with Iran. The government said in October that ""it is one of the countries most affected by the expansionist policy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards"". Although Kuwait is not imposing a blockade on Qatar, its government has shifted from an earlier stance of siding with Iran, to siding with Saudi Arabia. In February, it called for improving Arab-Iranian relations and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani visited for the first time since he was elected in 2013 to discuss Iran-GCC tensions. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kuwait's emir also offered to mediate in talks between Doha and Riyadh Following the Saudi-Qatar crisis, however, Kuwait expelled 15 Iranian diplomats and shut down related military, cultural and trade missions in the country.

JAMES PONIEWOZIK,"But unlike other bad-guy cable protagonists, they do it out of principle, however misguided. Elizabeth believes passionately in socialism. Philip’s politics are shakier, his loyalties more personal. They’re soldiers, recruited at a young age in Russia for an arranged marriage that over the years became a real one. Philip’s bowing out has left them distanced. He’s always been more at home in America than she has. Now he’s all-in, giving motivational speeches about salesmanship and taking up country line dancing. She’s overworked and overstressed, juggling multiple covert operations. The divide in their relationship parallels the one back at home, where the reformer Mikhail S. Gorbachev is being resisted by hard-liners in the K.G.B., who pull Elizabeth into a plot to undermine an arms summit meeting in Washington. She can tell Philip about none of this. Glasnost may be stirring in Russia, but an Iron Curtain is descending in their home. It’s a jarring development in a series that’s been a story of marriage as equal partnership. In the season premiere, when Elizabeth bitingly cuts off Philip’s attempt to get her to open up about work — “I know you love to talk, ” she says, dismissively — it’s as breathtaking as any act of violence in the series. Photo Paige (Holly Taylor), the idealistic daughter, has been drawn into the spy life. Credit Eric Liebowitz/FX Where the previous season dragged — it was more like the first half of a season, all prelude — this one opens with a sense of things closing in. The first few hours suggest any number of ways things can end in heartbreak: for Oleg (Costa Ronin), a principled former K.G.B. agent who supports the reforms; for the Jenningses’ F.B.I. agent friend Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich), who’s unwittingly been on their trail for years; for their son, Henry (Keidrich Sellati), happily oblivious to his family’s origins. That’s true above all for their idealistic daughter, Paige (Holly Taylor), now in college, whom Elizabeth has been easing into the spy life. As nerve-racking as it is to watch, “The Americans” makes Elizabeth’s decision understandable from her perspective: If you believe this is a battle for the future of every child, how can you exempt your own? Espionage, it turns out, is a great bonding experience. Paige and Elizabeth spend hours with Claudia (Margo Martindale), Elizabeth’s handler, watching the Soviet movie melodrama “Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears” and cooking up a batch of zharkoye, a Russian peasant stew. Elizabeth reminisces to Paige about her own mother making giant pots of it to fend off starvation. Elizabeth is committed to Marxism as an idea, yes, but she’s fighting for more than an abstraction. Her nation is not just an ideology. It’s meat scraps and potatoes. It’s memory, taste, a history of shared privation and loss — an ancestral call that survives the rise and fall of regimes. All of this rings especially strong in 2018, when we know well that the end of the U.S.S.R. was not the end of history or of nationalism. It’s that melancholy intimacy that makes “The Americans” more than the sum of its wigs, stabbings and spot- on period-music choices. (No plot point in “The Americans” is as big a spoiler as its soundtrack selections, so I’ll keep them to myself.) The history itself is no spoiler; we know how the Cold War played out. But “The Americans” understands history as more than the record of which nations rise and fall. It’s also the story of individual people for whom life goes on, or doesn’t.

RANA F. SWEIS,"Mr. Pence had delayed his trip to the region amid the furor over Mr. Trump’s decisions, which were seen here as pro-Israel and a slap in the face to Palestinians, and Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, canceled a meeting with Mr. Pence planned for this trip. The Trump administration said the delay was unrelated to the rising anti-American sentiment in the Middle East. Mr. Pence called Mr. Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital “a historic decision,” but insisted that the United States takes “no position on boundaries and final status” issues. Those issues are “subject to negotiation,” he said, according to Petra. He also said that the United States was “committed to continue to respect Jordan’s role” as the custodian of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. There have been small but persistent protests in Jordan against Mr. Trump’s announcement last month, and over the weekend a small group of protesters held a sign saying that Mr. Pence was unwelcome in Jordan. The protests led to the closing of roads around the United States Embassy in Amman. “Jordan is a small country surrounded by conflict, and there’s tremendous pressure right now from the population to stand against U.S. and Israeli policies in the region,” said Oraib al-Rantawi, the director of the Quds Center for Political Studies in Jordan. But doing so is a delicate proposition for Jordan’s government, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is heavily dependent on American aid. The United States has provided Jordan with more than $15 billion in economic and military aid since the 1950s. In 2015, the Obama administration and Jordan signed a three-year agreement in which the United States pledged $1 billion annually in foreign assistance, subject to the approval of Congress. “Trump’s decision on Jerusalem represented Jordan’s worst fears when it comes to the peace process,” said Amer Sabaileh, a political analyst and columnist in Amman. “Yet Jordan knows perfectly well it’s impossible to go against the United States.” But recently there have been signs that Jordan’s role in the region is changing. Saudi Arabia’s strategic shift to align itself with Israel and the Trump administration in recent months, in an effort by all three countries to counter Iran, has diminished Jordan’s role as regional mediator with Israel and power broker in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. “Now that the regional axis of power is firmly in the Gulf, Jordan simply doesn’t have the strategic importance it used to,” said Sean Yom, an associate professor of political science at Temple University. In another blow to Jordan, the Trump administration announced last week that it would withhold $65 million in aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which aids Palestinian refugees. Mr. Trump had angrily called American aid to Palestinians worthless after Palestinian leaders said the United States should no longer play a role in peace talks with Israel. The State Department said the funding decision was intended to encourage other countries to increase aid and to promote reform at the relief agency. Unless other countries fill the gap, the reduced funding could have a huge impact on Jordan, which has more than two million registered Palestinian refugees who rely on the agency for education and health services. Several hundred thousand Palestinians live in 10 refugee camps administered by the agency. “The economic situation is already quite bad in Jordan, and Trump’s decision will impact people like us directly,” said Abdul Rahman Qanas, 52, a resident of the Baqaa refugee camp, the largest in Jordan with about 100,000 residents. The refugee agency provides Mr. Qanas with blood pressure medicine every month and routine checkups for his family. All of his children attended the agency’s schools. “Trump and Israel want to end the Palestinian cause; they want to erase the idea of Palestinian refugees,” he said. “They want to pressure Jordan, the Palestinians and others to give into the demands of an imaginary peace process that benefits only Israel, and that is unacceptable.” Mr. Pence is to continue his trip in Israel on Monday.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" Like all seemingly endless conflicts, the fighting in Syria long ago splintered into a number of mini wars. The original confrontation between the Syrian government and those trying to bring it down is now almost an irrelevance, with President Assad's position radically diminished but essentially unchallenged - while the very term rebel has become near-obsolete in the Syrian context. But where this might once have left a void, there is now a dizzying array of competing forces choking up the huge swathes of territory still beyond government control. The outside sponsors of those forces have moved through the years of the conflict from diplomacy to outright military intervention. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russia's air campaign to ""stabilise"" President Assad's government begain in 2015 Russia and Iran are the most deeply invested - financially, politically and militarily. They have accordingly gained the most in power and influence, but lost the most in fighters on the battlefield, and in the massive economic cost of rescuing President Assad from defeat. The US has ventured far less, never fully committing to genuine support of the rebels beyond rhetoric and handouts. The result has been a vertiginous fall in its ability to call the shots, and a lack of clarity about its goals. Turkey has been another major player - originally in its support of the rebels, but more recently in its determination to stop Syrian Kurds from carving out a mini state on its border - by launching a major incursion into northern Syria. To the south, Israel has sat out most of the conflict, loath to be drawn in - to the disastrous extent that it was during the 16 years of the civil war in Syria's neighbour, Lebanon. It has mostly limited itself to targeted attacks on alleged Iranian bases and suspected Hezbollah arms supplies. Through much of the conflict, the interests of these outside players were often opposed to each other - and the fact that their aims were mutually exclusive has ensured the failure of all attempts to end the war. But even as their interests have edged closer to collision, these outside powers have had the buffer of working through their proxy forces on the ground. When dangerous flashpoints have arisen, all sides have taken a step back to avoid further escalation, leaving Syrians - as ever - to suffer the consequences. Shared purpose The rise of the so-called Islamic State group (IS) may have introduced an even darker and more savage dimension to the conflict. But it also brought the temporary relief of a shared purpose in the effort to defeat the one combatant so iniquitous that almost every participant in the war finally saw it as their enemy. The US and the Russians and Iranians, the Turkish and the Kurds, even the regime, put their irreconcilable differences on hold just long enough to allow them to take on IS - if not as allies, at least not as battlefield rivals. The concerted power of the forces massed against IS inevitably proved too much for the jihadists, who lost their territory and returned to insurgency. But all the while this monumental battle was going on, it was actively creating new complications for the post-IS future. The Kurds with US backing took over more territory as they drove IS out - raising concern in Turkey over their growing power, to fever pitch. The Russians and Iranians entrenched themselves deeper in Syria - as the regime continued to recover more territory. After the defeat of IS, the US was left with little clarity to its mission in Syria - and even less influence. Israel saw battle-hardened Hezbollah and Iranian fighters move closer and closer to its border - prompting a more active, though still cautious, engagement in the conflict. Image copyright AFP Image caption Almost half of Syria's pre-war population of 23 million has been displaced by the war Talk of peace and de-escalation zones has grown in volume, but in many parts of Syria, it's still drowned out by the sound of shelling and aerial bombardment. Risk of deeper confrontation It may seem strange to talk of instability in Syria as if it's some new element in the war. But the increasing international commitment on its various battlefields runs the risk of shifting it from a war between proxies to one directly between the powers pulling the strings. And that is a highly dangerous development. Recent events have shown that the limited comfort that those involved will always pull back from the brink of deeper confrontation, may not be entirely reliable.

If nothing else, all this may only prolong the Syria war. But it raises fears of all-out confrontation between the outside players - all of whose interests remain as fundamentally opposed as they have been at any time in the conflict.",The increasing tension between the different countries with a stake in the Syrian conflict poses a real threat to the region.,2018-02-22T01:37:01Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43126727,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05yx5tj.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tension,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image caption Members of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity posing as Mexican gangsters A photo of a student partying in blackface caused days of tension on the campus of Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, California. Protests erupted, the university authorities walked a tightrope defending free speech, and racist graffiti made an appearance. Student journalist Megan Schellong was in the thick of it and tells the story. It's Monday 9 April 2018. All over campus students are talking about what's happened. The photograph of agricultural business student Kyler Watkins with his face painted black brought a quick apology from the fraternity - Lambda Chi Alpha - where the party took place. Its statement says an event was held at which teams were represented by colour, with a student using blackface to show he was on the black team. ""We are extremely sorry and embarrassed for failing to recognise the racial impacts this brought forth,"" it says. ""Although it was not our intention to stir up racial tensions, we understand the negative impact this picture had on our peers."" But then it turns out there is a second photograph, which shows other members of the fraternity posing as Mexican gangsters. They have racist anti-immigration messages scrawled on their arms as they flash fake gang signs, wearing baggy jeans, gold necklaces and bandanas. As close to 400 protesters march through campus, I spot a small group of onlookers jeering from the sidelines. They don't want to be named, but one tells me that the protest is out of proportion. He says Kyler Watkins should not be punished: ""It wasn't like he did it on purpose and posted stuff about it to offend people. It was just a personal choice, like he was drinking at a party, you know."" Listen to Megan Schellong on Blackface on Campus, at 20:00 on Monday 26 November on BBC Radio 4 Or catch up online There are 19 fraternities at Cal Poly and 17 sororities, their female equivalent, all with names drawn from the Greek alphabet. About a quarter of students are members. The Lambda Chi Alpha house sits in a sprawling complex stretching back from the street. Its name is chiselled into a concrete slab that stands at the foot of the drive, next to the American flag, but today a blue sheet of tarpaulin covers the sign and the house appears to be in lock-down. The university and the national Lambda Chi Alpha organisation have put the campus chapter of the fraternity on ""probationary suspension"", limiting its activities. I livestream a packed student meeting in the evening, where there are calls for Kyler Watkins to be expelled. A black student, Erica Green, says the photos offer proof that she's not welcome on her own campus. ""When I see that picture, it is kind of hard when all your life you're told that your skin is ugly, you know, you look dirty. The more I think about it, it doesn't make me feel that this campus wants people like me here."" She wants members of the fraternity to be ordered to complete a community service project in a minority community, ""so they honestly understand what it's like for them"". One thing you should know about Cal Poly is that out of 22,000 students only 166 are black - a tiny fraction. There are more students like me from from an Asian background - I was adopted as an infant from an orphanage in China and grew up in Connecticut before moving out to California for college. However, I have awareness of what it is like to sit slightly at odds with the mainstream. Monique Ejenuko, whose parents are from Nigeria, tells me that in her year only about 40 other students are black, a fact that really hit home on her first day. ""I just looked around and I was the only drop of blackness in that whole auditorium and I almost cried,"" she tells me. ""I was like - 'Oh my god, this is overwhelming. I just felt so alone."" I talk to Prof Elizabeth Sine about the history of blackface. She sees it as part of a racist tradition dating back to the minstrel shows of the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Image copyright Mustang News Image caption Minstrel performers from Cal Poly's 1915 yearbook White comedians would wear black face paint and caricature black people as lazy and ignorant, giving rise to the stereotype of the ""happy-go-lucky darky on the plantation"", or the ""dandified coon"". Blackface minstrel shows were, she says, a way of cementing a culture of white supremacy and racial hierarchy. In an apology to the student newspaper, the Mustang News, Kyler Watkins says his action had nothing to do with ""racism and discrimination"" and that he was unaware of this history. ""When I woke up Sunday morning to learn that 'blackface' is of historical racial significance, no words can express my regret and horror."" Soon, on the internet, I read about another scandal at Syracuse University in New York, where a fraternity has been suspended for a racist video showing members imitating sex acts and using racial slurs for black, Jewish and Hispanic people. Members are asked to pledge to always have hatred in their hearts for ""African-Americans, Hispanics and Jews"". One person in the video tells Jews to ""get in the shower"" - a reference to the gas chambers. Prof Sine feels that today's polarised political landscape may explain why racist outbreaks are in the headlines again. The next day, the organiser of Monday's student meeting, ethnic studies student Leilani Hemmings Pallay, is verbally abused as she stands, megaphone in hand, on the campus lawn. ""He was a tall white male and he walked up to me and yelled the N-word in my face. He then continued walking as if nothing had happened,"" she says. ""A lot of the work that I do here on campus puts a target on me, but I was shocked that it happened then and that this person had the audacity to say that."" Image caption Leilani Hemmings Pallay And the protests and counterprotests continue. At one point, flyers are posted in the corridors of the agribusiness department claiming that black people are a sub-species - racially inferior to Caucasians. Some show maps of the globe connecting skin tones to IQ and to incidents of rape and homicide. On Thursday, Prof Jeffrey Armstrong, the president of Cal Poly, holds an open forum, drawing a crowd of about 1,000 students. He condemns the blackface incident, but says it would not be right to expel Kyler Watkins. ""That's very likely protected by free speech and freedom of expression,"" he says. ""If a student walks around on campus with their face painted black, they can do that."" Image caption The Instagram picture that caused the outcry He refuses my request for an interview, as does the head of the university office of diversity and inclusion, but Prof Brian Kennelly from the department of world languages and cultures agrees. This is how our conversation goes. First I ask, does he believe that Kyler Watkins should have been expelled? I don't. Why is that? He didn't do anything illegal. Even though he did something that harmed so many students on this campus? He didn't do anything illegal. And that's is that the only reason? That would be a reason not to expel him. We then discuss his support for the idea of inviting the polemicist Milo Yiannopoulos to speak on campus, despite Yiannopoulos's links to white supremacists and the decision by Twitter to close his account because of his racist and sexist slurs. Why do you think that words that are hateful should be allowed? I'm a strong believer that speech should never be censored. Even if it's hateful and could hurt Absolutely, despite that. And that's the tricky situation in which we find ourselves in the United States. The most abhorrent speech, the most hateful speech is still speech that needs to be protected. Why do you believe that? It's in the constitution. On Tuesday 17 April, nine days after the photographs emerged, the university announces the suspension of all fraternities and sororities, citing not only the blackface photo, but another racially insensitive photo taken at a Sigma Nu fraternity event some weeks earlier, and also other racially charged events, sexual assaults and alcohol-related deaths over the past few years. The same day, the N-word was written in a bathroom in the agribusiness department, and posters about the importance of diversity were slashed with a knife. Seven months later a new academic year is under way. All new students attended a new mandatory diversity session during their welcome week. The suspension of the fraternities and sororities has been lifted. But none of us who witnessed the events of last spring have forgotten them. I remember a silent protest on 14 April when everyone wore black, some with tape over their mouths. It was empowering. I got the chills. I wanted to cry. I got goosebumps, the hairs were literally sticking up on my skin. Never in my four years at Cal Poly have I witnessed the extent of solidarity among a group of individuals who will not stand for human indecency and racism. But also that day a group of about 50 African American schoolchildren walked past with their parents and teachers. They were from a network of public charter schools that focuses on closing the African American achievement gap. Cal Poly's science and maths faculties have helped design the schools' coursework and campus tours take place regularly to help remind the youngsters of their education goals. ""That's the long game,"" said Margaret Fortune, the woman overseeing the schools. ""It may not get as much press as a frat boy in blackface, but it's what the campus is doing because they recognise that diversity is important, and I hope that doesn't get lost.""

KIRK SEMPLE,"The militarys handling of the throng at the pipeline revealed what he called a lack of technical capacity and policy, and said the troops should have been better prepared to handle the situation.
The circumstances in which the tragedy happened where you have massive theft, in the middle of a national battle against fuel theft made clear he doesnt know where to draw the line between protecting people and continuing the fight against the bad guys, Mr. Navalón said.
As part of the crackdown, which was launched in December, the administration shut down oft-targeted pipelines, shifting the transportation of fuel to tanker trucks. But that tactic caused distribution problems and widespread shortages at service stations.
Survivors of the pipeline explosion and other witnesses said some of the victims had gone to the pipeline rupture with their gasoline canisters because shortages had left them without fuel for their vehicles.
The widespread supply problems have left some observers with the sense the López Obrador administration had launched the crackdown without adequate planning.

ANNIE KARNI and MAGGIE HABERMAN,"Mr. Stepien, meanwhile, has been focused on the delegate selection process and state chairman races in places like Massachusetts, Florida and Maine, to ensure that the Republican National Convention next year will be an uninterrupted celebration of the president.

The spending rate has concerned some outside allies, who have raised questions about the extensive digital investment so early in the campaign. The billionaire Todd Ricketts has been named a finance chairman, reaching out with his team to the donors who were not supportive of Mr. Trump in 2016.
And the campaign has been focused on tying all of the potential Democratic 2020 nominees to the most progressive names in the party, branding them all as socialists whose views are too far to the left for general-election voters.

In Nogales, Ariz., the City Council on Wednesday passed a resolution condemning the recent installation of new barbed wire along the existing border wall in that city, calling it an indiscriminate use of lethal force that is typically only found in a war, battlefield or prison setting.
Gaining public support for the idea of a wall at an event such as the rally in El Paso will be important for Mr. Trump, as talks for a bipartisan agreement on border security appeared to have stalled on Sunday amid lingering disagreement over how much should be spent on a border barrier.

Rita Liao,"The US-China tension over Huawei is leaving telecommunications companies around the world at a crossroad, but one spoke out last week. Telus, one of Canada’s largest phone companies showed support for its Chinese partner despite a global backlash against Huawei over cybersecurity threats.
“Clearly, Huawei remains a viable and reliable participant in the Canadian telecommunications space, bolstered by globally leading innovation, comprehensive security measures, and new software upgrades,” said an internal memo signed by a Telus executive that The Globe and Mail obtained.
The Vancouver-based firm is among a handful of Canadian companies that could potentially leverage the Shenzhen-based company to build out 5G systems, the technology that speeds up not just mobile connection but more crucially powers emerging fields like low-latency autonomous driving and 8K video streaming. TechCrunch has contacted Telus for comments and will update the article when more information becomes available.
The United States has long worried that China’s telecom equipment makers could be beholden to Beijing and thus pose espionage risks. As fears heighten, President Donald Trump is reportedly mulling a boycott of Huawei and ZTE this year, according to Reuters. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that US federal prosecutors may bring criminal charges against Huawei for stealing trade secrets.
Australia and New Zealand have both blocked local providers from using Huawei components. The United Kingdom has not officially banned Huawei but its authorities have come under pressure to take sides soon.
Canada, which is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network alongside Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the US, is still conducting a security review ahead of its 5G rollout but has been urged by neighboring US to steer clear of Huawei in building the next-gen tech.
China has hit back at spy claims against its tech crown jewel over the past months. Last week, its ambassador to Canada Lu Shaye warned that blocking the world’s largest telecom equipment maker may yield repercussions.
“I always have concerns that Canada may make the same decision as the US, Australia and New Zealand did. And I believe such decisions are not fair because their accusations are groundless, Lu said at a press conference. “As for the consequences of banning Huawei from 5G network, I am not sure yet what kind of consequences will be, but I surely believe there will be consequences.”
Last week also saw Huawei chief executive officer Ren Zhengfei appear in a rare interview with international media. At the roundtable, he denied security charges against the firm he founded in 1987 and cautioned the exclusion of Chinese firms may delay plans in the US to deliver ultra-high-speed networks to rural populations — including to the rich.
“If Huawei is not involved in this, these districts may have to pay very high prices in order to enjoy that level of experience,” argued Ren. “Those countries may voluntarily approach Huawei and ask Huawei to sell them 5G products rather than banning Huawei from selling 5G systems.”
The Huawei controversy comes as the US and China are locked in a trade war that’s sending reverberations across countries that rely on the US for security protection and China for investment and increasingly skilled — not just cheap — labor.
Canada got caught between the feuding giants after it arrested Huawei’s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who’s also Ren’s daughter, at the request of US authorities. The White House is now facing a deadline at the end of January to extradite Meng. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Trump are urging Beijing to release two Canadian citizens who Beijing detained following Meng’s arrest.","The US-China tension over Huawei is leaving telecommunications companies around the world at a crossroad, but one spoke out last week.

Jon Russell,"Responding to criticism from his recent trip to Myanmar, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said he’s keen to learn about the country’s racial tension and human rights atrocities, but it has emerged that both he and Twitter’s public policy team ignored an opportunity to connect with a key civic group in the country. A loose group of six companies in Myanmar has engaged with Facebook in a bid to help improve the situation around usage of its services in the country — often with frustrating results — and key members of that alliance, including Omidyar-backed accelerator firm Phandeeyar, contacted Dorsey via Twitter DM and emailed the company’s public policy contacts when they learned that the CEO was visiting Myanmar. The plan was to arrange a forum to discuss the social media concerns in Myanmar to help Dorsey gain an understanding of life on the ground in one of the world’s fastest-growing internet markets. “The Myanmar tech community was all excited, and wondering where he was going,” Jes Kaliebe Petersen, the Phandeeyar CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. “We wondered: ‘Can we get him in a room, maybe at a public event, and talk about technology in Myanmar or social media, whatever he is happy with?'” The DMs went unread. In a response to the email, a Twitter staff member told the group that Dorsey was visiting the country strictly on personal time with no plans for business. The Myanmar-based group responded with an offer to set up a remote, phone-based briefing for Twitter’s public policy team with the ultimate goal of getting information to Dorsey and key executives, but that email went unanswered. When we contacted Twitter, a spokesperson initially pointed us to a tweet from Dorsey in which he said: “I had no conversations with the government or NGOs during my trip.” We know we cant do this alone, and continue to welcome conversation with and help from civil society and NGOs within the region. I had no conversations with the government or NGOs during my trip. Were always open to feedback on how to best improve. — jack (@jack) December 11, 2018 However, within two hours of our inquiry, a member of Twitter’s team responded to the group’s email in an effort to restart the conversation and set up a phone meeting in January. “We’ve been in discussions with the group prior to your outreach,” a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch in a subsequent email exchange. That statement is incorrect. Still, on the bright side, it appears that the group may get an opportunity to brief Twitter on its concerns on social media usage in the country after all. The micro-blogging service isn’t as well-used in Myanmar as Facebook, which has some 20 million monthly users and is practically the de facto internet, but there have been concerns in Myanmar. For one thing, there was been the development of a somewhat sinister bot army in Myanmar and other parts of Southeast Asia, while it remains a key platform for influencers and thought-leaders. “[Dorsey is] the head of a social media company and, given the massive issues here in Myanmar, I think it’s irresponsible of him to not address that,” Petersen told TechCrunch. “Twitter isnt as widely used as Facebook but that doesnt mean it doesn’t have concerns happening with it,” he added. “As wed tell Facebook or any large tech company with a prominent presence in Myanmar, it’s important to spend time on the ground like theyd do in any other market where they have a substantial presence.” The UN has concluded that Facebook plays a “determining” role in accelerating ethnic violence in Myanmar. While Facebook has tried to address the issues, it hasn’t committed to opening an office in the country and it released a key report on the situation on the eve of the U.S. mid-term elections, a strategy that appeared designed to deflect attention from the findings. All of which suggests that it isn’t really serious about Myanmar.","Responding to criticism from his recent trip to Myanmar, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said he’s keen to learn about the country’s racial tension and human rights atrocities, but it has emerged that both he and Twitter’s public policy team ignored an opportunity to…",2018-12-14T09:25:39Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Jack Dorsey and Twitter ignored opportunity to meet with civic group on Myanmar issues,http://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/jack-dorsey-twitter-myanmar-civic-group/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-1027231364.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,tension,1
Anthony Ha,"Dear White People has a pretty provocative title — and the show, for the most part, lives up to that promise, with a sharply drawn portrait of racial tension at Winchester University, a fictional Ivy League school. It was originally a film written and directed by Justin Simien, who then reinvented the story as a Netflix series with each episode focusing on a different character; the spotlight shifts from Samantha White (played by Logan Browning), the host of the titular radio show, to many of the other students — white and black — around her.

Lucas Matney,"The socially networked web is frightening enough, but maybe chatting with some friendly robots will ease the tension? Today, Mozilla showed off a preview of Hubs, a dead-simple social WebVR experience that users can dive into with a couple clicks, share a URL, and then meet up with other people across platforms, including mobile, desktop and VR. It’s not Second Life, or even Facebook Spaces, it’s pretty low-key. You’re just a humble robot hanging with other robots who are hopefully your friends. It’s admittedly kind of hilarious how childish so many of these social apps for VR look right now. It’s pretty much due to the marriage of PS1-level graphics and a club penguin social schema. The thing that’s really being tested here isn’t a lifelike approach to detail or nifty interface cues, it’s the bare bones simplicity of getting people into a social environment together and facilitating connections. The broader issues that Mozilla is tackling here are the same ones others are, though Mozilla is starting its efforts with a heavy approach to cross-platform compatibility by building Hubs entirely on WebVR. Mozilla says Hubs has support for all of the major VR headsets out now. Having the web as the backbone for the service is something that’s easy to take for granted, but with most social VR experiences requiring app stores and downloads, the idea of using a URL to dive into a social environment is oddly unique. Even when compared to VR itself, WebVR is in its earliest stages, but Mozilla is continuing to experiment and attract other developers to it. This is just a preview of Hubs, the company has plans to bring some new avatar systems and tools for developing custom spaces inside it soon.","The socially networked web is frightening enough, but maybe chatting with some friendly robots will ease the tension?

LISA LERER and SUSAN CHIRA,"To those still reeling from the 2016 loss, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mrs. Clintons running mate, had a blunt message: Get over it and use 2017 and 2018 as the evidence that the pathogen has left the body.
Rather than a liability, several Democrats believe that having women run could be a galvanizing force in the presidential race, as it was in the midterms, when female candidates changed the playbook for how women run for office. Many campaigned with their young children and made their personal stories central to their message. They were not afraid to challenge incumbents.
Those campaigns, and the prospect of multiple female candidates, may change how women are treated in the presidential race.
When you have two women running, the question becomes, what are you going to fight for, what do you believe in not what are you going to do with your children, how do you get your hair to stay like that all day, said Representative Katie Porter, who defeated a female Republican incumbent to flip her California congressional seat in November.
Ms. Lake, the Democratic pollster, pointed to womens high turnout rates in primaries, and to their success in championing issues like health care and education, which could continue to resonate in a presidential race. Those topics, along with immigration and income inequality, are likely to form the base of a national message for the nominee.
And she noted that many of the states with early presidential primaries or caucuses have had women as governors or senators, suggesting that those voters had no reluctance about electing women. These include the former Democratic governor of New Hampshire; Democratic senators in New Hampshire, Nevada and California; the current Republican governor of Iowa; and the former governor of South Carolina.
As Democrats prepare for a crowded primary field, there are other considerations that have nothing to do with gender, but rather the partys divisions over ideology and geography. Some are focusing on reversing Electoral College losses in the Midwest and argue a centrist from the region, male or female, might have broader appeal; others believe only progressives can fire up the party base. Senators Harris, Gillibrand and Warren are based on the coasts and have allied themselves with the partys left.","Regardless of whether a woman wins the Democratic nomination in 2020, the presence of new, multiple female faces in the race could help the party move past a set of political expectations for women largely defined by Hillary Clinton for several decades.",2019-01-05T16:54:37Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",‘There’s a Real Tension.’ Democrats Puzzle Over Whether a Woman Will Beat Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/us/politics/women-candidates-president-2020.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/06/us/06femalecandidates-4-promo/06femalecandidates-4-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tension,1
Matt Simon,"The pig looks like any other pig, only it's been wearing a backpack for a week—in the name of science. Just behind its head sits a control box, with a battery and processor, from which runs a cable that enters through the pig’s flank. Once inside, the cable attaches to a very special robot clamped onto the pig's esophagus, the pathway to the stomach. Little by little, the robot lengthens, in turn lengthening the tube. The robot attached to a segment of esophagus. This pig doesn’t necessarily need a robot tugging on its esophagus, but children born with a section of theirs missing, a disorder known as esophageal atresia, may in the near future. What researchers detail today in the journal Science Robotics is how their robot could not only help treat this disorder, but also short bowel syndrome, in which a child loses large portions of the intestines to infection. Implantable robots, then, may help extend organs in the human body—though weirdly not by stretching, like you might assume is going on here. Current treatment for esophageal atresia is not in the least bit simple or pleasant. Surgeons attach sutures to the two ends of the food tube and pull them out through incisions in the child’s back. “They tie these onto what looks like buttons on the kid's back,” says Boston Children's Hospital researcher Pierre Dupont, co-author of the paper. “And they apply tension to those ends in this way.” This lengthens the two disconnected bits of the esophagus, so when the surgeons put them back in the chest and sew them together, they now bridge what was once a gap. Problem is, this lengthening can take up to a month, and the kid has to be sedated the whole time. The sutures are under a lot of tension, and if the patient moves, they could pop out. On top of that, the procedure could really be more precise: Surgeons base how much tension they’re adding on experience. “If they pull too hard they tear out,” says Dupont. “If they don't pull enough the tissue doesn't grow. But they're trying to pull as hard as they can without it tearing because they don't want to have that kid paralyzed and sedated longer than they have to.” Ideally, you could build a more precise system that works within the body, automatically sensing how much tension it needs to apply. Which is where the pig comes in. It isn’t missing a section of its esophagus, so in this experiment the robot—which is attached by way of two rings wrapped around the esophagus and sutured an inch and a half apart—is lengthening to stretch the tube like a rubber band. Except it’s not really stretching, as it happens. “This is what our surgeons knew from experience from looking at the tissue,” says Dupont, “but never had been able to verify."" The tension that comes with the traditional surgical and robotic methods is actually encouraging new tissue to grow. The robot is inducing the esophagus to produce new cells, which leads to healthier tissue than if the tube were just stretched out. The researchers managed to get the length of the pig esophagus to increase by 75 percent in just over a week. Theoretically, in a child with a gap in their esophagus, the robot would still make the esophagus longer—it would just bring two incomplete ends together. Surgeons would suture one ring to the top end of the esophagus and one to the bottom end. Over time, the robot would contract, bringing the two ends closer and closer, inducing those cells to grow. Eventually the gap would close enough that surgeons could stitch the two ends of the tube together, making the esophagus whole. The robot could also potentially treat short bowel syndrome. In this case, surgeons have removed a significant length of infected intestine. “The remaining length is so short, the food goes in one end and it comes out the other end without any chance for absorption of nutrients,” says Dupont. “So if there was a way to induce lengthening of that bowel then those kids wouldn't have to be fed intravenously.” Here the robot would work more like it did in the pig, attaching to the intestine and slowly expanding to lengthen the organ. “This is very intriguing concept that attempts to address therapy for extremely challenging group of patients,” says Nikolay Vasilyev, a researcher who has developed a robot that helps hearts pump. “It remains to be seen how the robot can be safely explanted and how the tissue responds over the longer-term.” The solution there may be degradable materials. “What I'd love to do is make a version of my robot,” says Dupont, “that even though it's placed exterior to the bowel, it would be resorbable, so that all of the components would dissolve away and we wouldn't have to subject the kid to another surgery.” So the body would essentially digest the robot outside of the digestive system. Before that all can happen, though, the researchers will have to shrink down a robot that works on 100-pound pigs into something that’d not only fit 3-month-old humans, but work entirely inside the body. Which doesn’t seem impossible: Robots will only get smaller and more sophisticated from here. And soon enough, machines of all kinds will be making their way into the human body—think robots made of pig intestine that you swallow, for instance. So thanks, pigs, that'll do.","Researchers detail how an implantable robot could tug on organs to lengthen them, a potential treatment for two traumatic childhood disorders.",2018-01-10T19:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",A Robot That Tugs on Pig Organs Could Save Human Babies,https://www.wired.com/story/a-robot-that-tugs-on-pig-organs-could-save-human-babies/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a55675e58ef3a10d30786f2/191:100/pass/pigs-87397515.jpg,wired,Wired,tension,1
Gabe Zichermann,"The president of the United States cannot seem to stop tweeting. Despite stern advice from his advisors and opprobrium from the world, not a day goes by that POTUS doesn’t escalate some tension in 140 280 characters. Each of us can relate to making a social media post we regret later and vowing never to do it again — but few of us do it on such a public scale. However, is it addiction? The answer is surprisingly complex. Technology-based addictions of all kinds are fairly new. Porn, shopping, social media, video game and screen addictions existed, but were rare until the advent of the smartphone. Now, tens of millions of people struggle to put down their devices even though they know better, and billions of us feel our screen-time use is excessive. Despite the huge numbers, the scientific establishment has been very slow to acknowledge these so-called “behavioral addictions.” Only gambling is a recognized form of addiction in the American Psychology Association’s disorder bible, the DSM… so it might take a while before Twitter Response Dependence Disorder is described in the literature. While there may be no consensus on tech addiction as a “thing,” there is no question that many technologies are addictive. Twitter for example, uses concepts from gamification to get and keep people engaged. Each time you tweet and receive a retweet, like or reply, your brain secretes a little bit of dopamine. This is a natural, evolutionary response to reinforcement, and the more you do it, the more you want to do it. Particularly if you have a large following (as @realdonaldtrump does), the intensity, volume and immediacy of reaction in the social graph can be intoxicating. In this instance, more really is more. The desire to stop (or reduce) harmful overuse, but being unable to do so, is one of the traditional hallmarks of addiction. Over the last decade, companies like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat have become masters of behavioral design and gamification. They use sophisticated AI to create habit loops that are designed to get and keep you hooked for as long as possible. I know this intimately, as I’ve been the cheerleader-in-chief for gamification over the past decade, and worked with many of these companies. Today’s consumer tech giants live or die by engagement, and they can — and will — do whatever it takes to get there. But there is hope for tech-life balance. In research for my anti-tech addiction product Onward, we found that chronic tech overusers were completely unable to estimate correctly how much time they spent online (no surprise!). We also found that users who reported feeling anxious were 2.5x more likely to act out in the next 3 hours than users who felt OK. The upshot of these disheartening statistics is that a system designed to consider your time online and predictive states, like Onward does, can be highly effective at reducing compulsive overuse. Specifically, 89 percent of Onward users reduced their usage, and 51 percent stopped completely in our studies. The desire to stop (or reduce) harmful overuse, but being unable to do so, is one of the traditional hallmarks of addiction. Sometimes this is a reflection of someone’s lack of willpower, physical or mental energy, fear of stigmatization and/or hopelessness. Also important, however, in treating overuse is to recognize that if the person doesn’t see it as a problem, it cannot — by definition — be an addiction. Never mind that they are unlikely to seek help or succeed in recovery, but a lack of belief in the problem itself makes it impossible to even reach a diagnostic consensus. We believe that de-escalating the term addiction, and instead using “overuse,” is key. This allows each person to set their own limits and seek help for their issues without having to hit “rock bottom.” That tension between desire, free will and self-harm is crucial in addressing tech-based addictions. Every time someone binge watches Netflix instead of doing their homework, they are — absolutely — making a conscious decision to do so. They derive some pleasure from (or lack thereof) choosing Stranger Things over Statistics. An argument can be made that Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and the like are deceiving users and pushing negative behaviors despite evidence of harm. Some have even made the comparison to big tobacco. But there is no cover up — just companies designing their products to capture the key economic value they seek — engagement. Each person has to find (and define) their own red lines and tech-life balance. And therein lies the rub. While POTUS’s tweets may be negative and consequential, unless he thinks he has a problem, there is no basis for asserting pathology. Like the majority of the population who feel uncomfortable with their screen time (but keep doing it anyway), he might sometimes be uncomfortable or regretful later, but the behavior is authentic, consciously done and positively reinforced (in his view). Of course, Twitter also benefits from his regular use of the platform, and so has little incentive to throttle access — no matter what the consequences. Everything in moderation, as the famous saying goes. Each person has to find (and define) their own red lines and tech-life balance. Collectively, however, there is mounting evidence we are overusing our screens, and research suggests it’s making people unhappy. I believe we can be happier without having to give up the power of new, social technologies — but we have to want things to be different. Of course, if @realdonaldtrump — or anyone — sincerely decides they want to change their social media habit, we’ll be there.","The president of the United States cannot seem to stop tweeting.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Does it matter who's in charge of Turkey? Three people are dead and eight wounded in southern Turkey, after election campaigning descended into violence. The incident has heightened tensions ahead of the 24 June vote, in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is aiming for a second term. The clash broke out in the mainly Kurdish town of Suruc, when an MP from the ruling AKP, Ibrahim Halil Yildiz, was touring some shops. Pro-government and pro-Kurdish accounts of the incident differ significantly. The state-run Anadolu news agency reports that Kurdish militant shopkeepers attacked the MP's entourage, and says his brother is among the dead. It says supporters of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) were involved in the bloodshed. But opposition sources say the politician's bodyguards opened fire when he received a hostile reception. Eight people were taken to hospital and police made 10 arrests, security sources say. Why is the vote so tense? The presidential and parliamentary elections are expected to be close run. Mr Erdogan could be forced into a run-off and the AKP (the Justice and Development Party) may lose its majority in parliament.

If his party exceeds the 10% vote threshold required to enter Turkey's parliament, that could jeopardise Mr Erdogan's chances of a majority. Speaking about the bloodshed on Thursday, HDP co-leader Pervin Buldan condemned the killings and added: ""We see that some are trying to incite the people with provocations."" Mr Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin condemned the ""hideous attack"" on Twitter. Read more on Turkey and the election campaign here: What is Erdogan's strategy? BBC Turkey Correspondent Mark Lowen reports that the violence on Thursday came after a video leaked on social media purported to show President Erdogan advocating the intimidation of Kurds to win more votes. The video shows the president telling party officials that they should focus on the HDP. He then tells them that they have the voter lists of each neighbourhood, and should do what is necessary. He adds that if AKP officials arrive at polling stations before the other parties, in his words, ""it can end before it even begins"".

Tom McKay,"After months of tension over what, if anything, the Securities and Exchange Commission was planning to do about cryptocurrencies and the billions of dollars people have sunk into initial coin offerings—a form of barely regulated investment vehicle in which investors trade real cash for tokens in crypto-backed startups—the agency’s chairman Jay Clayton has finally weighed in. In a statement posted to the agency’s website on Monday, Clayton alluded to rumors of a cryptocurrency bubble, writing that “We are hearing the familiar refrain, ‘This time is different.’” He went on to caution investors that there is a significant risk that returns may be lower than anticipated or that their money could be stolen, as well as warned market makers that the SEC essentially considers coin offerings to be securities. There is “substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation,” Clayton said. “Investors should understand that to date no initial coin offerings have been registered with the SEC. The SEC also has not to date approved for listing and trading any exchange-traded products (such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies.” “If any person today tells you otherwise, be especially wary.” Clayton contended that the SEC will require most ICOs to follow exactly the same laws as traditional securities, with procedural, disclosure and registration rules being the same. “A change in the structure of a securities offering does not change the fundamental point that when a security is being offered, our securities laws must be followed,” he added. As Forbes noted, Clayton’s statement noted the various the ways in which cryptocurrency could aid capital formation. But he also explicitly called out scammers, shady promoters, and ICOs which seek to dodge securities regulations by claiming they’re offering dual-purpose “utility” tokens, labeling the latter designation just a form of semantics. “Merely calling a token a ‘utility’ token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token from being a security,” Clayton warned. In other words, the SEC is letting the ICO explosion continue instead of enforcing a South Korea or China-style ban, but it will intervene if individual operators fail to follow securities rules or play fast and loose with them. That alone may force somewhat of a cool-off throughout the crypto space, as some of the speculation is being driven by lack of regulation and exactly the kind of tactics Clayton brought up as possible violations of securities laws. The SEC has shut down and filed charges against some of the worst offenders in the space; simultaneously, the Internal Revenue Service is cracking down on potential cryptocurrency-enabled tax fraud by demanding major exchanges hand over customer information. Oversight of the sector is coming as big firms are weighing the possibility of selling cryptocurrency futures, which will increase the exposure of the overall economy to future developments in the crypto space—whether it’s continued boom times or a major crash.

Patrick Howell O'Neill,"The relationship between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon is one of the most high-stakes, high-tension, and high-dollar links in the world. Desperate to lead the globes militaries in artificial intelligence, the U.S. Defense Department is trying to navigate a maze of tech employee protests and political minefields with the hope of getting cozier with American technology giants.
Google executives will meet next week with U.S. General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the nations top general, to discuss Googles artificial intelligence business in China and the companys troubled relationship with the Pentagon, Dunford revealed on Thursday during a live interview at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C.
Dunford has said Googles business is helping China catch up militarily to the United States.
The labyrinthine and opaque relationship between private companies and Chinas government complicates any effort to understand exactly how Beijing impacts or benefits from each firm. Dunford hasnt offered any proof or even much in the way of details for his accusations. Instead, hes joined a chorus of politicians increasingly hostile to the company after Googles 2018 pledge to not develop AI weapons technology, a pledge that first and foremost impacts the Pentagon.
The complicated and at times cold relationship between the Pentagon and Google has put a spotlight on how the Defense Department and Silicon Valley doand at times do notdo business. Last year, in the most high-profile split yet, protesting Google employees moved the company to drop Project Maven, a drone AI imaging program. Googles work on Project Maven was first made public by Gizmodo in March 2018.
Google isnt the only American tech giant working on AI in China. Both Microsoft and Amazon have AI centers in China. The difference, it seems, is that both Microsoft and Amazon have never had a high-profile split from the Pentagon and have no pledge comparable to Googles. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, for example, defended the companys Pentagon business in the face of employee protests.
Google continues to work with the U.S. government, including the Pentagon, on AI projects, according to a Google spokesperson. The chief difference now is that the projects dont involve developing AI weapons technology, a core focus of the Defense Departments AI push.
Last week, Dunford testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee that Googles AI business in China provided a direct benefit to the Chinese military. President Donald Trump tweeted much the same criticism last week, except he managed to make it about himself.
In my judgment, us assisting the Chinese military in advancing technologically is not in U.S. national interests, Dunford said at the Atlantic Council. And so its a debate we have to have.
Dunford insisted that the debate he was talking about extended far beyond Google to the whole of Silicon Valley and any American technology company doing business in China.
Pointing to Chinas ongoing brutal crackdown and surveillance of the Uighur minority, the American general argued that artificial intelligence and cutting edge technology, in general, is leveraged by the Chinese Communist Party to exert dominance and repression over much the country.
Google offered a small push back last week when a spokesperson argued the company isnt working with the Chinese military. When reached for questions by Gizmodo on Friday, Google did not offer confirmation of the upcoming meeting or details about who would attend.
Last week, the company also said it was working directly with the Pentagon on areas including cybersecurity, recruiting and healthcare.
The work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military, Dunford testified before U.S. lawmakers last week. Indirect may not be a full characterization of the way it is. Its more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.
Last week, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, head of a new Defense Department artificial intelligence center, told Congress that in China the technology that is developed in the civilian world transfers to the military world. Its a direct pipeline. Not only is there a transfer, theres also systemic theft of U.S. technology that also facilitates even faster development of emerging technology.
In a statement to the Associated Press, Google said its AI business in China is focused on education, research on natural language understanding and market algorithms, and development of globally available tools.
Pentagon funding for artificial intelligence will double in an upcoming budget proposal, Shanahan said. The Pentagons recently established Joint Artificial Intelligence Center is slated to increase from $89 million in 2019 to $414 million in 2020, according to Pentagon budget requests.
Googles ambitions in China are no secret, although maybe theyd like them to be. The company experienced a loud backlash when early plans to build a censored search engine in China were leaked. The company then pledged to abandon the Chinese search project.
Googles business in China has been limited since 2014 when the company pulled out most products from the country in a fight over censorship. Googles Android operating system remains the most popular mobile operating system in the world, including in China.

Andrew Liszewski,"Hello. My name is Andrew Liszewski, and Im an incessant finger tapper. Almost anything in reach can become an impromptu drum kit when Im burning off nervous tension. Its often incredibly annoying to those unfortunate enough to be in earshot, but soon my anxious behaviors could yield a future hit on the club scene with Spheros color-sensing SpecDrums toy.
Last month, Sphero, known for its rolling BB-8 toy that was an incredibly popular and hard to find holiday item when Star Wars: The Force Awakens originally hit theaters, revealed that it was officially calling it quits on licensed toys. Sales of those bots, like its brilliant interactive R2-D2, all but dried up once the movies they were tied to left theaters, leaving the company with lots of unsold stock it recently cleared out. As first revealed back in January of 2018, the decision was part of a larger initiative for the company to refocus on its educational roots, which resulted in a smarter version of Spheros Bolt robotic ball being released in September, and an acquisition of a smaller company called Specdrums back in June.
The idea behind the SpecDrums is a simple one, powered by an even simpler device worn on a finger, or multiple digits. It looks like an oversized, upside-down class ring made of flexible silicone, but packed with an optical sensor, LED, and a battery, instead of semi-precious gemstones. Its essentially a compact MIDI device that triggers an accompanying mobile app to play sounds based on a given color being detected.
The SpecDrum starter kit includes a rollable play pad featuring a series of colorful keys that can be played.
GIF: Gizmodo (Andrew Liszewski)
To ensure colors are detected accurately, the SpecDrum wearable uses a neutral white LED light thats only triggered when an accelerometer detects a physical tap, illuminating what the rings sensor is seeing. In the GIF above, you can see its brief afterglow as I repeatedly tap on an included rollable play pad that serves as a simple eight-key piano. But the real appeal of the SpecDrum wearable is that it can detect the color of almost any object that can be physically tapped, and trigger a responselike a sound, a sample, or a beatand potentially other outcomes as well.
1 / 4
Ahead of CES 2019 we had the opportunity to try out a finalized version of the SpecDrums hardware, but only an early-access version of the accompanying mobile app. It functions like a synthesizer, allowing you to play sounds, beats, or sound effects using the SpecDrum wearable (or by just tapping your devices screen) with a limited amount of additional functionality that hints at where Sphero plans to take the toy.
You can change the apps default trigger colors to almost anything by simply tapping the SpecDrum sensor on a real-world object, and even custom record your own sounds to be played. The app also currently includes a small library of sound collections that can be downloaded and performed, which Sphero will undoubtedly expand once the toy is officially available. Theres even the option to record a performance, and hopefully, Sphero will eventually allow users to share sound collections online (assuming proper recording laws are followed) similar to how the company lets its users swap and trade custom programs with its other STEM-based toys.
Will we soon see DJs in the club tapping their way through a set with SpecDrums sensors on every finger? Probably not. While the wearable is very responsiveit genuinely feels like youre playing a tangible instrumentit will occasionally not register a tap if the sensor hasnt made proper contact with an object or a surface.
Spheros SpecDrums: Another good reason to buy more fruit.
GIF: Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo)
For example, reliably getting a musical response when tapping on an orange that could roll around required some practice, and even then the app had a hard time distinguishing the fruits color from the orange panel on the play pad. The sensor the wearable uses, which Sphero promises can detect thousands of colors, doesnt have anywhere near the same color fidelity as the ones used in digital cameras. But with a price tag of $65 (or $99 for a pair of rings) thats not terribly surprising. The SpecDrums kit isnt a tool for professional musicians, its a toy for aspiring musicians that want to further inspire their musical experimentation. And as an admitted fidgeter, its already succeeded in holding my interest longer than a spinner.

Jennifer Ouellette,"Enlarge / Geico's sophisticated gecko opts for a speedboat, but if he wanted, he could totally run across the water. 3 with 3 posters participating Geckos are known for being expert climbers, able to stick to any surface thanks to the billions of tiny hair-like structures on the bottoms of their feet. Now it turns out the little lizards can also zip along the surface of water at high speeds to elude predators. They can't do it for very long; the energy expenditure required is too great. But it's amazing they can do it at all. Scientists think they've pinpointed the mechanisms behind the feat, described in a new paper in Cell Biology. The project started when co-author Ardian Jusufi, then a postdoc in the lab of University of California, Berkeley biophysicist Robert Full, was on vacation in Singapore during monsoon season. One day, after a big rain storm, he caught a gecko skimming across the water to escape a predator on video. The footage astounded everyone in the lab when he showed it to them. ""It was super weird and unexpected, so naturally we had to test this,"" says co-author Jasmine Nirody, another former Full student who now splits her time between Rockefeller University and the University of Oxford. There are several creatures in nature capable of walking on water, but they employ different mechanisms depending on their size. Small, lightweight water striders, for instance, rely entirely on surface tension to stay afloat, while the larger, heavier basilisk lizards employ a slapping motion with their feet that creates pockets of air bubbles to keep from sinking. The standard theoretical calculations set very strict boundaries for how small an animal has to be to use surface tension and how large it needs to be before the surface slapping mechanism is viable. Enlarge / The unique gait of the gecko on water as captured on camera. Geckos fall somewhere in between. They are too large to rely solely on surface tension and too small to generate sufficient force to run along the surface of water without sinking. And yet they can still somehow accomplish the feat at lightning speedalmost one meter per second. That's why Full's team decided to investigate further. They used laser cutters to create entry and exit holes in a large plastic box to make a water tank and then built two wooden ramps so their group of Asian house geckos ( Hemidactylus platyurus ) could enter and exit the water easily. A pair of high-speed cameras were placed above and to the side at right angles to capture the movement. The geckos would be placed on the entry ramp, and team members would lightly touch their tails to startle them into swimming away. Geckos have developed a set of complicated mechanisms all their own for walking on water. It turns out that geckos have developed a set of complicated mechanisms all their own for walking on water. There are two objectives when skimming across water: keeping one's body above the surface, and forward propulsion. For the first, the gecko combines surface slapping and surface tension, aided by their unique hydrophobic skin that repels water, according to Nirody. A water droplet will just sit on top of a gecko's skin. Lifting their bodies above the water reduces drag, making it easier for geckos to propel themselves forward than if they were fully immersed. They also employ a wriggling motion with their bodies and tails, much like swimming. ""If you look at them from the top, it almost looks like they're just swimming really fast,"" says Nirody. ""And then you look at them from the side and you realize their upper body and their legs are completely out of the water, even though they're still doing the swimming motion that helps propel them forward."" To verify that surface tension did indeed play a role in the gecko's surface skimming ability, the researchers added a surfactant (dish soap) to the water. Surface tension occurs because water molecules tend to stick to each other (molecular adhesion), forming a kind of supportive film to keep very light creatures afloat. Adding soap causes the molecules to lose that stickiness. Put a water strider into soapy water and it will sink because it relies entirely on surface tension. But a basilisk lizard is unaffected since it relies entirely on the surface slapping. Movements of the gecko's forelimbs and hindlimbs are similar to running gaits on land. Geckos combine limb movement with body and tail undulation. Once again, the geckos fall somewhere in between. They didn't sink, but Nirody et al. found that adding soap to the water reduced the geckos' speed by half, most likely because their bodies were much lower in the water because of the decreased surface tension. ""We knew they couldn't maintain their entire body weight by slapping alone from the theoretical calculations,"" said Nirody. This test proved it. The geckos did exhibit some interesting reactions to the soapy water. Roughly half would redouble their efforts to swim as fast as possible, even though their speed was severely limited. The other half, after the first few strokes, simply gave up and planked, sinking to the bottom. Geckos can hold their breath for several minutes, so they weren't in any immediate danger, although the team members rescued them after about 30 seconds. ""We hypothesized that if they can't dart away in time, rather than slowly skimming from a predator, it's best for them to just hide under the water and hold their breath"" says Nirody. One of the goals of this research is to improve the design of bio-inspired robots. The authors note that modeling a robot on the basilisk lizard would work, but it would require a lot of energy and some kind of active stabilization for it to really be functional. An undulating tail similar to the gecko's might help with the latter issue and strengthen forward propulsion, while coating the robot with a hydrophobic material similar to the gecko's skin structure could significantly reduce drag. ""Nature has so much to teach us,"" says Nirody. ""It's built all these amazing machines to look at and learn from."" Courtesy University of Oxford.

George Dvorsky,"Bird parents, like many human mothers and fathers, often struggle to become empty nesters. But as new research suggests, the tension that arises between baby birds who don’t want to leave the nest and parents who would very much like them out ultimately results in an ideal departure time that boosts survival rates. Every bird you see outside your window is a survivor. The war of attrition that is evolution guarantees that only the fittest survive, but often at tremendous cost. In juvenile birds, for example, mortality rates during the first three weeks outside the nest range from between 12 percent to an astounding 70 percent, depending on the species. Needless to say, baby birds need to to leave their nests at the right stage of development to boost their chances of making it to adulthood. New research published today in Science Advances shows that, for several species of songbirds, staying in the nest for extended periods allows baby birds to develop wings that are better suited for flight, which ultimately helps them to survive outside the nest. At the same time, however, parents would rather see an earlier departure. Surprisingly, this previously undocumented tension actually results in a leave-taking that Goldilocks herself would be proud of—an exit time that’s not too early or too late, according to University of Montana researcher Thomas E. Martin, author of the new study. For songbird nestlings on the cusp of fledglinghood, it’s a kind of damned-if-you-do, damned-if you-don’t situation. If a baby bird leaves the nest too early, when its wings aren’t yet fully developed, it’s at greater risk of being caught by predators. But the nest itself isn’t always a safe space, as it’s vulnerable to squirrels, chipmunks, jay birds, and snakes. At the same time, evolutionary “success” holds a different meaning to the fledglings than it does to the parents. For the fledgling, success is measured by pure survival outside of the nest, but for the parents, it’s the guarantee that at least one of their brood survives. Hence the desire among songbird parents to get their chicks out into the real world as fast as possible, since when a predator attacks a nest, it typically kills the entire brood, and none of the parent’s genetic material get passed down to the next generation. But fledglings who have left the nest are spread out and mobile, dealing with life on their own terms, and independently fending for themselves. To facilitate departure, parents hold food away from the nest and encourage their young to come and get it. But mom and dad are not in total control—the youngsters are also capable of manipulation, and their incessant begging often causes the parents to cave. “Thus, offspring fledge [i.e. leave the nest] at an age that is later than optimal from the parents’ perspective and earlier than optimal from an offspring’s perspective, yielding a compromise between parents and offspring that balances risk of mortality in versus out of the nest,” write the researchers in the study. To show that it’s advantageous for baby birds to stay in the nest for longer periods of time (at least as far as wing development is concerned), Martin and his colleagues used high-speed video to compare falling golf balls to wild birds making their first flights. Sound silly, but this allowed the researchers to measure the rate at which an inanimate object falls compared to a bird trying to fly for the very first time. In terms of performance, the researchers were looking at the birds’ ability to slow their descent, or fly in a sustainable manner. Eleven different species of songbirds were studied, including mountain chickadees, western blue birds, house wrens, and the white-breasted nuthatch. The researchers also accounted for the age of the birds at first departure, and variations in wing growth rates. Gray-headed juncos leave the nest at a young age because their ground nests are at high risk of predation. This young age of departure results in under-developed wings that do not allow sustained flight, even the day after they left the nest, as this footage demonstrates. GIF: T. E. Martin/Gizmodo Radio transmitters were placed on eight species of the songbirds to see if they were still alive seven days after leaving the nest. The researchers also studied the rate at which baby birds were killed in the nest, in order to determine if birds were truly leaving at an optimal time. And in a side experiment, the researchers delayed the expected departure time in some birds by holding them back for three days to see how’d they fare when their wings were more fully developed. The results were not entirely surprising. The poorer the flight performance exhibited by a bird, the greater chance it had of being killed by a predator. What’s more, poor flight performance was tied to younger fledging ages. Results from the side experiment further corroborated these findings. What’s more, the data also showed that the push-and-pull between nestlings and their parents resulted in an optimal departure time that minimized mortality. These results only apply to the eight songbird species studied, so more research could show whether the same principle applies to other species. “In addition, fledgling survival was only measured for the first week after leaving the nest, and ramifications of differences in development at fledging may yield different results on survival over the longer term, such that study of survival for a longer period after leaving the nest would be useful,” Martin told Gizmodo. Natural selection doesn’t care how a solution is reached—if a survival strategy works, it will get passed down. In this case, irritated parents dealing with angsty youngsters produces a result that’s beneficial for the species as a whole.

As one of the sources put it: ""What does it mean if your name is not on the letter?"" Vester's attorney, Ari Wilkenfeld, had no new comment on Saturday. On Friday he said Vester spoke out because she feels ""NBC needs to prioritize actually listening to and protecting their employees who have been victimized."" Vester was a young reporter at NBC in the early 1990s when, she says, Brokaw ""groped and assaulted"" her. Brokaw angrily denied the claims in a letter to colleagues on Friday. The letter was subsequently published by news outlets. He called Vester a ""character assassin"" with a ""grudge against NBC News."" Tom Brokaw rails against sexual harassment allegations ""She has unleashed a torrent of unsubstantiated criticism and attacks on me more than twenty years after I opened the door for her and a new job at Fox News,"" Brokaw's wrote. He added that he played a key role in introducing Vester to former Fox News boss Roger Ailes, who later hired her. Ailes, who died in 2017, left the network amid sexual harassment allegations. NBC News had no comment on Saturday about the supportive letter. Vester left the TV news business in 2006. She told The Washington Post Thursday that she chose to speak out now ""because NBC has failed to hire outside counsel to investigate a genuine, long-standing problem of sexual misconduct in the news division.""

Most resistance band stretches are variations on things you can do without a resistance band, so you can follow along even if all you have is a yoga strap or a towel. What the resistance band adds is adjustable tension, so you can judge in the moment whether youd like to stretch a little deeper or ease up and be more gentle. Remember, you dont need to be in pain to benefit from a stretch. 
Here are a few basic stretches you can do with any resistance band thats long enough. Im using the kind thats like a tube with handles, but these work just as well with the loop type. 
The shoulder warm-up
This is a great stretching/strengthening combo move to get you ready for any kind of shoulder exercise, or you can use it to work on shoulder flexibility at the end of a workout. Just stretch the band in front of you, and pass it over your head and back down to waist level while your arms are straight. Adjust your tension to get more or less of a stretch.
The hamstring stretch
Loop the band over your foot, and gently pull your leg skyward. You can hold the stretch here, or move into and out of position.
Adductor and abductor stretches
With your band still on your foot, extend your straight leg out to the side to stretch your inner thigh muscles. Then take your leg to the other side of your body to stretch the muscles on the outside of your hip.
There are tons of resistance band stretchesthese are just my personal favorites.

Rodrigo Campos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major stock markets slipped on Monday as rising tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia added to concerns over the pace of global economic growth, with investors flocking to traditional safe-havens like the Japanese and Swiss currencies, as well as gold. Oil prices rose as the Saudi-West rift more than offset concerns over slowing demand for oil in the long term. The yen JPY= touched a one-month high versus the greenback and the Swiss franc CHF= rose for the fourth session in five while gold XAU= hit its highest since late July. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman on Monday ordered an internal probe into the unexplained disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi as a joint Turkish-Saudi team was expected at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where the journalist and dissident was last seen on Oct. 2. The kingdom is preparing a report that would admit Khashoggi was killed as the result of an interrogation that went wrong, CNN reported, citing two unnamed sources. Turkish police have audio showing Khashoggi was killed at the consulate, sources told Reuters. Over the weekend, prominent business people including JPMorgan’s ( JPM.N ) CEO Jamie Dimon and Ford ( F.N ) Chairman Bill Ford canceled plans to attend an investor conference this month in Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter. U.S. crude CLc1 rose 0.48 percent to $71.68 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $80.76, up 0.41 percent on the day. “If the Saudis don’t come to the rescue when the Iranian sanctions kick in... it’s going to be a very under-supplied market. That was the fear that was initially driving prices higher,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. On Wall Street, major indexes were mixed, with defensive sector stocks rising after soft retail sales data. Apple ( AAPL.O ) was among the largest drags after a warning from Goldman Sachs regarding overall consumer demand from China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average.DJI fell 89.44 points, or 0.35 percent, to 25,250.55, the S&amp;P 500.SPX lost 16.34 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,750.79 and the Nasdaq Composite.IXIC dropped 66.15 points, or 0.88 percent, to 7,430.74.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan.MIAPJ0000PUS closed 1.11 percent lower. Japan's Nikkei.N225 slumped 1.9 percent. Washington said it would seek a provision about currency manipulation in future trade deals with Japan. DOLLAR WEAKENS The dollar softened against major currencies after the weak U.S. retail sales data for September while Treasury yields were little changed after hitting last week their highest level in over seven years. The euro EUR= rose 0.14 percent to $1.1578. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.37 percent versus the greenback at 111.78 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3151, down 0.02 percent on the day. The Swiss franc rose 0.47 percent versus the greenback at 0.9866 per dollar. Turkey's lira TRYTOM=D4 jumped 1.6 percent to its strongest since mid-August after Trump cheered the release of a U.S. pastor who had been under house arrest in Turkey. Investors hope his release can lead to an improvement in strained U.S.-Turkey relations.

Phil Stewart,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. withdrawal from a Cold War-era nuclear arms treaty with Russia could give the Pentagon new options to counter Chinese missile advances but experts warn the ensuing arms race could greatly escalate tensions in the Asia-Pacific. U.S. officials have been warning for years that the United States was being put at a disadvantage by China’s development of increasingly sophisticated land-based missile forces, which the Pentagon could not match thanks to the U.S. treaty with Russia. President Donald Trump has signaled he may soon give the Pentagon a freer hand to confront those advances, if he makes good on threats to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which required elimination of short- and intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles. Dan Blumenthal, a former Pentagon official now at the American Enterprise Institute, said a treaty pullout could pave the way for the United States to field easier-to-hide, road-mobile conventional missiles in places like Guam and Japan. That would make it harder for China to consider a conventional first strike against U.S. ships and bases in the region. It could also force Beijing into a costly arms race, forcing China to spend more on missile defenses. “It will change the picture fundamentally,” Blumenthal said. Even as Trump has blamed Russian violations of the treaty for his decision, he has also pointed a finger at China. Beijing was not party to the INF treaty and has been fielding new and more deadly missile forces. These include China’s DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which has a maximum range of 4,000 km (2,500 miles) and which the Pentagon says can threaten U.S. land and sea-based forces as far away as the Pacific island of Guam. It was first fielded in 2016. “If Russia is doing it (developing these missiles) and China is doing it and we’re adhering to the agreement, that’s unacceptable,” Trump said on Sunday. John Bolton, White House national security advisor, noted that recent Chinese statements suggest it wanted Washington to stay in the treaty. “And that’s perfectly understandable. If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing,” he told the Echo Moskvy radio station. “Why not have the Americans bound, and the Chinese not bound?” GROWING THREAT U.S. officials have so far relied on other capabilities as a counter-balance to China, like missiles fired from U.S. ships or aircraft. But advocates for a U.S. land-based missile response say that is the best way to deter Chinese use of its muscular land-based missile forces. Kelly Magsamen, who helped craft the Pentagon’s Asian policy under the Obama administration, said China’s ability to work outside of the INF treaty had vexed policymakers in Washington, long before Trump came into office. But she cautioned that any new U.S. policy guiding missile deployments in Asia would need to be carefully coordinated with allies, something that does not appear to have happened yet. Mismanagement of expectations surrounding a U.S. treaty pullout could also unsettle security in the Asia-Pacific, she cautioned. “It’s potentially destabilizing,” she said. Experts warn that China would put pressure on countries in the region to refuse U.S. requests to position missiles there. Abraham Denmark, a former senior Pentagon official under Obama, said Guam, Japan and even Australia were possible locations for U.S. missile deployments. “But there are a lot of alliance questions that appear at first glance to be very tricky,” he cautioned. Still, current and former U.S. officials say Washington is right to focus on China’s missile threat. Harry Harris, who led U.S. military forces in the Pacific before becoming U.S. ambassador to Seoul, said earlier this year that the United States was at a disadvantage. “We have no ground-based (missile) capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence... to the treaty,” Harris told a Senate hearing in March, without calling for the treaty to be scrapped. Asked about Trump’s comments, China’s foreign ministry said a unilateral U.S. withdrawal would have a negative impact and urged the United States to “think thrice before acting.” “Talking about China on the issue of unilaterally pulling out of the treaty is completely mistaken,” spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"An important discrepancy in measurements of the universes acceleration has theorists wondering whether weve gotten something fundamentally wrong in our understanding of the history of the universe. One currently unexplained cosmological mystery is the Hubble tension, where various measurements of the universes expansion seem to disagree. As the story surrounding this tension gets murkier, others have begun to come up with new ideas that could explain it. Beyond the Higgs, we havent discovered anything new, physicist Ane Slosar at Brookhaven National Laboratory told Gizmodo. Any kind of new tension is exciting. We want to see where the new physics will appear. The universe is expanding; the space between galaxies is growing. A constant named after astronomer Edwin Hubble describes how quickly this expansion occurs. Scientists now have several methods for determining the value of Hubbles constant, but these methods have produced two values that dont agree. For some methods, which rely on using the light from supernova and pulsing stars called Cepheid variables to determine their changing distance, it appears that objects move away from the Earth 73 kilometers per second faster for every 3.26 million additional light-years, also called a megaparsec. For other measuring methods, which rely on the electromagnetic radiation that reaches us from the early universe called the cosmic microwave background, the value is around 67 kilometers per second per megaparsec. Experimental errors alone dont seem to explain the discrepant values. Attempts to explain away the difference without new physics dont seem to hold up to scrutiny. Even so, the difference between the values isnt at the five-sigma level of experimental precision required to say that the values are truly discrepant. But the story has gotten murkier. Most recently, a new result from scientists running the Dark Energy Survey has muddied the waters. Using measurements from supernovae, they in fact measured a Hubble constant of 67.7 kilometers per second per megaparsec, closer to the early universe measurement. Though youd think this new measurement closing the gap between the two previous measurements would reduce interest in the problem, two independent teams of theoretical physicists happened to release papers addressing this tension just after the DES result came out. Both propose tweaks to our understanding of the universes early history. One paper reduces the tension between the two values by modifying when the period of recombinationthe era a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang when the first neutral hydrogen atoms began to formbegan and ended. Another introduces early dark energy, some force in charge of driving the universe apart during an earlier time that has since shut off. Physicists already believe there are two phases of the universe expandingone right after the Big Bang when it expanded quickly, called inflation, and the current era. What we are saying is something similar might have happened at another time in the history of the universe, Vivian Poulin from Johns Hopkins University told Gizmodo. Both of the ideas are in their infancytheyve only been posted in the arXiv physics preprint server, meaning that they havent been vetted by peer review. Additionally, both came out too soon after the DES result to cite itand if that work holds, the theorizing might be for naught. Matt Buckley, a Rutgers physicist not involved in either new paper, didnt think that the DES result should cause a reduced interest in the tension, and thought that groups like Poulins and Slosars were certainly asking the right questions. But he mentioned that any new theory must fit all of the existing data. New physics might certainly be the most interesting way to resolve the tension, but there will soon be other new ways to measure the Hubble constant, independent from both the distance ladder that measures closer objects as well as measurements from the most distant radiation. Perhaps gravitational waves, tiny ripples in spacetime that travel at the speed of light and result from chaotic events like colliding black holes, can offer a solution. Scientists would compare the light emanating from colliding neutron stars with their gravitational waves, and have already determined an estimate of the Hubble constant using this method. Reliable measurements of the Hubble constant using colliding neutron stars are probably a decade or so away. The Hubble tension will continue to be the subject of observation, and will continue to tantalize theoretical physicists. Its getting more and more interesting from a theory point of view, to see if there are simple explanations for the tension, said Poulin. The interest is related to how good the experiments have become nowadays, and people are taking this more and more seriously as time goes by.

"Kaitlan Collins, Gloria Borger, Dana Bash and Pamela Brown, CNN","Trump surprised reporters in Kelly's office on Wednesday It was, as one source would later describe, ""a warning shot"" Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with his chief of staff John Kelly -- a sentiment that, according to several sources, crystallized Wednesday evening in the West Wing and echoed previous episodes of tension between the President and a chief of staff. Just hours away from departing Washington for the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump -- already dressed in his overcoat -- stood up from the Resolute Desk, strode out of the Oval Office and made his way to Kelly's office, where he upended an immigration briefing with a room full of reporters for the next 10 minutes. It was, as one source would later describe, ""a warning shot"" from a freewheeling President who has felt more and more undermined by his structured chief of staff. For Oval Office watchers, a familiar film reel is playing on the screen: An irritated president. An outspoken chief of staff. A missed trip. Kelly was in the middle of a story when Trump entered the room, to the surprise of reporters and White House staff. It was a rarity for a President who hardly ever enters staffers' offices. Typically, when someone wants to speak to Trump, they go to him. ""Hello everybody, how's he doing, OK?"" Trump asked Wednesday night, speaking of Kelly. ""I think by the way he's doing great. He's doing great. Fake news yesterday, or two days ago. I rarely put out a tweet, praising somebody, but only when they get a false story."" The impromptu press conference set off a scramble inside the White House press shop, with staffers were left wondering: ""What just happened? What do we do? What did he say? And was it on the record?"" Though White House staffers insisted to CNN that he coordinated his drop by with Kelly beforehand, Trump, already frustrated with the idea that Kelly is managing him, put him ""in a box"" once the briefing ended, according to a source familiar with the interaction. Trump then boarded Air Force One for the 9-hour flight to Davos, while Kelly remained behind in Washington to work on immigration reform. The flare-up was just the latest episode that highlights how the relationship between the two has evolved since Kelly was brought in to replace Reince Priebus last July. Trump has been privately annoyed with Kelly since his interview on Fox News last week when he said Trump had ""evolved in the way he's looked at things."" The interview set Trump off -- he ""hated"" his comments, one person familiar with his mood told CNN, and spent the evening calling friends and allies to complain about it. Trump later insisted that his relationship with his chief of staff is fine. Sources who are close to the President say he feels Kelly doesn't respect him, and only pays him lip service. Aides have privately wondered about how dismissive of Trump Kelly is when he is out of earshot, noting that Kelly has told colleagues he is incredibly media savvy and has bragged about the positive coverage he received when he worked for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Kelly has been extremely careful to avoid giving the impression that he is somehow managing Trump -- which people close to him say is a conscious effort. Trump's frustration with Kelly is evident, but some sources caution that talk of discord is planted by Trump loyalists who have seen their access to the President dwindle in light of Kelly's strict policies. Two of his harshest measures -- screening all of the President's incoming calls on the White House switchboard and denying those outside the administration access to the White House grounds -- have irked associates who work in the private sector and rely on their ability to boast about access to the President. Though Trump insists his relationship with his chief of staff is fine, some wonder if Kelly could face a similar fate to his predecessor. Though Priebus initially accompanied Trump on all of his trips, he stayed behind in Washington more often at the end of his tenure. When Trump flew to Germany for the G20 summit, Priebus stayed behind to work on health care. He was replaced later that month. One source cautions that Kelly staying back could be more about being productive because staffers often find it easier to work when the President is away. But Trump has a growing feeling that Kelly is trying to quietly signal to people outside the White House that he is here to protect the country from him, sources familiar with the President's thinking said. Trump often becomes vexed when staffers are given credit for his accomplishments. Once he sees a staffer as getting out in front of him -- as Kelly did with his remarks on Fox News -- the President gets his back up. Those close to Trump believe the stunt he pulled at the briefing with reporters Wednesday night was ""a warning shot"" to Kelly, meant to serve as a reminder of who is boss. And for some, it signals a sign of things to come. ""This is casebook,"" one source told CNN. ""The man has to eat his own.""","President Donald Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with his chief of staff John Kelly -- a sentiment that, according to several sources, crystallized Wednesday evening in the West Wing and echoed previous episodes of tension between the President and a …",2018-01-26T01:04:51Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Trump at odds with Kelly as a familiar pattern unfolds,https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/25/politics/john-kelly-donald-trump/index.html,http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170731122759-john-kelly-donald-trump-01-31-2017-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,tension,1

Paul Tamayo,"With the spiffy Resident Evil 2 remake right around the corner, I got to thinking about remakes versus remasters. At what point should you just go back and boot up the original?
It can be interesting to see a modern take with new mechanics that retains the original soul of the source material. Then again, how would you know if it retains the soul of the original if you havent played it? You might just end up playing a prettier version of the game with changes that impact it in ways that take away from the original.
Still, as technology advances, remasters and remakes are becoming a trend that we all have to get used to. But what makes a good remaster and when does a game warrant a refresh from the ground up? I sat down with Heather Alexandra to talk about great remakes, as well as the games that should just be preserved and left alone.
Hear us talk about the surprising similarities between Leon Kennedy and Lady Gaga in the video above. Heres an excerpt:
Heather: Maybe its my first real old lady shouts at cloud moment but for me, I dont want the Shadow of the Colossus remaster to be the one thats in the cultural ether. I want that to be a facet of what Shadow of the Colossus is, but I want the original to endure.
Paul: Its interesting because its not an inherent problem specific to video games. We have remakes in Hollywood-
Heather: But its bullshit because we talk about remakes in film and we have a shot-for-shot remake of Psycho. What was the point of that? Which is why I will say, what I do appreciate about remakes is when they do recontextualize and reimagine a gameplay experience.
Paul: I think aboutwelcome to the one show thats going to mention A Star Is Bornbut I think about that movie, where its a remake but its the fifth one and they all do something different that adds something to it. Its not just a shot-for-shot remake.
Heather: So one of the reasons that Shadow of the Colossus made me uncomfortableit just takes this original experience that I think was very pure and very much its own thing and adds all this glossiness to it. I think when you change the aesthetic of a thing so much, it changes the tone of a thing. It can change the implications that people read into it.","With the spiffy Resident Evil 2 remake right around the corner, I got to thinking about remakes versus remasters.

Rhett Allain,"This video shows a battle between samurai with jet packs. Don't get excited—it's fake. How do I know? There are a few obvious signs of fake-itude, starting with the shaking camera. This battle was likely recorded on a hand held phone—and if you went to all the trouble of creating a rocket pack, couldn't you at least get a tripod to record this historic event? Yes, you could. Another piece of damning evidence: the vertical video. Sure, vertical is fine for Snapchat, but this is a rocket-powered samurai battle. If it was real, you'd at least take the time to record like a civilized human and turn the phone to landscape mode. But wait! There is some physics working in our favor here, too. If these are fake flying samurai, they must be suspended on some sort of long cable, attached to a crane or something that can raise and lower them as though they're flying. And in fact, I can even find the length of the cable they are using. Just watch: You can find the length of the cable by looking at how the samurai swing after pushing on each other. Oh sure, you could try to find the radius of curvature for their trajectory as they move, but that wouldn't be too simple. Instead, I am going to assume they are a simple pendulum and look at the period of oscillation. I should point out the that the ""simple pendulum"" isn't actually so simple to solve but I can give you the highlights of this physics problem. In order to qualify for the certified ""simple pendulum"" label, the string must be massless and all the mass of the object must be concentrated at the end. Also, the only forces acting on the mass (that's the bob of the pendulum) should be the tension in the string and the gravitational force (no air drag). Of course both of these won't be exactly true for the swinging samurai—but it's close enough. The tension in the string prevents the mass (or samurai) from getting farther away from the pivot point and forces the motion into a circular trajectory. The gravitational force has a component that always pulls the mass back towards the center (equilibrium). If the swinging angle is sufficiently small (we usually say less than 15°) then the swinging mass will exhibit simple harmonic motion just like a mass on a spring. However, the period of oscillation for a mass on a spring depends on the mass and spring stiffness. In the case of a simple pendulum, the period depends on the length of the string and gravitational field (g) based on the following equation. Yes, the T represents the period of oscillation in seconds. L represents the length of the pendulum string in meters and g is the gravitational field with a value of 9.8 Newtons/kg—at least on the surface of the Earth (a different planet could have a different value of g). This means that I just need to find the period of oscillation in order to find the length of the cable. Now for some quick video analysis (I like to use Tracker Video Analysis ). Just looking at the motion of one of the samurai after a push, I get the following plot. This is approximately half of a complete oscillation with a time of about 3.5 seconds. With a full period of 7 seconds, I can solve the above equation for the length. This gives a cable length of 12.2 meters (which is almost exactly 40 feet). Boom. That's how you make a fake samurai jet pack—get a 40 feet long cable and lift him up.","Quality is one sign of a video hoax, but physics gives you indisputable evidence.",2018-04-03T14:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",The Physics Behind a Fake Flying Samurai Battle,https://www.wired.com/story/the-physics-behind-a-fake-flying-samurai-battle/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ac2b6930810d969021d9e5e/191:100/pass/samuraiswords-92030876.jpg,wired,Wired,tension,1

Ryan Flanagan,"Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland is urging India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint as tensions over the disputed Kashmir region mount.
Freeland issued a statement Wednesday afternoon calling on both countries to avoid any further military escalation following Pakistans shooting down of two Indian military aircraft in response to Indian airstrikes.
Canada is gravely concerned about rising tensions between India and Pakistan, Freeland said.
Dialogue is needed to identify a durable diplomatic solution and maintain peace and security in the region.
Pakistans military said Wednesday that it had shot down two Indian planes in its airspace and taken one pilot into custody. The attack came one day after Indian fighter jets conducted an airstrike in Pakistan.
Hostilities between the two countries have been increasing since a suicide attack in Kashmir killed more than 40 Indian soldiers earlier this month. Indias airstrikes this week represented the countrys first attack inside Pakistan since 1971.
Kashmir is a mountainous region on the border of India and Pakistan, both of which have claimed ownership of it for decades.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan called Wednesday for peace talks between the two nations.
The Indian governments response to Wednesdays developments has been to say that one of its planes was lost with its pilot missing in action. India has also claimed that it shot down an aircraft from Pakistan, which Pakistan has denied.
Air Canada suspends flights
The escalating hostilities have also affected travel around the Indian subcontinent.
Pakistan announced Wednesday that it had closed its airspace to commercial traffic, making it difficult for flights from the West to get to India.
An Air Canada spokesperson confirmed to CTV News that one flight from Toronto to Delhi had been directed to return to Canada, while a flight from Vancouver to Delhi had cancelled.
Online flight trackers showed that the flight from Toronto had been near the Norway-Sweden border when it turned around and returned to North America.
The spokesperson said Air Canada would resume service to India once the situation normalizes and we determine it is safe to do so.
In addition to the daily flights to Delhi, Air Canada runs four flights a week from Toronto to Mumbai.
The airline said later in the day that Wednesday nights flight to Mumbai would proceed on an altered route. No decisions had been made about the next departures to Delhi.","Canada 'gravely concerned' about India-Pakistan tension: Freeland CTV News 'Extremely dangerous': Pakistan claims it shot down 2 Indian planes, captured pilot CBC.ca Pakistan says it downed 2 Indian warplanes, captured pilot CBC.ca For Kashmir, there is only …",2019-02-27T15:56:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ctvnews.ca'}",Canada 'gravely concerned' about India-Pakistan tension: Freeland - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-gravely-concerned-about-india-pakistan-tension-freeland-1.4314888,https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4315332.1551296010!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,,Ctvnews.ca,tension,1

"Carsten Lund Pedersen, Thomas Ritter","Azri Suratmin/Getty Images After expending considerable effort on formulating a strategy, most executives would like to see their company’s strategic plans fully executed. Deviations from the strategic plan are often assumed to be detrimental to corporate performance. However, compliance with the strategy doesn’t necessarily correlate directly to performance. The gap between strategy and the execution of that strategy is often referred to as “ strategic dissonance.” We like to call it “strategic stress.” The “ Yerkes-Dodson Law,” which has been used in research that examines the relationship between stress and individual performance, shows that stress increases performance up to a certain point, but not beyond that point. In a similar vein, “strategic stress” can improve your company’s performance – up until a point. Strategic stress is characterized by three zones, which executives must consider and effectively manage: Strategic Burnout (too much strategic stress). Excessive strategic stress is typically a result of one or more of the following causes: (1) Too much autonomy, i.e. employees that follow their own agendas at the expense of corporate alignment (2) unrealistic strategic plans, i.e. the organization is not able to live up to the plans put forth by top management, and (3) market dynamics, i.e. external developments that push the organization in other directions than what was initially planned. When strategy execution moves too far away from the initial strategy, the link between the plan and reality is broken, resources are wasted, and the organization lacks guidance. This scenario is characterized by many divergent projects, fragmented activities that have little in common with the initial strategic plan, and projects that do not fit together. The outcomes of such anarchy are random and, as such, unpredictable. Such organizations experience strategic burnout. Strategic burnout can occur if prophets and experts (that is, employees who enthusiastically work on projects outside the predefined strategy) dominate the organization without the counterweight of executors and gamblers, who drive projects related to the planned strategy (here, executors implement low-risk strategic projects, and gamblers bet on high-risk projects that are within the confines of the predefined strategy). Insight center The Gap Between Strategy and Execution Sponsored by the Brightline Initiative Aligning the big picture with the day-to-day. An example of strategic burnout can be found at Lego around 2004. The company had expanded into too many different and overly complex projects, which essentially created high levels of strategic stress. The multitude of projects drove the company in numerous directions at the same time. The resulting complexity was an underlying cause of the company’s strategic burnout. A turnaround subsequently lowered strategic stress to a productive level by discontinuing many of their seemingly unrelated projects, re-focusing on their core business, as well as streamlining operational processes that improved coordination activities. Strategic Boredom (not enough strategic stress). When strategy execution aligns perfectly with initial plans, the organization does not experience sufficient strategic stress. This results in strategic boredom. The concept of strategic boredom does not necessarily suggest that the content of the strategy is boring, but that the conformity and limited challenges give rise to the risk of strategic complacency, which may result in rigid execution that is blind to emerging risks or opportunities. Strategic boredom can occur if executors and gamblers dominate the organization without the counterweight of prophets and experts who push for new ways to drive the business. An example of strategic boredom is illustrated in Clayton Christensen’s famous work on the disk-drive industry. Leading disk-drive manufacturers found it nearly impossible to maintain their success when the technology and market structure began to change. In other words, their previous success meant that employees failed to challenge the once-successful strategy—that strategy was instead challenged by new market entrants. Strategic Sweet Spot (just the right amount of strategic stress). When strategy execution differs moderately from the initial plan, the organization is in the strategic sweet spot. This scenario is characterized by a sufficient balance between alignment and nonconformity, which is needed to ensure strategic success. The sweet spot can be reached if there is a balance among the four project-manager types: executors, experts, gamblers, and prophets. The optimal amount of each will depend on the specific organization and the situation, and on changes in technologies, customer needs, and the competitive context. An example of the strategic sweet spot is documented in Gary Hamel ’s study of a gang of unlikely rebels who woke IBM up in time to catch the internet wave. Certain project leaders at IBM started an initiative to build a community of web fans, i.e. early adopters of the web, that would subsequently transform the company. The group developed an internal “Get Connected” manifesto that helped guide and leverage the web at IBM. Moreover, a variety of popular, public websites for sports events were developed to illustrate the potential of the novel technological development. The strategic stress generated by these employees was enough to change the organization while not moving it too far away from its original strategic domain. What can you as a leader do to ensure that your strategy is experiencing just the right amount of stress? We suggest the following: Adopt a mindset for stress: Make sure that you do not view strategic stress as a problem from the outset—you want your strategy to be subjected to some stress. Therefore, emphasize the value of both challenging and executing the strategy when communicating with your employees. Set up for stress: Proactively think about how emerging autonomous projects can influence your strategy and its execution. Build structures and processes in the organization such as hackathons and innovation days that provide one-day bursts of autonomy to enable employees to experiment with alternative projects. By providing a clearly limited space for employee autonomy, you ensure that you won’t step into the “too many different projects” pitfall, potentially leading to a strategic burnout. Diversify for stress: Employ a mix of people so that your organization can carry out different projects, some of which focus on executing the strategic plan and others that challenge that plan. Strategy making involves both the deliberate execution of intentional plans and responsive actions to emerging issues. Both activities are necessary to ensure strategic success and corporate longevity. Therefore, your strategy needs a level of stress that requires you to cope with the gap between the plan and its execution. Too much stress to your strategy can be detrimental; but a sufficient amount of strategic stress ensures that your organization moves forward efficiently, and keeps you alert and responsive to emerging developments. Just like a diamond is the valuable outcome of constant pressure from multiple sides, strategic success results from balanced pressure on your strategy.",The benefits of “strategic stress.”,2017-11-24T15:00:29Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hbr.org'}",Great Corporate Strategies Thrive on the Right Amount of Tension,https://hbr.org/2017/11/great-corporate-strategies-thrive-on-the-right-amount-of-tension,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2017/11/nov17-22-506000622-Azri-Suratmin.jpg,,Hbr.org,tension,1
Joori Roh,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Troops from North and South Korea began removing some landmines along their heavily fortified border on Monday, the South’s defense ministry said, in a pact to reduce tension and build trust on the divided peninsula. Project details were agreed during last month’s summit in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, between its leader, Kim Jong Un, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. In a statement, the ministry said the two sides agreed to remove all landmines in the so-called Joint Security Area (JSA) in Panmunjom within the next 20 days, with military engineers performing the hazardous task on the South Korean side. There was no immediate confirmation from North Korea that its troops had begun the process. The deal also provides for removal of guard posts and weapons from the JSA to follow the removal of the mines, with the troops remaining there to be left unarmed. The JSA is the only spot along the 250-km (155-mile) -long “demilitarized zone” (DMZ) where troops from both Koreas are face to face. South Korean troops have gradually taken over most operations along their side of the border but international forces under the U.S.-led United Nations Command retain major roles, especially at the JSA, where an American commander and a South Korean deputy lead the security battalion. UNC spokesman Colonel Chad Carroll declined to confirm if the command would also withdraw any weapons from the JSA, but said American forces would provide support for the demining operation. “United States Forces Korea will perform a support role - to include having air medical evacuation assets available to respond within minutes of any potential medical emergencies,” he told Reuters in a statement. Since fighting during the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in a stalemate, at least nine soldiers have been killed in incidents with North Korean troops, including the killing in 1976 of two U.S. soldiers by axe-wielding North Koreans, the UNC says. In November 2017, North Korean troops at the JSA shot one of their soldiers defecting to the South five times. More recently, it was the scene of the first dramatic April summit between Kim and Moon, as well as their second, more low-key meeting, in May. In April, the neighbors announced their intention to turn the DMZ - long a symbol of tension and division - into a “peace zone”. They have already dismantled propaganda loudspeakers and some guard posts along the border. Demining projects are also set to begin on Monday in Gangwon province in South Korea’s east, to allow teams to search for the remains of soldiers killed in the war, the ministry added. More than a million landmines were laid in border areas including the DMZ and the Civilian Control Zone in the South, say demining experts, and civilians and soldiers alike have been killed or injured by them. In 2015, two South Korean soldiers were maimed by what Seoul said was a North Korean landmine, an accusation the North denied.

Heekyong Yang,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has declined to accept a list of South Korean journalists hoping to observe the closure of its nuclear test site, South Korea said on Friday, raising new questions about the North’s commitment to reducing tension. North Korea had invited a limited number of journalists from South Korea and other countries to witness what it said will be the closing of its only nuclear weapons test site at Punggye-ri next week. The North Korean offer to scrap the test site has been seen as major concession in months of easing tension between it, on the one hand, and South Korea and the United States on the other. But the remarkable progress appears to have been checked in recent days with North Korea raising doubts about an unprecedented June 12 summit in Singapore between leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, and calling off talks with the South. The South Korean Unification Ministry, which handles dealings with the North, said on Friday North Korea had “declined to accept” the list of journalists submitted by the South for the test site dismantling. The ministry did not elaborate but the North Korean decision is likely to raise doubts about its plan for the test site. Trump on Thursday sought to placate North Korea after it threatened to call off the June summit, saying Kim’s security would be guaranteed in any deal and his country would not suffer the fate of Muammar Gaddafi’s Libya, unless that could not be reached. North Korea had said on Wednesday it might not attend the Singapore summit if the United States continued to demand it unilaterally abandon its nuclear arsenal, which it has developed in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions to counter perceived U.S. hostility. On Thursday, North Korea’s chief negotiator called South Korea “ignorant and incompetent” and denounced U.S.-South Korean air combat drills and threatened to halt all talks with the South. Trump, in rambling remarks in the White House’s Oval Office, said as far as he knew the summit was still on track, but that the North Korean leader was possibly being influenced by Beijing. But he also stressed that North Korea would have to abandon its nuclear weapons and warned that if no deal was reached, North Korea could be “decimated” like Libya or Iraq. ‘PEACEFUL MEANS’ China, responding to U.S. President Donald Trump suggestion that Beijing may be influencing North Korea’s new hardline stance, said on Friday it stands for stability and peace on the Korean peninsula and for settlement of confrontation over its development of weapons through talks. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked about Trump’s comments, said China’s position had not changed and he reiterated that it supported the goal of denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. “We are consistently supporting all relevant parties in resolving the peninsula issue through political consultations and peaceful means,” Lu told a regular briefing. Kim has made two visits to China recently for talks with President Xi Jinping, including a secretive train trip to Beijing in late March, his first known visit outside North Korea since coming to power. He flew to the port city of Dalian this month. Both times, Kim’s encounters with Xi were cast by Chinese state media as friendly. They included beachside strolls and Xi saying that previous generations of North Korean and Chinese leaders had visited each other as often as relatives. The warmth between the two leaders marks a sharp reversal in what had been months of frosty ties, as China ratcheted up sanction pressure on North Korea in response to its relentless missiles and nuclear tests last year. China is North Korea’s largest trading partner and considers it an important security buffer against the U.S. military presence in region. What had seemed until this week to be rapidly warming ties between North Korea, on the one hand, and South Korea and the United States on the other, had fueled fears in Beijing that it might be left out of a new deal on the peninsula, according to analysts.

Reuters Editorial,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China called on Monday for all countries to make constructive efforts to ease tension after North Korea said the latest U.N. sanctions against it are an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade. The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad. The U.S.-drafted resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Council to further reductions if it were to conduct another nuclear test or launch another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea on Sunday rejected the resolution, calling it an act of war. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the resolution appropriately strengthened the sanctions but was not designed to affect ordinary people, normal economic exchanges and cooperation, or humanitarian aid. Hua noted it also called for the use of peaceful means to resolve the issue and that all sides should take steps to reduce tension. “In the present situation, we call on all countries to exercise restraint and make proactive and constructive efforts to ease the tensions on the peninsula and appropriately resolve the issue,” she told a daily news briefing. The North’s old allies China and Russia both supported the latest U.N. sanctions. Tension has been rising over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House. In November, North Korea demanded a halt to what it called “brutal sanctions”, saying a round imposed after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 constituted genocide. North Korea on Nov. 29 said it successfully tested a new ICBM that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. U.S. diplomats have made clear they are seeking a diplomatic solution but proposed the new, tougher sanctions resolution to ratchet up pressure on North Korea’s leader. China, with which North Korea does some 90 percent of its trade, has repeatedly called for calm and restraint from all sides and for a return to talks.

Fayaz Bukhari,"SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - India should talk to Pakistan and separatists in Kashmir to defuse tension raised by a suicide attack on an Indian paramilitary convoy that was claimed by Pakistan-based militants, a former chief minister of the state said. 
Mehbooba Mufti, who was the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir from early 2014 to June last year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party withdrew support for her regional party, said an ongoing crackdown on militants and those supporting secession could further alienate the people. 
India has vowed to kill all the militants in the country’s only Muslim-majority state if they don’t give up arms, after a 20-year-old local man killed 40 paramilitary troopers in a suicide attack last month. 
The attack nearly led to another war between the arch rivals India and Pakistan, which both claim the Himalayan region in full but rule in part. 
“I strongly feel that there has to be a dialogue process internally as well as externally, with Pakistan,” Mufti said in an interview on Friday. “The situation is going to get worse if some kind of political process is not initiated on the ground now.” 
Indian officials have repeatedly ruled out talks with Pakistan unless it acts on militant groups based there. India says its warplanes late last month bombed a militant camp in Pakistan, which responded with an aerial attack the next day. 
Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said on the day of the strike that it had killed many Jaish-e-Mohammed “terrorists”. Pakistan said no one was killed. 
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has sought to speak with Modi amid the hostility, said no militant group would be allowed to operate from his country to carry out attacks abroad, days after his government announced a sweeping crackdown against Islamist militant organizations. 
“This confrontational attitude - no talks, no discussion -has an impact,” Mufti said. “Whatever relationship we have with Pakistan, it has a direct impact on Jammu and Kashmir and we are the worst sufferers of this animosity.” 
Indian authorities have arrested many separatist leaders in Kashmir in the past few weeks, and the chief of Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said recently that the government had made it clear to them that “if they want to live in India, they will have to speak the language of India, not Pakistan’s”. 
Mufti, whose father was also a chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, said the tough stance by Indian authorities would only lead to “some calm on the surface” that won’t last. India killed 248 militants in Kashmir in 2018 - the highest in a decade. 
“Once you start choking the space for dissent in a democracy, people feel pushed to the wall and then it leads to further dissent and alienation,” she said. 
Mufti said India’s general election - starting April 11 and whose results will be declared on May 23 - could delay the process of any inter-party talks on Kashmir.

Hyonhee Shin,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korean officials inspected work to ease tension on their militarized border on Wednesday, checking on the demolition of bunkers and probing for secret tunnels, despite scant progress on persuading the North to give up nuclear arms. The two sides destroyed 11 guard posts within 1 km (0.6 mile) of each side of the heavily fortified border and withdrew equipment and personnel late last month, as a first step in a military pact reached in September between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “Our verification team brought stethoscope-like equipment to see if there were underground tunnels, but the North side did not stop them nor express discomfort and actively cooperated,” Moon’s spokesman, Kim Eui-kyeom, told a news briefing. A year ago, such a joint operation by some 77 officials from the two sides would have been unthinkable. North Korea’s repeated missile tests and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September 2017, in defiance of U.N. and U.S. warnings, had stirred fears of war. But things have changed at a head-spinning pace over the past 12 months. In a New Year message last year, Kim extended an olive branch to old enemy South Korea, then sent a team to the Winter Olympics there in February, and held three summits with Moon over the course of the year. Kim also met U.S. President Donald Trump for an unprecedented summit in Singapore in June. Moon said the removal of the border guard posts and Wednesday’s two-way verification exercise marked a “new milestone” in the 65-year division of the peninsula. “It’s something we couldn’t even imagine in the past that the South and the North build trails in the Demilitarized Zone where they confronted each other, and pull out the guard posts and transparently verify it,” Moon told aides after watching a broadcast of the inspection. Live video footage showed soldiers equipped with telescopes and other equipment gathered at the Military Demarcation Line then crossing the border together to visit the demolished posts on both sides. The soldiers checked that all firearms, personnel and lookout posts were removed, and tunnels and other facilities destroyed, the South’s defense ministry said. The atmosphere was “cordial” and soldiers chatted and shared cigarettes, Moon’s spokesman said. Moon is hoping to host Kim in Seoul for their fourth summit, perhaps as early as this month, but North Korea has been aloof amid stalled nuclear talks with the United States. North and South Korea are technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Kim and Trump vowed in their June talks in Singapore to work toward denuclearization, but they have made little progress.

Reuters Editorial,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A rise in tension between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in a row over military flights threatens U.S. strategic interests in the Gulf and could benefit regional rival Iran. Abu Dhabi says Qatari air force jets intercepted two UAE civilian aircraft on commercial flights to Bahrain last month, and Doha says UAE military aircraft violated its airspace on Dec. 21 and Jan. 3. Each denies the other’s accusations and the two energy-producing states have sought to ease the dispute. The risk of a confrontation between them has increased but a war between them is unlikely, regional experts say. The increase in tension, seven months after the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt imposed travel and trade sanctions on Qatar over accusations -- denied by Doha -- that it supports terrorism and regional rival Iran, has alarmed Washington. “When you have Qatari (military) planes being scrambled near a civilian airliner, it runs the risk of an incident that, even unplanned, could result in the loss of lives and escalate this into an situation Gulf countries have never had among each other,” said a Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. Gabriel Collins, an expert on financial sanctions at Rice University in Texas, said “military posturing” against a background of underlying tension because of the diplomatic and trade sanctions “left space for a miscalculation.” “A very small spark can, in a worst-case scenario, light a huge fire,” he said. U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has said the fracturing of ties among its Gulf Arab allies hinders Washington’s fight against Islamic State and “countering the spread of Iran’s malign influence”. Iran has criticized the restrictions on Qatar and called for the rift to be resolved through dialogue. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has lamented what he called a “dialogue deficit” in the region. The Gulf is a strategically important area for the United States. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain and the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is a center of its air operations against Islamic State. “The United States considers both Qatar and the UAE to be critical regional partners,” a U.S. Air Forces Central Command spokesman in Qatar said in response to a Reuters request for comment on the incidents. He called for “meaningful solutions to reduce tensions.” The base would be crucial if the United States were to go to war with Iran, which Washington says sponsors terrorism and is a threat to stability and U.S. interests in the Middle East. Tehran denies the accusations. FILE PHOTO: People take part in Qatar's National Day celebrations in Doha, Qatar, December 18, 2017. REUTERS/Naseem Zeitoon/File Photo REGIONAL RIVALRY Predominantly Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia also sees Iran as a threat to regional stability and regards the Islamist Republic, which is majority Shi‘ite, as its main rival in the region. But more than any of the countries boycotting Qatar, the UAE bristles at alleged Qatari support for Islamists throughout the region and maintains a hard line against the Muslim Brotherhood, branches of which are supported by Doha in some countries. There are trade risks for the West as well as security concerns. “The rivalry between Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies with Iran is raging. These are key trade and security partners to the West for decades and if they are divided and very nearly coming to military blows, in this zero-sum atmosphere, Iran stands to gain and the U.S. to lose,” another Western diplomat said. An Arab official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the UAE, because of its competing regional vision with Qatar, wanted to pile pressure on Doha to signal a reconciliation is not close and the boycott will not soon end. “Saudi Arabia and the other quartet countries have little to fear for their economies from this crisis, though Qatar does,” the official said. “Also, because the UAE is so interested in enforcing its demands on Qatar and curtailing its activities in the region, that makes the two countries eager to prove in this phase that they won’t be giving up soon and can escalate if necessary.” U.S. President Donald Trump appears to have softened his view of Doha. He initially blessed the boycott, accusing Doha of funding terrorism “at a very high level.” But he offered in September to mediate and this month telephoned Qatar’s ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, to thank him for his counter-terrorism efforts. The change follows a charm offensive by Doha, which in recent months has hosted several right-wing commentators close to the president and matched the UAE’s lobbying efforts in Washington. The change appears to reflect a political calculation among the Gulf states’ Western partners that Qatar would not risk allowing the rift with the UAE to deteriorate further, one of the Western diplomats said.

Martin Kaste,"A wolf in its enclosure at the Hexentanzplatz zoo in Thale, northern Germany. Klaus-Dietmar Gabbert/AFP/Getty Images Wolves are making a big comeback in Germany, which is making some Germans uneasy. Farmers and hunters drove the species out of the country over 150 years ago, but conditions for wolves became more welcoming in 1990, after Germany's reunification extended European endangered species protections to the eastern part of the country. Since 2000, the Central European gray wolves have been moving back, mostly from Poland. In Brandenburg state, which surrounds Berlin, the number of known wolf packs jumped from zero in 2007 to 26 this year, according to the state's environmental office. That has come as a shock to many farmers, who now have to worry about protecting livestock from predators. They don't lose many animals to wolves nationally, but the few incidents that happen can be dramatic. In April, at least 40 sheep were killed in a single attack, and news reports described the aftermath as looking ""like horror. "" At an anti-wolf rally in November in Brandenburg's capital of Potsdam, farmer Marco Hintze said farmers should once again have the right to shoot at wolves. ""If we miss him it's OK, if we don't miss him, [it shouldn't be] against the law, and that's what we try to fight for,"" Hintze says. He says government officials are insensitive to the worries of people living in the countryside. He thinks urban Germans have come to romanticize the returning wolves. ""They think, 'Aww, it's a nice wolf, and he needs to be in nature and be free.' But people raised in the countryside, they don't need the wolf anymore,"" Hintze says. There are many similarities with wolf politics in the American West, where hunters and ranchers also criticize wolf restoration as a policy supported by urban environmentalists who don't have to live with the everyday reality of having the predator around. Soil ecologist Hans-Holger Liste out for a walk in the woods by his home near Berlin. He welcomes the returning wolf population in this region, and takes part in pro-wolf activism. Martin Kaste/NPR Dirk Wellershoff, with the Brandenburg Hunting Society (Landesjagdverband Brandenburg ), sees the returning wolves as a symptom of a bigger political problem. ""I get the impression that our politics in all of Germany is getting distant from the people and our concerns,"" he says. ""And we observe very clearly with the wolves how our problems aren't being seen... and solutions aren't being found."" Hans-Holger Liste, a soil ecologist who volunteers with a pro-wolf organization called Wolfsschutz Deutschland, says political attitudes on the issue mirror the left-right split that he's observed in the U.S. ""Definitely, I would say it's going to be the same,"" he says. In the last round of elections in Germany, ""the Left Party and the Green Party were almost 100 percent pro-wolf, and the party of very conservative people were basically against wolves."" By the ""very conservative people,"" he means the Alternative for Germany, an upstart party on the far right that has built up political clout by campaigning against immigration of humans. But now they're also against the arriving wolves. Liste says there are good environmental reasons to protect the wolves. The returning predators help to control the overabundant deer population, which in turn limits the damage hungry deer do to newly planted trees. He also acknowledges emotional reasons for supporting the wolves. Liste finds it exciting to have them moving back into the woods around his house in Beelitz, near Berlin. ""If you meet them for the first time, it's like a spiritual experience. They stand there, they're not afraid of anything, they don't run from you, they just move slowly away,"" Liste says. He thinks most of his neighbors share his feelings, but he knows there's intense anger in other parts of rural Germany. Over the summer, in the eastern state of Saxony, authorities found the remains of a female wolf that had been illegally shot and then sunk into a lake with a concrete weight. ""It was such a gruesome act of killing,"" Liste says. ""As the media called it, it was like a mafia killing."" He thinks some of the hostility toward the wolves is a remnant of fairy tales such as Little Red Riding Hood. He loved those stories when he was a kid, he says though he usually sympathized with the wolves. The animal is likely to be an important issue in the next local elections, Liste predicts. There have been more high-profile incidents, including the report of an attack on a 55-year-old man in northern Germany in November. It's not certain it was a wolf that bit him wolf attacks on humans are very unusual, and a subsequent DNA test of his wound was inconclusive but the report threatens to inflame fears for the safety of children in rural areas. At the federal level, Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union party responded to the growing tensions by proposing a downgrade to the legal protections for wolves, which would allow for some hunting. Journalist Anna Noryskiewicz contributed reporting for this story from Potsdam, Germany.","Germany is seeing the return of wolf packs, and with them growing political tension over whether the animals pose too much of a threat.",2018-12-15T13:02:49Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Wolves Are Back In Germany, But Not Always Welcome",https://www.npr.org/2018/12/15/672434852/wolves-are-back-in-germany-but-not-always-welcome,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/12/04/gettyimages-901426666_wide-273e31557d6c519820abc848c3f09be2a3340191.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,tension,1
Lizbeth Diaz,"CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexico’s presidential front-runner launches his campaign close to the U.S. border on Sunday amid tension over U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to put up a wall between the countries. If leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador wins the July 1 election, he is expected to be less accommodating toward Trump than the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has been lagging in polls because of anger over its failure to contain violence and graft. His three-month campaign starts in Ciudad Juarez, a tribute to the city’s namesake Benito Juarez, the 19th century Mexican president from indigenous roots whose exiled government resisted a French colonialist intervention from the unruly border city. Lopez Obrador recently criticized President Enrique Pena Nieto for “governing with recipes sent from abroad,” but he has lately softened his opposition to the government’s policy of allowing foreign investment in the oil industry. The ruling party candidate trailing in third place, former finance minister Jose Antonio Meade, launches his own campaign on Sunday at the other end of the country in the southeastern town of Merida. Second-place Ricardo Anaya began campaigning on Friday. Silver-haired leftist Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor, first ran for president in 2006. He would seek a meeting with Trump “as soon as possible” a senior advisor said, while indicating foreign policy would hew less closely to U.S. regional priorities if he wins. Trump’s tough trade policies, insults against Mexican migrants and demands for the border wall have angered ordinary Mexicans who see their country as a natural ally of the United States. Lopez Obrador has made clear U.S.-Mexican relations will remain strong if he wins, while promising to throw Trump a “curve ball” and defend Mexican pride. His unconventional, and at times inconsistent, policy stances have sometimes led to comparisons with the U.S. president. He supports the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and the United States, but has called for talks started by Trump to renegotiate the deal to be suspended until after the election. In a possible sign of the moderation Lopez Obrador is keen to project, Ciudad Juarez also harbored another of his heroes — Francisco I. Madero, a wealthy, U.S.-educated, moderate leader of the Mexican revolution who tried to unite conservatives and radicals. However, the 64-year-old continues to play to his leftist base, attacking the current government over a $13 billion airport project he says is tainted by corruption. He has promised to “consult the people” on reforms and plans to turn the presidential residence into a cultural center, sell the presidential plane and cut his salary in half. The candidate’s foreign policy advisor, Hector Vasconcelos, has said U.S. relations should be aimed at bolstering economic cooperation and that the current ties over-emphasize police and military relations. Vasconcelos also said Mexico would not follow the United States in sanctioning socialist Venezuela, and would refrain from foreign interference to focus on critical problems at home such as violence. As well as its storied history, in modern times Ciudad Juarez, opposite El Paso in Texas, has been the scene of the murders of hundreds of women, many of them low-salaried workers in export factories. That horror, mirrored in towns across Mexico during a decade of extreme drug violence, is another reason Lopez Obrador chose the city to start campaigning, an advisor said. “It is a symbol of the need to heal Mexican pain,” said senior campaign member Tatiana Clouthier. Angel Perez, 29, a Mexican national who lives in El Paso, said he would attend Sunday’s campaign launch with his wife and two daughters, hopeful that Lopez Obrador will deliver on promises for change. “I think he has what it takes to put Trump in his place,” he said.

Emily Sullivan,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shakes hands with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesady. Leah Mills/AP Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Saudi Arabia after being dispatched by President Trump to meet with members of the royal court amid growing international tension over the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Pompeo met on Tuesday with King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud in the Saudi capital and financial hub of Riyadh. ""Thank you for accepting my visit on behalf of President Trump,"" Pompeo said on meeting the king. Details of the meeting were not immediately made public. Pompeo will meet later Tuesday with Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, dining with the prince in the evening. Khashoggi, an outspoken critic of Saudi policy, has not been seen since he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago. The Turkish government alleges that he was murdered by Saudi agents a charge the Saudis have denied. However, The New York Times and CNN report that the kingdom is preparing to acknowledge in an official report that Khashoggi died during a botched interrogation. Both the Times and CNN caution that the details of the Saudi's report, based on tips from anonymous sources familiar with the Saudi investigation, could change. A Turkish paper has alleged that a team of 15 Saudi men flew into Istanbul on Oct. 2, hours before Khashoggi was last seen entering the consulate, describing the men as an assassination squad. On Tuesday, Turkish investigators searched the consulate building. Reuters reports the team conducted a nine-hour search of the premises, and left with evidence, including soil samples. Trump told reporters on Monday that he spoke with the Saudi king, who has ""firmly denied"" any knowledge of Khashoggi's whereabouts. ""I don't want to get into his mind but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers,"" the president said. ""Who knows? We're going to try getting to the bottom of it very soon. But his was a flat denial."" The remarks were a departure from what the president said during an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes last week, when he threatened the kingdom with ""severe punishment"" if it turned out that Khashoggi had been murdered. On Monday, Trump tweeted that he was sending Pompeo to meet with King Salman in an effort to ""find an answer."" Khashoggi's disappearance has caused U.S.-based companies, including Uber, JPMorgan Chase and Google which planned this year to build five innovation hubs in Saudi Arabia to pull out of a high-profile investment summit in Riyadh scheduled for later this month. The cancellations are a blow to the government, which has tried to market itself as an open, innovative place to invest and do business. On Friday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told reporters he still plans to attend the Riyadh investment summit; however, the president said Monday it was possible the U.S. would not attend, but that no decision had been as yet.",President Trump dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the kingdom amid international tension over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.,2018-10-16T11:29:39Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Pompeo Arrives In Saudi Arabia To Discuss Khashoggi Disappearance,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/16/657735722/pompeo-arrives-in-saudi-arabia-to-discuss-khashoggi-disappearance,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/10/16/ap_18289346588832_wide-7906e8fdad64c08275322dd7b197429329f5141d.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,tension,1

Laignee Barron,"Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, has called American attendance at South Korean winter games into question, citing escalating tension with North Korea. Haley told Fox News on Wednesday night that American athletes’ participation in the games is an “ open question,” according to a transcript from CNN. The games — scheduled for Feb. 9-25 in Pyeonchang, South Korea — come amid increasing hostility between Washington and South Korea’s northern neighbor. While acknowledging that she has not “heard anything about” whether the athletes will be participating, Haley said the Trump administration would “find out the best way” to ensure U.S. athletes’ safety. She said: “In the talks that we have — whether it’s Jerusalem or North Korea — it’s about, how do we protect the US citizens in the area?” Safety concerns have persistently dogged the upcoming Olympic event. Last month, the U.N. General Assembly adopted the Olympic Truce Resolution for the South Korean games, stipulating that all conflicts must cease for the duration of the event. However, last week, the Russian Olympic team was banned from participating in the 2018 Winter games after a state-sponsored doping scandal that the International Olympic Committee called “unprecedented.” Athletes from Russia can now only participate as individual competitors.",The games come amid increasing tension on the Korean peninsula,2017-12-07T08:11:45Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Nikki Haley Questions U.S. Participation in the Winter Olympics Amid Tensions With North Korea,http://time.com/5053592/us-winter-olympics-korea/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/gettyimages-882016058.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,tension,1
Tom McKay,"Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei and the daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, was detained in Canada late last year at the behest of U.S. authorities, who allege she oversaw a complex financial scam to violate nuclear sanctions on Iran. The incident has become a major source of tension amid the ongoing U.S.-China trade warand according to a Tuesday report in Reuters, newly discovered corporate filings and other documents show the depth of Huaweis ties to Iran as well as Syria.
U.S. authorities claim that Meng lied to international banking institutions about Huaweis ties to Skycom, a Hong Kong-based company that did business with Iranian telecoms, and a Mauritius-based shell company that controlled Skycoms shares since 2007, Canicula Holdings Ltd. While Meng has insisted that Huawei cut ties to Skycom in 2009, U.S. authorities believe that Huawei had total control over Skycom (and that it was staffed mainly by Huawei employees) as well as Canicula.
Reuters wrote that U.S. investigators believe the purpose of doing so was to trick international banks into clearing hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions that may have violated sanctions on Iran, including attempted sales of embargoed HP gear.
Documents obtained by Reuters seem to show yet more suspicious overlap between Huawei and Skycom, as well as evidence Huawei used Canicula as a front in Syria. Reuters wrote:
... Skycom records filed in Hong Kong, where the company was registered, show that its shares were transferred in November 2007 to Canicula. Canicula, which was registered in Mauritius in 2006, continued to hold Skycom shares for about a decade, Skycom records show.
... [Documents] reveal that a high-level Huawei executive appears to have been appointed Skycoms Iran manager. They also show that at least three Chinese-named individuals had signing rights for both Huawei and Skycom bank accounts in Iran. Reuters also discovered that a Middle Eastern lawyer said Huawei conducted operations in Syria through Canicula.
Furthermore, corporate records filed by Skycom in Iran in 2011 stated that an individual by the name of Shi Yaohong had managed its business for two years, Reuters wrote. An Emirates News Agency press release identified him as a Huawei official in 2010, while a LinkedIn account matching that name identified the holder as Huaweis President Middle East Region in 2012. Reuters added:
Shi, now president of Huaweis software business unit, hung up the phone when Reuters asked him about his relationship with Skycom.
Determining exactly who controlled Canicula from publicly available records had been difficult because Mauritius is an offshore haven similar to the British Virgin Islands, the Wall Street Journal wrote in December 2018. However, the paper noted that Meng became a director of Skycom for over a year after Huaweis shares in it had been transferred to Canicula.
More evidence linking Canicula to Huawei is present in the Reuters report.
After a Middle Eastern business news website, http://Aliqtisadi.com, published a brief article about the dissolution of a Huawei company in Syria that specialized in automated teller machine (ATM) equipment in 2014, Reuters wrote, it received a letter from attorney Osama Karawani (an appointed liquidator in the sale) asking for a correction. In that letter, Karawani said that the article inaccurately implied Huawei itself had disbanded, rather than the subsidiary.
Huawei was never dissolved, he wrote. Instead, the company has been and is still operating in Syria through several companies which are Huawei Technologies Ltd and Canicula Holdings Ltd.
Other sources told Reuters that U.S. investigators are aware that Huawei is linked to Canicula and that the latter had an office in Damascus.
Skycom liquidated in June 2017, Reuters concluded, while Canicula announced without explanation or named attribution months later that it had ceased operations in Syria.
Whether or not Canada will ultimately extradite Meng to the U.S.where more evidence may come to light as to who really controlled Skycom and Caniculawill have to be determined through an extensive legal battle. The Huawei executive won a $7.5 million bail ruling in December 2018, though she was ordered to surrender passports, submit to a nightly curfew, pay for a 24/7 security detail at her home in Vancouver, and wear a GPS ankle monitor.

Catie Keck,"This week, in a letter addressing individual workers of the food delivery service DoorDash, the companys co-founder and CEO Tony Xu appeared to finally face brewing tension over the startups tipping model. In the letter, Xu said the company would be organizing surveys and roundtables with its delivery workers, independent contractors called dashers, about what they think DoorDash should be doing better. Xu wrote that DoorDash had heard from some who expressed confusion about how pay is calculated and what happens with tips.
The letter follows a controversy that reached its proverbial tipping point a few weeks ago after the company defended the payment systemone in which tips help make up workers wages instead of supplementing themeven as one of its competitors that had recently implemented a similar model acknowledged that it was bad practice. Speaking with Bloomberg in February after closing a $400 million funding round, Xu said: There was no coverage of this two years ago. But all of a sudden theres coverage because of an experiment that another company ran.
That DoorDashs pay modelwhich has been in place since 2017is still causing confusion among workers and indeed, even customers, is alarming. However, a survey of interviews with four current and former dashers as well as three former DoorDash corporate workers, emails to the companys contractors, past marketing materials, screengrabs from a private dasher group on Facebook, and screenshots of the platform itself paint a picture of a system thats confusing as if by design.
DoorDash, a San Francisco-based on-demand delivery service valued at $7.1 billion, was founded in 2013 and counts Y Combinator and SoftBank Vision Fund among its backers. Its currently the reigning king for total consumer spend in food delivery services ahead of its competitors Uber Eats and Grubhub, according to research firm Edison Trends. Part of its recipe for success may be its expanded offering of restaurants, including upscale city joints that boost spending, Edison co-founder Hetal Pandya told the Wall Street Journal.
An overarching criticism of the so-called gig economy at largeincluding services like Uber and Amazon Flexis that wages often dont account for some expenses necessary to do the job, such as gas, car payments, and wear and tear on drivers vehicles. For these kinds of jobs, the benefits dont always outweigh the wages or risks of the workand thats not always immediately clear to workers. But DoorDash appears especially eager to bend truths about the reality of its service to further its ambitions, particularly in its messaging.
Prior to 2017, DoorDashs system in most of its markets was to pay dashers a fixed rate per delivery, which varied depending on the city. Versions of the dasher website archived throughout 2016 indicate that could be anywhere from $5-7 per dash in San Diego, $8 per dash in San Francisco, $6 per dash in Seattle, or $5 per dash in Manhattan. The company did and continues to say that drivers are able to keep 100 percent of their earned tips. (This is also the law.)
DoorDash announced to dashers midway through 2017 that it was restructuring its payment model, according to emails about the change as well as interviews with DoorDash workers. Under this new model, the company presented dashers with a guaranteed wage they could earn per dash. Lets take for example a dash that earns $8. DoorDash agreed to pay at least $1 of that figure. If a customer tipped less than the guaranteed amount, DoorDash said it would issue a boost payment to make up for the difference to meet the promised wage. If a customer tipped over the amount, DoorDash would pay $1, and tips would make up the rest of the earnings. In other words, dashers do get to keep their tips, theyre just also helping to offset the wages that the company would otherwise have to pay its workers.
According to a former employee who worked at the company during the spring of 2017, DoorDash spent months ironing out the model and its messaging before overhauling its payment structure. Indeed, in his email to dashers this week, Xu said the company conducted months of testing and surveyed thousands of Dashers prior to rollout. The company told corporate employees internally at the time that the new pay system was designed to benefit workers, according to two corporate employees. But when announcing the model at an all-hands meeting, one source said, the company glossed over specifics about how it worked, instead emphasizing the claim that dashers were happier with it.
An email about the rollout to a dasher in the Northern California market in September of 2017 called the new model a fairer and more transparent pay model. The company claimed that dashers could earn more and have added clarity about how much theyd earn per dash ahead of time. It also said that some 80 percent of workers preferred this new model. But immediately after launch, some dasherslamented on Reddit that they were making less per order under the new model, despite the companys assurances that workers could make more. And despite DoorDashs claim that the new system was intended to be more transparent, some said guaranteed pay calculations wereunclear.
DoorDash claims that it calculates the guaranteed dasher pay rate based on a variety of factors, including distance, travel time, the size of the order, and whether the delivery must be placed by the dasher at the restaurant or store. Further complicating an already confusing payment system, DoorDashs app does not disclose to the dashers how much a customer tips per order, according to multiple current dashers for the company who spoke with Gizmodo on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs. And even when a dash looks like it could bring in some serious cash, its possible that DoorDashs measly $1 contribution combined with the customer tip wont square up to much more than the dashs guaranteed rate, as one former dasher explained to Gizmodo.
Sometimes youll get one that looks great, and it looks like its going to be profitable, but you dont get any real tip on top of what theyre guaranteeing you. You cant really complain because thats what they guaranteed you and thats it, this person said. It just seemed like a backwards way of doing business. Like theyre shuffling the deck behind the scenes sort of thing, you know?
Its also hard for dashers to know where their money is coming from. The company makes it impossible for us to know how were getting paid each delivery, a current dasher said. They dont let us know how much the customer tips us and they dont let us know how much DoorDash gives us off each individual delivery. Multiple dashers said they had spoken with customers directly about how much they tipped on an order to calculate how much was being counted toward their wage.
If customers would just tip in cash, [DoorDash] would actually have to pay us a decent wage to deliver, one dasher said.
Depending on the market, a decent wage is a bit of a tumble from the roughly $20 an hour that DoorDash advertises in some areas. On Craigslist, the company uses seemingly intentionally crafty wording to advertise its apparent hourly rates. A listing in early March for dashers in the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, boasted that dashers could make as much as $21 or more an hour. An ad for dashers in San Diego dangled potential earnings of $19 or more. And dashers, the company claimed, could make as much as $20 an hour in Seattle.
People who worked on the corporate side at DoorDash said the company took precious care to manage its messaging. One former worker said this is especially true of the language used on platforms like Craigslist to advertise for dashers. This person claimed that when constructing headlines, using language like up to is intended to shift accountability about how much drivers can reasonably expect to earn per hour. These ads are meant to be enticing and are designed to motivate workers even if the figures cited are in the upper percentile of what the average worker might expect to make. But ads like these can create confusion for workers who see one thing in an ad and something entirely different on their paychecks.
(DoorDash did not respond to multiple emails requesting comment.)
Shannon Liss-Riordan, a workers rights attorney who specializes in independent contractor misclassification cases, has brought cases against more than a dozen gig economy employers like Postmates, Lyft, and others, and recently reached a $20 million settlement with Uber. Liss-Riordan has pursued multiple suits against DoorDash in particular, including one over employee misclassification that resulted in a $5 million settlement with the company in 2017. As part of the settlement, DoorDash overhauled some of its policies, including more creating more transparency around account deactivation and establishing channels of communication between dashers and the companys management.
In terms of the dasher payment system currently in place, Liss-Riordan said that while what DoorDash is doing is disingenuous, the company isnt technically breaking the law. Liss-Riordan explained the DoorDash model might be in violation of labor laws if, for example, the company was advertising that they would pay $12 an hour plus tips. But, she added, I think these companies are all very crafty and careful to make sure they put the fine print somewhere that were allowed to, you know, set your pay at our discretion.
In his letter to dashers this week, Xu wrote that DoorDash continue[s] to hear from many of you that the model works: you know how much youll receive in advance, you receive the guaranteed minimum even if the customer doesnt tip, and in 2018 U.S. Dashers received on average more than $17.50 per hour on a delivery.
As a rule, the averages companies like DoorDash claim can be misleading. According to one former worker on the corporate side with knowledge of how DoorDash sometimes calculates so-called averages for earnings, the company would use figures pulled from a small pool to represent a larger population of dashers in its ads. For example, this person said, the company might look at data collected from a group of dashers in downtown San Francisco where earnings are high and use those figures to represent the entirety of Northern California. Those numbers might also be pulled from a period months prior, at a time when earnings were especially high.
DoorDash would certainly not be the first company to do this. Uber was forced to cough up $20 million to settle with the Federal Trade Commission in 2017 over its own sketchy ads promoting ballooned potential earnings. But even if the wages being cited by DoorDash represent someone somewhere making that amount of money, the figure might omit granular details like time dashers spend waiting in their cars between orders or time theyre getting gas. Those figures may also omit costs to drivers like gas and maintenance. One former dasher claimed his own back-of-envelope calculations turned up the same holes. Again, due to lack of transparency, the worker is left to guess how exactly this hourly rate is calculated.
They dont count you as working unless youve been assigned a delivery, this person said. So if you sign in for 10 hours, and you get a total of 15 deliveries, you might pull down $125. But between deliveries, there is a lot of sitting around waiting for the next delivery to be assigned. So for a total of 3 hours of that time, you werent working by Doordashs estimation. Thats how they can say that drivers make an average of at least $17.50 an hour. More creative arithmetic, basically.
When Xus email was shared on Reddit, other dashers expressed that the figure he cited seemed like a dubious representation of worker earnings. Redditors speculated about various ways that the company could have arrived at the number, suggesting like the former dasher that perhaps it didnt account for downtime. Others said it almost certainly did not account for expenses to dashers. Some said that after factoring in gas and other expenses, they were making less than minimum wage.
When asked how the various pay models of these companies stack up against each other, Liss-Riordan told Gizmodo that all of these gig economy companies are really basically pulling off the same scam.
Its a little hard to compare because theyre all depriving the workers of their employment and labor code protections, she said. Its hard to say as just a general matter whos doing worse. But all these companies I believe are breaking the law by not acknowledging the employment status of the workers who are performing the labor that is making these businesses so wildly successful.
What is needed is an amendment to the labor code specifying that employers cant alter base pay based on the amount of tips a worker earns, Liss-Riordan said. Recode confirmed in early March that San Franciscos Office of Labor Standards Enforcement has launched a probe into the companys tipping policy, and DoorDash could be slapped with fines and forced to back pay workers if OLSE finds that its violating labor laws. But OLSE director Patrick Mulligan told Recode the investigation could take months or years to reach a conclusion.
In the meantime, two dashers who spoke with Gizmodo said theyre just holding out for something better. One said they are just months away from opening up their own business, and dashing is an interim opportunity to still earn a living while they prepare to take on a significant career adjustment. Another dasher said they are clinging to hope that a distant dasher referral bonus of $2,500 will help bail them out of a sticky living situation.
Im like gritting my teeth, praying to god that we dont get deactivated or something, they said. Were counting on that money.

There are instances where eyeballing is sufficient—like deglazing the pan with roughly half a cup of wine—and there are instances where accurate measurements are vital—like in baking finicky pastry or most recipes from Serious Eats. Measuring your ingredients by mass (i.e., on a kitchen scale ) will give you the best, most reproducible results, but if you insist on measuring by volume, you have to make sure you’re using the right cup.

When I filled a dry cup with water, I found it held an average of 10 grams more water than my liquid measuring cups. This probably wouldn’t make a big difference in something like spaghetti sauce, but 10 grams of extra liquid—or 20 or 30, depending on how many cups the recipe calls for—could really mess you up in baking, or ice cream, or candy making. Also, dry measuring cups just aren’t designed to measure wet ingredients, and vice versa. The correct way to measure a liquid is to place your measuring glass on a flat surface, pour the liquid in just below the line, then bend down to bring your eyes level with the lines of demarcation before slowly adding more liquid until the bottom of the meniscus (the curved line that forms on top of the liquid due to surface tension) is level with the line. You simply cannot do this with a dry measuring cup. Not only are there no lines, but you can’t see the meniscus. Conversely, the ol’ scoop-and-scrape dry measuring method won’t work in a wet measuring cup, as the “cup” line is below the lip of the glass. If you’re working with a real finicky recipe, a scale is always your best friend, but if you don’t have a scale, or find yourself in a kitchen without one, make sure you are using the right “cup” for the job.

Ben Blanchard,"XIAN, China (Reuters) - A top Chinese general attended the opening on Monday of a regional armed forces health forum organized by the Chinese and U.S. militaries, as the two sides set aside friction over trade and territorial issues such as the South China Sea. This week’s Asia Pacific Military Health Exchange in the western city of Xian, best known as the home of the Terracotta Army, has about 600 participants, with military officials from 28 countries, including U.S. allies like Japan and Australia. General Song Puxuan, head of China’s Central Military Commission’s Logistics Support Department, posed for pictures with Terry M. Rauch, acting U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense, at the opening ceremony in a Xian hotel. Song, whose attendance was not announced in advance, did not address the conference. Military sources say he is close to President Xi Jinping and was previously head of the military’s northern command, having risen rapidly up the ranks since Xi took office six years ago. China has been keen to highlight its cooperation with the U.S. military, despite a bitter trade dispute and Chinese suspicion about U.S. support for self-ruled and Chinese-claimed Taiwan, and U.S. involvement in the disputed South China Sea. “This meeting can help promote the healthy and stable development of the two militaries’ ties, and make our contribution towards promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific, providing positive energy,” Song’s colleague, Chen Jingyuan, head of health at the Logistics Support Department, told reporters. Speaking earlier, Chen hailed the exchange as a “first” between the Chinese and U.S. militaries on military health for the Asia Pacific. ‘IMPORTANT TO BE HERE’ Rear Admiral Louis C. Tripoli, command surgeon of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, thanked the People’s Liberation Army for its efforts in arranging the conference. “We hope that you feel how important it is for us to be here,” Tripoli said. He told reporters they had had “very good talks”. “I believe that people are being transparent and are being truthful about the problems that we face in the region from a health standpoint and I believe that everyone is here and eager to work together to solve these problems,” Tripoli said. China was angered in May when the United States withdrew an invitation to a major U.S.-hosted naval drill, saying that closing the door does not promote mutual trust and cooperation. The Rim of the Pacific exercise, known as RIMPAC and previously attended by China, is billed as the world’s largest international maritime exercise and held every two years in Hawaii in June and July. The Pentagon said the withdrawal of the invitation was in response to what it saw as China’s militarization of islands in the South China Sea. Still, China’s navy chief Shen Jinlong plans to pay a working visit to the United States later this month, during which he will attend an international naval forum, according to China’s Defence Ministry.

The heated element, which can be turned on or off, helps to warm the muscles up and keep them limber through the massage.

Zyllion The base has two elastic straps that Velcro together in the middle so you can secure it around a chair or head-rest, though I find that it's better to just keep the straps hanging from the side so you can use them to adjust the positioning of the massager when it's in use. Any purchase of the massager comes with a car adapter that allows you to plug it into a cigarette lighter, but I personally don't advise using this in the car — it's not particularly comfortable when placed right behind your head, and the strength of the nodes will force your head to move around in a way that may be unsafe while driving. It's important to note that one cycle lasts 20 minutes, and 20 minutes really is all you should do at one time. Because my knots are so deep and intense, I used to just keep the massager going for two or three cycles, hoping that I could release the tension completely all in one sitting. But I would always end up with bruises, leaving me in even more discomfort for the days (and sometimes entire weeks) following. I have since learned my lesson, and even though I'm always tempted to let it go for a second cycle, I only use it for 20 minutes a day. Zyllion You don't have to have severe tension to enjoy using this massager. Regardless of how chronic your discomfort is, you might find that this is the perfect way to just release some stress at the end of the day.","The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Associated Press,(DETROIT) — A 39-year-old woman is accused of pulling a knife on another woman during a brawl at a Christmas toy giveaway in Detroit. WXYZ-TV and WWJ-AM estimate that a few hundred people were waiting in line on the city’s northwest side Saturday night when the fight between adults broke out. No injuries have been reported. WXYZ-TV reports that the woman was arrested and the two children who were with her were collected by relatives from a police precinct. Giveaway organizer John Cromer told the television station that “people are already under a lot of stress and tension this time of year” and “all it takes (is) for some people to step on somebody’s shoes or to bump into somebody the wrong way and then a fight ensues.”,"""People are already under a lot of stress and tension this time of year""",2017-12-26T14:51:20Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Woman Accused of Pulling a Knife During Christmas Toy Giveaway Brawl,http://time.com/5079500/detroit-toy-giveaway-brawl/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/hand-cuffs.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,tension,1
Nick Statt,"JLab’s newest pair of sport headphones come with a unique twist: they’re not earbuds. The Flex Sport are over-ear Bluetooth headphones, and they are designed to be worn during all types of workouts and rigorous physical activity. The headphones come with 20 hours of play time and removable ear pads that can be tossed in the washing machine. The model enters a small but growing category of higher-quality audio gear designed for workouts, including over-ear models from JBL / Under Armour and Jabra. JLab says it’s built a technology into the headphones called Be Aware that lets in ambient noise so that you don’t inadvertently injure yourself by missing the shouts and hollers of nearby athletes or workout partners. As for the hardware, the headphones themselves are made of a breathable, mesh-looking material that JLab says is sweatproof, so you won’t fry the underlying circuitry by exerting yourself too hard. The whole package comes with two adjustable tension bands, which are flexible and made of a durable enough material that they won’t snap under pressure.

Gregory Han,"Ivy Ross doesn’t enjoy the same name recognition or cachet as Apple’s Chief Design Officer, Jonathan Ive. But one could strongly argue Ross – not her Cupertino counterpart – is more likely to be remembered as the more influential figure in shaping human interaction with cloud-enhanced technologies as the digital landscape veers toward voice-activated interactivity. As Head of Design for Google Hardware, Ross spearheads the tech giant’s charge into consumer products, injecting the world’s most powerful information technology company with a shot of tactility and emotion identifiably warmer and more human than ever before, yet still undeniably “Googley”. This past autumn Google announced a cohesive collection of 8 home and mobile devices: the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, the AI-enhanced Google Clips camera, a new Daydream VR headset, the stone-shaped Home Mini and its larger wireless speaker sibling the Max, wireless Google Assistant connected Pixel Buds headphones, and the Pixelbook laptop. Ivy Ross/Photo: Google The perpetual exploration of online technologies and cloud services continues to percolate from Mountain View, but it’s under Ross’s guidance the company’s hardware has finally calcified a family of products with a cohesive aesthetic and tactile style. Warm(er) and friendly(ier), this new Google wants a literal place in your home, with designs representing this intention. Just as the company’s search page presents users with a minimalistic point of entry, embellished only by the company’s multicolored logo (or Google Doodles), the latest family of consumer products represents a similar physical manifestation of a friendly entrypoint – products delivering the same interactive simplicity with an undercurrent of playfulness that has defined Google’s search identity. Credit the multi-dimensional Ross for bringing an ebullient and passionate perspective serving an optimistic belief in design, one formed zig-zagging across various industries and companies, including Art.com, Gap, Disney Stores North America, Mattel, Calvin Klein, Coach, Liz Claiborne, Swatch Watch and Avon. It seems almost ironic someone with a career so varied turns out to be the deliverer of a cohesive design message – a second generation of consumer hardware products all merging toward a point of commonality previously unseen in previous iterations of Google products. Ross spoke to us about what exactly makes this generation of Google consumer product still identifiably Google, but ever more accessible. Google has established itself as an data technologies and app driven company, but it finally seems Google is focused on establishing its own identity in hardware. How would you characterize this newfound identity? Human, optimistic, and bold. Google now has a fun element to it. Our optimism shows through with touches of colored buttons and little details we’ve added throughout to surprise. I think “bold” is also very much part of Google’s culture. We’re permitted moonshots, trying things and going for it. Design explorations of the Panda Pixel 2 XL flagship smartphone. What’s most noticeable now is a continuity that wasn’t apparent before, a visual and material language connecting the gap between technology and object. I think as a design line we want to keep things simple, but tried to incorporate more than one material within every product. For example, the Pixel 2 phone can be partnered with some beautiful fabric cases. The fabric covered cases definitely deliver a confident grip. But the Pixel 2 XL is also very pleasurable to hold sans case; the exterior isn’t so slick that it’s slippery like some phones. My boss Rick and I both have the Panda, the black and white version of the Pixel 2 XL. One day during a meeting we both took our phones out and I made a remark about his phone without a case. “You can’t cover it. It’s too beautiful.” Feel overcame fear. I love that. Well, if mine breaks, I know where I can get a new one [laughing]. Could you give an example of “trying things and going for it”? I don’t know if you have….you probably don’t have it yet…do you have the Biggie? Biggie – the Google Home Max – can be oriented horizontally or vertically. Usually you have to put these ugly little feet and commit to its primary location in one way versus another. But instead we’ve designed this beautiful silicone, rubber magnetic tab that you can just slap on either the bottom for both vertical or horizontal orientation. The Google Home Max multi-room speaker is draped in acoustically transparent fabric designed to complement sound and interior decor. It can be positioned both horizontally or vertically, and two can be paired for stereo playback. So the user chooses according to their needs, rather than the speaker dictating its placement… Yes, we’re very much about making sure the technology fits into your life and doesn’t stand out. Technology is here to stay, so it needs to disappear or fit in with your environment. The days of the big black boom box are gone, so that’s why we used soft knit and picked specific colors. I read the fabric for the Home Mini wasn’t chosen just as an expression of aesthetics, but in service of acoustics. But I noticed while the Daydream View headset is covered in similarly hued fabric, it was not exactly the same. Can you elaborate about the purpose of these differences? We will never sacrifice function for aesthetics. And I don’t believe we have to be matchy-matchy. The designs are united by color, but also separated subtly by different criteria reflective of use. For example, comparing the Daydream to the Home Mini: the wearable has to be durable and keep light out, while the speaker has to permit light to show through the fabric and be acoustically appropriate. We picked fabrics accordingly. This is an example where we were challenged to serve function through form, serving each individual product while finding a way to unite them. The fabric covering the new Google Daydream View offers wearers a soft VR headset experience intended to work with Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2. My team and I believe in the tension of opposites. Because it’s not “either/or”. It’s “and/both”. I’ve been reading Janine Benyus’s book, Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired By Nature and I was left wondering whether the colors chosen by you and your team – Chalk, Fog, Coral, Charcoal – were the conclusion of trend research, or formulated using data connecting objects with our biological and evolutionary connection to certain natural objects? Does that seem too far out or a reach? No, no…that’s a really great question. My team and I believe in the tension of opposites. Because it’s not “either/or”. It’s “and/both”. We may have tried 98 different shades of white. And as a technology company, at first Google was like, “What? Why do you have to try making 98 color samples or 127 samples of gray?” But those subtle details make all the difference. It may not register consciously if someone isn’t naturally attuned to the details of design, and they may not be able to articulate those feelings – but colors have different vibrations in combination. We really spend a lot of time on that. One of the most enjoyable details was small and hidden: the splash of coral [orange] gracing the underside of the otherwise gray Home Mini. It reminded me of turning a fallen leaf over to find a colorful fungus growing on its underside or the inside of a seashell. It didn’t seem necessary, but it was certainly a delightful detail. You’re my model poster child! Because everything you’re saying is what we literally had to spend so much time defending. “Well, why does it matter if it’s underneath?” Oh. My. God. The objective was to surprise and delight. It’s surprising turning over a gray or white speaker over and finding a pop of color. We didn’t want to expose the orange on the surface, but keep it as an optimistic opportunity for discovery. Google has priced these products rather affordably, making smart home and even the VR experience, available to all. A lot of emerging technology is priced out of reach, and only the mobile phone seems to have reached that ubiquitous state where everyone, everywhere seems to use one. What’s Google strategy for serving people beyond the traditional affluent demographic and inviting everyone through the door? Give us some time. We’ve just begun. All I can say is that if any brand has their eyes on accomplishing this goal, and can do it, I think it’s Google. But this is a huge step for us to just be in the hardware business across this range of products and categories. But you’re right. It’s important, and we believe that everybody who Googles…everybody should have access to radically helpful technology that’s beautiful, and it’s on our radar for sure.","The Head of Design for Google Hardware extols the tension of opposites, the necessity of exploring 127 samples of gray, and why she loves her Panda phone.",2018-01-17T18:00:44Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Design-milk.com'}",How Ivy Ross Helped Change Google’s Culture of Design,https://design-milk.com/how-ivy-ross-helped-change-google-design/,https://design-milk.com/images/2018/01/Google-Productoverhead.jpg,,Design-milk.com,tension,1

""The knee is certainly an issue,"" he said. ""I want to point out she also got married. And it’s historically very challenging to race on the World Cup with a family or being married.

Jon Russell,"Reporting the news isn’t illegal, unless you’re in Myanmar. The Southeast Asian country this week sentenced two reporters from Reuters to seven years in jail in response to an investigative report that uncovered atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims by the army. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, the two Reuters staffers, have been in custody since December. They were arrested for possession of official government documents which had been given to them by a member of the police force as part of the investigation. That puts them in violation of the colonial-time Official Secrets Act which bars civilians from accessing government information. The landmark decision has been derided worldwide. Critics argue that the Reuters reporters are being made an example of because they surfaced the untold story of an atrocity that involved the military, which controlled Myanmar for nearly 50 years until general elections were introduced in 2015. The ethnic tension for the Rohingya in Myanmar has gained global awareness in recent years, but less is known about the role that the military has played in both escalated tensions and also through outright atrocities. The Reuters report which the duo contributed to detailed how members of the army, alongside Buddhist villagers, killed 10 Rohingya men in a coastal village. “Today’s appalling verdict has condemned two innocent men to years behind bars. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo face lengthy jail terms simply because they dared to ask uncomfortable questions about military atrocities in Rakhine State. These convictions must be quashed, and both men immediately and unconditionally released,” Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International’s Director of Crisis Response, said in a statement. “The outrageous convictions of the Reuters journalists show Myanmar courts’ willingness to muzzle those reporting on military atrocities. These sentences mark a new low for press freedom and further backsliding on rights under Aung San Suu Kyi’s government,” said Bill Adams, Human Rights Watch’s Asia director.","Reporting the news isn’t illegal, unless you’re in Myanmar.

Steven Melendez,"Google is still working with the U.S. Defense Department on an initiative known as Project Maven, training computers to recognize objects in images, such as photographs taken by drones, Gizmodo reports. That’s despite the reservations of thousands of employees who’ve reportedly petitioned the company to end its involvement with the military, with about a dozen even quitting over Google’s role in the project. Since Google isn’t the only tech company working with a Defense Department increasingly interested in harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and other sophisticated number-crunching technology, it seems unlikely this tension will go away anytime soon. A group called the Tech Workers Coalition has called on other tech companies, including Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon, to refuse defense contracts as the Pentagon pushes further into technologies like AI, robotics, and cloud computing. “The Department of Defense should not buy another weapons system without AI,” Lieutenant General John “Jack” Shanahan, the department’s director for defense intelligence for warfighter support, said at an Nvidia conference in the fall. Nvidia, the maker of powerful chips beloved by artificial intelligence experts, gamers, and bitcoin miners, hasn’t commented publicly on whether it’s involved with Maven. The Defense Department is also in the midst of putting together a multibillion-dollar cloud computing contract, which so far has proven controversial, not because of the power the technology would give to the military, but to the outsized benefits that could come to one tech company if the Pentagon signs with just one provider.","Workers have called on Google and other big tech companies to refuse Pentagon deals to harness the power of AI.

Bob Strong,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Tensions mounted over the fatal police shooting of an unarmed Sacramento, California, black man when a protester sustained minor injuries when struck by a sheriff’s patrol car that was under attack by demonstrators, authorities said on Sunday. About 150 people demonstrated in Sacramento on Saturday night to protest the March 18 shooting death of Stephon Clark, 22, who was gunned down in his grandmother’s yard. The death of Clark, a father of two, was the latest in a string of killings of black men by police that have triggered street protests and fueled a renewed national debate about bias in the U.S. criminal justice system. Protesters on Saturday night surrounded two marked Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department patrol cars and “began yelling while pounding and kicking the vehicles’ exterior,” the Sheriff’s Department said in a statement early Sunday. “A collision occurred involving the sheriff’s patrol vehicle and a protester who was walking in the roadway,” the statement said. “The patrol car was traveling at slow speeds.” The protester was identified by local media as Wanda Cleveland, 61, who regularly attends Sacramento City Council meetings. The protester was transported by the Sacramento Metro Fire Department to a hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries, the Sheriff’s Department said. “Vandals in the crowd” damaged the patrol car, which “sustained scratches, dents, and a shattered rear window,” the Sheriff’s Department said. Demonstrators interviewed by local radio and television stations, who prompted a flurry of similar Twitter responses, said the sheriff’s car failed to stop and called the incident a hit-and-run accident. The incident is under investigation by the Sheriff’s Department and the California Highway Patrol. Saturday’s demonstration brought together a multi-racial crowd, many in it holding signs such as “Stop Police Rage” and “Power to the People.” It was led by retired National Basketball Association player Matt Barnes, who grew up in the area and had two stints with the Sacramento Kings franchise. Clark was shot by police responding to a report that someone was breaking windows. Police said the officers feared he had a gun but that he was later found to have been holding a cellphone. Police have said he was moving toward officers in a menacing way. The shooting was captured on a body cam video released by police. In several days of sporadic protests, protesters have blocked traffic and twice delayed fans from reaching games played by the Kings at the Golden 1 Center.

Matthew Lynley,"More financing is coming in for Bird, this time potentially valuing the company at $2 billion, according to a new report by Axios. There’s not a ton to add here compared to the last round (which happened just weeks ago), as the same dynamics are probably in play here. While Uber was a bet on car rides and generally getting around, Bird is that but at a dramatically more granular level — thinking short hops of a few miles in congested areas. Startups that are exceedingly hot can sometimes pull off these rolling rounds where investors are coming in at various points, especially as the model further proves out over time. If you live in a major metropolitan area, you’ve probably seen Bird (and Lime) scooters hanging out on the sidewalks — potentially knocked over in a spot where someone might trip over them while checking his or her phone. That’s been a point of tension in areas like San Francisco, where Bird has had to temporarily come off the sidewalks as a permit system rolls out. Bird isn’t the first mobility-focused service that has faced regulatory challenges before, but it is one that’s become very popular very quickly. This too, as Axios notes, could be an easy play to get into a hot market that a major ridesharing company could want to buy its way into. Uber acquired Jump, an on-demand bike service, in the midst of its own financing round. While bikes don’t seem to be getting quite the hype that scooters are, Lyft is also planning to acquire Motivate, an on-demand biking network.

Mat Smith,"Now, 65 inches isn't the biggest TV at CES, or even at LG Displays showroom. (In fact we got to stare lovingly at a monstrous 88-inch 8K OLED in the same room). It is however, the only one that can roll itself into a box a fraction of the size. Like smartphones in the last few year, the bigger our TVs get, the more unwieldy they become: Many of these huge screens are a hassle to install / get delivered / move -- rollable OLEDs are one way to keep our screens huge and our door frames intact. Yep, it's still a prototype, but LG Display explained that this particular tech demo is closer to real consumer devices than the aforementioned 88-inch 8K OLED. Even at this prototype stage, the screen subsidiary of LG showcased multiple modes for the rollable. Beside the typical, full 65-inch screen, it's got a more cinematic 21:9 ratio option and a slender notification panel that can house weather info and act as a music player when you don't need the screen up front and center. Naturally, there's the viewing angle benefits, deep contrasty blacks and rich color gamut: It's business as usual as far as OLED quality goes. Once unfurled and upright, you wouldn't think this was any different to LG's on-sale OLED TVs. LG Display's spokesperson controlled the movement of the screen with a remote, and OLED display gently rose and fell. It wasn't quick, but it wasn't laboriously slow either. And, while it's still in demo stages, the mechanism that rolls out the screen doesn't seem to generate any significant amount of whirring or noise, either. Getting to this size from the smaller prototype shown in 2015 meant ensuring the screen itself was hardier and tougher, while still maintaining the flexibility needed to roll up. There's a lot more tension acted on the screen as you add inches to its size, so the company had to figure out ways to strengthen the slender layers that make up an OLED screen. This new disappearing screen is the fruits of that labor.

Jennifer Ouellette,"Enlarge/ Wine tears are due to a difference in surface tension across the top of the wine, resulting from the alcohol evaporating faster than the water in the wine.
1 with 1 posters participating
Perhaps you've noticed a ring of clear liquid near the top of your glass of wine, with droplets forming and dropping back into the wine. These are ""tears of wine,"" also known as wine legs or ""fingers."" Physicists have been intrigued by them for over 150 years, and while the basic mechanism is understood, new research indicates that shock-wave dynamics may also play a role in their formation.
UCLA engineer Andrea Bertozzi described her recent work on the subject today in Boston at the 2019 March meeting of the American Physical Society, the largest annual physics conference in the country. ""There's been a flurry of activity over the last 30 years, trying to understand more about this phenomenon, but nothing that really addressed the dynamics of the actual tear formation,"" she said. Adding shock waves into the explanatory mix ""would explain why sometimes one sees tears of wine, and sometimes one does not.""
British physicist James Thomson (elder brother to Lord Kelvin) first noticed wine tears in 1855, although they're technically known as the Marangoni effect after Italian physicist Carlo Marangoni. The phenomenon is also responsible for the infamous ""coffee ring effect,"" which has also generated much interest among physicists. It's most notable in wines (or other spirits like rum) with alcohol content at least as high as 13.5 percent. (That's because alcohol has a lower surface tension than water.) If you spread a thin film of water on your kitchen counter and place a single drop of alcohol in the center, you'll see the water flow outward, away from the alcohol. The difference in their alcohol concentrations creates a surface tension gradient, driving the flow.
Wine is basically water and alcohol, along with acids, dissolved sugars, and other compounds that lend color and flavor. The first step in creating wine tears is swirling wine to coat the inside of the glassa common practice among oenophiles to enhance the flavor. Thanks to capillary action the wine will start to climb up the side of the glass. Both the water and alcohol evaporate as it does so, but since alcohol evaporates falser, the alcohol concentration gradually decreases. This increases the surface tension of that wine, so more is drawn upwards, because the wine below still has a high alcohol content and, hence, lower surface tension.
Enlarge/ A drop of alcohol at the center has lower surface tension than the surrounding water, creating a surface tension gradient.
Tears form and gravity kicks in when the droplets' weight exceeds the force of the effect, causing them to fall back into the glass. Bertozzi drew an analogy to driving in the rain. ""You have water on the windshield of the car, and the wind creates a surface stress that pushes the rain up the front of the windshield,"" she said. ""And gravity is pulling it back down.""
That's the standard explanation, but some nuanced complications have emerged in recent years. For instance, a 2015 study looked into the impact of thermal effects at play (i.e., the temperature of the room). The study found that evaporative cooling is also a significant contributing factor to the formation of wine tears. The first quantitative study of the wine tears phenomenon appeared in 1992. But Bertozzi noticed that the equations typically used to describe wine tears didn't account for all the interesting physicsnamely, they were missing such factors as the balance between surface tension, the surface tension gradient, and gravity, or the curvature of the glass.
For her own theoretical work on the phenomenon, Bertozzi drew on earlier work she'd done in the 1990s while at Duke University, with experiments involving silicon oil on a wafer. The wafer was placed at an incline, so when the oil was heated, it was colder on the top and warmer on the bottoma thermal gradient, essentially the same kind of Marangoni stress as the surface tension gradient that leads to wine tears.
""Lo and behold, we were able to produce these unusual waves traveling up the plate against gravitywhat we call undercompressive shocks,"" said Bertozzi.
The surface tension gradient behind terms of wine is essentially the same underlying mechanic dynamics. To test that theory, Bertozzi and her team used port wine in a martini glass with a 65-degree incline. They observed a circular wave formingsimilar to the waves that formed in the silicon oil on a waferand traveling up the glass. ""Fingers,"" aka tears of wine, then formed because of the instability of the wave, eventually draining back into the glass. ""We believe such waves are some of the dominant effects when you see tears of wine,"" she said.
The next step is to partner with experimentalists to further test her theory about the complex dynamics of wine tearswhich may or may not involve imbibing a glass or two.
Tears will form in a glass of wine or rum if the liquid contains enough alcohol.

Associated Press,"(WASHINGTON) — Americans largely fear the country’s relationship with Russia and China will get worse in the coming year, and despite signs of diplomatic progress with Kim Jong Un on nuclear weapons, nearly half say the same about North Korea. That’s according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research that provides insight into the public’s view on the direction of U.S. ties with those key strategic rivals, 15 months after President Donald Trump took office. “Trump has opened up a whole bucket of worms, and he’s doing it with too many countries all at once,” said John Parker, 70, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. “It’s almost like he’s trying to get us into trouble.” The poll found that Americans are most downbeat about the relationship with Russia: 56 percent think it will get worse over the next year, while just 13 percent think it will improve. Even among Republicans, more expect the relationship with Russia to get worse than better, 40 percent to 20 percent, though another 40 percent expect it to stay about the same. Eric Brammer, 30, an information technology specialist from Roanoke, Virginia, who describes himself as Democrat, said he expects tensions to continue over Russia’s support of the government of President Bashar Assad in civil war-wracked Syria, where the U.S., Britain and France last week launched missile strikes against Syrian chemical weapons facilities. Brammer also said that if more allegations of Russian interference in U.S. elections come to light, it will sow more distrust among the American public and worsen the relationship. On China — with which Trump has forged cooperation against North Korea but drawn sharp differences on trade — some 48 percent expect relations to get worse in the next year, while just 17 percent expect things to get better. “The farmers here are worried about trade with China because of the soybeans, corn and hogs that all go there,” said Dorothy Jorgensen, a retiree from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, who expects relations with the world’s second-largest economy to deteriorate. “If one side raises taxes and the other side does the same, it’s not going to help either country.” As Trump looks to narrow the U.S. trade deficit, he has threatened to raise U.S. tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese goods to counteract what he says are that country’s unfair trade policies. That has fueled fears of a trade war. China has threatened to retaliate with tariffs of its own, including on American agricultural produce. But Marta Vicentini, a retired neurophysiologist from Miami Beach, Florida, said Trump was right to hit back against China over theft of U.S. know-how and trade secrets and predicted his strategy would work in America’s favor. “They (China) have no alternative but to trade with the U.S.,” she said. Vicentini also supports the Republican president’s approach toward North Korea. She said the imposition of sanctions is paying off and the young dictator Kim has been brought to the table by fears Trump will resort to military force and even a nuclear strike. “He (Kim) is going to grow up and mature and he’s going to realize that he’s playing with fire,” Vicentini said. Trump is planning to meet with Kim by June, in search of a deal in which North Korea would give up his nuclear weapons. It would be the first U.S.-North Korea summit after six decades of hostility since the Korean War. Despite the promise of the summit, far more Americans think relations with the North Korea will get worse than better, 47 percent to 20 percent. Republicans are more optimistic. Forty percent think that the relationship that grew increasingly tense last year will improve in the next year. Some 34 percent think it will stay about the same, and just 25 percent expect it to worsen. Outside of foreign affairs, 40 percent of Americans approve of the overall job Trump is doing as president, the poll found. That’s about the same percentage as said so a month ago, up slightly from where it’s been for most of the year. Fifty-nine percent now say they disapprove of the job the president is doing. Americans are also largely pessimistic about the state of the country generally. Sixty percent think the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction, though a majority of Republicans — 67 percent — think it’s headed the right way. ___ The AP-NORC poll of 1,140 adults was conducted April 11-16 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.0 percentage points.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP/GETTY IMAGES Image caption Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull with Chinese President Xi Jinping last year China has criticised Australia for making ""irresponsible remarks"" over the South China Sea in a policy paper. On Thursday, Australia raised concerns about the ""pace and scale"" of China's activities in the disputed zone - part of a wide-ranging document setting out Canberra's foreign engagement strategy. Beijing said the paper was generally positive towards China, but Australia should not get involved in the dispute. The Australian government played down the criticism on Friday. In a briefing on Thursday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang noted that Australia had repeatedly pledged not to take sides over the South China Sea. ""Australia is not directly involved in the South China Sea issue,"" he said. ""So we would like to advise Australia to abide by its commitment and stop making irresponsible remarks on the South China Sea issue."" Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the ABC she had received feedback from Chinese officials that ""they respect the stand we have taken"". What is the South China Sea dispute? Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years. Its islets and waters are claimed in part or in whole by Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Beijing has been building artificial islands on reefs and carrying out naval patrols in waters also claimed by these other nations. In July 2016, an international tribunal ruled against Chinese claims, backing a case brought by the Philippines, but Beijing said it would not respect the verdict. The frictions have sparked concern that the area is becoming a flashpoint with global consequences. Canberra's foreign strategy Australia's Foreign Policy White Paper, its first since 2003, is designed to set out the country's international strategy for the next decade. Among its key points, the document argues the US will remain crucial to Australia's security, but says Canberra must build even deeper links with China. ""Australia will encourage the United States and China to ensure economic tension between them does not fuel strategic rivalry or damage the multilateral trading system,"" the paper says. However, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Australia must also take responsibility for its own ""security and prosperity"". ""More than ever, Australia must be sovereign, not reliant,"" he writes in the paper's introduction.","Beijing criticises the nation for making ""irresponsible remarks"" regarding the South China Sea.",2017-11-24T00:28:45Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Beijing criticises Australia over South China Sea policy,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-42104814,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/54A4/production/_98886612_gettyimages-598991034.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tension,1
PETER BAKER,"Mr. Bolton has become the most critical driver of Russia policy, while the Defense and State Departments take a back seat, analysts said. Known as a Russia hawk in the past, Mr. Bolton lately has channeled the president. Asked about the Ukraine clash this week, Mr. Bolton offered no criticism, deferring to Nikki R. Haley, the departing ambassador to the United Nations, who previously condemned Russias outlaw actions. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, would not say on Wednesday whether the meeting with Mr. Putin would be scrapped. The president is receiving regular briefings on the Russia-Ukraine situation from his national security team, including briefings Monday, Tuesday afternoon and again today, she said in a statement. We will keep you posted when there is additional public information or any policy announcements on this matter. But lawmakers have raised the temperature on the president, arguing that his approach has sent a signal that Mr. Putin can get away with whatever he wants. Without a more meaningful deterrence, they warned, Russia may effectively claim control of the Sea of Azov just as it annexed Crimea in 2014. A bipartisan group of senators introduced a resolution calling on Mr. Trump to forcefully express opposition to Russias aggression. Instead of giving Putin a free pass, President Trump should announce new sanctions against Russia, call for the immediate return of Ukrainian vessels and crewmen, and call off any planned meetings with Vladimir Putin at the upcoming G-20 summit, said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island. Others said a meeting could still be useful, noting that presidents have met with leaders of hostile countries during times of tension if only to use the conversations to press for actions to defuse the tension.

Reuters Editorial,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and South Korea urged China to do more to “pressure” North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programs, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said on Tuesday, as tension builds amid a standoff between North Korea and the United States. North Korea has boasted of developing a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and reaching the mainland United States in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and international condemnation, including from its lone major ally, China. “China is currently implementing the United Nations Security Council resolutions (on North Korea), but China can probably do more,” Kono said after talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha. “We agreed on the need to put pressure firmly on North Korea.” The U.S. Navy’s top officer said on Tuesday said that vessels from eastern Pacific could be brought forward to reinforce U.S. naval power in Asia as Washington contends with increased threats in the region. North Korea has defended its weapons programs as necessary to counter U.S. aggression and sees the military drills the United States holds with South Korea and Japan as preludes to invasion. U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have exchanged bellicose rhetoric in recent weeks, with Trump threatening to destroy North Korea if provoked, while U.S. diplomats have stressed the importance of diplomacy. Trump on Monday unveiled a new national security strategy, again saying Washington had to deal with the challenge posed by North Korea’s weapons programs. Japan and South Korea are seeking to boost cooperation over North Korea, despite lingering tension between them over the issue of “comfort women”, a Japanese euphemism for women - many of them Korean - forced to work in Japanese military brothels before and during World War Two. The United States has also pressured China and other nations to cut trade and diplomatic ties with North Korea as part of international efforts to dry up Pyongyang’s illegal cash flows that could fund its weapons programs.

United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman (2nd R) arrives at Beijing airport after his return from North Korea in Beijing, China, December 9, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter North Korea also said in a statement carried by its official KCNA news agency that the U.N. envoy acknowledged the negative impact of sanctions on humanitarian aid to North Korea. Jeffrey Feltman, the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2012, did not speak to reporters upon arriving back from Pyongyang at Beijing airport on Saturday morning. “The United Nations expressed concerns over the heightened situation on the Korean peninsula and expressed willingness to work on easing tensions on the Korean peninsula in accordance with the U.N. Charter which is based on international peace and security,” KCNA said. Speaking at an academic forum, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the situation on the Korean peninsula had entered a vicious circle of shows of strength and confrontation, and the outlook was not optimistic, China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “But at the same time it can be seen that hopes for peace have yet to extinguished. The prospects for negotiations still exist, and the option of resorting to force cannot be accepted,” Wang was quoted as saying. North Korea is pursuing nuclear and missile weapons programs in defiance of U.N. sanctions and international condemnation. On Nov. 29, it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile which it said was its most advanced yet, capable of reaching the mainland United States. The United States and South Korea conducted large-scale military drills this week, which the North said have made the outbreak of war “an established fact”. KCNA said North Korean officials and Feltman agreed that his visit helped deepen understanding and that they agreed to communicate regularly. Last month’s missile test prompted a U.S. warning that North Korea’s leadership would be “utterly destroyed” if war were to break out. The Pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after North Korean tests. North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States and says its weapons programs are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.

Martyn Herman,"LONDON (Reuters) - Serbia’s Novak Djokovic reached his fifth Wimbledon final as he resisted everything great rival Rafael Nadal could throw at him to win 6-4 3-6 7-6(9) 3-6 10-8 in a two-day classic that concluded in nerve-jangling tension on Saturday. Twelfth seed Djokovic resumed two sets to one ahead after snatching a third-set tiebreak the previous night before Wimbledon’s 11pm curfew left the match on a knife edge. As it was for the first three sets the Center Court roof was closed and, again, the quality on display was sensational. Nadal grabbed the fourth set to set up a monumental 91-minute decider that Djokovic clinched when Nadal fired a forehand wide.

Seth Godin,"“Knock, knock…” That’s not a coming attraction. It’s an invitation. An opening. A bit of tension in terms of closure. A coming attraction, on the other hand, gives it all away. It says, “here’s a bit of what we’ve got, and the rest of it is just like this, but almost as loud and almost as shiny.” In the short run, coming attractions work faster. They get you a certain kind of audience and they lead to less disappointment. But the alternative, the hard work of creating tension and then delivering on it–that’s where our best path lies. It requires trust, not proof, and the patience to find an audience that cares enough to work with you to get to where they’d like to go.

WILL HEINRICH,"Schiele’s women are just about as violently objectified as possible. He often truncates or omits fingers, feet and faces. Daubs of orange and blue shadow in watercolors like “Crouching Nude in Shoes and Black Stockings, Back View,” 1912, look like bruises — though it’s important to note that in many of his self-portraits he treats himself the same way. (“Obsession” includes only a few of Schiele’s watercolors, but the Neue Galerie’s Klimt/Schiele centenary show, up through Sept. 3, has a whole wall of them.) But what interests Schiele in the body, in contrast to both Klimt and Picasso, is its sheer physicality. He portrays it as if it were a system of hoists and pulleys in constant dynamic tension. Arms and legs are stretched out like bowstrings between the anchors of their knobby joints. At his best, Schiele infuses every other aspect of a drawing with similar contrast. “Seated Woman in Chemise” (1914) shows a nearly naked model seated on the floor holding her folded legs open with her hands. Her egg-shaped, doll-like head is so idealized it’s practically inhuman, while the blunt exposure of her crotch is rendered as honestly and simply as the medium allows. Her overall posture is recognizably true to life, but a single hooked line runs down through her cheek into a heavily stylized clavicle — and lest you forget for even an instant that you’re looking at an artifice, Schiele puts his cartouche-like signature right in the middle. It’s an incandescent, unresolvable contest of fantasy and reality.","The Met Breuer’s exhibition showcases frank portrayals of female nudity from Klimt, Schiele and Picasso, all from the gift of a recluse who collected their artworks.",2018-07-18T14:40:36Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Art Review: Klimt, Schiele and Picasso: Erotic Visions From Three Modern Masters",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/arts/design/klimt-schiele-picasso-nudes-met-breuer.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/20/arts/20obsession1/20obsession1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tension,1

Anirban Guha Roy,"There was high drama in the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Thursday when RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son and Mahua MLA Tej Pratap Yadav called a press conference in the afternoon at the state party office. The presser was eventually called off as he did not turn up to address media leaving the impression that ‘all is not well’ in RJD’s first family.
Barely two hours later, Tej Pratap surprised many in the party when he tweeted announcing his resignation as the RJD student wing convener. He was heading the student wing of the party for past several years and was the final authority in deciding the candidates for student union polls in Patna University.
In his tweet, Tej Pratap also sounded miffed at the party’s leadership, saying ‘Nadan hain woh jo log mujhe nadan samajhte hain. Kaun kitna paani mein hain, sabki hai khabar mujhe (Those who consider me naïve are naïve themselves. I know who has what standing in the party).”
The reason behind Lalu’s elder son’s sudden outburst and bid to run down his party’s top leadership is attributed to the Mahua MLA’s failure to get some tickets for his close aides as candidates from few seats as against official nominees of the RJD in the coming polls.
Leaders said Tej Pratap, who had filed divorce from his wife Aishwariya Rai in November last year, has been putting pressure on the party’s top leadership including younger brother Tejashwi Yadav to accommodate two candidates, one Angesh Kumar from Sheohar seat and second, Chandrapraksh Yadav from Jehanabad seat as against official RJD nominees, whose names are yet to be announced.
Today, Tej Pratap, presumably miffed by not getting a favorable response from party higher ups and brother Tejashwi about his chosen candidates, decided to call a presser and announce their candidature at 2.30 pm.
The party’s top brass, having got wind of Tej Pratap’s plans, went into damage control and asked the Mahua MLA not to attend the press conference, sources said. It is said Tej Pratap cancelled his decision to face the media at the last minute and decided to stay at his own official residence after being ‘admonished’ by mother Rabri Devi.
But, the entire event not only embarrassed the party but set tongues wagging in political circles the elder Yadav scion continues to sulk at being ignored in party’s organisational matters. He is not happy with younger brother Tejashwi capturing the political space in the party as second-in-command after Lalu Prasad, indicating sibling rivalry between them.
On his part, Tej Pratap did not give any statement about his decision not to attend the presser but told a media channel that “he had asked Tejashwi and RJD chief Lalu Prasad to consider two names as candidates as they were youngsters.”
“I have been urging the party’s senior leaders including Lalu Prasad and Tejashwi to field young candidates as they would take the party forward. Yes, I want two persons of my choice as candidates and there is nothing wrong in it. It is not Tej Pratap or Misa or Tejashwi who form the party. Youths should get adequate representation in the party,” he said.
But he scoffed off the reports that he was planning to launch his own party, calling it as “a total rubbish”.
Evidently, Tej Pratap having hogged limelight once again for wrong reasons continues to put his patty in discomfiture owing to his unpredictable ways. He appears to be not giving up on his claim for a meatier role in the party like his younger sibling.
In the past, Tej Pratap had embarrassed his party by lashing out against party’s state president Ram Chandra Purbe for not appointing his close aides at the key positions in the party. He also had a face- off with party’s Maner MLA Bhai Virendra for seeking a ticket from the Patliputra Lok Sabha seat.

BRIAN SEIBERT,"Despite these differences, though, there is a sameness. Looking like a cross between contact improvisation and ballroom dance, the duets share a similar vocabulary of dips, bends, lunges, low lifts and smooth exchanges of weight. The dances have been thoughtfully designed to be appreciated from any angle, but this also gives them a certain spiraling amorphousness. A rubber-band rhythm of tension and release grows monotonous, and the otherwise appealing naturalness of the dancers is marred by over-insistent eye contact between them, an effect like too much mascara. The opposite-gender pairings tend to be equal and reciprocal, with the girl moving the guy around at least as much as the reverse. The same-sex duets are a bit more interesting, and although it’s hard to detect a meaningful direction to the sequence, Ms. Claxton does save her best for last: a meeting of the two men. Here, for once, the two dancers don’t gaze into each other’s eye smilingly or smolderingly. Their faces speak of more complex emotions, of a relationship with a history only partially revealed. Likewise, the emotions in the choreography are more ambiguous and potent: can’t live with you, can’t live without you. “Can I hide in you?” Ms. Joseph sings, and one man is rolled on the ground between the other’s ankles before their positions immediately reverse. It’s an arresting scene to come upon, no matter which show you’re there to watch.","A chain of duets by Janis Claxton Dance, part of Lincoln Center Out of Doors, has an engaging naturalness but a sameness problem.",2018-08-02T20:20:25Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Review: Those Touchy-Feely Folks on the Plazas?

Chris McGoff,"Peak performance cultures maintain a felt sense of creative tension. Peter Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline, says creative tension is the ""gap between vision and current reality. It is a source of energy. If there were no gap, there would be no need for any action to move towards the vision."" Creative tension can create better ideas and outcomes. This tension causes focus and a deep-seated desire to resolve the tension thus catalyzing heightened activity and maximum production. You can feel the sense of excitement and even anxiousness. Too little creative tension causes the organization to feel flat, compliant, and lethargic. Too much creative tension can take a sense of anxiousness to a point of anxiety. Peak performance leaders pay close attention to the amount of creative tension being experienced by their people and they know how to increase or decrease this tension as appropriate. There are three essential building blocks of creative tension. To establish and maintain creative tension there must be agreement on the following: 1. Current reality. Your people must have a collective understanding of the way things are today. They need to be brutally honest and recognize the absolute truth about their current situation. Shared understanding of ""what is"" generates a sense of authenticity and credibility. 2. Desired future. Your people must have a shared vision that moves and inspires them. The vision must be articulated in such a way that people are motivated to do whatever it takes to realize it. The vision is less about employees or the company. A powerful vision is about the world and the opportunity to help cause this great world you desire. You will need to decide what needs to change about the current reality to achieve this vision. 3. What's at stake. In addition, and critical to the establishment of healthy creative tension, people must be convinced that something important to them is at stake if they don't resolve this gap. Your people must have a shared and felt sense of consequence should they not rally and achieve this vision as well as a clear understanding of the benefits of moving ahead. Creative tension exists when the people of your company sense a gap between their current reality and their articulated vision.The gap created calls forth action.The benefits of establishing and maintaining appropriate amounts of creative tension are: Laser-like focus. Have you ever woken up at night plagued by thoughts of unfinished tasks at work or around the house? Perhaps you've had a nagging feeling after an argument with a significant other or a colleague about things you should have said and you keep replaying the discussion in your head. Your response to these loose ends is known as the Zeigarnik effect, named after Bluma Zeigarnik, a Russian psychologist and a member of the Berlin School of experimental psychology. Zeigarnik discovered that people remain unusually focused on aspects of their life that are incomplete. And they hold this heightened focus until the act is complete. This focus can help increase productivity and push you toward that desired future. Increased ingenuity and innovation. The desire to eliminate the gap and resolve the creative tension drives the people into a 'whatever it takes' mentality thus rendering them more open to new ideas and non-linear thinking. My consulting firm manages creative tension through complete transparency. Everyone in the company knows what and why things are happening. We acknowledge shortcomings and celebrate successes. Our leadership team has weekly meetings with senior team members, informal feedback delivery during one-on-one meetings, and monthly discussions with the larger employee population so our staff has a full sense of how we are doing and what is required and expected to get us to our collective desired future. Every employee, no matter their seniority, understands how their contributions and actions directly impact our ability to achieve our mission. This two-way dialogue and transparency helps our team stay focused and motivated. Walk through the halls of your company and take the temperature of the creative tension. Is it too much? Too little? Just right? Engage with people to see the degree of agreement they share in describing the current and desired future and what's at stake if they don't succeed. Through conversation, do what you need to in order to establish and maintain optimal creative tension.","Tension can create focus, heightened activity, and maximum productivity.",2017-11-30T19:22:18Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Tension in the Workplace Can Be a Good Thing.

Phil Stewart,"A U.S. withdrawal from a Cold War-era nuclear arms treaty with Russia could give the Pentagon new options to counter Chinese missile advances but experts warn the ensuing arms race could greatly escalate tensions in the Asia-Pacific. U.S. officials have been warning for years that the United States was being put at a disadvantage by China's development of increasingly sophisticated land-based missile forces, which the Pentagon could not match thanks to the U.S. treaty with Russia. President Donald Trump has signaled he may soon give the Pentagon a freer hand to confront those advances, if he makes good on threats to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which required elimination of short- and intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles. Dan Blumenthal, a former Pentagon official now at the American Enterprise Institute, said a treaty pullout could pave the way for the United States to field easier-to-hide, road-mobile conventional missiles in places like Guam and Japan. That would make it harder for China to consider a conventional first strike against U.S. ships and bases in the region. It could also force Beijing into a costly arms race, forcing China to spend more on missile defenses. ""It will change the picture fundamentally,"" Blumenthal said. Even as Trump has blamed Russian violations of the treaty for his decision, he has also pointed a finger at China. Beijing was not party to the INF treaty and has been fielding new and more deadly missile forces. These include China's DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which has a maximum range of 4,000 km (2,500 miles) and which the Pentagon says can threaten U.S. land and sea-based forces as far away as the Pacific island of Guam. It was first fielded in 2016. ""If Russia is doing it (developing these missiles) and China is doing it and we're adhering to the agreement, that's unacceptable,"" Trump said on Sunday. National flags of Russia and the U.S. fly at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow, Russia, April 11, 2017. Photo: REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov John Bolton, White House national security advisor, noted that recent Chinese statements suggest it wanted Washington to stay in the treaty. ""And that's perfectly understandable. If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing,"" he told the Echo Moskvy radio station. ""Why not have the Americans bound, and the Chinese not bound?"" GROWING THREAT U.S. officials have so far relied on other capabilities as a counter-balance toChina, like missiles fired from U.S. ships or aircraft. But advocates for a U.S. land-based missile response say that is the best way to deter Chinese use of its muscular land-based missile forces. Kelly Magsamen, who helped craft the Pentagon's Asian policy under the Obama administration, said China's ability to work outside of the INF treaty had vexed policymakers in Washington, long before Trump came into office. But she cautioned that any new U.S. policy guiding missile deployments in Asia would need to be carefully coordinated with allies, something that does not appear to have happened yet. Mismanagement of expectations surrounding a U.S. treaty pullout could also unsettle security in the Asia-Pacific, she cautioned. ""It's potentially destabilizing,"" she said. Experts warn that China would put pressure on countries in the region to refuse U.S. requests to position missiles there. Abraham Denmark, a former senior Pentagon official under Obama, said Guam, Japan and even Australia were possible locations for U.S. missile deployments. ""But there are a lot of alliance questions that appear at first glance to be very tricky,"" he cautioned. Still, current and former U.S. officials say Washington is right to focus onChina's missile threat. Harry Harris, who led U.S. military forces in the Pacific before becoming U.S. ambassador to Seoul, said earlier this year that the United States was at a disadvantage. ""We have no ground-based (missile) capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence... to the treaty,"" Harris told a Senate hearing in March, without calling for the treaty to be scrapped. Asked about Trump's comments, China's foreign ministry said a unilateral U.S. withdrawal would have a negative impact and urged the United States to ""think thrice before acting."" ""Talking about China on the issue of unilaterally pulling out of the treaty is completely mistaken,"" spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

Brandon Wiggins,"Kylian Mbappé, the 19-year-old prodigy for the French National Team and Paris Saint-Germain, has been one of the breakout stars of this World Cup, capped off by a terrific performance against Argentina in which he scored two goals and drew the penalty which led to another.

Players from Uruguay did not care for Mbappé's dive, and in the video you can see Uruguay captain Diego Godin grab Mbappé's arm as if he means to forcibly pull Mbappé up off the ground.

Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean actress is promoting cosmetics on China’s biggest online mall, in a subtle sign of easing diplomatic tension that has seen once-ubiquitous South Korean celebrities vanish from Chinese marketing campaigns. South Korean actress Jun Ji-hyun looks at a tablet as she arrives at the 50th Baeksang Arts Awards in Seoul May 27, 2014. The arts awards is an awards ceremony for the television and film industry in South Korea. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji Jun Ji-hyun, who has played the lead roles in hit movies and dramas such as 2013’s “My Love from the Star,” featured prominently on Monday on the product page of health goods maker Mentholatum on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Taobao.com. Jun’s appearance comes toward the end of a year in which South Korea’s entertainment industry suffered a drop in Chinese demand for South Korean cultural exports. The drop came as Beijing objected to Seoul’s use of a U.S. anti-missile system, prompting popular anti-South Korean sentiment in China. South Korean celebrities soon reported being unable to attend promotional events and having work visa applications delayed, officials at South Korean talent agencies told Reuters. “Chinese TV ads featuring South Korean celebrities were suddenly dropped and new ones aired with Chinese celebrities,” said a director of a South Korean talent agency, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, at a regular briefing on Monday, said he was not aware of any restrictions on South Korean cultural exports, and that “China will work hard with South Korea to promote the early return to the correct and healthy track of bilateral exchanges and cooperation.” Mentholatum’s Asia-Pacific headquarters did not have an immediate comment. Alibaba could not be immediately reached. In late October, Beijing and Seoul agreed to move beyond their year-long stand-off over the missile issue. “We haven’t seen any immediate tangible change, but we hope the agreement will have a positive impact on future cultural exchange,” South Korean entertainment and media firm CJ E&amp;M Corp told Reuters. The impact of the stand-off has been deep. K-Pop agency YG Entertainment Inc has not scheduled any concerts in China since July 2016. In its most recent earnings report, it said July-September operating profit fell 88 percent. Peer S.M. Entertainment Co has also not scheduled a concert in China since September 2016. Its latest earnings showed a 61 percent profit drop for January-June.

Reuters Editorial,"COTTBUS, Germany (Reuters) - Arab refugees and Germans carrying pro-immigrant and anti-fascism placards marched in Cottbus on Saturday to denounce what they say are attempts by far-right groups to stoke tension in the eastern city after two knife attacks by Syrian teenagers. “We want to stop this hate between Germans and Arab refugees,” said Ahmad al-Barqouni, a 28-year-old Syrian student, marching through the city with around 1,500 other people. “Some people made mistakes but not everyone should pay the price for it,” he added, referring to the knife attacks. Police beefed up security in the city of 100,000 near the Polish border, where the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party did well in an election last year. Residents and far-right groups will hold a counter demonstration later on Saturday against what they see as rising crime by migrants. Last month, two Syrian teenagers injured a 16-year-old German boy with a knife and a group of three Syrians aged under 17 threatened a German couple with a knife outside a mall in Cottbus. The attacks prompted almost weekly demonstrations by residents opposed to more people seeking asylum coming to their city. The interior ministry in Brandenburg, the federal state in which Cottbus lies, stopped sending refugees to the city last month. “We are here to make a clear stance against a rightist hate campaign,” said Lea Bunke, a 25-year-old German student, adding that the knife attacks by Syrian teenagers did not justify demands by some residents that all refugees leave the city.

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke She said Cottbus residents should be more alarmed by a rise in xenophobic attacks against refugees. ANXIETY The anti-immigrant AfD came first in Cottbus in last year’s election, beating Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives by appealing to voters angry with her decision in 2015 to welcome more than a million asylum seekers. Anxiety about immigration is high in Cottbus, as in many eastern regions in Germany, where older generations grew up under communism, having little contact with foreigners. Hans-Christoph Berndt, leader of ‘Zukunft Heimat’ or Future Homeland, an umbrella group that has been organizing anti-immigrant protests, said his supporters were protesting against the government’s immigration policy, not against migrants. “The media have been misrepresenting us,” Berndt said. “We are protesting against the decision to welcome everyone. There aren’t enough police, not enough kindergarten places and not enough teachers. We are demanding that Merkel step down.” Police on Wednesday arrested six members of the far-right National Democratic Party (NDP) - which Germany’s Constitutional Court last year ruled resembled Adolf Hitler’s Nazi party - who were handing out tear gas and flyers to Cottbus residents. The city’s technical university draws hundreds of international students each year, and the influx of foreigners and refugees has stopped the population from shrinking below 100,000 from about 145,000 on the eve of German reunification in 1990.

But everything about Ms. Kels costume seemed to be giving her problems that day. First, there was the layer of blue paint she had just lathered over her face and neck. Something was wrong, but she couldnt make any adjustments until the paint was completely dry. Well, she wasnt supposed to, but she did anyway, chastising herself the whole time. And then there was the issue of lip color. Ms. Kel layered Black Moon Sorrow lipstick, a bold, metallic midnight blue, with a coat of Evil Queen liquid lip, a black shade with hints of blue and purple. But the effect wasnt what she had intended. Nevermind. After some experimentation, Ms. Kel decided it looked good enough, so she put on her wig, and tossed the shoulder-length, smoky blue tresses with a small flourish. Imperfections happen. Such is cosplay. Her face freshly painted, Ms. Kel knelt by her bed and used an intricate web of zip ties to attach the inner part of her gold shoulder toppers. The zip ties wouldnt cooperate, so every time Ms. Kel stood up, beaming, the gold shoulder topper just slid down her arm again. Her headpiece, however, presented the biggest liability. Crafted from cardboard and Worbla (a brand of thermoplastic that can be shaped when exposed to heat), Ms. Kels creation had a wingspan that was almost four feet. She had to turn her head to walk out of the door. To complicate matters further, the headpiece quickly melted a line across Ms. Kels face, which meant that once it was on, she couldnt really take it off. (Thankfully, Ms. Kels golden scepter a tension rod that Ms. Kel spray-painted gold, topped with a piece of craft foam wrapped in gold fabric was ready for action.)","While the casual Halloween reveler might cobble together a costume the morning of, cosplayers spend all year working on elaborate looks and getting into character.",2018-10-29T16:49:52Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","The Best Costumes Are Handmade, Right?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/style/best-cosplay-costumes.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/fashion/weddings/29Cosplay1/29Cosplay1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tension,1
Sidney Fussell,"The Chinese government has banned all online sales of the Christian Bible, the New York Times reported Thursday. China’s biggest online retailers have reportedly already ended all Bible sales. Bibles sales are still permitted at Church bookstores in China, and some analyses or commentaries of the Bible are still sold on major retail sites like Taobao and Amazon. While China’s online censorship is well documented, leading critics to coin the phrase “The Great Firewall of China,” the Times links the crackdown to longstanding state tension between the government and the Vatican, which has historically opposed Communism. The Bible is the only holy text explicitly banned from being sold online, while other religious texts are still available. The Times report ties the recent move to President Xi Jinping’s “efforts to promote traditional values” and regulate the influence of both Christianity and the West. Presidential term limits were abolished in China, paving the way for Xi to rule indefinitely. China’s government has broad authority to regulate retailers and companies in the country. In March, Airbnb announced it would automatically, and without notification, register all guests’ information with Chinese police into a national database. Human rights groups have also criticized the government’s decision to ban burqas, saying it unfairly targets the country’s Muslim religious minority.

Justin Sink / Bloomberg,"President Donald Trump took aim at Saudi Arabia’s plan to cut oil production on Monday, injecting new tension into an already fraught alliance that has been clouded by U.S. concerns over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the ongoing conflict in Yemen. Trump’s efforts to influence oil production threatens to further strain relations between the two historic allies, even as his administration continues to describe the Saudis as a crucial partner in a shared bid to counter Iranian influence in the Middle East. But the U.S. president — facing pressure after Republican losses in the midterm elections — is eager to tamp down threats to the economy, including higher gas prices. In a series of tweets, Trump blamed a stock market sell-off on the Democratic victory while pressing the Saudis and OPEC to keep oil production at current levels. “Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!” Trump said on Twitter. Trump posted the message hours after Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said that OPEC and its allies should reverse about half the increase in oil output they made earlier this year. Oil futures had gained as much as 2.4 percent in London and 1.8 percent in New York after the Saudi announcement. Oil futures in New York fell 0.4 percent Monday, extending a record 11th day of declines, to end the session at $59.93 a barrel. Trump risks testing Saudi patience — or even provoking the kingdom’s ire — at a particularly vulnerable moment, with the U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran threatening to increase prices. The administration had been counting on Saudi Arabia to ensure oil supply to prevent a run-up in prices. The two countries have also clashed over the October killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, with the Trump administration reportedly considering sanctions on some Saudi officials in response. Over the weekend, the U.S. stopped its refueling support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Saudis said in a statement the decision to end refueling flights was a mutual one, and that the kingdom “increased its capability to independently conduct inflight refueling in Yemen.” And Trump isn’t expected to impose drastic penalties over the Khashoggi killing, saying earlier this month that he did not feel “betrayed” by the plot and reiterating his desire to avoid consequences that could harm the U.S. economy. Still, the president is likely aware that his statement could irritate Saudi leadership. His tweet posted just minutes after a Fox Business Network segment in which energy analyst Phil Flynn said OPEC leaders were angry Trump had “duped” them into raising production ahead of the Iranian sanctions. And the changes in posture by a Trump administration that had previously given Riyadh a pass on a range of international issues could prove an irritant in a relationship that has been carefully cultivated by the president and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The interference in oil matters risks overreach in a relationship Trump has leveraged to his advantage in the past. In June, Saudi Arabia persuaded fellow oil producers to end 18 months of production cuts and pump more crude in response to falling output in Venezuela and Iran. OPEC leaders made clear Trump’s social media posts were the impetus for the production changes, which kept oil prices low ahead of both the midterm elections and Trump’s expected move to reimpose sanctions on Iran. “We were in the meeting in Jeddah, when we read the tweet,” OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said earlier this year. “I think I was prodded by his excellency Khalid Al-Falih that probably there was a need for us to respond,” he said. “We in OPEC always pride ourselves as friends of the United States.” Producers need to cut about 1 million barrels a day from October production levels, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Monday in Abu Dhabi. The kingdom will reduce shipments by about half that amount next month, he said. This time, Saudi Arabia is urging allies to focus on the risk of rising oil inventories and forecasts for massive growth in rival supplies next year including U.S. shale. It’s a concern shared by Barkindo, who said Monday that the market balance is under threat from surplus supply and dwindling demand. “It is beginning to look alarming in the sense that the resurgence of non-OPEC supply — in particular shale oil from the United States — is putting a lot of pressure on this fragile equation,” Barkindo said in Abu Dhabi. A cut in oil exports by Saudi Arabia – or a rise in oil prices – does threaten to provide political ammunition to newly empowered Democrats who have long signaled skepticism of OPEC. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had previously supported legislation that would remove an existing immunity shield that prevents the oil cartel and its members’ national oil companies from being sued under U.S. antitrust law. It’s possible a more serious split between the Trump Administration and the Saudis could give new momentum for such an effort, which failed after former President George W. Bush threatened to veto it. Trump may also find a familiar ally in his effort to pressure the Saudis: Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia has argued that the oil supply excess is short term and has opposed production cuts, pitting it against the Saudis in an industry that dominates the economies of both countries. The Russian and U.S. presidents met briefly at a lunch Sunday in Paris, where Saudi Arabian issues were discussed, according to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. The two leaders are expected to meet again at the end of the month at the G-20 summit in Argentina.

Mike Fahey,"I wanted to be frightened of Cyanide Studios new Lovecraftian horror game, but the scariest thing about Call of Cthulhu is the sloppy stealth action segments that try to add tension to an otherwise casual adventure game. Back in 1981, when Chaosium first published the tabletop role-playing game on which Call of Cthulhu is based, the idea of twisted elder gods living in the salty depths of the ocean was terrifying. In those pre-internet days, occult ideas and concepts took firmer seed in young minds. Younger me suffered quite a few nightmares based on the work of noted American horror writer/racist H.P. Lovecraft, dreams where I struggled not only with hideous tentacled beasts, but the concept of inescapable encroaching insanity. It was heavy stuff. Daily thoughts from a Kotaku staffer about a game were playing. These days Cthulhu and friends just dont hold the same power. Why not? Whos to say, really. Perhaps the internet has given the nightmare prone among us a refuge from the dark night. Maybe reality has proven more frightening than tales of eldritch horror. Or it could be the fact that I can buy an adorable Cthulhu plushie from Target. Regardless of the reasons, the watering down of the Deep Ones lends a campy air to Lovecraftian fiction, especially when its as by-the-book as Cyanides Call of Cthulhu, out today for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. The game casts the player as Edward Pierce, an alcoholic 1920s detective hired by a wealthy industrialist to investigate the mysterious death of his daughters family. The daughter, an eccentric artist known for her disturbing paintings, lived with her son and husband on Darkwater Island, a remote whaling community off the coast of Massachusetts. Its like a Lovecraftian tale checklist: Deeply flawed investigator (with trenchcoat) Remote water-based location Run-down town filled with working class folks suspicious of outsiders Mysterious deaths that possibly corrupt local authorities rule accidental Tons of occult artwork Conveniently located asylum/hospital In the hours Ive played Call of Cthulhu on Steam, nothing unexpected has happened. The accidental death? Not an accident. The friendly locals? Not so friendly. Is there a cult on the island worshiping a mysterious and powerful entity that probably smells of calamari? Could be. Its down to Pierces keen detective skills to find out for sure. In order to investigate, Pierce travels to different locations on the island and searches for interactive spots in the scenery. One book on a shelf full of books. One photograph in a cluttered desk drawer. He might find a door he can open, or an item he can add to his inventory. Eventually clicking on these things will lead him to the next leg of his investigation. How well Pierce investigates depends somewhat on his stats. In keeping with the games tabletop role-playing inspiration, Pierce earns character points as the adventure unfolds, which he can apply to one of five statsSpot Hidden, Eloquence, Strength, Psychology and Investigation. Theres also Medicine and Occultism, but those stats are only increased through reading books or stumbling across artifacts. Stats also affect conversations with non-player characters. Having a high enough Eloquence might allow Pierce to talk a character into something theyd normally not do. As traumatic events cause Pierces sanity to unravel, even more dialog options appear. Call of Cthulhu likes to play around with madness. Different sanity states unlock as the game progresses, depending on what Pierce sees and does along the way. Something as simple as reading a cast-off book can have an impact on the mindset of our hero. As the narrative unwinds, so does Pierces mind, provoking odd hallucinations and enabling the occasional jump scare. I say scare, but again, nothing really too scary. Call of Cthulhu is mostly a casual adventure, the sort of game Id recommend to my mother, whose all-time favorites include Myst and the CSI game series. Things get a little creepy, but otherwise its a walk in the tentacle-infested park. Then theres that stealth action I mentioned. At key moments in the story, the player finds themselves tasked with quietly avoiding asylum guards or more sinister creatures. Suddenly the casual walking isnt so casual. Previously nonexistent tension springs to life in a most unpleasant fashion. The game attempts to use sound and icons to indicate whether Pierce is being seen by whatever is looking for him, but its a bit hit or miss. Ive had a guard in my face, only to turn around and go the other way. These stealth sequences (and later chase sequences) ruin a perfectly lovely and relaxing adventure game. Theyre attempting to get the blood rushing when the blood would rather just slowly slush about, as blood does. Seeing as some of the games more dramatic narrative twists play out perfectly well in non-interactive cutscenes, these sequences werent necessary. Without the sporadic running and hiding, Call of Cthulhu is pleasant little romp. It never gets particularly scary, but thats just fine. In a way, its an affirmation that childhood fears eventually fade away, and that which once terrified us can eventually become a cuddly plushie or cute t-shirt.

Adi Robertson,"In the first few minutes of Reverie, a new episodic science fiction thriller premiering Wednesday, May 30th on NBC, the protagonist starts ranting about smartphones. Mara Kint ( Person of Interest’s Sarah Shahi) is a former hostage negotiator turned college professor, and she complains that her students are living with their nose to their screens. “They get the whole world in their pocket. Is that such a bad thing?” asks her former boss, who’s recruiting her for a mysterious job at a tech company. “It is if they’re not developing the most important tool of all: empathy,” Kint says sagely. “We learn empathy by observing, and we’ve stopped doing that.” The speech could be lifted from an episode of the tech-wary TV series Black Mirror, and so could Reverie’s premise, which combines some of Black Mirror’s favorite near-future tropes. The series is set in a world much like our own, with the addition of a single transformative technology: a threadlike experimental brain implant that produces virtual worlds called Reveries. A small group of users let a company called Onira Tech trawl their memories and “social media footprint” to vividly simulate a favorite place, or even an absent loved one. The resulting virtual-reality reveries are the ultimate fantasy for some users, who can escape into perfect digital dreams. And predictably, some people are getting stuck there. Audiences have gotten familiar with this kind of cautionary yarn, where technology offers a lonely simulacrum of human contact. But Reverie’s pilot turns the idea toward optimism and earnest schmaltz — with extremely dull results. Reverie, developed by 2016 Mars miniseries creator Mickey Fisher, is all about cases of technology gone wrong. But the pilot suggests that this wrongness can be easily righted in a one-hour TV procedural format. At the start of the episode, Kint is stuck in the fog of prime-time-friendly quasi-alcoholism, haunted by a failed hostage negotiation that was personally disastrous. Then Onira Tech hires her to talk users out of their simulations, using her expert powers of empathy and observation. Kint amazes her handlers by blazing through a training montage of mind-freeing exercises, like learning to breathe under simulated water. By the end of the episode, she’s expertly tackled her first Reverie case. Rather than moralizing over Onira Tech’s invention, Reverie ’s pilot simply uses it as a framing device, like a wormhole that takes Kint to new mindscapes instead of alien planets. (“That sounds like a field trip to heaven,” Kint gushes when she’s introduced to the concept.) And while the show is ostensibly about the dark side of Reverie, it revels in idyllic virtual forests and other dreamy landscapes, even when characters are supposed to be trapped in a mental prison. These worlds aren’t even creepily saccharine, just blandly peaceful — a far cry from the action-packed OASIS in Steven Spielberg’s recent Ready Player One adaptation, or the virtual revenge fantasy from the Black Mirror episode “USS Callister.” For audiences who are used to artificial realities as a metaphor for sterile isolation or untrammeled self-indulgence, this approach is refreshingly idealistic, although it may well change in later episodes. But there’s a reason so few thrillers are set in genuine utopias. Reverie hints at some vague tension around military contracts and strange implant side effects, but the episode’s climax amounts to Kint running through a man’s family photo album, then telling him she knows how he feels. Reverie is also in the awkward position of depicting tech that’s futuristic by real-world standards, but basically taken for granted in science fiction. It translates ideas from shows like Black Mirror — or even real technologies like Siri — to the absolute lowest common denominator, portraying Kint as oddly amazed at the basic notion of virtual worlds and AI assistants. To their credit, the screenwriters mitigate the potential for corny science fiction technobabble by glossing over parts of how Reverie works. But that might be because the pilot glosses over every aspect of the story, from art design to character development and plot construction. Technology trapping people in their own memories is a quintessential dystopian premise. Straightforward bleakness in television is increasingly trite, which makes Reverie ’s apparent optimism fresh and timely. But the pilot, at least, isn’t written well enough to pair that optimism with real narrative tension. It’s too complex to be a fun, formulaic techno-thriller, but not smart enough to be an interesting commentary on technology. Reverie doesn’t come off as cheap or alarmist, but it’s completely forgettable.","NBC’s Reverie is an ultra-mainstream version of Black Mirror, a pretty but bland new way to stoke fears about technology",2018-05-30T17:59:55Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",NBC’s new VR thriller Reverie is a schmaltzy take on techno-dystopia,https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/30/17236448/nbc-reverie-review-virtual-reality-onira-technological-dystopia-black-mirror,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kQN1XyvfDKv-3GdCsP7DvismV30=/0x0:1000x524/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11448633/NUP_177887_1761.JPG,the-verge,The Verge,tension,1

Chris Welch,"If your Instagram account is public, there’s no real way to stop people from looking at your feed. Even if you block someone, your photos are just a private browser window away. That said, Instagram is at least trying to give users more direct control over their own list of followers; the company has started more widely testing the ability to manually remove followers with a few taps. Users with private accounts have long had the ability to remove followers and immediately cut off access to their own content. But an increasing number of public accounts have also gained the option to manually kick people out of their pool of followers. Reports of this new “remove follower” feature have been popping up over the last few months, and it seems to be rolling out to a bigger sample of users — at least on Android. An Instagram spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that it’s in testing. The company declined to provide more specifics on a full release for all Instagram accounts. Your feed is still a private browser window away Why might you want to remove followers? Maybe you just don’t feel great about old friends or ex partners keeping tabs on your life. Blocking and unblocking people essentially leads to the same end result, but this avoids the awkwardness of someone potentially realizing they were blocked — even for a short window. It’s less aggressive. Instagram notes that users you choose to remove aren’t notified about the action. That leaves room to stir all sorts of drama and cause a lot of “I could’ve sworn I was following you” from the person on the other side. In late May, Instagram rolled out a “mute” feature, which lets you continue following people while completely avoiding their posts and stories entirely. That measure is clearly meant to avoid tension with the people you know in real life. As my colleague Jake wrote, “You can’t unfollow a close relative just because they post 12 times a day, for instance, even if they really deserve it.” This time, Instagram is trying to give you a little more power over who follows you — without taking the big step of switching your account to private. Several folks at The Verge with Android phones (including myself) are seeing the Remove Follower function. To check if you have it, go to your own profile page, tap on followers, and then you should see an icon with three vertical dots to the far right of a user’s name.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Most Europeans believe their countries are more polarised than 10 years ago, and 47% see their societies as less tolerant, a poll for the BBC suggests. In the online Ipsos Mori poll spanning 27 countries, 66% of people in Europe felt their nations were ""more divided"", the highest proportion worldwide. Politics emerged as the main cause of tension globally, being identified by some 44% of all 19,428 respondents. Half of Britons cited a divide between immigrants and nationals. It was the source of social division most commonly identified in the UK, followed by differences of religion (47%), ethnicity (41%) and political views (40%). The worldwide results showed that three-quarters of respondents agreed that their society was divided, with one-third of those saying it was ""very divided"". Fractures were also perceived to be growing deeper, with a clear majority saying their country was more polarized than 10 years ago. Only 16% of respondents believed divisions were less acute today. The European picture The poll collected information from 11 European countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Serbia and the United Kingdom. Serbia was where perceptions of differences were strongest, with 93% of respondents saying their society was either very or fairly divided. ""All Europe shows a similar trend, with at least three out of four respondents saying that their respective society is very or fairly divided,"" said Ipsos Mori's Glenn Gottfried, who oversaw the fieldwork. Mr Gottfried said Europeans appeared to believe divisions had grown more pronounced. ""This could be a reflection of the political climate and a swing towards the right that we have seen in parts of the continent, or at least the political climate could be a result of people feeling more tensions. The two are correlated,"" he said. As in Britain, respondents in Germany and France most often identified a division between immigrants and nationals. Yet more traditional perceptions of social divisions persist, Mr Gottfried added. ""Tensions based on class and income still exist. In Britain, for example, about a third see tension between rich and poor, and in Hungary more people see tension between rich and poor than in relation to immigrants."" Media caption The Hej Framling! (Hey Stranger!) group puts migrants and locals in touch so they can go running together Serbia's haves and have-nots Dejan Anastasijevic, BBC Serbian Service About 80% of the population are Christian Orthodox Serbs, so there are no grounds for stark ethnic or religious divisions. But Serbia holds a record income-inequality among European countries, according to last year's GINI index measure of inequality. A quarter of the population lives below the poverty line, while the wealthiest 20% earn 10 times more than the poorest fifth. In the EU, this ratio is five-to-one. The gap between the haves and have-nots has widened over the last five years. Politically, there are sharp divisions over Kosovo, which broke off from Serbia in 2008. Accepting the territory's independence (without formally recognizing it) is a precondition for Serbia's accession to EU. But while most Serbs want EU membership, they also want Kosovo back. So the debate is always heated. Latin American rivalries Within the Latin American countries surveyed - Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Peru - at least three-quarters of respondents perceived big divisions, most often in politics but also between the rich and poor. Perceptions of tension are highest in Argentina, with 92% of respondents saying their country is ""very"" or ""fairly"" divided - and almost 40% suggesting it has worsened over 10 years. Some 70% of Argentines cited division over political views. ""That's very, very high,"" said Mr Gottfried. ""With the exception of Malaysia, in this poll Argentina comes on top in terms of seeing political differences as the most prevalent issue."" The survey suggests Latin America's political divisions were even more pronounced than Europe's, having been identified by more than half of respondents as a cause of polarization. However, while 68% of Europeans felt the divisions had widened over the last decade, that figure for Latin America was considerably lower, of 59% of respondents in the countries polled. Argentina's political rift President Mauricio Macri campaigned for office in 2015 with a promise to do away with ""la grieta"" - the term meaning ""the rift"" that described the deep state of polarization that had grown under previous left-wing Kirchner administrations (2003-15). Yet the rift, which is part of the everyday rhetoric of Argentines and is recurrently mentioned by the media, is far from being closed under Macri's Conservative administration - if anything, it may have deepened, given that almost 40% of people suggested their country was more divided than a decade ago in the Ipsos Mori poll. ""It is interesting how people perceive 'the rift' to be a recent phenomenon"", says sociologist Martin Gendler, from the University of Buenos Aires. ""In fact this country was founded on a number of dualities and rivalries that have been there since the early days of the nation, even more acutely than in other nation states. [They] have been reinterpreted and re-signified throughout the years, but they have always largely revolved around the confrontation of populism versus anti-populism."" A largely tolerant world? The survey also reveals some positive trends, said Mr Gottfried. Two-thirds of respondents agreed that people across the world have more in common than they have differences. ""Only a small number of people think that mixing with people from different backgrounds, cultures or points of view causes conflict,"" said Mr Gottfried. A third said those interactions can sometimes lead to misunderstandings but these can usually be overcome, while 40% believe they may actually lead to better mutual understanding and respect. Some 74% of Canadians said their society was very or fairly tolerant of people with different backgrounds or points of view, followed by 65% of Chinese and 64% of Malaysians. Image copyright MirekP 'Harmonious' China? Yuwen Wu, BBC Chinese Service While political, religious or gender divides might manifest themselves in fierce debates or protests in other countries, there is very little tolerance of dissent in China. Heavy state control of media prevents meaningful and open political discussion. As a result, social divisions are often papered over. Only 7% of respondents to the Ipsos Mori poll believed their society was ""very divided"". Former president Hu Jintao advocated building a ""harmonious society"", a fair and just society where rule of law was observed and people trusted each other. The slogan has been seen and heard everywhere. But when citizens find their postings removed from social media because they are deemed offensive by censors, they say ""my post has been harmonised"". Even so, the leadership recognises the income divide reflected in China's GINI coefficient indicating a high level of income inequality. President Xi Jinxping's ""China Dream"" to rejuvenate the nation has undoubtedly inspired many Chinese people - but it has certainly not worked out for everyone.

SEE ALSO: Scientists just named a newly discovered water beetle after Leonardo DiCaprio It's the insufferable, interminable drip-drip-dripping of a leaky tap. Well, scientists at the University of Cambridge have finally figured out what's causing what is almost certainly the world's most infuriating sound. Not only that, these clever clogs have also come up with a solution that could bring peace to all households. ""A lot of work has been done on the physical mechanics of a dripping tap, but not very much has been done on the sound,"" Dr Anurag Agarwal — from Cambridge’s Department of Engineering, who led the research — said in a statement. ""But thanks to modern video and audio technology, we can finally find out exactly where the sound is coming from, which may help us to stop it."" The idea for conducting the research didn't actually burst forth from a leaky tap, however. It was actually a leaky roof dripping into a bucket that inspired the research. Agarwal first decided to delve into this predicament after visiting a friend who had a leak in their roof. ""While I was being kept awake by the sound of water falling into a bucket placed underneath the leak, I started thinking about this problem,"" says Agarwal. ""The next day I discussed it with my friend and another visiting academic, and we were all surprised that no one had actually answered the question of what causes the sound."" Using an ultra-high-speed camera, a microphone, and hydrophone, Agarwal recorded water droplets falling into a tank of water. Per the research, the ""fluid mechanics of a water droplet hitting a liquid surface"" are pretty well established. Basically, when a droplet hits the surface, it prompts the ""formation of a cavity which quickly recoils due to the surface tension of the liquid."" This then creates a ""rising column of liquid."" Due to the speed with which the cavity recoils after the droplet hits the surface, a small air bubble gets ""trapped underwater."" Previous research has suggested that the ""plink"" sound could be caused by a number of things, like the impact of the droplet on the surface, the ""resonance of the cavity,"" or the ""underwater sound field propagating though the water surface."" But, until now, no research has confirmed what the source is ""experimentally."" Interestingly, Cambridge researches found that all three of these previously suggested sources are ""all effectively silent."" The source of the sound is, in actual fact, the trapped air bubble. So, how precisely do we put a stop to this truly repulsive noise? Well, researchers found that by changing the ""surface tension of the surface"" by adding washing-up liquid, the sound can be stopped.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption A Russian howitzer: Military modernisation is a priority for President Putin Russia plans to hold massive war games involving 300,000 personnel next month - its biggest military manoeuvres since the Cold War. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said units from China and Mongolia would take part in the exercise, at military ranges in central and eastern Russia. He compared the ""Vostok-2018"" war games to Soviet manoeuvres in 1981, which involved a pretend attack on Nato. A smaller-scale Russia-Belarus exercise was held in western regions last year. Russia has intensified its military training amid tension with Nato. Russia's military intervention in Ukraine in 2014 triggered Western sanctions and a heightened Nato presence near Russian borders. Mr Shoigu said 36,000 armoured vehicles would take part in Vostok-2018, from 11 to 15 September, and more than 1,000 aircraft. ""Vostok"" is Russian for ""east"". Paratroops and Northern Fleet naval forces will also take part. Russia's armed forces are reckoned to have about one million personnel in total. The scale of Vostok-2018 is equivalent to the forces deployed in one of the big World War Two battles. President Vladimir Putin has made military modernisation - including new nuclear missiles - a priority.","Next month's military exercise in eastern Russia will involve 300,000 personnel and Chinese troops.",2018-08-28T11:36:34Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Russia to hold biggest war games since Cold War,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45330161,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1AE9/production/_103198860_rushowitzerreut23aug18.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tension,1
DAN LEVIN,"But the production was troubled with delays and budget-busting costs. Crew members called it “Flaws,” and Mr. Spielberg — not yet 30 years old — worried he might never work in Hollywood again. “No one had ever taken a film 100 days over schedule,” he said. Especially problematic were three animatronic sharks meant to serve as the focal predator. Collectively known as Bruce (after Mr. Spielberg’s lawyer), they proved disappointingly unmenacing. And they corroded and malfunctioned because the young director insisted on the realism of filming in the ocean, not in a tank. Unable to show more than a few scenes of the film’s linchpin, Mr. Spielberg improvised. He filmed some scenes from the shark’s point of view and signaled its presence with John Williams’ now-iconic theme song. The result: a Hitchcockian buildup of tension and suspense. ( The Times review was a bit dismissive.) Even the production delays ended up helping. “Jaws” missed the traditional Christmas window, and a later release (and a marketing blitz) made it one of the first summer blockbusters.

Aristotle Balogh, formerly Google’s VP of engineering, application storage, indexing and serving, is starting at Airbnb in mid-November. Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk previously served as the company’s CTO up until January 2017 when he became chief strategy officer. Since then, Airbnb VP of Engineering Michael Curtis was tasked with overseeing all technical responsibilities. Now, with Balogh, whom Curtis helped select to serve as CTO, on board, Curtis is leaving the company. “Ari stood out as someone driven by mission and values, and as a passionate technologist,” Curtis said in a statement. “We’ve worked together in the past and I’ve seen his leadership in action. He’ll bring great experience and perspective to Airbnb.” Curtis has been thinking about leaving Airbnb for some time so that “he could focus on his family and other projects of interest,” Airbnb spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt told TechCrunch via email. “After discussing this change with Brian Chesky, they agreed that Mike would step down after helping the company choose his successor. ” In Balogh’s new role at Airbnb, Balogh will report to Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and be tasked with leading infrastructure, information security, IT, engineering for payments, trust and community support. “Im thrilled Ari is joining Airbnb as our CTO,” Chesky said in a statement. “He has a strong vision for keeping our community at the center of everything we do and every technical decision we make, and an incredible track record of developing leaders and nurturing an inclusive culture.” Earlier this year, Airbnb had an executive shakeup with its Chief Financial Officer Laurence Tosi leaving the company, following some reported tension between Chesky and Tosi over the future of the company.

ANA SWANSON,"ZTE has become a source of tension in trade negotiations between the United States and China. President Xi Jinping of China appealed personally to Mr. Trump to save the company after the administration imposed penalties in April that nearly drove ZTE out of business. The president’s softening on ZTE sparked a swift backlash from Congress, where members of both parties vowed to stay his hand. In recent weeks, the president and other members of the administration have met with congressional leaders to try to persuade them to temper their restrictions. The defense bill does contain text to expand the authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign deals for security threats, as well as bolster the system the United States uses to monitor the technologies that are exported abroad. Republican congressional leaders confirmed on Thursday that the House and Senate had reached a deal on the investment provisions. “This deal on #CFIUS is good news,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, wrote in a Twitter post on Friday. “The bad news? They had to cave on #ZTE in order to get it. So chances that a #China controlled telecomm will not just stay in business, but do so here inside the U.S. sadly just went up. #BadTradeoff.”","The ZTE offices in Beijing.

NIKOS KONSTANDARAS,"Ankara’s worsening relations with Washington and European capitals over a host of issues have led to more pressure on Greece: a sharp increase of immigrants and refugees crossing from Turkey in recent months, the ongoing detention in Turkey of two Greek soldiers who strayed across the border in early March and a series of confrontational military actions by Turkey. These all highlight the dangers that Greece faces as the European Union’s frontier state in a turbulent region. Mr. Erdogan presents himself as the victim of an attempted coup, allegedly by a United States-based former ally, Fethullah Gulen, and as the champion of Muslims everywhere, including the Palestinians. Lately, in the region’s fluid network of rivalries and alliances, Turkey, a NATO member, has cultivated closer ties with Russia and Iran while chafing against American constraints on its occupation of part of northern Syria. The drawing of battle lines over Mr. Trump’s recent actions could lead to greater tension among Turkey, the United States and Israel. Meanwhile, Greece’s relations with the United States and Israel have never been better. The U.S. Ambassador to Greece Geoffrey Pyatt, refers to the country as a pillar of stability in the region and make use of important air and naval facilities at the Souda Bay military base on Crete. The leaders of Greece, Cyprus and Israel held their latest trilateral meeting just last week, focusing on energy issues. Greece’s increased strategic value could work in its favor, as the country seeks American and European backing to keep Turkey in check and to help its own economic revival. However, the more Washington and Brussels lose leverage with Ankara, and the more unilaterally Turkey acts, the greater the risks for Athens. For Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose radical left-wing Syriza party is in a coalition with the far-right nationalist Independent Greeks, closer relations with the United States and Israel at this time could also create domestic complications. If the United States and Israel become embroiled in further bloodshed, such as that which attended the opening ceremony of the American Embassy in Jerusalem, the government will not want to appear too close to them. Several leftist groups are keen to prove they have greater “anti-imperialist” credentials than Syriza. Last month, after the United States, Britain and France carried out missile strikes against Syria in response to the regime’s alleged use of chemical weapons, Communist Party demonstrators in Athens tried to pull down a statue of Harry Truman. Even more ominous than the tension with Turkey is the possibility that Mr. Trump’s policy on Iran and Israel could drive a wedge between the United States and the European Union, especially if American officials carry out their threat to impose sanctions against European companies doing business with Tehran.",A march on the Israeli embassy in Athens to protest the U.S. decision to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem and to condemn the deaths of Palestinians killed along the Gaza border.,2018-05-18T04:45:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump’s Iran Move May Swamp Greece,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/opinion/trump-iran-deal-greece.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/18/opinion/18konstandaras/18konstandaras-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tension,1

She really is ""Back in Black."" Image: Maddie Meyer/ Getty Images The crowd in Pyeongchang, South Korea, cheered her on, clearly excited about her unusual choice of music. Though ice dancing has allowed music with lyrics since 1997, figure skating performances have been restricted. Per Vulture, this is actually the first Olympics where music with lyrics is allowed for figure skating. The International Skating Union's decision to allow lyrics didn't go into effect until after the Sochi Olympics in 2014. It's cool to see just how the figure skaters are incorporating this wider range of music into their routines, and Toth definitely embraces her badass side and shows us that not all women figure skaters have to wear skirts. Toth ended up with a score of 53.22, her season's best.

STEPHEN CASTLE,"Mrs. May has been making the case for a free trade deal with the United States and argued that Brexit was an “opportunity” to deepen trans-Atlantic ties and spur economic growth both in Britain and in the United States. British officials hoped that Mr. Trump’s visit would help that process. Instead the comments are likely to stoke acute tension within Mrs. May’s Conservative Party, following the publication on Thursday of the government’s plan for exiting the bloc, which would keep Britain tied to European Union rules on goods and agricultural products. Even before it was released as a white paper on Thursday, that proposal had prompted the resignation of three government ministers, including Mr. Johnson, the foreign secretary who had argued for a cleaner break with the European Union. Before arriving in Britain, Mr. Trump had described Mr. Johnson as a friend and said he might be in contact with him during the presidential visit to Britain, which began on Thursday and is scheduled to end on Sunday. Mrs. May’s new plan is designed to minimize the economic impact of Brexit which could be severe because the European Union is Britain’s biggest trading partner. But Mr. Trump appeared to side with pro-Brexit critics who argue that, by keeping many of the European Union’s economic rules, it would inevitably reduce the scope for a separate trade deal with the United States.",President Trump is quoted in an interview as saying British Prime Minister Theresa May ignored his advice on negotiations to leave the European Union.,2018-07-12T23:11:55Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Trump Inserts Himself Into Brexit Debate, Criticizing Theresa May",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/world/europe/trump-brexit-theresa-may.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/world/13trumpbrexit/13trumpbrexit-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tension,1
David Minerva Clover,"My official job title was telephone interviewer, and like all managers of people doing unglamorous work, management was obsessed with that title. They emphasized that we werent telemarketers, because we werent doing anything as dirty as sales. No, in fact, we would be using the power of the telephone for a greater good for science! My abusive boyfriend had pressured me into applying. I hated phones, but my job at the dollar store paid minimum wage. This job still paid poorly, but not as bad, and they promised regularly scheduled raises for anyone who stuck with it. Thats how I came to give surveys over the phone for a living, and how it ended up exposing everything that was wrong with my life. The call center was filled with noise ringing, but also the voices of the interviewers, each trying to sound professional and convincing. There were no headsets, only 90s-era office phones attached to big boxy computers. By the end of a shift, my phone would be warm from my ear. Work started in the evening. We called other time zones and went until midnight. We used fake names to protect our real identities. To stop people from slacking, everything was tightly regimented, and the computers automatically took it out of your break time if you were idle for more than 30 seconds. That included bathroom breaks, and it was common to see people running to and from the restrooms to avoid losing their lunch breaks. The rest of the time, the automatic dialer a program that generated random numbers and dialed them for us controlled everything. We had strict instructions to only let the phone ring three times before hanging up. The repetitiveness induced a dreamlike state. Then, a human voice would startle me. Hello? Hello! My name is Franklin Washington, and Im calling on behalf of a major cable television provider. This isnt a sales call, Id like to ask you a few questions... Most people just hung up. Company policy was that if they hung up before they heard the entire introduction, they didnt understand what they were refusing. Those numbers went back into the queue to be called again at a later date. The only way you could get us to never call again was to listen to the whole intro, then say Im not interested. That, or you could cuss the interviewer out. Then, rarely, I gave actual surveys. The surveys covered a lot of ground. The one on behalf of a major cable television network, which I was never allowed to name, included questions (all showing up automatically on my computer screen) about specific shows, but also about specific characters on each show. Then there was a survey about alcohol and drug use. I asked a series of increasingly invasive questions, about everything from your drinking habits to whether you had ever been homeless or sexually abused. They were looking for correlations, but I cant tell you what they found because we never saw the data. The worst was the survey on sudden infant death syndrome. For that one, we didnt cold-call randomly generated numbers. Instead, the list came from insurance companies records of people who had recently given birth. Thats right I called exhausted new parents and tried to get them to answer questions about their babies sleep. They were unfailingly angry at me, and I didnt blame them. Once, a woman shriek-cried at me that her baby had been stillborn, and I was a monster for calling her. Shaking, I selected the box for infant loss on my computer and assured her we wouldnt be calling again. Before I could process my guilt, the phone was ringing again. The rigid rules meant you could hardly say anything that wasnt on the screen in front of you, but you were also supposed to come across as human and friendly in order to keep folks on the line. Only a few people were actually good at this, and turnover was high. As the people I was hired in with started to disappear, I realized why the bosses could so confidently offer a predetermined raise every few months. Most people would never make it. At work, I existed in a constant state of tension, calling strangers who often yelled at me. At home, my boyfriends emotional abuse was slowly becoming less veiled. Sometimes we would have friends over, always his friends, and they would brag about particularly nasty things theyd said to telemarketers, and then look at me meaningfully. One night I called nothing but Hawaii and Alaska numbers, and half the respondents answered with a hearty Aloha. Another night, I had to ask an 88-year-old woman if shed ever been hit by a spouse or romantic partner, and I held my breath while she said Yes. I felt like I was going to vomit as I forced myself to ask the follow-up question: Had the abuse occurred in the past month? I heard the woman hold the phone away from her mouth and shout, so that I could hear her and so could anyone else in her home. No! Hes in a wheelchair now, so he cant get me no more! I had nightmares about her for months. Shortly after my three-month raise, the stomach pains began. My whole abdomen would seize up, and it would take all of my denial to get through the day. I had a performance review where a supervisor the same one whod conducted the mass interview when I was hired lectured me that my response rate wasnt high enough. I reminded him that he had always told us we couldnt control who responded and who didnt, and our best bet was not to get emotionally invested. He looked at me coolly and said: Doesnt matter. You need to do better. Then, one night I was giving a fairly benign survey about how satisfied people were with their health insurance. Part of it required that I take down each respondents employment data, and the woman on the phone said she was an archaeologist. Breaking the rules, I exclaimed: Oh! I studied archaeology in college! She was nice and pleasant to talk to, and the survey was long. While I was on the phone, I almost let myself believe I was having a conversation, rather than reading an exhaustive list of prepared questions. At the end, she said: You seem like a bright kid, Franklin. Youve got a big future ahead of you. I wanted to cry. I wanted to apologize for giving her a fake name. I wanted to ask her what the hell I should do with my life. Instead I thanked her for her time, and I hung up, and then the phone started ringing again. That was the moment the stomach cramps became unbearable. Buckled over in pain, I told my supervisor I must have eaten something bad, and I left. The next day was worse, and I couldnt make it to work. When I finally went to the doctor, endless rounds of tests only brought back a vague verdict of something stress-related. The fact was that a lifetime of untreated anxiety disorder, three years of living with an abuser, and three months of doing a thankless and freakishly stressful job had all caught up with me at the same time. I never went back, and it took me years to build a life that I didnt totally hate. But I still think about my time as Franklin Washington... every time I get a particularly annoying phone call.

Sean O'Kane,"Elio Motors showed off its quirky, highly fuel-efficient, and cheap three-wheeled car way back at CES 2015, but the startup has struggled mightily since. Today, it has received a bit of a lifeline. Online retailer Overstock.com announced that it’s buying $2.5 million of newly issued shares of Elio’s common stock. (Elio shares are traded on the OTC market.) The money will, in part, help pay off Elio Motors’ “outstanding debt and accounts payable.” Elio Motors also announced today that it will launch a token-based offering called ElloCoin in order to fund production, which it still plans to get rolling in 2019. Instead of an initial coin offering, or “ICO,” the company will launch a “security token offering” facilitated by JonesTrading, with the tokens only initially available to “accredited investors.” Elio Motors needs money — lots of money For a while, the pitch for the Elio Motors three-wheeler proved to be an attractive one. Around 65,000 customers put down a reservation, which cost anywhere between $100 and $1,000. The car, which the company just calls Elio, forces consumers to trade the luxury and convenience of a more normal-sized car. But in return, they get one that promised up to 84 miles per gallon for under $8,000. Unlike most of the other futuristic or environmentally conscious car startups that show up at CES, Elio buyers could still fill up their ride at a traditional gas station. Unfortunately for Elio Motors, it still ran into many of the same problems as those other car startups. The company had trouble raising the hundreds of millions it believed it needed for production, which led to a delay. At the same time, Elio Motors quickly burned through the cash it had raised. The company had mere thousands of dollars in the bank last summer with debts totaling in the tens of millions. Elio Motors had to furlough a “significant portion” of its workforce to stay afloat as it searched for around $100 million in funding. Elio Motors has a lease on an old GM manufacturing facility in Shreveport, Louisiana, but its lack of funding (and therefore lack of work) led to tension with the community there, according to a late 2017 investigation by Jalopnik. Despite the company’s troubles, that original promise — a small, cheap car with big MPG — seems to be what wooed Overstock.com into investing, according to the press release. Founder and CEO Patrick Byrne said he “was in awe” after just five minutes in the car. “I am confident that this will become my car for at least two-thirds of the days I drive,” he said. Byrne also said he believes in Elio Motors’ vision, calling the vehicle “a win for America.”","The company behind the quirky three-wheeled fuel-efficient car, which will cost under $8,000, has big debts to pay off.",2018-04-24T14:06:49Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Elio Motors gets a $2.5 million lifeline from Overstock.com,https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17274780/elio-motors-overstock-investment-offering,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgdPSRajeB7uARgWwnOCHE1wi74=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2916988/elio-motors-ces-2015-001-1020.0.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,tension,1
JESSE GREEN,"As written here, and as played so fiercely by Ms. Falco, Polly invites but also suffers from those inequities. She is so hard driving that she often zooms straight off cliffs of propriety, then keeps going on pure momentum and somehow lands safely on the other side. Whether arm-twisting the competition or lighting a fire under the patrician Corning, she is the model of the cynically uncynical type who makes no distinction between dirty politics and true belief. Whenever Ms. Falco is bringing these themes to the fore, especially in her scenes with rival politicians played by Mr. Fitzgerald and John Pankow, “The True” is riveting. It even manages a plausible eulogy for the lost merits of the old-style machine — in which, as Polly says, committeemen knew what every local wife was having for dinner “because we were eating it with her.” Mystery pensions and patronage jobs were not graft but a means of caring for widows and out-of-work neighbors. But in Polly’s more domestic scenes, with Peter and Corning, the play sometimes bogs down. (Though it’s just 105 minutes, it feels longer.) Mr. White wants to have it both ways with this ménage, not willing to step too far beyond the record yet using it to gin up tension all the same. That tension is somewhat bogus: Early on, Corning announces that he must cut off ties with Polly for reasons he will not specify. After much talk, the reasons emerge and are neither surprising nor consequential. Under the snappy direction of Scott Elliott, the actors pull this off — and, in one scene, an unexpected character even brings down the house with a stupendous cameo appearance. But the result is something of a stalemate: arguable as history, patchy as drama. I’m not sure there was any way around this problem. Mr. White, who writes for “The Affair” on Showtime, and whose two Broadway plays were a success (“ The Other Place ”) and a disaster (“ The Snow Geese ”), might have done better to break entirely free of fact so he could invent a much more dramatic story. And yet, the lack of drama — or rather the subduction of it — may be what’s most interesting here. It is, after all, Polly who has the gift — the gift we associate with certain leaders — of connecting to the emotion beneath the policy and the people behind the vote. (“A machine doesn’t care,” she says. “A machine doesn’t have heart.”) And it’s she who has the harder job, like Ginger Rogers, of doing everything the men do but backward and in heels. What makes “The True” worth its longueurs is the chance to see Ms. Falco bite into the unfairness of all that, but also the excitement. Love or legislation, it’s all back-room politics.",Albany politics in 1977 may not seem very scintillating.

ROB WEINERT-KENDT,"This bouncy charmer from the 1966 album “Blonde on Blonde” has been slowed down into a heartfelt plea sung by a young man, Gene (Colton Ryan), whose love for a young woman, Kate (Caitlin Houlahan), is not requited. Mr. Dylan’s original vocals imply a melody more than nail one down. “That happens a lot, where the melodies are often inferred,” Mr. McPherson said. “But when you actually go to the inferred melodies, they’re stunning.” Singing the exact notes, though, risks losing another element of the original. As Mr. McPherson put it, the throwaway quality of Mr. Dylan’s vocals means that the song “is not needy, it’s very strong.” Might a heartfelt, on-pitch rendition cramp that style? “No, because what he actually sings in the verses is so impossible to understand that it escapes the neediness — he doesn’t really seem to be asking for anything,” said Mr. McPherson, citing the song’s hallucinatory images (a guilty undertaker, the Queen of Spades, a dancing child). The space between feeling and knowing may be Mr. McPherson’s favorite spot. “That’s the way theater works for me,” he said, “within the tension that’s created between not understanding what’s going on and yet, at the same time, absolutely feeling you do know. Somewhere in that vibration is the great feeling.” To put it another way: Something is happening, but you do know what it is.","The playwright and director Conor McPherson playing his guitar at the Public Theater, where his “Girl From the North Country” will open on Oct. 1.",2018-09-11T14:02:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Plunder My Songbook, Bob Dylan Said.

Alison Green,"Editor's note: Inc.com columnist Alison Green answers questions about workplace and management issues--everything from how to deal with a micromanaging boss to how to talk to someone on your team about body odor. Relationships with coworkers can be tough to navigate. These are people who you spend an huge amount of time with, but - unlike most other people you spend a lot of time around - you don't usually get to pick who they are. And they might not be the people you'd have chosen to surround yourself with, if you did get to choose. Moreover, you need to maintain decent relations with coworkers because of work, which means that you can't always be as candid as you might be in other relationships. And you also have to consider internal politics, power dynamics, and hierarchy in a way that can make the whole thing feel tremendously fraught. That's especially problematic when you have to raise a topic that feels ripe for conflict or tension - like asking someone to stop ignoring your emails or talking to a coworker who isn't pulling her weight on a shared project. But with the right approach, you can have successful conversations about sensitive topics, even difficult coworkers. In working on my new book, Ask a Manager: Clueless Colleagues, Lunch-Stealing Bosses, and the Rest of Your Life at Work, I realized there are some key approaches that will make most tough conversations with coworkers go more smoothly. 1. Use the same tone you would use to raise any other work-related problem. Often when people are worried about how a conversation will go, their tone reflects that. They sound hesitant or worried, or they're overly delicate in how they approach the topic. But coworkers will often take their cues from you, and that that approach is more likely to make the person tense up, get defensive, or assume that the conversation has to be a big deal. Instead, try using the same tone you'd use to discuss a less charged work-related issue. Imagine the tone you'd use to say, for example, ""Hey, I can't figure out how to get this software to work. Any chance you can help me?"" If your tone is collaborative and conveys ""here's a work problem that I'm hoping we can solve together,' your coworker is more likely to respond in kind. 2. Sometimes being self-deprecating can make things easier. If you're worried your coworker will bristle if you ask her to change something she's doing that's bothering you, sometimes you can effectively reframe it as ""this is just a weird thing about me."" For example, if you want to ask a coworker to be stop loudly popping her chewing gum, you could say, ""Hey, can you stop popping your gum? It's distracting."" But that may or may not go over well, especially if the coworker isn't especially easy to get along with. You might get better results if you instead say something like, ""I'm sorry, I have a weird sensitivity to the sound of gum popping - any chance you can try not to pop it?"" The idea is ""it's not you, it's me"" - which while not always strictly accurate, sometimes get you the results you want without accompanying awkwardness. And if it doesn't work, you can always take a firmer approach from there. That said, this tactic makes sense in some situations and not in others. It wouldn't make sense to be self-deprecating when, for example, you're talking to someone about a serious work problem or asking someone not to make racist remarks. 3. Try to make things normal afterwards. If things feel a little awkward or strained after you have a difficult conversation with a coworker, look for an opportunity soon afterwards to interact in a more pleasant, lower-stakes way. If you can quickly follow up an awkward conversation with a more normal conversation on another topic, you can signal that you're not upset and that there needn't be any lingering tension. After an awkward or difficult conversation, try to find an opportunity soon afterwards to have a normal conversation with the person about something else. That will reinforce that you're not upset and hopefully will help to reset the dynamic so that there's not lingering tension.","Coworker relationships can be tricky, but they don't have to be fraught with tension.",2018-05-02T13:15:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",3 Tips for Getting Along with Difficult Coworkers,https://www.inc.com/alison-green/3-tips-for-getting-along-with-difficult-coworkers.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_503027030_355476.jpg,,Inc.com,tension,1
Angie Han,"It's not easy to make an entire room full of movie fans scream in terror. But John Krasinski's A Quiet Place did just that Friday, thrilling the SXSW crowd with impeccably crafted scares, surprisingly effective drama, and one hell of a satisfying ending. By the time the credits rolled, my hands hurt from clenching them so tightly. I let out a long breath I didn't know I'd been holding. And then I felt compelled to applaud, loudly, at what I'd just seen. Judging by the dazed looks on the faces of the critics around me, I wasn't the only one. This is that kind of movie. SEE ALSO: John Krasinski's 'A Quiet Place' debuts a TV spot during a not-very-quiet Super Bowl For the most part, A Quiet Place lives up to its title. Krasinski and Emily Blunt play the parents of a family living out their days in near-silent isolation, lest the slightest noise attract the monsters that have already demolished most of the rest of the human population. The film's genius is in the way it weaponizes that absence of sound. The quiet of A Quiet Place has nuances and textures – there's a difference in the silence a father hears as his family tiptoes around an abandoned store, versus the silence his deaf daughter ( Wonderstruck 's Millicent Simmonds) hears when she's in the same scenario. When sound does intrude, it's horribly jarring. My tension spiked with each crash or yell. When those noises attracted the monsters – which are so brutally efficient that they leave little more than a blood smear behind – that's when the audience would start to scream. Even more harmless, mundane noises take on an outsized significance. The roar of a waterfall starts to sound like comfort and liberation, because it's loud enough that the monsters can't hear over it. A song played on an iPod feels downright decadent, and almost unbearably loud. Dialogue starts to seem strange to our ears, after so many conversations executed via sign language. (The same applies, unfortunately, to the score, which feels unnecessary at best and overbearing at worst.) All this tension puts us in the same mindset as the characters: They can never let their guard down, so we can't either. Krasinski and his brilliant sound team even manage to turn our own bodies against us – I was acutely aware of my own gasps and signs, and frequently found myself covering my mouth so I wouldn't yelp in shock. Still, none of this would really matter if we weren't at least a little invested in these characters' fates, and here this cast does some of its most elegant work. A Quiet Place doesn't spend a whole lot of time dwelling on who these people are (if any of them have names, I don't know what they are) but the actors capably convey their characters' personalities in a few deftly sketched strokes. Blunt in particular shines, building an entire emotional arc out of an unguarded smile, a weary frown, a squaring of the shoulders. In essence, A Quiet Place is a feature-length version of that scene in every horror movie where the protagonist creeps down a dark hallway toward an unknown threat, and we grit our teeth with a mixture of eagerness and dread. Half the time, the payoff, when it comes, hardly seems worth the fuss. A Quiet Place is the all-too-rare movie where it does. This may not be the deepest or most ambitious horror movie in recent memory – there's not much here beyond that brilliantly simple core concept. But as a delivery vehicle for sheer, visceral terror, it's one of the most brutally effective.","It's not easy to make an entire room full of movie fans scream in terror.

Cory Doctorow,"Sam Peltzman proposed a model of regulation where the profitability of firms is in tension with their customers' desire for low prices and politicians' desire to get votes. In Peltzman's model, companies can get politicians off their backs -- or get them to institute anti-competitive policies that benefit them -- by bribing them with campaign contributions, but the limit on this is that voters will eventually publish politicians for letting companies rip them off. Politicians look for ways to regulate monopolies that diverts some of their profits to key constituents, keeping the threshold of profit-diversion to a point where the monopolist can still bank large profits. In the case of Facebook, voters are worried about the costs in privacy, not cash, and the model predicts that Facebook will amp up its Congressional campaign funding and also to create programs that enrich key constituents in key electors' constituencies. Who will be subsidized? Be sure to watch the key players as there is plenty to go around and the money has only begun to flow but aside from campaign funds look for rules, especially in the political sphere, that will raise the costs of advertising to challengers relative to incumbents. Incumbents love incumbency advantage. Also watch out for a deal where the government limits profit regulation in return for greater government access to Facebook data including by the NSA, ICE, local and even foreign police. Keep in mind that politicians don’t really want privacy–remember that in 2016 Congress also held hearings on privacy and technology. Only those hearings were about how technology companies kept their user data too private.

CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and JESS BIDGOOD,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A statewide teacher strike in West Virginia entered its seventh day on Friday, with teachers defying efforts by the state’s governor and union leaders to end the walkout with a deal to raise pay. Earlier this week, James C. Justice, the governor, announced a plan to raise teachers’ salaries by 5 percent, and state union leaders said teachers would return to work on Thursday. But teachers across the state have refused, saying they will not return until the State Legislature completes the deal, and counties across the state have kept schools closed. Wearing red T-shirts, often emblazoned with the names of their counties, the teachers filled the chambers of the State Senate on Friday morning and filled the hallways and rotunda of the Capitol, chanting, “We’re not leaving.” “At this point everybody’s still prepared to be out for the long haul,” said Julie Alderman, 35, a first-grade teacher in Logan County, in the state’s southern section, who was waiting for a babysitter to arrive so she could head to Charleston, the capital. “We’re starting to kind of say, ‘Wow, this really may last a while.’” The walkout began last Thursday after months of simmering tension over myriad issues, including proposed changes to teachers’ health insurance plans that would have raised monthly premiums for many.

JOHN OTIS,"Ms. Horne says that she has always felt more like a boy. She came out as gay in her early teens, which brought tension with her father and her brother, she said, though her mother has been supportive. Her peers were also not accepting, leaving Ms. Horne in a state of perpetual unease. Later, she revealed to her family that she was struggling with her gender identity. Last year, she enrolled at Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service, a transfer school for students who are falling short of the credits they need to graduate. There, Ms. Horne counts classes on film, Italian and English language arts among her favorites. The school is a joint venture between New York City’s Education Department and Brooklyn Community Services, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Ms. Horne says she is now in a place with others who are accustomed to strife, both in school and at home. And she has come to feel like less of a misfit. “Everybody gets it,” Ms. Horne said. “Everybody knows that people are struggling through something.” For more than a year, she has been attending weekly therapy sessions. Ms. Horne says her therapist is the only person she confides in. “I don’t care if I have to wait a whole week to tell her about what happened last week,” she said. In the spring, she left a homeless shelter where she was living with her mother to spend a couple months in a shelter for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. When she moved back into the previous shelter, where she lives today, she discovered many of her belongings had been thrown away. Brooklyn Community Services used $500 from the Neediest Cases Fund so Ms. Horne, who receives $397 in food stamps every month, could buy new clothing.

George Dvorsky,"During sex, female praying mantises have a tendency to kill their partners with a decapitating cutting blow that would make a samurai proud. But as this shocking new video shows, just because a male doesn’t have a head doesn’t mean he still can’t get it on. The entirety of this gorgeous new Deep Look video about praying mantises is worth watching, but the nasty business starts around the 3:00 mark. The female chops off the male’s head during the courting stage, but like the horny insectoid zombie that it is, the male—sans head—continues to mate with the female, mounting her and delivering the sperm that will fertilize her eggs. As explained in the video, the male’s body is still being controlled by nerves in its abdomen, and “it can still get the job done.” Biologists refer to this behavior as sexual cannibalism, and the mantis female doesn’t do this out of spite or as some kind of mindlessly random act. A State University of New York-Fredonia paper from last year showed that males who get consumed by their mates are actually at a reproductive advantage. From a “selfish gene” perspective, this is actually good news for the mantis dude. As the study showed, females who eat their partners are able to produce more than twice the number of eggs than those who don’t. Of course, males who survive mating could produce multiple times with other partners, so clearly there’s some evolutionary tension here. As this video shows, biology is messy, and it’s never satisfied with a single approach to survival.

CORAL DAVENPORT,"The White House memo notes that multiple scientific and defense reports have recently concluded that climate change poses a significant threat to national security, but it casts doubt on those reports, saying, these scientific and national security judgments have not undergone a rigorous independent and adversarial peer review to examine the certainties and uncertainties of climate science, as well as implications for national security. 
Earlier this month, the director of national intelligence released its 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment, which concluded that Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond. Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security.
The report listed specific threats posed by climate change, such as the threat of rising sea levels to the safety of low-lying military installations and the likelihood that increased drought and flooding could lead to mass human displacement and increased conflict. The report concluded that climate-driven food shortages could increase the risk of social unrest, migration, and interstate tension in countries such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq and Jordan.

The statement was unusual not only because the team did not have any recent history of protests during the anthem, but also because nobody had even asked the coach about the issue. On Saturday, he addressed his teams protest in a different way.
This was all about the hate groups that came to our community and tried to spread racism and bigotry in our community, Davis said. This created a lot of tension for our campus.

Reuters,"Wikipedia Tension in the South China Sea will hurt PetroVietnam's offshore exploration and exploitation activities this year, the state-run oil and gas group said on Tuesday. Vietnam and China have been embroiled in maritime disputes in parts of the busy waterway, where China claims 90 percent of the potentially energy-rich maritime territory. PetroVietnam has rarely openly admitted that the tension has had an adverse impact on its offshore exploration and production fields. HANOI (Reuters) - Tension in the South China Sea will hurt PetroVietnam's offshore exploration and exploitation activities this year, the state-run oil and gas group said on Tuesday, weeks after the Southeast Asian nation suspended a project under pressure from China. Vietnam and China have been embroiled in maritime disputes in parts of the busy waterway, where China claims 90 percent of the potentially energy-rich maritime territory, which Vietnam calls the East Sea. ""The East Sea is forecast to continue to have uncertainty this year... affecting the company's efforts to attract foreign investors to invest in its open offshore fields"", PetroVietnam said on its website. PetroVietnam has rarely openly admitted that the tension has had an adverse impact on its offshore exploration and production fields, especially those located near the U-shaped ""nine-dash line"" that marks the vast area claimed by China. During a trip to Hanoi on Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said both nations should settle their disputes in the South China Sea through talks and move to jointly use its waters. The two countries had agreed such a move was ""extremely important for the healthy and sustainable development of bilateral relations,"" Wang said. In its statement, PetroVietnam said the dispute with China would add to its struggle to maintain crude oil output amid already declining production from Vietnam's key fields. Last month, it ordered Spanish energy firm Repsol to suspend its ""Red Emperor"" project off Vietnam's southeastern coast following pressure from China, sources told Reuters. The $1-billion ""Red Emperor"" field is of moderate size by international standards but was seen as a key asset to help slow the decline of Vietnam's stalling oil and gas production. But the block lies near China's ""nine-dash line"" and overlaps what it says are its own oil concessions. Vietnam's crude oil output this year is expected to fall 14.7 percent from last year to 11.31 million metric tonnes, or 227,130 barrels per day, the government has said.","Wikipedia Tension in the South China Sea will hurt PetroVietnam's offshore exploration and exploitation activities this year, the state-run oil and gas group said on Tuesday.

JON CARAMANICA,"As music, it is onerous agitpop an egregious case of bothsidesism. As video, its unintentionally comic, mawkish passing for sober. Throughout the clip, the tension grows; the white man stands up and hovers over his counterpart, pointing and yelling. Eventually, the black man stands up, flips the table, knocks the MAGA hat off his sparring partners head. It seems like there will be resolution, that the guy who insists hes not racist will finally come to the realization that he is. But then the men face each other and hug, a hilarious conclusion that pretends problems can be solved by simply airing grievances, not addressing them. It feels antiquated and childishly hopeful, as if it had been released in a less tumultuous time like, say, the early 2010s.
Both of these videos are premised on the anxiety thats born of systemic misunderstanding, confrontation and racism. For a recalibration of that dynamic, there is Apes**t, the audacious Jay-Z and Beyoncé video filmed in the Louvre, which proposes that black beauty and creativity belong in museums, too, and that no exclusively white space should remain that way.
It is a lavish affair, aesthetically and conceptually, energized by the fact that, on a basic level, the art on the Louvre walls is static, but the performers in the space are not.

Jonathan Shieber,"Brud, the actual company behind one of Instagram’s most popular virtual influencers (it’s a thing), has raised millions of dollars from Silicon Valley investors because this is 2018 and everything is awful. Last week, the Los Angeles-based startup led by Trevor McFedries, outed itself as the collective consciousness behind the virtual celebrity Lil Miquela and her less well known contemporaries Blawko22 and BermudaisBae in a choreographed melodrama worthy of Los Angeles’ best reality television. The subject of numerous glowing profiles in online and print fashion and lifestyle magazines (including, most recently, in High Snobiety ), Lil Miquela’s stardom (and her fellow avatars) fascinated because the characters’ creators coyly toed the line around “her” self-awareness and their own. In the process, they created a sensation that’s become well-known worldwide. It’s less well-known that the company is backed by some of the biggest names in venture capital investment — firms like Sequoia Capital. Our sources put the company’s funding somewhere around $6 million in its recent funding round. There are other notable investors from Silicon Valley and New York rumored to be in the round — like New York’s BoxGroup and the Bay Area’s SV Angel. Sequoia declined to comment for this article and Box Group’s David Tisch did not respond to a request for comment. All of the virtual drama with Miquela started late last week when news outlets ( including TechCrunch ) reported that Miquela’s Instagram account (or that of her handlers) was hacked by operators of a social media account belonging to another virtual personality known as “Bermudaisbae” (a more right wing social media persona with fewer followers). McFedries, brud ‘s founder and chief executive, confirmed that the Miquela account had been hacked in a text exchange with me, writing, “some redditor idiots hacked the page we think.” That was a lie. The account “hack” was architected by brud as part of an ongoing virtual reality drama playing out on Instagram and other social media platforms between avatars it had developed, all designed to attract media attention, according to people with knowledge of brud and its plans. It worked. McFedries has not responded to further requests for comment after confirming that the Miquela account was “good”. One Los Angeles investor familiar with the company said brud was “using conflict to introduce new characters… same as the Kardashians always have.” The investor added that two years into the development of the Miquela persona, brud ‘s founders knew that the fad could lose some of its luster as the is-she-or-Isn’t-she-real tension dissipates under the weight of continuously thwarted expectations — like a post-modern twist on the will-or-won’t-they dramatic tension defining most sitcoms since Cheers. “People aren’t going to buy that she’s human so they make it seem as if she’s had an existential crisis and now she is the first in a breed of conscious AR characters that they will build a world around,” this investor wrote. “[Manufacturing] social influence.” Blawko22 and Lil Miquela imposed over a gas station exterior simulating a pit stop on the road to Coachella For his part, the 33-yar-old McFedries had been manufacturing social influence in Los Angeles through his talents as a dj, producer and director before entering the startup world. First under the name of DJ Skeet Skeet and then as DJ Skeeter, and, finally, Yung Skeeter, McFedries has worked or performed with a number of the world’s best selling recording artists including Chris Brown, Ke$ha, and Katy Perry (and — interestingly — more obscure acts like Bonde do Role ). Working as an an “artist advocate” for Spotify, a DJ for a radio show on iHeartRadio, and as a spokesman for VitaminWater sustained McFedries along with managing the career of BANKS and executive producing her first album and a single on Azealia Banks’ 2014 record “Broke with Expensive Taste” — at least according to a Wikipedia page on Yung Skeeter. Around this time McFedries also began investing in companies, according to AngelList. Roughly two years after the Banks record release, Lil Miquela made her first appearance on Instagram. And the rest is history as written in Internet archives and memes. Ephemeral, but infinite. The project that brud seems to be pursuing — turning celebrity into a virtual commodity; commenting on the unreality of the “real” entertainment industry by literally creating an unreal celebrity — is fascinating. There’s certainly a valid criticism to be made about the ways in which celebrity operates, the ways in which our “social” media has corroded society, and the unbridled power of these platforms to transform messengers and their messages into movements. Perhaps brud wants to make these critiques through its very existence — or at least use its low-brow as high-brow (or is it vice versa? ) intellectual appeal as a veneer over the more crass (but potentially honest) mission of selling more shit more effectively through the use of spokespeople whose views only change when their creators want them to (it worked for Hollywood’s star system ). That at least gets sponsors and advertisers out of the potentially messy situations that can come from working with spokespeople whose actions can’t be controlled by software — or an ingenious marketing team. In the High Snobiety profile-as-honors-senior-English-thesis on Lil Miquela published yesterday, the avatar’s own spokesperson was quoted as saying: “The internet is endlessly powerful, and that power has been wielded in many ways. It feels like we’re not going to put the genie back in the bottle, so we’ve got to learn how to leverage these tools in positive ways. I’ve used my platform to raise real money for important organizations throughout LA and I’ve seen lives changed as a result. I think the only chance we’ve got is to collectively teach our loved ones how to think critically and how to spot misinformation.

RORY SMITH,"Of course, it is easy to say that after the group stage of a World Cup. The pattern of the tournament is familiar, and yet somehow forgotten, every four years. The first round of group games is cagey, cautious; everyone worries that this year’s competition will be the worst in history. In the second, teams cut loose. By the third, when the stakes are highest, and it is do or die, mayhem ensues, favorites tumble, and enthusiasm peaks. It rarely, if ever, lasts. Partly, that is a matter of perspective: It is hard to see how the knockout rounds, this year, can possibly surpass the adventures of Argentina, Spain and Germany for drama, no matter how compelling they are. And partly, it is natural, unavoidable, a consequence of the shifting nature of the competition. For the first two weeks, the World Cup is a carnival. The planet is captivated by the color and the noise and the bravado of some of the less familiar nations: the buccaneering spirit and boisterous support of Peru; the pride and joy of Panama; the technical accomplishment, and the rotten luck, of Morocco and Iran. After that, the tournament becomes what it is meant to be: a competition. The tension sets in. The incentives change. For much of the group stage, there is a premium on winning. It pays to attack, to score goals, to cast off any fear and go for the throat. The knockout rounds are different. Now, all of a sudden, the vital thing is not to lose. That fundamentally alters the experience, for players and for viewers. After all the unpredictability of the past two weeks, there is a startling familiarity to the last 16 (apart from the absence of Germany). Of the 16 teams still standing, 10 are from Europe. Four are from South America, because Argentina and Colombia rallied. That leaves just Mexico and Japan from outside the two historically dominant confederations.","The carnival spirit and upsets of the World Cup’s group stage rarely continue in the knockout rounds, but international soccer is more democratic than ever.",2018-06-29T09:00:14Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On Soccer: This Is When the World Cup Surprises End.

JOSEPH BERGER,"The entire process had to be completed in barely three weeks of Yiddish coaching and four weeks of rehearsals. The first preview was July 4; the show is scheduled to run through Sept. 2. If a standing ovation at a packed preview on Monday night was any measure, audiences seem to relish the result. For one thing, English and Russian translations are projected on two panels flanking the stage, so those who don’t speak Yiddish can follow along easily. And no matter the language, the musical still conveys its poignant themes: the tension between tribal loyalty and the need to break free, the convulsive impact on families of romantic love, the pain of separation whether compelled by personal choices or a cruel government. Indeed, Mr. Grey and Christopher Massimine, the Folksbiene’s executive producer, said the play, which ends with the expulsion of Jews from their Russian village and the emigration of Tevye’s family to America, resonates with contemporary events at the Mexican border and in Washington. “One Russian woman told me afterward, ‘This happened to my family and it’s happening again,’ ” Mr. Massimine said. The Yiddish version, “Fidler afn Dakh,” is peppered with phrases that would have been spoken by Sholem Aleichem, whose Tevye short stories were the play’s source, but did not make it into the English production. The creators wanted to universalize the story for audiences of all faiths and backgrounds. They succeeded wildly, with the show performed in languages as diverse as Japanese and Hungarian and in every corner of the United States. In doing so, they trimmed or toned down the Jewish content.","Joel Grey, center, directing Steven Skybell, left, who plays Tevye, and Bruce Sabath, right, who plays the butcher, in the National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene version of “Fiddler on the Roof.”",2018-07-11T22:59:19Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How Do You Say ‘Tradition’ in Yiddish?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/theater/fiddler-on-the-roof-yiddish-folksbiene.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/12yiddishfiddler1/12yiddishfiddler1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tension,1
"Ryan Browne, CNN","(CNN) The United States sailed a warship close to disputed islands in the South China Sea on Sunday, a move that is bound to draw the ire of Beijing and comes amid heightened US-China tensions over a broad range of issues. Two US officials told CNN that the guided-missile destroyer USS Decatur sailed within 12 nautical miles of Gaven and Johnson reefs in the Spratly Islands as part of what the US Navy calls ""freedom of navigation operations,"" which are meant to enforce the right of free passage in international waters. ""US Forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis, including the South China Sea. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,"" a US defense official told CNN. The freedom of navigation operations ""challenge excessive maritime claims and demonstrate our commitment to uphold the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations under international law,"" the official added. While the Navy conducts such freedom of navigation operations all over the world, China is particularly sensitive about the operations when they come near areas where the Chinese government has built islands and established military facilities on disputed maritime features. The last such freedom of navigation operation took place in May when the US Navy sailed two warships within 12 miles of four of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. The US has long slammed what it calls China's militarization of these islands, with US officials accusing Beijing of deploying missiles and electronic jamming equipment there. Earlier this week, the US flew B-52 bombers over the South China Sea and East China Sea, areas considered sensitive by the Chinese military. The flights drew a protest from Beijing, which labeled them provocative. On Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis tried to downplay tensions between the US and China, saying missions like the B-52 flights and Sunday's operation were ""nothing out of the ordinary."" ""There's nothing out of the ordinary about it, nor about our ship sailing through there,"" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon. ""I've noticed that other nations have also incurred certain diplomatic wrath out of Beijing for sailing their ships through. It's international waters, folks."" But Sunday's sailing of a warship by the Spratly Islands is bound to draw a protest from the Chinese government and comes amid heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump accused China of attempting to interfere in the 2018 US elections, and the countries are embroiled in a high-profile trade dispute. In the last 10 days, the Chinese government denied a US Navy warship permission to visit Hong Kong, the US sanctioned a Chinese defense entity over its purchase of Russian-made weapons, the State Department approved a military equipment sale to Taiwan, and a high-ranking Chinese naval officer canceled a meeting with his American counterpart. ""We're sorting out, obviously, a period with some tension there, trade tension and all, so we'll get to the bottom of it,"" Mattis said Wednesday when asked about the tensions. ""But I don't think that we're seeing a fundamental shift in anything. We're just going through one of those periodic points where we've got to learn to manage our differences.""","The United States sailed a warship close to disputed islands in the South China Sea on Sunday, a move that is bound to draw the ire of Beijing and comes amid heightened US-China tensions over a broad range of issues.",2018-09-30T07:11:19Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",US Navy sails past contested islands in South China Sea,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/30/politics/us-sails-south-china-sea/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180930030525-uss-decatur-2-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,tension,1
TIM HERRERA,"9 Places to Get a Gorgeous Tattoo Body art is expensive. Here are great places in America that are worth it. How to Prepare for a Stock Market Surprise The markets have been fairly calm lately. But when financial stress returns, will you be prepared? We offer a classic solution, as well as market insight and analysis, in our quarterly report on investing. This week I’ve invited Rachel Sugar, a writer in Brooklyn, to give us what I think is one of the most brilliant pieces of relationship advice I’ve ever heard. I dislike being rushed. I leave for the airport early, and I like to be at the movies with time to spare. It’s not because I am a punctual person by nature — I am not — but rather because I am both slow and easily stressed. Part of adulthood is knowing oneself, and what I have learned so far is that, under pressure, I am happiest moving at the pace of an arthritic retriever. My boyfriend is the opposite. He loves rushing. The more rushed, the better, he says. He walks at a respectable marathon pace. He loves the thrill of impossibly tight train connections, because it makes him “feel like Jason Bourne.” For years, this was a source of tension. Then we discovered the answer: leave at different times. “I’m going to get a head start!” I’ll say, and leave for the restaurant, while my boyfriend is still showering. And then I go, at my pace — a pace ideal for noticing new storefronts, or attractive dogs — and he shows up at his pace, and no one is angry or stressed or secretly resentful.",It’s as simple as reframing how you think about your money.,2018-07-23T06:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Hate Making Financial Decisions?

ALAN FEUER,"Everything about the Guzmán case has been supersized. Though the defendants nickname means Shorty in Spanish, he is a towering figure described in court papers as the greatest criminal of the 21st century. Hundreds of thousands of photographs and documents are likely to be introduced at his trial. At least 16 cooperating witnesses mostly former underlings and rivals are expected to appear on the witness stand and testify against him. [ Who will testify against El Chapo at trial? ] Facing this onslaught, Mr. Guzmáns lawyers have spent the last few weeks complaining to Judge Cogan that there is no way for them to digest the pile of evidence arrayed against their client and successfully defend him. Earlier this month, they filed a motion accusing the government of inundating them with 117,000 audio recordings and 14,000 new pages of documents. To show how buried in paperwork they were, the lawyers brought the documents to court Tuesday morning and lined them up in 23 white plastic binders, stacked, one next to the other, on a table. But Judge Cogan refused their request to delay the trial again. (It has already been adjourned two times.) He also bemoaned that the defense and prosecution seemed to be in state of high anxiety, peppering him with last-minute requests and pestering him with panicked phone calls, sometimes on weekends. He asked both sides to settle down and implored them to lessen the tension.

HOLLAND COTTER,"Location, location, location. In real estate, place determines value. Sometimes it can for art too. El Museo del Barrio originated in 1969 in classrooms, storefronts and a repurposed fire station in what was then the predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood of East Harlem. The museum was a product of pride and necessity. In local public schools, young artist-activists, often working free, taught children the virtues of cultural self-expression and communal self-sufficiency. And they taught from experience. At the time, no mainstream art institution in the city would show their art. They needed a museum of their own and, collectively, they created one. In 1977, El Museo del Barrio moved to its present address in a city-owned building on Fifth Avenue at 104th Street. The relocation gave the institution more space and greater visibility. But it also took it physically out of the heart of the Barrio, and set the stage for a potential change of character. A territorial tug of war began between supporters who wanted the institution to remain community-identified, and others who were pushing it to become a broadband showcase for Latino and Latin-American art. The tension has stayed high since, and in the past few years, turned ugly. After the museums first non-Puerto Rican director, Julián Zugazagoitia, left in 2010, his successor, Margarita Aguilar, was fired just 18 months after her appointment. Ms. Aguilars successor, Jorge Daniel Veneciano, abruptly quit as executive director after two years. Now a new director, Patrick Charpenel, formerly of the contemporary Museo Jumex in Mexico City, is in place.","Hiram Maristany’s “Hydrant: In the Air,” 1963, gelatin silver print, in the exhibition “Down These Mean Streets: Community and Place in Urban Photography” at El Museo del Barrio.",2018-09-27T21:13:43Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Critic’s Notebook: Finding Common Ground at El Museo del Barrio,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/arts/design/el-museo-del-barrio-liliana-porter-review.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/28/arts/28elmuseo3/28elmuseo3-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tension,1
Leigh Anderson,"New year, new set of bizarro tweets from the president: this time, he and Kim Jong-un are boasting about the relative size of their nuclear buttons in a pissing match so over the top it feels almost scripted. And yet, according to Ian Bremmer, Twitter brinkmanship doesn’t even crack the top ten of things we should be worried about, globally speaking. Bremmer, who is the president of Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk-analysis firm, joined Brian Lehrer yesterday on WNYC for their 10th annual “Global Political Risk” segment. Each year, Eurasia Group publishes a report on the world’s most worrisome places, trends, institutions and issues, intended as guidance for investors but also useful for the lay person who wants to know what exactly she should be terrified about in the next twelve months. Most of the Steelers sat out the national anthem on Sunday, after President Trump expressed an… Read more Read On the call-on show, Bremmer laid out his assessment of the top ten global risks facing the world in the coming year, and some of them might surprise you: China is higher up than North Korea or Syria; the United Kingdom—usually a place Americans think of as a bastion of stability—clocks in at number eight. What’s the number-one concern? China. According to Bremmer, “Trump has renounced the U.S. commitment to Washington-led multilateralism and generated much uncertainty about the future U.S. role in Asia, creating a power vacuum that China can now begin to fill.” Until recently, China has been reticent in any discussion of leadership, but not anymore: combine the ascension of Trump—who is described as one of the weakest presidents in U.S. history—with the rise of a strong Chinese president, and China is now a pacesetter in trade and investment, technology, and values. This means that international businesses will have to adjust; that there will be increased tension between China and U.S. allies in the region, and that global business leaders may begin see China as a viable alternative to “Western liberal democracies.” Random, awful things are up there too. “Accidents” clock in at number two. As Bremmer says on the show, the markets are up, the economy is doing well, but most of us can’t shake our sense of uneasiness when we take a look at the news. Rogue actors and states, like terrorist organizations, pose a significant threat; cyberattacks loom; and Russia, Syria, and North Korea remain loose cannons. Number two is basically “everything we can’t anticipate that could go wrong with hostile powers and unstable states.” You don’t need to wait four years before you get your next say in how the government is run.… Read more Read Latin America breaks the top ten. Mexico’s at number four. NAFTA renegotiations are still up in the air, and depending on how that plays out, the end result could “[create] uncertainty over billions of dollars of economic activity in the world’s most prosperous region.” Presidential elections are in July, anti-Americanism is likely to be a big talking point, and Mexico has no primaries—which means that a guy can get 23% of the vote and still win the presidency. Bremmer kicks off his assessment thus: “Mexico will have a tough year.” Interested in more things to worry about? It’s worth listening to the full segment on WNYC and reading Eurasia Group’s full report. But there is one bright spot: We don’t have to worry so much about Twitter.","New year, new set of bizarro tweets from the president: this time, he and Kim Jong-un are boasting about the relative size of their nuclear buttons in a pissing match so over the top it feels almost scripted.

Adriana Velez,"Nothing beats lying on the sofa and gazing about with pride at the new home you just moved into. That is, unless the reason you’re lying on the sofa is because you strained your back moving furniture. If you’re not used to picking up heavy things (and even if you are), it’s pretty easy to wreck yourself trying to get your bed or sofa in place. You bend, lift, twist, lurch, and crack! A bolt of lightning hits your spine and lays you low for the rest of the day. Or maybe the next six months. It doesn’t have to be this way. You can move your furniture and live to walk upright the next day with just a few simple techniques. So we tapped physical therapists and certified strength and conditioning specialists Michael Lau, Craig Lindell, and Arash Maghsoodi, A.K.A. The Prehab Guys, for their tips. (Prehab is the work you do to prevent an injury, by the way.) And we talked with another certified strength and conditioning specialist Anders Varner, who is also the co-creator of The Low Back Fix program. Here’s what they advise. Get closer “Bring the object as close as you can to your body,” The Prehab Guys told me. “Without getting into biomechanics, the closer an object’s center of mass is to you, the shorter the lever arm is. A short lever arm means less torque is required for you to lift the object.” Don’t bend over at the waist Instead, lower down by bending at the knees and hips, The Prehab Guys say, and keep your back as straight as possible while lowering down and lifting. Get directly in front of the object Don’t just face it, more or less. Actually square your shoulders and your feet to to the object. “Lifting an object that is directly in front of you rather than off to the side prevents unwanted spinal compensation and puts your body in the best position to utilize the glutes and quads to generate power,” The Prehab Guys told us. Your glutes, by the way, are the muscles in your butt. And your quadriceps are at the front of your thighs. The one time my mom watched a video of me deadlifting, she cringed with fear that I was going to… Read more Read Don’t look up “Want to save your back and knees when moving your couch?” says Varner. “Stop looking up.” Looking up puts your neck in cervical extension—i.e. It keeps your neck stretched out at an awkward angle. “Your spine is strongest when it is in a neutral position,” Varner adds. “This means your chin is tucked, eyes forward, ribs down, maintaining a slight squeeze in your glutes.” This position is what Varner considers the baseline for injury reduction. Lift with your legs “We humans are strong,” The Prehab Guys say, “so use all the glorious muscles you have in your legs and don’t rely solely on your back.” If you’re not used to lifting with your legs, remembering to keep your back straight while you lift may help. Breathe with your movement Beyond the classic advice of “lift from the legs,” the secret sauce to lifting safely, Varner says, is the way you breathe. “Taking a deep inhale through the nose into your belly creates tension in your deep core muscles,” he says. “These core muscles strengthen and protect the low spine. A strong core means you can move heavier objects farther, safer, and more efficiently.” When in doubt, stick your butt out Okay, one more, just because I love this phrase by biomechanist and author Kate Bowman. As she demonstrates in the above video, sticking out your butt makes it much easier for you to use your legs instead of your back when lifting.","Nothing beats lying on the sofa and gazing about with pride at the new home you just moved into.

Ivan Mehta,"While Huawei is selling tons of phones worldwide, its facing a grim time in the US with plenty oflawsuits and governmental bans against it over surveillance concerns. Most notably, the companys Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou, has been arrested and is facing a potential sentence of up to 30 years in a US prison. Lets back up a bit, and take a look at how Huawei got into this massive mess.
But first, a bit of context: Huaweis a big deal, not just in China, but across the globe. The company supplies telecom equipment to 170 countries, and crossed $100 billion revenue in the last financial year. It also manufactures laptops, smart fitness devices, microchips, and delivers network services.
On December 1, 2018, Canadian authorities arrested 47-year-old Meng who happens to be the daughter of the companys founder Ren Zhengfei in Vancouver, on the request of the American government. She was charged with violation of the US sanctions to Iran, allegedly helping Huawei cover up wire frauds run by China. A few days later, Chinese authorities said that Mengs arrest was possibly a violation of human rights, and demanded that Canada release her immediately.

Meng Wanzhou, CFO, Huawei
On December 12, less than two weeks after the CFOs arrest, Canadian authorities granted her conditional bail for $7.5 million. Now, she can roam only in a 100-mile radius of Vancouver with an 11 pm curfew, a GPS bracelet tied to her ankle, and a private security firm tracking her movements round the clock.
Late in January, the US justice department filed criminal charges against Meng, and requested filed a formal extradition request with Canada.
Huaweis founder Ren Zhengfei
Last night, Ren told BBC in an interview that Mengs arrest was politically motivated. He also reiterated that Huawei will never undertake any spying activities. Additionally, Ren claimed that the US cant crush us, and the world needs Huawei, as its more advanced.
Mengs comments sound like a retort to US President Trumps decision to ban the use of Huawei and ZTE equipment for government purposes, back in August 2018. And previously, US officials accused Huawei of spying on behalf of China using its equipment last February.
These indictments can significantly impact the Chinese tech giants progress in North America; carriers and big-box retailers like Best Buy have refused to work with Huawei due to the governments pressure. In addition, Trumps aforementioned order meant that the company cant work with government contractors and supply its products to US government agencies.
In 2017, business from the US accounted for 7% of Huaweis revenue. After these bans and virtually no presence in the American smartphone market, that figure will likely shrink a great deal. Regardless of whether its a major loss for Huaweis bottom line, the companys reputation around the world will likely take a hit if its booted from the US entirely.
The companys also one of the biggest network equipment manufacturer in the world, and holds a key place in the worlds march towards a 5G future. Experts have warned that if the US chooses not to use Huaweis devices, its 5G rollout might slow down over the next couple of years. Japan, New Zealand, and Australia have also banned Huawei, while Canada, the UK, and Germany are considering blocking deals with the firm.
All eyes will be on Huawei in the coming year to see if it can convince these countries to use its products and services again.","While Huawei is selling tons of phones worldwide, it’s facing a grim time in the US with plenty of lawsuits and governmental bans against it over surveillance concerns.

Devin Coldewey,"Dozens of high-tech phone smugglers have been apprehended by Chinese police, who twigged to the scheme to send refurbished iPhones into the country from Hong Kong via drone — but not the way you might think. China’s Legal Daily reported the news (and Reuters noted shortly after) following a police press conference; it’s apparently the first cross-border drone-based smuggling case, so likely of considerable interest. Although the methods used by the smugglers aren’t described, a picture emerges from the details. Critically, in addition to the drones themselves, which look like DJI models with dark coverings, police collected some long wires — more than 600 feet long. Small packages of 10 or so phones were sent one at a time, and it only took “seconds” to get them over the border. That pretty much rules out flying the drone up and over the border repeatedly — leaving aside that landing a drone in pitch darkness on the other side of a border fence (or across a body of water) would be difficult to do once or twice, let alone dozens of times, the method is also inefficient and and risky. But really, the phones only need to clear the border obstacle. So here’s what you do: Send the drone over once with all cable attached. Confederates on the other side attach the cable to a fixed point, say 10 or 15 feet off the ground. Drone flies back unraveling the cable, and lands some distance onto the Hong Kong side. Smugglers attach a package of 10 phones to the cable with a carabiner, and the drone flies straight up. When the cable reaches a certain tension, the package slides down the cable, clearing the fence. The drone descends, and you repeat. I’ve created a highly professional diagram to illustrate this technique (feel free to reuse): It’s not 100 percent to scale. The far side might have to be high enough that the cable doesn’t rest on the fence, if there is one, or not to drag in the water if that’s the case. Not sure about that part. Anyway, it’s quite smart. You get horizontal transport basically for free, and the drone only has to do what it does best: go straight up. Two wires were found, and the police said up to 15,000 phones might be sent across in a night. Assuming 10 phones per trip, and say 20 seconds per flight, that works out to 1,800 phones per hour per drone, which sounds about right. Probably this kind of thing is underway at more than a few places around the world.","Dozens of high-tech phone smugglers have been apprehended by Chinese police, who caught onto their scheme to send refurbished iPhones into the country from Hong Kong via drone — but not the way you might think.",2018-03-30T23:05:02Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Chinese police foil drone-flying phone smugglers at Hong Kong border,http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/30/chinese-police-foil-drone-flying-phone-smugglers-at-hong-kong-border/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/drone-rain.jpg?w=711,techcrunch,TechCrunch,tension,1

Even if these rumors aren’t exactly accurate, I would still expect Microsoft to revise the Xbox One Elite Controller at some point soon. Since 2015, the company has done a couple of updates to its standard Xbox One controllers to add better-feeling analog sticks and Bluetooth support. At the very least, I would expect the company to add in those features as it begins using the new gamepads as the basis for upcoming Elite Controllers.

"sdavis@businessinsider.com (Scott Davis), Scott Davis","Sean M. Haffey/Getty Though LaVar Ball once said he'd be hands-off with Lonzo Ball and the Los Angeles Lakers, his comments reached new heights recently when he said head coach Luke Walton has lost the team. Lonzo and Walton both downplayed the comments, but it's another incident that has turned into a distraction for the Lakers. It's unclear how the Lakers can ask LaVar to tone down his criticism and it seems unlikely to stop. LaVar Ball once promised the Los Angeles Lakers that he would be hands-off with Lonzo Ball, and through less than half of the season, that promise has been broken. ESPN's Ramona Shelburne reported in July that LaVar and the Lakers president Magic Johnson sat down before the 2017 NBA Draft in June and LaVar promised that he would let the Lakers work with his son Lonzo. LaVar said he'd coach his two youngest sons, LiAngelo and LaMelo, and would let the Lakers coaches do their jobs. LaVar has not remained hands-off, however. On Sunday, ESPN's Jeff Goodman reported that LaVar believes Lakers coach Luke Walton has lost control of the team. ""Luke doesn't have control of the team no more,"" LaVar told Goodman. ""They don't want to play for him."" The comments were not the first time LaVar became involved with the Lakers' goings-on. He has criticized Walton's coaching before and made Lonzo a target of other players. LaVar's outspokenness even prompted the Lakers to enforce a media rule in an effort to prevent media members from interviewing LaVar at games. Now it seems as though the situation is coming to a head. Both Lonzo and Walton downplayed LaVar's comments on Sunday. ""He is going to say what he wants to say,"" Lonzo told reporters. ""I can't [do] nothing about it."" Lonzo, however, didn't exactly give a ringing endorsement of Walton, saying he will play for whomever is coaching the team. Said Walton: ""We're, I feel, very secure in my job status right now. We talk all the time. [Management is] 100 percent behind and supporting what we're doing."" Walton even had some fun with the comments, joking after the Lakers' 132-113 win over the Atlanta Hawks of substituting Lonzo out of the game, ""His dad was talking s--- so I took him out early."" Yet this round of comments is making waves. Dallas Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle blasted ESPN for giving LaVar an outlet, saying as an NBA partner that ESPN should not be broadcasting a ""blowhard"" calling for a coach's job. Likewise, according to NBA reporter Sam Amico, some coaches want to deny media credentials to reporters who interview LaVar. While many in the NBA world may dispute the methods by which LaVar became a prominent voice, he's nonetheless now someone who makes headlines, not just a typical sports parent. When he calls for Luke Walton's firing, it means Lonzo, Walton, and the Lakers have to answer questions about it. It's unclear how the Lakers could proceed from here. Lonzo has made it clear that LaVar will say what he wants, a suggestion he does not intend to tell his father to quiet his criticisms. And the Lakers could kindly ask LaVar not to say such things, but they don't have any sort of power to make him stop. Despite some in the NBA world insisting it wouldn't matter, this was always the fear about drafting Lonzo — it's a package deal. The Lakers now have LaVar Ball to deal with, and it seems unlikely that he'll tone it down any time soon.","Sean M.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Masked police officers said they would not confront protesters Hundreds of members of the Honduran riot police force known as Cobras refused to carry out orders to enforce a night-time curfew on Monday. The curfew was imposed in the wake of a bitterly disputed presidential poll. The electoral authorities say incumbent Juan Orlando Hernández has an unassailable lead but have not yet officially declared him the winner. Rival candidate Salvador Nasralla has cried foul and his supporters have been on the streets protesting. At least three people were killed as protests turned violent last week. 'Act with your conscience' About 200 Cobras gathered at the police headquarters and announced they were no longer willing to confront protesters, arguing that it amounted to ""taking sides"" in the political battle between Mr Nasralla and President Hernández. ""We are rebelling. We call on all the police nationally to act with their conscience,"" one masked officer told Reuters news agency. ""Our people are sovereign. We cannot confront and repress their rights,"" another officer said reading a statement drafted by those rebelling. Some of the striking police joined supporters of Mr Nasralla who were demonstrating in the streets in defiance of the curfew. They were cheered by the protesters, some of whom held up signs reading ""I love the police!"". Image copyright Reuters Image caption Protesters thanked the Cobras for ""joining the just fight of the people"" Reports said police in other cities also joined their Cobra colleagues in the strike. Earlier, election monitors from the regional body, the Organization of American States, said that ""irregularities, errors and systematic problems"" with the presidential election on 26 November meant they could not be certain of the result. The head of the observer mission, Jorge Quiroga, also urged the Honduran authorities to carry out a wider recount of ballots. Electoral authorities carried out a recount of about 6% of the votes on Monday and have not ruled out a wider recount. President Hernández called for ""brotherhood, for sanity, for national unity"". Unlike in previous public appearances, the president did not claim victory on Monday. The electoral tribunal website suggested that with 99.98% of the votes counted, President Hernández had a lead of 1.6 percentage points over Mr Nasralla.

SHEAR, ADAM LIPTAK and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG","Casey, which gave states the authority to regulate abortion so long as those regulations do not pose an “undue burden” on the woman, is “precedent on precedent,” he said. On that issue and others, Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly sought to demonstrate empathy, telling senators that when it comes to understanding the real-life implications of abortion, “I don’t live in a bubble. I understand. I live in the real world.” He defended his dissent last year in Garza v. Hargan, in which he argued that the Trump administration should have been allowed to temporarily block an undocumented teenager from having an abortion while it sought to place her with a sponsor. He said he had followed Supreme Court precedents, even as he acknowledged that there was no directly applicable case. “I did my level best in an emergency posture,” Judge Kavanaugh said. He said that took the teenager’s situation into account. “I tried to recognize the real-world effects on her,” he said. “I said consider the circumstances. She’s a 17-year-old, by herself, in a foreign country. In a facility where she’s detained. And she has no one to talk to. And she’s pregnant. Now that is a difficult situation.” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said Judge Kavanaugh had participated in an attempt to deny the teenager access to a constitutional right, placing her health at risk. Protesters continued to interrupt the hearing, adding to the tension after an opening day on Tuesday in which dozens of people were arrested for loudly disrupting the proceedings. There were more arrests on Wednesday.

BRANTLEY Yes, but we seem to be too restrictive in our definition, a point Elisabeth raised earlier. “Contact,” for example, Susan Stroman’s hit collage of nearly 20 years ago, uses prerecorded music to tell a story (again through dance), and in using existing tracks, it is perhaps the most literal of jukebox presentations. VINCENTELLI Exactly. It depends on what we think carries the narrative. For me, it’s a combination of everything, the musical as an illustration of Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk, which I’m sure you never imagined you’d hear in conjunction with “Movin’ Out.” GREEN But again, what’s the “werk” about?

Julie Muncy,"Every duel begins with jitters. A nervous stepping back and forth, a careful circling of my opponent. I, as Wolf, the protagonist of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, raise my sword, and my opponent raises their own weapon, whether it be a sword, a stave, or something stranger. Eventually, one of us strikes, and we clasha wild burst of shining metal, flying sparks, blocks and parries and attacksuntil one of us backs away, or one of us makes an error. Usually, the error is mine, but I'm not easy to beat. I'm usually the weaker fighter, but I'm also usually the most determined. That kind of thing goes farther than you think.
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a game about the drama of confrontation. Much of its runtime is spent in a series of unforgiving and tightly designed boss fights, forcing you into face-off after face-off against a small army of champions, monsters, and tragic heroes who want you dead. Beating them requires tenacity and a willingness to be direct. Fights in Sekiro, the big, hard fights, aren't won by hiding, or dodging, or trickery. They're won through relentless, decisive action. In Sekiro's feudal Japan, you fight because fighting is the onlythe onlyway forward.
For developers From Software, who have spent much of their recent history designing games that reward avoiding enemies, that encourage never, ever getting hit by an opponent's attack, this is a distinctive adjustment. Sekiro is decidedly not a Dark Souls gamethat needs to be said at the outsetbut it does feel in dialogue with From's earlier action games, and seems to build off of the knowledge about players learned from those games to craft a more tonally controlled challenge.
To put it simply, Dark Souls and Bloodborne showed that, given the opportunity, most players will play things as safe as possible, waiting for openings to attack their opponents. The higher the challenge presented, the more careful players will be. Sekiro, then, is an answer to a design problem: How do you get players to play aggressively, to take risks, even when the challenge is as intense as possible? The answer, of course, is to give them no other choice.
Sekiro is a game designed around the feeling you have right before the big confrontationthe moment when only the hero and villain remain, sizing each other up, perparing. You play as Wolf, a shinobi endowed with supernatural powers from his master, a young boy whose blood can resurrect the dead. With that power, you can never permanently die, and each death comes with a chance to immediately rise up at least once more to try again. With that power comes a dogged determination: to save your master from the enemies who have taken him. You are alone, with nothing but your strength and an unyielding oath, and you will not stop until your master is safe.
Sekiro is an answer to a design problem: How do you get players to play aggressively, to take risks, even when the challenge is as intense as possible? The answer, of course, is to give them no other choice.
Your battlefields are idyllic, quiet pieces of feudal Japan. A regal lord's manor, rising up from the mountains. Deep valleys haunted by spirits. Bamboo forests and snowy fields. Lands that are placid and scenic, yet full of tension and dread, until you arrive and start spilling blood, turning that dread from subtext to the truth.
Bosses, in this game, are mostly just littered around the environment in plain sight. Generals among their soldiers, monsters among lesser beasts. A lord atop his tower. As a shinobi, Wolf has tricks to deal with the small fry. You can sneak in this game, picking off opponents from on high, and a grappling hook embedded into your prosthetic arm lets you flank or outright avoid many lesser enemies.
While the emphasis on trickery does extend to some boss fightsa few enemies here and there are pretty vulnerable to some of your equipment, and sneak attacks work on somethe primary use of these abilities is to clear the field for the big encounters. There's deep satisfaction in sneaking around a battlefield, eliminating all of the lesser enemies in the tall grass, before standing and showing yourself to a boss who now has to face you with all of his soldiers dead.
Then comes the clash. To encourage direct actioneither with a forward assault or well-timed guards that deflect an enemy's attacksFrom Software has introduced an extra meter alongside an opponent's health. Called posture, it fills up every time an opponent is injured or their attack is deflected. If it fills up all the way, they stagger, and you can hit them with a single, punishing strike, a deathblow. Each boss requires at least one deathblow, if not several, to kill. You also have posture, which renders you vulnerable to equally devastating attacks if filled up.
It's possible to fight these enemies in a standard, more careful style, dodging and getting your licks in when you can. But the game is exceptionally punishing to play this way. Instead, From Software wants you to learn when and how to effectively deflect attacks, which lends the fights the drama that they want. A good fight in Sekiro is fast and dizzying, suffuse with action-movie cool, just as compelling as any good samurai flick. The system serves to accomplish precisely what those movies do, the tension turning the fight from something dramatic into something mythic.
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is certainly not for everyone. For a certain type of player, it will undoubtedly feel like the most difficult game From Software has ever produced. But it's also enthrallingly atmospheric, its combat and setting contributing to a palpable, engaging sense of mood. It's a game of powerful imagery, of swords crossed in the morning mist. The challenge of Sekiro exists to create that mood, and to answer a design problem in From's earlier games. That's not the point, exactly. But to enjoy Sekiro, you have to accept it anyway.

"Associated Press, Associated Press","A woman with a national flag waits on the side of a highway in Caracas to see a caravan of buses organized by opposition leader and self-declared acting president Juan Guaido, pass by as it heads to the border with Colombia to bring in US-supplied humanitarian aid. 
 (Photo11: YURI CORTEZ, AFP/Getty Images)
CUCUTA, Colombia Venezuelas National Guard fired tear gas on residents clearing a barricaded border bridge to Colombia on Saturday, as the opposition began making good on its high-risk plan to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuela despite objections from President Nicolas Maduro.
By midday, opposition leader Juan Guaido pulled himself onto a semitruck and shook hands with its driver as he and Colombian President Ivan Duque gave a ceremonial send-off to an aid convoy looking to transport nearly 200 metric tons of mostly U.S.-supplied emergency food and medical supplies from the Colombian border city of Cucuta.
Our call to the armed forces couldnt be clearer: put yourself on the right side of history, he said in an appeal to troops who constitute Maduros last-remaining major plank of support in a country ravaged by hyperinflation and widespread shortages.
The opposition is calling on masses of Venezuelans to form a humanitarian avalanche to escort the trucks across several border bridges.
But clashes started at dawn in the Venezuelan border town of Urena, when residents began removing yellow metal barricades and barbed wire blocking the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge. Venezuelas National Guard responded forcefully, firing tear gas and buckshot on the protesters, some of them masked youth throwing rocks, who demanded that the aid pass through.
Later, the youth commandeered a city bus and set it afire. At least two dozen people were injured in the disturbances, according to local health officials in Urena.
The potentially volatile moment for both Venezuelas government and opposition comes exactly one month after Guaido, a 35-year-old lawmaker, declared himself interim president based on a controversial reading of the constitution before a sea of cheering supporters. While he has earned popular backing and recognition from over 50 nations, he has not sealed the support of the military, whose loyalty to Maduro is crucial.
Were tired. Theres no work, nothing, Andreina Montanez, 31, said as she sat on a curb recovering from the sting of tear gas used to disperse the crowd.
A single mom, she said she lost her job as a seamstress in December and had to console her 10-year-old daughters fears that she would be left orphaned when she decided to join Saturdays protest.
I told her I had to go out on the streets because theres no bread, she said. But still, these soldiers are scary. Its like theyre hunting us.
At the Simon Bolivar bridge, a group of aid volunteers in blue vests calmly walked up to a police line and shook officers hands, appealing for them to join their fight. But the goodwill lasted only a short while and a few hours later they were driven back with tear gas, triggering a chaotic stampede.
At the same post, four National Guardsmen deserted the force early in the day and took refuge inside Colombia.
A video provided by Colombian authorities shows three of the men wading through a crowd with their assault rifles and pistols held above their heads in a sign of surrender. The young soldiers were then ordered to lie facedown on the ground as migration officials urged angry onlookers to keep a safe distance.
Ive spent days thinking about this, said one of the soldiers, whose identity was not immediately known. He called on his comrades to join him: There is a lot of discontent inside the forces, but also lots of fear.

Guaido, who has offered amnesty to soldiers who join the oppositions fight, applauded their bravery, saying it was a sign that support for Maduro was crumbling.
They arent deserters, he said on Twitter. Theyve decided to put themselves on the side of the people and the constitution..The arrival of liberty and democracy to Venezuela cant be detained.
International leaders including U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres are appealing for the sides to avoid violence.
But on Friday, a member of an indigenous tribe was killed and 22 others injured in clashes with security forces who enforced Maduros orders to keep the aid out at a crossing with Brazil.
In previous waves of unrest, citizens have been tear-gassed and killed.
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said the military would never have orders to fire on the civilian population and likened the aid push to a media spectacle.
We can only hope that sanity and good sense prevail in Cucuta, in Colombia, and that it will remain as a big show, a big party, and that they dont try to open the doors to a military intervention, he said Friday at U.N. headquarters in New York.
The push comes on the heels of a giant concert organized by British billionaire Richard Branson aimed at pressuring Maduro to accept the aid. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans gathered in a field to hear pop stars like Juanes sing beneath a scorching sun. Guaido made a surprise appearance toward the end.
The opposition is planning to hold three simultaneous aid pushes on Saturday. Aside from the events in Colombia, they also hope to get humanitarian assistance delivered by sea and through Venezuelas remote border with Brazil, which the government of Maduro has ordered closed.
Amid the sometimes chaotic and hard-to-verify flow of information, opposition lawmakers and Guaido said the first shipment of humanitarian aid had crossed into Venezuela from Brazil although reports from the ground revealed that two trucks carrying the aid had only inched up to the border itself.
Dueling demonstrations also took place in the capital. Government opponents, one of them dressed like Captain America in a nod to the Trump administrations prominent role cornering Maduro, headed toward an air base. With the opposition mostly mobilized along the border, a much larger mass of red-shirted government supporters, some of them on motorcycles, filed downtown toward the presidential palace.
Venezuelas military has served as the traditional arbiter of political disputes in the South American country, and in recent weeks, top leaders have pledged their unwavering loyalty to Maduro. However, many believe that lower-ranking troops who suffer from the same hardships as many other Venezuelans may be more inclined to now let the aid enter.
Opposition leaders are pushing forward in belief that whether Maduro lets the aid in or not, he will come out weakened. They also contend that if the military does allow the food and medical gear to pass, it will signify troops are now loyal to Guaido.
Analysts warn that there may be no clear victor and humanitarian groups have criticized the opposition as using the aid as a political weapon.
I dont know that anyone can give a timeline of when the dam might break, and its quite possible that it wont, said Eric Farnsworth of the Council of the Americas and Americas Society, a Washington-based think tank.
Fearful of what they might encounter, some Venezuelans in Cucuta said they planned to stay away from the border crossings, while others said theyd face the risks and go.
For my son, Id risk everything, said Oscar Herrera, 25, a Venezuelan man who took an 18-hour bus ride to Colombia to buy his infant medicine for a skin irritation earlier this week.
Hernan Parcia, 32, a father of three, said he planned to go with his entire family.
Im pained by whats happening to my country, he said. They can count on me.

"sdavis@businessinsider.com (Scott Davis), Scott Davis","Alex Goodlett/AP The Cleveland Cavaliers may be beyond repair as the trade deadline approaches. The Cavs have been plagued by infighting, and an explosive new report revealed growing friction between LeBron James and the front office, namely team owner Dan Gilbert. There is growing skepticism that the Cavs can make a trade that would turn their season around, and may choose not to make a big move as chatter grows about James leaving in free agency. With the NBA trade deadline on Thursday, the Cleveland Cavaliers are under pressure to make a big move, but there may not be anything that can save their season. The Cavaliers are 6-9 in 2018, with the third-worst defense in the NBA over that time frame. Their net rating — the amount a team outscores or gets outscored by an opponent per 100 possessions — is -7.2, better than only the 18-36 Phoenix Suns. According to several reports, the Cavaliers may be beyond repair this season. According to an explosive report from The Athletic's Jason Lloyd, there is tension between LeBron James and the front office, namely with team owner Dan Gilbert, as the team has been ""pivoting"" away from James' input on franchise decisions. James and Gilbert have a turbulent history. When James left the Cavaliers in 2010 to join the Miami Heat, Gilbert infamously wrote a public letter criticizing James' character that left James incensed. The two reportedly reconciled when James returned to the Cavs in 2014, but reports have indicated that they may have never totally gotten over the incident. According to Lloyd, things started to turn in the offseason when Gilbert did not renew then-GM David Griffin's contract. James supported Griffin, who often kept James in the loop on front office goings-on, according to Lloyd, and even publicly vouched for him. Then, when Kyrie Irving requested a trade from the Cavaliers, James told the front office not to deal him, believing he could repair the relationship. However, the team decided to deal Irving, and the trade that sent him to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic, and the Brooklyn Nets' 2018 pick was never run by James. According to Lloyd, James now has no relationship with the front office. Cavs GM Koby Altman, who was promoted following Griffin's exit (though only after the Cavs reportedly low-balled Chauncey Billups, their top choice for GM) is reportedly seen as a ""front man"" for Gilbert, who is calling the shots. Lloyd reported that during a fiery team meeting in January that left the locker room ""divided"", James directed his ire at the front office, though it's unclear what he said. There has been pressure on the Cavs to use that Nets pick (likely a top-10 pick) as part of a package to improve the team. But it appears the team's free-fall and rising tensions may disincline the team from making a big move, as James may be set on leaving in free agency, anyway. That, in turn, doesn't reflect well on the front office in James' eyes, according to USA Today's Sam Amick. Amick reported the Cavs are ""refusing to even discuss"" trading the pick (their best trade asset), which sends the message to James that the team is preparing for life without him. Amick argued that any team would be wise to do everything they could to build around the NBA's best player, but instead, the draft pick appears to be their insurance policy if James leaves again. However, it's unclear what type of players the Cavs could target with that pick that could turn the team around. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski said on ""The Lowe Post"" podcast that the Cavs can't make trade that could plug all of their holes. ""The relationships are frayed at every level — player-on-player, coach-on-player, owner-on-player, front office-on-star player,"" Wojnarowski said. ""There's no savior for them. There's no trade that's going to fix this, certainly not anyone who's available or what they could get with what they have."" James has a no-trade clause and reportedly won't waive it, meaning the Cavs can't get ahead of a potential departure this offseason. There is a growing belief in the NBA world that the Cavs problems this season are unlike their usual January struggles — mid-season slumps that get turned around. The team's defense is a disaster, and from the sounds of it, things behind the scenes are just as ugly.","Alex Goodlett/AP The Cleveland Cavaliers may be beyond repair as the trade deadline approaches.

Scott Davis,"The Cleveland Browns fired head coach Hue Jackson on Monday, as ESPN's Adam Schefter first reported. In two-and-a-half seasons with the Browns, Jackson posted a 3-36-1 record, going winless last season. His win percentage with the Browns was just.088. The move came after the Browns lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 33-18, on Sunday to fall to 2-5-1. Additionally, reports surfaced in recent weeks about tension on the Browns coaching staff, particularly between Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley. Jackson recently openly questioned his team's offense and said he would become more involved, though he wouldn't take on play-calling responsibilities. Jackson survived as head coach, despite going 0-16 last season, even as the Browns reshaped the team following the hiring of GM John Dorsey. Some felt Jackson was in a make-or-break season with the Browns and needed to have a successful start to the season after the team made some big moves in free agency to bolster the roster. Instead, with Baker Mayfield starting since Week 3, the team has looked sluggish and inefficient, even with considerable talent on both sides of the ball. According to Yahoo's Charles Robinson, Dorsey did not want Mayfield to be caught between the disagreements between Jackson and Haley and decided to make a change.

Mark Kaufman,"This post is part of Science of Sci-Fi, Mashable 's ongoing series dissecting the science (or lack of science) in our favorite sci-fi movies, TV shows, and books. Thanks to fictional depictions, we tend to think of spaceships as well-fortified machines. But in reality, even in the emptiness of outer space, their hulls would be under threat of bombardment from near-invisible enemies. In the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises, ships are usually fitted with deflector shields — zones of energy that absorbed beams of enemy fire. The USS Enterprise, for example, could repel an enemy's colorful phaser blasts by putting its shields up. To increase dramatic tension, those shields generally didn't hold up for long. SEE ALSO: The science behind Star Trek technobabble Back in our century, the science of deflector shields doesn't hold up for long either. (The Star Trek version relied on ""gravitons,"" a hypothetical particle we haven't discovered yet.) Good thing we haven't yet discovered any Romulans, Klingons, or other intelligent adversaries we need to rebuff. But during missions through our solar system, spacecraft already need to be protected against a less visible enemy: speeding micrometeorites. ""Those things are coming at you pretty fast,"" says Mia Siochi, a NASA research materials engineer. Smaller than a grain of sand, micrometeorites are hard bits that have broken off asteroids and are zooming through space at some 15,000 mph — or nearly 10 times the speed of a bullet. A hole left by a micrometeorite on NASA's Solar Maximum Mission satellite. Image: nasa That explains why our satellites and other space vessels have already received the metallic equivalent of gunshot wounds — and why NASA's Siochi and other engineers have developed a futuristic material that can, when punctured, heal itself. ""They’ll heal back up, self-repair, and continue to function,"" she said. The tiniest alien threat To life on Earth, micrometeorites aren't thought of as dangerous — because here they're not. These minuscule objects tend to vaporize in our upper atmosphere. Yet ""in space, no blanket of atmosphere protects a spacecraft or a spacewalker,"" warns NASA. On the International Space Station, for instance, the habitats are layered with thick Kevlar and aluminum "" Whipple Shields,"" and for good reason. Astronauts, peering out of the space station windows, have witnessed close-calls to the exposed space station — including a ""bullet hole"" left in a solar array. ""Glad it missed the hull,"" Commander Chris Hadfield tweeted in 2013. Micrometeorites need not tear through a spacecraft wall to cause a small ruckus. They sometimes leave millimeter-sized craters in aluminum siding. One even pinged off a space station window, damaging the thick glass. But out beyond Earth's orbit, spacecraft can't be easily repaired — or escaped in an emergency — like the space station can. Punctures need to be repaired, ideally in a matter of microseconds. Therefore this must be done without the help of any astronaut or spacecraft mechanic. To fix this problem, NASA and university engineers are working on what they call ""Rapid Puncture-Initiated Healing"" material. To self-heal, it performs a kind of space judo — using the energy of the micrometeorite against itself. Think of the material as a three-layered wall, with two solid outside layers, and a liquid inner layer. When a projectile moving at some 15,000 miles per hour pierces the entire wall, it generates friction and heat as it passes through. This short-lived heat stimulates the liquid to rapidly flow and fill the hole in a few microseconds. It then solidifies, preserving the wall, and perhaps, the spacecraft. Siochi and her team tested the material with the fastest projectiles on Earth: bullets. ""We were actually using a gun,"" Siochi said, during a test that took place in a specialized government facility. After the bullets stopped flying, engineers examined the material, and found evidence that it had successfully healed. This material isn't just able to self-repair. It may also make spacecraft lighter, said Siochi. Future spaceships are depicted as giant cosmic SUVs, layered with vast chunks of metal, laser cannons and so forth. Such science fiction concepts might exist in the deep future, once we're a fully spacebound species. But in the short term, our ships are still dependent on powerful rockets to leave the Earth. This puts a limit on how large and heavy any spacecraft can be — and gives lighter vessels a significant advantage. They won't need to use as much fuel. When NASA's material researchers are called upon to put self-healing walls to use, they'll be ready, said Siochi. Someday, perhaps, a spacecraft zooming through an alien solar system will be able to heal its walls from a zone of debris and meteor-ridden space, en route to visit a curious, uncharted planet. That spacecraft's captain won't even have to insist on putting the shields up.","This post is part of Science of Sci-Fi, Mashable 's ongoing series dissecting the science (or lack of science) in our favorite sci-fi movies, TV shows, and books.

Akbar Shahid Ahmed,"WASHINGTON ― A little over a month ago, Iran established something close to a diplomatic presence in Saudi Arabia for the first time in nearly two years. The Saudis, for their part, got an equivalent not-quite-embassy in Iran. Suddenly, two regional powerhouses whose rivalry had caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and untold global instability seemed a little closer to peace ― courtesy of Switzerland, which announced on Oct. 25 that it would represent Saudi interests in Iran and vice versa. The Swiss mandate is narrow. It only covers consular services, as a Swiss official was quick to remind HuffPost. The official said the foreign ministry had no further comment on the policy. But when it comes to the possibility of a rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, even the smallest steps matter. Despite the furor over U.S. President Donald Trump ’s upending of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process this week, the defining fault line in the Middle East today is not between supporters of Palestine and those of Israel. The fight that will decide the Mideast’s future is that between Iran and its many opponents — most importantly Saudi Arabia. “They are locked in a zero-sum power contestation,” said Randa Slim, a prominent peace-building expert at the Middle East Institute, a think tank. “Iran says it will never leave the Middle East” ― that is, accept a marginal role in regional affairs ― “including the Arab region, since it is from this region. Saudi Arabia says Iran has no role to play in the Arab region since it is not an Arab country. The level of tensions that exists today between the two countries is one of the highest I have witnessed.” Peace in the region depends on effective diplomacy between Riyadh and Tehran. Years of attempts to achieve that goal have yielded a little progress and a lot of frustration — but experts say that given regional turmoil and the two countries’ inevitably intertwined futures, even limited proof of success shows it’s worth trying. The good news is that the Swiss channel is just one of multiple attempts. Since autumn 2015, Western officials have paid increasing attention to a Europe-based effort to bring together a group of influential Saudis and Iranians on a fairly regular basis twice a year. “Regardless of political tensions, there is always a core in both countries — in academia, but also in the think tank scene and in the security establishment — that is interested in having some forms of communication,” said Adnan Tabatabai, the head of the Center for Applied Research in Partnership with the Orient in Bonn, Germany. Known as a Track II dialogue because it does not include government (Track I) figures from either side, the exercise is a partnership, backed by the German government, between CARPO and the EastWest Institute, a nonpartisan American think tank. The process is extraordinarily sensitive. The dialogue’s organizers do not reveal the names of the Saudis, Iranians and others who attend (usually European experts on the region). Nor do they say where the meetings are held. It’s understood that the participants might share information or analysis with policymakers, Tabatabai said, but there have not been official inquiries from any side. The priority is maintaining trust, confidentiality and good faith ― which involves expectations like the Chatham House rule that insights from the conversations can be shared externally, but only if they are free of identifying information about which individual or institution they came from. “A real success is already if you have a continuous channel where people of knowledge from both sides come together to discuss current developments and do so in a civilized manner where discussions are frank yet respectful, and where you actually throughout those meetings have coffee breaks, lunches, dinners where these people then simply mingle and socialize and humanize each other,” Tabatabai said. “What we regard as a success is that throughout the past two and a half years we have been able to bring participants from both countries together six times and have had a continuous conversation which builds on the previous rounds.” After four of the meetings, the organizers have released brief reports to share the perspectives and concerns the Saudis and Iranians brought. They also conduct briefings in capitals around the world. Officials see the dialogue as useful because it sustains relationships between fairly consistent groups and deliberately covers a range of issues. Among them so far are the refugee crisis, environmental concerns, the threat posed by Islamic State militants, and plans to reduce the two countries’ reliance on oil revenue. Simply meeting face-to-face regularly and becoming familiar with each other’s methods can make it easier for both sides to be honest, according to Richard Nephew, a former top State Department official who participated in the broadest U.S. talks with Iran in decades as part of the Obama administration’s nuclear diplomacy. He recalled something similar occurring during those negotiations. “In those initial conversations, the dimensions of what you could say and what you could float were profoundly different than a year and a half in,” Nephew told HuffPost. And committing to a dialogue even as Saudi Arabia and Iran have cut off official diplomatic ties and ratcheted up their rhetoric sends an important signal ― that both sides take the talks seriously, and that some true confidence has developed. “It’s really impressive how [Tabatabai and his team have] managed to maintain these exchanges even after all of the terrible events of the last three years,” a Western government official told HuffPost. Tabatabai’s definition of failure is a situation where no one is even able to start a conversation. That prospect seems more likely in a year in which Saudi Arabia’s crown prince called Iran’s leader “ the new Hitler ” and Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen almost successfully destroyed the main Saudi airport. The report on the last workshop, held this past April, noted that it was more difficult than before to secure balanced participation on both sides. The increasingly hard-line Saudi position ― which the kingdom says is an appropriate response to Iranian assertiveness following its gains from the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 ― is a particular problem. “Saudi officials have decided to go all in contesting Iranian influence in their backyard. They will not abandon this strategy anytime soon,” Slim, who runs her own broad regional dialogue at the quasi-official Track 1.5 level, said. She noted that even during less assertive periods, Saudi Arabia has been wary of engagement through nonofficial channels. “The Iranians, always they have shown readiness,” said Seyed Houssain Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat who worked on engaging the Saudis. “ During the late King Abdullah’s era, Riyadh was ready to hear what the Iranians say, but no more in [current King] Salman’s era. ” Mousavian, now a researcher at Princeton University, sees the growing reluctance on Saudi Arabia’s part as a result of anxiety about the nuclear deal and Iran’s outreach to the West. For years, Saudi Arabia has sought to have its U.S. partner serve as a balancing force in the region, while Iran, skeptical of Washington’s intentions and more confident in its own abilities, has pushed to shape the Middle East on a bilateral basis, according to a 2009 study from the RAND think tank. The Trump administration’s chumminess with the Saudis, and its determination to challenge Iran, means there’s presently little American pressure to reconcile the two powers ― though there’s still an acknowledgement that in the long run, a reconciliation is essential. Asked about the new Swiss policy, a State Department official said: “We have seen these reports. We continue to urge leaders across the region to take affirmative steps to calm tensions.” Some observers feel the U.S. could do more even if the administration doesn’t want to. A top congressional aide working on Capitol Hill efforts to promote Saudi-Iran dialogue told HuffPost there’s frustration in progressive circles that former Obama aides are not more vocal, particularly to say their experience suggests Iran is willing to engage with its adversaries. But there’s no telling when positions might soften on their own. Some analysts believe that when the Saudi king-to-be thinks he has fully consolidated his control and boosted Saudi prestige abroad, he may modify his tone and attempt compromise. Experts say Riyadh and Tehran have pragmatically kept their governments ready to launch such engagement at fairly short notice. “There’s a number of well-placed Saudis who know their counterparts in Iran very well, not through [Tabatabai’s] stuff and not through the Swiss,” the Western official said. Slim noted that the two governments have communicated surreptitiously for years through U.S., Swiss, Iraqi, Emirati and Kuwaiti officials ― most recently in a Kuwaiti mediation that “reached an advanced stage” but is now “on hold if not finished.” And despite impressions that sectarian differences might preclude open engagement, as most Saudis follow the Sunni school of Islam and most Iranians adhere to Shiite ideology, analysts say religious differences are not decisive. Probably more important are the differences in political systems, with Iran supporting and exporting the idea of a quasi-democratic theocracy, which the Saudis see as a threat to absolute monarchies like their own. Mousavian and Nephew, Iranian and American diplomats respectively, both told HuffPost the key to successful talks is high-level interest. In the 1990s, reformist Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and then-Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah wanted to defuse tensions lingering from Saudi police scuffles with Iranians during the Hajj ceremony in Saudi Arabia in 1987, the Lebanese Civil War and other issues. Rafsanjani sent Mousavian to the kingdom as a special envoy in the summer of 1996. “We discussed security concerns, interferences, very, very honestly, openly, frankly. We talked about the minorities ― the Shiite minority in Saudi, the Sunni minority in Iran ― and mutual suspicions about interferences in our internal affairs,” Mousavain said. “Ultimately, our package was a very comprehensive package that led to good Saudi-Iran relations for almost a decade. ” “The two leaders were really positive, both of them,” he noted. “We were recognizing every concern. We were not fighting. We were saying, ‘If this is your problem, what is the solution?’” “The first real hurdle we had to overcome [in the Iran nuclear talks] is knowing that they were speaking on behalf of their government,” Nephew said. Otherwise dialogue can be useless, even with good intentions. “Saying the words ‘regional dialogue’ is a little bit like saying grace when you sit down at a table,” he added. For Tabatabai, whose dialogue has identified a host of problems the Saudis and Iranians will have to cooperate on at some point, it’s about waiting for that perfect moment. He believes political reconciliation at the highest level will happen sooner or later ― and when it does, he said, his project wants to ensure it can be deeply rooted in both societies “to continue these expert discussions on the social level.”",Tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran now defines the world's most combustible region the way the Israeli-Palestinian conflict once did.,2017-12-08T11:18:21Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}","Tension Between Saudi Arabia, Iran Now Defines World’s Most Combustible Region",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/middle-east-peace-process-iran-saudi-arabia_us_5a296f1de4b03ece0300c51f,http://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.huffingtonpost.com%2Fasset%2F1200_630%2F5a298116150000d59f85c13c.jpeg%3Fcache%3DrPSOXfw2jy&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=ca150c31274d22f00f1d5ba9b1771149c921a47c,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,tension,1
JAMES PONIEWOZIK,"The Season 3 premiere of Better Things is about nothing, and its about everything.
Sam Fox (Pamela Adlon), a mid-list actress who lives in Los Angeles, tries to squeeze into some old clothes shes outgrown. She takes her oldest daughter, Max (Mikey Madison), off to start college in Chicago. She has a scary flight back. She arrives home at night, discovers that her mother, Phyllis (Celia Imrie), has had a fender-bender, and ends up, exhausted, helping her stressed-out daughter Frankie (Hannah Alligood), with her homework.
There is nothing like a traditional plot arc in the episode, nor is there in most episodes of Better Things. And yet, as the confident new season unfolds starting Thursday on FX, you see the number of themes the premiere has casually established: aging, growing up, freedom, dependence, mortality, responsibility, the flowering and wilting of life, all at the same time.
Thats all just human existence, the labor of love. And there is nothing on TV today that represents it better or more gorgeously.
Sams college trip with Max, for instance, nails the tension of parenting between the desire to hover over your kids and to push them away. Sam takes Max to a bar and urges her to seize her new life, but when Max leaves her to go out with some friends, Sam calls her back: Wait!

Adam Rosenberg,"For anyone who's been paying attention to the social media discourse around video games in recent days, you've probably noticed a couple of frequently repeated buzzwords.
There's ""difficulty"" and ""accessibility,"" and lots of discussion around the tension between those two concepts. There's also ""Sekiro"" and ""FromSoft,"" a reference to the newly released game Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice from Dark Souls and Bloodborne developer From Software.
SEE ALSO: More video games should let you fight and kill horses, like 'Sekiro'
I'll be the first one to admit that the discourse around video games online can sometimes come across as unapproachable to a wider audience. But I also think this particular example is well worth taking the time to understand, so let's dive in.
What is this game?
Image: From Software
Sekiro is a game where you play as a ninja in a fantasy world version of feudal Japan. You've got a big sword, a mechanical arm, and a bag of tricks to pull from as you hack-and-slash your way through an army of foes.
From Software games are known for their high levels of technical challenge, and Sekiro is no exception. Instead of using sword chops to whittle away at each enemy's health, you're slowly degrading their posture their ability to fend off your attacks, basically while maintaining your own. Break their posture and you earn yourself an opening to deliver a quick showstopper of a killing blow.
In practice, Sekiro battles are a deadly dance. You're reading every frame and watching for the slightest giveaway moment as you circle a foe. There are different audio cues and visual cues that you pick up with time and experience, and therein lies the game: keep throwing yourself at a threat until you learn its behaviors, then use that knowledge to overcome it.
The high degree of challenge lies in the details. Enemies move swiftly and without any reliable pattern. They appear in different groupings, or are tucked just out of sight until you cross some invisible line. Bosses and minibosses, Sekiro's greatest tests, demonstrate a wider variety of moves and strike harder in general.
I've been playing games both personally and professionally for a very long time. Sekiro is by far the most challenging one I've ever played. I doubt I'll ever find the time to master it, or even finish. Lots of people have reached a similar conclusion, and that's perfectly OK. 
So what's all the fuss about?
Image: From software
Sometime after Sekiro released on March 22, people started suggesting that maybe From Software could lighten up a bit. Where games like Dark Souls and Bloodborne gave players the option of slowly increasing their power until steep threats became more manageable, Sekiro doesn't do the RPG-style leveling thing in quite the same way.
What's more, Sekiro isn't online at all. In past From games, an online connection opened up access to a number of benefits, including helpful, player-scrawled notes and, more importantly, the ability to summon outside help. A total stranger could hop into you game at most times and, yes, choose to screw up your day. But they could also help, and be helped in return. Even the hardest bosses become trivial when it's 2v1.
Sekiro ditches all of that. There's no online play. There's no power-based leveling. This is a game without any kind of safety valve. You either come to grips with mastering it... or you don't. And if you don't, well... there's a whole lot of beautiful, thought-provoking game you're missing out on. 
From games don't do ""easy"" difficulty settings or any kind of adjustable difficulty by design, but Sekiro ditches all pretense: there's no help to be found. Though as many have pointed out, ""easy"" is a relative concept.
""I myself deal with occasional chronic pain thats only alleviated by a brace. When I put it on, I am ten percent clumsier with a controller, making Sekiro ten percent harder. Can I rise to meet that extra ten percent? Maybe. Should I be expected to? Thats a different question,"" Joshua Rivera wrote for Kotaku in a post arguing that an ""easy mode"" has never ruined a game.
Rivera continued: ""Some people with disabilities may not need adjustments, but thats exactly the point: 'Hard' means different things to different people.""
Difficulty vs. accessibility
Image: from software
This is where we come to the heart of the conversation around Sekiro. There's a faction of From Software diehards who resist any suggestion that the game could be made more welcoming for a wider audience. They claim such a move would torpedo From's artistic intent, as evidenced by the studio's past games and general philosophy around what constitutes challenging gameplay.
But that's not quite right. Whether those fans truly believe in the importance of preserving From's ""artistic intent"" or they're just (subconsciously or not) gatekeeping their ""for elite players only!"" game, they're forgetting that difficulty is subjective. Interpretations of what ""hard"" means vary wildly, especially when you accept that not every player possesses the same physical or cognitive skills.
Besides, all of those ""but artistic intent!"" arguments overlook another core fact about video games: there's something exciting, even rewarding, about breaking the rules as they are written. As Waypoint's Patrick Klepek argued, longtime gamers aren't exactly strangers to this idea.
People have always sought different ways to play a game, and we hypocritically conflate the terms ""easy,"" ""effective,"" and ""fun"" with whatever makes us situationally look better. Players used to hold their PSPs in weird ways, a method called the ""claw,"" in order to control Monster Hunter's camera correctly. Capcom probably didn't plan for that! Cheat Engine, essentially a modern day Game Genie, is a piece of software entirely devoted to letting you, well, cheat. Every person has a story where they glitched through a wall, or watched a boss glitch to their death, and celebrated that advancement as canon.
He points to an even wider range of examples than that, from classic cheats like the Konami Code which made Contra (among others) much more approachable for all players back in the day to modern examples of ""cheesing,"" or using blind spots in a game's code or AI programming to claim some kind of advantage.
So, difficulty is subjective. It's ultimately a function of design and is based on how a game's creator perceives the audience. Accessibility is a different consideration entirely. It is, as ""accessibility, inclusion and diversity advocate"" Cherry Thompson wrote for IGN, about recognizing barriers.
Games are, at their core, a set of barriers arranged to create a challenge, mixed with the illusion that youre solving it all yourself. There are times, however, where developers might have created barriers we dont realize are there. Its why we playtest, and its how we end up accidentally excluding players, especially disabled players, who wed like to include. We deliberately mitigate and remove barriers all the time in the course of game design (Sekiro does this through its frequent checkpoint idols and the stealth indicators, for example) but if we dont design and test with the full spectrum of our player base in mind, well inevitably have unintentional barriers.
Accessibility is about removing or mitigating those unintentional barriers. The obstacles that spring up and prevent a chunk of the audience from enjoying the game on the same level as the target crowd.
Thompson's feature discusses the various improvements From Software has made on the accessibility front over the years. Discrete volume sliders, larger on screen text, and the ability to remap control schemes have all made the studio's various games more approachable without sacrificing the emphasis on technical skill which is to say, mastering the controls and mechanics that is central to every encounter in a From game.
But, she adds, that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. That's really the crux of all the discussion around accessibility in the wake of Sekiro's release: for all the angry ""git gud"" players, as Klepek calls them the people expressing concern that a more accessible Sekiro represents a betrayal of From's central focus they're missing the point.
Steve Spohn, COO of the AbleGamers charity, summed it up quite well in a Friday thread on Twitter.
In any game, whether it's Sekiro, Dark Souls, or any other skill-based game, there should be options to allow your health to be modified, your enemies help to be modified, and the game speed adjusted.
This does not make the game easy. It allows people to make the game equal
 Steve Spohn (@stevenspohn) April 5, 2019
Nobody is advocating that we take your favorite game that is famous for being frustratingly difficult and make it so easy nobody cares.
The only request on the table is to allow people who cannot ""git gud"" by learning, to have the options to make the game playable
 Steve Spohn (@stevenspohn) April 5, 2019
It's not like this is a new conversation. There are fresh examples every day of games making strides and getting accessibility right. As Thompson pointed out, even creative teams like From that embrace a certain dogmatic attitude toward difficulty have shown the capacity to grow and improve. 
But there's always room for improvement, even as there are plenty ofcreators out there that get it. I'm here laying all of this out because I think the community should be an equal participant in reminding creators that difficulty is relative and wholly removed from making games accessible for every kind of player.","For anyone who's been paying attention to the social media discourse around video games in recent days, you've probably noticed a couple of frequently repeated buzzwords.

JEFFERY C. MAYS,"The midterms showed there is more of an appetite than ever for a much more diverse cohort of leaders, Mr. Smikle said. Now, there is an expectation to produce more diverse candidates, and if voters dont see that, they will automatically say this is a problem.
The position of public advocate exists because it was intended to address the problem of a lack of minority leadership in city government, said Eric Lane, who served as executive director and counsel to the 1989 Charter Revision Commission. (Later that year, David N. Dinkins was elected as the citys first and only African-American mayor.)
The commission agreed to expand the City Council to 51 seats, up from 35, to increase the chances of minorities being elected, but citywide representation remained a problem.
There was considerable racial tension in the city, Mr. Lane said, and a sense that despite the minority population growing, there was not adequate minority representation in government.
There were also calls to abolish the position of City Council president. Mr. Lane and others argued that eliminating the position would prove harmful to minorities and not be approved by the United States Justice Department, which had to approve revisions to the City Charter under the Federal Voting Rights Act.
The commission initially kept the title of City Council president, but redefined the position into more of an ombudsman role.

Sam Haysom,"Warning: Contains spoilers for Black Mirror Season 4. In a lot of ways, Black Mirror Season 4 is familiar territory. You've got your gnawing tension, your twist endings. That same old sense of humanity's inevitable, yawning doom, lurking just one or two iPhone updates away. All that good stuff. SEE ALSO: Karl Pilkington totally predicted 2 'Black Mirror' Season 4 storylines There is one thing Season 4 has a lot more of than past seasons, though, and that's Easter eggs. From self-referential cutaways to subtle, easy-to-miss moments, here are some things you may not have spotted on a first viewing. 1. The ""vehicle boot console"" text hiding in ""Metalhead"". Computer text is always a good place to start your Easter egg hunt, and ""Metalhead"" doesn't disappoint. If you pause the screen and zoom in when that guy's desperately attempting to start that van near the beginning of the episode, the first thing you'll see is this: Pay close attention to the stuff written below 'Fireware matches'. Image: netflix And, once he finally gets the thing working, this: Those drivers certainly sound familiar... Image: netflix It's tricky to read, but that text includes previous Black Mirror episode titles, a line reading ""reddit\easter.egg"" (in the first pic) and — best of all — some text at the bottom of that last screen that literally says: ""WHY. did. you. bother. PAUSING. this. you. freak"". 2. And the significance of the box of bears at the end. This one isn't an Easter egg, but it's the still the sort of detail that could be easily missed amongst all the other traumatic stuff happening at the end of ""Metalhead"". Basically, the reason for that final, lingering shot on the box of bears links back to this exchange right at the beginning of the episode: Clarke: ""This is mental, this is. I mean he's — he's dying anyway. Well, he is. It's not like it's going to save him. He's got — what, days?"" Bella: ""Well if what's in there makes those days easier that'll do for me. I promised my sister we'd help him."" Then, right at the end of the episode, Bella says the following into the radio: ""I'm sorry I didn't get the replacement like I promised. I know how dear it was to him."" So essentially the bears were the main aim of their mission, and what they ended up losing their lives for. They were trying to get a replacement teddy for Bella's sister's son, to make his dying days a little easier. The final miserable cherry on top of a truly dystopian cake. 3. The clip from ""Men Against Fire"" used in ""Arkangel"". That clip above is from the Season 3 episode ""Men Against Fire"". If you watch ""Arkangel"" carefully, though, you'll notice that the exact same footage appears on the iPad Sara is given to watch at the Arkangel offices: 4. The significance of Saint Juniper. As one Redditor dives into in great deal in the thread above, Saint Juniper seems to hold a fair bit of significance in the Black Mirror universe. Obviously we had the San Junipero episode in Season 3, but now we also have the ""Saint Juniper's"" hospital referred to by Rolo Haynes in ""Black Museum"". A clue to the reasoning behind this name choice could lie in the history of St. Francis of Assisi, one of whose followers was apparently called Brother Juniper. The story goes that the Friar once went the extra mile to fulfil a dying man's request to eat pig's feet. Aside from the references to pigs and robots discussed in the thread above, this theme (helping to fulfil a sick person's final wish) ties in pretty closely with the ""Black Museum"" and ""San Junipero"" storylines. 5. Aaron Paul's cameo in ""U.S.S. Callister"". Aaron Paul's brief voice appearance as ""Gamer691"" is the first of two fairly subtle celebrity cameos in the ""U.S.S. Callister"" episode. This one's definitely the easiest to spot, though — even though you don't see him, if you're a fan of Breaking Bad you'll almost certainly have recognised Jesse Pinkman's voice. 6. And Kirsten Dunst's brief appearance. This one is way more subtle. If you skip to about 10 minutes in to ""U.S.S. Callister"", you'll spot Kirsten Dunst — currently engaged to Jesse Plemons, who plays Robert Daly in the episode — casually strolling through the shot with her arms folded. 7. The ""San Junipero"" postcard hiding in Metalhead. It's lying on the desk in the house Bella breaks into. Image: netflix/mashable composite One of the big Black Mirror theories that appears to be confirmed in Season 4 is that all the episodes are taking place in the same universe. The brief appearance in ""Metalhead"" of a postcard for ""San Junipero"" — the resort that has a whole episode dedicated to it in Season 3 — is just one of the many subtle nods to this. 8. The smashed iPad from ""Arkangel"" that appears in ""Black Museum"". ""Black Museum"" takes the ""one universe"" theory to a whole new level. Pretty much all the artefacts in Rolo Haynes' nightmarish museum are props that feature in other Black Mirror episodes. The iPad above, for instance, is the console the mother in ""Arkangel"" uses to spy on her daughter. 9. And the bathtub from ""Crocodile"". That blood-stained tub is the same one in which Shazia's husband gets bludgeoned to death by Mia in ""Crocodile"". 10. Also the lollipop featured in ""U.S.S. Callister"". Yep, that's the same lollipop Robert Daly uses to steal Walton's son's DNA in ""U.S.S. Callister"". 11. Plus there's a robot bee from ""Hated in the Nation"". It's not just Season 4 that gets referenced in the museum, either. Does that tiny little creature in the GIF above look familiar? It's one of the mechanical bees used to murder people in the Season 3 episode ""Hated in the Nation"". 12. And the man from ""White Bear"". The cheerful chap above is one of the masked hunters chasing the protagonist of the Season 2 episode ""White Bear"". 13. The matching pizza companies. Is that you again, Fence's Pizza? Image: netflix/mashable composite Another favourite trick of Charlie Brooker's in Season 4 is using the same fictional companies or brands in multiple episodes. ""Fence's pizza's a big company,"" says Shazia in ""Crocodile"". ""They've been in the press claiming they're driverless for years."" They're also the same company that deliver to Robert Daly in ""U.S.S. Callister"" (pictured above). And they're not the only brand name with multiple mentions, either. The game featured in ""Playtest"" also pops up in ""Black Museum"", the TCKR company Haynes works for is the same one behind San Junipero, and even the porn company that originally appeared in ""15 Million Merits"" — ""WraithBabes"" — shows up again in ""Crocodile"". You can find a detailed list of similar connections on Reddit. In Brooker's nightmarish future, nothing, it seems, is accidental.","Warning: Contains spoilers for Black Mirror Season 4.

THESSALY LA FORCE,"At Chanels most recent spring ready-to-wear collection, held in Pariss Grand Palais on an overcast morning last October, nearly 3,000 guests were transported to Sylt, a tiny German island in the North Sea, where Karl Lagerfeld, the houses longtime artistic director, first remembers encountering the ocean as a child. The nave of the late 19th-century, 828,220-square-foot exhibition hall was, save for its vaulted glass ceiling, encased with a cotton backdrop depicting a blue sky flecked with fluffy clouds. Then, one by one, 80 barefoot models some with sandals dangling from their hands began to walk down a runway of sand while real-water waves crashed gently on the artificial shore.

Martha Tesema,"The latest chapter in the long-standing feud between Drake and Pusha-T arrived on Tuesday evening, and boy, it's a doozy. Their issues with one another began back in 2011, after years of tension between Pusha and Lil Wayne, Drake's mentor. ( Complex has a solid explainer of the full history behind the trio's feud.) The beef picked back up last week with the release of Pusha's new album, featuring a song titled ""Infrared"" that includes a slight against Drake. In response, Drake dropped a diss track titled ""Duppy Freestyle."" Those tracks cover relatively tame subjects, focusing more on Drake's alleged ghostwriter and Pusha's past drug dealings, respectively. This recent blow, courtesy of Pusha, is a lot harsher. His brand new diss track, ""The Story of Adidon"" — dropped Tuesday night — has raised the stakes significantly higher. SEE ALSO: The reviews are in for Drake's newest single, 'I'm Upset,' and they're not that great The track is a ruthless attack on the 6 God that claims to reveal a lot about Drake, including a reference to the rapper's alleged secret child. It's also incredibly messy, so let's sift through it together. Let's talk about the song itself First things first: If the production sounded familiar to you at all, that's because Pusha-T is rapping on the same instrumental as Jay-Z's "" The Story of OJ,"" off of Jay's critically acclaimed 2017 album 4:44. On ""Adidon,"" Pusha goes for it, no holds barred, naming Drake's parents, their failed marriage, and the impact that might have had on the rapper. As Pusha told Power 105.1 FM's Breakfast Club on Wednesday morning, he felt justified in rapping about Drake's personal life because of a line in "" Duppy Freestyle "" where the rapper mentioned Pusha's fiancé by name. ""That alone causes all bets to be off,"" Pusha explained in the interview. Pusha also addresses Drake reckoning with his own blackness in the song. ""Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough/Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough,"" he raps, referencing Drake discussing his afro on the MTV show When I Was 17. But there's one topic brought up in the song that set Twitter timelines ablaze: Drake's alleged son with a woman named Sophie Brussaux (her now-private Instagram handle was mentioned in the song). ""You are hiding a child, let that boy come home/Deadbeat mothafucka, playin' border patrol/Adonis is your son and he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that's real Love that baby, respect that girl, forget she's a porn star, let her be your world,"" Pusha raps. Brussaux, a painter and former adult actress who performed under the name Rosee Divine, was spotted publicly with Drake once in 2017. Soon after that, TMZ reported that Brussaux received alleged text messages from the rapper telling her he wanted her to have an abortion. According to Vulture, she gave birth to a baby boy on October 24, 2017 — which happens to be Drake's birthday. Yikes. Drake has mentioned babies in songs before, most recently on the song ""Sacrifices"" off of his 2017 playlist More Life. ""I got no baby on the way,"" he rapped. As of Wednesday, he has not publicly commented on rumors that he is the father of Brussaux's child. But wait...what does a baby have to do with Adidas? In the song, Pusha references ""an Adidas press run,"" saying that Drake's alleged son Adonis deserves more than that. In his Breakfast Club interview, he breaks the line down, explaining that it references a rumored deal Drake has allegedly secured with Adidas. ""Allegedly his new line [with] Adidas is called 'Adidon' which is named after Adonis, his son,"" Pusha claims. ""We couldn't know about your child until you started selling sweatsuits and sneakers?"" If the Adidas rumor is true ( GQ speculated on a Drake deal with the company in March), Pusha-T has effectively ruined the rollout and all search engine optimization of the brand by naming this diss track ""The Story of Adidon."" (We've reached out to Adidas for comment.) Like I said, this stuff is messy. The track's cover art is also important here Probably one of the most striking parts of this song isn't in the production or lyrics itself — it's in the photograph that accompanied the piece. It's an image that appears to show Drake in blackface, taken by photographer David Leyes, who has since removed it from his own website after tweeting at Pusha's manager to remove the image from his social media pages. Leyes' tweet has since been deleted. In a tweet featuring the photo posted Tuesday night that links to Leyes' website, Pusha wrote, ""Please stop referring to this picture as 'artwork'... I'm not an internet baby, I don't edit images... this is a REAL picture... these are his truths, see for yourself."" Though the image is still up on Pusha's Twitter account, the image was removed from his Instagram page because, according to a note from Instagram sent to Pusha, ""a third party reported that the content infringes or otherwise violates their rights."" Some fans online and outlets like XXL suggest the image might have been part of a campaign for Toronto clothing company Too Black Guys, which released a ""Jim Crow Couture"" line back in 2008. Posts from back then on Drake's blog, ""October's Very Own,"" also show him modeling other shirts for the company. Regardless of where the damning image is from, Leyes has maintained, via Instagram comments posted on Tuesday night, that they were Drake's idea — he was just executing the vision. Image: Davidleyes/instagram While he distanced himself from the idea behind the shoot, Leyes did stand by the photo. ""For sure I took it!!!,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""I'm proud to be part of a strong statement made by a black man about the fucked up culture he is living in."" Image: davidleyes/instagram (We've reached out to Leyes for comment.) So, what does Drake have to say about all of this? Though Drake has yet to respond himself, Drake's go-to producer and collaborator Noah ""40"" Shebib responded on Tuesday night. 40 was named on the track in a low-blow line that referenced his battle with multiple sclerosis. ""OVO 40, hunched over like he 80, tick, tick, tick/How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick,"" Pusha raps. 40's response? ""Coincidentally... tomorrow is World MS Day,"" he wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, Drake will embark on his "" Aubrey and the Three Amigos Tour "" this summer, and perhaps we'll get glimpses of the beef played out in real-time on the road, similar to what he pulled on Meek Mill back in 2015. Regardless, on ""The Story of Adidon,"" Pusha raps that ""it's about to be a surgical summer,"" so get ready — there's no telling what's coming as the months get hotter.","The latest chapter in the long-standing feud between Drake and Pusha-T arrived on Tuesday evening, and boy, it's a doozy.

Stephen Dinan,"STANDISH, Maine — As the Senate emptied Saturday, the tension of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh ’s confirmation finally lessening, Sen. Susan M. Collins went desk to desk picking up discarded copies of the Congressional Record from the day before. They contained the official text of her 44-minute address to colleagues Friday afternoon — a speech that took the wind out of Democrats’ opposition, sealed Justice Kavanaugh ’s confirmation and, according to her colleagues, will go down in history as a masterful statement of centrist principles in a chamber where the political center has all but disappeared. If liberal activists have their way, Ms. Collins will disappear from the Senate, too. They had been counting on her to buck her party and vote against Justice Kavanaugh, a move that might have doomed his nomination. They had even attempted what some senators called a “bribe,” raising millions of dollars in campaign pledges that they said they would donate to her opponent if she voted for President Trump’s nominee. They had reason to hope she was on their side after Ms. Collins late last month demanded that the FBI look into sexual misconduct accusations lobbed at Justice Kavanaugh, dating back to high school and college parties in the 1980s. Even after the FBI returned with no evidence to back up those accounts, Democrats denounced the investigation and pleaded with Republicans to join them in rejecting Justice Kavanaugh. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who sits in the chamber next to Ms. Collins, joined the Democrats, saying Justice Kavanaugh wasn’t the right person for the high court. Then Ms. Collins took to the Senate floor Friday afternoon, in the most anticipated floor speech in years. “It is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy,” she warned before taking a scalpel to Democrats’ list of grievances against Justice Kavanaugh. Where they saw opposition to Obamacare in his rulings, she saw a careful judge whose reasoning that the Affordable Care Act was a use of Congress’ taxing power closely mirrored the logic that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would later use to declare the 2010 health care law mostly constitutional. Democrats read the tea leaves and saw a justice committed to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a national right to abortion. But Ms. Collins, after hours of interviewing Justice Kavanaugh in what one senator later called a masterly legal clinic, said she doesn’t see it. “In short, his views on precedent would preclude attempts to do by stealth that which one has committed not to do overtly,” she said. And where Democrats saw a conspiracy in the pick, saying Mr. Trump wants Justice Kavanaugh on the court to shield him from legal jeopardy in the special counsel’s Russia investigation, Ms. Collins pointed to three cases in which the judge repeatedly cited in his confirmation hearing as guiding lights. All of them involved the high court’s constraint of the power of an overzealous president. She also pointed to Justice Kavanaugh ’s ruling on the circuit court in favor of rights of detainees in the war on terrorism — a case in which he rejected the argument of President George W. Bush, the very man he had served for years as staff secretary and who had appointed him to the appeals court. Turning to the assault accusations, Ms. Collins said she found accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony “sincere, painful and compelling.” But she said there was no corroborating evidence, and indeed those Ms. Blasey Ford said were witness to the party where she said she was assaulted have all refuted her. “We will be ill-served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be,” Ms. Collins said. When she finished her speech Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, the remaining undecided Democrat, quickly announced he, too, would back Judge Kavanaugh ’s nomination, guaranteeing the judge a smooth vote Saturday. Back home in Maine, the debate over Ms. Collins ‘ future was heating up. Steve Nason, 44, said he had always questioned Ms. Collins ‘ claims to be a moderate but that her speech impressed him with its thoroughness and thoughtfulness. “The threats and opposition she has faced as of late did not deter her from her duties and convictions,” he said. “I applaud her efforts. If she had demonstrated the same commitment to the truth and came up with a different conclusion, I would still support her based on her efforts.” But Penny Lynn, a 39-year-old social worker who was dismayed by Justice Kavanaugh ’s defense of himself against the sexual assault claim, said Ms. Collins will suffer for her defense of the nominee. “While we are in these sort of times where we are having hard conversations and people are really split, you don’t get to be moderate or a centrist anymore when you have moved forward this guy who acted the way he acted, and to me he is almost a caricature of white male privilege,” Ms. Lynn said. In Washington, Democrats’ disappointment was clear. “History will judge this decision,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat, told reporters minutes after the speech. Critics outside the Capitol included horror writer Stephen King and former newsman Dan Rather, who accused Ms. Collins of becoming a tool of Republican Party power. Former Obama National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice, who was forced to pull her nomination for secretary of state over concerns that she lied to the country in 2012 about the Benghazi terrorist attacks, hinted that she might run to unseat Ms. Collins in 2020, tweeting “me” Friday in response to the question “who wants to run for senator in Maine?” In an appearance Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Ms. Collins said she would face that challenge and quickly called into question the Democrat’s ties to the New England state. “As far as Susan Rice is concerned, her family has a home in Maine, but she doesn’t live in the state of Maine. Everybody knows that,” Ms. Collins said. Whether it’s Ms. Rice or someone else, the Democratic challenger will quickly be able to tap the $3.4 million in campaign cash raised by the liberal advocates who tried to sway Ms. Collins ‘ vote — $1 million of which was pledged within hours of her speech. The sudden surge in donations to “Either Sen. Collins VOTES NO on Kavanaugh OR we fund her future opponent” briefly crashed the Crowdpac website hosting the campaign. “During Collins ‘ floor speech, our site received 90 times the average amount of traffic we see hourly,” said Gisel Kordestani, Crowdpac’s chief executive. From the right, though, Ms. Collins ‘ speech was hailed as a landmark statement of decency and fairness. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who had been the star of the Kavanaugh show for Republicans until Ms. Collins ‘ speech, called her address “one of the most consequential speeches in the history of the United States.” “It should be required viewing in every civics class in America,” he said. “The country needed what Susan Collins provided today — reason, facts and an understanding of who we are as a nation. She rejected winning at all costs and the politics of personal destruction.” In an appearance Sunday, Ms. Collins said she wasn’t backing down. “Over the years, the people of Maine have trusted me to exercise my best judgment. That’s what I did in this case,” she said. “Whatever the voters decide, but I’m going to do what I think is right.” • Andrew Blake and Valerie Richardson contributed to this report.

https://www.facebook.com/philip.bump,"The sense given by President Trump is that theres an imminent threat at the southern U.S. border. On Wednesday morning, the tension was obvious in his tweets about a caravan of migrants making its way north from Central America. The Caravans are made up of some very tough fighters and people, he wrote. Fought back hard and viciously against Mexico at Northern Border before breaking through. Mexican soldiers hurt, were unable, or unwilling to stop Caravan. Should stop them before they reach our Border, but wont! At about the same time as he was writing this, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News, indicating that the Mexican government had been helpful in addressing the caravan. As for the fighting, there was a clash between the migrants and police on Sunday that left one migrant dead. Trump then made the case for his decision to send troops to the border. Our military is being mobilized at the Southern Border. Many more troops coming, he wrote. We will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S. Our Border is sacred, must come in legally. TURN AROUND! This is the pitch in a nutshell: The caravan is dangerous and plans to enter the country illegally; therefore the military is needed immediately to turn them away. Every part of that sentence is unfounded or false. First of all, the caravan is not anywhere close to the border. Since organizing in Honduras and departing about two weeks ago, it has moved west into Mexico and north into the state of Oaxaca. We noted last week that the journey by foot from the southern to northern borders of Mexico could take several weeks. That estimate may have been too low, depending on where the caravan is headed. Theres also no indication that the caravan is made up of some very bad thugs and gang members to any significant degree. After Trump first tweeted about the dangerous elements in the caravan last week, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that there are individuals within the caravan who are gang members or have significant criminal histories. How many such individuals are in the caravan is unclear; reporters on the ground report that it is largely families fleeing violence in their home countries. [ Who is really in the migrant caravan? ] For Trump, its important to emphasize criminality in the caravan because that reinforces the idea that the military is needed to repel the group at the border. Why is it important for the military to go to the border? Given that the group is still thousands of miles from the border, the answer appears to be that it offers Trump a potent visual before next weeks midterms. On Wednesday, The Post noted that the military isnt the only government agency thats being conscripted to aid the Republican electoral effort. Trump has repeatedly asserted that the caravan will be a campaign issue, even lamenting last week that the mail bomber was drawing media attention away from it. Fox News and Fox Business Network continue to cover the story far more than CNN and MSNBC. Its important to highlight the other ways in which Trumps military-to-the-border tweet is incorrect. First, when a caravan approached the border last spring, it grew smaller as it progressed northward, both for the obvious reason that walking thousands of miles is not easy and because many migrants remained in Mexico instead of continuing to the United States. A few hundred made it to the border. There, they began the process to seek asylum, approaching a designated port of entry to make their claims. In other words, the migrants didnt simply surge across the Rio Grande, scattering to the wind, the visual that Trump seems to imply is the case. They attempted to enter the country legally. Second, the military cant really do much at the border anyway. The Associated Press reported that troops will not be allowed to detain immigrants, seize drugs from smugglers or have any direct involvement in stopping a migrant caravan thanks to laws prohibiting the military from acting as law enforcement officials on American soil. They presumably wont cross the border into Mexico to block migrants there, either, given how Mexico might feel about several thousand troops entering its territory. [T]heir role will largely mirror that of the existing National Guard troops about 2,000 in all deployed to the border over the past six months, the APs Astrid Galvan reports, including providing helicopter support for border missions, installing concrete barriers and repairing and maintaining vehicles. But, again: There are no participants in the caravan who are anywhere near the border at this point anyway. Even if the military could form a phalanx along the border to forcibly repel people from entering, theyre going to have to wait for quite some time before the migrants actually arrive. Whats going to be interesting to see is whether the troops are still in the region when the caravan, however big it ends up being, arrives at the border. Tuesdays going to get here far before the migrants do, so the main motivation for moving the troops to the border may fade sooner than expected.","Washington Post The multilayered uselessness of sending troops to the border right now Washington Post The sense given by President Trump is that there's an imminent threat at the southern U.S. border.

PTI,"Islamabad: Saudi Arabia on Monday vowed to try to ""de-escalate tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of the deadly terror attack in Pulwama by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman prepares to head to New Delhi from Islamabad. The terror attack happened when a suicide bomber blew up an explosive-laden vehicle near a convoy of CRPF buses in Pulwama district on Thursday, killing 41 CRPF soldiers.
Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir met Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Monday. 
 Officials said that Qureshi briefed him in detail about the situation after the Pulwama attack in Kashmir. 
Tensions have been mounting between the two nuclear-armed neighbours amidst war of words and diplomatic brinkmanship over the attack.""Our objective is to try to de-escalate tensions between the two countries, neighbouring countries, and to see if there is a path forward to resolving those differences peacefully,"" Jubeir told the media.
He also said both countries were facing similar challenges, including the scourge of terrorism.
""We want both countries to resolve their conflicts and have peaceful relations,"" he said.
Saudi Arabia has influence over Pakistan and the Crown Prince during two-day visit inked at least seven MoUs and agreement to make investments of worth USD 20 billion.
The Kingdom also provided USD 3 billion loan and another USD 3 billion oil facility on deferred payment during the past three months.
Jubei's remarks to make efforts for reducing tensions came as Pakistan on Monday called back its envoy from India for consultations.
Pakistan High Commissioner to India Sohail Mahmood was on Friday summoned in New Delhi by Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale who lodged strong protest. 
Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria was also called to New Delhi for consultations in the wake of the attack.
India has blamed Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammad terror group for the Pulwama terror attack on Thursday.

News18 Staff,"Her statement came amidst Indo-Pak tensions. OIC is an influential grouping of 57 Islamic countries.Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi did not attend the foreign ministers' meet of the OIC states over the invitation extended to Swaraj. India is not a member of the OIC, but was invited as a guest of honour. 
India's engagement with the OIC comes in the midst of escalating tension between India and Pakistan. The ties strained further after Indian fighter jets bombed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed's biggest training camp near Balakot deep inside Pakistan early Tuesday. Pakistan carried out a retaliatory aerial raid on Wednesday.
Shah Mahmood Qureshi, meanwhile, has admitted that Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar is in the country, but said he is very unwell and not even in a position to leave his house. On the question of arresting him, Qureshi told CNN that India needs to give Pakistan evidence that is acceptable in the courts of Pakistan. India had on Wednesday handed over a dossier to Pakistan on Jaishs role in the Pulwama terror attack. On designation of Azhar as a global terrorist by the United Nation, Qureshi said Pakistan will welcome any step that leads to de-escalation. If they have good solid evidence please sit and talk, please have dialogue and we will be reasonable, he said.
A delegation of IAF team will on Friday receive Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured by Pakistan during an aerial combat, at the Wagah border, official sources said. Varthaman's MiG 21 was shot and he bailed out after bringing down one Pakistani F-16 fighter during a dogfight to repel a Pakistani attack on Wednesday morning. He has been in Pakistan since then. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced in Parliament on Thursday that Varthaman would be released on Friday in a ""peace gesture"".
Tensions between the two countries escalated after Indian fighters bombed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed's biggest training camp near Balakot deep inside Pakistan early Tuesday. It came 12 days after the JeM claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Kashmir, killing 40 soldiers. It is not clear whether Varthaman will be handed over to the International Red Cross or to the Indian authorities by Pakistan. 
Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has offered to receive Wing Commander Varthaman at the Attari border. The Congress leader tweeted his request to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Dear @narendramodi ji, I'm touring the border areas of Punjab &amp; I'm presently in Amritsar. Came to know that @pid gov has decided to release #AbhinandanVartaman from Wagha.
