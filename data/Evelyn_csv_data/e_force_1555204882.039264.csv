Jonathan Shieber,"President Trump is expected to sign into creation the Space Force today, as a special branch of the military overseen by the Air Force Department, according to a report in The Washington Post.
The President’s decision is considered a win for the Air Force and Defense Department broadly, which had argued against setting up an independent military department based on their concerns that it would add new layers of bureaucracy, according to the Pentagon .
Speaking at an event at The Brookings Institute, Air Force chief of staff Gen. David L. Goldfein discussed the decision-making process around the creation of the Space Force — saying that Defense Department officials had discussed a range of options from creating an entire department to establishing a smaller, professional core of personnel, like the Army’s Medical Corps.
With the decision, the Trump Administration is likely to establish a service that looks more like the Marine Corps, which is part of the Navy but unique within it, than an entirely new branch of the military. The Space Force will be led by a four-star general who will have a set on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but it will not have a secretary-level post, according to the Post report.
Perhaps more significantly, the Trump administration is reviving the U.S. Space Command, which will be headed by a four-star officer and will coordinate military operations in space.
These days, those operations consist of communications, surveillance and satellite defense, but as plans continue to set up more permanent bases on the Moon and eventually Mars, these efforts could expand to protect personnel as well.
The U.S. disestablished the Space Command in 2002 under the George W. Bush administration. Created in 1985 during the Reagan administration’s second term when the “Star Wars” missile defense program was in full swing, the Space Command was tasked with defining strategic objectives for the U.S. in space, and executing them.
When President Trump announced the new Space Command in December, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said that the surge in threats to America’s space program warranted the resurrection of the program.
We are shifting to a war fighting culture at the explicit recognition that it is a war fighting domain, Wilson was quoted by Space News as saying at the time. Adversaries are developing capabilities to deny us the use of space in crisis or war. The creation of a unified command puts focus on the ability to protect our assets on orbit and prevail if called upon.","President Trump is expected to sign into creation the Space Force today, as a special branch of the military overseen by the Air Force Department, according to a report in The Washington Post.

"Jaime Green on Offspring, shared by Michelle Woo to Lifehacker","When the Girl Scouts put out a pre-holiday reminder to parents that their daughters don’t owe anyone a hug, even at the holidays, it was taken as a sign of the (dismal) times. “At a time when issues of sexual harassment and consent are in the news,” began the CNN story on the piece. Reactions on Twitter made the connection, too: But it hasn’t just “come to this.” It’s been this for a long time—the advice and the problem it addresses are nothing new. More importantly, this advice isn’t a reaction to the news. It’s about teaching kids the importance of consent and empowering them to speak up for their own needs and desires, which are evergreen lessons. The Girl Scouts’ developmental psychologist Dr. Andrea Bastiani Archibald said, in the Girl Scouts’ post, “the lessons girls learn when they’re young about setting physical boundaries and expecting them to be respected last a lifetime.” This applies to kids of all genders. It lays the groundwork for a strong understanding of consent, and can influence a kid’s relationship with her body—by telling her that she’s in control of who she hugs, you’re also telling her that her body is hers, not for serving other people’s feelings. That has to do with consent, but also body image, too. Enforcing your child’s bodily autonomy isn’t just an investment in her future strength and safety. Dr. Archibald adds, “sadly, we know that some adults prey on children, and teaching your daughter about consent early on can help her understand her rights, know when lines are being crossed, and when to go to you for help.” (Again, this applies to children of all genders.) Reminding your child that she has the power to say “no” to physical contact, even from a beloved relative, is hugely important. Contrarian reactions to this kind of advice (which I won’t link to because anti-consent messaging is harmful bullshit) fall back on the idea that parents need to teach their children good manners, and that kids need to listen to their parents. But no one is saying you can’t tell your child, “Go say hi to Grandpa” or “Thank your aunt for her gift.” Physical intimacy isn’t the only way adults show love and gratitude to other adults, after all! There are plenty of alternatives. Maybe your kid is more comfortable with high fives than hugs—there you go! You can always ask your child, “Do you want to hug Grandma?” This may require dealing with Grandma’s disappointment, but you can always just send her this article. A CNN article from 2015 offers the parental line, “I would like you to hug Grandma, but I won’t make you do it.” (That article’s title, “I Don’t Own My Child’s Body,” is also a good reminder.) There’s a line between polite social interaction and physical contact, and that’s an important lesson to teach early and often. The holidays are the perfect chance.","When the Girl Scouts put out a pre-holiday reminder to parents that their daughters don’t owe anyone a hug, even at the holidays, it was taken as a sign of the (dismal) times. “At a time when issues of sexual harassment and consent are in the news,” began the…",2017-11-22T17:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",Why You Shouldn’t Force Your Kids to Hug Relatives,https://offspring.lifehacker.com/why-you-shouldn-t-force-your-kids-to-hug-relatives-1820677682,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--YLozm5bO--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/sbyk5eojimakux7bykso.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,force,1

Nick Summers,"The concept is listed under a section called ""aspirations for PHV (private hire vehicle) services."" It is, therefore, a polite request, rather than a proper rule right now. Still, TfL says cryptically: ""This section also highlights where we will seek further regulatory change in the future."" So there's a chance this policy will be written into law some day. For now, the specifics are unclear — such a move would be controversial, for instance, if passengers could filter based on race and sexuality too. TfL has made clear, however, that its intention is to ""improve safety and customer service."" Uber, if you need a reminder, lost its licence in London last September. The company has appealed the decision -- the resolution could take ""years,"" apparently -- and is free to operate in the meantime. Much of TfL's gripes concern how the company reports serious crime and conducts driver background checks. These are reiterated in its policy statement today. It calls on ride-hailing companies to provide ""clear policies and action for the prevention and reporting of offences,"" and processes so that ""any allegation of crime is reported to the police and TfL in a timely fashion."" To make this a reality, it says ""further change"" may be required to licensing legislation.

Andy Greenberg,"In 2019, an indictment of Iranian hackers targeting American government officials barely raises an eyebrow. But in one remarkable case, those hackers had an unusual advantage: the alleged help of an American defector with a top secret clearance.
On Wednesday, the Department of Justice announced charges against Monica Elfriede Witt, a former Air Force counterintelligence officer who, the indictment claims, was recruited by the Iranian government to spill highly classified information, some of which was then used by Iranian hackersfour of whom are also chargedto target Witt's former US government colleagues. The charges represent a rare defection of an American military officer to become an active participant in another country's espionage operations.
Witt allegedly helped exposed the identity of an active US agent, as well as the code name and classified details of a secret US counterintelligence operation, all in service of Iran.
""The case unsealed today underscores the dangers to our intelligence professionals, and the lengths our adversaries will go to identify them, expose them, target them, and in a few rare cases ultimately turn them against the nation they swore to protect,"" assistant attorney general John Demers said in a press conference. ""Espionage by past or current members of the intelligence community poses a threat to our country, and a heightened danger to their former colleagues.""
The indictment against Witt tells the story of an American former military officer and contractor slowly drawn into Iran's influence over the course of several years. Finally, in 2014 and 2015, she allegedly became an active participant in Iranian espionage operations, helping the four hackers named in the indictmentMojtaba Masoumpour, Behzad Mesri, Hossein Parvar, and Mohamad Paryarto hone honeypot attacks via email and social media phishing that targeted eight of her former colleagues.
Switching Sides
Witt spent a decade as an Air Force intelligence specialist, and then two years working for a contractor left unnamed in the indictment. Afterward, in early 2012, Witt allegedly traveled to Iran to attend an all-expenses-paid ""Hollywoodism"" conference held by an Iranian group known as New Horizons, which the Justice Department describes as focused on anti-American propaganda, including anti-semitism and Holocaust denial. According to the organization's website, its conferences focus on topics including ""Muslims in Europe, Islamophobia, Iranophobia, Discriminations, US State hostility towards Afro-Americans, Zionist Lobby,"" and ""911."" Around the same time, the indictment says, Witt appeared in videos broadcast on Iranian TV criticizing the US government and converting to Islam.
Three months later, the FBI says it warned Witt she was a target for Iranian recruitment. Just weeks after that warning, she was hired by an Iranian-American based in Tehranwhom the indictment labels ""Individual A""to work on a film the indictment describes as a documentary with an anti-American bent. The following year, Witt attended the ""Hollywoodism"" conference again. The Treasury Department joined in Wednesday's press conference to announce new sanctions against New Horizons, as well as an unnamed private firm that employed the hackers she aided.
The indictment details messages Witt allegedly sent to Individual A documenting her transition. ""I am endeavoring to put the training I received to good use instead of evil,"" she wrote, adding a smiling emoji. ""Thanks for giving me the opportunity.""
They allegedly created a persona named Bella Wood, in an attempt to trick US agents into installing malware.
After her second trip to the New Horizons conference in 2013, Witt allegedly began telling her Iranian-American contact that she was ready to defect, or, as she described it in messages included in the indictment, become a WikiLeaks-style whistleblower. ""If all else fails, I may just go public with a program and do like Snowden :),"" she wrote. A week later, she allegedly told Individual A she had ""told all"" to representatives in the Iranian embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. Not long after that, apparently frustrated with the suspicion and lack of action from the Iranians, she described a plan to ""slip into Russia quietly"" and contact WikiLeaks.
Ultimately, it appears that Individual A did help Witt arrange a meeting with Iranian officials in Dubai, and finally defect to Tehran.
Once she'd settled in Iran, Witt worked actively for the Iranian government, the indictment charges, telling them classified details of a sensitive ""special access project""only elliptically described in the indictmentand its specific target. Over the next two years, she allegedly helped search Facebook for details of US agents she had previously worked with, assembled ""target packages"" that provided profiles of the agents for Iranian hackers, and sharing even the name of one active agent in a compromising position, endangering that agent's life, according to assistant attorney general Demers.
Bella Wood
The Iranian hackers, according to the indictment, used Witt's target profiles to send phishing emails and social media messages to her former colleagues, including one based in Afghanistan. They allegedly created a persona named Bella Wood, in an attempt to trick US agents into installing malware that would monitor their computer activities, steal passwords, and access their webcam.
""I'll send you a file including my photos but u should deactivate your antivirus to open it,"" one email from the Bella Wood character read. ""I hope you enjoy the photos I designed for the new year, they should opened in your computer honey."" In other cases, the hackers sent links spoofing news stories at sites they controlled, as well as fake password reset pages in an attempt to steal Facebook passwords, though it's not clear if any of the intended victims fell for those ruses.
The FBIs wanted poster for Witt states only that she may be in Southwest Asiahardly a promising sign that shell ever be arrested by American authorities. But as in the growing stack of cases where the US Department of Justice indicts foreign hackers and spies, the FBI and Justice Department says they intend the charges to telegraph a message to anyone who might attempt to follow in her or her handlers footsteps.
Today should serve as a warning to those who seek out our current and former national security personnel for the sensitive information they have, and to those individuals themselves, said FBI executive assistant director Jay Tabb in Wednesdays press conference. Unlike Witt, we take the oaths we swear seriously, and we will continue to pursue those who do not.

Jon Fingas,"King argued that a law was necessary as officials had ""not seen enough progress"" through the existing approach. Europeans ""cannot afford to relax or become complacent"" in dealing with extremism, he added. The EU is poised to publish the draft legislation in September. The European Parliament and individual member nations would still have to wait for the finished proposal and vote on it before it could take effect, so it may be months later before there's any definitive action. This won't necessarily be a challenge for major sites. YouTube noted that it often catches terrorist videos before authorities have even had a chance to flag them, and these companies are large enough that they can recruit more content moderators if necessary. It could be a more problematic demand for smaller sites, though, as they'll need to respond just as quickly as their larger counterparts without the same. A law could help by encouraging sites to think about anti-extremist strategies from the get go, but it might also create logistical headaches for sites with limited staff and tight budgets.","The European Union is no longer convinced that self-policing is enough to purge online extremist content.

Jonathan Shieber,"In a surprise announcement today at the third meeting of the White House’s newly reconvened Space Council, President Donald J. Trump announced his intention to create a new Space Force within the U.S. Armed Forces. “We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force — separate but equal. It is going to be something. So important,” the President said. Defense Secretary James “Mad Dog” Mattis has already voiced opposition to the creation of new branch of the military last year when the idea was first proposed by Congress. Congressional leadership first floated the creation of sixth branch of the armed forces focused on space combat (sadly, not against invading alien insects though ) last year… and Mattis promptly blasted the idea. In a letter to Ohio Representative Mike Turner, one of the leaders of the Space Corps initiative in Congress, Mattis wrote: “At a time when we are trying to integrate the Department’s joint warfighting functions, I do not wish to add a separate service that would likely present a narrower and even parochial approach to space operations.” Apparently, the President has come around on the subject in the intervening months. Trump is now “directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately being the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the armed forces.” The House Armed Services Committee began pushing for the creation of a space corps last year as part of the last spending authorization bill for the military. The new military force would fall under the purview of the Air Force in the same way that Marines work with the Navy, according to the proposal. That spending authorization bill was ultimately approved, but the space corps proposal was left on the cutting floor. Now the proposal is taking flight at the highest levels of the Trump Administration. The newly reconvened Space Council is helmed by Vice President Mike Pence. At today’s announcement were celebrity astronauts like Jack Schmitt, Buzz Aldrin, and Eileen Collins. Also in attendance were Gwynne Shotwell, Wes Bush of Northrup Grumman, and Bob Smith, the chief executive of Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. “When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space,” the President said. For the President, the establishment of the Space Force is of a piece with a strategy to create a lasting American presence on the Moon — and eventually Mars. “This time, we will do more than plant our flag and leave our footprints. We will establish a long-term presence, expand our economy, and build the foundation for the eventual mission to Mars — which is actually going to happen very quickly,” Trump said. “And, you know, I’ve always said that rich guys seem to like rockets. So all of those rich guys that are dying for our real estate to launch their rockets, we won’t charge you too much. Just go ahead. If you beat us to Mars, we’ll be very happy and you’ll be even more famous.” The announcement also put to rest any questions about where the Trump Administration would move policy around space exploration. “I am instructing my administration to embrace the budding commercial space industry,” Trump said. “We are modernizing out-of-date space regulations. They’re way out of date. They haven’t been changed in many, many years. And today we’re taking one more step to unleash the power of American ingenuity.”","In a surprise announcement today at the third meeting of the White House’s newly reconvened Space Council, President Donald J.

Zhou Hanhua,"The Sino-US trade war is hurting companies on both sides of the conflict. In early January, the US stock market dropped sharply after Apple issued its first revenue warning in 16 years, citing weak sales in China. Several weeks later, chipmaker Nvidia cut its quarterly revenue expectations by $500 million for the same reason. A survey last year by the US-China Business Council showed that 28 percent of US companies reported increased scrutiny from Chinese regulators because of trade friction. Even American cherry growers are being affected, losing $89 million in sales last year.
WIRED OPINION
ABOUT
Zhou Hanhua is vice president of the Law institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Meanwhile Huawei, a Chinese supplier of telecommunications equipment, has become the target of a US campaign to bar its gear from many global markets. Huawei has invested heavily in 5G, the fifth-generation wireless technology that will connect self-driving cars and other complex digital systems to the internet. Washington says putting Huawei gear into these systems would create a national security threat because the Chinese government could use Huawei gear to eavesdrop or launch a cyberattack. It has barred Huawei from selling to large US telecom operators and is pressuring its allies to exclude the companys equipment from their 5G networks.
Huawei has consistently denied that it threatens anyone. In the companys 30-year history, no evidence has ever shown its gear to be less secure than equipment made by Ericsson, Nokia, or Samsung. Huaweis founder, Ren Zhengfei, recently told a roomful of reporters that the Chinese government had never asked him to put spyware in Huaweis equipment and that he would rather shut the company down than comply with any such request.
Huaweis opponents say that regardless of its intentions, Chinese law would force the company to insert backdoors in its network gear if the government ordered it to do so. To support this claim, they cite an Intelligence Law passed by Chinas legislature, the National Peoples Congress, in June 2017.
But attorneys from Clifford Chance, a global law firm headquartered in London, have a different perspective. Asked to review an analysis of the Intelligence Law done last year by Zhong Lun, an international law firm in Beijing, Clifford Chance attorneys independently assessed Zhong Luns analysis of Chinese laws governing counterespionage, anti-terrorism, cybersecurity, and national intelligence.
Their unambiguous conclusion: Nowhere does Chinese law give Beijing the authority to compel telecommunication equipment firms to install backdoors or listening devicesor to engage in any behavior that might compromise network security.
Why, then, do so many news reports say otherwise?
Some Chinese statutes, such as the Counter Terrorism Law, do require telecommunications service providers to help state security agencies detect illegal activities and terrorism. But such laws are comparable to those enacted by other countries, including the United States.

The WIRED Guide to 5G
Chinas laws also distinguish between companies that actually run the networksproviding phone or internet connectionsand those that make network equipment, as Huawei does. While telecom operators and internet service providers might be legally bound to help government authorities, Huawei is not.
Clifford Chance also concluded that the laws do not appear to have extraterritorial effect. They do not apply to Huaweis subsidiaries, operations, or employees outside of China.
Article 3 of China's criminal code says that any act that no explicit stipulation of law deems a crime is not to be convicted or given punishment. Chinas Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated clearly that no Chinese law obliges any company to install backdoors, so no company can be held criminally responsible for refusing to install backdoors. If Huawei were to receive this type of request and refuse to act on it, the company would not be subject to legal penalty.
To summarize: No Chinese laws compel the installation of backdoors or other spyware. If Huawei refused a request to spy, its executives would not face imprisonment.
If evidence against Huawei exists, the US should present it, allowing governments to make an informed decision about whether to work with the company. Whatever they decide, policymakers should not be swayed by the argument that under Chinese law, Huawei can be ordered to plant backdoors in its equipment. No such law exists.

Nicholas Thompson,"Will Roper, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics, is something like Q for the Defense Department. He formerly ran the Strategic Capabilities Office, a secretive military skunkworks designed to figure out how to fight future wars. While there, he helped design swarms of tiny unmanned drones; he helped create Project Maven; and he tried to partner the Defense Department with the videogame industry. Now his new job may be even harder: Making the Air Force acquisitions process efficient.
Hes going to be leading a pitch day for the Air Force this week in New York City, and he spoke with WIRED about that and also where he sees the future of military technology goingfrom AI to hypersonic weapons to space.
(This interview has been condensed and edited.)
Nicholas Thompson: You're launching a new system very soon to help get startups very quickly signed up to Air Force contracts. Tell me how it works and why you are doing it.
Will Roper: We've got to be able to work with the entire industry base, and even our fastest agreements still take a couple of months to get nailed down. Thats too long for a startup that needs cash flow quickly. And so we really worked hard to hack our system and weve gotten down to where we can do credit-card-based awards on a single day. That's what we're going to try to demonstrate in New York. We're obviously not investing in startupswere going to put them on projects where they're going to deliver technology to the Air Force. But we want it to feel like they're pitching to a venture capitalist.
NT: And so, specifically, it means that I will come to you with an idea, youll vet the idea, and if you agree, you will pay me right there on a Pentagon credit card?
WR: Well pay you right then and there. If you have a PayPal account, then you can work with the Air Force.
NT: What is the credit limit on the Air Force's credit card?
WR: Were going to start by doing awards at $158,000 per transaction. We did a round of practice trials prior to going up to New York City. So we had a hundred companies come and give us ideas, and we were able to award 104 contracts in 40 hours using our credit card swipes. And theyre triaged into phases: Phase one are small awards, phase two are bigger awards, phase three even bigger. And rather than do it the normal government way, which is to do a traditional contract in a single-time, upfront cash award, we're going to do them in installment payments over time. The resounding feedback we've gotten from the small companies is that it's so much better for them to be able to tell investors and stakeholders that they're going to have consistent cash flow over time.
NT: Yep. What is an example of one of the ideas that you agreed to fund?
WR: We've had companies that have proposed AI solutions to help us with predictive maintenance. We want to predict maintenance issues before they occur. Well, that's an AI problem. Weve gone operational on two systems: the C-5, which is a large cargo plane that moves stuff all around the world. It has over 105 algorithms that are operational today already predicting things we would have never found until after the fact. And the B-1 bomber: It has 40 algorithms that are operating. Were finding issues with landing gear and wheels long before they would be inspected. So this kind of digital oracle is something we're excited about. We're hoping that at Pitch Day in New York we're going to get a lot more companies that are looking at the maintenance side of the house, not just development.
NT: So, for example, there might be a company that has expertise in how wheels fray, it would analyze the data on takeoffs and landings, and it would predict when you need to replace part of the wheel in the C-5?
WR: They don't even have to be an expert in our systems. If they're an expert in data analytics and machine learning, they really just need access to our data so that they can tell us what patterns it sees in the data.
NT: And predictive maintenance is, if I recall, the first place where the Pentagon started using AI, is that correct?
WR: Actually the first place we started was back in Project Maven. That was a project that I started at SCO, which proposed to try to get people out of the business of watching full motion video and use AI to recognize targets. And we started working with a variety of stakeholders in the intelligence community. Google was working with us and, as you know, that ended up going in a different direction.
NT: The reason why predictive maintenance is an early AI application is because there are steady data streams, because it's an area of huge investment, and because it's relatively low riskat least for a Pentagon operationin that it doesn't involve combat?
WR: Yeah, I think you have all the nails on the head. There's really no downside to doing it. The data is available. There's a mission imperative. It's not sensitive, we're not talking about classified data, and there's no operational risk. And when there's no downside, even the sclerotic bureaucracy of the Defense Department can manage to fast-track those things.
NT: The reason Project Maven was an early use is because AI is so good at image recognition?
WR: Exactly. Computer vision came along quickly because of commercial applications. It was obvious that things that were inherent on smartphones, recognizing faces and pictures, could be applied to our intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission. We wanted to get people out of the brute-force task of finding targets, and move them into the business of recognizing targets of interest that were identified by AI. We werent trying to shift people out of the loop; we just wanted them doing higher-order tasks.
NT: Was Google's announcement that it would depart when its contract ended something that was a major blow or something that was quickly passed over?
WR: I would say it was a surprise. But there are many companies working in computer vision. In acquisition, we are used to having to switch between vendors based on a variety of issues, so it was really no big deal in terms of what people are trained to do. But I think there's a broader issue, which is just wanting to make sure that we have as many open doors as possible to work with us.
NT: Lets talk theoretically about Maven and something you said a minute ago, which is that Maven took humans out of the business of just scanning endless video and moved them to a higher-level task. But you can imagine AI doing that higher-level task, and the one above that, and even identifying targets or carrying out a mission. Where do you stop using AI and say that humans have to be involved?
WR: Our policy right now is that lethal decisions are always retained by people. And I don't see that policy changing anytime soon. I think the only thing that would raise the discussion is if there were just simply no way to compete without thinking about other options. But I don't really see a future where humans are going to be out of the loop. We're just going to be increasingly out of the loop on brute-force tasks.
""We're not only in a competition with other nations, we're in a period where technology changes at a rate it never has before. And the development system that we currently use in the Pentagon is simply one of the Cold War.""
Will Roper
You could imagine right now that AI does a pretty good job identifying houses and cars of a different type and that, in the future, you might go from recognizing your car to the type of car, and then the type of car to a specific car. But I don't think this nation is going to want to take lethal decisions out of the hands of people. You can't ask AI why it made a choice. It made the choice because that's what its training data said, and that's not a sufficient answer for most people. We want to be able to judge the judgment of someone making a decision, and AI doesn't give us that ability.
NT: Let me speculate for a second more, though. We're not that far off from a time when AI is definitively better at image recognition than a human. And I can totally see the argument why youd always want a human to make an offensive lethal decision. But what if you flip it around? What if it's a missile defense system? Would you still want a human in the loop to make a decision to shoot down an incoming missile even if we knew that AI would be better and quicker at recognizing it?
WR: I think those things will fall into a different category. I dont see it as being an issue if you have to hand a decision over to a weapons system when theres an incoming ballistic missile or cruise missile. But I think when we're making a decision about human targets, there is going to be a desire to hold the deciding entity accountable for what they've done. And in order to even think about having AI move up into that level of judgment, we're going to need a different kind of AI because we'll need to understand not just what it recommends but why it recommends it. Step one for the Air Force is, we've got to learn how to use the AI that exists today smartly. And until we start pushing it into programs and learning what's easy and hard, we're keeping it in the world of speculation. I've joked with the Air Force that you can't spell Air Force without AI.
NT: Explainability is becoming a pretty hot debate in AI, and there are a bunch of people, very smart people, who say, you know, explainability is an unfair standard. If you ask a human why they made a decision, they can give you a story, but it might not really be why they made a decision. And so if we are demanding explainability on our AI algorithms, A) well be much slower and B) we might be setting them to a standard beyond even what we set humans.
WR: No, I agree. Im glad the researchers are working on explainability, but there's no guarantee it will happen. So maybe rather than have explainable AI or auditable AI, maybe it's just AI that can do research and fill in its training set when it makes mistakesan AI that continues to learn and research. Weve got to get something down a level from just simply giving us the best pattern match, and I'm glad that our research labs are working on it. I'm glad that commercial industry is working on it.
NT: And how much do you worry that having burdens of explainability, making sure that humans are always in the loop, will slow down United States military advancement? And that, if we're setting all these rules and standards and requirements, and China or Russia is not, they will press ahead in this fast-moving technology?
WR: I worry every day, Nick. Our long-term competitiveness is my No. 1 worry, and it's the pace of technology change that drives that worry. We're not only in a competition with other nations, we're in a period where technology changes at a rate it never has before. And the development system that we currently use in the Pentagon is simply one of the Cold War. It moves in decade-long moves. And we now need to be able to make changes on a yearly basis. So I worry about anything that gives us the excuse to wait another year before we take this seriously.
The reason whythe whole focus I brought into this job is simply trying to accelerate the process at which we buy and build things, which is a huge undertaking. But I've been pleased so far with how the Air Force has been able to accelerate. Step one: Let's get airman out of brute-force tasks and get our highly trained, highly capable airmen into higher-order thinking. That ought to be a sufficient first step to get us in the game. To your point, it's the first step in a long journey, and we can't get tired soon.
NT: And what is the most impressive AI you've seen from Russia and China? Are there specific advances that you've seen that make you sleep even less well?
WR: Well, I can't comment on the specifics of any country. I will say that China's announcement of its megaprojects should give us pause. If another nation sees the importance of AI for its economic competitiveness, its military competitiveness, we have to at least match that seriousness, if not eclipse it.
NT: I mean, it seems like the whole way the Pentagon works, with specific, precise commands being followed in specific, precise ways, is pretty complicated for AI.
WR: It is. I mean, the system that we've inherited out of the Cold War is accustomed to being able to forecast the threat, identify its strengths and weaknesses, and develop the countermeasures to them. That's how the Cold War was won. And as much as people knock the system, it did win the Cold War. So we can say it was sufficient for the challenge of its time.
But now, let's look at this century, let's look at this decade. Would you believe it if I told you what the 2030 threat to the Air Force is? Would you believe me? You probably wouldn't. Because technology is changing so rapidly the threat could go in a variety of ways. Technologies can mature we don't even know today. AI is a capability that evolves the more you use it. So the longer that we wait to get it fielded, the longer it's going to take us to start evolving it to be better, which is eroding our competitiveness against an adversary that has the forethought to do that. AI is a wonderful capability to make you more reactive without having to build a completely new system to get a new capability. We've got to get into the game now and make opponents react to what we're doing, so that we always had that first-mover advantage. Its the only way I see to be able to stay ahead in a future that's not predictable.
NT: So the challenge for you, and for the department more generally, is to not necessarily be more accurate in predicting precise threats but to make the whole Defense Department, and the Air Force specifically, more adaptive. That way, whatever the threat evolves into, we can respond better.
WR: Yes. Maybe in the future AI is going to be the most significant technology for militaries, maybe it's quantum systems, maybe it's synthetic biology. It could be any of those things. There's strong evidence that all of those are going to be game-changers in the future. But can you predict which one is going to be the game-changer first? Well, if you can, then come work for the Air Force! We need clairvoyants in our camps. But if we can't, then we've got to be more adaptive than any military. Whatever the technology is that comes out of the commercial world, we've got to be able to take it, apply it, and get it into the hands of people who can use it. It's one reason why we are working on things like Pitch Day.
NT: So let's talk a little bit about the threats that could potentially face the Air Force in 2030. For example, will there be self-flying fighter jets?
WR: Oh, I hope so. Thats something I have dearly hoped to be able to push and start while Im in this job. I think we're going to have to explore autonomy everywhere. And I don't think that the future Air Force is likely to be an Air Force of only unmanned systems, again because I think autonomous systems are going to be able to do certain things well, and people are going to be able to do different things well, and teams of them together will do things well.
NT: So do we have plans underway to develop the kind of planes that would be piloted by an AI system where you don't need a seat?
WR: So we've got a group working for us and they're working on a program called Cyborgcute namethat is exploring that concept. What do smaller, unmanned tactical air vehicles look like? How should they be built? How should we integrate them with the F-35, for instance, which is able to network with other systems. I think it'd be pretty cool to explore an F-35 that is able to control small or tactical vehicles that are around it or ahead of it.
NT: And so the idea is that either you can have a fleet of these or you can have them attached to the current F-35 and you control them through sensors inside the F-35, or something else?
WR: Absolutely that's what we're thinking. The F-35 is really more than a fighterand we don't talk about this very much, but I wish we didin that it has wonderful sensing, computing, and networking capabilities. It's able to see things other things can't see, but it can share that data and it's also able to connect with other systems through a protocol that's called Open Missions Systems, OMS, and UAV Control Interface, UCI.
NT: Fascinating. Where are we on hypersonic weapons? Both in developing them and in being able to defend against them.
WR: We've come a long way. So I think that was week one in the job for me. I had been pushing the Air Force when I was at SCO to use mature technology from OSD [Office of the Secretary of Defense] hypersonic programs to accelerate their programs. Don't build it again, use what's already worked. And now that I'm Air Force acquisition, those programs report to me. So it's been great, the team is doing a great job with the acceleration.
The one that I mentioned is called Hacksaw. Its a Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon and it is on the path to being the department's first operational hypersonic weapon. We are 22 months away from full operational flight test, with early operational capability one year after. From the time you test there are other things you have to docertifying, trainingbefore we did declare it as a capability. But 22 months is wicked fast. So, knock on wood, this nation will have a hypersonic weapon in about two years.
NT: And what about the ability to defend against hypersonic weapons?
WR: So that's the initiative that's being taken on by Missile Defense Agency. Hypersonic weapons are challenging because they fly low. So they're underif you just look at curvature of the Earth, the hypersonic weapon that's boosting gliding stays much lower than a ballistic missile, so it's harder for radars that are constrained by curvature of the Earth to pick them up. There are concepts to try to track hypersonic weapons from space that are being explored. They're very much in the S&amp;T phase, but they ought to be explored. We should never quit trying to solve challenges. But those are probably a step further than programs I'm going to start while I'm in this job.
NT: And what about using AI for war planning, for laying out how to actually engage in combat?
WR: Thats a great idea, I've never thought of that to be honest. Makes a lot of sense. You could imagine doing tons and tons of permutations. One of our programs is the Minuteman replacement program, its called Ground Based Strategic Deterrent. It's an $80 billion procurement, so its huge. It places all of the ICBMs we have. It has these wonderful digital engineering tools that allow our team to explore millions of designs. It has some some analytic capability that allows optimization. I wouldn't call it full AI, but the hopes are there that if we took the next step, that it would be.
And I can imagine having something very similar in a war plan. The ICBM systems extremely complicated, so if you make a design change, having the computer tell you not just what the performance is going to be like but what the cost is going to beit's just eye-watering and in the future I want every program to have tools like that. They're worth their weight in gold, but I think it does make sense for our war planners to have that. So great idea! I'm going to go see if I can find the right place to plant it in the Air Force.
NT: Let's talk about the Space Force for a second. Tell me what you are looking for in the Space Force. If somebody is coming to Pitch Day and they're fascinated by space, what are some of the areas where you'll be building?
WR: Well, space is critically important and we can't treat space as if its an off-limits domain. Too much of the military support comes from space: We do communications from there; we do GPS; we do sensing from there. So the idea that those targets are off limits is simply not feasible or wise. A lot of our economy flows through space. I imagine most people don't think about the fact that they can't live a day of their life without reliance on space, whether it's cheap GPS for navigating, or weather. It comes from Air Force satellites in space communications. So, so much of our lives are tied to space. We're all people of space whether we want to think it or not, so I'm glad that we're having the discussion that we need to be ready for conflict to go there.
As the acquisition exec for the Air Force, we have to start building space systems that are ready to deal with space being a hostile environment. And that's the work we're doing now. We're focusing on making sure systems are resilient, that they can survive and fight through threats that will try to take them out.
NT: Last question. What else do you want to see on Pitch Day in two weeks?
WR: I hope we'll see ideas across a wide variety of missions. I hope we'll have a lot of software companies that can come help us for both software development and also improvement of how we do software. I hope that we're going to see additive manufacturing companies. There is a huge potential for companies that are working in additive manufacturing to work with the Air Force. And the great thing about working with us is we don't have any IP. When we push a new technique in partnership with a company, they get to see it. They get to use it. And I certainly hope we'll get more predictive maintenance ideas. We don't have enough of it yet. I would like to see what predictive maintenance across a whole fleet of aircraft does.
But the other thing I'm hoping for, Nick, to be honest, is that I find some things I didn't know I needed. I hope you can use these as a place or a magnet for good ideas that we're not smart enough to request. So I hope to be able to tell you afterwards that I was surprised and pleased. I'm sure I will be.
NT: All right, great. Well, good luck and thank you so much for taking the time to talk me through all of this. This was really fun.
WR: Hey, thanks, Nick. Anytime.

George Dvorsky,"Earlier today, President Donald Trump signed a directive to create the Space Force, what will become the sixth branch of the U.S. militarybut the new branch will be placed under the purview of the U.S. Air Force, rather than being a separate and autonomous branch, as the president had initially hoped.
Back in June 2018, Trump announced his intention to create the Space Force, saying it would become the sixth independent branch of the U.S. military by 2020 and that it would be separate but equal. The Space Forcethe first new branch of the military in more than seven decadeswould allow the U.S. to keep pace with China and Russia, he said, both of which are developing space-based weaponry. In August, Vice President Mike Pence told a Pentagon audience that space has become a warfighting domain like land, air, and sea, requiring a branch dedicated to protecting U.S. interests and assets in space. 
The directive signed today orders the creation of the Space Force, but itll be a slimmer, less-autonomous version than the one initially described, at least at first. 
The president has directed the Secretary of Defense to draft a legislative proposal that, if enacted, would establish the U.S. Space Force as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces within the Department of the Air Force. This is a step toward a future, separate military department for space, a senior White House administrative official reportedly told journalists earlier today, according to The Hill.
The new version of the Space Force should be more palatable to members of Congress, some of whom have expressed concerns that the new branch would introduce unnecessary bureaucratic bloat and massive costs. The Air Force should also find it more appetizing, as it gets to monitor the new division while retaining its reach into space. In September, a leaked Air Force document claimed the proposed Space Force would cost $13 billion over five years, as opposed to the $8 billion cited by the Trump administration. 
In addition to falling under the purview of the Air Force, the pared-down Space Force will require the Pentagon to consolidate its existing functions to minimize duplication of effort and eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies, the White House official explained. Anyone currently working on space defense, whether military or civilian, will be moved to the Space Force. The branch will get its own four-star general, who will serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and an Air Force undersecretary for spacea civilian positionwill confirmed by the Senate, The Hill reports. 
Itll take years to create the Space Force, as well as several phases of implementation, the official said. The price tag for the new Space Force headquarters should be less than $100 million, but costs are not yet set in stone. The White House official said money for the Space Force will be included in the administrations proposed budget for 2020, adding that theres still enough time to get the proposed order into the current years defense policy bill. Of course, Trumps idea still needs to go through hearings, which have yet to be scheduled. The White House official was optimistic that the proposal will be sent to Congress before budget submissions are due in mid-March. 
Importantly, Trumps updated directive doesnt mean the administration has lost sight of its original goal of creating a separate but equal branch of the U.S. Armed Forces dedicated to space. 
We havent abandoned that goal, and in fact were achieving, I think with this directive, the presidents number one objective, which is a separate armed service, the White House official said. Weve heard the concerns from Congress about not creating a large bureaucratic organization, and I think our thought was if we start going directly to a military department, which I think is our desired end state, then we would spend a lot of time dealing with bureaucracy and structure and not focusing on war fighting.
From here, the proposal goes to Congress. Given these changes, the House could very well pass the order, as some members have supported the idea in the past.

"Aimée Lutkin on Offspring, shared by Aimée Lutkin to Lifehacker","The gender wage gap isnt just a problem the work force is grappling with; it starts at home with how you treat your kids.
Statistically, the gap between what men earn over women varies depending on race and location; women of color earn significantly less than white men and white women. Women with children are also more likely to be penalized financially in the workplace, whereas fathers tend to have higher salaries that their childless counterparts.

The cause of this discrepancy is hotly debated, but most women have their own anecdotes about times they were overlooked for a promotion or discovered they made significantly less than their male co-workers. There is now further evidence that sexism is baked into how were taught about moneyturns out, theres even a gender wage gap among children.
Fast Company reports that a survey conducted of 1,000 parents by Giftcards.com revealed that how parents teach their kids about money is extremely gendered, and that girls in general receive far less money from gifts, chores, and allowance than boys:
For example, 61% of boys received a lesson from their parents on credit scores by the time they reached high school, compared with 46% of girls. Boys were also 9% more likely to be taught how to pay taxes, 5% more likely to be taught about bank accounts, 3% more likely to be taught about credit cards, and 2% more likely to receive an education on investing.
Boys were generally encouraged to focus on building wealth, while girls were given lessons on budgeting and tracking spending. Children also tend to receive their money lessons from the adult of the same gender, passing down lessons about money that they got from previous generations. The generations that built and maintained the wage gap.
So how do you avoid making this mistake with kids?
Question your own attitude towards money
If youre in charge of teaching your kids about cash, be sure youre aware of your own approach to it, and examine any internal biases you have about how you think youre allowed to spend. Greg McBride, Bankrate.coms chief financial analyst, told Fast Company that men tend to be overly confident with their investments and think theyre doing better than they are.
The tendency for women to trade less frequently, to be more risk-adverse, and to be more focused on the long haul are byproducts of longer lifespans, the greater likelihood of having to support themselves and their children on one income, and a greater likelihood of outliving a spouse, he says.
If you have a partner, make sure youre on the same page and all your kids are getting the same lessons. 
Make sure allowances are fair
This may seem like a no-brainerif you have a boy and a girl who are around the same age, they should be receiving the same amount in allowance. But what seems fair as an idea isnt always whats actually practiced, and these numbers are startling:
The study also found that girls receive less money from their parents, with boys in high school and elementary school getting roughly $20 more on Christmas, $3 more for completing chores, and $1 more for allowance.
Do you pay your kids more for certain types of chores? Have you stratified allowances based on age, without consideration for gender? When birthdays and holidays come around, think about what kinds of gifts youre getting for the kids as part of an overall investment in them; if you have relatives who routinely give money, make sure its the same amount. That might be an awkward conversation, but who gets what sends a message that can reverberate throughout your kids lives.
Consider your own example
Parenting is hard on its own and being stressed out by finances makes everything worse. But your kids are absorbing everything you express about money, regardless of gender. Be aware of what you say about work, cash flow, and financial problems. 
Theres so many parents who will offhandedly make these money-negative statements like, Were so broke, or, The taxman takes everything, but a kid is going to take that at face value, adds Paula Pant, the founder of AffordAnything.com. If parents can instead make extremely thoughtful remarks, like, In a year and a half wed like to all go to Hawaii for a week, heres how were thinking about it in advance, those types of conversations are quite useful, she says.
In general, we want our kids to be better people than we are. We insist they eat their vegetables

Rhett Allain,"When you wander around the internet, sometimes you can find some crazy stuff. Check this out: It's an old account of a weird phenomena created by giant plastic sheets at 3M Corporation. In short, these fast-moving, electrically-charged plastic sheets created some type of effect that prevented humans from passing through an invisible wall. It sounds a lot like some type of force field, right? I'm honestly skeptical that this is real, but let's just assume that it actually happened. If so, there are some parts of this that show some cool physics that I know are real—and even better, some of this you can try at home. Can you electrically charge stuff with plastic? Yes, this is possible. It's called the triboelectric effect and it's what you see when your socks get a electrostatic charge after being in the dryer. The basic cause is through frictional contact between two different materials—but there's probably something a little different going on here. It turns out that pulling apart (not just rubbing) two materials can also create a separation of charge. Here is a simple demonstration of this effect that you can do at home. Get some clear sticky tape (really any brand will probably work). Pull off a piece of tape from the roller—make it about 10-20 cm long (a little longer than a pencil). Fold one end of the tape over itself so that you make a little ""handle"" on the top. Now stick this tape onto some hard surface—like a table. If you want you can write a label on the handle of this tape. Write something like ""L"" for lower. Next repeat this with another tape about the same size and place it on top of the ""L"" tape. Write ""U"" on the upper tape for upper. After putting the two tapes on top of each other, pull them up from the lower tape so that they are still together. You should have something that looks like this. You are ready for the physics. Grab the two tapes by their handles and pull them apart rapidly. Like this. Boom. You just made two tapes with opposite electric charges—you can tell because the two tapes are now attracted to each other. But what is happening? I'm not 100 percent sure, but essentially when the two tapes are ripped apart, some electric charges (probably electrons) are attracted more to one tape than to the other tape. This leaves one of the tapes with excess electrons and an overall negative charge and the other tape with a deficiency of electrons and an overall positive charge. How do you know which tape is positive and which one is negative? Actually, it's not so easy to figure this out—also, for some brands of sticky tape the U-tape is positive and for some brands the U-tape is negative. If you really want to figure out which tape is negative, you need to bring it near another known charge. If it repels, it's negative. If you make another set of tapes (another U-tape and another L-tape), you can see something even cooler. What happens when you bring two U-tapes close together? The two U-tapes have the same electrical charge so that they repel. When two objects repel, they have to have the same charge. But when objects attract, it doesn't necessarily mean they have opposite charges. However, it is quite clear that you can get tapes (or plastics) to have an excess electrical charge. The sticky tape version of electrical charging is great since it works well even when the air is humid. Can charged objects interact with neutral objects? One part of the crazy 3M invisible wall story is that it somehow pushes back humans. This invisible wall could not just be caused by excess (even super-charged) plastic. The problem is that electric charges can attract neutral objects, but they can not repel them. Let's start with a demonstration. Take one of your electrically charged tapes (it doesn't matter which one) and also tear up some paper into tiny pieces (you just need a few). Put the torn-up paper on your table and then bring your charged tape over them. Here's what happens. The charged paper attracts the neutral paper. It's pretty awesome if you think about it—oh, and it should work with either tape. Go ahead and try it. But why is there an interaction between the tape and the paper? The answer is that the neutral paper still has electric charges (protons and electrons). In order to explain how this works, I am going to assume the tape is negatively charged. When it comes near the neutral paper, the negative tape pushes on the negative charges in the paper and pulls on the positive charge. This results in a very slight charge separation in the paper. Since the electric force between charges decreases with distance, the attraction between the positive charges and the tape is greater than the repulsive forces between the negative charges. The net effect is an attraction between the negative tape and the neutral paper. The only way to get two objects to be electrically repulsed is by having them the same charge. So something else must be going on with the weird 3M invisible wall. What about ionized air? Here is the theory from Bill Beaty to explain the 3M invisible wall: Maybe the sheets of plastic produced ionized air that created the wall. Ionized air is just molecules of oxygen or nitrogen that either have an extra electron or lost an electron to make them electrically charged. This charged air could then be repelled by the parts of the plastic with the same charge and attracted to the opposite charge plastic. Beaty's theory is that this ionized air could somehow be trapped in a particular location near the 3M plastic. This trapped ionized air would then create a air pressure differential that would act as an invisible wall. It's just so crazy, it might work. There is something even crazier you can do with sticky tape This doesn't really have anything to do with charges or walls—the only connection is that we are still talking about clear tape. Apparently you can use the tape to make X-rays. Yes, it's true. But don't worry, you aren't making X-rays every time you pull off a piece of tape. In order to get this to work, you need to peel tape off the roll while in a vacuum—and then boom, X-rays. This would be a cool challenge. See if you can build a device that pumps air out of a container and then uses sticky tape to make X-rays. Perhaps follow this up with some dental X-ray film to create an image of something cool. It would be difficult, but I think it's possible.","Can fast-moving plastic sheets create an invisible wall? Maybe, maybe not.

Adam Rogers,"If policymaking is never easy, and military policymaking is very difficult, it stands to reason that space military policymaking is basically impossible. Yet today, in a speech at the Pentagon, Vice President Mike Pence announced the formation of a sixth branch of the US armed services: a SPACE FORCE! But can that really happen? Well, let’s proceed with the go/no-go. SPACE FORCE! President Donald Trump? “ Space Force all the way! ” So that’s a GO. Vice President Mike Pence? “The time has come to establish the United States Space Force,” Pence said in his speech, asking for $8 billion to build out the idea. So that’s a GO. Congress? “We are glad that the Pentagon is finally taking these steps in enhancing our space strength,” said in a joint statement from Representatives Mike Rogers of Alabama and Jim Cooper of Tennessee, the ranking and minority leaders of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. They're authors of a bill to create a Space Force as a sixth branch of the US military. So... GO. Military? “We’re still putting it together,” Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters earlier this week. “We have the direction from the president and we are underway.” (Mattis has, in the past, opposed the idea.) So … GO? Ish? It sure sounds like we’re go for liftoff. Pence’s speech was a lot more formal that the apparently impromptu idea Trump floated in June. Today the administration announced that the Pentagon would establish not only a new military Space Command but also a Space Operations Force, drawing together the people with space-related responsibilities across the Department of Defense, and a Space Development Agency to streamline the acquisition of military space equipment—primarily, it seems, satellites and the ground hardware that goes with them. The Pentagon can do all that. But only Congress can create a new branch of the military, and a Space Force would be the first since the Air Force became a full, separate branch in 1947. It’d be a big deal. It’s also a bureaucratic challenge, and the orders to do it come at a chaotic time across government—fights over trade, farm bailouts, skyrocketing deficits, tax reductions aimed mostly at the wealthy, ethics scandals—and midterm elections in less than four months in which many polls have the president’s party on its back foot. Into that mix the president has managed to make the idea of a Space Force seem sillier than it might actually be. On Thursday, hours after the Pence speech, the Trump campaign (for president, in 2020) blasted a fundraising email asking for people to vote on a new Space Force logo, for example. One of the options says “Mars Awaits,” as if … well, as if Mars awaits. But the idea of orbital military operations didn’t start with Trump. Just about a decade after the Air Force became a separate military branch, its chief of staff General Thomas White started talking about “aerospace,” asserting that in a future of satellites and intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Air Force’s jurisdiction was “a seamless continuum stretching from the earth’s surface to infinity,” as a RAND book on the subject puts it. And in 2001, the Commission to Assess Unites States National Security Space Management and Organization published the report named after its chair Donald Rumsfeld—before he became Secretary of Defense for the second time. The “Rumsfeld Report” warned that the US was disproportionately invested in and dependent on space assets—so much so that the nation was vulnerable to a “space Pearl Harbor."" Even then, two decades ago, the report recommended a “ space corps ” and a rearrangement of the ways the military procured space-related equipment. A lot of reports since then have said the same. “They all come down to the same thing: Fragmented leadership and an inability to get the industrial base incentivized,” says a staffer for the House Armed Services Subcommittee working on the issue. Today, the staffer says, it takes up to two years to get a request for new gear out to industry, by which point the technology has moved on. So couldn’t the Air Force handle it? The USAF does indeed operate a lot of flying things, and today it’s responsible for the vast percentage of space-related military functions, like GPS and the ultra-classified X-37B long-duration space plane. Indeed, some commentators (like a former Air Force secretary and some defense analysts ) suggested that while the policy goals of a Space Force might make sense, the actual functions could just as easily fall to the existing Air Force infrastructure. (Helpfully, that wouldn’t require that anyone get a new uniform.) On the flip side, air and space are as different operational regimes as air and water. As the RAND book has it, space operations are by definition global, with no restricted airspace. Spacecraft are less maneuverable and take longer to get on station than aircraft. And with a handful of exceptions, space is uncrewed, the domain of robot cameras and transceivers. As far as anyone without a top secret clearance knows, anyway. “Are there going to be naysayers? Yes. There is, I think, a tendency for people to trivialize this because they don’t understand the technical nature of the problem,” the Armed Services Committee staffer says. “That’s a consequence of things being really classified in the the space world, which is painful for us to deal with, and it being so abstract that people are not focused on the details.” It’s also true that the US’ main international adversaries have been leaning into military space. China intentionally blew up a satellite in 2007, and Russia created its own Aerospace Force in 2015. “Both Russia and China continue to pursue anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons as a means to reduce US and allied military effectiveness,” Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coates told the Senate in February. “We assess that, if a future conflict were to occur involving Russia or China, either country would justify attacks against US and allied satellites.” All of which makes SPACE FORCE! a question of priorities and money. Military procurement is a mess. Whether that’s worth a massive bureaucratic restructuring of the Department of Defense and $8 billion will be up to a Congress in the middle of a political wildfire.

Bryan Menegus,"In a speech to military personnel in San Diego bookended by digs at former political opponent Hillary Clinton and the media, President Trump proposed a new branch of the armed forces, which he offhandedly named the “space force.” “My new national strategy for space recognizes that space is a war-fighting domain, just like the land, air and sea,” said Trump. “We may even have a ‘space force’—develop another one—space force. We have the Air Force. We’ll have the space force. We have the Army, the Navy.” Omitted from Trump’s list of armed forces branches were the Coast Guard and (presumably comprising a large part of the crowd at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar) the Marines. Trump continued by noting that the concept of a space force was one he both thought up and had previously dismissed. “I said ‘maybe we need a new force. We’ll call it the space force.’ Not really serious,” he told the crowd to mixed laughter, “And then I said ‘What a great idea. Maybe we’ll have to do that.’ That could happen.” Recalling Cold War fever dreams, military top brass like Vice Admiral Charles A. Richard and Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein have recently predicted that space will become an emerging battlefield. Coincidentally, the reemerging threat of space war came around the time the Air Force also asked for more money. Trump appears to have been bought into this dubious threat and, as he often does, is taking credit for the idea. To date, no wars have been fought in space.

Casey Newton,"Earlier this month, Facebook undertook an effort to recast the debate around the regulation of big tech companies on its own terms. Mark Zuckerberg wrote an op-ed; Sheryl Sandberg published a blog post; and their deputies gave interviews to outlets read closely by policymakers. The overall effect was of a company that has spent the past two years on the defensive organizing around a core set of principles to advocate for: principles that will allow the company to continue operating basically as is. This week, we saw the second plank of Facebook’s strategy: self-regulation from its product teams. In a meeting with reporters in Menlo Park, myself included, the company announced a series of product updates organized around what the company calls “integrity.” The announcements touched most of Facebook’s biggest products: the News Feed, groups, stories, Messenger, and Instagram. (WhatsApp was a notable exception.) Collectively, the moves seek to strike a better balance between freedom of speech and the harms that come with it. And also, of course, to signal to lawmakers that the company is capable of regulating itself effectively. Facebook says its strategy for problematic content has three parts: removing it, reducing it, and informing people about the actions that it’s taking. Its most interesting announcements on Wednesday were around reducing: moves that limit the viral promotion of some of the worst stuff on the platform. ”Click gap,” for example, is a new signal that attempts to identify sites that are popular on Facebook but not the rest of the web — a sign that they may be gaming the system somehow. Sites with a click gap will be ranked much lower in the News Feed. As Emily Dreyfuss and Issie Lapowsky describe it in Wired : Click-Gap could be bad news for fringe sites that optimize their content to go viral on Facebook. Some of the most popular stories on Facebook come not from mainstream sites that also get lots of traffic from search or directly, but rather from small domains specifically designed to appeal to Facebook’s algorithms. Experts like Jonathan Albright, director of the Digital Forensics Initiative at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, have mapped out how social networks, including Facebook and YouTube, acted as amplification services for websites that would otherwise receive little attention online, allowing them to spread propaganda during the 2016 election. Another move aimed at reducing harm on Facebook involves cracking down on groups that become hubs for misinformation. As Jake Kastrenakes writes in The Verge : Groups that “repeatedly share misinformation” will now be distributed to fewer people in the News Feed. That’s an important change, as it was frequently group pages that were used to distribute propaganda and misinformation around the 2016 US elections. Facebook will also soon give moderators a better view of the bad posts in their groups. “In the coming weeks,” it said, it will introduce a feature called Group Quality which collects all of the flagged and removed posts in a group in one place for moderators to look at. It will also have a section for false news, Facebook said, and the company plans to take into account moderator actions on these posts when determining whether to remove a group. I like these moves: they take away “freedom of reach” from anti-vaccine zealots and other folks looking to cultivate troll armies by hijacking Facebook’s viral machinery. There are a lot of other common-sense changes in yesterday’s fine print: allowing moderators to turn posting permissions on and off for individual group members, for example; and bringing Facebook verified badges to Messenger, which should cut down on the number of fake Mark Zuckerbergs scamming poor rubes out of their money. Still, I can’t shake the feeling that all these moves are a bit... incremental. They’re fine, so far as they go. But how will we know that they’re working? What does “working” even mean in this context? As Facebook has worked to right its ship since 2016, it has frequently fallen back on the line that while it’s “making progress,” it “still has a long way to go.” You can accept these statements as being true and still wonder what they mean in practice. When it comes to reducing the growth of anti-vaccine groups, for example, or groups that harass the survivors of the Sandy Hook shooting, how much more “progress” is needed? How far along are we? What is the goal line we’re expecting Facebook and the other tech platforms to move past? Elsewhere, Mark Bergen and Lucas Shaw report that YouTube is wrangling with a similar set of questions. Would the company’s own problems with promoting harmful videos diminish if it focused on a different set of metrics? YouTube is actively exploring the idea : The Google division introduced two new internal metrics in the past two years for gauging how well videos are performing, according to people familiar with the company’s plans. One tracks the total time people spend on YouTube, including comments they post and read (not just the clips they watch). The other is a measurement called “quality watch time,” a squishier statistic with a noble goal: To spot content that achieves something more constructive than just keeping users glued to their phones. The changes are supposed to reward videos that are more palatable to advertisers and the broader public, and help YouTube ward off criticism that its service is addictive and socially corrosive. But two years on, it’s unclear that new metrics have been of much help in that regard. When platforms reach planetary scale, individual changes like these have a limited effect. And as long as Facebook and YouTube struggle to articulate the destination they’re aiming for, there’s continuing reason to doubt that they’ll get there.

The probe will initially focus on Apple’s App Store, where regulators have received the most detailed complaints, and Dutch apps for news media, but is also calling on app providers to flag if they have any problems with Google ’s Play Store. The antitrust probe adds to a growing backlash against the tolls Apple and Google charge to developers using their app stores. The EU’s powerful antitrust arm is weighing Spotify’s complaint targeting Apple. This builds on concerns that technology platforms control the online ecosystem and may rig the game to their own advantage. Amazon.com Inc. ’s potential use of data on rival sellers is also being probed by the EU to check if it copies products. Archive.org hit with hundreds of false terrorist content notices from EU A popular internet archive is reporting that the European Union has been overzealous in its recent anti-terrorism enforcement. It’s this sort of thing that causes free-speech advocates to worry when regulations against “harmful content” are enacted: In a blog post yesterday, the organization explained that it received more than 550 takedown notices from the European Union in the past week “falsely identifying hundreds of URLs on archive.org as ‘terrorist propaganda’.” A Day After Facebook Banned Canadian White Nationalists, Some Found Their Way Back Here’s a story that shows how platforms are still struggling to prevent ban evasion: A day after Facebook banned six Canadian individuals and groups for spreading hate, two made their way back onto the platform with new pages, while 11 pages with similar names and content remained online despite the ban. Faith Goldy, the Canadian Nationalist Front, Wolves of Odin, and Canadian Infidels were all banned Monday, but more than 24 hours later BuzzFeed News and the Toronto Star found 12 pages, groups, and Instagram accounts using similar names and posting similar content that had been on the banned accounts. After asking Facebook for comment, they were all taken down. Jeff Bezos to meet with federal prosecutors on extortion and hacking claims Interesting from Erica Orden and Shimon Prokupecz: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is scheduled to meet with federal prosecutors in New York as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter. The meeting signals that the US attorney’s office is escalating its inquiry connected to Bezos’s suggestion that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia was behind a National Enquirer story that exposed his extramarital affair and his claim that the tabloid attempted to extort him. More than 3,500 Amazon Employees Urge Bold Action on Climate Change Speaking of Bezos, he’s facing his largest internal pressure front yet on climate change, Karen Weise reports: This week, more than 4,200 Amazon employees called on the company to rethink how it addresses and contributes to a warming planet. The action is the largest employee-driven movement on climate change to take place in the influential tech industry. The workers say the company needs to make firm commitments to reduce its carbon footprint across its vast operations, not make piecemeal or vague announcements. And they say that Amazon should stop offering custom cloud-computing services that help the oil and gas industry find and extract more fossil fuels. Why does Twitter link The New York Times to the phrase ‘Enemy of the People’? Today in Twitter whoopsies: “This is a bug in our search typeahead system limited to desktop that we are working to fix,” a spokesperson said. “The issue is that for some search queries, the word ‘People’ is linked to ‘@NYTimes.’” So while we still don’t really know why the search system is working this way, we do know that it’s supposed to be working differently. Elsewhere P&G Is Putting Ad Platforms Like Facebook and Google on Notice Procter & Gamble, one of the biggest advertisers on Google and Facebook, is threatening to drop its ads again if the companies don’t stop showing their ads next to drugs and whatnot. Oh but also … the chief brand officer would like them to develop better tracking solutions! Which one do you think he cares about more? Pritchard also brought up a key point of friction in the industry. He wants the ad platforms to use a standardized way of identifying individual consumers, so that advertisers can track people as they move across the internet and make sure they’re not repeatedly hitting a consumer with the same ad. But as privacy becomes a bigger concern for people and governments, Facebook, Google and others have used it as a reason to make it even more difficult to do that kind of tracking. The added privacy makes it harder for advertisers to send pinpointed messages to people, increasing their costs and annoying consumers who get hit with the same ad over and over again. Is Anyone Listening to You on Alexa? A Global Team Reviews Audio Matt Day, Giles Turner, and Natalia Drozdiak examine the use of human review teams to help improve Alexa’s speech-recognition abilities. It kicked up a firestorm on Twitter over privacy concerns: Sometimes they hear recordings they find upsetting, or possibly criminal. Two of the workers said they picked up what they believe was a sexual assault. When something like that happens, they may share the experience in the internal chat room as a way of relieving stress. Amazon says it has procedures in place for workers to follow when they hear something distressing, but two Romania-based employees said that, after requesting guidance for such cases, they were told it wasn’t Amazon’s job to interfere. The next generation of photo booths have their sights set on you Natt Garun visits a photo booth convention to examine how the Instagram and the larger internet has changed them: If ever there was an analogy for technology in 2019, the photo booth may be the mascot. What was once an innocuous machine designed to help you socialize and capture moments with friends has now been reappropriated to gather data for profit. In pursuit of shareability, machines are incentivized to create viral-worthy, multimedia content that, in turn, receive and funnel data straight to advertisers. Some photo booths, like Baltimore-based Pixilated, can even follow the same email address to track the specific events a customer attends. Texting Is Out. Spontaneous FaceTime Is In. James Wellemeyer says that for his generation, phone calls are out and FaceTime is in: For groups of college students and high schoolers, texting is out. Their go-to method of communication is FaceTime. “If you want to say something to someone, you don’t call them on the phone anymore,” says Kyle Baker, a 21-year-old junior at George Washington University. “You’ve gotta see their face.” Baker says he FaceTimes his friends “all the time,” and doing so is “totally normal.” I can back him up. I’m 19, and for my friends and me, random FaceTimes are a way of life. I FaceTime my friends without warning to ask them for help on homework or just to see when they’re free to meet up. It’s easier (and far more fun) than texting, and we’ve been doing it for more than two years now. FaceTime was released in February 2011, when I was 11. My peers and I literally grew up with it. Launches Introducing LinkedIn Reactions: More Ways to Express Yourself Nothing makes me happier than LinkedIn attempting to explain human emotions as part of a product launch: You can use Celebrate to praise an accomplishment or milestone like landing a new job or speaking at an event, or Love to express deep resonance and support, like a conversation about work life balance or the impact of mentorship. Twitter shakes up its experimental twttr app with new swipe gestures for engaging with tweets Twitter’s prototype app has a nifty new feature where you can swipe on a reply to like it. It’s a small thing, but definitely my favorite aspect of the new conversational design so far. The Privacy Project The New York Times has a new hub of pieces from its Opinion section looking at evolving attitudes toward privacy and how the rest of us are going to get along in the surveillance economy. Here’s a fine call to arms from my pal Kara Swisher. Takes Bob Iger, Disney CEO, slams ‘vile’ public discourse: ‘Hitler would have loved social media’ Disney’s chairman and CEO, who once considered buying Twitter, had some choice works for social networks when he accepted a humanitarian award: “Hitler would have loved social media,” he said, according to Variety. “It’s the most powerful marketing tool an extremist could ever hope for because by design social media reflects a narrow world view filtering out anything that challenges our beliefs while constantly validating our convictions and amplifying our deepest fears. “It creates a false sense that everyone shares the same opinion,” he continued. “Social media allows evil to prey on troubled minds and lost souls and we all know that social news feeds can contain more fiction than fact, propagating a vile ideology that has no place in a civil society that values human life.” Why Won’t Twitter Help Us Delete Our Tweets? John Herrman makes the case — persuasively — that Twitter ought to let us delete our tweets in bulk. For one user, it may be akin to updating a Facebook profile or brushing up a LinkedIn page; for another, it takes into account the demands of a new job; for another, deletion may be necessary to travel safely. Twitter has stubbornly refused to address widespread harassment on its platform, and tweet deletion offers a way to mitigate it in some forms. (That is probably the most-demanded feature, if you can call it that — that users be able to use the service without being confronted with targeted abuse.) The Twitter Archive Eraser app is, like Twitter, most popular in the United States, but according to its creators has also gained traction in Saudi Arabia, where Twitter, once seen as a tool of liberation, has been embraced by the government as a tool for surveillance and targeted repression. And finally... The New KFC Colonel Is a Computer-Generated Instagram Influencer Here’s something that feels totally unnecessary and inevitable at the same time: instead of tapping a famous actor to fill out the white suit, KFC is using a computer-generated bro that the company is calling “Virtual Influencer Colonel.” As his name implies, this dude loves living the good life and posing for photos on Instagram with his girlfriend, who is also a computer-generated model. Of course he’s got his own hashtag — #secretrecipeforsuccess — and those words are also tattooed across his chiseled abs. Goodbye.

Rhett Allain,"I like to spend time outside when possible. On a recent adventure I took a couple of the kids to check out some trails near my mother's house. This particular place was pretty nice. It had a lake with some cliffs you could walk along. Note: Do not jump off the cliffs into the water—there is a $500 fine for that (at least that's what the sign said). As we were standing near the edge of one of these cliffs, my daughter said that it wouldn't be too bad to jump off—it's not that high. I was pretty sure it was higher than she thought it is. But I don't have to just guess; we can measure the height with just a rock, my phone, and physics. Here's what you do. Take your phone and get ready to record some video. Now drop the rock from rest so that it falls into the water. If you have to toss the rock, that's fine, as long as you only throw it horizontally. Don't throw it up or down—this will give an inaccurate measurement for the height. The only thing you need from the video is the time it takes the rock to fall and hit the water. From this time, we can calculate the height. For my cliff, I got a free fall time of 1.3 seconds (I got this using Tracker Video Analysis —but there are lots of other programs to get the time). After you let go of the rock, there is essentially only one force acting on it—the gravitational force. This is a force that depends on the mass of the rock and the gravitational field (with a value on the surface of the Earth of 9.8 Newton/kilogram). We usually use the symbol g to represent this value. Since there is only one force on the rock, the rock will continue to speed up (accelerate)—that's what constant forces do to an object. The acceleration of an object depends on both the force AND the mass. Since both the force and the acceleration depend on mass, in this case it cancels and you get an acceleration of g m/s 2 in the vertical direction. That's why different mass rocks would hit the water at the same time (assuming the air resistance is negligible). Now we know the acceleration of the falling rock. The acceleration describes the rate that the velocity changes. In this case, the starting velocity is zero m/s and the final velocity is unknown. This means that I can use the acceleration to find an expression for the final velocity (even though I don't really care about this). Oh, I am going to call the downward direction the positive direction just for fun and because coordinate systems aren't real. If it makes you happy, you could put in the value for your rock time and g —but you don't have to right now. Instead, I am going to use the definition of the average velocity (in one dimension). Actually, there are two definitions of the average velocity. There is the rate of change of position and there is the actual average. You could stop here if you already calculated the final rock velocity—but I didn't do that. Instead, I can put my expression for this velocity into the this equation for the height and I get. Boom. This is my answer. I will put my value of 1.3 seconds for the time and 9.8 for g and I get a cliff height of 8.28 meters (or 27.2 feet). That's pretty high—I'm sure it's higher than my daughter would have guessed. But wait! Why didn't I just make this whole thing shorter and use the kinematic equations to find the height? Well, that's what I did. However, I didn't just use the final equation I also showed you where that equation comes from. See—accidental physics. Note: If you take a tiny rock and drop it, this might not work. The mass to surface area ratio for super tiny rocks means that the air resistance will be a significant force and the rock won't fall with a constant acceleration. Instead, take a good sized rock to drop. Oh, make sure no one is below you—getting hit by a rock is bad.","You can measure the height of a drop with just a rock, a phone, and the gravitational force.",2018-02-15T15:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Don't Cliff Jump Like a Dummy—Use Physics,https://www.wired.com/story/dont-cliff-jump-like-a-dummyuse-physics/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a84e80c263579570b6bfbef/191:100/pass/cliff-700678060.jpg,wired,Wired,force,1
Adam Rogers,"Three Tenets of Nerd: 1. A nerd must not harm another nerd, or through inaction allow a nerd to come to harm. 2. Nerds must cooperate with other nerds, except where such cooperation would violate the previous tenet. 3. Nerds must protect the existence of nerddom, except where such protection violates the first two tenets. So, I was at Comic-Con International in San Diego in 2008, the year of Twilight and True Blood. I’d never heard of either then—a blind spot, I admit—but that year something changed. Women have always attended SDCC, of course, but this year the lines switchbacking outside Hall H, the high altar of the annual nerd pilgrimage, were majority female for the first time I'd ever seen. The difference at the con was palpable, and the young men who at the time were the visible bulk of the con were audibly grumbling. Then Kevin Smith took the lectern in Hall H, after the Twilight fest, and spoke truth to powerlessness. What is the matter with you nerds? he said (I’m paraphrasing here). Where else are you going to meet a bunch of girls who also like vampires? You like vampires! Go talk to them! This wasn't about dating. Well, OK, it was a little about dating, but Smith also knew that the nerd world was broader than SDCC's stereotypical attendees would have you believe. There have always been every-type-of-human nerds, and in hopes of defusing their territoriality, Smith was telling the white boys it was time to acknowledge that. I thought it was going to work. I thought I was seeing the beginning of a profusion of nerddom—of both the canon and the people who could love it together, across spectra of gender and ethnicity. I thought: We are not alone. We are legion—united by honest love into an economic bloc that gets as much Wars, Trek, Who, Avengers, Halo, vampires, Ponies, or whatever else as we could ever have possibly hoped. Today, when I look at the cast of the various Star Wars movies, at the fact that the new Doctor Who is a woman, at the every-kind-of-rainbow crew on the new Star Trek show, I think, yup, there it is. We did it. But then, in the latest example of how wrong I am, Kelly Marie Tran got hounded off Instagram. Tran is the actress who plays Rose in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. She’s a mechanic who, with John Boyega’s Finn, embarks on a B-plot side adventure to a casino planet that teaches Finn that he’s not just along for the Resistance ride, but is in fact a real Rebel—just like Rose. (We also get to see some of the class disparities in the Star Wars universe that fuel two-bit fascists like General Hux.) A lot of people did not like that B-plot. A lot of people did not like the character of Rose. A lot of people did not like The Last Jedi. All of which is fine. People disagree about things! Unfortunately people—mostly men, though not only —also sling misogynistic, racist slop on the internet. Tran apparently got so much of it on her Instagram feed that she quit. (Daisy Ridley, who plays Rey, quit last year for the same reason.) Now neither of them gets to have that presence, and their fans don’t get to interact with them. When Tran left, Last Jedi director Rian Johnson—himself a target of quite a lot of online rage—tried to push back against the harassment and distinguish it from critiques of the movie, to little avail. Every longstanding universe in which I’m invested has had its ups and downs. I’m an avid Doctor Who fan. The Matt Smith era? Maybe you loved it; wasn't my favorite. I’m an avid Star Trek fan. Enterprise ? Well, I’m on to Discovery. Want to talk about why? Love to. That's part of what's great about being a nerd. Somehow, though, the reasonable and just expansion of these universes to include the kinds of people who never used get past the turbolift doors has made a vocal slice of fandom lose its mind. You can find examples from videogames to comic books to every other medium imaginable. In their minds, critiques of monochrome casting become criticism of people who liked those prior versions—critiques of them —landing at the exact moment they lose perceived centrality in a story they thought they owned. How does the love at the heart of fandom curdle into something so caustic? These anti-fans see, in new casts and storylines, the agendas of blinkered Social Justice Warriors more interested in diversity quotas and Signaling Virtue than making good movies. The new versions come to seem like aggressive critiques of the older work and by extension an existential attack on people who love it. In their minds, critiques of monochrome casting become criticism of people who liked those prior versions—critiques of them —landing at the exact moment they lose perceived centrality in a story they thought they owned. Those critiques are hard to untangle. If you think that Rey’s facility with a lightsaber and Jedi mind tricks happened too fast, does that make her a poorly developed character, or a Mary Sue ? Or does it make you sexist, if, after all, you didn’t complain about how fast Luke Skywalker spun up his powers, too One way to answer that question is this: if your opinion makes you say body-shaming things to Kelly Marie Tran on the internet, it's the bad thing. Johnson’s Last Jedi was explicitly about not being beholden to the rules of the past. It’s possible to enjoy new things while continuing to love flawed old things, not just despite those flaws but because of them. Acknowledging weaknesses and re-critiquing older work helps sustain it as art. That’s as true of a Da Vinci sketch as it is of Return of the Jedi. Even if New Star Wars is somehow corrupted by politics—which I don’t think it is—Old Star Wars still exists. Nobody’s lovingly plastic-sleeved laserdiscs of the pre-special edition trilogy melted when The Last Jedi came out. When Donald Glover said that Lando Calrissian’s pansexuality included droids, nobody’s Thrawn books spontaneously erupted in flames. Everyone has a right to opinions about movies. Everyone has a right, I guess, to throw those opinions in the face of the people who make those movies, though it does seem at minimum impolite. Everyone has the right to ask transnational entertainment companies to make the movies they want, and if those companies don’t respond, to stop giving the companies money. But harassment, threats, jokes about someone’s race or gender? A Jedi would fight someone who did that stuff. The Force binds us all together. Hatred and anger are the ways of the Dark Side; they may bring power, but at a cost. It harms individuals, debases the people who do it, and it breaks the Fellowship. In the end, the cost of that power will be powerlessness.",The Force is weak with the trolls who harassed 'The Last Jedi' actress Kelly Marie Tran on Instagram.,2018-06-06T19:18:09Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Star Wars and the Battle of the Ever-More Toxic Fan Culture,https://www.wired.com/story/star-wars-toxic-fandom/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b171bd0f2275d65761e4882/191:100/pass/KellyMarieTran-final.jpg,wired,Wired,force,1
AYANA MATHIS,"In April 2017, she executed the first of these compositions, named for one of the albums tracks, Scales, at the Menil Collection. In this intimate performance of selected songs from the album, she choreographed minimalist dance movements and dispensed with a stage, so that she and her two backup singers (all barefoot), along with a five-piece band, were hardly separated from the audience. Others followed: Seventy States, named after one of her own poems, included interactive digital pieces for the Tate Modern inspired by the assemblage artist Betye Saar and her role in the Black Arts Movement; in it, Solange projected clips of herself and a few other women lying in the ocean and trekking up a mountain, some scenes of which were originally concepts for her music videos. An Ode To was performed in May 2017 at the Guggenheim Museum. The show opened with Solange and her few dozen dancers marching down the museums grand, Frank Lloyd Wright-designed spiraling ramps to the rotunda. The young black New York-based fashion designer Telfar Clemens dressed the troupe in utilitarian white and camel-colored two-pieces: She had her hand in all aspects of the performance from the music, choreography and styling to the documentation and I was blown away that all of the parts came together in about two or three days, he says. It was a historical moment. Solanges sculptures, white geometric totems, completed the scene. Or perhaps its more accurate to say that the audience of 450 was the crowning element: Many of them were people of color, who were requested by invitation to dress in white apparel. With these events and others like them, Solange emerged as a legitimate multimedia artist, unveiling a kind of performer the public had not yet seen. She released herself, and her talents, from the constraints of category. She expanded the context in which her music is usually heard to include more traditional concert settings as well as the halls of high art. In doing so, she radically reframed herself, her music and representations of African-American womanhood. She understands black music and black experience as art in its own right, venue notwithstanding. Her mission to bring largely black audiences to typically white spaces is, in itself, transformative. The Guggenheim did not host its first solo exhibition by an African-American woman until Carrie Mae Weemss retrospective in 2014, just three years before Solanges An Ode To. It would be an understatement to say that the rarefied temples of Western art have not typically been welcoming to black womens artistry. Her efforts, Solange hopes, will set precedent for other black performers like her. In a photograph taken at the Menil show in Houston, a little black girl looks on, awe-struck. She is too young to grasp all the nuance of what she sees, but she knows it is monumental, and she knows the people doing it look like her. At a series of small performances at Vancouvers Rennie Museum last year, the venue covered the cost for members of Black Lives Matter. The front lines, Solange says, are open to my people. AT A PICNIC table on the scraggly grass beyond the bungalow, Solanges all-male band gathers. Shes known some of these musicians since she was a kid; she went to middle school with one of her drummers. The men wait patiently, but I can feel their anticipation. The new album calls. The making of it has taken Solange to New Orleans (where she often lives), Jamaica, Californias Topanga Canyon and back to a kind of Houston of the mind. There is a lot of jazz at the core, she emailed me a few days after our meeting. But with electronic and hip-hop drum and bass because I want it to bang and make your trunk rattle. The sound and feel of the album are set in her mind, but this project, so close to being finished, is still very much in progress and will be until the very end. I like to be able to tell the story in 13 different ways, then I like to edit, she says of her process. Many of the songs on A Seat at the Table were 15 minutes long until the final stages of production, when, with surgical decisiveness, Solange cut them down to three or four. Shell do the same as she completes this yet unnamed album. The record will be warm, she says, fluid and more sensual than her last one. But, seasoned as she is, shes still nervous. I have this fear living in my body about releasing work, she says. I dont know any artist that doesnt feel that before they hit the send button. These months leading to the albums release have been a period of reflection and preparation for the work that is to come. It is not that she has suddenly become a hybrid artist, it is that she has discovered how to execute the hybridity she has always imagined. In assembling a 2017 outdoor performance piece of Scales at Donald Judds sprawling Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Tex., she encountered spatial difficulties that she says gave her new perspective: I realize how much wider, figuratively and literally, my work could be if I took myself away as subject. She is still evolving, finding herself at that point between inspiring others with her activism and art peers like Janelle Monáe, Questlove and Zoë Kravitz have attended her museum performances, and it was no less than Beyoncé who sang in 2013, My sister told me I should speak my mind and honing her own craft. Recently, Solange has embarked upon a kind of self-guided apprenticeship. She has been watching the director Busby Berkeleys elaborate movie musical-production numbers from the 1930s to understand the complexities of large-scale, high-drama choreography. She studied movement with the modern dancer and choreographer Diane Madden. I want to continue to learn about all of the mechanisms of theater, she says. I want to spend a month going to Vegas shows, just being backstage and learning the logistics. Perhaps that is a sign of her performances to come. Her instructors are wide-ranging and eclectic: Joni Mitchell, in whom Solange found lessons in balancing a career as a musician with the demands of visual creation (Mitchells first, never abandoned love was painting); Missy Elliott, whose music videos are genre-defying and imagistically striking. Solange is drawing sonic inspiration from the 90s singer Aaliyah, the experimental 20th-century musician and composer Sun Ra, the 60s psychedelic soul band Rotary Connection and Stevie Wonders 1979 album Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants. Now, though, its time for the artist to return to the work at hand. As we rise and she leads me out to the yard where well say our goodbyes, I feel the tide of her focus turn toward the band. Making this record, she tells me after our parting hug, feels every bit like those long-ago Sundays in church watching the grown folk taken over by the spirit, carried off into something greater than themselves. With this alchemic mix of multivalent aesthetic expression grounded in her blackness and, yes, her pop appeal Solange has finally found her Holy Ghost. And now theres no use hiding from it.

Devin Coldewey,"The field of technology and the business practices within it tend to advance faster than regulators can keep up. But the FTC is making a concerted effort with a new 17-lawyer tech task force dedicated to ensuring “free and fair competition” and watching for anticompetitive conduct among technology companies.
This isn’t necessarily a precursor to some big action like breaking up a big company or imposing rules or anything like that. It seems to be more a recognition that the FTC needs to be ready to ascertain quickly and move decisively in tech matters, and a crack team of tech-savvy staff attorneys is the way to do it.
The Technology Task Force will live under the competition bureau within the FTC, the director of which, Bruce Hoffman, commented as follows in the agency’s announcement:
Technology markets, which are rapidly evolving and touch so many other sectors of the economy, raise distinct challenges for antitrust enforcement. By centralizing our expertise and attention, the new task force will be able to focus on these markets exclusively ensuring they are operating pursuant to the antitrust laws, and taking action where they are not.
That it is under this bureau and not the bureau of consumer protection gives a good indicator of its purpose. This won’t be a way for the FTC to, for instance, more closely scrutinize Google or Facebook’s shady user data practices. That said the lawyers are stated to have expertise in “advertising, social networking, mobile operating systems and apps, and platform businesses,” which I doubt they mention for no reason.
Instead it is likely to be more focused on investigating and reporting on potential anticompetitive practices that are the potential result of M&amp;A deals or quasi-monopolies like Amazon and Facebook. The fascinating Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox paper from a while back noted all kinds of ways that company slips through loopholes while performing actions that look, walk, and talk like monopolistic ones.
But just what exactly constitutes such practices legally speaking is a matter of considerable debate. No doubt the lawyers and their tech fellow, with whom they will consult, will spend a great deal of time sifting through old cases and precedents and seeing what does and doesn’t apply. The team will be performing its own investigations of ongoing and completed mergers, and will also supply investigative services to other branches of the agency.
Essentially it’s an indication that the FTC will be taking tech antitrust more seriously going forward, and dedicating more and better organized resources to the task of monitoring the sector. That’s probably not the kind of thing big tech companies like to hear.

But since Oct. 26, they have been marching to new White House orders: go back and look at different ways to reorganize the militarys space operations. This is Ground Control to Mr. Trump Youve really made the grade And Fox &amp; Friends wants to know whose shirts you wear Now its time to ask for funding if you dare One of the four new options is an old one, defense officials said: a space corps that would be part of the Air Force, the way the Marine Corps is part of the Department of the Navy. The proposed structure is similar to a bipartisan proposal that passed in the House but failed in the Senate last year. This is Mr. Trump to Ground Control Im stepping through the door And Im flailing in a most peculiar way And the stars look very Democrat today Why the second thoughts? The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, suggested that some in the Trump administration fear that the proposed independent Space Force might not make it through Congress. For here Am I sitting in the White House Far above the world House of Reps is blue And theres nothing I can do A former senior defense official said Pentagon officials would be more comfortable with a space corps within the Air Force, but feel Trumps comments that he wants a separate but equal space force have given them little wiggle room. Though Im past one hundred thousand miles Im feeling very still And I think my Space Force knows which way to go Tell my Wall I love it very much It knows The four options, according to one of the officials, include: 1) an Air Force-owned space corps that includes only Air Force assets, 2) an Air Force-owned space corps that also takes space-related troops and assets from the Army and Navy, 3) an independent service that takes from the Air Force, Army, and Navy, and 4) an independent service that takes from the three services plus parts of the intelligence community.

Chaim Gartenberg,"A US District Court judge in California has ruled in favor of Facebook, denying a joint federal and state task force that tried to force the social networking company to wiretap Messenger voice calls by holding the company in contempt of court, according to a report from Reuters. The case first came up last month, when the Department of Justice was reportedly looking to hold Facebook in contempt of court for refusing to comply with a wiretapping request for an ongoing investigation into the MS-13 gang. Because Messenger calls are conducted over a cellular data connection or Wi-Fi, they are not subject to the same wiretap laws as standard phone calls, which law enforcement can gain access to with a proper warrant. Facebook won’t have to give the government access to Messenger calls That hasn’t stopped law enforcement from trying to force technology companies to aid with such requests, sometimes by breaking or bypassing their own encryption. In that sense, the case bears some similarity to the standoff between Apple and the FBI over unlocking an iPhone from a suspect in the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. Like Apple, Reuters reports that Facebook refused to alter or adjust its software to give the government a backdoor into users’ private conversations, a decision that judge’s ruling seems to have upheld despite some key differences between Apple’s and Facebook’s handling of user data and use of encryption. As with the initial report of the DOJ’s request that Facebook break Messenger’s encryption for government wiretapping, the case is still under seal, so there’s still no public documents or records as to the judge’s reasoning for ruling in Facebook’s favor. The ruling protecting Facebook from weakening or removing its encryption on Messenger will likely have ramifications going forward as a precedent for protecting users’ privacy in future cases, too — something that will surely come up more frequently in the future as tech companies continue to clash with law enforcement over privacy and encryption.","A US District Court judge in California has reportedly ruled in favor of Facebook, denying a joint federal and state task force that tried to force the social networking company to wiretap Messenger voice calls by holding the company in contempt of court.",2018-09-28T21:34:17Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Facebook reportedly avoids US government wiretap of Messenger voice calls,https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17915902/facebook-messenger-protected-us-government-wiretap-requests,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7ABktzaCa8-aBHgygBVDU62ZMQ=/0x226:2040x1294/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8699585/akrales_170602_1743_0012.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,force,1
Aimée Lutkin,"Thanksgiving is over, so you can forget about feeling gratitude for lifes bounty for another year. Or you can keep working that muscle; with practice, you can be happier and more grateful for your life. Sometimes its hard to think about whats good in your life. Weirdly, this even happens to people who you would say have a demonstrably better life than your ownmore money, more friends, more status. Thats because gratitude isnt necessarily a marker of actual life blessingsits more like a mutant ability to experience positive feelings more intensely than normal, according to an op-ed by Arthur C. Brooks for the New York Times. A 2014 article in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience identified a variation in a gene (CD38) associated with gratitude. Some people simply have a heightened genetic tendency to experience, in the researchers words, global relationship satisfaction, perceived partner responsiveness and positive emotions (particularly love). If youre not genetically predisposed to happiness, dont despair (any more than usual). There are things you can do that will build up whatever ability you already have. Go Through The Motions Telling someone to pretend theyre happy is fraught advice, especially since a lot of people with mental health issues may be missing the help they need if they go along with it. If youre depressed, you should be honest about that and speak with a doctor. But there is another shade of meaning to the idea that you should fake it til you make it. Sometimes acting as though youre happy and grateful is like jumpstarting an engine. Instead of getting out of bed and going to sit on the couch and watch the news, you could stand at the window and hum a song or stretch or laugh out loud. Small behaviors accrue and our body takes note of them. For example, Brooks references the famous 1993 experiment that indicated even the mechanical motion of smiling can sometimes make us feel happier. It stimulates brain activity that is associated with positive emotions. Expressing gratitude, even when youre not really feeling it, can do the same: According to research published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, gratitude stimulates the hypothalamus (a key part of the brain that regulates stress) and the ventral tegmental area (part of our reward circuitry that produces the sensation of pleasure). Until you start to feel it, pretend, and real gratitude may appear. Makes Lists Theres a reason a gratitude journal is a thing. Taking the time to list things youre grateful for every day makes a marked difference in how you feel about your life. Brooks references a study from 2003, in which a group of people were asked to keep a weekly list of things they were grateful for. Others were asked to keep weekly lists of thing that were annoying or neutral. At the end of the ten week study, the gratitude group enjoyed significantly greater life satisfaction than the group that had been keeping track of everything that sucks. Gratitude isnt just some corny mind fluff; it can make you happier, more resilient, and even help Read more Read Putting a pen to paper will force you to think about the things in your life you enjoy instead of the things you hate. Even if theyre small, your mind is spending time in a positive place instead of a negative one, which is setting you up for a better day. Express Thanks A journal or list is what Brooks calls internal gratitude, but thats just one piece of the puzzle. External gratitude is when we make a point of thanking others or saying what were thankful for out loud. Or via email: The psychologist Martin Seligman, father of the field known as positive psychology, gives some practical suggestions on how to do this. In his best seller Authentic Happiness, he recommends that readers systematically express gratitude in letters to loved ones and colleagues. A disciplined way to put this into practice is to make it as routine as morning coffee. Write two short emails each morning to friends, family or colleagues, thanking them for what they do. Imagine thanking someone you care about every day for what they do for the world. Itll not only give you an opportunity to dwell on something good, it will likely cheer them up as well. In fact, Brooks recommends attempting a thank you when confronted with anger. Apparently, people with low emotional security who tend to lash out when confronted will melt into a puddle as soon as they hear a nice thanks. That might include your own brain.","Thanksgiving is over, so you can forget about feeling gratitude for life’s bounty for another year.

Jonathan Shieber,"In a speech before the Department of Defense at the Pentagon today, Vice President Mike Pence outlined the broad contours of the new Space Force that the Trump Administration wants to create as the sixth branch of the U.S. military. Emphasizing the need to both further militarize and privatize space as a new war-fighting domain, Pence stressed that the new branch of the military is targeted for a 2020 implementation date. The administration is pushing for $8 billion in new space spending. “While other nations increasingly possess the capability to operate in space, not all of them share our commitment to freedom, private property and the rule of law,” said Pence. “As we continue to carry American leadership in space, so also will we carry America’s commitment to freedom into this new frontier.” Pence cited threats from North Korea, Russia, China and Iran to the safety of the U.S. space program. Newer threats include the Chinese government’s 2007 launch of a satellite-destroying missile and the development of hypersonic missiles that can evade U.S. missile defense capabilities. The Chinese government has set up a separate division within its own military to address space as a war-fighting domain, Pence said. “Our adversaries have transformed space into a war-fighting domain already.” “It is not enough to have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space,” Pence said quoting the president. “What was once peaceful and uncontested is now crowded and adversarial.” To advance its goals of creating the new Space Force, the Trump Administration had commissioned the Department of Defense to issue a report on the necessary steps to create the new military branch. The creation of a new branch of the military — the first since the Air Force was created in the wake of World War II in 1947 — could require a significant reorganization of the Pentagon. And some officials within the military and national security communities fiercely oppose the idea. The Air Force in particular is opposed to the idea, because it might lose key responsibilities. The proposal would also need Congressional approval. In a report that will be issued later today, the DOD outlined four steps. The first is the creation of a United States Space Command that will coordinate the nation’s space-fighting capabilities. Pence likened it to the special operations command established in the eighties that provided unified command and control capabilities for mobilizing terrestrial air, sea and land forces. “This new command structure for the physical domain of space, led by a four star flag officer will…. develop the space warfighting doctrine and tactics of the future.” As part of the space plan, the Department of Defense will also create a new space operations force that will be “an elite group of joint war fighters specializing in the war-fighting domains of space,” according to Pence. They’ll support the space combat and command and carry out space missions. Third, a new joint organization called the Space Development Agency will be created to develop new technologies for the space force. “While our adversaries have been busy weaponizing space, we have been bureaucratizing it,” Pence said. He pointed to the creation of the intercontinental ballistic missiles and the Navy’s nuclear fleet as examples of American military innovation and achievement from past initiatives. (It’s a good thing he didn’t bring up the Air Force’s “half-a-trillion dollar drone boondoggle” of a new fighter plane.) Finally, the process of creating the new organization will require oversight, which will include the creation of a new civilian position that will report to the secretary of defense, Pence said. That position will be called the assistant secretary of defense of space. “Just as we’ve done in ages past, the United States will meet the emerging threats on this new battlefield,” Pence said. “The time has come to establish the United States Space Force.”","In a speech before the Department of Defense at the Pentagon today, Vice President Mike Pence outlined the broad contours of the new Space Force that the Trump Administration wants to create as the sixth branch of the U.S. military.

Amy Crawford,"This story originally appeared on CityLab and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Gotham Greens’ boxed lettuces have been popping up on the shelves of high-end grocers in New York and the Upper Midwest since 2009, and with names like “Windy City Crunch,” “Queens Crisp,” and “Blooming Brooklyn Iceberg,” it’s clear the company is selling a story as much as it is selling salad. Grown in hydroponic greenhouses on the rooftops of buildings in New York and Chicago, the greens are shipped to nearby stores and restaurants within hours of being harvested. That means a fresher product, less spoilage, and lower transportation emissions than a similar rural operation might have—plus, for the customer, the warm feeling of participating in a local food web. “As a company, we want to connect urban residents to their food, with produce grown a few short miles from where you are,” said Viraj Puri, Gotham Greens’ co-founder and CEO. Gotham Greens’ appealing narrative and eight-figure annual revenues suggest a healthy future for urban agriculture. But while it makes intuitive sense that growing crops as close as possible to the people who will eat them is more environmentally friendly than shipping them across continents, evidence that urban agriculture is good for the environment has been harder to pin down. A widely cited 2008 study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that transportation from producer to store only accounts for 4 percent of food’s total greenhouse gas emissions, which calls into question the concern over “food miles.” Meanwhile, some forms of urban farming may be more energy-intensive than rural agriculture, especially indoor vertical farms that rely on artificial lighting and climate control. An operation like Gotham Greens can recycle water through its hydroponic system, but outdoor farms such as the ones sprouting on vacant lots in Detroit usually require irrigation, a potential problem when many municipal water systems are struggling to keep up with demand. And many urban farms struggle financially; in a 2016 survey of urban farmers in the US, only one in three said they made a living from the farm. Although cities and states have begun to loosen restrictions on urban agriculture, and even to encourage it with financial incentives, it has remained an open question whether growing food in cities is ultimately going to make them greener. Will the amount of food produced be worth the tradeoffs? A recent analysis of urban agriculture’s global potential, published in the journal Earth’s Future, has taken a big step toward an answer—and the news looks good for urban farming. “Not only could urban agriculture account for several percent of global food production, but there are added co-benefits beyond that, and beyond the social impacts,” said Matei Georgescu, a professor of geographical sciences and urban planning at Arizona State University and a co-author of the study, along with other researchers at Arizona State, Google, China’s Tsinghua University, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Hawaii. A MODIS Land Cover Type satellite image of the United States, similar to imagery analyzed by the researchers. Different colors indicate different land uses: red is urban; bright green is deciduous broadleaf forest. Using Google’s Earth Engine software, as well as population, meteorological, and other datasets, the researchers determined that, if fully implemented in cities around the world, urban agriculture could produce as much as 180 million metric tons of food a year—perhaps 10 percent of the global output of legumes, roots and tubers, and vegetable crops. Those numbers are big. Researchers hope they encourage other scientists, as well as urban planners and local leaders, to begin to take urban agriculture more seriously as a potential force for sustainability. The study also looks at “ecosystem services” associated with urban agriculture, including reduction of the urban heat-island effect, avoided stormwater runoff, nitrogen fixation, pest control, and energy savings. Taken together, these additional benefits make urban agriculture worth as much as $160 billion annually around the globe. The concept of ecosystem services has been around for decades, but it is growing in popularity as a way to account, in economic terms, for the benefits that humans gain from healthy ecosystems. Georgescu and his collaborators decided to investigate the potential ecosystem services that could be provided through widespread adoption of urban agriculture, something that had not been attempted before. The team began with satellite imagery, using pre-existing analyses to determine which pixels in the images were likely to represent vegetation and urban infrastructure. Looking at existing vegetation in cities (it can be difficult to determine, from satellite imagery, what’s a park and what’s a farm), as well as suitable roofs, vacant land, and potential locations for vertical farms, they created a system for analyzing the benefits of so-called “natural capital”—here, that means soil and plants—on a global and country-wide scale. Beyond the benefits we already enjoy from having street trees and parks in our cities, the researchers estimated that fully-realized urban agriculture could provide as much as 15 billion kilowatt hours of annual energy savings worldwide—equivalent to nearly half the power generated by solar panels in the US. It could also sequester up to 170,000 tons of nitrogen and prevent as much as 57 billion cubic meters of stormwater runoff, a major source of pollution in rivers and streams. “We had no notion of what we would find until we developed the algorithm and the models and made the calculation,” Georgescu said. “And that work had never been done before. This is a benchmark study, and our hope with this work is that others now know what sort of data to look for.” Robert Costanza, a professor of public policy at Australian National University, cofounded the International Society for Ecological Economics and researches sustainable urbanism and the economic relationship between humans and our environment. He called the study (in which he played no part) “a major advance.” “This is the first global estimate of the potential for urban agriculture,” Costanza wrote in an email. “Urban agriculture will never feed the world, and this paper confirms that, but the important point is that natural capital in cities can be vastly improved and this would produce a range of benefits, not just food.” “Urban agriculture will never feed the world … but the important point is that natural capital in cities can be vastly improved.” Costanza said he would like to see the researchers’ big data approach become standard in urban planning, as a way to determine the best balance between urban infrastructure and green space—whether it’s farms, forests, parks, or wetlands. That is the researchers’ hope as well, and they’ve released their code to allow other scientists and urban planners to run their own data, especially at the local level. “Somebody, maybe in Romania, say, could just plug their values in and that will produce local estimates,” Georgescu said. “If they have a grand vision of developing or expanding some city with X amount of available land where urban agriculture can be grown, they can now quantify these added co-benefits.” That could be very valuable, said Sabina Shaikh, director of the Program on the Global Environment at the University of Chicago, who researches the urban environment and the economics of environmental policy. “Ecosystem services is something that is very site-specific,” she said. “But this research may help people make comparisons a little bit better, particularly policymakers who want to think through, ‘What’s the benefit of a park vs. food production?’ or some combination of things. It doesn’t necessarily mean, because it has the additional benefit of food production, that a farm is going to be more highly valued than a park. But it gives policymakers another tool, another thing to consider.” Meanwhile, policy in the US and internationally is already changing to accommodate and encourage urban agriculture. California, for example, passed its Urban Agriculture Incentive Zones Act in 2014, allowing landowners who place urban plots into agricultural use to score valuable tax breaks. The idea has proven controversial—especially in housing-starved San Francisco. Beyond raising rents, critics have argued that urban agriculture, if it impedes development of housing, could reduce density, contributing to the sort of sprawl that compels people to drive their cars more. Put urban farms in the wrong place, and an effort to reduce food’s carbon footprint could have the opposite effect. On the other hand, businesses like Gotham Greens that aim to expand may still be hampered by zoning—Puri and his co-founders had to work with New York’s zoning authority to change regulations affecting greenhouses before they could open their first farm. As the company looks to add sites in other cities, the wide array of their zoning rules, utility access, and regulations will influence its decisions. “I think we could benefit from more cohesive policy,” Puri said, “but it’s also a very new industry. And then there are so many approaches to urban agriculture. How does a city approach something that is so broad and diverse at this stage?” While more data about the potential ecosystem services and tradeoffs would surely help create a more navigable regulatory landscape, Puri, like others in his industry, is also something of an evangelist, eager to put in a word for urban farming’s less quantifiable benefits. “I don’t believe that urban farming is ever going to replace more conventional farming,” he said. “I don’t think a city is going to be able to produce its entire food supply within city limits, but I think it can play a role in bringing people closer to their food, and in making our cities more diverse and interesting and green.”",A global analysis finds that urban agriculture could yield up to 10 percent of many food crops—good news for its future as a force for sustainability.,2018-02-20T12:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Big Data Suggests Big Potential for Urban Farming,https://www.wired.com/story/big-data-suggests-big-potential-for-urban-farming/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a8758e8915fc539b509aa1b/191:100/pass/urbanfarmhk-490580465.jpg,wired,Wired,force,1
Matt Simon,"The month-long launch window for NASA’s new Mars lander, InSight opens this weekend. InSight will be the first spacecraft to use a robotic arm to place its instruments on another planet’s soil—effectively unraveling the innards of the Red Planet. It’s also the first interplanetary mission to launch from the West Coast instead of Cape Canaveral, and it may not be the last. InSight isn’t a rover, like Curiosity or Opportunity, but a stationary lander. Its mission is to peer deep into Mars with two main instruments. One is a probe that’ll hammer 16 feet deep to take the planet’s temperature and determine how much heat it’s losing. (That heat comes from the violent formation of a planet, but also the decay of radioactive elements.) The other is a seismometer for sensing marsquakes. Together, the instruments, which the robot arm will pluck from the deck of the spacecraft, will ideally show what Mars is made of, lending insight (sorry) into not just how the Red Planet came to be, but the history of other rocky planets in our solar system. First, though, InSight has to get off Earth. Engineers stuck it atop an Atlas V-401 rocket, which stands nearly 200 feet tall and weighs in at 730,000 pounds, including the spacecraft. (By contrast, the world’s largest rocket, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, tallies a cool 3.1 million pounds. NBD.) It’ll launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base north of Los Angeles. Why snub Cape Canaveral in Florida, which is traditionally the launch site for interplanetary missions? Because the West Coast is no slouch, is why. For one, things are busy on the East Coast, thanks in part to satellite-happy commercial outfits like SpaceX. (Cape Canaveral is scrambling to accommodate all those launches, aiming to average a launch a week in the next five years.) Putting a satellite in orbit around our planet is one thing, but Mars spacecraft are extra complicated because they have to launch when the positions of Earth and the Red Planet are just right. “If it's a planetary mission, you end up with a very short window you have to launch in,” says Scott Messer, program manager for NASA launch services at United Launch Alliance, which operates the rocket. If a primo day opens up, InSight can’t have other peoples’ rockets clogging up the spaceport. You have to go, and go now. The next consideration, of course, is geography. Cape Canaveral is great for launches because NASA can fire east over the Atlantic Ocean instead of over land. “Because of that, you're able to take advantage of the rotation of the Earth a little bit more,” says Messer. Planetary physics gives the vehicle a nice little boost on its way into space. Also, you don’t want a malfunctioning rocket falling on a city. To get that same slingshot effect from Vandenberg on the West Coast, you’d need to fire over the continental US, which … not safe and not allowed. So instead InSight will head south over the waters off Mexico. (Here’s a great video showing the trajectory.) It’ll only head kinda east. But fear not: It will still most certainly have the power to escape Earth’s gravitational clutches. InSight is a relatively light spacecraft that was small enough to fit on a Delta II rocket, which carried the Spirit and Opportunity rovers. But when ULA procured the mission in 2013, the Delta II was no longer flying from the East Coast. “Because we didn't have that Delta II capability any longer from the East Coast, we went to our next size vehicle,” says Messer. That’d be the Atlas V-401, which comes with extra power. Thus InSight could launch from the West Coast. Really, though, it was the crowdedness of Cape Canaveral that moved the mission to California. Right now, Vandenberg launches mostly satellites, at a much less frantic pace than the Cape. (After InSight, Vandenberg is scheduled to send off six more rockets carrying satellites before the end of September. And by the way, regardless of when it launches in its month-long window, InSight will land on Mars on November 26.) But InSight is setting precedent here. “There may be additional opportunities going forward to have larger vehicles launch interplanetaries from the West Coast,” says Messer. Given the pace of the commercial space race, we’ll be seeing more and more launches around the world. Russia, for instance, has begun launching from a shiny new cosmodrome. In the US, the fact remains that Florida has the right geography both for old folks looking for nice weather and for rocket scientists looking to fire east, and it’s going to stay that way. That is, until rising seas eat Florida. But hey, maybe by that time we’ll all be living on Mars with InSight. More on InSight You have no idea what lengths NASA goes through to keep a spacecraft like InSight clean. Want more info on the science behind InSight? Here’s our guide. Just because InSight is headed to Mars, doesn’t mean we can forget about Curiosity, which is autonomously sampling rocks with a laser now.","This month, NASA will fire its first interplanetary mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base north of Los Angeles.

Some formats previously defaulted to Better Performance, which caches the write operations to the USB drive for better system performance, but these cached transfers have to be completed before the drive is removed to prevent losing data, hence the Safely Remove option. With this change, users will no longer have to select Safely Remove USB device before unplugging it from their PCat least by default.
While there are concerns that making Quick Removal the default policy will reduce performance for USB devices, this may actually be a good thing since it will prevent botched transfers when removing the drive too early.

Devin Coldewey,"New York City may soon gain a task force dedicated to monitoring the fairness of algorithms used by municipal agencies. Formed from experts in automated systems and representatives of groups affected by those systems, it would be responsible for closely examining algorithms in use by the city and making recommendations on how to improve accountability and avoid bias. The bill, which doesn’t have a fancy name, has been approved by the city council and is on the Mayor’s desk for signing. The New York division of the ACLU has argued in favor of it. Say, for instance, an “automated decision system” (as the law calls them) determines to a certain extent who’s eligible for bail. It may be that biases inherent to the training data that produced this system tend to result in one group being unjustly favored for bail hearings over another. The task force will be required to author a report that lays out procedures for dealing with situations like the above. Specifically, the report will make recommendations regarding the following: How can people know whether or not they or their circumstances are being assessed algorithmically, and how should they be informed as to that process? Does a given system disproportionately impact certain groups, such as the elderly, immigrants, the disabled, minorities, etc? If so, what should be done on behalf of an affected group? How does a given system function, both in terms of its technical details and in how the city applies it? How should these systems and their training data be documented and archived? The task force would need to be formed within three months of the bill’s signing, and importantly it must include “persons with expertise in the areas of fairness, accountability and transparency relating to automated decision systems and persons affiliated with charitable corporations that represent persons in the city affected by agency automated decision systems.” So this wouldn’t just be a bunch of machine learning experts and a couple lawyers. You need social workers and human rights advocates as well, something I’ve certainly argued for in the past. The report itself (which would be public) wouldn’t be due for 18 months, but this isn’t the kind of thing you want to rush. Assessing these systems is a data-intensive task and creating parallel municipal systems to make sure people don’t fall through the cracks is civically very important.

Graeme McMillan,"As the release date for Star Wars: The Last Jedi approaches at ludicrous speed, stories on the creation of the movie—and teases about what might happen in it, or even after it—are beginning to pile up on all sides of the information superhighway. Don't know what to listen to or who to believe? Dear friends, just trust in the Force and keep reading. Rey May Break the Force's Status Quo The Source: Daisy Ridley and her plot teases Probability of Accuracy: File under “interesting speculation” more than “guaranteed certainty,” for now. The Real Deal: Rumors have been circulating for a while that Rey is going to bring some kind of balance to the Force in The Last Jedi. That speculation got an extra boost last week when the actress playing her, Daisy Ridley, hinted on Good Morning America that Rey might break away from that whole Jedi-or-Sith thing altogether. ""I think the thing about this film is it's not so… The lines are less clear as to 'good and bad,'"" Ridley said, adding, ""Rey is trying to find out about herself and about the universe. And those questions don't entirely fall to the good, nor do they entirely fall to the bad. She's trying to do her own sort of personal growth."" The kind of personal growth that would have once led someone to become a Grey Jedi, perhaps? Little Hate Machine The Source: The man responsible for the aliens in a galaxy far, far away Probability of Accuracy: If you can’t trust BB-8’s dad, who can you trust? The Real Deal: While Rey is busy finding herself in the new movie, it turns out that BB-8 is going to be doing something similar, thanks to the debut of its opposite number: the First Order droid BB-9E. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Neal Scanlan, head of Lucasfilm’s Star Wars creature shop, talked about the design of the new villain, and how his team made something so cute look so evil. ""With BB-9E, we go back to literally the cold First Order sort of Empire version of what a BB unit might be,"" he said, calling 9E’s look ""much more cold, calculative, much more direct"" than the cuddly BB-8—while promising a showdown that echoes classic moments of Star Wars past. ""There’s a lovely moment between BB-8 and BB-9E, which tells that sort of parallel story of Vader and Luke,” Scanlan said. Wait. Is BB-9E the parent droid of BB-8?!? Is there going to be an emotional revelation? Going for Snoke The Source: Snoke’s alter ego, actor Andy Serkis Probability of Accuracy: Again, this is more of a tease than an accurate prediction. And yet… The Real Deal: And what of the main villain of the piece? Andy Serkis, who plays Supreme Leader Snoke, dropped a few hints about his character during a different interview with EW, suggesting that there’s a wounded man behind that malevolent, massive projection fans saw in The Force Awakens —and one who’s not too happy with his star pupil. ""His training of Kylo Ren is not yielding what he wants,"" Serkis said. ""Therefore his anger towards Kylo Ren is intensified because he can’t bear weakness in others. Part of the manipulation is goading him with Hux and playing them off against each other."" What kind of man would do that? Serkis had an answer for that, too. ""He’s terribly powerful, of course. But he is also a very vulnerable and wounded character. … He has suffered and he has suffered injury. The way that his malevolence comes out is in reaction to that. His hatred of the Resistance is fueled by what’s happened to him personally.” Huh. Could he have a legitimate complaint against the good guys? Daisy did say The Last Jedi was going to be more morally ambiguous… The Wampa Protection Agency Is Active The Source: The last Jedi himself Probability of Accuracy: As certain as a shot made in the Death Star trench. The Real Deal: It turns out that the moment everyone went, “Wait, what the hell is going on here?” In The Empire Strikes Back also left its star a little unhappy, as well, with Mark Hamill revealing on Twitter that, when it was being filmed, he didn’t know that Luke Skywalker was about to kill a Hoth Wampa. ""When filming scene I was assured my lightsaber swipe toward camera (creature not on set) would simply singe fur 2 scare him off,” Hamill wrote, adding that he was “horrified to later see amputation &amp; unnecessary cruelty—Wampa was HUNGRY (not EVIL)—Luke would never do this!” How upset is he, more than three decades later? His hashtag said it all: “#StillAngry2017” Oh, Mark. Just imagine how the Wampa felt! The End of the Skywalker Saga The Source: Two of those responsible for Episode IX in two years’ time Probability of Accuracy: This almost certainly can’t be true…! The Real Deal: For those who wondered if there was going to be another trilogy in the “Skywalker Saga” after 2019’s Episode IX, the answer might actually surprise you. Speaking with Rolling Stone, J.J. Abrams said, ""I do see it that way,"" when asked if that movie will be the final chapter in the saga. (Although, he added, “the future is in flux,” in case anyone is too scared.) Similarly, Daisy Ridley said that she doesn’t plan on playing Rey again any time soon after IX. “I am really, really excited to do the third thing and round it out, because ultimately, what I was signing on to was three films,” she said. “So in my head, it's three films. I think it will feel like the right time to round it out.” Although she, too, leaves wiggle room in there, saying that she might consider returning in 30 years for another go-around if she’s wanted. “Who knows?” she asked. “I honestly feel like the world may end in the next 30 years, so, if in 30 years we are not living underground in a series of interconnected cells… then sure. Maybe.” Seems promising! More Cantina Talk",Will 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' shake up the whole Jedi-or-Sith thing for good?

Kate Clark,"An investigation by Consumer Reports may force electric scooter businesses to double back on safety measures.
The magazine found electric scooters caused 1,545 injuries in the U.S. since late 2017, according to data collected from 110 hospitals and five public agencies in 47 cities where Bird or Lime, the leading tech-enabled scooter-sharing platforms, operate.
The news comes shortly after UCLA published a study finding that 249 people required medical care following scooter accidents, with one-third of that group arriving at the hospital in an ambulance.
“These injuries can be severe,” Tarak Trivedi, an emergency physician at UCLA and the study’s lead author, told CNET. “These aren’t just minor cuts and scrapes. These are legit fractures.”
Despite commentary from scooter CEOs suggesting otherwise, safety doesn’t seem to be a priority for businesses in the space. Given the nature of the industry, taking a ride on an e-scooter or a dockless bike without a helmet is the norm. That, coupled with failed hardware, irresponsible riding practices and access to scooters in the evening, has unsurprisingly led to several accidents and even casualties. Just this past weekend, the city of Austin reported a pedestrian riding a Lime scooter died after being struck by an Uber driver. The Lime scooter rider was traveling the wrong way down an interstate.
Lime, Bird and other leading scooter providers do provide free helmets to riders and don’t encourage poor scooter etiquette, but ensuring riders actually carry helmets or don’t do stupid things like travel the wrong way down a busy road is impossible.
With a fresh $310 million in Series D funding for Lime, announced today, it will be interesting to see how the company ramps up safety efforts.",An investigation by Consumer Reports may force electric scooter businesses to double back on safety measures.,2019-02-06T18:10:18Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","Investigation finds e-scooters a cause of 1,500+ accidents",http://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/investigation-finds-e-scooters-a-cause-of-1500-accidents/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1073716176.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,force,1
Lucas Matney,"As the developer community prepares for Apple to unveil its latest software efforts at the company’s WWDC keynote later this morning, there are a younger subset of student developers feverishly roaming about excited to see what they can build next too. WWDC is a pretty pricey affair at $1,599 per ticket. Like some other tech companies, Apple has opted to make it a bit easier for students to attend their conference. They’ve done so through a scholarship where younger developers can submit applications and, if selected, get into the event for free with their lodging paid for as well. The more than 350 scholarship recipients this year represented 42 different countries and 34 languages. This year, those students got another added perk as their regular agenda was interrupted by a trip to Steve Jobs Theater on the Apple Park campus and a meet-and-greet with CEO Tim Cook. Later, the exec tweeted a video of what some of the students were working on, saying, “Nothing inspires us more than fresh ideas.” Photo: Apple I had the chance to sit down with a few of these young attendees, the youngest of whom was 16 years old (though students as young as 13 could apply), and chat about some of the things that they were building. “This is my third year at WWDC,” Nathan Flurry, 19, told TechCrunch.”I grew up in a very rural community and I rarely ever left the town, so WWDC was like the first time I got to meet people who cared about the same thing I did.” As part of the application, students had to build and submit an interactive Swift playground that could be experienced in a few minutes. Flurry built a visual programming language powered by Apple Pencil interactions. Another student I chatted with, Joseph Lou, 16, submitted a project for the scholarship that was aiming to recreate the system which the late Stephen Hawking used to communicate. “The app that I built for this scholarship was actually my first app and it was also my first time working with Swift,” Lou said. It was clear that all of these exceedingly bright teens were also working on some pretty big projects of their own. Gabrielle Ecanow, 18, is working on an app called Study Buddy that allows students to coordinate tutoring and studying. Roland Horváth, 17, has built several apps, the latest of which is Try Not to Smile, which plays a bunch of funny videos for users and utilizes the iPhone’s front camera to see how long they can make it without cracking a smile. Harish Yerra, 16, built an app called Greeta that allows users to turn hand-written notes into greeting cards. “I started programming when I was 12, and I just thought it would be super cool to build an iOS app,” Yerra told TechCrunch. “I’d say WWDC 2016 was a major breaking point because that’s when I actually met a couple of my best friends and we went on to build an app…” As the group heads into the conference starting Monday, many of them are focused on using the opportunity to connect with other developers and see what they can build next. “I come back for the connections,” Flurry said. “The keynote is great, I love being here and it’s cool to see it, but I really love being around all of the engineers and meeting other developers who share a passion.”","As the developer community prepares for Apple to unveil its latest software efforts at the company’s WWDC keynote later this morning, there are a younger subset of student developers feverishly roaming about excited to see what they can build next too.

Zack Whittaker,"Prosecutors have brought charges against a former Air Force officer for allegedly spying for Iran, the Justice Department confirmed Wednesday.
Monica Witt, a former Air Force counter-intelligence officer, is accused of defecting to Iran in 2013, after leaving the military in 2008 after more than a decade’s service and later working as a defense contractor.
Prosecutors said the officer, who had the highest level of top secret clearance, disclosed the details of a highly classified intelligence-gathering program and the true identity of a U.S. intelligence officer to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which conducts the country’s cyber-operation, after she stopped working for the U.S. government.
Witt, a former Texas resident, is believed to still be in Iran.
Jay Tabb, FBI executive assistant director for national security, said the indictments follow “years of investigative work,” adding that her alleged actions “could cause serious damage to national security.”
Four other Iranian nationals working for the Revolutionary Guard were also charged by U.S. prosecutors with cyber-offenses relating to targeting U.S. government agents who once worked with Witt. Prosecutors said the “skilled cyber actors” targeted Witt’s former colleagues with malware, which allowed the hackers to spy on the victims’ webcams and keystrokes.
The government also issued sanctions “against malicious Iranian cyber actors and covert operations that have targeted Americans at home and overseas as part of our ongoing efforts to counter the Iranian regimes cyber attacks,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The sanctioned company, New Horizon, is accused of providing financial and technical support to the Revolutionary Guard, including specifically attempting to install malware to compromise the computers of U.S. personnel.

David Murphy,"Website archive services like the Internet Archive: Wayback Machine are incredibly useful for when you need to see old versions of sites—either for nostalgia or because you’re looking for a specific bit of information that has since been overwritten or deleted (like a story you wrote for a former employer, for instance). However, these services aren’t perfect. There are times when an archive site might not make a snapshot of a site—typically, exactly when you need that snapshot most. Or perhaps someone has configured their site’s robots.txt file to block archive services from performing their automatic crawls. No fun. Thanks to a new tool from Motherboard, you can now attempt to archive the current version of a site across three different archive services at once: The Wayback Machine, Archive.is, and Perma.cc (if you’ve set up a free account with them). Installing Motherboard’s archiving utility requires a little bit of legwork, but it’s not too tricky. You’ll first need to install Python’s requests, json, and archiveis modules, which are all required for Motherboard’s mass_archive tool to work. (Alas, this isn’t just some simple executable or utility you can run.) The best way to install them requests and json is to install pip first, and then use that to download the modules. You’ll find archiveis here, and you can install it using pip as well. You’ll also need to grab the mass_archive.py script from the aforementioned GitHub project. Once you’re ready, pull up a terminal in macOS or Linux and type this in (obviously, replacing example.com with the website you’re looking to archive): python mass_archive.py example.com If you’re using Python via an elevated command prompt in Windows, you can omit the initial “python” from that code.",Website archive services like the Internet Archive: Wayback Machine are incredibly useful for when you need to see old versions of sites—either for nostalgia or because you’re looking for a specific bit of information that has since been overwritten or delete…,2018-05-02T17:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",Force Archive Websites to Pick up Webpages with This Handy Tool,https://lifehacker.com/force-archive-websites-to-pick-up-webpages-with-this-ha-1825715506,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--v3zHcWUh--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/mw083dpyyoxe2tyi60dh.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,force,1
Angela Watercutter,"Pssst! Hey, buddy. Have you gotten your tickets for Avengers: Endgame yet? Well, if you were hoping to go on opening weekend, chances are you might be out of luck. According to the latest projections, the movie is on track to make $200-250 million in its opening weekend and online ticket retailers are struggling to keep up.
If the movie hits the top end of those projections, it'll handily beat Star Wars: The Force Awakens. (Remember how hardthose tickets were to get?). If Endgame brings in more than $257.6 million, it'll beat out its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War, for the biggest domestic opening weekend of all time.
And it should. Not necessarily because people reading the box office runes predict that it will, but because it's the culmination of 20-plus movies going back 11 years, the film that will bring together all of their narrative threadsor at least try to. It is, to put it hyperbolically, the event movie to end all event movies. The endgame in every sense of the word. Infinity War was too, and now that Marvel is finally putting a bow on its Phase 3 package, we all get to share in its gifts.
Nobody wants to be the person at the watercooler on Monday who hasn't seen Endgame, so people are rushing to secure their tickets, clogging AMC's online ticketing site and breaking first-day sales records on Fandango (crushingyou guessed itThe Force Awakens).
This may prove to be a singular achievement; as Marvel moves into Phase 4 it'll likely keep churning out good movies, but it's hard to imagine the studio will ever again have a crossover event of this magnitude. Also, its impending box office feat is already under threat. When Star Wars: Episode IX hits theaters on December 20, it could easily supersede its Disney sibling. Both franchises have massive fanbases, but Star Wars has been around for decades longer than the Marvel films. Not to mention that Episode IX is not only the final film of the current trilogy, it's also the end of the Skywalker Saga, which has been going on since 1977. If all those generations of fans turn out opening weekend, the box office opening weekend numbers will far eclipse Endgame's.
And, let's face it: If it's not Star Wars, it'll be something else. Franchises are constantly leapfrogging each other for the title of Biggest Opening Weekend these days. A quick look at the 25 top grossers of all time shows a long list of comic book films, Lucasfilm offerings, Harry Potters, Star Warses, and YA moviesall of them released in the last two decades or so. Another monster movie will come soon, and the Avengers' reign will come to an, ahem, end.

Issie Lapowsky,"Devaki Raj leaned over a gilded railing inside Times Squares Marriott Marquis last Thursday, racking her brain to find the words that wont get her in trouble.
Minutes before, she had stood confidently in front of a conference room full of investors, academics, military contractors, and Air Force acquisitions officers to deliver a slick pitch as part of the Air Forces first ever startup demo day. In her pitch, Raj explained how her company, CrowdAI, has mixed machine learning with mapping technology to identify flooded Texas roadways in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, or decimated buildings after bombings in Aleppo. The pitch, delivered to a closed-door crowd the day before, had already earned CrowdAI a small grant from the Air Force, which she hopes will soon blossom into a formal military contract.
But now, Raj was finding it trickier to answer my questions about what this technology might be used for in practice by the militaryor in war. When I asked if there are some applications of the tool that she would consider off limits, she said yes, but declined to name any in particular. After a little soul-searching and a whole lot of self-editing, she offered, We would like to make sure our technology is used for good.""
For technologists like Raj, it's a topic littered with landmines. Over the past year, tech workers have revolted against working with the military. At Google, where Raj started her career working on the Maps team, employee backlash last year drove the company to pull out of a Pentagon program called Project Maven, which is using artificial intelligence to improve computer vision for applications like drone targeting. Just last month, Microsoft workers wrote to CEO Satya Nadella and President Brad Smith, asking them to cancel a $479 million Army contract that would let soldiers use Microsofts augmented-reality technology, HoloLens, to train for battle. We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used, the letter read.
Landing a government contract has traditionally been a grueling and laborious process, requiring companies to comply with a list of regulations which, when printed out, weigh 8.5 pounds. Thats discouraged lots of startups from even trying.
Nadella rejected their demands in an interview with CNN, saying, We're not going to withhold technology from institutions that we have elected in democracies to protect the freedoms we enjoy. The response drew scrutiny from Nadellas fellow technologists, and even prompted a New York Times columnist to compare tech military contracts to Dow Chemicals development of Napalm during the Vietnam War.
These headlines haveinconvenientlyemerged around the same time the Air Force and other military branches are desperately looking for partners in the commercial tech sector. The Pentagon views tapping into Silicon Valley's expertise as essential to competing in an arms race that may hinge on developing technologies like artificial intelligence. But landing a government contract has traditionally been a grueling and laborious process, requiring companies to comply with a list of regulations which, when printed out, weigh 8.5 pounds. Thats discouraged lots of startups from even trying to compete, and prevented the government from accessing some of the freshest emerging ideas in tech.
With the demo day in New York, the Air Force wanted to shrink that process. Over the course of one day, Raj and 50 other grantees walked away with $3.5 million in initial funding, with another $5 million set to be paid out in installments. On average, it took 15 minutes from the end of their pitches for the funds to be transferred into the companies' bank accounts, using an Air Force credit card. (And yes, the folks running the event did get some frantic calls from payment processors wondering why the US government was spending millions of dollars in $50,000 increments in Times Square.)
The Air Force now plans to hold pitch days across the country in the years to come. But convincing idealistic tech workers to partner with the military requires more than a mobile card swiper, says Dr. Will Roper, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics. Weve got to learn a different language, he says, one that doesnt involve much talk of war and weaponry.
Instead, the Pentagon needs to do a better job appealing to the values of todays tech companies and helping them understand the range of opportunities within the DoD. Were certainly not going to criticize someone for having belief systems they adhere to. But our Air Force mission is broad, Roper says. So if you dont want to work with us on weapons systems, but you do want to work on medicine or green energy or data analytics, we should have an open door that fits the needs of the partnership.
As a result, pitch day didn't include much of what Roper calls ""war-fighter talk,"" with the exception of one Airman who received a round of applause for his story of survival after being hit by an RPG. Instead, the day revolved around the softer side of military technology. Securisyn Medical, which is based in Colorado, pitched a piece of hardware that prevents breathing tubes from becoming accidentally dislodged when wounded soldiers are bouncing around in the back of a humvee or a helicopter. Consul Systems, a Virginia-based firm, talked about enhancing cybersecurity on internet-connected devices. And Hivemapper, which is based in California and is entering its second round of Air Force funding, showed off its tool that automatically turns video into 3D models of a given area, which can be used for disaster recovery efforts.
There was scarcely a mention, though, of how a tool like Hivemapper could be used to model out where the Air Force should drop a bomb. And yet, according to Miles Sackler, the companys director of customer engineering, thats an ongoing conversation with staff. We think its important that companies going after this are aware of what the use cases are, he says. We dont want to be throwing our product over the rail and saying, Go figure it out.
Sacklers team isnt running from war-fighter talk, though. Just walking away from anything offensive has a lot of longer-reaching impacts, Sackler says. Within the confines of the regulations, the law  our job is to help support [the Air Force] and honor what their mission is.
If these sorts of ethical dilemmas were weighing on the dozens of startups gathered inside the Marriott last week, it didn't show. Instead, they whooped and applauded when one speaker noted that about half the companies in the room had never worked with the government before, and laughed when another joked that it's now quicker to get an Air Force contract than it is to get a beer in New York City.
Roper says that the success of this experiment and the conversations he's had with startups across the country suggest that all those headlines about the battle between tech companies and the Pentagon are the exception, not the rule. In fact, even Google has said it will continue to work on Defense contracts, despite its reservations about Project Maven. And Amazon's Jeff Bezos has insisted that his company will continue to work with the military and is considered the front-runner for the Pentagon's $10 billion cloud-computing contract, known as JEDI.
""I think the exceptions are more newsworthy, but they skew what is reality, and that is that people thank our military men and women for their service,"" Roper says. Of course, there's a difference between honoring the country's service people and actively building tools of wara leap prominent tech companies and their employees seem unwilling to make.
The challenge is, these same tech giantsthese exceptionsemploy some of the brightest minds in their fields. The Air Force could throw a dozen pitch days. It could fund hundreds more entrepreneurs like Raj. But Google would probably still have more resources and expertise than all of those startups combined. If the US military loses the faith of these tech giants, specifically the talent working within them, that could put the country at a competitive disadvantage against its adversaries for generations to come.
It's a tension Roper understands all too well. ""Although I disagree with not wanting to support the military, were a country that's based on the freedom to disagree, and so were certainly not, as a military that defends our freedoms, going to gamesay the practice of that freedom,"" he says, pausing before adding, ""But we are going to get out and partner, and hopefully change peoples minds.""

Matt Novak,"The U.S. Air Force published a video overnight showing its latest missile test from Tuesday. But the Air Force insists that the test is not related to any real world events. The unarmed Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 11:01pm local time on Tuesday. The missile, which is capable of carrying up to three thermonuclear devices, was launched over the Pacific Ocean and landed near the Kwajalein Atoll roughly 4,200 miles to the west. The test is fairly routine, but most missile tests conducted by the U.S. military over the past two years have been viewed with a strange air of anxiety as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea have gotten worse. President Donald Trump has noted that North Korea ceased tests since his meeting with Kim Jong Un in June, but experts have pointed out that the country no longer needs to conduct extensive tests now that its actually achieved reliable nuclear missiles. The Air Force insists that its latest test has nothing to do with anything thats happening with other nations but didnt mention any countries by name. Operational test launches of the Minuteman III provide valuable data to planners and holistically test the system, procedures and airmen from the initial mission planning to the final weapons employment phases, Air Force officials said in a statement to the San Luis Obispo Tribune. These tests are not related to any real world events. What real world events could they be talking about? Observers are concerned about hot spots around the globe like Iran and Venezuela. Both appear to be on the Trump regimes short list for tough talk, along with plenty of other nations. National Security Advisor John Bolton recently dubbed Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as a troika of tyranny, a clumsy name that seems unlikely to stick. The last ICBM test conducted by the U.S. was on July 31, 2018 but didnt work out as planned. The test was canceled due to an anomaly, thought the Air Force didnt get any more specific than that. But Americans seem unlikely to give this latest test much thought anyway. Theres plenty of other stuff to worry about on the homefront, including outright assaults on freedom of the press, and a worsening constitutional crisis after Attorney General Jeff Sessions was fired yesterday. And all of that is to say nothing of the continuing gun violence that plagues the country.

Garrett M. Graff,"In the midafternoon of January 11, 2007, US Air Force major general William Shelton sat at the head of a table in a command center at California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base, holding a telephone to each ear. Shelton was the commander in charge of maintaining the US military’s “situational awareness” in space—and the situation, at the moment, seemed to be deteriorating fast. One phone connected Shelton to his boss, the head of US Strategic Command, in Nebraska; the other connected to Shelton’s operations center, a windowless room full of analysts just next door. In front of Shelton was a can of Diet Dr Pepper, and arrayed around the table were the members of his increasingly nervous senior staff. For days, US intelligence had been picking up indications that China was about to conduct a missile test aimed at outer space. The analysts next door—and their counterparts around the world—were tracking ground-based radar signals, monitoring infrared sensors, and poring over images from telescopes in space. All of them were briefing Shelton on what they were observing in real time. At 2:28 pm (PST) their readouts showed a ballistic missile taking off from China’s Xichang Satellite Launch Center, located in the wooded mountains of Sichuan province. The missile rose into low Earth orbit, about 500 miles above Earth’s surface, and appeared to close in on an aging Chinese weather satellite. Then the telescopes showed a bright flash. Minutes later, the radar screens began to track a growing cloud of debris—at least 3,000 pieces of shrapnel that would each, Shelton knew, spend the next several years slingshotting around Earth at speeds that could far exceed that of a bullet. Shelton was stunned. The Chinese had just shot a satellite out of the sky. Not only was this a stupendous technological achievement—to launch a missile from the ground and hit a celestial target moving as fast as 17,000 mph—it also showed a level of audacity not seen in space for decades. “We couldn’t imagine they would go against an actual satellite,” Shelton recalls. “Because of the debris something like that creates, it’s almost unthinkable.” It felt like a wake-up call. In the conference room, Shelton exhaled, set down his two telephones, and pushed himself back from the table. “This changes everything,” he said to his staff. For decades, America’s satellites had circled Earth at a largely safe remove from the vicissitudes of geopolitics. An informal global moratorium on the testing of anti-satellite weapons had held since 1985; the intervening decades had been a period of post–Cold War peace—and unquestioned American supremacy—high overhead. During those decades, satellites had become linchpins of the American military apparatus and the global economy. By 2007, ships at sea and warplanes in the air had grown reliant on instant satellite communications with ground stations thousands of miles away. Government forecasters relied on weather satellites; intelligence analysts relied on high-­resolution imagery to anticipate and track adversaries the world over. GPS had become perhaps the single most indispensable global system ever designed by humans—the infrastructure upon which the rest of the world’s infrastructure is based. (Fourteen of the 16 infrastructure sectors designated as critical by the Department of Homeland Security, like energy and financial services, rely on GPS for their operation.) Now, Shelton feared, all those satellites overhead had become so many huge, unarmored, billion-dollar sitting ducks. In the decade since China’s first successful anti-satellite missile test, Shelton’s premonition has largely come true: Everything has changed in space. A secretive, pitched arms race has opened up between the US, China, Russia, and, to a lesser extent, North Korea. The object of the race: to devise more and better ways to quickly cripple your adversary’s satellites. After decades of uncontested US supremacy, multinational cooperation, and a diplomatic consensus on reserving space for peaceful uses, military officials have begun referring to Earth’s orbit as a new “warfighting domain.” On the ground, the military is starting to retrain pilots, ship captains, and ground troops in fail-safe forms of navigation that don’t rely on GPS—like celestial navigation. The US military must relearn how to fight “unwired” and defend itself in space. “We knew how to do that, and somehow we forgot,” General John E. Hyten, the head of US Strategic Command, said in 2015. When former director of national intelligence James Clapper left office at the end of the Obama administration, he told me that the increasing sophistication of America’s adversaries in space was one of the top three strategic threats he worried about. Clapper’s successor, Dan Coats, warned last spring that “Russia and China remain committed to developing capabilities to challenge perceived adversaries in space, especially the United States.” Since he took office, President Trump has dropped numerous hints of the warnings he’s evidently getting from military and intelligence leaders. During a spring livestream with astronauts aboard the International Space Station, he alluded, obliquely and without context, to the “tremendous military applications in space.” And he has repeatedly floated the idea of creating a new branch of the armed forces specifically for celestial combat—culminating last week with a speech out-and-out ordering the Joint Chiefs of Staff to begin developing plans for a new “ Space Force.” But if space is indeed becoming a war-­fighting domain, it’s important to understand the stakes, not just for America’s strategic standing but for the species. A Russo-Sino-American space war could very well end with a crippled global economy, inoperable infrastructure, and a planet shrouded by the orbiting fragments of pulverized satellites—which, by the way, could hinder us all on Earth until we figured out a way of cleaning them up. In the aftermath of such a conflict, it might be years before we could restore new constellations of satellites to orbit. Preparing for orbital war has fast become a priority of the US military, but the more urgent priority is figuring out how to prevent it. Growing up in Oklahoma City, William Shelton dreamed of becoming a pilot. He got as far as the Air Force Academy before he discovered his eyes weren’t good enough. So instead he became an astronomical engineer. In 1976 he began serving as a launch facility manager at Vandenberg Air Force Base, the military’s oldest space and missile launch base, perched on the California coast north of Santa Barbara. He arrived just as the Air Force was beginning to understand how crucial space would be to its future: The nation’s first early-warning satellites had been put in orbit with the intention of tracking Soviet missile launches, and satellite imagery was becoming increasingly critical to intelligence gathering. Shelton’s poor eyesight, it turned out, had led him to the center of the Air Force’s new frontier. In August 1990, Shelton, then a young lieutenant colonel, took command of the 2nd Space Operations Squadron in Colorado. When he arrived at his post, the Air Force was busy building a new constellation of satellites—launching new ones from Cape Canaveral in Florida every few months to help fill out what he was told would ultimately be a global system aimed at helping the US improve its navigation and increase the precision of its bombs and missiles. This was the new Global Positioning System, and one of Shelton’s first duties at “2Sops” was to build support and enthusiasm for the new effort. To impress visitors (including the brass), he carried around a demo GPS unit that weighed 10 pounds, cost $3,000, and could tell America’s soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines exactly where they were on the surface of the planet. The power of the new system that 2Sops ran was proven faster than anyone imagined. The Gulf War caused a rush of final preparations to get GPS ready for battle. Around 2:30 am on January 17, 1991, GPS-equipped helicopters snuck into Iraq, using the technology to guide themselves through the darkened desert and knock out air defense radars. The first bombing campaign of the war had begun. Reporters marveled at precision-­guided bombs zeroing in on their targets and cruise missiles appearing to turn street corners to hit the right buildings. Shelton had a front-row seat to this transformation. As the technology has improved, so has the precision of GPS. The system originally provided accuracy to within 17 yards; with it, you could pinpoint a specific copse of pine trees. Today, if you’re using a smartphone, it can generally locate an object to within five yards—a resolution fine enough to locate a pair of pine trees within that copse. Soon it could be able to zero in on a pine cone: Research from UC Riverside has demonstrated that the latest tech is reliable to within an inch. And research has shown that 1-millimeter accuracy might be eventually possible—which means that the system could locate an individual seed inside that pine cone. Today, troops on the ground use GPS to navigate foreign streets; drone pilots can program a flight plan from thousands of miles away. And because GPS satellites also house America’s detection system for nuclear detonations, we rely on them to tell us if North Korea launches a nuclear weapon, and to tell our missiles and bombs where to find their targets. “When you look at our American way of war, the strategy is largely underpinned by space assets—navigation, early warning, timing,” Shelton says. And that’s just the military. The creators of GPS probably never intended for the system to become the backbone of daily life, but it has. I visited Colorado while reporting this story and tried to keep tabs on everything I did that relied on GPS. There were the obvious navigational moments—my Uber ride to the airport, my American Airlines flight to Denver, my own Google Maps–guided drive in a rental car to Schriever Air Force Base, outside Colorado Springs. But there were also less obvious instances, like the phone calls I made along the way (cellular networks rely on GPS data to keep their stations synchronized), my stop at the ATM (banks use GPS to track deposits and withdrawals), and the fill-up at the gas station (the credit card system also relies on GPS). Moreover, GPS is no longer the world’s sole geolocating mechanism. Russia, China, and the European Union have now all either deployed or begun working on their own full constellations of navigation satellites, ensuring that they won’t have to rely on the US system. It also means that, in the early moments of a war, it’s a fair bet that satellites—the other guy’s satellites—could be among the first targets. During the Cold War, a US army mountain outpost in the Fulda Gap, the shortest route between East and West Germany, served as an early warning trip wire for a Soviet invasion of Europe. If Russian tanks ever made a surprise attack, NATO planners knew that the soldiers there would likely be the first to find out. Today, the members of 2Sops play a similar role. Deep inside the squat, beige, windowless Building 400 at Schriever Air Force Base—the destination I had plugged into Google Maps during my trip to Colorado—10 people at a time remotely operate the heavenly constellation of GPS satellites that guide Tomahawk cruise missiles to their targets, deliver Lyft passengers to their destinations, and help farmers cultivate their crops. They also watch out for any shocks or attacks on the system. The average GPS operators are in their mid-twenties. During one recent shift, the entire Global Positioning System was being operated by two 19-year-old airmen (who, the Air Force emphasizes, are rigorously trained). Their commander, US Air Force lieutenant colonel Peter Norsky, is in his mid-thirties. Together, they watch over the roughly three dozen GPS satellites, troubleshooting the geolocation system and minding the quirks of each orbiting craft—this one’s damaged solar panels, that one’s balky communications links—as if they were remotely tending a stable full of temperamental horses. As integral as GPS is to daily life, the way it actually works is little understood by most people outside of Schriever Air Force Base. Fundamentally, the function of GPS is to provide the globe with a shared clock. GPS satellites allow phone companies to keep their systems in sync, battleships to chart open waters, and ATMs to time-stamp their transactions by triangulating signals from overhead and measuring how long it takes those signals from different satellites to reach a GPS receiver. Any malfunction in the GPS system threatens to plunge the global economy into chaos. The system works by making daily calculations, employing Newtonian physics and Einsteinian relativity, to minutely tweak the time broadcast from each GPS satellite as it moves through space—the high-tech version of tuning your grandfather clock to within 100-­billionths of a second. Time is, after all, relative; as of January, the time in space was 18 seconds ahead of Earth’s “Coordinated Universal Time,” since space doesn’t recognize the leap seconds that scientists add to terrestrial time to account for the planet’s slowing rotation. Additionally, the time-keeping device on each satellite gives a subtly different reading, the result of variations in their atomic clocks, which tell time by measuring the precise oscillations of an atom. (Some GPS satellites use rubidium atoms, which are highly accurate day to day; some use cesium, which is more accurate over long stretches.) Any malfunction in the GPS system threatens to plunge the global economy into chaos. Fortunately those glitches are rare, but they’re not unheard of. On January 25, 2016, one of 2Sops’ flight commanders, Captain Aaron Blain, was awoken by a call from work in the middle of the night. User reports from around the country suggested that the system’s precision had “wobbled,” making measurements increasingly inaccurate. Blain raced to Schriever in his Ford pickup and found that the constellation’s timing was off by about 13 microseconds. It was an infinitesimal number—over 25,000 times shorter than the blink of an eye—but for the finely tuned GPS it was a yawning crevice. Left uncorrected, the glitch could have ricocheted through the global economy, corrupting not just driving directions but stock trades too. Alongside the rest of his team, Blain worked through the night, chugging Mountain Dew. It took about six hours to locate the problem—a single corrupted measurement—and then individually reset the affected satellites. (Russia’s GPS equivalent, known as Glonass, has suffered even more serious issues. In 2014 it went down for 10 hours, but many Glonass receivers can also use GPS as a backup, so the systemic chaos was limited.) 2Sops averted a benign catastrophe that night, but it seems increasingly worried about what China and Russia are doing up in the heavens, out of sight. It recently doubled the number of airmen who oversee the satellites, so one team can run the GPS constellation while another trains to face worst-case scenarios—what the Pentagon refers to as “a contested, degraded, and ­operationally limited environment.” That is, a space war. In one respect, space is already like a war zone: It’s increasingly shot through with flying shrapnel. By some estimates, there are more than 100 million pieces of debris zipping around in Earth’s orbit. China’s 2007 anti-satellite test is estimated to have created some 150,000 new ones, many too small to be tracked. In 2013, some of those fragments hit a Russian satellite—threatening to add still more debris to the orbital mix. And as commercial ventures like SpaceX and Blue Origin ramp up their space tourism plans, Earth’s orbit is about to get even more crowded with both junk and spacecraft. Scientists say there could be a point at which the density of objects spinning around the planet reaches a threshold—called the Kessler effect—that triggers a runaway cascade of collisions: an entire orbit, in other words, set to Blend. Another tricky thing about space debris is that sometimes it isn’t just debris. A US military program called the Space Surveillance Network carefully tracks and monitors every piece of space junk that’s larger than a softball. That currently amounts to some 20,000 objects—everything from old satellite parts to discarded rocket boosters to a pair of pliers lost during an astronaut’s spacewalk. In 2014, a piece of presumptive space junk known to the US military as Object 2014-28E began to behave strangely. The object, known to be of Russian origin, started to perform complicated maneuvers. “That’s concerning—when you see something that appears to be debris come to life,” Shelton says. Object 2014-28E was, in fact, an autonomous spacecraft capable of veering off course and sidling up to other objects, including American commercial communications satellites. In the years since, Object 2014-28E has been joined by similar space objects of Russian provenance. Analysts fear that they might mark the revival of a Russian program known as Satellite Killer, which was shut down after the Cold War. But it’s difficult, even for US government analysts, to know for certain whether that fear is warranted. The secrecy that surrounds nearly everything space-related makes it hard to assess any adversary’s capabilities. Discerning intentions is especially difficult. “If I wanted to build a satellite that looked very different from its actual mission, that’s not hard to do,” Shelton says. A satellite that maneuvers close to another could be doing a repair job or squaring up for an attack—and it might use the same tools for both. “Small satellites with small grappling arms—they have both military and nonmilitary uses,” says Dean Cheng, who studies China’s military capabilities at the Heritage Foundation. “If I manipulate a satellite’s bits and pieces, I can also rip something out.” The US has also been secretive in developing what may or may not be weapons in space. Last May, the Air Force announced that an unmanned space-shuttle-like vehicle that appears to be classified had completed 718 days orbiting Earth, doing who knows what. As of this May, another OTV was circling the globe, more than 200 days into its mostly classified mission. Todd Harrison, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, explains that there are effectively four categories of space weapons: kinetic (aimed at destroying a satellite), nonkinetic (aimed at disabling a satellite without touching it), electromagnetic (aimed at interfering with a satellite’s signals), and cyber (aimed at corrupting the data sent to a satellite). No country can claim sovereignty in orbit. So what counts as an act of territorial aggression? What qualifies as a proportional response? The US tested its own anti-satellite missile in 2008, shooting down an errant spy satellite as it was falling out of orbit. Russia has repeatedly flight-tested a so-called direct ascent weapon, the PL-19 Nudol ballistic missile, which could strike objects in orbit, although it hasn’t conducted a live attack on an orbiting satellite. And in the decade since China shot down its weather satellite in 2007, Beijing has launched multiple ballistic missile tests that extended into orbit. In addition, a trio of Chinese satellites have practiced “close-proximity operations,” similar to those performed by the Russian Object 2014-28E. Anti-satellite weapons form just one part of what China calls shashoujian, or “assassin’s mace” systems, which can be used at the start of an attack to achieve a surprise, decisive advantage over a technologically superior foe. There’s also the growing challenge of cyberattacks on satellites: Chinese hackers have reportedly infiltrated the US weather satellite system, and a Romanian hacker announced that he had accessed the server of one of NASA’s space flight centers. In the past decade, at least two nonmilitary US satellite systems have experienced brief, unattributed glitches tied to hacking attacks. Some actors have begun to exploit the fragility not of satellites themselves, but of the signals they broadcast. By the time the radio signals from a GPS satellite reach Earth from thousands of miles up, they can be easily overridden by a stronger signal broadcast on the same frequency. Simple GPS jammers sell online for $119, but they have a short reach. Militaries appear to be acquiring much more powerful jamming technologies. In 2016, roughly 1,000 planes and 700 vessels at sea reportedly experienced problems with their GPS signals near North Korea, which is believed to have purchased Russian jammers that can be mounted on trucks. Those devices have an effective radius of 30 to 60 miles. The US seems to possess similar technology; a test that went awry near a Navy base in San Diego in 2007 knocked out GPS signals to cell phone network operators for at least two hours. More troubling than simple jamming, though, is the rise of “spoofing,” which overrides correct GPS data with a more powerful localized signal that delivers false information to a receiver. In 2013 a team of researchers from the University of Texas at Austin successfully led astray an $80 million yacht in the Mediterranean, overpowering its GPS receivers and sending it onto a new course. The dirty truth about spoofing is that secure channels are no defense against it. “Even our encrypted military GPS receivers can be spoofed,” Harrison says. Shelton, who retired in 2014 after 38 years in the Air Force, lives not far from 2Sops in Colorado; these days he chairs an educational and advocacy nonprofit called the Space Foundation. He still expends a lot of energy worrying about what is happening in the heavens. “We as a nation have been too slow to respond to this threat,” he says. He’s particularly troubled by the failure of the US to procure new space systems. Some GPS satellites are older than the people running them. “Our systems are archaic,” Shelton says. “Because space assets are so expensive, we deploy ‘just enough’; there’s no backup or excess capability.” (The Air Force noted that the GPS constellation consists of more than 30 satellites, which provides some redundancy.) China, by contrast, is investing heavily in its space program, seeing it as a symbol of its growing prominence. As soon as this year, it could land a craft on the never-before-touched far side of the moon. And China’s global navigation satellite system, known as BeiDou, has some capabilities that outmatch even the United States’ GPS. In 2015, China created a new space-­focused military service, known as the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force. Meanwhile, the US relies entirely on Russian rockets to get its astronauts to the Space Station (although NASA has awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to fix that). As Cheng says, “Today China is one of two countries that can put a person into space—and the other country isn’t the United States.” Many of America’s space warriors, as they call themselves, share Shelton’s sense that the US isn’t responding nearly quickly enough to the threat of orbital war. “We needed to be marching faster,” says Deborah Lee James, who served as President Obama’s secretary of the Air Force. “Why aren’t there more space and cyber officers at the top of the Air Force?” Deadly Debris In orbit, trash becomes shrapnel. When objects in space collide—whether by accident or because, say, someone down on Earth has decided to launch a missile at a satellite—it sometimes creates a hail of smaller fragments that fan out across Earth’s orbit. It’s already getting difficult to operate satellites and conduct launches amid all the junk zipping around up there. That’s why, around the world, scientists and engineers are devising ways to pull space junk out of orbit. In April, a SpaceX rocket carried a collection of experimental debris-removal technologies to the International Space Station. During its time in orbit, the satellite will test out nets, harpoons, and drag sails designed to reduce detritus. — Saraswati Rathod 20,000 Pieces of space debris larger than a softball — 500,000 Pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger — 4,300 Number of satellites in space — 72 Percent of satellites that are non­functioning — $1.4 billion Cost of degradation to commercial satellites caused by debris — 2,000 Number of trackable fragments created by the last major satellite collision in 2009 — 160 million Estimated number of pieces of space junk too small to be tracked — Sources: European Space Agency; NASA; Aerospace Corporation Addressing these issues, as James’ question suggests, is not just about throwing money at the space-industrial complex. It involves organizational changes too. The Air Force is building what it calls the nation’s first Space Mission Force, made up of airmen trained to respond to the demands of an orbital war. On the same base as the 2Sops command center, the military has established the National Space Defense Center, which puts representatives from various military and intelligence offices focused on space under a single roof. And the defense authorization bill is full of upgrades to the Air Force’s space-­fighting capabilities, including the creation of an additional Air Force unit responsible for space warfighting operations. Not content to tinker with the Air Force, a growing number of people in Washington—including the commander in chief—have to come to favor creating an entire new military branch dedicated to space operations. In May, during a ceremony honoring West Point’s football team, President Trump told his audience, “We’re getting very big in space, both militarily and for other reasons, and we are seriously thinking of the Space Force.” The comment sounded to many listeners like yet another oddball Trumpian tangent. But then, after reportedly meeting resistance from the Air Force, Trump escalated. At a mid-June meeting of the newly constituted US Space Council, he announced—much to the surprise of his own advisors and the military itself—that he was ordering the Pentagon to move forward. As he said, “I’m hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces. That’s a big statement. We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force—separate but equal. It’s going to be something.” The Space Force is, of course, not a fait accompli. Any military reorganization has to be approved by Congress—which is not necessarily an easy path. (Last year, a bill that included the creation of just such a new branch of the military passed the US House of Representatives, but that provision was taken out of the Senate version.) And the establishment of a new branch of the military involves a vast set of logistical and structural questions. Yet Trump’s push may speed up a natural evolution toward an independent space branch by years, if not a decade. Space, the president said, was “going to be important monetarily and militarily. We don’t want China and Russia and other countries leading us. We’ve always led.” But where—and to what—are we leading? Part of the challenge in figuring out how to think about space conflict is the sheer complexity of the orbital environment—an arena that has long belonged to nation-states, but that is increasingly becoming a domain of commerce and tourism. How do countries protect their interests up above—and down here? Right now, countries appear to be racing to build their military capabilities—but an arms race isn’t the only answer. The last time an arms race appeared poised to overtake space, the world’s superpowers banded together to sign the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which banned weapons of mass destruction in space and held that “the moon and other celestial bodies” should be reserved for peaceful purposes. The Outer Space Treaty is still in force, but it is by now full of holes. Legal scholars had a hard time proving that China’s 2007 anti-­satellite test, for instance, violated the agreement. That’s because the missile that China fired was not technically addressed in the 50-year-old treaty. Part of what makes space such volatile terrain right now is that it’s hard even to apply the existing laws of war to it. No country can claim sovereignty in orbit, and it’s impossible to occupy territory there. So what counts as an act of territorial aggression? What qualifies as a proportional response? It’s even difficult to say, with certainty, what the physics of war in space will look like. We don’t well understand, for instance, how a kinetic attack on a satellite constellation might spill over into a spiraling Kessler effect. Humans have “millennia of experience in blowing up things on land,” says Laurie Blank, a law professor at Emory University and a specialist in the laws of armed conflict. “We’re still learning the consequences of all these things in space.” Blank recently joined together with an international team of legal experts to create what they’re calling the Woomera Manual on the International Law of Military Space Operations—a kind of rule book for celestial international conflict, one that will endeavor to translate the laws of terrestrial war for space. It’s a daunting task, and the resulting document will be nonbinding. But, Blank says, it’s a necessary first step for anyone who would seek to contain a conflict that has, in some senses, already begun. Garrett M. Graff ( @vermontgmg ) is a WIRED contributing editor.

Mariella Moon,"Magistrate judge Kandis Westmore stressed that law enforcement doesn't have the right to force people to unlock their phones even with a warrant, thereby declaring that biometrics are equal to passcodes. Courts commonly allow biometric unlocks, because judges don't consider body parts ""testimonial."" The reason being, people have to give up passwords and passcodes verbally and willingly, so they're covered under the Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination. Westmore wrote in her ruling:
""If a person cannot be compelled to provide a passcode because it is a testimonial communication, a person cannot be compelled to provide one's finger, thumb, iris, face, or other biometric feature to unlock that same device.
The undersigned finds that a biometric feature is analogous to the 20 nonverbal, physiological responses elicited during a polygraph test, which are used to determine guilt or innocence, and are considered testimonial.""
Westmore noted that ""technology is outpacing the law"" and that the government has other means to solve the case. In this particular instance, investigators can obtain Messenger communications from Facebook itself with a proper warrant under the Stored Communications Act. According to Forbes, Facebook had been willing to hand over messages to authorities for a significant number of previous cases, so there's really no reason investigators can't go that route. While Westmore's decision is out of the norm and can still be overturned, EFF senior staff attorney Andrew Crocker said it's worth noting that ""courts are beginning to look at these issues on their own terms.""","Authorities can't force people to unlock devices with their faces, fingers or irises, a magistrate judge from California has ruled.

"Ryan Browne, CNN","(CNN) Establishing President Donald Trump's sought-after Space Force could cost $12.9 billion over its first five years, according to an Air Force document obtained by CNN. The Air Force estimates that the first year ""additive costs"" associated with establishing the new military branch in the 2020 fiscal year, including the creation of a headquarters, would amount to $3.32 billion. The document also estimates that the Space Force will oversee some 13,000 personnel when it is officially launched. In a memo accompanying the proposal, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson calls on Congress to authorize and fund the establishment of a Space Force headquarters in the 2020 fiscal year. ""This would build the foundation of the new department first, allowing us to transfer personnel and programs in FY21 after Congressional approval,"" she wrote in a memo dated September 14. The proposal recommends that a Space Force Secretariat, headquarters staff, Space Force troop contingent and a Space combatant command be established and funded before any space personnel from the other military branches are transferred into the Space Force. Wilson also pushed back on a recent Pentagon proposal to create a senior civilian defense post to oversee the creation of a Space Force, calling it a detour and saying it ""is not in line"" with President Donald Trump's intent to create a new military branch focused on space. The decision to create the civilian post was announced by Vice President Mike Pence in August at a Pentagon event to mark the release of an interim Department of Defense report on the military and space, a report overseen by Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan. ""We will create a single civilian position, reporting to the Secretary of Defense, to oversee the growth and expansion of this new branch of service. This position will be a new Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space. And this leader will be key to the critical transition to a fully independent Secretary of the Space Force in the years ahead,"" Pence said. But Wilson called such interim steps ""detours that do not support the President's policy position to establish a new military department."" ""Establishing an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space or new defense bureaucracy, or moving programs to a temporary holding organization, in not in line with the President's intent,"" Wilson wrote. The proposal also seeks to create the Space Development Agency from the Air Force's pre-existing Space Rapid Capabilities office. It also calls for the next director of the National Reconnaissance Office to serve simultaneously as the director of the Air Force Space Rapid Capabilities Office to establish ""unit of command for these organizations."" Shanahan would not offer a cost estimate in the administration's space proposals last month.","Establishing President Donald Trump's sought-after Space Force could cost $12.9 billion over its first five years, according to an Air Force document obtained by CNN.",2018-09-17T19:53:43Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Trump's Space Force could cost nearly $13 billion over 5 years,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/17/politics/trump-space-force-cost/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170706152044-space-corps-bill-trnd-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,force,1

 Passengers were told to take the 'Sakai muscle' line
Osaka's metro network has shut down its foreign language sites after users noticed some odd translations.
Among the errors on its English page was the literal translation of Sakaisuji line as ""Sakai muscle"".
Many Japanese businesses are trying to make themselves accessible for foreign visitors, ahead of the rugby world cup this year and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Officials say they used the same Microsoft translation programme for all of the metro's non-Japanese pages.
As well as being told to take the ""muscle line"", passengers were advised to alight at stations called ""Before the Zoo"" (Dobutsuen-mae), ""Powerhouse Town"" (Daikokucho), ""Prince Bridge Now City"" (Taishibashi-Imaichi) and ""World Teahouse"" (Tengachaya).
""Third carriage"", meanwhile, rather unsettlingly became ""three eyes"".
Members of the public noticed the odd names and posted photos on social media, causing the Japanese hashtags for ""Sakai Muscle"" and ""Osaka Metro"" to trend.
However, a spokesperson for the metro told The Japan Times, an English-language newspaper, that they had become aware of the errors when users got in touch with them directly.
As well as English, the website had been translated into Chinese, Korean and Thai. It's not known whether those sites contained errors as well, but they have all been taken down as a precaution.
The spokesperson did not say when the pages would be back online. For now, visitors to the English language page are automatically redirected to the main Japanese site.
But Osaka's metro is hardly alone - in fact, errors translating between Japanese and English are pretty common.
Earlier this year the singer Ariana Grande tried to get a Japanese tattoo on her wrist saying ""seven rings"", the name of her latest single. When she posted a photo online, fans pointed out that it actually said ""barbecue grill"".","Its English website, which has been taken offline, told people to take the 'Sakai muscle line'.",2019-03-19T10:20:39Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Translation errors force Osaka metro websites offline,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47622639,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11204/production/_106084107_gettyimages-635253938.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,force,1
Graeme McMillan,"People look for inspiration and happiness in a vast array of places. Some see school kids walking out of class across America to take a stand for gun control and find hope. Others note that 7-Eleven now has customizable tater tots and are filled with joy. What do they get when they look at the internet? All that and a lot of bickering and tweets about calzones. Here, dear friends, is what everyone was talking about online last week when they weren't talking about the new Avengers: Infinity War trailer. Rex-It What Happened: President Trump announced Rex Tillerson was being replaced as secretary of state on Twitter. What Really Happened: Folks like to make jokes about Donald Trump running America via Twitter, but last week he announced an executive decision on the platform that was definitely not funny—at least not to the head of the State Department. Yes, the change in Secretary of State—one of the most important, if not the most important, cabinet positions—was announced via social media, as if Trump was every parody of himself imaginable. For those who wanted more than just a tweet of notice about the new state of affairs, that was forthcoming … also via Twitter, of course. Those around Tillerson, who had just arrived back in the country, were surprised by the news, suggesting that Tillerson himself wasn’t entirely prepared for what had just happened. There might, it turns out, have been a reason for that, if one response from the State Department is to be believed. OK, perhaps it was a little disingenuous to say that no one saw this coming, as some pointed out. Unsurprisingly, the White House has a different take on the way everything went down. Except, it turned out, chief of staff John Kelly’s message might not have been entirely clear. There really is something to be said about Twitter’s role in all of this, isn’t there? Still, things couldn’t have been that bad, because Tillerson did make an appearance later that day to talk about his firing and smooth everything over. OK, maybe it was kinda bad. (Tillerson’s failure to thank the president did not go unnoticed by, well, anyone.) Still, perhaps the split between Trump and Tillerson was for the best. This is worth noting, as well. The State Department aide who put out the earlier statement saying that Tillerson didn’t know why he’d been fired? Yeah, there was a price to pay for saying that. The Takeaway: Quick, we need a catchy way of talking about former Exxon CEO Tillerson now that he’s been ousted! That'll do. Move Along, Nothing to See Here What Happened: House Republicans announced they were closing their investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, saying there was no evidence of such actions. What Really Happened: Last week, with little warning, the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election just... stopped. ""Case closed""? Sure, if you say so. And, it turns out, they really did say so. There are others who might disagree with that take, of course… As news of the surprise closure started to go wide, it was perhaps worth turning to the ranking Democrat on the committee to see if he had anything to say about the whole thing. That would be a yes, then. And, sure, it seems suspicious to say the least that the Republicans just shut down the investigation unfinished with so much still out there unanswered, but surely the Democrats on the committee were given adequate warning that the investigation was being closed, right? OK, but at least all the Republicans are agreed that this move was the smart one? Well, fine, yes, that’s a little awkward. Still, at least one of the leading Republicans on the committee didn’t disagree. Oh, come on. As the week continued, it eventually started to become clear even to the Republicans that this had been a mistake, with this headline putting it best: ""Republicans Fear They Botched Russia Report Rollout."" Gee, you think ? The Takeaway: In what could only be described as a spectacular piece of timing, the Republicans announced that there was nothing Russians had done in regards to the 2016 election in the same week that the Trump administration finally signed sanctions into law against 16 Russians for their efforts to interfere with the 2016 election. There’s nothing like being consistent. Meanwhile, Over at the Department of Justice... What Happened: Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation took aim at the Trump Organization. What Really Happened: Meanwhile, you might be thinking, “I wonder how special council Robert Mueller’s Russia collusion investigation is going? I’m sure that, if the House Republicans were right and there’s certainly nothing going on, he’ll be wrapping everything up too, right?” Funny story: He’s not wrapping everything up. Yes, in what is pretty much the opposite of wrapping things up, Mueller is subpoenaing the Trump Organization's records, which is … kind of a big deal, to say the least. Certainly, that’s what people on social media seemed to think. But what could it all mean? Some people had theories. And how is this going down with those targeted? Somewhere, Devin Nunes is wandering around the halls of Congress, muttering to himself, ""But I said nothing happened …!"" The Takeaway: It’s worth pointing out that the Mueller news dropped on March 15, which amused certain people online. Oh, Canada What Happened: Forget ""Commander in Chief,"" perhaps President Trump's title could be ""Gaslighter in Chief."" Or, maybe, ""Man Who Should Perhaps Never Talk in Front of a Tape Recorder Ever."" What Really Happened: This might sound like the kind of old-fashioned, unnecessary posturing of people stuck in the past, but once upon a time it was widely expected that the President of the United States wouldn't be the kind of person who would boast about lying to the head of state of a friendly nation. Those days, dear readers, are long gone. Yes, the Washington Post obtained audio from a fundraising speech in which Trump boasted that he’d made up information that he used in an argument with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over whether or not the US runs a trade deficit with Trudeau’s country. (It doesn't.) ""I had no idea,"" Trump can be heard to say on the tape. ""I just said, 'You’re wrong.' You know why? Because we’re so stupid."" As you might expect, people were thrilled about this display of, uh, political maneuvering? Sure, let’s go with that. As the media struggled to understand what was happening, the White House press secretary attempted to smooth out the situation by, well, repeating the lie. There is, also, a surreal second story to this audio of Trump that has nothing to do with lying to Justin Trudeau. Instead, it had to do with the ""bowling ball test."" As multiple outlets looked into the matter, it slowly emerged that it was probably all made up. Not to worry, though; according to the White House, it was just a joke. The Takeaway: There’s really only response to this entire exchange, isn’t there? Space Force? Space Force! What Happened: When it comes to America’s manifest destiny, there’s only one direction left to go: To infinity… and beyond? What Really Happened: With all the bad news going around the the White House, you can’t blame the president for wanting to change the narrative somehow. And you only get to do that, he knows, by thinking big and reaching for the stars. Last week, Trump gave a speech that showed just how literally he took that advice. Sure, going to Mars is definitely thinking big, but is it thinking big enough ? Not to worry, however; Trump was right there with the next big thing. Space Force! Just the very idea got the media excited, and asking questions like, “For real?” and “What does that even mean?”, not to mention “Do we have to?” Sure, not every outlet took the idea seriously, but that’s the lamestream media for you. Everyone else was into the idea, or calling the president a laughingstock. It’s hard to be a leader. But at least Twitter understood the potential of Space Force. SPACE FORCE ! The Takeaway: Make no mistake, people may joke now, but Space Force is the future.","Last week, President Trump advocated for a military corps \""like the Army and the Navy, but for space.\""",2018-03-18T13:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Trump's Call to Start a Space Force Tops This Week's Internet News Roundup,https://www.wired.com/story/internet-week-162/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5aac296b768d7859929e7354/191:100/pass/TrumpTillersonInternetWeek-932489700.jpg,wired,Wired,force,1
"John Kirby, CNN National Security Analyst","CNN national security analyst John Kirby, a retired rear admiral in the US Navy, was a spokesman for both the State and Defense departments in the Obama administration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to begin the process of establishing a new military branch, the Space Force. ""We must have American dominance in space,"" he said during a meeting of his National Space Council Monday. ""We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force: separate but equal. It is going to be something so important."" He's certainly right about that last part. It's important. Standing up a whole new military branch is no small thing, even in the easiest of times. And these aren't easy times right now. We've still got troops fighting throughout the Middle East and Afghanistan. We've got burgeoning tensions with China in the South China Sea. Our cyber infrastructure still gets attacked every day by hackers and foreign governments. And, despite the President's claim to the contrary, North Korea is still armed with nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them well beyond their borders. There's a lot going on. That doesn't mean exploring the development of a Space Force can't also be tackled. The Pentagon is certainly capable of accomplishing multiple tasks at once. And, with the largest defense budget ever enacted -- to the tune of $700 billion -- at his disposal, Defense Secretary James Mattis can't exactly argue he doesn't have the resources to take it on. But time, too, is a resource. So it's a fair question for military leaders to ask if standing up a new force really needs to be their priority right now... and if so, with what sense of urgency. There's already an Air Force Space Command and a Space and Missile Defense Center. And the Navy and Army both also boast space-related activities and facilities. As Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force's top officer, told members of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces just last month, ""Right now, as we make this transition from a benign to a warfighting environment... any move that actually ends up separating space as opposed to integrating space, I would argue is a move in the wrong direction."" Supporters of the new force -- especially Representatives Mike Rogers, R-Alabama, and Jim Cooper, D-Tennessee, chairman and ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee's strategic forces subcommittee -- argue that the United States is losing out to nations like Russia and China, which are advancing offensive and defensive space capabilities at an alarming rate. And they say now is exactly the right time to focus on organizational change. ""The bureaucracy is always going to fight reform -- always, especially the Pentagon,"" Rogers told NPR in an interview. ""They're fighting this because they don't want Congress meddling.... And they've got us in this situation now where Russia and China have become near peers. They're close to surpassing us. What we're proposing would change that."" Rogers makes a fair point. The threats posed to satellite security by potentially hostile states like Russia and China are real. Mattis' own national defense strategy says as much, labeling space a new ""warfighting domain."" And Rogers is right that the Pentagon tends to resist change. Nothing new there. Harry Truman fought turf battles of his own when he pushed through the National Security Act of 1947, which merged the Departments of War and Navy into a single Defense Department, created the office of the Secretary of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, and, wait for it... established the US Air Force as an independent military service. Navy admirals, in particular, pushed back on the potential that they could lose their air arm, and they bristled at the notion of losing a cabinet position. Fleet Admiral William F. ""Bull"" Halsey spoke for many of his fellow flag officers at the time when he told the new -- and first -- secretary of defense, James Forrestal, that he would only support ""the establishment of a single department of the armed forces if such establishment does not weaken the position of the US Navy in the scheme of things."" That caveat, ""in the scheme of things,"" was noteworthy. Having lost the unification fight, the Navy set its sights on preserving against the upstart Air Force that which it considered to be its unique strategic value to national defense: air- and sea-based nuclear deterrence. The ensuing food fights didn't make anyone look very good, and forced yet another round of unification legislation two years later with the National Security Act of 1949, which attempted to better clarify service roles and missions. But the die had been cast. And it's hard to imagine now, in retrospect, that Truman got it wrong by pushing both laws through. So, too, might Trump have it right. I share the concerns of military leaders about segregating out certain space missions that are perhaps better integrated into existing organizations. It's just not clear to me what problems a new Space Force is supposed to solve. And, if we've learned nothing else from 17 years of war, there is an undeniable logic to fostering jointness through shared responsibilities. But I also have to allow for the possibility that we might look back 10 years from now and wonder why we didn't have a Space Force sooner. Maybe space really is that unique a warfighting realm that it deserves its own people, command structure and resources. And maybe Air Force leaders will even come around to more publicly embrace the idea should some of their equities also be protected and preserved... you know, in the scheme of things. In any event, the President has made his decision. There is now, at the very least, clarity on his expectations. He should, as Truman did, take to the airwaves and byways to make his case directly to the American people and to the Congress, which must ultimately legislate the Space Force into being. Having lost the argument against the new force, Pentagon leaders must now develop the way forward. They must flesh out the President's vision. And, in this, they possess an advantage their early Cold War predecessors didn't necessarily have -- the chance to make of it what they will, free from rivalry and recrimination. They will be aided in that effort by their own Secretary of Defense, who, once adamantly opposed to the idea, seems to have warmed a wee bit. ""But to look now at the problem,"" Mattis said in late May, ""means we have to look afresh at it, and where are the specific problems, break them down, and if an organizational construct has to change, then I'm wide open to it."" He's giving himself and the Air Force a lot of flexibility there, a lot of different ways to meet the President's intent. Nothing wrong with that. The real question is, will they take advantage of this opportunity to appropriately shape the Space Force or will they squander it? Only time will tell. And time, too, is a resource. Mattis shouldn't waste it, nor should he rush it.","John Kirby writes that although there may be issues of timing and resources, Trump's desire to invest in the creation of a space force could pay dividends down the line.",2018-06-19T21:30:34Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",A space force?

MAGGIE HABERMAN,"In 2016, Mr. Miller began serving as a warm-up act for the president at his rallies, supplying a hypercharged, more polished version of Mr. Trumps immigration talk. Youve seen what it does to living standards, youve seen what it does to wages, you see what it does in terms of transnational cartels, Mr. Miller warned at a rally in Texas in June 2016. You have seen the heartbreak, you have seen the heartache, you have seen the needless death. Everybody everybody who is trying to stop Donald J. Trump wants that border to be wide open, he boomed, later asking, When did we forget that a country exists to serve its own citizens? A few days later, in Las Vegas, Mr. Miller asked the crowd, How does it help America or lift up America or support America to bring anyone into this country who rejects our values, rejects our way of living? Once inside the administration, Mr. Miller drew notice for declaring on a Sunday morning television program, after he and Stephen K. Bannon, then the chief strategist in the White House, had pushed through a travel ban targeting Muslim countries, that the presidents powers will not be questioned. To be sure, Mr. Miller is not the only person around Mr. Trump who has seen the immigration debate as having political value. With Mr. Trumps grip on his party tightening in the past year, he has pulled many Republicans toward his and Mr. Millers views on policies they might not have supported before, such as reductions to legal immigration. Other advisers saw the issue gaining traction beyond the Republican base in the years before the 2016 election, particularly in relation to the economy. A 2014 polling memo from Kellyanne Conway, now the counselor to the president, took note that deportations of unaccompanied children crossing the border had seized national attention.","As President Trump tries again to use immigration fears for electoral advantage, this time with control of Congress at stake, Mr. Miller, his chief policy adviser, is at his side.",2018-11-05T01:38:20Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",A Familiar Force Nurtures Trump’s Instincts on Immigration: Stephen Miller,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/us/politics/trump-stephen-miller-immigration.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/05/us/05dc-miller1/05dc-miller1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1
EMMA G. FITZSIMMONS,"The uncertainty over the fare increase highlights the growing dysfunction at the authority, which has increasingly been subject to the whims of Mr. Cuomo and his allies. For years, subway leaders had been planning to close the L train tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn to repair damage from Hurricane Sandy. Then Mr. Cuomo abruptly called off the shutdown this month.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has criticized the agency, complaining of its stodgy bureaucracy and saying he wants to blow up the M.T.A. The idea of calling off the fare increase something Mr. Cuomo has supported for months sounds good in theory. The subway is still far from reliable nearly two years after the system descended into crisis.
But the transit agencys financial plan relies on modest fare and toll increases, every two years, across its sprawling system of subways, buses, commuter railroads and paratransit service. The fare increase is expected to bring in an additional $316 million per year.
The authority is working to make reforms and improve service with its existing resources, said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority.
The M.T.A. board will have robust discussion and decide on the best course of action in the context of the M.T.A.s dire financial position, which requires fare and toll increases as well as new, sustainable, adequate sources of funding in order to balance the budget while avoiding painful service cuts, Mr. Tarek said in a statement.
The authoritys board has been considering two options for fare increases of about 4 percent: The first would keep the base fare at $2.75, but end the bonus for buying a pay-per-ride MetroCard; the second would increase the base fare to $3 and double the bonus to 10 percent. A weekly pass would rise to $33, up from $32. A monthly pass could increase to $127, up from $121.
Even with the fare increase, subway leaders say the system is in a grim financial situation. They have warned that without new revenue sources, their only options would be even higher fare increases or drastic cuts to subway and bus service. The agency expects to have a deficit of nearly $1 billion by 2022.","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo opposes raising fares for New York City’s subway and bus system, which transit officials say are needed to avoid major service cuts.",2019-01-23T08:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Cuomo’s Blunt Subway Strategy: Humiliate the M.T.A. to Force Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/nyregion/cuomo-mta-fare-increase.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/nyregion/23mta/23mta-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1
DAVID E. SANGER and GARDINER HARRIS,"Over the longer term, they must straighten out the strategic incoherence surrounding Mr. Trump’s approach to Russia and China, defining the meaning of the administration’s policy declaration earlier this year that “great power competition — not terrorism — is now the primary focus of U.S. national security.” Washington is now consumed by a debate over whether Mr. Trump’s new team plans to govern as far to the right as it talks. So far, the incoming national security adviser, John R. Bolton, has declared that his past comments are “behind me.” Hours after his selection was announced, Mr. Bolton vowed that he would find ways to execute the policies that Mr. Trump was elected on, but that he would not tolerate slow-walking and leaks from bureaucrats he dismissed as “munchkins.” Some who know Mr. Bolton and his operating style predict titanic clashes. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, the retired general who has argued for keeping the Iran deal intact and warned that military confrontation with North Korea would result in “the worst kind of fighting in most people’s lifetimes,” told colleagues on Friday that he did not know if he could work with Mr. Bolton. The White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, another retired four-star general, was also unenthusiastic about Mr. Bolton’s hiring. Photo President Trump with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Vice President Mike Pence and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Friday. Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times Mr. Bolton’s harshest critics — mostly Democrats, but their ranks include some members of the Bush administration — argue that the odds of taking military action will rise dramatically when he becomes the last person a volatile American president consults. “John Bolton is not some gray bureaucrat whose views are unknown to us,” said Michael McFaul, the American ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama, and now a Stanford professor and the director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. “He’s very clear that there should be regime change in Iran and North Korea, and military force should be used to achieve those goals,” Mr. McFaul said. “If you hire him, you’re making a clear signal that’s what you want.” But others who have worked for years with Mr. Bolton argue that Mr. Trump knows exactly what he is getting: leverage, not conflict. “I think this notion everybody talks about, that the risks of war have gone up, is wrong,” said Stephen J. Hadley, who was Mr. Bush’s national security adviser and a major architect of the invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. “This is the peace-through-strength crowd who want to make clear to people that they’re tough and that no one should cross them. But the reason for that is to deter war.” Dov Zakheim, a former senior Defense Department official who has known Mr. Bolton for 35 years, wrote on Friday that Mr. Bolton “may be a fire breather, but he is a man who cares deeply about his country,” in comparison to his boss, who “cares deeply about Donald Trump.” Whatever Mr. Trump’s motives, his selection of this team would have been hard to imagine when he first came to office declaring that the continued American presence in Iraq was a “disaster,” that he was comfortable with Japan and South Korea getting their own nuclear weapons so the United States would not have to defend them, and that America would no longer be the world’s policeman. Mr. Bolton has come to the opposite conclusion. He not only fervently advocated the attack on Saddam Hussein from his post at the State Department during the Bush administration, but he also defended its aftermath, and has said he remains convinced it was the right decision. Over the past three years, Mr. Bolton has advocated bombing Iran, attacking North Korea, and carving a new state out of Iraq and Syria. Mike Pompeo, the nominee for secretary of state, said at the Aspen Security Conference in July that the most dangerous thing about North Korea was the fact that its young, moody and reportedly ruthless leader, Kim Jong-un, controls its weapons. “So from the administration’s perspective, the most important thing we can do is separate those two. Right?” said Mr. Pompeo, who at the time was months into his current job as C.I.A. director. “Separate capacity and someone who might well have intent, and break those two apart.” Assuming that Mr. Pompeo is confirmed, he and Mr. Bolton, the two most forceful, aggressive new members of the policy team, will have to decide in what order they can risk those confrontations. The Trump administration has said it is open to direct talks with Mr. Kim by May — the same month by which the president has said he will scrap the Iran nuclear accord. “Even if you are going to be a superhawk, you can’t do all these at once,” said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former C.I.A. station chief in Moscow who later hunted down Pakistani nuclear technology as the Energy Department’s chief intelligence officer. “And if you want to go to war with Iran and North Korea, you have to expect to alienate your allies and run headlong into the Russians.” William J. Burns, a longtime American diplomat who was Mr. Bush’s ambassador to Russia and Mr. Obama’s deputy secretary of state, predicted that if the new team exits the Iran deal and confronts North Korea, the first beneficiary is likely to be President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “He looks for splits,” Mr. Burns said of Mr. Putin. “He knows he will benefit if we walk away from the Iran deal, because it will put a wedge between us and our European allies.” On North Korea, Mr. Burns said, Mr. Putin is seeking “splits between the U.S. and China. We are doing his work for him.” In fact, it is in dealing with Mr. Putin that the new team is likely to run headlong into Mr. Trump’s reluctance to ever say a critical word about the Russian president. As C.I.A. chief, Mr. Pompeo has embraced the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia meddled in the election, though he changes the subject quickly when asked about it. Mr. Bolton, by contrast, has ranked among Mr. Putin’s harshest critics. Last July, days after Mr. Trump met Mr. Putin for the first time at a summit meeting in Germany, Mr. Bolton wrote that the Russian interference in the 2016 election was “a casus belli, a true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate.” Mr. Trump did not view it that way. He emerged from the meeting in Germany repeating Mr. Putin’s observation that the Russians were too skilled at cyberoperations to be caught if involved. Last week, Mr. Trump called Mr. Putin to congratulate him on winning a Russian election widely viewed as a sham, making no mention of the recent nerve-agent attack that Britain concluded, with American agreement, was a covert action by Moscow. If it was, it was being planned out as Mr. Pompeo was acting as the host to the directors of the three major Russian intelligence services in Washington earlier this month. The unknown factor in the new mix is Gina Haspel, the career intelligence officer who has been nominated to be the first woman to run the C.I.A. Since she has spent much of her career undercover — details of which the agency is just beginning to release, in an effort to lobby for her confirmation — her foreign policy views are largely unknown. Photo Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, who has been nominated as secretary of state, is a harsh critic of the nuclear accord with Iran. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times But her record in the terrorist detentions and interrogations following 9/11 is well documented. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who was tortured as a prisoner of war, this past week pointedly asked in a letter to Ms. Haspel, “Do you believe actions like these were justified, and do you believe they produced actionable intelligence?” At a moment when Mr. Trump has sided with the economic nationalists in his administration and ordered the imposition of tariffs on China to counter its restrictions on American companies and the forced transfer of American intellectual property, Mr. Bolton has gone one further. He has questioned whether the United States should abandon the “One China” policy that has been the underpinning of relations since the two countries resumed diplomatic relations. In 2016, Mr. Bolton wrote that confronting China “may involve modifying or even jettisoning the ambiguous ‘One China’ mantra, along with even more far-reaching initiatives to counter Beijing’s rapidly accelerating political and military aggressiveness in the South and East China Seas.” It is unclear how that squares with Mr. Trump’s campaign argument that the United States should pull its forces back from Asia unless South Korea and Japan pay more of the cost of keeping them there. But the most immediate decision facing the new team will be the benefits and costs of exiting the Iran deal. Mr. Trump cited his differences with Rex W. Tillerson on Iran in firing the secretary of state. Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo have been among the harshest critics of the nuclear accord, but they have not said how they would manage the international backlash if Mr. Trump decides, by a May 12 legislative deadline, to resume the sanctions that the United States suspended when the deal was reached. If Washington breaches the deal, Iran may declare it is now free to resume producing nuclear fuel in unlimited quantities — limits it agreed to, for 15 years, in return for economic normalization. If so, that could put the United States and Israel back where they were in the years before the accord was reached: threatening military action to destroy Iran’s facilities, even at the risk of another Middle East war. That was the path Mr. Bolton advocated. In August, when Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis wrote a joint op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal describing the merits of building economic pressure on North Korea in a policy of “strategic accountability,” Mr. Bolton said he was “appalled.” “Time is not a neutral factor here,” he said on Fox News, where he was a contributor. “More negotiation with North Korea? I think they’d say ‘bring it on.’ More time to increase the size and scope of their ballistic missile and nuclear capabilities.” He will now be preparing Mr. Trump for that negotiation.

LEONARD MLODINOW,"But to me Stephen was also the everyday miracle of an ordinary embodied human — albeit one who had to battle in heroic ways within the confines of his particular shell. What you don’t often hear about Stephen is that he loved a good curry, but not if it was spicy. That he considered himself allergic to gluten, but that he wouldn’t notice when his caregivers occasionally let some slip through. That he ate bananas mashed with kiwi every day. That he had to eat all his food mashed or chopped, and had to be spoon-fed. And that he never let this embarrass him, even when he ate in the finest restaurants. I began collaborating with Stephen in the early 2000s, not long after I had published my first book. He contacted me to ask if I’d consider working with him on a book — the first of two we would write together. Though I was also a physicist, and had had the good fortune to work alongside other geniuses of the field like Richard Feynman, I was no less awe-struck by the chance to get to know Stephen. Soon we were collaborating, literally elbow-to-elbow, many hours each day, for days on end. We would talk and debate about physics, and about how best to write about it. But I was also helping to dab his face dry, adjust his glasses, carry him to the couch. And then we’d get back to arguing. With time, our intellectual connection was deepened by that physical intimacy, and we grew close. Since Stephen couldn’t speak, he communicated through his computer. Composing a sentence was like playing a video game — the cursor would move on the screen, and he would have to capture the letter or word he wanted by pressing on a mouse with his thumb, or, in his later years, moving his cheek to activate a motion sensor in his glasses. When he was done, he would click an icon and his famous computer voice would read what he had typed out. Stephen could compose his sentences at a rate of only about six words a minute. At first I would sit impatiently, daydreaming on and off as I waited for him to finish his composition. But then one day I was looking over his shoulder at his computer screen, where the sentence he was constructing was visible, and I started thinking about his evolving reply. By the time he had completed it, I had had several minutes to ponder the ideas he was expressing. This was a great help. It allowed me to more profoundly consider his remarks, and it enabled my own ideas, and my reactions to his, to percolate as they never could have in an ordinary conversation. When I argued a point of physics with Stephen, I always lost. I would scribble equations on a pad or a whiteboard, trying to sway him, but when I was done, I would find that the answer was the one he had already worked out in his head. He was no less certain in his ideas about how to write our books, though when we disagreed on those matters, there was no right or wrong answer, only preference. And so we might argue at length — on one occasion we did so for two hours — over a single sentence. There was an important difference between us here. Making my arguments took little effort. To oppose my ideas, Stephen had to struggle to type every letter of every word. Yet it was I, not he, who ceded points out of exhaustion. Once, during a particularly heated discussion, I waited several minutes for him to respond, and then, when his response finally came, it was a joke. Even when contemplating the cosmic, he had a keen sense of the comic. Stephen’s expertise was gravitation, the weakest of the four fundamental forces of the universe. Yet Stephen himself was a strong force. When, as a student, he started his work on black holes, most scientists thought it was a dead-end field. His doctors made a similar assessment regarding his prospects in life. Proving people wrong turned out to be his strength — and his gift to all of us.

ROBERT D. McFADDEN,"But there was a hidden side to Mrs. Chennault’s affairs, historians say. She was known to have been a conduit for Nationalist Chinese funds for the Republican Party, and to have been a secret go-between for American officials and Asian leaders like Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist Chinese generalissimo, and President Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam. And in a contretemps of international intrigue and presidential politics that generated heated debate for years, Mrs. Chennault was recorded on an F.B.I. wiretap helping to sabotage a peace initiative during the Vietnam War in order to promote Nixon’s victory over Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey in the 1968 presidential election. Soon after President Lyndon B. Johnson announced a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam to ease the way for Paris peace talks that fall, Mrs. Chennault, a behind-the-scenes liaison for Nixon’s campaign and the Saigon government, was overheard urging South Vietnamese officials to boycott the Paris peace talks, saying they would get a better deal from a Nixon administration if they waited until after the election. That same day, Nov. 2, President Thieu announced that his government would not join the Paris talks. Three days later, Nixon was elected. President Johnson was furious when he learned of Mrs. Chennault’s intervention, and considered having her charged under federal statutes with criminally interfering with the conduct of foreign affairs. She was never prosecuted. Nixon lifted the tap on her telephones and awarded her Flying Tiger Line a lucrative Pacific cargo route. But for a supporter who had provided vital Asian contacts and $240,000 in contributions to the Nixon campaign, Mrs. Chennault received no major appointment in his administration, as she had hoped. In her 1980 memoir, “The Education of Anna,” she denied involvement in the peace talk maneuvers but acknowledged her disappointment with Nixon. “The ultimate handshake came months later, at a White House function, when Nixon took me aside and, with intense gratitude, began thanking me for my help in the election,” she wrote. Photo Mrs. Chennault with President Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger in an undated photograph. Credit Schlesinger Library/Radcliffe Institute “ ‘I’ve certainly paid dearly for it,’ I pointed out. “ ‘Yes, I appreciate that,’ he murmured, suddenly uncomfortable. ‘I know you are a good soldier.’ ” Anna Chennault was born Chen Xiangmei in Beijing on June 23, either in 1923 or 1925, one of six daughters of P. Y. and Isabelle Liao Chen, members of a prosperous family of diplomats and scholars. Her father taught law at the University of Peking and was editor of the English-language New China Morning Post. She and her sisters grew up in a mansion near the Forbidden City with an entourage of servants and tutors. As Japanese invaders approached Beijing in 1937, her family fled to Hong Kong. Her father became an envoy to Mexico, her mother died, and Anna and her sisters became scattered refugees in occupied China, with family jewels sewn into coat linings. Despite the war, she studied journalism with refugee professors and earned a degree from Lingnan University in 1944. Fluent in Chinese dialects and English, she became a correspondent for China’s Central News Agency, covering the war and later Mao Zedong’s spreading Communist revolution. She met General Chennault in Kunming. He was three decades older, a married father of eight and the hero of the Flying Tigers, who shot down hundreds of Japanese warplanes and kept China’s hopes alive during the war. In 1947, after his divorce, they were married in Shanghai. Besides Cynthia, they had another daughter, Claire, who also survives her, as do three sisters, Cynthia Lee, Sylvia Wong and Loretta Fung; and two grandsons. The Chennaults lived in Shanghai, San Francisco, the general’s hometown, Monroe, La., and Taipei, where they ran the Flying Tiger Line and the Civil Air Transport, which was later owned by the Central Intelligence Agency and used in covert anti-Communist operations. General Chennault died of lung cancer in 1958 at 67, and Mrs. Chennault moved to Washington. She was soon embraced by her husband’s friends, including Thomas G. Corcoran, a New Deal strategist who became a notable Washington lobbyist for corporations and foreign powers. He showed her the ropes of lobbying, and she dedicated her memoir to him, calling him “the best teacher of them all.” In Washington Mrs. Chennault joined the Republican Party and right-wing cadres of influential Americans supporting Taiwan and opposing Communist China. In 1962, with President Kennedy’s blessing, she founded Chinese Refugees’ Relief, which assisted thousands fleeing China. She testified in Congress, wrote articles, gave speeches and, from 1963 to 1966, made weekly broadcasts in Chinese on the Voice of America radio. In a penthouse apartment resembling a James Bond movie set overlooking the Potomac, she entertained 80 to 100 people a week, serving concoctions like “concubine’s delight” (chicken/snow peas) and “negotiator’s soup” (for Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger). At her soirees, Mrs. Chennault, less than 5 feet tall, cut a striking figure in slim Chinese dresses and spike-heeled satin shoes. Her aura of intrigue was only enhanced by evasive replies to reporters’ questions about possible C.I.A. connections and her frequent travels to Asian countries embroiled in Cold War conflicts. “Mrs. Chennault — or the Dragon Lady, as she is called by her enemies — is well-known around Washington as a Vietnam hawk,” The New York Times Magazine said in 1970. She chided Nixon for what she called his cautious prosecution of the Vietnam War. “He should have gone ahead and done what had to be done — clean it all out, go the whole way,” she told Parade magazine. Her image as an implacable anti-Communist was eased in 1981 when she visited Beijing and Taipei for talks with Deng Xiaoping, China’s leader, and President Chiang Ching-kuo of Taiwan. Acknowledging that her views had softened, she said people must be “humble enough to learn, courageous enough sometimes to change their positions.” By then, her causes had all been lost. The Vietnam War was over, Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong were dead, and the United States had severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and recognized the People’s Republic of China. Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.

KAREN CROUSE,"I didnt want to get run over, Woods said later with a laugh. Most of the day, he followed his longtime routine, blocking out any fuss from the gallery, fixing a steely stare forward and marching toward the hole. That focus has always been part of his strength. But on Sunday, almost everything felt different, even as Woods regained a big piece of his past. The fans at East Lake threw their voices behind him with a fervor that came across as much more affectionate than the You da Man support he received when he was clinically destroying fields. Terry Bradley, who drove from Louisville, Ky., with his wife, Rachel, to follow Woods over the weekend, said he had heard fans shouting encouragement like Cmon, kid, as if Woods had shed years, and not just rust, since returning to competition. I thought about it, and its the comeback story, Bradley said. Because nobody thought he would make it back to this level. And the way hes been humbled. Hes human. Woods had been troubled over the last decade not just by injuries, but also by embarrassing revelations about his sex life that led to divorce, caused sponsors to flee and smudged the clean-cut image he had cultivated even before he left Stanford to turn professional. He kept winning, though, racking up five victories in 2013 before his back failed him. Roughly a month after his fourth operation, a spinal fusion, Woods was arrested on a charge of driving under the influence near his Florida home. The toxicology reports found five drugs in his system, including two powerful painkillers and sleep-inducing medication. Woods sought inpatient addiction treatment after that episode.","Four back operations derailed Woods’s career, but he returned to the PGA Tour this season and at 42 staged one of the more remarkable comebacks in sports history, winning the Tour Championship.",2018-09-24T03:15:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Tiger Woods, Golf’s Dominant Force, Hoists a Trophy Once Again",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/23/sports/golf/tiger-woods-wins-pga-tour.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/sports/24golf-live-tigerwins-wide/24golf-live-tigerwins-wide-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1
George Dvorsky,"Speaking at the Pentagon earlier today, Vice President Mike Pence outlined the official plan to create the U.S. Space Force, the first new branch of the military in more than 70 years. Describing it as “an idea whose time has come,” Pence told an audience of U.S. Armed Forces that the Space Force—the first new military branch since the establishment of the U.S. Air Force in 1947—will restore American leadership in space. Pence provided some new details about the Space Force and his administration’s plan for rolling out the new branch, which he expects to be up-and-running by 2020. Later today, the Pentagon will be releasing a congressionally mandated report describing the steps needed to create the new branch. Quoting President Trump, Pence said American adversaries have transformed space into a warfighting domain, “just like land, air, and sea,” requiring the U.S. to create a new military service, the nation’s sixth, dedicated to protecting its interests and assets in space. “What was once peaceful and uncontested is now crowded and adversarial,” said Pence. “Other countries now threaten U.S. space assets as never before,” developing technologies that can “jam, blind, and disable communications satellites from the ground.” As Pence made clear, those “other countries” are Russia and China. Pence described a 2007 test, for example, in which China used a missile to destroy a defunct weather satellite, a demonstration he described as “highly provocative.” He talked about sophisticated in-orbit technologies being developed by both China and Russia that could be used to disable U.S. satellites, including laser-based technologies. China, he said, is investing heavily in hypersonic missiles capable of evading U.S. detection; the VP mentioned of China’s first hypersonic aircraft, which underwent its first successful test last week. He also warned that China and Russia are integrating anti-satellite attacks into their wartime doctrines. “As their actions make clear, our adversaries have transformed space into a warfighting domain already, and the U.S. will not shrink from this challenge,” said Pence. “We will meet it head on. America will always seek peace—but peace only comes through strength.” Pence, who said the new branch will be equal to the five other branches, outlined four actions required to “evolve the space capabilities” of the U.S. military. A new unified command structure will be created, called U.S. Space Command, that will be led by a four-star general to ensure integration across the other branches and domains. It will develop new tactics and procedures specific to space, among other responsibilities. The new Space Force will also see the creation of “an elite group of warfighters specializing in space,” Pence said, forming the “backbone of the newest armed service.” This new Space Operations Force will draw men and women from across the military, he said, and grow into its own unique and cohesive community. A new joint organization, the Space Development Agency, will be tasked with developing cutting-edge warfighting capabilities for the physical domain of space. “Bold breakthroughs” in technologies are required, said Pence, which need to be developed “faster than U.S. adversaries.” Finally, the new Space Force will require a new Assistant Secretary for the Defense of Space, who will report directly to the Secretary of Defense. This civilian appointment will need to maintain responsibility and accountability within the branch, and will help to transition elements of the military into the space-based force, said Pence. The Space Force could be operational by 2020, said Pence, but he said “Congress must act.” The 2019 federal budget, scheduled for February, will include a wish-list specific to the needs of the new branch. “The time has come to write the next great chapter in our Armed Forces,” Pence declared. “It’s time to establish the United States Space Force.” The Trump administration is moving ahead with its plans to create this new branch, despite of complaints that it’ll contribute to new bureaucratic burdens, costs, and a mass reorganization of America’s military assets. What’s more, the U.S. Air Force is now likely to be stripped of many of its current space-oriented responsibilities. Regardless, it’s happening, and as Pence pointed out, so too is the next chapter in world military history.","Speaking at the Pentagon earlier today, Vice President Mike Pence outlined the official plan to create the U.S. Space Force, the first new branch of the military in more than 70 years.

SpaceX has consistently claimed that its Falcon 9 rocket worked perfectly—a claim with added credence, now that the U.S. Air Force has said it’s not going to dismiss the rocket company’s right to vie for military contracts. Everything seemed to go fine during the January 7 launch, with initial reports suggesting Zuma made it successfully to low Earth orbit. But in the days that followed it became clear that something had gone wrong, with the spy satellite being declared a “ total loss.” Contradictory accounts are emerging in the wake of the apparent failure of the Zuma mission—a… Read more Read This multibillion-dollar mission remains classified, so information is hard to come by. U.S. lawmakers have been briefed about the loss of the satellite, but virtually nothing has been disclosed to the public. In an emailed statement to Gizmodo, SpaceX said: For clarity: after review of all data to date, Falcon 9 did everything correctly on [January 7]. If we or others find otherwise based on further review, we will report it immediately. Information published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false. Due to the classified nature of the payload, no further comment is possible. Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman—the company contracted out by the U.S. Air Force to provide the payload adapter—refused to say anything at all, citing the classified nature of the mission. Now, as Bloomberg reports, the U.S. Air Force has shown great confidence in SpaceX, telling the news outlet that the Falcon 9 rocket “did everything correctly,” and that, “based on the data available, our team did not identify any information that would change SpaceX’s Falcon 9 certification status” following “a preliminary review of telemetry that was available to us from” the launch. That said, Air Force officials said they’ll continue to “evaluate data from all launches.” This is obviously great news for Elon Musk, whose company was certified by the Air Force in 2015 to compete alongside United Launch Alliance/Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corporation for military contracts. SpaceX remains eligible to bid for 11 launches from now till the end of the 2019 fiscal year. But while the U.S. Air Force’s vote of confidence looks good for SpaceX, it doesn’t look so hot for Northrop Grumman. Suspicions that the company’s payload adapter—a device that physically separates the satellite from the upper part of the rocket during deployment—is the part that failed now seem more plausible. Normally, SpaceX provides a payload adapter, but Zuma planners insisted on a device manufactured by the defense firm. All this said, we still don’t know what happened. Maybe the satellite failed to power up at separation, or it accidentally put itself in an orbit that sent it hurtling towards Earth. Or the conspiracy theorists are right, and Zuma is alive and well.

ALAN FEUER,"The whole thing might have been dismissed as just another publicity stunt from Mr. Avenatti, who has a penchant for making provocative statements about Mr. Trump and who has even mused about running for president in 2020. But now that Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty, he may no longer be able — or choose — to avail himself of the Fifth Amendment’s safeguards. Because of that development, Mr. Avenatti vowed last week to ask the judge to lift the stay and to let him question Mr. Trump about Ms. Clifford by taking his deposition. “The developments of today will permit us to have the stay lifted in the civil case &amp; should also permit us to proceed with an expedited deposition of Trump under oath about what he knew, when he knew it, and what he did about it,” Mr. Avenatti wrote on Twitter on the day that Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty. “We will disclose it all to the public.” The legal maneuver arguably remains something of a longshot for Mr. Avenatti. Still, if he is eventually permitted to depose Mr. Trump, he could direct his inquiries toward several unanswered questions that have lingered at the heart of the hush-money arrangement: Was Mr. Cohen indeed reimbursed, as prosecutors claim, by the Trump Organization? Which executives there were involved in the transaction? Was the payment made, as Mr. Cohen noted in his guilty plea, to influence the election? The non-disclosure agreement silencing Ms. Clifford was dated Oct. 28, 2016, and was meant to be signed by four people: her first lawyer, Keith Davidson; Mr. Cohen; Ms. Clifford herself (who was identified as “Peggy Peterson”); and Mr. Trump (who was identified as “David Dennison.”) While it may be curious that Mr. Trump never signed the deal, the omission squares with his latest explanation for his role in the imbroglio. After denying for months that he slept with — or paid — Ms. Clifford, the president said last week that even though he was the source of the money, Mr. Cohen struck the deal without his knowledge and that he learned about it only after it was inked.","The argument by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film star known as Stormy Daniels, hinges on a blank signature line above the alias used for Donald J.

Issie Lapowsky,"Its 8 on a Wednesday morning in January, and David Carrolls Brooklyn apartment, a sunny, wood-beamed beauty converted from an old sandpaper factory, is buzzing.
His 10-year-old daughter, dressed in polka-dot pants, dips out the front door and off to school, Jansport backpack slung over her shoulders. His 5-year-old son darts into the living room in a luchador mask he picked up on the familys holiday trip to Mexico. (His wrestling name, he tells me, is Diablo.) Carrolls wife, Alex, who was unaware a reporter was coming to interview her husband this morning, hurries around picking up the detritus any family of four might leave behind in the morning rush and tucking away product samples from her job as a market researcher. Theres a crayon drawing on the coffee table, an intricate toy camping scene set up on the floor. And on the refrigerator, someoneI suspect the boyhas spelled out the word POOP in multicolored alphabet magnets.
For most everyone in Carrolls bustling household, today is a morning like any other. Not for Carroll. This morning, he rolled out of bed at 6 am to news that the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, the now defunct international conglomerate, had pled guilty to criminal charges of disobeying a British data regulator.
The story of how the data analytics firm and former Trump campaign consultant misappropriated the Facebook data of tens of millions of Americans before the 2016 election is by now well known. But the companys guilty plea wasnt really about all those headlines youve seen splattered in the news over the past year. Instead, their crime was defying a government order to hand over all of the data they had ever collected on just one person: David Carroll.
For more than two years, Carroll, a professor of media design at The New School in Manhattan, has been on an obsessive, epically nerdy, and ultimately valuable quest to retrieve his data from Cambridge Analytica. During the 2016 election, when the firm worked for both the Trump campaign and senator Ted Cruzs campaign, its leaders bragged openly about having collected thousands of data points to build detailed personality profiles on every adult in the United States. They said they used these profiles to target people with more persuasive ads, and when President Trump won the White House, they hungrily accepted credit.
A year ago, Carroll filed a legal claim against the London-based conglomerate, demanding to see what was in his profile. Because, with few exceptions, British data protection laws allow people to request data on them thats been processed in the UK, Carroll believed that even as an American, he had a right to that information. He just had to prove it.
Carroll shuffles past me barefoot, a mug of coffee in one hand, his phone in the other. Enjoy the moment, he says, reading a message from his lawyer, Ravi Naik, whos been feeding him updates from London all morning. About an hour later, an email floats into Carrolls inbox from the British Information Commissioners Office, the regulator that brought the charges. Carroll turns his phone toward me to reveal the news. Cambridge Analyticas parent company, SCL, is being fined the equivalent of roughly $27,000. Carrolls cut? About $222.
He couldnt help but laugh. The sum is insignificant. The moment, anything but.
When he started out, Carroll was an underdog, facing off against a corporation with ties to the president of the United States and backed by billionaire donor Robert Mercer. If he lost, Carroll would be on the hook for the opposing teams legal fees, which he wasnt quite sure how hed pay.
But if he won, Carroll believed he could prove an invaluable point. He could use that trove of information he received to show the world just how powerless Americans are over their privacy. He could offer up a concrete example of how one mans informationhis supermarket punch card, his online shopping habits, his voting patternscan be bought and sold and weaponized by corporations and even foreign entities trying to influence elections.
But more importantly, he could show whats possible in countries like the UK where people actually have the right to reclaim some of that power. He could prove why people in the United States, who have no such rights, deserve those same protections.
Much has changed since David Carroll picked this fight with Goliath. Following a relentless flood of scandals last spring, SCL shuttered and is now going through insolvency proceedings in the UK. The Cambridge Analytica scandal spurred just the kind of privacy awakening in the US that Carroll was seeking. Facebook tightened its hold on user data and has been increasingly asked to answer for all the ways it gave that data away in the first place. A strict data protection law passed unanimously in California last summer, and members of Congress have begun floating plans for broader federal privacy legislation.
Carroll, meanwhile, has emerged as a cult hero of privacy hawks, who follow every turn in his case, Twitter fingers itching. This week, hell become a movie star, appearing as a central character in a feature-length documentary called The Great Hack, premiering at the Sundance Film Festival. We hope this film sheds light on what it means to sign the terms and conditions that we agree to every day, the filmmakers, Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer, explained in an email. What does it mean when we actually become a commodity being mined?
But for all thats changed during these past two years, so much has stayed the same. Despite SCLs guilty plea, Carroll still hasnt gotten his data. And Americans today have no more legal rights to privacy than they did when Carrolls crusade began two years ago. That could change this year. With a strict data protection law set to go into effect in California next January, even tech giants have begun pushing for federal regulation that would set rules for businesses across the country. Now more than ever, Carroll says, having that information in hand could help illustrate exactly how this new economyso often misunderstood and discussed in the abstractworks. Which is why, nearly a year after the Cambridge Analytica story broke, and many months after its name has fallen out of the daily headlines, Carroll keeps fighting.
If you know Carroll from Twitterwhere, as @profcarroll, he spends his days tweeting bombastically about Facebooks duplicity or stridently skewering obscure figures from the Trump campaign in long, snarky, and inscrutable threadsthen you couldnt possibly imagine the nervous, affable guy I first met in a downtown Manhattan coffee shop back in 2017.
He looked exactly the way I expected a tenured liberal arts professor to look: gray stubble on his face, a disarming smile. I could easily imagine him in tweed. It was November 8, a year to the day since Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. That evening, Carroll sat across the table from me, a lit tea light casting his face in a film noir glow, and told me what he knew so far of his story.
Carroll hadnt always been in academia. During the dotcom boom and bust, he worked in digital marketing and watched as advertising evolved from the sort of broad branding exercise that had been the dominion of television and print to an industry dominated by Google, which used infinite quantities of user data to hyper-target ads. When he left his marketing career to teach full time, Carroll, who has an MFA in design and technology, transformed from an industry participant to a chief critic, lecturing students on what he calls the myth that advertising doesnt work if its not targeted.
When Carroll picked his fight with Cambridge Analytica, he worried about putting himself and his family at risk. In the UK, whoever loses a legal suit has to pay the other sides fees. Carroll raised more than $40,000 on CrowdJustice to form his own legal defense fund.
In 2014, while he was on sabbatical, Carroll began working on a startup called Glossy, which integrated with Facebook to recommend articles from magazine archives based on users interests. The idea never took off; Carroll couldnt get funding, and his early employees got quickly poached by tech giants. But he got just far enough to see how much user data Facebook was willing to give away in the name of growth. At the time, the social networking giant allowed developers to slurp up data not just from their own users but from their users friends, all without their friends awareness or explicit consent. Facebook didn't officially end this policy until April 2015, and continued to give some developers access even after that.
I saw how the sausage got made and how easy it was to amass data and create a surveillance infrastructure, Carroll says.
Around that same time, across the Atlantic Ocean, another young professor at the University of Cambridge named Aleksandr Kogan was building an app of his own. It used a personality quiz to collect users profile information, including their location, gender, name, and Page likes, and then spit out predictions about their personality types. Like Carroll, Kogan knew that when Facebook users took the quizzes, not only would their data be free for the taking, so would the data belonging to millions of their friends. Unlike Carroll, Kogan viewed that not as an invasion of privacy but as an opportunity.
It didnt even dawn on us that people could react this way, Kogan says.
Beginning in 2014, Kogan paid about 270,000 US Facebook users to take the quiz, which Kogan has said unlocked access to some 30 million peoples data. But Kogan wasnt just working on his own. He was collecting this information on behalf of SCL, which had big plans to use it to influence American elections. Kogan sold the data and his predictions to the company, and though he didnt know it then, lit the fuse of a time bomb that would detonate three years down the line.
Carroll knew none of this at the time. But his experience building Glossy made him enough of a self-proclaimed privacy nerd that by the time the 2016 election rolled around he was keeping a close eye on the presidential campaigns and their digital strategies. He was watching SCLs spinoff Cambridge Analytica, in particular, because it had taken credit for helping senator Ted Cruz win the Iowa primary, using so-called psychographic targeting techniques. But it wasnt until President Trumps upset victory, in a campaign that had been buoyed by Cambridge Analytica data scientists and consultants, that Carroll, a Democrat, began to worry about what this firm could really do with millions of Americans information.
He wasnt the only one. Thousands of miles away, in Geneva, Switzerland, a researcher named Paul-Olivier Dehaye, who now runs a digital rights nonprofit called PersonalData.IO, was deep into a months-long investigation of SCL. At the time, he was trying to answer a fundamental question about the company that was also rumored to have played a hand in promoting the Brexit referendum: Did Cambridge Analytica really know as much as it claimed? Or was it just selling snake oil? One way to answer that question conclusively, Dehaye believed, would be to see what information the company actually held.
The UKs Data Protection Act guarantees the right to access data thats processed within the UK. But in the past, it was mainly British residents who had exercised that right. Few had ever tested whether the law applied to people outside of the country as well. Dehaye believed this would be the perfect opportunity to try, so he began reaching out to American academics, activists, and journalists, urging them to submit what is known as a subject access request to the company. It was Americans data, after all, that Cambridge Analytica seemed most interested in. Carroll was one of Dehayes targets.
David was very vocal on Twitter, and he already knew a lot about ad tech, Dehaye says. Thats why I thought I had a chance to convince him.
He was right. Carroll was one of a handful of people who accepted the challenge. He says he viewed the project as an academic experiment at first, and, he says, a good use of his tenure. I cant get fired for what I do, he said. My job gives me the freedom to pursue these things. If I dont do it, whos going to?
In early 2017, Carroll submitted his request, along with a copy of his drivers license, his electric bill, and a £10 fee, which Dehaye paid. Then he waited. Dehaye never really expected Carroll to receive a response. In fact the story may have ended there, had SCL denied that Carroll had the right to his data from the outset. They could have just said UK law doesnt apply to you because youre an American, Dehaye says.
Instead, one Monday morning about a month later, as Carroll sat alone in his apartment, sipping coffee at the dining room table, an email landed in his inbox from the data compliance team at SCL Group. It included a letter signed by the companys chief operating officer, Julian Wheatland, and an Excel file laying out in neatly arranged rows and columns exactly who Carroll iswhere he lives, how hes voted, and, most interestingly to Carroll, how much he cares about issues like the national debt, immigration, and gun rights, on a scale of one to 10. Carroll had no way of knowing what information informed those rankings; the thousands of data points Cambridge Analytica supposedly used to build these predictions were nowhere to be found.
I felt very invaded personally, but then I also saw it was such a public interest issue, Carroll says.
He promptly tweeted out his findings. To Carroll, his file seemed woefully incomplete. But to Dehaye and other experts of the internet, it seemed like exactly what he needed to prove a case. In answering Carroll at all, Dehaye argued, SCL conceded that even as an American, he was entitled to his data. But in showing him only the smallest slice of that data, Carroll and Dehaye believed, SCL had broken the law.
Dehaye put Carroll in touch with Ravi Naik, a British human rights lawyer, who had worked on data rights cases in the past. Immediately, he was like, This is going to be a massive case. Its going to set precedents, Carroll says.
Still, Naik was cautious, knowing that the case law regarding foreigners gaining access to their data was extremely limited, resting on just two cases where death row inmates from Thailand and Kenya had attempted to get their data from the British police. But Naik also viewed Carrolls case as the beginning of a new civil rights movement. Its really balancing the rights of individuals against those with mass power, Naik says.
In April 2017, Carroll and Naik sent whats known as a pre-action letter to SCL, laying out a legal claim. In the UK, these letters are used to determine if litigation can be avoided. In the letter, Naik and Carroll argued that not only had SCL violated the UKs Data Protection Act by failing to give Carroll all of the underlying data, the company hadnt received the proper consent to process data related to his political views to begin with. Under the law, political opinions are considered sensitive data.
Once again, Carroll got no additional data in return. According to Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica's then-CEO, the company shared certain data with Carroll as a gesture of ""good faith,"" but received legal advice that foreigners didn't have rights under the Data Protection Act. Asked why the company didn't share more of that data, Nix said, ""There was no legal reason to comply with this request, and it might be opening ... a bottomless pit of subject access requests in the United States that we would be unable to fulfill just through the sheer volume of requests in comparison to the size of the company."" (After answering WIRED's questions, Nix retroactively asked for these answers to be off the record. WIRED declined.)
Carroll wasnt the only person who had tried and failed to get his data from SCL. Initially, Naik says, about 20 people around the world were on board. But when it came time to bring the case to court, he says, they needed only one complainant, and it was Carroll who was most willing to take the risk. It says a lot about David that hes willing to stand by not just his own rights but also the rights of everyone affected, to work out what this company was doing, Naik says.
Carroll and Naik spent the bulk of 2017 preparing the case and hedging their bets against worst case scenarios, of which there were many. In the British legal system, whoever loses a legal case winds up paying the winning sides fees. Carroll worried that could amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars, the kind of costs he couldnt bear on his own. So that fall, Carroll launched his own legal defense fund on CrowdJustice and announced his plans to file the complaint in The Guardian. Suddenly, he was flooded with support from strangers whod grown similarly suspicious of Cambridge Analytica. He raised nearly $33,000 in a matter of weeks. Today, hes raised another $10,000 more.
In January, the British Information Commissioner found SCL guilty of refusing an order to return Carrolls data. Carroll was awarded a small sum of money, but is still fighting for access to his information.
But for all the encouragement Carroll received, almost as soon as he went public with his plans he also got more than a few words of warning. Once, Carroll says, a Cambridge Analytica employee approached him after a film screening at The New School, shook his hand for a few beats too long, and told him to drop the case. Another time, Carroll got a mysterious email about a British journalist who had supposedly been investigating SCL when he died suddenly falling down the stairs. Please dont forget how powerful these individuals are, the email read.
It was almost certainly a coincidence, and Carroll never followed up with the woman who sent the email. I didnt want her to talk me out of it, Carroll says. But he still couldnt help but feel spooked. In the fall of 2017, he rightly felt like he had a lot to lose.
The night we met in the coffee shop, I asked Carroll whether all these risks he was taking worried him. He smiled anxiously and said, It scares the shit out of me.
A few months later, I spotted Carroll across a crowded auditorium at PutinCon, a gathering of reporters, foreign policy experts, intelligence officials, and professional paranoiacs being held in an undisclosed location in Manhattan. The express purpose of the conference was to discuss how Russia is crippled by totalitarian rule and explore how Russian president Vladimir Putins power is based in fear, mystery, and propaganda.
But Carroll had other matters on his mind. That day, March 16, 2018, his lawyers in London were finally serving SCL with a formal legal claim, requesting disclosure of his data and laying out their intention to sue for damages. The request had been more than a year in the making, and Carroll spent much of the morning darting out to the hallway, exchanging Signal messages with Naik, even though he was scared that any venue hosting something called PutinCon must have been hacked.
After Naiks colleague served SCL with the paperwork, Carroll stood looking at his phone in satisfied disbelief. Its finally real, he told me. Its not just an idea anymore.
There was one other thing. Carroll said hed heard rumblings from British journalist Carole Cadwalladr that some big news regarding Cambridge Analytica was coming from The Guardian and The New York Times. Its going to make Facebook look really bad, he said.
Less than 24 hours later, Carroll turned out to be more right than he even knew. The next morning, photos of a pink-haired, self-styled whistleblower and former SCL contractor named Christopher Wylie were splashed across pages of The New York Times and The Guardian. Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach, read the Guardian headline. How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions, read the Times. The night before, Facebook had tried to preempt the stories, announcing it was suspending Wylie, Cambridge Analytica, SCL, and Aleksandr Kogan for violating its policies against sharing Facebook data with third parties.
That hardly helped Facebooks case. The news did more than make Facebook look bad. It did what history may judge to be irreparable damage to a company at the peak of its unprecedented power. Facebooks stock price plummeted. Zuckerberg was summoned to Congress. The company gave itself the impossible task of auditing apps that had access to mass amounts of data, and began cutting off other developers from collecting even more. Google searches for how to delete Facebook spiked.
In the end, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that as many as 87 million people may have been affected by the data intrusion. Eventually, the Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation into whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree regarding its data privacy practices. ""I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform,"" Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook days after the news broke. ""While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn't change what happened in the past.""
Earlier this month, The Washington Postreported that the FTC is considering imposing a record-setting fine against Facebook.
As bad as things were for Facebook, they soon got worse for Cambridge Analytica. Days after Wylies story first made headlines, Britains Channel 4 News began airing a series of devastating undercover videos that showed the firms once sought-after CEO, Alexander Nix, discussing using dirty tricks like bribery and blackmail on behalf of clients. In one case, Nix boasted that using Ukrainian women to entrap politicians works very well.
Nix has since denied that the company engages in those practices. ""That was just a lie to impress the people I was talking to, he told a parliamentary committee last summer. But almost as soon as the videos aired, Nix was replaced as CEO. By May, buried under an avalanche of negative press, SCL Group announced it was shutting down completely and filing for bankruptcy and insolvency in the US and the UK. Today, just one of its many corporate propertiesSCL Insightsis still up and running.
As SCL was crumbling, Carrolls case took on a new sense of urgency. He was thrown into the media firestorm, crisscrossing Manhattan as he discussed his claim on an alphabet soup of television networks. Suddenly, this wasnt just a wonky academic endeavor to retrieve data from some company. It was a story about rescuing that data from the one company the public had decided, and Facebook had claimed, was singularly sinister. Chris Wylie took the story that I knew was a big deal for a long time and made it a worldwide story, a household name, Carroll says.
When the news broke in March, the UKs Information Commissioners Office was already investigating SCL for its refusal to hand over Carrolls data. Carroll and Naik had filed a complaint with the ICO in 2017. But for months, SCL told the regulator that as an American, Carroll had no more rights to his data than a member of the Taliban sitting in a cave in the remotest corner of Afghanistan. The ICO disagreed. In May, days after SCL declared bankruptcy, the regulator issued an order, directing the firm to give Carroll his data once and for all. Failure to comply within 30 days, they warned, would result in criminal charges.
SCL never complied. Julian Wheatland, director of SCL Group, told me he thinks the guilty plea the company issued in January is a shame and says it merely represented the path of least resistance for SCLs liquidators, who oversee the insolvency proceedings and are duty bound to maximize the companys assets. There was little option but to plead guilty, as the cost of fighting the case would far outweigh the cost of pleading guilty, Wheatland says. SCLs administrators declined WIREDs request for comment.
The ICO fine was ultimately measly. Carrolls slice of it couldnt buy him more than a MetroCard and a bag of groceries. Its also no guarantee hell get his data. Naik is still waging that battle on Carrolls behalf, as SCLs insolvency proceedings progress. Meanwhile, an ICO spokesperson confirmed that the office now has access to SCLs servers and is assessing the material on them, which could help to bring Carrolls information to light.
But the ICOs charges were meaningful nonetheless. It clearly underscored the fact that people outside the UK had these rights to begin with. ""This prosecution, the first against Cambridge Analytica, is a warning that there are consequences for ignoring the law, the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said in a statement following the hearing. Wherever you live in the world, if your data is being processed by a UK company, UK data protection laws apply.
By the time I interviewed Carroll in June 2018, about a month after SCL announced it was shutting down and just days after the ICOs deadline had ticked by, the fear Carroll felt that first time we met had almost evaporated. We were in London to hear Cambridge Analyticas fallen CEO Alexander Nix state his case before a committee of British parliamentarians. It seemed as if the entire cast of characters involved in the story had settled into the hearing rooms green upholstered chairs. There was Cadwalladr, The Guardian reporter whod cracked the story open, and Wylie, the pink-haired source whod helped her do it. Carroll sat to my right, busily tweeting every tense exchange between a defiant and defensive Nix and his inquisitors.
There was also a documentary film crew, stationed toward the back of the room. Theyd been trailing Carroll for months.
When husband and wife team Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer initially set out to make what is now The Great Hack, back in 2015, they planned to follow the story of the Sony Pictures breach that had exposed the film studios secrets in what US intelligence officials said was an attack by North Korea. But as time went on, their attention, like that of the publics, shifted focus from the ways in which private information is straight-up stolen to all of the little ways we give it away to powerful corporations, often without realizing it or knowing what will happen to itand certainly without any way to claw it back.
That led them to Carroll. We were initially drawn to Davids story because his mission to reclaim his data summarized the complexities of this world into a single question: What do you know about me? the directors, who were nominated for an Academy Award for their film The Square, wrote in an email. One of the things that has become increasingly clear is that whether David gets his data back or not, his case has brought to light some of the largest questions around data privacy.
This weekend, Carroll will head to Park City, Utah, to see himself on the big screen. For Naik, the fact that a film like this is debuting to mainstream audiences represents an astonishing step in the data rights movement. This shows a rapid change in interest in this field and the interest in data rights as a real and enforceable facet of human rights, he says.
Over the past few years, these rights have expanded drastically. Last May, Europes General Data Protection Regulation went into effect across the European Union, giving Europeans the right to request and delete their data, and requiring businesses to receive informed consent before collecting that data. The law also established stricter reporting protocols around data breaches and created harsh new penalties for those who violate them.
Last summer, the state of California unanimously passed its own privacy law, which lets residents of the state see the information businesses collect on them and request that it be deleted. It also enables people to see which companies have purchased their data and direct businesses to stop selling it at all.
Some of the most influential business leaders in the world have simultaneously rallied around the cause. In Brussels last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook condemned what he called the data industrial complex and called for a federal law that would prevent personal information from being ""weaponized against us with military efficiency."" Even data gobblers like Google, Amazon, and Facebook have finally come out in support of a federal privacy law, partly due to the fact that such legislation could prevent the stricter California bill from taking effect in 2020.
If Congress is ever going to make good on its recent promises to crack down on rampant data mining, this could be the year. So far, senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) has floated some draft legislation. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Florida) proposed a bill that would task the FTC with drafting new rules. And in December, senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) introduced a bill of his own, cosponsored by 14 other Democrats, that requires companies to ""reasonably secure"" personally identifying information and promise not to use it for harm. It would also force businesses and the third parties they work with to notify users of data breaches and gives the FTC new authority to fine violators.
Just as doctors and lawyers are expected to protect and responsibly use the personal data they hold, online companies should be required to do the same, Schatz said in a statement when the bill was announced. Our bill will help make sure that when people give online companies their information, it wont be exploited.
Carroll isnt so sure. He says bills like this hardly address the underlying problem. If data is the new oil powering the economy, then what Schatz is proposing is a process for cleaning up the next oil spill. Its not a set of safety procedures to prevent that spill from happening in the first place. Thats what Carroll says the United States, whose homegrown tech giants control so much of the worlds data, desperately needs. He continues to believe his SCL file would prove how badly its needed.
Cambridge Analytica may have taken data from Facebook that it didnt have the right to, and Facebook may have made that data too easy to access. But the most overlooked fact in the whole saga is that Cambridge Analytica wasnt alone. From data brokers that track your every purchase to mobile phone carriers that sell your location to social media companies that give far more detail to developers than is necessary, theres an invisible, unregulated marketplace of personal information in the United States. And its no longer just being used to sell us new boots or connect us with high school classmates. Its being used to influence decisions about who the most powerful people in the world get to be.
Theyre not the only ones by any stretch of the imagination, Carroll says of SCL. Its a dirty business, but sunlight is the best disinfectant.
This is, perhaps, the one issue on which Carroll and Wheatland, SCLs director, see eye to eye. Wheatland predictably disagrees with the broad characterization of his company, whose very name has become a proxy for everything wrong with the data trade. He says Cambridge Analytica was a lightning rod for a confluence of feelings about President Trumps election, Facebook, Brexit, and the rising use of data. We found ourselves at the nexus of all of those and became the whipping boy, he says.
He doesnt find many sympathetic audiences for that message these days. But he, too, says that regulation is imperative, given the huge power of data modeling. And he too says theres a risk to casting Cambridge Analytica as somehow unique. This is an issue that is much bigger than one company, he says. If we take this villain mentality and think that weve moved on, we havent. Weve lost Cambridge Analytica, but we havent moved on at all.
Carroll is hardly pouring one out for the loss of Cambridge Analytica. Far from it. As he watched Nix stammer and squirm in his tailored suit that June afternoon in Parliament, Carroll couldnt help but recognize how dramatically their roles had been reversed.
These last two years have been emotionally taxing and at times lonely for Carroll, whos become absorbed by an issue that sometimes even the people closest to him failed to understand. But every new break in the case has provided some validation that its all been worth it. I dont feel like Im up against the wall, he told me the night of Nixs hearing, the documentary crews cameras trained on his face. Theyre up against the wall.
But he stopped short of declaring victory. Not until he gets his data back, and sees some real change come of it. All I want is everything, he said. Because Im entitled to it. And so is everyone.

NICHOLAS KRISTOF,"Prof. Michael E. Mann of Penn State told me that Hurricane Michael should be a wake-up call. As should have Katrina, Irene, Sandy, Harvey, Irma, Florence, he added wryly. In each of these storms we can see the impact of climate change: Warmer seas means more energy to intensify these storms, more wind damage, bigger storm surge and more coastal flooding. As recently as the early 2000s, there wasnt much difference between the parties on climate policy, and Senator John McCain campaigned in 2008 as a leader in reducing carbon emissions. In 2009, Donald Trump joined other business executives in backing more action to address climate change. Yet in the following years Al Gore helped make climate change a Democratic issue, and the Koch brothers helped make climate denial a litmus test of Republican authenticity. Tribalism took over, and climate skepticism became part of the Republican creed. So polls show that today climate denial is far greater in the United States, home to the greatest scientific research in the world, than in just about any other major country. Trump says he will pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, and he had nothing substantive to say about a new United Nations report, which has been called a deafening, piercing smoke alarm of catastrophic consequences ahead from climate change. Republicans are correct that all this is uncertain. But in every other context, we try to prevent threats that are uncertain, and its irrational for Trump to be obsessed with, say, Iran, when he seems indifferent to the prospect that we are collectively cooking our entire planet. There are legitimate debates about the best way to reduce carbon emissions, and there is reason for skepticism that we will succeed. Carbon taxes would have to be very substantial to have a large impact, geoengineering is uncertain, and there will be painful trade-offs ahead.","Hurricane Michael hit Port St. Joe, Fla., with full force on Wednesday.",2018-10-10T23:24:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The ‘Greatest Hoax’ Strikes Florida,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/opinion/climate-change-hurricane-michael.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/opinion/10kristofSub/10kristofSub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1
Kate Conger,"A pair of hackers discovered a vulnerability in Air Force software that allowed them to gain access to the Department of Defense’s unclassified network—a find that earned them more than $10,000, the largest payout ever in a government bug bounty program. Security researchers Brett Buerhaus and Mathias Karlsson uncovered the vulnerability during Hack the Air Force, a bug bounty program similar to the Hack the Army and Hack the Pentagon program s run by the US Defense Department. Bug bounty programs, which reward hackers who find vulnerabilities with cash, are common in the tech industry. But the US government has been a bit slower to adopt them, for several reasons: Federal agencies have stricter guidelines about how they can spend their budgets, and they’re a bit more cautious about opening themselves up to hackers. But that’s been changing slowly since the Defense Department launched its first bug bounty last year. “I didn’t expect how willing they were to work with us to figure out the issue and see how impactful it was,” Buerhaus said in a statement. “There’s such a perception of the government being closed off and ready to sweep issues under the rug. It was great seeing how excited they were to work with us. This honestly changes everything, and it’s clear they care about working with us to protect their interests.” Over the course of just nine hours, Buerhaus, Karlsson, and dozens of other participating hackers were able to find 55 vulnerabilities in Air Force software. The program will continue through January 1, giving hackers even more time to find flaws. Bauerhaus and Karlsson will split the $10,650 bug bounty, which is more than twice the previous top Hack the Air Force bug bounty payout. The first Hack the Air Force challenge, which was held earlier this year, paid a top bug bounty of $5,000. Hack the Army and Hack the Pentagon have each maxed out around $3,000. (These are just the public payouts, though, and private bounties might be higher.) “Hack the Air Force allowed us to look outward and leverage the range of talent in our country and partner nations to secure our defenses,” Air Force chief information security officer Peter Kim said in a statement. “We’re greatly expanding on the tremendous success of the first challenge by opening up approximately 300 public facing AF websites. The cost-benefit of this partnership is invaluable.”","A pair of hackers discovered a vulnerability in Air Force software that allowed them to gain access to the Department of Defense’s unclassified network—a find that earned them more than $10,000, the largest payout ever in a government bug bounty program.

In the finals, athletes crashed or essentially gave up on 41 of 50 runs. Some approached the big jumps at full speed, only to pull up at the last moment because snow made it impossible to see or the wind socks on the jumps were completely stiffened. Tess Coady of Australia blamed the wind for a knee injury sustained in a training run before the competition. “Got picked up in the wind on the bottom jump in practice and my ACL was not a big fan!” she wrote on Instagram. Several miles away on Monday, the women’s giant slalom competition was postponed, just as the men’s downhill had been the day before. (They both ultimately took place on Thursday, the first somewhat still day of the Games.) It threw off training cycles and complicated the hopes of skiers like Mikaela Shiffrin, the American star who is aiming to win multiple gold medals. Because of the wind, she faced three straight days of races, hardly ideal. For most of a week, the blowing snow created white-out conditions on the ski courses. Gondolas tilted uncomfortably in the wind, and chair lifts were shut down. Race flags were blown off their poles. Mislaid gloves blew away. But wind is a fickle foe to plenty of winter sports, and it has affected all of the outdoor events. On the biathlon course, it was even harder than usual to shoot straight. At the ski jump, the 45-year-old veteran Noriaki Kasai of Japan said he had rarely felt such strong wind at a competition.

According to Reuters, 13 volunteers and three spectators receiving minor injuries from flying debris and 60 tents were damaged. The area was closed and fans shooed away. The giant circuslike tents that serve as workrooms for members of the news media were emptied. Who knew it could be so windy in such a lovely place? Actually, Olympic organizers did. The Pyeongchang 2018 Organizing Committee had a “meteorology and climate team” that supplied a 26-page report about weather, updated last year. The most dominant pattern this time of year, the report warned, was the “Siberian High,” as cold and dry winds from the northwest come with little obstruction all the way from Siberia. “High winds and low windchill temperatures are the most influential factors in particular during the Olympic period,” the report said. That explains the wind turbines.

Sidney Fussell,"U.S. Representative Kathleen Rice, a New York Democrat, has introduced a new bill that compels the Transportation Security Administration to adopt gender-neutral technologies and screening techniques. The “Screening With Dignity Act” mandates new training protocols, new privacy protections, and, chiefly, a cost analysis of recalibrating full-body screening technology to be more inclusive of transgendered and non-binary passengers. “No one should have to go through airport security scared that they might be humiliated, discriminated against or outed,” Rice told Them, an online publication focusing on queerness and political issues. “But unfortunately, many transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals worry about this every time they get in line at a TSA checkpoint.” Fifteen Democrats co-sponsored the bill, which also has support from the ACLU and the National Center for Trans Equality. As explained in Them, most full-body scanners require TSA agents to demarcate the body of the person being scanned as “male” or “female.” If the body of the person being scanned doesn’t fit into the built-in assumptions of either designation, they may be subjected to additional screening, physical pat-downs, further questioning, or other invasive measures. Travelers can request they not be scanned, but this can subject them to a physical pat-down, prompting the same concerns of discriminatory treatment. Further, travelers may be directed to additional screening if their gender presentation doesn’t match their specific state-approved ID, essentially leaving them at the mercy of what screening officers believe a man or woman looks like. As Them notes, even if travelers have a state-issued, gender-neutral or nonbinary ID, as issued in New York, Maine, and other places, TSA agents may not accept them. A spokesperson for the TSA told Them via email that the agency “recognizes the concerns that some members of the transgender community may have with certain security screening procedures at the nation’s security checkpoints.” “In 2018, maintaining high safety standards and screening all passengers with dignity cannot be mutually exclusive,” Rice told the site. “The transgender community deserves to be treated with fairness and respect in all aspects of life, and travel is no exception.” [ Them ]","U.S. Representative Kathleen Rice, a New York Democrat, has introduced a new bill that compels the Transportation Security Administration to adopt gender-neutral technologies and screening techniques.

Rhett Allain,"I don't know very much about bobsleds—but I know quite a bit about physics. Here is my very brief summary of the bobsled event in the winter Olympics. Some humans get in a sled. The sled goes down an incline that is covered in ice. The humans need to do two things: push really fast to get the thing going and turn to travel through the course. But from a physics perspective, it's a block sliding down an incline. Just like in your introductory physics course. So here is a block on a low friction inclined plane—see, that's just like a bobsled. You can see that there essentially just three forces acting on this box (bobsled). Let's take a quick look at each of these forces. In this situation, the gravitational force is the simplest because it doesn't change. When you are near the surface of the Earth, the gravitational force (also called the weight) just depends on two things: the gravitational field and the mass of the object. The gravitational field actually decreases as you get farther away from the center of the Earth—but even the top of the tallest mountain isn't that far away, so we say this value is constant. This gravitational field has a value of about 9.8 Newtons per kilogram and points straight down (and we use the symbol g for this). When you multiply the gravitational field by the mass (in kilograms), you get a force in Newtons. Simple. The next force is the force with which the inclined plane pushes up on the box. But wait! It's not really pushing up, it's pushing perpendicular to the surface. Since the force is perpendicular, we call this the normal force (the geometry definition of normal). However, there's still a small problem—there is no equation for normal force. The normal force is a force of constraint. It pushes with whatever magnitude it needs to to keep the box constrained to the surface of the plane. So really the only way to find the magnitude of this normal force is to assume the acceleration perpendicular to the plane is zero. That means that this force has to cancel the component of the gravitational force that is also perpendicular to the plane. In the end, the normal force will decrease as the angle of the incline increases (a block on a vertical wall would have zero normal force). The last force is the frictional force. Like the normal force, this force is also an interaction between the box and the plane. But this frictional force is parallel to the surface instead of perpendicular. If the block is sliding, we call this kinetic friction. In the most basic model, the magnitude of this frictional force depends on just two things: the types of surfaces interacting (we call this the coefficient of friction) and the magnitude of the normal force. The harder you push two surfaces together, the greater the frictional force (but you already knew that). Now we are ready for the important part—the relationship between force and acceleration. The magnitude of the total force on the object in one particular direction is equal to the product of the object's mass and acceleration. For the x-direction, this would look like this: The key here is that the acceleration of the object depends on both the total force and the mass of the object. If you keep the force constant but increase the mass, the object would have a smaller acceleration. Now let's put this all together. I will set the x-axis along the same direction as the plane. This means there are two forces that will influence the acceleration down the inclined plane: part of the gravitational force and the frictional force. The gravitational force obviously increases with mass—but so does the frictional force since it depends on the normal force. What we have are two forces that increase with mass. So the mass of the block doesn't matter for the acceleration down the incline. It only depends on the inclination angle and the coefficient of friction. In a race, a big block and a small block would end in a tie (assuming they started with the same speed). If mass doesn't matter, then why would a four person bobsled be faster than a two person one? Obviously, there must be some other force involved—one that doesn't depend on the mass of the object. This other force is the air resistance force. You already know about it: Whenever you stick your hand out of a moving car window, you can feel this air resistance force. In the basic model, it depends on several things: the density of air, the size and shape of the object, and the speed of the object. As you increase the speed, this air resistance force also increases. But notice that this does not depend on the mass. Let me show the impact this has on a bobsled with the following example. Suppose I have two blocks sliding down identical inclines and traveling at the same speed. Everything is identical except for the mass. Box A has a small mass and box B has a large mass. Although they have the same air force and same speed, the heavier box (box B) will have the greater acceleration. This same air resistance force will have a smaller impact on its acceleration because it has a larger mass. So mass does indeed matter in this case. Actually, the air drag matters quite a bit. That's why bobsled teams are also very concerned about the aerodynamics of their vehicle. When competing in the Olympics, every little bit matters.

Well, maybe not all of us. Ive just finished Vicky Wards Kushner, Inc., a scintillating investigation of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trumps White House sojourn, which comes out on Tuesday. Its full of damning details: contempt for the entitled, venal couple may be the one thing that unites all of D.C.s warring factions. Still, the first daughter and her husband remain psychologically mysterious, at least to me. Why dont they have impostor syndrome, given that their total lack of qualifications for the jobs they are doing makes them actual impostors?
According to Kushner, Inc., Gary Cohn, former director of the National Economic Council, has told people that Ivanka Trump thinks she could someday be president. Her fathers reign in Washington, D.C., is, she believes, the beginning of a great American dynasty, writes Ward. Kushner, whose pre-White House experience included owning a boutique newspaper and helming a catastrophically ill-timed real estate deal, has arrogated to himself substantial parts of American foreign policy. According to Ward, shortly after Rex Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of state, Kushner told him to leave Mexico to him because hed have Nafta wrapped up by October.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"The Chinese government’s anti-pornography office announced earlier this month that video streaming services in the nation need to “thoroughly clean up vulgar and pornographic ASMR content.” And while the agency called for a crackdown specifically on content that is “vulgar” or sexual in nature, many of China’s leading video hosting sites have scrubbed all ASMR videos. ASMR, which stands for autonomous sensory meridian response, became somewhat of an internet phenomenon over the last few years. The genre of video features soft sounds intended to soothe listeners. While some ASMR content is inherently erotic, there’s a large library of these videos that are hardly suggestive. A research paper on the phenomenon published in March 2015 indicated that only five percent of participants said that they used ASMR for “sexual stimulation,” with 82 percent reporting they use it as a sleep aid and 70 percent using it as a stress aid. Rather than eliminating only sexually-suggestive videos, as China’s anti-porn task force seemingly called for, the video services got rid of them all. Searching for “ASMR” from the U.S. on platforms Youku, Bilibili, and Douyu yields no results. Inkstone News reported that when you search for “ASMR” on Chinese website MissEvan, it states that the results can’t be shown since they “may involve content that violates relevant laws, regulations and policies.” “ASMR was banned???? Is it now considered sexual to eat something? How will I get to sleep now,” a user wrote on Weibo on Sunday, the Verge reported. However, it looks like there may already be a workaround to the sweeping ASMR ban. As Inkstone pointed out, users may be able to circumvent it by adding a space between the ASM and R. There are also still plenty of ASMR videos on a Weibo page dedicated to the subgenre.

 A Tornado came within close proximity of a drone over Suffolk
An RAF Tornado travelling at 517mph (832km/h) came within 22m (72ft) of hitting a drone, a report has revealed.
The jet, which was flying in formation 10 miles (16km) north-east of RAF Wattisham in Suffolk, did not see the remote-controlled aircraft, according to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
The drone pilot, which reported the incident, said there was a high risk of collision.
The CAA Airprox board's report said ""safety had been much reduced"".
The drone, which was carrying out an agricultural survey, was at an altitude of 100m (328ft) while the jet was at 121.9m (400ft) when the near-miss took place on 4 July.
The Airprox board said this, combined with a lack of visual warning, had resulted in ""a significant and largely unmitigated safety risk"" and recommended that RAF Air Command uses a system to receive notification of commercial drone operations.
While the drone operator was not required to inform RAF Wattisham of their plans, Air Command said they could have done so considering the proximity of the base. 
It praised the drone pilot for descending the aircraft once the Tornados had been detected.
However, the report said that while the drone operator had reacted swiftly, the speed of the Tornado meant there was little that could have been done to avoid a crash.
London Gatwick Airport was brought to a standstill last week when drones were sighted, while another Airprox report revealed a Boeing 737 came within 15m (50ft) of a drone while coming into land at Stansted in August.",A report on the incident is recommending the RAF uses a system to warn it of drone flights.,2018-12-24T06:29:28Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Farm drone in near-miss with air force jet,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-46633952,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10B57/production/_104893486_raftornado2.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,force,1

He earned the nickname “Pharma Bro,” and worse. Reporters revealed in 2015 that Shkreli bought the album — sold in a handcrafted silver and nickel box — for about $2 million. Wu Tang member RZA compared the singular item to “the scepter of an Egyptian king.” Shkreli often teased that he would play tracks from the album, but instead kept it to himself, to the ire of fans. In August, Shkreli was convicted of securities fraud, after a jury found that he had misled investors at hedge funds he ran. As part of that decision, prosecutors now say the court should force Shkreli to forfeit the equivalent of $7.4 million he criminally obtained. The motion seeks “substitute” assets to start covering those funds and, along with $5 million in cash for a bond, lists some peculiar items, among them an Enigma machine, a Picasso, and Tha Carter V — an unreleased Lil Wayne album that Shkreli claimed to have. But the most eye-popping request is for the Wu Tang album, which still has not been heard by the general public.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","It’s been forever since US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines required an annual pap smear, but I keep hearing from folks whose gynecologists only told them recently that they can skip a few years. Most of us only need screenings for cervical cancer every three to five years, and the pap smear is no longer the only option. How does cervical cancer screening work? The whole point of that uncomfortable moment at the gynecologist’s office, where your legs are up in stirrups, is to screen for cervical cancer. Most cases of cervical cancer result from a long-term infection with a virus known as HPV. Don’t panic—most people who are sexually active have been infected with HPV at some point without knowing it. Usually, your immune system clears out the infection, but occasionally, if the virus sticks around for many years, it can cause cells in your cervix (the place where your vagina meets your uterus) to become cancerous. There’s no cure for HPV, but regular screening can detect most cancers before they become a problem. When you get a pap smear, your gynecologist swabs some cells from your cervix and sends them to a lab, where a technician smears them (get it?) on a slide and looks at them through a microscope for clues, such as their shape, that they may be on the way to becoming cancerous. This is also known as cervical cytology (cytology is the study of cells) or a Papanicolaou test. But another, newer, type of test, called hrHPV testing, involves testing the swab for the presence of the HPV virus itself. (The hrHPV test specifically screens for high-risk versions of HPV. Some types of the virus are mostly harmless.) This type of testing became an add-on option for routine screening back in 2012, the same year we learned that screening could happen every three to five years, instead of every year. The most recent recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force are: People under age 21 don’t need cervical cancer screenings at all. From age 21 to 29, you should get a “cervical cytology” screening, better known as a pap smear. Your provider swipes some cells from your cervix and sends them to a lab where they’ll be examined to see if they look cancerous or pre-cancerous. These are due every three years. From age 30 to 64, you have the option of screening every five years if your provider sends your cervical swab for HPV testing instead of, or in addition to, the traditional pap smear analysis. If you’re 65 or older, and you’ve never had cervical cancer or high-grade lesions, you’re off the hook. No further tests are needed. Are pap smears obsolete? Some headlines are claiming that pap smears are becoming a thing of the past (if you’re over 30), but that doesn’t mean what you think it means. Whether you get a pap smear or an HPV test, or both, the exam room experience is the same: you’ll spread your legs and your provider will use a speculum to hold open your vagina, and they’ll use a swab-like tool (often actually a brush or tiny plastic spatula) to take a sample from your cervix. The previous recommendations, from 2012, used to require that every-five-years testing include cytology and an HPV test. The change for 2018 is just a small tweak: providers can order the HPV test alone. That doesn’t mean the pap smear experience is going away—the only difference is what happens to the swab afterward.","It’s been forever since US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines required an annual pap smear, but I keep hearing from folks whose gynecologists only told them recently that they can skip a few years.

Jacob Kastrenakes,"Facebook says that it won’t send Mark Zuckerberg to the UK to appear before a Parliamentary committee that threatened to force him to testify the next time he entered the country if he wouldn’t come willingly. In a letter, Facebook’s head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, wrote that Zuckerberg “has no plans to meet with the committee or travel to the UK at the present time.” She also sent her letter three days after the deadline Facebook was given to respond. While Zuckerberg appeared before US Congress and has plans to meet with EU lawmakers, he declined to meet with the UK’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Instead, Facebook sent Mike Schroepfer, its chief technical officer, to answer their questions. But the committee was unhappy with his answers — often, with the lack of them — if not also the snub. And so it sent Facebook a followup letter on May 1st saying that it would like Zuckerberg to appear to provide satisfactory responses. “We are disappointed... that the committee declared our response insufficient.” “We hope that he will respond positively to our request, but if not the committee will resolve to issue a formal summons for him to appear when he is next in the UK,” committee chairman Damian Collins wrote at the time. In a statement today, Collins said he is “disappointed” with Facebook’s response and lack of transparency. But he seems to be backing off of the summons threat and offers to accept testimony from Zuckerberg through a video call. Still, by declining to appear, Zuckerberg risks being forced to testify the next time he has a connecting flight through Heathrow and potentially facing arrest if he doesn’t go along. And at a bare minimum, he’s guaranteed to have further pissed off UK lawmakers. Facebook essentially says that it sees the request to see Zuckerberg as unreasonable. In her letter, Stimson writes that “Facebook has now held lengthy meetings or evidence sessions around the world.” That included providing written answers and five hours of testimony from a senior official to the UK committee. “We are disappointed after providing a very significant amount of information... that the committee declared our response insufficient.” Stimson’s letter also includes about 17 pages of answers to questions that Schroepfer didn’t give responses to during his testimony last month. One answer reveals that Facebook’s Like button, which sends data back to Facebook even if it isn’t clicked, is present on 8.4 million websites. Facebook’s tracking pixel, which also monitors users, is installed on 2.2 million websites. Collins says these answers still aren’t good enough. “Given that these were follow up questions to questions Mr. Schroepfer previously failed to answer, we expected both detail and data, and in a number of cases got excuses,” he writes. Facebook may want to avoid putting Zuckerberg in front of the UK’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee for a number of reasons. Aside from prolonging the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the committee has also shown itself to be substantially more technologically savvy than many lawmakers elsewhere and has thrown much tougher questions as the company. The committee plans to follow up with Facebook to “address significant gaps” in the company’s answers as it continues to investigate its data privacy practices, as well as issues around propaganda, election ads, and content moderation.",Facebook says that it won’t send Mark Zuckerberg to the UK to appear before a Parliamentary committee that threatened to force him to testify the next time he entered the country if he wouldn’t come willingly.,2018-05-15T14:05:11Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","Zuckerberg won’t go to UK for data privacy testimony, despite threat of future arrest",https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/15/17355532/zuckerberg-declines-to-testify-uk-committee-privacy,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jc39-BUWa0Dy0IAutuXTTDJL70I=/0x229:3000x1800/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10842263/953502232.jpg.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,force,1
Andrew Liptak,"Solo: A Star Wars Story premiered last night, and on the red carpet, Iron Man director Jon Favreau revealed a bit of news about his upcoming live-action Star Wars show : it’ll be set in the period between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens. Favreau spoke with Nerdist senior editor Dan Casey on the red carpet, telling him that the show will specifically be set seven years after the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, and that it’ll feature new characters utilizing the same sort of motion capture technology that he used in his live-action adaptation of The Jungle Book. He also indicated that half of the show has already been written. Exclusive: @Jon_Favreau confirms that his live action #StarWars series takes place 7 years after Battle of Endor, between #ReturnOfTheJedi and #TheForceAwakens.

Story coming to @nerdist... pic.twitter.com/iRyPS8hPDR — Dan Casey (@DanCasey) May 11, 2018 The as-of-yet-untitled live action show will join the recently announced Star Wars: Resistance, in the post- Return of the Jedi era of the franchise. Resistance will be the third animated Star Wars show from Dave Filoni, who created The Clone Wars and Star Wars: Rebels. Filoni was also on the red carpet last night, but didn’t divulge any details about the series, other than to say that he is excited about the new art style that the show will have. The 30-year period between original and sequel trilogies is one that’s ripe for new material, especially after Lucasfilm decided to render the pre-Disney works non-canon back in 2014. Beginning in 1991 with Timothy Zahn’s Heir to the Empire, the Expanded Universe continued the post- Return of the Jedi era with an extensive series of novels and comics. That period has slowly been replaced with a new series of works, such as Chuck Wendig’s Aftermath trilogy (set a year after Return of the Jedi ) and Delilah S. Dawson’s Phasma (set 26 years after Return of the Jedi). This news means that the show will be completely different from the long-developed live-action show from George Lucas. That project was first announced in 2005 and would have been set in the underworld of the galactic capital, Coruscant, sometime between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. In this new setting, Favreau will likely be able to explore the rise of the First Order along with the other major developments that led to the events of the sequel trilogy. Favreau’s show will launch on Disney’s upcoming streaming service, which was announced last year. The service will allow Disney to showcase its extensive content library, and will reportedly include a range of original projects, including those in its Marvel and Star Wars franchises. The service is expected to debut sometime in the fall of 2019.",At the premiere of Solo: A Star Wars Story Iron Man director Jon Favreau revealed that his upcoming live action Star Wars show will be set in the period between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.,2018-05-11T15:21:48Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Jon Favreau’s Star Wars series will be set between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens,https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/11/17344260/star-wars-series-jon-favreau-live-action-disney-streaming-time-period,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9l2FVwMPkupOvCVQJt0Ooj_EmRY=/0x0:3696x1935/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10822157/957161830.jpg.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,force,1
Matt Novak,"The U.S. Air Force has released the first images of its latest combat drone, the XQ-58A Valkyrie. The new aircraft, which went from concept to first test flight in 2.5 years, behaved as expected on its first test flight this week, according to the Air Force.
The 76-minute inaugural flight occurred on March 5, 2019 at Yuma Proving Grounds in Arizona. The Air Force released a short 15-second video of the first flight to show it off, something that the military doesnt do with all of its aircraft.
The drone was developed for the Air Force Research Laboratorys (AFRL) Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) program which seeks to develop new planes for the military both quickly and inexpensively. 
XQ-58A is the first example of a class of UAV that is defined by low procurement and operating costs while providing game changing combat capability, Doug Szczublewski, AFRLs XQ-58A Program Manager, said in a statement.
The XQ-58A drone reportedly has a range of well over 2,000 miles and can carry both precision-guided bombs and surveillance equipment.
As Tyler Rogoway at The Drive notes, the new drone is specially suited to operate at the direction of manned planes nearby under a concept the Air Force calls its loyal wingman program. Theoretically, a piloted fighter jet could travel alongside a number of these unpiloted Valkyries, which would assist by doing everything from jamming enemy radar to firing on a target.
Rogoway also notes that the finished drone looks remarkably like the earliest concept renderings that were released by its developer, the San Diego-based military contractor Kratos Defense. Kratos is on the forefront of the latest weapons technologies, having recently developed the AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System system for the U.S. Navy. Laser weapons, which fall into the category of directed-energy weapons, are being shown off by Americas New Cold War adversary Russia with increased frequency.
The cost of the XQ-58A Valkyrie program wasnt released publicly, but the best estimates put the budget at roughly $2-3 million per plane.

Tom McKay,"A joint federal-state task force tracking the MS-13 gang tried and failed to force Facebook to help it wiretap calls made through its Messenger app, Reuters reported on Friday, even launching an unsuccessful attempt to hold the social media titan in contempt of court for refusing to do so. Reuters reported that a federal judge in Fresno, California sided with Facebook, though the proceedings are still sealed and the reasoning behind the ruling remains unclear. However, the news agency added that telecommunications law requires telcos and phone companies give access to phone lines to authorities with a warrant but exempts many apps that rely solely on internet infrastructure like Messenger, which runs over cellular data connections or wi-fi. Reuters wrote: Members of a joint federal and state task force probing the international criminal gang MS-13 had tried in August to hold Facebook in contempt of court for failing to carry out a wiretap order, Reuters reported last month. Arguments were heard in a sealed proceeding in a U.S. District Court in Fresno, California weeks before 16 suspected gang members were indicted there, but the judge ruled in Facebooks favor, the sources said. The details of his reasoning were not available... An affidavit by an FBI agent filed publicly in the Fresno criminal proceedings said that at the time of the arrests, law enforcement could not monitor any Messenger calls. According to Reuters, the government was nonetheless able to intercept all ordinary phone calls and Messenger texts between the accused gang members. Many details about what exactly the government was seeking are unclear. As the Verge noted, regular conversations in Messenger including realtime voice calls are not protected by end-to-end encryption, a security feature that ensures only the devices sending or receiving the data can decode it. (One reason for this is that Facebook scans messages for advertising purposes.) However, there is a Secret Conversations feature that enables end-to-end encryption for messages as well as photos, videos, and audio files, though not actual calls. There had been speculation that this is what authorities wanted to gain access to, though in a public affidavit submitted on August 30th, 2018, an FBI agent wrote that they were seeking access to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, referring to the realtime calls. Reuters previously reported that Facebooks position is that it would have to either rewrite its encryption code to install a surveillance backdoorsomething that would threaten the security of the whole platform at a time when Facebook is already experiencing numerous privacy crisesor or else [hack] the governments current target, according to... sources. While some previous rulings have forced telecoms to allow wiretapping of some VoIP systems, those chat, gaming, or other internet services that are not tightly integrated with existing phone infrastructure are generally exempted, Reuters added. Since Facebooks VoIP calls do not feature true end-to-end encryption such as other services like WhatsApp, they would be easier to tap and thus harder to protect in court. So it seems like the company dodged a real bullet. As the Verge wrote last month, researcher Philipp Hancke discovered in 2015 that the session keys used to encrypt the calls are shared with Facebook servers during a protocol called SDES, meaning they could be used to retroactively decrypt traffic. However, Hancke told the Verge it is possible Facebook takes steps to protect that data on top of the protocol, whether its refusing to log the keys or encrypting the entire handshake. Facebook may have also updated their security in the intervening years, the Verge wrote: They will be able to do a much more plausible denial if they have removed the old SDES stuff altogether, Hancke says. If they have not, they might argue that they do not log the keying material as it passes through their servers. Neither Facebook nor the government will talk to media about the case, Reuters wrote: Neither prosecutors nor Facebook would answer questions about the Fresno U.S. Attorneys office attempt to hold Facebook in contempt or about the underlying wiretap request, including why the matter was dismissed. That the battle involves MS-13 is notable, because just like with Apples legal battles with the FBI over iPhone encryption in the wake of the San Bernardino mass shooting in 2015, the government picked an ideal villain to test the limits of their surveillance options. Donald Trump and his administration have denounced the gang as violent animals, which the Washington Post fairly characterized as a pretext to pretend there is some subset of a massive population of people who are so depraved and dangerous as to be animals necessitating a massive and occasionally violent response. In other words, it looks an awful lot like authorities chose the least sympathetic defendants possible to expand their surveillance envelope in ways that have ramifications for countless millions of Facebook users. More details on what is going on should be available down the road, though for now it looks like the feds have again failed to coerce a company into compromising its security. Not that Facebook needs any help with that: The company disclosed this week that a massive security breach may have given hackers access tokens to tens of millions of accounts in what might prove to be the biggest security failure in its history.

Rhett Allain,"No one can deny that there are some great physics videos out there in the wild internet. Today, I found this one floating around—featuring what appears to be a worker that needs to get out of a cone-shaped hole. Oh sure, he could possibly climb up the side or maybe even use a rope as an assist. But no. This guy studied his physics. He knows a great trick to get out of this hole—by running in circle. But how does it work? Climbing Up the Side Suppose this was just an ordinary worker that tried to walk straight up the side of the hole. Of course there must be some force on him to prevent him from sliding back down the incline—that's the frictional force. The frictional force is parallel to the surface of the hole, and its magnitude depends on two factors. The first is called the coefficient of static friction, which is normally represented by the variable μ s. Depending on the two types of surfaces interacting, the coefficient will have a value between 0 and 1; the higher the value, the rougher the interaction. The second factor is the normal force: the force the surface exerts on the object that is perpendicular to the surface. If you have a flat surface with an object at rest, the surface pushes up with the same force as the gravitational force pulling down. However, as you move to a sloped surface, this value decreases. Overall, I can write the maximum frictional force as: How steep of an incline can you walk up? This depends on both the coefficient of friction and the incline angle. If a person is moving up at a constant speed, then the net force must be zero. Here is a force diagram showing a human moving up a slope that is tilted θ above the horizontal. Yes, I am using a box to represent the person. It's fine. The normal force pushes just enough to cancel the component of the gravitational force that pushes perpendicular to the plane. In the above diagram, if the normal force was equal in magnitude to the gravitational force the box would accelerate off the surface. That would just be super weird. Instead, this normal force only provides enough to prevent the box from moving into the surface. As the angle of incline increase, there is less gravitational force pushing into the plane, so the normal force decreases. This is why it's difficult to walk up a very steep slope. The steeper the slope, the lower the normal force. With a smaller normal force you will have a lower maximum frictional force. At some point, you just start sliding down the slope. That's bad. Running in a Circle Here's where the physics trick comes into play. If you could increase the normal force on a human, you would also increase the frictional force. But how could you do this? Imagine that you're riding in a car and this car is driving around in a circle turning to the left. If the car is turning to the left, there must be some force pushing you in the direction of the turn (and towards the center of the circle). This force might be from the door or maybe from the seatbelt, but there must be a force. When an object moves in a circle (even at a constant speed), it must have an acceleration component perpendicular to the velocity. The magnitude of this acceleration increases as you increase the speed and decreases as you increase the size of the circle. If you have an acceleration, you have to have a force. So in order to move in a circle there needs to be a force. Now back to the construction worker. When he runs in a circle, he needs that extra force to push towards the center of the hole. This extra circular force (technically, it would be call the centripetal force) would have to come from the normal force. Yes, the total magnitude of the normal force would increase so that there would a larger component of this force pointing towards the center of the circle. With a larger normal force, you get a larger frictional force. Boom. That's just what he needs—a larger frictional force to escape the hole. It's a brilliant move.",You could climb out of a hole with a ladder or a rope—or you could call on your formidable physics knowledge.,2017-11-14T21:45:36Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",How to Hoist Yourself Out of a Hole With Physics,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-hoist-yourself-out-of-a-hole-with-physics/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a0b5aef81f0642e8fbda99a/191:100/pass/running-TA.jpg,wired,Wired,force,1
CHRISTINE NEGRONI,"“There’s no single big red ‘easy’ button to be pushed” to overcome these hurdles, said Maj. Gen. Mark Smith, the national commander and chief executive of the Civil Air Patrol, an auxiliary of the United States Air Force. The Civil Air Patrol and similar organizations around the world give teenagers experience in a military environment so they can determine whether it is right for them. In the summer, the 17 countries participating in the International Air Cadet Exchange Program send young people overseas to fly planes, work on machines, take survival courses and spend time on different military bases. “Young people have to have the opportunity to get hands-on experience and explore potential career opportunities that are aviation-related or of interest to the air force, like cyber security or maintenance or logistics, robotics and unmanned vehicles,” said Brent Wolfe, secretary general of the Canada-based cadet exchange. As part of the 2018 United States defense budget, a small amount has been set aside to help pay for flight training for cadets who otherwise would not be able to afford it. It is part of the Civil Air Patrol’s mission to promote aviation and careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). General Smith said helping the cadets get a private pilot’s license could “prime the pump” and motivate some to fly for the military and maybe even become the kind of pilots who will inspire the next generation. “There are a lot of kids that think the Thunderbirds and Blue Angels are amazing and really cool,” General Smith said. “They give kids an appreciation for what the military is doing.”","An Air Force Thunderbird pilot prepared for a training flight in March at Orlando Melbourne International Airport in Melbourne, Fla.",2018-07-16T09:00:08Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Military Spending Is Up, but Aerospace and Defense Workers Are Scarce",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/us/military-aerospace-defense-workers.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/16/business/16military1/16military1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1
"Gwen Ihnat on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Every modern parent knows the struggle and constant conflicts involved with what seems like a fairly natural process: feeding their child. Breastfeeding or bottle? When should you start solid food? And, when the kids get a little older: What can you do with a picky child who refuses vegetables, short of force-feeding? The stress of organizing your child’s menu can be greatly exacerbated if they happen to be overweight: Then you’re not only worried about their health, but are also faced with a “tremendous stigma” socially, according to “The Checkup” column yesterday in The New York Times by Perri Klass, M.D. In “Do parents make their kids fat?” Dr. Klass talks to pediatricians about how much culpability can be attached to the well-meaning parent: There’s an underlying assumption here about what adults can control, and about how children can be controlled, if only their parents would take the trouble, or make and enforce healthy rules for the whole family, or read the nutritional information on the back of the cereal box. This column was apparently inspired by the reaction to one Klass wrote in November about “How Not To Talk To A Child Who Is Overweight.” Because the internet is awesome, comments included shaming statements about “overweight parents feeding garbage ‘foods’… to their overweight children,” and scolds like “Wake up parents… Your kids don’t HAVE to snack all the time. You are ruining their future health and self esteem.” Much as we may sometimes wish our kids were obedient robots, and we may pine for the time when we fed them creamed spinach without a whimper on either side, the fact remains that these little humans have their very own strong opinions, and rightly so. I’ve mentioned before that when my twins were babies, I loved making their food, roasting a variety of gourds and pureeing with apples and pears. They never even had a bite of sugar until their own first birthday cake. Since then, though, it’s been an uphill battle, where I can still find stashes of Halloween candy in the back of a dresser drawer in February, as they know they have to furtively hide this contraband from me, or else I’ll just toss it (well, not the chocolate). Having twins gives me a built-in control group, and I can assure any fretful parents that we attest a lot to nature over nurture. Obviously, we have organized our kids’ mealtimes the exact same way, but we have one extremely adventurous eater (my son) and one where I can list the things she’ll actually eat on two hands with some fingers left over (my daughter). Most of our dinners do not come from a box or a drive-through lane, but from scratch. We sit down at the table and eat together. There are no screens allowed. These factors all help our dining room avoid the “obesogenic” environment that the NYT describes. And yet, my daughter will prefer to have only a cup of plain rice while the rest of us eat delicious panang curry, shaking our heads. I was pleased to see that the NYT backs up my amateur research: “No one is saying that biology has to be destiny, pure and simple, but it is clear that the healthy eating strategies that are easy to implement with some children are far more difficult with others.” So far my kids are extremely healthy (knock wood). But do I worry that my daughter’s disdain for food from the ground will eventually adversely affect her health? (The two strawberries I put on her breakfast plate this morning eventually got moved back to the fridge, uneaten.) Of course I do. So, like many parents, I was quick to click on Dr. Klass’ column. And I am somewhat soothed by her summary: For all children, whatever their risk for obesity, good parental decisions about nutrition really matter: It’s important not to overfeed babies, to keep junk food and sugary drinks out of the house, to not let kids eat in front of the screen, and to encourage kids to “eat the rainbow” of fruits and vegetables. But those who rush to judgment should be aware that it is not at all simple to “say no” all the time to an extra-hungry child, or to “feed more vegetables” to the kid who refuses to eat anything green… Most parents—really—are doing our best, in the complicated food environment in which our children are growing up, with the daily struggles of family life. So, while force-feeding is not an option—I’m still going to keep pushing those strawberries for snack.","Every modern parent knows the struggle and constant conflicts involved with what seems like a fairly natural process: feeding their child.

Matt Novak,"The US Air Force conducted America’s first successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test of the year, firing an unarmed Minuteman III from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California yesterday morning. The missile landed in the Pacific Ocean at an undisclosed location. The test comes in the wake of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un proclaiming that his country is suspending both ICBM and nuclear tests for the foreseeable future. Kim is getting ready to meet with President Trump in the coming weeks or months. An exact date and location for the historic meeting have yet to be determined, though neutral countries like Sweden and Switzerland are high on the list of probabilities. As the Air Force Times notes, this was the first American ICBM test since August of 2017. Another test was originally planned for February of this year but was postponed. After the last test in 2017, Air Force officials announced that the ICBM had traveled roughly 4,200 miles to land near the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. No announcement was made about where this unarmed missile landed. You can watch video of the test on YouTube : While North Korean missile tests regularly make front page headlines in the US, American missile tests don’t receive much coverage at all. But you can bet that it gets attention in North Korea. Kim’s meeting with Trump isn’t the only high-profile meeting that’s coming up. On Friday, Kim will walk across the line that divides North and South Korea to meet with South Korean president Moon Jae-in. And it should be an interesting preview of what’s to come when Kim and Trump finally meet face to face. The White House has sent mixed messages in recent weeks, as President Trump often mischaracterizes Kim’s pledge to stop the country’s tests as a pledge to denuclearize. But the North Korean regime hasn’t made any such promise. Diplomacy is good, but here’s hoping that Trump’s advisors, like the uber-hawkish John Bolton, aren’t setting the president up to fail. If Trump walks away from his meeting with Kim without a plan for complete denuclearization we can only hope that it’s not positioned by the Trump regime as a total loss. Otherwise the stalemate between North Korea and the US could turn into a very real war. John Bolton, who has openly called for a first strike against North Korea, is waiting in the wings for his chance to pounce if anything should go wrong. In the meantime, it appears the US will continue to conduct missile tests as usual.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Jurors in the Van Dyke trial could easily see from the video that Mr. McDonald, though armed with a knife, was veering away when Officer Van Dyke shot him 16 times. Prosecutors also established that Officer Van Dyke had essentially made up his mind to use deadly force even before he arrived at the scene. We are going to have to shoot the guy, he reportedly told his partner while en route. Officer Van Dykes testimony about that danger he faced held no sway. We just didnt buy it, one juror said. Top police and city officials may not have bought it, either, but they stood by the officers tales for months. Then, in April 2015, the city settled a case with Mr. McDonalds family for $5 million, a move that prevented a trial at which the video could be shown. The city withheld the video for more than a year, releasing it in November 2015 only after a judge ordered it to do so. The McDonald case with its false statements, shoddy internal investigations and concealed evidence is typical of how the department has historically operated. A 2017 Justice Department report, for example, found many cases in which the department had swallowed whole a police officers version of events that was later disproved by video evidence. The report also said that the city had failed to investigate a majority of the police misconduct cases it was required by law to examine, sometimes because of provisions in the union contract that reinforced a pervasive code of silence that has long existed among officers.",An officer’s shooting of a teenager shocked the city.

David Murphy,"Last month, I felt a disturbance in the Force, as if millions of crappy songs from 2003 to 2015 cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. And they were. MySpaceyes, its still aroundlost all the music uploaded to the site between these years thanks to some corrupted data during a server migration. Whoops.
And while the news probably doesnt put a dent in most peoples days, since those musically inclined have long since moved on to other social networks and services (like SoundCloud), all hope is not lost. Thanks to an anonymous academic study, a total of 490,000 MP3s previously living on MySpace between 2008 and 2010 have been recovered. You can now find this archive, dubbed the The Myspace Dragon Hoard, over at archive.org.
There are a few caveats to this mega-collection, however. First off, its hugea whopping 1.3 terabytes, split into 144 separate .ZIP archives. While a handy .TSV file (short for Table-Separate Values) can help you figure out whats in the entire collection, theres no easy way to grab a single archive that contains a smattering of songs you want.
If youre looking to dump said archive to your desktop or laptop, I recommend using a tool like JDownloader to queue and download all the .ZIP files. Also, you probably dont want to do this on wifi, nor at your local Starbucks (or other favorite hotspot). Stick to a wired connection, and heres hoping your ISP doesnt have any annoying data caps.
Otherwise, you can search for individual songs and stream them directly from archive.org. Just use the Hobbit tool created for this archive, which gives you a MySpace-like player and search abilities directly in your browser. The tool might take a bit of time to load the index for the massive MP3 collection, but it workscrudely. You cant use this player to browse, only search, so prepare to spend some time querying for your favorite, obscure bands. 
However, the tool does let you download individual tracks, which is probably all youll really use this MySpace collection for anyway. After all, the saved files only represent a tiny fraction of the millions of lost musical tracks that are now but fragments in the great digital ether.","Last month, I felt a disturbance in the Force, as if millions of crappy songs from 2003 to 2015 cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.

"Mike Fahey on Kotaku, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","From January 23 through February 18 I was confined to a hospital bed, recovering from a surgical procedure that required me to remain almost completely prone in order to heal. Fortunately I came to the hospital prepared, and managed to still play Kingdom Hearts 3, Jump Force, Apex Legends and Anthem. All I needed was the right gear. 
I did not get much gaming done during my hospital stay last year, which ran from March 22 to July 3. I spent the first couple of weeks mostly unconscious. Then it took a good month to get my arms and fingers working properly again. Once I was as functional as I was going to get, the hospital television was too small and distant to properly game on. I fiddled with my iPad and gamed a little on my Switch, but mostly I just watched commercial television and sighed a lot. 
But not this time around. Knowing I was going into the hospital, rather than it being an incredibly unpleasant surprise, made all the difference. Before embarking on my surgical journey, I assembled my arsenal. Heres what made my hospital gaming good. 
Gaems Sentinel Personal Gaming Environment
Every hospital room comes with a television, most of which will accept an HDMI connection. Most hospital room televisions are also A) quite small and B) too far away. Just look at this setup here.
There is no way in hell I could comfortably game on that far-off television set. 
Washington-based accessory maker Gaems makes monitor cases, suitcase-styled carrying cases for game consoles with displays built into the lid. The $350 Gaems Sentinel looks like a mild-mannered plastic briefcase. 
But inside its exactly what the company calls ita personal gaming environment. Inside is a place to securely strap an Xbox One, PlayStation 4 or any standard game console with an HDMI out. A short included cable connects the console to the top portion of the case, which includes a 17 inch, 1920 x 1080 monitor, a pair of fairly nice built-in speakers and dual headphone ports. It even comes with a remote control for power, volume and brightness, which is mighty handy when you arent allowed to sit up. 
When everything is connected, the Sentinel and connected console become an intimate tabletop arcade. The screen is right in your face, clear as crystal. The speakers are powerful, but not so powerful that theyll annoy other patients. 
I played nearly 30 hours of Kingdom Hearts III on the Gaems Sentinel, forever linking the game and hardware in my mind. I pre-loaded the game on the Sentinel. I watched the countdown to unlocking on it. I fell asleep a half-hour before midnight, woke up and played the game in the morning following a very bland breakfast. 
Not only did I play Kingdom Hearts III, I got my Super Bowl Madden fix in, received my daily dose of Hatsune Miku and possibly played a few games I shouldnt have played in a room with nurses constantly coming and going.
One caveat: The Sentinel draws a lot of attention. Though Gaems has been making these portable monitor cases since 2011, not a lot of people seem to know they exist. At one point during my stay I had three nurses at once taking pictures of the unit. One wanted one for her kids to play with during family trips, which sounds a lot nicer than playing while recovering from surgery. Either way, the Sentinel was a lifesaver. 
Wired Controllers
Because calling your nurse into the room using a big red button with a cross on it to plug in your charging cable is dumb.
Wireless is best for when the television, PC or game console is far away, but wired is great when theyre a few feet from your face. Your controller stays charged, you know where it is, and if you drop it off the bed you can gingerly pull it back up. Its like controller fishing!
I opted to bring the Scuf Vantage with me to the hospital for a couple of reasons. Its the closest the PlayStation 4 has to an Xbox One Elite controller, made by the same company whose tech powers the Elite. Its highly versatile and programmable on-the-fly, so if I get an ache or numbness in my fingers, which has happened now and then since my spinal injury, I can use the triggers on the bottom with more capable digits. 
While my PlayStation 4 (and Kingdom Hearts III) was the focus of my hospital stay gaming, I managed to smuggle in a few additional ways to play. 
A Proper Gaming Laptop
Because you never know when youll be stuck in a hospital bed when the hottest new battle royale game launches. Apex Legends came out of nowhere during the second week of my stay. Thanks to my handy gaming laptop, I was able to load it, stare at the opening screen and then fearfully close it again. I am terrified of battle royale games, but dammit, I had the option to play, and that made all the difference.
Oh, and I guess I played a lot of Anthem as well.
The Nintendo Switch
If you own a Switch, its likely going with you wherever you are anyway. Can you see my Switch in this photo?
Its the red and yellow thing off to the right, because I am a fancy lad. I brought the dock with me in case I wanted to hook it up to the Sentinel, but it comes with a perfectly good screen of its own, so why bother. 
The Switch got a lot of play during my hospitalization. Sometimes the nurse and techs left without pushing the table back over my bed, and the Switch was all I had in reach. Then there was last Wednesdays Nintendo Direct presentation, in which games like Tetris 99 and the Yoshis Crafted World demo went live immediately. Thanks to including my Switch in my ridiculously large hospital bag, I was able to leap on those new games like some sort of gaming gazelle who leaps a lot.
Maybe One Of These
As long as theres a new Etrian Odyssey game to play, the 3DS family is still alive, no matter what Ethan says. Have you played Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowsers Inside Story? So good. 
Assorted Sundries
While those lovely bits of hardware are the main reason I survived nearly a month of laying flat in the hospital without freaking out, I couldnt have done it without these additional bits of kit: 
Extension cordhospital power outlets arent always convenient. 
Power stripyou can never have enough places to plug things.
Angled laptop standbecause its hard to type when you are lying flat in a bed. 
Lightweight headphonesbecause no one else needs to hear your games.
A screwdriverbecause I knocked my trackball off the table and had to repair it.
Snacksbecause hospital food is gross. 
Gaming Can Go Anywhere These Days
Whether you are sequestered in a luxury hotel, stuck at an airport or looking for something to do between hospital food and bed baths, gaming doesnt need to be left behind. With the right gear, you can turn a bogus journey into an excellent adventure. 
Unless they make you lie face-down. Then youre kind of screwed.","From January 23 through February 18 I was confined to a hospital bed, recovering from a surgical procedure that required me to remain almost completely prone in order to heal.

ROSS DOUTHAT and DAVID FRUM,"DOUTHAT: That the Russians have gained a president who may be seriously endangering America’s broad position in the world I don’t dispute. My argument is just that, so far, your intelligent South Korean could look at the actual moves made by the American state and persuade themselves — as many world leaders have seemingly persuaded themselves — that they should act as though McMaster and James Mattis and a few others are really running foreign policy, and the official president’s tweets are so much sound and fury. Likewise an intelligent Pole or Hungarian or Ukrainian, trying to make choices in the shadow of Putin’s ambitions: You just don’t see the kind of dramatic steps, with NATO or anything else, that would suggest that Trump is substantially changing American policy. Which is why despite our agreement about Trump’s character and competence, my general level of alarm has lowered somewhat since his inauguration, and is currently lower than your own. FRUM: The United States is a big bureaucratic state. Change more often comes to the United States by changing the content of the American state than by changing its forms. For example, the Constitution contemplates a cabinet system of government, with the principal officers confirmed by the Senate. Yet the chief of staff and the national security adviser, two positions never contemplated by the Constitution, matter more than any cabinet officer. On constitutional democracy’s periodic upswings, we develop expectations about how the president should behave that exceed the law — e.g., no Franklin Roosevelt Jr.’s doing shady deals from the White House — and we go into reverse on the downswing. Trump has not changed any law or policy about presidential financial integrity. He’s just ignored customs (publish his tax returns), rendered other laws meaningless (financial disclosures that conceal things the public most needs to know, e.g., the upstream debts of the Trump Organization) and simply defied other laws by official lying (the endless misstatements by Trump’s son-in-law and the nation’s de facto chief foreign affairs officer). DOUTHAT: I agree; this is a definite downswing, a return of certain kinds of presidential sordidness and their exacerbation on certain fronts. But part of what’s been striking about the Trump era to me is how much its events have confirmed trends that are bigger than Trump, that he benefited from during his ascent and that loom larger to me as symptoms of continuing crisis than most of the specific policy moves he’s attempted. In particular, the paralysis of Congress, it’s abdication of power to the presidency and its inability to function as a legislative body — plus the ideological sclerosis of the Republican Party, its collapse into an entertainment-wing-driven grift — these have been defining features of life under President Trump, as they were under President Obama before him. Were Trump an effective authoritarian, he could use these features of our politics to claim new powers and execute unilaterally on grand ambitions — as both of the last two presidents, on matters of war and peace and domestic policy, attempted and sometimes succeeded in doing. But his ineffectiveness so far means that the pre-existing crisis in how the presidency and the legislative branch relate to each other, and how the G.O.P. all functions, is still percolating, but not necessarily becoming dramatically more dire. FRUM: Your use of the word “unilaterally” casts a useful clarifying light on what may be the foundation of our disagreement. Let me be very clear what I do not mean by “Trumpocracy,” at least not yet: Caesarism. The authoritarian-nationalist system Trump is building is not being built against Congress, but with Congress — and even more, with Republican Parties at the state level. The big reveal to Republicans in the second Obama term, continuing now into the first Trump term, is that you and Reihan Salam and Ramesh Ponnuru and Henry Olsen and other “reformicons” were right on the politics of Paul Ryan-style conservatism: Such politics simply could not prevail in a free and fair democratic contest. You and they (and me, too) assumed, or at least hoped, that Paul Ryan’s party would respond to this better-late-than-never recognition of the obvious by moderating their policies. More health care, less immigration, more infrastructure, more family-friendly tax policy, etc. DOUTHAT: Right, and this is where I differ from many NeverTrumpers: On policy grounds, there is a sense in which I often wish that Trump were more effective in pushing the populist-nationalist brew from his campaign. Instead, those ideas (especially their non-xenophobic, economic manifestations) seem like something he never much cared about and will happily abandon if everyone else in the room prefers to repeal Obamacare instead. FRUM: Instead, they concluded: “What if we shaped the electorate to be a little more friendly to us? Might our formerly unpopular ideas prevail then?” The G.O.P. is complicit with Trump because he delivered a success that finer leaders and better methods could not deliver. Trumpocracy is the fusion of Trump’s authoritarian instincts with the G.O.P.’s plutocratic instincts in the context of a country trending in very different directions. DOUTHAT: I think that’s a plausible characterization. But again, those instincts have not, so far, produced massive voter disenfranchisement — just a voter fraud commission that went nowhere because it was run by incompetents. More broadly, the G.O.P. is relying on gerrymandering and Electoral College quirks and the concentration of liberal voters around big cities — but that kind of thing often happens in American politics, and so far it’s not producing big policy swings (Paul Ryan is not going to privatize Medicare in the next two years), just stagnation and the status quo, with the clear opportunity for the Democrats to take control of all three branches of government if they run smart campaigns in the next two years. The underlying situation isn’t good, for the country or for a healthy conservatism — but neither is there some authoritarian breakthrough happening that’s likely to save the G.O.P. from its unpopularity, let alone enable it to implement some full-on anti-welfare state agenda. FRUM: If your concern is for a seizure of power like the 18th Brumaire, then yes, you can relax. That’s not going to happen. It hasn’t happened in Hungary, it hasn’t happened in Poland, it hasn’t happened in South Africa, it won’t happen here. It’s out of style, counterproductive. “Massive” voter disenfranchisement of the kind seen in the U.S. South after 1876 also won’t happen. It’s too visible and too provocative. Modern authoritarianism is more economical. It will — it has — produced just enough disenfranchisement to get the job done without so much as to rev up so many people as to threaten the whole project. DOUTHAT: Perhaps, but it seems its own sort of complacency to assume that we couldn’t ever have a an 18th Brumaire-style coup … and also like an overestimation of the Trumpian varietal if its “economical” voter suppression can’t even manage to hold a safe-as-houses Senate seat in Alabama. FRUM: But look at what has already happened. Donald Trump fired an F.B.I. director for blatantly improper, self-serving reasons — and his entire party (and its supporting talkers on TV and radio and the op-ed pages) instantly coalesced on a brand-new theory that the president has an absolute discretionary right to fire the F.B.I. director at any time for any reason, including to protect himself from investigation. Nobody ever believed that before — indeed, the last time a president fired an F.B.I. director, Bill Clinton versus William Sessions, the president engaged in elaborate fact-finding and broad consultations with Congress and extended the director the opportunity to testify on his own behalf. And all this with Congress controlled by the president’s own party! Today, it’s the newly declared position of one of the parties (and who knows, maybe soon both parties) that the chief law enforcement officer of the United States is subject to presidential control and direction and removal for any reason, including self-dealing reasons. This is new. And it is dangerous. DOUTHAT: I’m not sure we’re quite there: Your “brand new theory” is the declared position of Sean Hannity and other Fox personalities and a clutch of noisy House Republicans, but so long as the Mueller investigation is proceeding apace, I think it’s more a norm in the balance, if you will. But I won’t argue that Trump isn’t a norm violator. I’m just not sure, in the absence of sweeping policy consequences, that his sleazy, sordid norm busting is categorically worse than, say, the way that both the Bush and the Obama White House changed norms about going after reporters and leakers, or the norm shifting after 9/11 that led to torture briefly being practiced by the C.I.A., or the norm shifting that gave us a disastrous Libya intervention that Congress never even voted on ever … let alone President Obama’s various norm-stretching power grabs on immigration, climate-change regulations and more. FRUM: As you know, I open my book by discussing the “pre-existing conditions” from which Trump emerged. My hypothesis is that the end of the Cold War opened the way to more uncertainty about America’s responsibilities abroad and more ruthless partisan competition at home. But it’s not a very reassuring answer to the complaint “We seem to have fallen to new low” to point out that we have been tumbling downstairs for a while. DOUTHAT: That’s fair, but if the danger was taking a header off the landing, and instead we’ve just rolled down a step or two, I’m not going to apologize for feeling a provisional relief. But to play us out here, let me test a thought I’ve had sometimes in the last year: We’ve been talking about the trend toward “Caesarism,” something I criticized harshly under Obama and feared Trump would exacerbate. But sometimes during the last year I’ve wondered if the “pre-existing conditions” are now bad enough that there simply isn’t going to be, say, a recovery of congressional effectiveness or a return to a healthy left-right dynamic without a kind of Caesarist interlude, of the kind America arguably had under Lincoln and under F.D.R., in which a dangerously strong president reshapes his party and the political process in ways that make it possible to pursue the common good again. In other words, Trump is the wrong kind of Caesar, but some version of what he represents, some authoritarianism-skirting leader, might in fact be a necessary figure for our polarized and increasingly dysfunctional politics. What do you think of that provocation? FRUM: Lincoln and F.D.R. expanded the presidency in ways that Donald Trump has not yet attempted, and is probably too idle, distracted and inept to execute. Lincoln and F.D.R. were also good and decent men — Lincoln, in fact, something high above ordinary ideas of goodness and decency — facing authentic emergencies and acting for the public good in ways not only ratified by history but also by the leading moral authorities of their own time. What you say above may describe the impending Oprah presidency, but not Trump’s. DOUTHAT: Well, then let’s discuss again under the spiritual-but-not-religious theocracy of Her Most Holy Oprahness. Thank you, David. It was a pleasure. FRUM: Thank you — and even more urgently let me finish with a wish that events prove you right and me wrong.

You get less adventurous, fall into comfortable routines with significant others, and you don’t have school to force you to interact with different groups of people anymore. But if you have at least one friend, you do have an easy option for finding some fresh faces to spend time with. Friends make you happy, healthy, and they’ll be there for you when the rain starts to pour. But how … Read more Read When we think of our friends, we tend to think of them as just our friends. Obviously, this is rarely the case. Your friends have friends of their own. If you’re feeling lonely, or you feel like you don’t have enough friends in your inner circle, Amie Harwick, licensed marriage and family therapist, suggests at The Cut that you should use the friends you have as a resource to network. Ask your current friends for friend referrals, as if they’re a good doctor you trust to know what’s best for you. Think about it—the things you have in common with your current friend are probably some of the same things they have in common with their other friends. Have them set you up with someone they know that you don’t (your friend can come along if you’re uncomfortable). It might not work out—sometimes friend groups stay separate for a reason—but you could hit it off and have a new buddy just like that. This approach worked extremely well for me when I moved to a new city several years ago. I met a someone through an old friend I’d known for a very long time, and we eventually grew close enough to become travel buddies—all because I asked my friend “Hey, do you have so-and-so’s number?

DOUGLAS JACOBS,"Housing assistance via the federal Housing Choice Voucher, formerly known as Section 8, makes rent affordable and helps families avoid homelessness, putting parents in a better position to secure permanent employment. Low-income subsidies for Medicare Part D make medication more affordable, and studies have demonstrated that reduced medication costs are associated with better adherence to treatment and improved health outcomes. It should come as no surprise, then, that people who take their prescribed medicines also have fewer missed days of work and less reliance on short-term disability. Medicaid itself has been associated with a reduction in mortality, with a recent estimate predicting one life saved annually for every 239 to 316 adults gaining insurance. While the benefits of these public assistance programs seem clear, even if one rejected this research we have a moral obligation to provide basic human services to legal immigrants. We shouldnt shroud the truth: The regulation will physically harm immigrants. It will also inflict pain on their children, who may have the most to lose as their parents are pushed to partly forfeit health care, nutrition and shelter assistance. One in four children ( 19 million in all) in this country has immigrant parents, and nearly nine in 10 of these children are citizens. Even without the rule going into effect, the fear surrounding it has magnified the calamity. In 18 states, nearly two-thirds of licensed providers for the federal Women, Infants and Children nutrition program have reported already seeing a decline in caseloads, some by as much as 20 percent. If this rule is put into effect, one million immigrants are expected to drop Medicaid. To be clear, no immigrant should remove himself from public assistance programs, at least until the rule is made final, and we still have several steps before that would become a reality. And immigrants, even with the rule, would still be allowed a paltry 12 months of Medicaid in a three-year period before being labeled public charges. But this fear, stoked by our president and carried out by brutal regulations, may cause immigrants like my patients to shy away from the governments helping hand for decades to come. During the health care debates in 2010, opponents of expanding coverage frequently spoke about reform getting in the way of the doctor-patient relationship. What they dont seem to understand is that my relationship with my patients is predicated on their ability to get insurance coverage like Medicaid. My ability to prescribe medications to treat diseases for the elderly is dependent on Medicare Part D. And my counsel about healthy food will fall on deaf ears if nutritional assistance is forgone. Our government should not torture our nations must vulnerable immigrants by forcing them to choose between their citizenship status and their health. Immigrants should not have to give up food, shelter and health care to pursue the American dream.

Andrew Liptak,"When J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens hit theaters in 2015, it was no surprise that moviegoers came away with lots of questions. Abrams — known for series like Lost and Alias — is notoriously fond of mystery, which he calls “the catalyst for imagination.” In a 2007 TED Talk, he presented a box he bought as a kid, and still hadn’t opened decades later — because unopened, it represented “infinite possibility.” The Force Awakens suggested a similar infinite possibility, in a universe where 30 years had passed since the death of Darth Vader and the Emperor. The time jump opened up endless opportunities. And though the film returned to the same basic pattern as the first Star Wars, with new versions of the Empire, the Rebellion, and Luke Skywalker, the film still ended with a pile of open-ended mysteries that obsessed fans. Why did Luke Skywalker go into exile? Who were Rey’s parents? Who was Supreme Leader Snoke, and how did he start the First Order? Over the next two years, fan theories filled these gaps. Maybe Snoke was really the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis — or maybe he was Jar Jar Binks, or Mace Windu, or the Emperor reincarnated. Meanwhile, Rey was definitely a long-lost twin sister of Ben Solo. Or was she a daughter of Obi-Wan Kenobi? Fans hoped Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi might resolve these mysteries. And it certainly addressed some of them. But inevitably, the answers about Rey’s parentage didn’t please everyone, and the lack of answers about Snoke didn’t seem to please anyone. Still, Johnson’s approach doesn’t weaken The Last Jedi. It helps it succeed as a film. Spoilers for The Last Jedi ahead. Blockbuster franchises tend to use each major film as an incremental building block toward a larger goal. Abrams anticipates this in The Force Awakens, sprinkling in seeds for other stories meant to fill in the gaps. But there are downsides to this approach. Marvel’s Cinematic Universe sometimes feels as though its individual entries are just placeholders or advertisements for the next big team-up film, or the next big series revelation. And as franchises get deep into their planned stories, the staleness of a familiar story can dampen the audience’s excitement. In a post-release interview with Entertainment Weekly, Johnson explained his attitude toward setting up a new story and going against expectations. “The easiest thing for Rey and the audience to hear is, ‘Oh yeah, you’re so-and-so’s daughter.’ That would be wish fulfillment and instantly hand her a place in this story on a silver platter,” he said. By focusing the film extensively on Luke’s redemption, Johnson cuts against many of the expectations Abrams — and the entire history of Star Wars — prepared for fans. The now-non-canon Expanded Universe frequently put the Skywalker and Solo families in the center of major galaxy events, and Abrams seemed to tee up a similar dynamic: teasing Rey’s mysterious past, giving her visions when she touched Luke Skywalker’s long-lost lightsaber, setting up the expectation that she was part of a larger familiar story. Fans eagerly dug into those hints. But as improbable as it seems, Lucasfilm seems to have given Johnson carte blanche to decide who Rey’s parents were, how to address Snoke, and what story to tell in general. He appears to have used this freedom to avoid letting Abrams paint him into a corner. Johnson pushes back against many Star Wars conventions: he downplays the importance of Rey’s heritage, ignores Snoke’s backstory, reintroduces a broken Luke Skywalker, and pits Poe Dameron against a military leader who doesn’t reward the usual rash tactics of the Rebellion’s pilots. Instead, Johnson uses one of The Force Awakens ’ biggest lingering questions to inform his story. How did Luke Skywalker end up on an island on a remote planet? The answer is tragic: even as a hero, Luke can make horrifying decisions. In a moment of weakness, he considered murdering his own nephew, which sets up an intriguing redemption arc at the movie’s core. The entire story bucks fan expectations. Tasked with relaunching the franchise to an audience wary of Star Wars films after the prequel trilogy, Abrams played it safe by returning to the franchise’s basic building blocks. But if Star Wars films keep borrowing from the past, they’ll inevitably take on that franchise staleness, that sense of spinning wheels. Disney has plans to continue the franchise for at least another decade, which means the story needs new directions. If Johnson had played by Abrams’ rules (which are ultimately George Lucas’ rules), fans might have received The Last Jedi more warmly — at least, the fans who’ve been most vocal in their complaints. But then the film would have been a placeholder in the middle of a trilogy, rather than pushing Star Wars ’ boundaries. Disney has already experimented with giving directors full control of Marvel movies. Look at this year’s Thor: Ragnarok, or the first Guardians of the Galaxy, both of which let idiosyncratic directors play with well-established worlds in unexpected ways. Johnson follows suit. At times, it feels as though he’s gently trolling his audience by setting up a scene we’ve seen before, then pulling back to play out the scene in another way, such as disguising an iron as a spaceship, having Leia shoot Poe after his short-lived mutiny, or setting up a dramatic reveal of Rey’s parents, only to show her looking at herself in a mirror. By ignoring the obvious paths Abrams set up, Johnson genuinely surprised his viewers, for better or worse. And fighting the most obvious and familiar story paths is the right direction for the franchise. He decouples Rey’s story from that of the Skywalker saga, concludes Luke’s story, and ultimately puts the fate of the galaxy into the hands of lost kids like Rey. By challenging expectations for the film, Johnson shakes things up and takes the franchise’s iconic heroes out of a safe place to look at them in a new light. That new examination and reinvention is exactly what Star Wars and Disney need. Fans may fight it at first, as they so often fight anything outside the scope of what made them love a franchise in the first place. But the only way to bring Star Wars back to that place of infinite possibilities is to defy expectations. Viewers may quibble about Johnson’s specific answers to Abrams’ questions, but they shouldn’t be so quick to resent him answering them in ways they didn’t expect.",A new examination and reinvention is exactly what Star Wars needs,2017-12-22T19:09:03Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","Star Wars: The Last Jedi rejects The Force Awakens’ mysteries, and is better for it",https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/22/16787554/star-wars-the-last-jedi-rey-snoke-parents-questions-mysteries-rian-johnson-jj-abrams,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tob7zqQTaUJUe_ST30aj2KW07Ks=/0x114:1600x952/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9918877/39195024092_a863cb3cae_h.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,force,1

The heads of the CIA, FBI and NSA told a Senate committee in February they didn't recommend products or services by China's Huawei or ZTE be used by Americans, concerned about companies or entities becoming ""beholden to foreign governments."" SEE ALSO: China banned the letter 'N' from Weibo and WeChat Now, in Australia, that suspicion has seemingly extended to Chinese apps. Messaging platform WeChat has reportedly been banned from being installed on phones belonging to the country's Department of Defence, according to the Australian Financial Review. ""Defence does not provide or support the use of unauthorised software, including the WeChat social media application, on Defence mobile devices,"" a Defence spokesperson told the newspaper. Limited use of Facebook is reportedly allowed though. It comes amid concerns of heightened Chinese espionage activities within the country, although Defence didn't specify why it banned WeChat, owned by internet company Tencent. Mashable has contacted the department for comment. Back in December, India's Defence Ministry instructed its armed forces to uninstall WeChat, one of 42 apps it listed, after reporting a number of the apps had ""spyware or other malicious ware."" ""Use of these apps by our force personnel can be detrimental to data security having implications on the force and national security,"" read a memo published by the Indian Express. In a 2016 report, Amnesty International ranked WeChat and other Tencent apps lowest in a privacy assessment of popular messaging apps. WeChat scored zero of 100, due to its lack of end-to-end encryption and failure to recognise threats or protect freedom of expression. The app remains dominant in China, however, and is set to be integrated with the nation's electronic ID system.","Last month, U.S. intelligence agencies weren't so into the idea of people using Chinese phones.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The storm passed through the capital Lisbon Hurricane-force winds have brought down hundreds of trees and left more than 15,000 homes without power in Portugal. The remnants of Hurricane Leslie swept into the centre and north of the country overnight on Saturday. There have been no reports of deaths or injuries, but officials have warned people not to venture outdoors, and a number of flights have been cancelled. The storm, one of the most powerful to ever hit the country, is now heading for Spain. Wind speeds of up to 176km/h (109mph) were recorded after the storm struck the mainland. It is rare for an Atlantic hurricane to reach the Iberian Peninsula, and it is thought this could be the most powerful to hit Portugal since 1842. However, Hurricane Leslie, which formed on 23 September, was downgraded to a tropical storm before it made landfall. Portugal's civil protection chief Luis Belo Costa warned of possible flooding in coastal areas ahead of the storm's arrival.","The remnants of Hurricane Leslie left more than 15,000 homes without power after striking overnight.",2018-10-14T03:14:33Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Storm Leslie: Portugal hit by hurricane-force winds,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45853847,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/67C5/production/_103856562_aa8ad2cc-e15d-4c18-8620-77790ea21cc3.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,force,1
Zack Whittaker,"Homeland Security’s supply chain task force is finally off the ground.. The public-private coalition, set up earlier this year, now has representatives from more than two dozen companies and industry groups signed up to help the government try to combat risks faced by tech companies from threats in the supply chain. Called the ICT Supply Chain Task Force, government officials hope to better understand to address security issues with global technology supply chains and make recommendations. By collaborating, the group aims to better understand the risks that companies face from industrial espionage, government interference, and other cybersecurity issues that could pose a threat to U.S national security. One of those new members is Cisco’s Edna Conway, chief security officer for its global value chain. She told TechCrunch that enterprises and governments “can no longer effectively identify, defend against and mitigate the risks across that global value chain in isolation.” She, like others, have called for a group effort to tackle the threats they face. The task force couldn’t come soon enough. Although the government has long known of supply chain threats, the group’s official formation comes in the aftermath of Bloomberg’s controversial claims that Chinese intelligence had infiltrated the server hardware supply chain that with tiny chips. Bloomberg’s claims have been largely debunked or not proven to the standard that many have called for. But it doesn’t diminish the long-known threat that the U.S. electronics and data industries face. By working together, the task force aims to to create policy recommendations that would incentivize businesses to buy hardware and software directly from original vendors and vetted resellers to reduce the risk of having an unknown, untrusted third-party in the mix. One of the end goals is to ensure that only the trusted vendors, which stick to a strict set of criteria laid out by the task force, will be qualified to bid for contracts. “Cisco brings to the task force this collaborative spirit, a deep understanding of the operation of global ICT value chains and my expertise in shifting security and risk from ‘limiting damage’ to key enabler of business differentiation,” said Conway. Cisco joins other tech giants and major telcos at the table, including Accenture, AT&amp;T, CenturyLink, Charter, Comcast, CTIA, CyberRx, Cybersecurity Coalition, Cyxtera, FireEye, Intel, ITI, IT-ISAC, Microsoft, NAB, NCTA, NTCA, Palo Alto Networks, Samsung, Sprint, Threat Sketch, TIA, T-Mobile, US Telecom and Verizon ( which, as a reminder, owns TechCrunch ). They will be joined by representatives from Homeland Security, the Defense Dept., the Justice Dept., the Treasury, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, among others in government. Homeland Security under secretary Christopher Krebs said that by bringing together representatives from the public and private sector, the task force has “a unique ability to confront today’s challenges by sharing information across government and industry in real-time and developing the ability to better plan for the risks of the future.”","Homeland Security’s supply chain task force is finally off the ground..

Natasha Lomas,"The UK’s Department for Transport has said today that an expansion of drone ‘no-fly’ zones to 5km around airport runways will come into force on March 13.
Anyone caught and convicted of flying a drone inside the restricted zones could face a fine and years in prison.
Last month the government said it would tighten restrictions on drones flights around airports, after the existing 1km limit was criticized for being inadequate — saying it believes expanded no-fly zones will help protect airports from drone misuse.
The 1km drone exclusion zone around airports, and a 400ft drone flight height restriction rule, only came into force last July. But ministers came in for sharp criticism following the Gatwick Airport drone fiasco when a spate of drone sightings near the UK’s second busiest airport caused a temporary shutdown of the runway and travel disruption for thousands of people right before Christmas.
Heathrow, the UK’s busiest airport, also briefly halted departures after further sightings of drones last month.
“The law is clear that flying a drone near an airport is a serious criminal act. Were now going even further and extending the no-fly zone to help keep our airports secure and our skies safe,” said transport secretary, Chris Grayling, in a statement today.
“We are also working to raise awareness of the rules in place. Anyone flying their drone within the vicinity of an airport should know they are not only acting irresponsibly, but criminally, and could face imprisonment.”
The government and the Civil Aviation Authority have announced a partnership with online retailer Jessops to help raise public awareness about the new drone rules — and encourage what they dub “responsible drone use” — as part of a national awareness campaign.
The government also said work is continuing on a new Drones Bill. Although the planned legislation is already almost a year behind schedule — and is still only slated for introduction “in due course”.
The bill will give police officers powers to stop and search people suspected of using drones maliciously above 400ft or within 5km of an airport, the government said.
It added that the planned legislation will give additional new powers to the police to clamp down on those misusing drones and other small unmanned aircraft, including the power to access electronic data stored on a drone with a warrant.
Additional powers for police were trailed back in 2017 when the drone bill was first floated by the government. It re-announced its intention to beef up police powers to tackle drone misuse last month following the Gatwick fiasco.
The government added today that the Home Office is still reviewing the UK’s approach to countering the malicious use of drones, writing that it will “consider how best to protect the full range of the UKs critical national infrastructure — including testing and evaluating technology to counter drones”.

Rhett Allain,"I've never been surfing—but I'm willing to give it a try. I would not, however, be interested in attempting to surf a massive wave like this one off the coast of Portugal. That's a pass for me. Of course even if you don't surf, there is still some cool physics involved in the act of surfing (let alone all the physics of wave formation). So, how does a rider stay moving with a huge wave like this? As with all motions, the key is to look at forces. Here's a diagram showing the forces on a surfer moving at a constant speed on a wave. Remember that these forces all have to add up in a way to make zero net force. If there is a non-zero net force on the surfer then there would also be an acceleration (that is the nature of forces). But what are these three forces? The most obvious is the gravitational force. This is the downward pulling force that results from the mass of the surfer and the Earth interacting. It's a cool force, but since neither the masses nor the distances between the objects change—this force is also constant. The next force to consider is the drag force. As the surf board moves through the water, there is some resistance. This resistance is like a frictional force in the opposite direction of motion and parallel to the surface of the water. Notice that the water for this wave is not horizontal—since it's, you know, a wave. I assume the magnitude of this drag force would increase with an increase in surfer speed. The last force is the one I have labeled as ""water."" Yes, I am cheating here. Technically the ""drag"" force is also from the water, but I didn't know what else to call this. The important point is that this component of the force from the water is perpendicular to the surface of the water instead of parallel (like the drag force). It comes from a combination of buoyancy and a type of ""lift"" as the board moves through the water. This water force prevents the board from ""sinking"" into the wave. Add up all these forces and the surfer moves at a constant speed. But wait: It gets more complicated. In order to see the problem, I will draw a slightly more detailed force diagram—but the surfer will just be a dot. Consider the line parallel to the water. I will call this the x-axis. There are two forces pushing in this x-direction. There is the drag force and then there is a component of the gravitational force. As the wave gets steeper (greater value of θ) there is a larger component of the gravitational force in the direction down the wave. In terms of the gravitational force (mass multiplied by the gravitational field—g) and the wave angle, the following must be true for constant velocity. So, a steeper wave means a greater ""forward"" pushing force which would speed up the surfer. But a greater speed probably means a greater drag force. This means that for a given wave angle, there is only one surfer speed that will give a particular velocity. That's important because you probably want to be traveling at the same speed as the wave—that's the whole point of this sport called ""surfing."" Oh, I should point out that in this example the wave and the surfer are moving in different directions—the wave is moving horizontally, but the water in the wave moves in complicated ways. Thus it seems there should be a particular spot on the wave for a surfer to ""catch the wave."" If a surfer is moving too fast for a wave, there is always another option—turn. If a surfer moves perpendicular to the direction the wave moves, the speed in the direction of the wave is much lower. I guess (reminder: not an actual surfer) this is why they travel along the length of the wave. This is likely doubly true for wave that's as giant and steep as this one in Portugal. I still would be afraid to even be near this type of a wave.

HELENE COOPER,"But that was before the president abruptly announced in June that he wanted a space force. On Thursday, introducing Mr. Pence, Mr. Mattis said that space “is becoming a contested war-fighting domain and we have to adapt to that reality.” The Pentagon unveiled a report with steps that would be necessary to create a space force, known as United States Space Command. The Pentagon recommended that the space force initially be under the purview of the Air Force. Proponents of a Space Force argue that the Air Force does not pay enough attention to outer space. What’s more, they say, Russia and China are developing antisatellite weapons that could pose a threat to American satellites. “We could be deaf, dumb and blind within seconds,” Rep. Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee and an advocate of the idea, told a February space forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Seldom has a great nation been so vulnerable.”","Once reluctant, Defense Secretary Mattis is now on board with the plan.",2018-08-09T19:11:37Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Pence Advances Plan to Create a Space Force,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/us/politics/trump-pence-space-force.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/10/us/politics/10dc-space-video/merlin_142158108_42590454-f89d-4b6a-a70e-4a7a5c3a7b58-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1
Rhett Allain,"This is a cooler physics problem than I initially realized. It goes something like this. A block has a mass of 1 kg and is placed on a vertical wall such that the coefficient of static friction is 0.5. With what magnitude force do you need to push on the block perpendicular to the wall to keep the block from falling? Here, a picture will help. Let's do this. I will start with a force diagram. There are four forces acting on this block: downward gravitational force, the force from the push, a frictional force, and a normal force from the wall. As a force diagram, it would look like this. Since this block is in equilibrium (at rest with zero acceleration), the net vector force must be zero Newtons. This means the net force in the x direction and the net force in the y direction must be zero. What forces are acting in the y direction? It's just the gravitational force and the frictional force. Yes, the magnitude of the frictional force must be equal to the weight. The friction is in the vertical direction because it is parallel to the wall (which is vertical). But how do you increase the friction force so that it's enough to keep the block from falling? In a basic model of friction, the magnitude of this force depends on two things: the types of materials interacting and the force with which they're pushed together. You can't really change the types of material in the block and the wall—but you can control the force with which they're pushed together. In the diagram above, this force is the normal force (labeled as N). In general, we can write this friction model as the following: So the pushing force ( F above) increases the normal force ( N ) and this normal force increases the friction force to balance the weight. I'll skip the rest of the steps (you should do this for homework), but in the end, the minimum force (which uses the maximum friction) would be: Does this answer even make sense? Yes. First, it has the right units (units of Newtons) since the coefficient of static friction is unitless and m g* is in Newtons. Second, this says that with a greater coefficient of friction, you don't have to push so hard. That makes sense. But really, this problem is just a warm-up. How about something better? Next question. What if I take the same block and push up at an angle? Like this: Would I have to push harder or not as hard to keep the block up? Go ahead and make a prediction. OK, now let's do it. Again, I will start with a force diagram. It's pretty much the same as before except that pushing force is at an angle. Except that it's not the same. Some cool things happen. First, since the force is pushing at an angle the x component decreases. This means the normal force also decreases, which decreases the frictional force. However, that's OK since the force now has a vertical component too. With this force diagram, I can again write down the sum of the forces in the x and y directions. I will skip most of the steps (so that you can do it for homework), but here is what I get for the magnitude of the force pushing at an angle (I also used the friction model from above). That's nice. Right? But again, we should check this equation. Does it have the correct units? Yes—the denominator of this expression just has μ s and trig functions which do not have units. This means that overall the expression has units of Newtons. That's good. What would happen if I push with an angle of zero degrees? Putting in zero for θ in this expression I get the same answer as the first question (pushing horizontal)—so that makes sense. Finally, what if I push straight up with θ equal to 90 degrees? This would give a force magnitude equal to the weight of the block—again, that seems reasonable. But wait! What about the answer to the question about pushing horizontal compared to pushing at an angle? Which requires more force? As long as the angle is between 0 and 90 degrees, the stuff in the denominator will be bigger than just μ s such that the force will be smaller at an angle. Is there a ""best"" angle that requires the least amount of force? Yes! Let's find it. Of course you could take the equation for the force as a function of θ above and take the derivative with respect to θ and then set it equal to zero. This would be your standard max-min problem from calculus class. What if I just sort of use brute force to solve this problem? I can calculate the force required and a bunch of different angles and then just find the angle with the smallest force. Since I don't actually want to do this by hand—I will use Python. And here is that program (so that you can play with it too). Just push the Run button to run it and then you can go back and edit the code if you want to play with it. Don't worry, you can't really break anything. This is a fairly straightforward program. But the cool part is that there is a minimum pushing force at some angle. It's easier to see with larger values for the coefficient of friction, so in the code above, I have it set at 0.6. With this value, a push angle of about 59.9° gives the lowest possible force. This force is lower than pushing it horizontal and lower than pushing straight up. In fact, every angle gives a lower force than pushing it horizontal. What happens as you change the coefficient of friction? Just for fun, I made the program a little bit more complicated so that I can create this plot. ( Here's the code if you want it ) I don't care what you think. This is cool. See, you thought it was a boring physics problem, but you were wrong. Oh, what is this good for in real life? It doesn't matter. I still think it's awesome. Homework Other than playing around with the code, I just have one homework question for you. Given the same values for mass and the coefficient of static friction and pushing angle—what is the maximum force you can push on the block before it slides up ? Hint: you will need to change the direction of the frictional force. Also, you should try changing the angle and see what happens—you know... for fun.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media captionBBC captures footage of post-election violence in Harare
Zimbabwe's military used ""unjustifiable"" force against opposition protesters in the wake of this year's presidential election, an inquiry has found.
Six people were killed after troops intervened to curb protests in the capital, Harare, on 1 August.
The independent commission said the army had acted disproportionately when it fired on fleeing demonstrators.
But it blamed some opposition figures for inciting the violence.
The army and police clashed with demonstrators who took to the streets amid allegations that the ruling Zanu-PF party had rigged the 30 July vote.
""The commission's finding is that the deaths of those six people arose from the action of the military and the police,"" a summary of the final report reads.
""The use of live ammunition directly at people especially while they were fleeing was clearly unjustified and disproportionate,"" it adds.
The seven-member commission, which was set up by President Emmerson Mnangagwa following his narrow victory, found the deployment of the military to have been legal.
It also accused the opposition MDC Alliance of enflaming tensions, citing speeches from some of its leaders.
""Had the riots not been checked the situation could have escalated resulting in disastrous consequences,"" it said.

On Tuesday, Mr Mnanagagwa said he would """"study the recommendations and decide the way forward"".
""I am satisfied that the commission of inquiry diligently carried out its mandate,"" he added.
But the opposition immediately dismissed the report and said the government was trying to ""whitewash"" the actions of the military.
""Our view is that they are... making a false equivalence between the demonstrators and those who were shooting unarmed protesters using bullets and guns,"" an MDC spokesman said.

Rachel Becker,"On Monday, President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to create a sixth branch of the Armed Forces: a Space Force. But the process of creating a new military service is more complicated than simply telling the Pentagon to make it so. Trump’s announcement came during a meeting with the National Space Council, shortly before he signed Space Policy Directive-3. The directive aims to keep satellite, space stations, and debris from careening into each other as they orbit the Earth at tens of thousands of miles per hour. It’s not something the US can do alone. In fact, the directive acknowledges that “spaceflight safety is a global challenge” and pledges to emphasize “the need for international transparency and [space traffic management] data sharing.” “That’s a big statement.” So the real reason Trump was talking about space had nothing to do with a Space Force. But he nevertheless took the opportunity to direct the Pentagon to create one, citing national identity and national security. “When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space,” he said. He told the Defense Department “to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the armed forces. That’s a big statement,” he said. To effectively coordinate space traffic requires international cooperation. So bombastically declaring America must dominate space sent mixed messages to the international community, according to Brian Weeden, director of program planning for a space policy NGO called the Secure World Foundation. “I’m worried that the impromptu Space Force announcement has overshadowed the space traffic management release and is going to hinder US ability to do international outreach and cooperation on the space traffic management.” Trump didn’t exactly pioneer the idea that America must dominate space; that’s what the original space race was about. More recently, George W. Bush revived space nationalism in his 2006 national space policy. “It prompted a lot of angst because it took a very unilateral and nationalistic tone about what the US intended to do in space,” says Theresa Hitchens, a senior research associate at the University of Maryland’s Center for International Security Studies. And Russian and Chinese tests of what may have been anti-satellite weapons prompted a shift towards thinking of space as a warfighting domain near the end of the Obama administration, Weeden says. “Senior US military leaders started talking about space no longer being a sanctuary and conflict on earth extending into space,” Weeden says. “That happened before Trump came into office.” A Space Force doesn’t mean more space weapons Space is embedded in pretty much everything the military does, says Weeden. Drones are a prime example: GPS satellites guide the missiles they fire. Surveillance satellites keep watch and assess the damage. Without satellites, the military wouldn’t be able to use drones, “which are a huge part of the US military’s counter terrorism operations,” Weeden says. But a Space Force wouldn’t necessarily change US military presence in space — it would just change who’s in charge, and how it’s funded. “Many of the people commenting on this immediately assume that a Space Force means they intend to go develop a whole bunch of offensive space capabilities,” he says. “Creating a Space Force or a Space Corps does not mean that the US is going to develop more space weapons. It merely changes the organizational structure.” Right now, Air Force Space Command is mostly in charge of national security in space. They supervise launches, DoD satellites, and determine what to buy for military space. The National Reconnaissance Office also oversees surveillance satellites that are key for targeting weapons, and assessing the damage they inflict, according to the NRO website. Shifting those responsibilities, personnel, and budget to an entirely new military service would be a massive undertaking that would require Congress to change Title 10 — the code that says which services do what. That would mean shifting money under the overall defense budget, or appropriating new funds — which budget caps could complicate, Hitchens says. “So it’s not as simple as President Trump seems to think it is.” “So it’s not as simple as President Trump seems to think it is.” In a press briefing Monday, a reporter asked White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders whether the president believed that this could be done without approval from Congress. “We’re in the beginning stages of it and we’re going to work with the DoD and the other relevant parties to put it into place,” Sanders replied. The thing is, the DoD has already started looking into a space corps, at Congress’s request. Last June, the House Armed Services Committee tried to form the Space Corps. But key Defense officials were against it — including Defense Secretary James Mattis, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, and Joint Chiefs Chairman General Joseph Dunford, according to The Hill. (Trump directed Monday’s announcement at General Dunford, saying: “General Dunford, if you would carry that assignment out, I would be very greatly honored.”) “There is such a thing in Washington as death-by-study.” The proposal was eventually scrapped, and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 ordered a study, instead. The report, which is due in August, should “provide Congress with a roadmap to establish a separate military department responsible for national security space activities of the DoD.” Ordering the study may have been a stalling tactic, Hitchens says. “There is such a thing in Washington as death-by-study — where a study begets another study begets another study until eventually nothing happens,” she says. “My bets are on death-by-study winning in this particular situation.” In the meantime, the Space Force is a distraction, says Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association, in an email to The Verge. There are real security challenges when it comes to space, and conflict there is possible. What we should be doing instead of wasting energy on the Space Force is talking — both domestically and with other nations, Reif says. “At the very least we should be having a dialogue about what types of conduct we will and will not pursue in space and what we expect others to do and not do, and try to find common ground on these principles.” “What will cause a country to go to war, and what will cause it to escalate?” In fact, while Trump’s rhetoric about US dominance in space wasn’t anything new, it still could have international ripple effects, says Robert Farley, a professor at the University of Kentucky Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce. “It will justify the fears and warnings that people have in Beijing and Moscow about US dominance of space,” he says. “You’ll see them continue to work on stuff like anti-satellite weapons, and other sorts of capabilities that can disrupt the US ability to use space for its military.” That’s why developing rules of war for space is more important than a Space Force, Hitchens says. Right now, there’s too much we don’t know about how conflicts in space might unfold. “There isn’t a lot of understanding amongst countries who are getting into this game about what will cause a country to go to war, and what will cause it to escalate up the ladder all the way to nukes,” she says. A Space Force wouldn’t necessarily be destabilizing, but “we have an almost more dangerous situation now than in the Cold War,” she says. “And this is not going to help matters.”","During a meeting of the National Space Council, President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to create a sixth branch of the armed forces: a Space Force.

Rhett Allain,"Take a pencil, stretch out your arm and let go. We all know that the pencil will fall. OK, but what about dropping a bowling ball ? Is that the same thing? No wait! How about a watermelon dropped off a tall building? Why would you do that? I would do it to see it splat. Or maybe even more extreme, a human jumping out of an airplane. These examples could all be considered "" falling,"" but not every fall is the same. So let's get to this. Here is all the physics you need to know about falling things. Hold on to your seats. This is probably going to be more than you asked for. Don't worry, the math will (mostly) be at a simple level. Falling Without Air Resistance I'm going to talk about air resistance down below. However, I want to start with the simplest case of an object falling near the surface of the Earth that has a negligible air resistance force. Really, this simplification isn't just approximately true in many cases, it's also one of the key components of the nature of science. If we want to build a scientific model ( science is all about building models ) the best bet is to start off with something without extra complications. If you want to model a mass on a spring, assume the spring is massless. If you want to model a cow, you have to assume it's a sphere ( mandatory spherical cow joke ). These simplifications are the first step to building more complicated models. Is Gravity Constant? This is one thing that comes up quite a bit. People say that if you drop two objects of different mass, they have the same gravity. OK, the first problem is the word ""gravity""—what does that mean? It can mean many different things. The two most common meanings are: the gravitational force or the gravitational field. Let's start with the gravitational field. This is a measure of the gravitational effect due to an object with mass. Since the gravitational interaction is force between two masses, you can think of this as ""half"" of that interaction (with just one mass). If you have an object near the surface of the Earth, then that object will have a gravitational interaction depending on the Earth's gravitational field. Near the surface of the Earth, the gravitational field is represented by the symbol ""g"" and has a value of about 9.8 Newtons per kilogram. No. The value of ""g"" is not the acceleration due to gravity. Yes, it is true that 9.8 N/kg has the equivalent units of meters per second squared. It is also true that a free falling (no air resistance) object falls with an acceleration of 9.8 m/s 2 —but it's still just the gravitational field. It doesn't matter what object you put near the surface of the Earth, the gravitational field due to the Earth is constant and pointing towards the center of the Earth. Note: it's not actually constant. More on that below. What about the gravitational force? Here is a picture of two objects with different mass. If you hold these two objects up, it should be clear that the gravitational force pulling down is not the same. The big rock has a bigger mass and a bigger gravitational force. That small metal ball has a much, MUCH smaller mass and also a much smaller gravitational force. Yes, the gravitational force is also called the weight—those are the same things. But the mass is not the same as weight. Mass is a measure of how much ""stuff"" is in an object and weight is the gravitational force. Now to connect it all together. Here is the relationship between mass, weight, and gravitational field. Technically, this should be a vector equation—but I'm trying to keep it simple. However, you can see that since g is constant an increase in mass increases the weight. Force and Acceleration OK, so you drop an object with mass. Once you let go, there is only one force acting on it—the gravitational force. What happens to an object with a force acting on it? The answer is that it accelerates. Oh, I know what you are thinking. You want to say that ""it just falls"" and maybe it falls fairly fast. That isn't completely wrong—but if you were to measure it carefully, you would see that it actually accelerates. That means that the objects downward speed increases with time. Let's forget about falling object for a moment. What about a small car on a horizontal frictionless track with a fan pushing it? Like this: If I turn on the fan and release the car, it accelerates. There are two ways I can change the acceleration of this car. I could increase the force from the fan or I could decrease the mass. With just a single force on an object in one dimension, I can write the following relationship. This is what a force (or a net force) does to an object—it makes it accelerate. Please don't say forces make objects move. ""Move"" is a four letter word (that means it's bad). Saying an object ""moves"" isn't wrong, but it doesn't really give enough of a description. Let's just stick with saying the object accelerates. There are many, many more things that could be said about force and motion but this is enough for now. Why do objects fall at the same time? Now we can put together a bunch of stuff to explain falling objects. If you drop a bowling ball and a basketball from the same height, they will hit the ground at the same time. Oh, just in case you don't have ball experience—the bowling ball is MUCH more massive than the basketball. Maybe they hit the ground at the same time because they have the same gravitational force on them? Nope. First, they can't have the same gravitational force because they have different masses (see above). Second, let's assume that these two balls have the same force. With the same force, the less massive one will have a greater acceleration based on the force-motion model above. Here, you can see this with two fan carts. The closer one has a greater mass but the forces from the fans are the same. In the end, the less massive one ""wins"". No, the two objects with different mass hit the ground at the same time because they have different forces. If we put together the definition of the gravitational force (on the surface of the Earth) and the force-motion model, we get this: Since both the acceleration AND the gravitational depend on the mass, the mass cancels. Objects fall with the same acceleration—if and only if the gravitational force is the only force. But does the gravitational force decrease with height? Yes. The gravitational field is not constant. I lied. Your textbook lied. We lied to protect you. We aren't bad. But now I think you can handle the truth. The gravitational force is an interaction between two objects with mass. For a falling ball, the two objects with mass are the Earth and the ball. The strength of this gravitational force is proportional to the product of the two masses, but inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. As a scalar equation, it looks like this. A couple of important things to point out (since you can handle the truth now). The ""G"" is the universal gravitational constant. It's value is super tiny such that we don't really notice the gravitational interaction between everyday objects—the force is too small to notice. The other thing to look at is the ""r"" in the denominator. This is the distance between the centers of the two objects. Since the Earth is mostly spherically uniform in density, the ""r"" for an object near the surface of the Earth will be equal to the radius of the Earth with a value of 6371 kilometers (huge). So, what happens if you move 1 km above the surface of the Earth? The ""r"" goes from 6371 km to 6732 km—not a big change. Even if you go ALL the way up to the altitude of the International Space Station orbit (400 km), there isn't a crazy huge change. Here, I will show you with this plot of gravitational field vs. height above the surface. Oh, and here is the python code I used to make this —just in case you want it. For just about all ""dropping object"" situations, we can just assume the gravitational force is constant. But what about air resistance? OK, now we are getting into the fun stuff. What if you drop an object and you can't ignore the air resistance? Then we have a more complicated problem because there are now TWO forces on the falling object. There is the gravitational force (see all the stuff above) and there is also an air resistance force. As an object moves through the air, there is a force pushing in the opposite direction of motion. This force depends on: The object's speed. The size of the object. The shape of the object. The density of the air. The part that makes this complicated is the dependency of the air resistance on the speed of the object. Let's consider a falling object with significant air resistance. How about a ping pong ball? When I let go of this ball, it is not moving. This means there is zero air resistance force and only the downward gravitational force. This force causes the ball to increase in speed (in the downward direction)—but once the ball is moving, there is now air resistance force pushing up. This makes the net force a little bit smaller and thus a slighter increase in speed. Eventually the air drag and gravitational force have equal magnitudes. The ball then falls at a constant speed—this is called terminal velocity. Since the net force on a falling object with air resistance isn't constant, this is a pretty tough problem. Really, the only practical (OK, not really the only way) to model this is with a numerical calculation that breaks the motion into tiny steps during which the force is approximately constant. How about a model of a falling ping pong ball? Here you go. Click the ""pencil"" to see and edit the code and the ""play"" to run it. You can see that the ping pong ball almost reaches a constant speed after dropping a distance of 10 meters. I put a ""no air"" object in there for reference. If you want to see what happens if you change the mass—go ahead and change the code and re run it. It's fun. Do heavier objects fall faster? Now we get to the interesting question. If I drop two objects from the same height, does the heavier one hit the ground first? The answer is ""sometimes"". Let's look at three examples. Drop number 1: a basketball and bowling ball. Here is a slow motion view of this actual thing. If you ignore air resistance then these two objects have the same acceleration because they have different masses (see above). But why can you ignore the air resistance in this case? Looking at the basketball, it has a significant mass and size. However, it is moving fairly slowly during the fall. Even at the fastest part of this drop the force from air on the ball is super tiny compared to the gravitational force. Now, if you dropped it from a much higher starting point the ball would be able to get up to a speed where the air drag makes it fall slower than the bowling ball. Drop number 2: a small ball and a cardboard box top. Just to be clear, the mass of the cardboard is WAY higher than the ball. Here is the drop. Sorry, the ball is hard to see since it's small. Does the more massive object fall faster? Nope. In fact it's the lower mass that hits the ground first. It's not just mass that matters, it's the size that matters too. Even though the cardboard has a greater mass, it's surface area is also GIANT. This produces a significant air resistance force to make it hit the ground it a longer time. Drop number 3: two pieces of paper. Two sheets of paper are pretty much the same so that they should have the same mass. However, they can hit the ground at different times. I tricked you. Both papers have the same mass, but by crumpling one up they have different surface areas. The crumpled up paper hits the ground first. It seems like this could be a good party trick. But again, it's about more than just the mass of the object. What about different sized skydivers? Two people jump out of an airplane (with parachutes because they aren't crazy). One person is large and one person is small. Which one falls with the greatest terminal velocity? Yes, you can assume they are both in standard free fall position (same shape). I am going to invoke the ""spherical cow"" principle and look at two falling spherical humans instead. Human 1 is a sphere with a radius of 1 meter (yes, that would be huge) and human 2 has a radius twice the size with a radius of 2 meters. How do the gravitational forces on these two spherical humans compare? Human 2 is obviously heavier. If the human density is constant, then the increase in gravitational force will be proportional to the increase in volume. If you double the radius of a sphere, you increase the volume by a factor of eight (volume is proportional to radius cubed). So human 2 has a weight 8 times that of human 1. What about the air resistance on these two humans? Again, human 2 will have a bigger area and more air resistance. If you double the radius, the cross sectional area will be four times as much (since area is proportional to radius squared). Now you see that the bigger human will have a greater terminal velocity. Human 2 has a weight that is 8 times as much but air drag that is only 4 times as much as the smaller human. Now let's take this to the extreme. An ant and an elephant jump out of a plane. The elephant is going to need a massive sized parachute, but the ant probably doesn't need anything. Since the weight to area ratio is super tiny for a super tiny object, the ant will have a very small terminal velocity. It can probably impact the ground with little injury. Note: to my ant-readers. Please be safe and don't try this in real life in the unlikely event that I am wrong. But size matters—especially when falling with air resistance. I think this might be my longest blog post. Congratulations if you made it all the way to the end. More Great WIRED Stories","Stuff is constantly falling—off tables, out of bags, from the sky.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters often used the faces of the ""wolf pack"" in their banners Members of the infamous ""wolf pack"" group convicted of sexual abuse in Spain have been forced to flee a swimming pool in Seville. The men were present in a group with others when they were angrily confronted by swimmers. The case involved five men sexually abusing an 18-year-old woman at the San Fermin festival in Pamplona in 2016. It became a national scandal in Spain - and the men were released a few months into their nine-year sentence. All five men are originally from Seville, where at least two were recognised by other bathers at the public pool in Palomares del Río on Saturday. Spanish newspaper El País said they had been attending a birthday celebration. Angry members of the public shouted at the men, forcing them to move to another area and stay there until the facilities closed, Spanish media reported. Local mayor Juana Caballero issued a statement on Monday, saying: ""We will not allow Palomares del Río to become a refuge for rapists or criminals"". She said the local government would not permit anyone declared ""persona non grata"" to use public spaces and cause concern. The men are nicknamed after their Whatsapp group - titled La manada (the wolf pack) - in which they bragged about their actions and of the video recordings taken during the attack. They were acquitted of rape, which under Spanish law requires violence or intimidation to be used. Police said the victim was ""passive or neutral"", keeping her eyes closed during the attack. All five men were sentenced for sexual abuse rather than the more serious crime of rape. The shocking nature of the incident and the perceived light punishment led to an outcry and widespread protests.","Angry swimmers force members of the notorious ""wolf pack"" to leave a public pool in Seville.",2018-08-21T10:13:53Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Spain's 'wolf pack' sex attackers confronted at Seville pool,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45257551,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FF64/production/_103108356_gettyimages-951577626.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,force,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The Palestinian health ministry said thousands of protesters were hit by live rounds Palestinian health officials say more than 100 Palestinians have been killed and 10,000 injured by Israeli troops over the past six weeks at a series of protests along the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Sixty died on Monday alone, when 40,000 took part in demonstrations that coincided with the controversial relocation to Jerusalem of the US embassy. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel's military of carrying out ""massacres"" of unarmed civilians, but Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted its troops acted in self-defence and blamed the militant group Hamas, which dominates Gaza, for the deaths. Fierce exchanges over Gaza killings What has happened at the protests? Image copyright Reuters Image caption The protesters demanded that Palestinian refugees be given the right of return Hamas and other groups organised the protest campaign, dubbed the ""Great March of Return"", in support of the right of Palestinian refugees to return to land they fled from or were forced to leave in the war which followed Israel's founding in 1948. The Israeli government, which has long ruled out any right of return, said terrorists wanted to use the protests as cover to cross into its territory and carry out attacks. Before the protests began, Israeli officials said soldiers would be permitted under certain rules to fire live ammunition at anyone attempting to damage the border fence, and even against people coming within 300m (985ft) of it - a figure that was reportedly later reduced to 100m. Image copyright EPA Image caption The Israeli military said ""rioters"" had thrown stones and firebombs at its troops Despite the warnings, thousands of Palestinians approached the fence during the protests. A number threw stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli soldiers deployed on the Israeli side of the border, and flew kites laden with petrol soaked material intended to start fires on Israeli territory. Israeli troops responded by firing tear gas, rubber bullets and various types of live ammunition. Gaza border violence in pictures What do human rights groups say? They have accused the Israeli military of using excessive force. They have said Israeli soldiers deployed near the Gaza protests were required to operate according to the international legal framework applicable to police and other law enforcement officials, which is part of international human rights law. It holds that the ""intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life"". Image copyright Reuters Image caption The United Nations has called for independent investigation into the violence ""An attempt to approach or crossing or damaging the fence do not amount to a threat to life or serious injury and are not sufficient grounds for the use of live ammunition,"" Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters on Tuesday. ""This is also the case with regards to stones and Molotov cocktails being thrown from a distance at well-protected security forces located behind defensive positions."" Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East director, said: ""This is a violation of international standards, with Israeli forces in some instances committing what appear to be wilful killings constituting war crimes."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption At least 13 children have been killed and hundreds injured since the protests began Last month, the group documented witness testimony, video and photographic evidence that it said showed Israeli troops were killing and maiming demonstrators who posed no imminent threat to them. The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said the open-fire orders were ""manifestly unlawful"" and called on Israeli soldiers in the field to refuse to comply with them. Last month, six other human rights groups asked the Israeli Supreme Court to revoke the military's rules of engagement that they said permitted live fire at protesters classified as ""key agitators"" even when they did not pose an immediate threat to life. The groups said soldiers should instead follow the law enforcement framework. The court's decision is pending. What does Israel say? Image copyright Reuters Image caption Israeli soldiers were deployed on berms on the Israeli side of the frontier Lawyers for the Israeli government argued before the Supreme Court that the military's rules of engagement along the Gaza border were ""in keeping with Israeli and international law"". They asserted that the demonstrations along the border were ""part of the armed conflict between the Hamas terrorist organisation and Israel"". The military's open-fire orders, they said, were therefore subject to international humanitarian law - also known as the law of armed conflict - rather than international human rights law. Mr Netanyahu said on a Monday that Hamas, which has fought three wars with Israel since 2008, had declared that ""it intends to destroy Israel and sends thousands to breach the border fence in order to achieve this goal"". ""We will continue to act with determination to protect our sovereignty and citizens."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Israeli military used drones to spray tear gas at protesters gathered near the fence The Israeli military has insisted that its troops have acted ""according to standard operating procedures"" when confronting Palestinians ""partaking in violent riots"". ""We resort to live fire only when absolutely necessary and when there is clear threat to infrastructure or to Israeli soldiers. If there is, then we use snipers who fire specifically and under very clear guidance by commanders,"" spokesman Col Jonathan Conricus said last month. The military has said it also foiled a number of ""terrorist attacks"" orchestrated by Hamas during the protests and killed people trying to plant bombs at the fence or break through it. Image copyright AFP Image caption Hamas leaders visited the protest sites and encouraged people to try to breach the fence On Tuesday, the military said it had evidence that at least 24 of the 60 people reported killed the previous day were ""terrorists with documented terror background"", including many ""active Hamas operatives"". Hamas acknowledged that five of those killed on the first day of protests in March belonged to its military wing, saying they were protesting ""side-by-side with their people"". But it has refrained from acknowledging the deaths of any other members at subsequent protests. Why is the legal framework so important? Noam Lubell, a professor of international law at the University of Essex, said human rights law required a graduated approach to the use of force - starting with no force, on to minimal force, and reaching lethal force only in the context of imminent threats to life. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Security forces are not permitted to open fire on civilians if they are only demonstrating The law of armed conflict, he added, contained a different set of rules, some of which could allow in certain circumstances for direct recourse to lethal force against particular individuals, including combatants in wars and civilians directly participating in hostilities. However, it does not entitle security forces to open fire on civilians if they are only demonstrating. Professor Lubell said that if the Israeli military was operating under the armed conflict model along the Gaza border, then it might argue it was only targeting individuals taking a direct part in hostilities. But he added: ""There would still need to be legal scrutiny to see how they have interpreted taking a direct part in hostilities - was it construed to include only individuals attempting to use weapons or explosives, or was it anyone coming near the fence? The latter would seem too broad of an interpretation to allow for direct lethal force."" Image copyright AFP Image caption Israeli troops detained three Palestinians who tried to approach the border fence on Tuesday And even if the law of armed conflict was applicable in this situation, while it might allow for lethal force against members of armed groups operating from within the crowd, as far as civilians taking part in a demonstration - including a ""riot""- are concerned, the expectation is still that any force used towards them would be based on the law enforcement framework in international human rights law. Additionally, if the armed groups are using the civilian crowds for cover, that could in itself be a violation of international law on their part. However, even if that is the case, it does not remove the civilian protection from demonstrators entitled to it. Professor Lubell said there was also the question of whether, given that the protests did not come as a surprise, more could have been done by the Israeli military in advance to minimise the use of deadly force - something both international human rights law and the law of armed conflict require. These recent events also cannot be divorced from the larger picture of the situation in Gaza, which itself raises many legal questions with regard to who has the power and obligations to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in the territory.",Israeli troops have been criticised for using live fire in response to Palestinian protests in Gaza.,2018-05-16T09:29:27Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44124556,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5F30/production/_101586342_mediaitem101586338.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,force,1
CHARLES GRASSLEY,"In a July 21, 2017 memo, the secretary of defense, James Mattis, made promising comments about his ambitions to end wasteful spending at the Pentagon. He wrote that he expected leaders at all levels in the department to exercise the utmost degree of stewardship over every penny spent and that only by instilling budget discipline, by establishing a culture of cost awareness, and by holding ourselves accountable, can we earn the trust and confidence of the Congress and the American people that we are the best possible stewards of taxpayer dollars.
Ive spent more than three decades reviewing egregious spending at the Defense Department. The sentiments expressed in the memo were encouraging, so much so that I sent Secretary Mattis a letter of support. Since then, however, it seems the department has done very little to change its ways.

These are just the latest examples on a long list of unacceptable purchases made by the department, including $436 for hammers in the 1980s, and $117 soap dish covers and $999 pliers in the 1990s.
These wasteful expenditures reflect major underlying financial problems at the department, whose 2019 budget is more than $700 billion. If it had its financial house in order, overpriced parts and contracts might have been detected before ever being approved.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz (left) said: ""Russian spying in Europe is unacceptable"" An Austrian colonel is being investigated on suspicion of spying for Russia, Austrian officials have said. The 70-year-old suspect, recently retired, is said to have been spying since the 1990s up until this year. Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl has cancelled her planned December visit to Russia over the scandal. Until now, Austria has been seen as one of only a few allies of Russia in the EU. Russian President Vladimir Putin was at Ms Kneissl's wedding in August. The EU has imposed a series of sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and support for separatists in the east, as well as the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in March. Image copyright AFP Image caption President Putin was a guest of honour at Ms Kneissl's wedding, ignoring the controversy about the invitation But unlike most of the EU nations, Austria decided not to expel Russian diplomats over the Skripals. Vienna's relations with Moscow have been under particular scrutiny since Austria's far-right Freedom Party (FPO) became a coalition partner of the current government last year. The FPO has a ""co-operation pact"" with Russia's governing United Russia party. And analysts also point out that Austrian officials have been calling for closer co-operation between the EU and Russia in key energy sectors, despite the frosty ties between the two sides. What is known about the suspected spy? The news about an ongoing investigation into the case was revealed by Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz at a press briefing in Vienna on Friday. He said that - if confirmed - such activities ""can't improve the relationship between the EU and Russia"". Meanwhile, Austrian Defence Minister Mario Kunasek said that the spying case came to light a ""few weeks ago"" with help from another European intelligence agency. ""We can't say for the moment whether this is an isolated incident or not,"" Mr Kunasek said. The suspect's identity has not been publicly released. However, Austrian media reported that the colonel had been extremely professional and had worked in the Austrian army's control centre in the state of Salzburg. He is believed to have kept in touch with his Russian contact known as ""Yuri"", using sophisticated equipment, according to the Kronen Zeitung newspaper. It says the Russians had been particularly keen on secret information about Austria's air force, artillery systems and profiles of high-ranking officers. The colonel had been paid 300,000 (£261,000; $341,000) for his services, media reports say. How did Russia react? It summoned Austria's ambassador in Moscow, mirroring an earlier move by Vienna. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he had been ""unpleasantly surprised"" by the latest news from Austria. ""Recently our Western partners have made it a rule not to use traditional diplomacy, but instead use so-called 'megaphone diplomacy' by publicly accusing us and for explanations about matters we know nothing about,"" Mr Lavrov said.",The now retired colonel is suspected of handing over secrets about Austria's air force and artillery.,2018-11-09T17:58:14Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Austrian colonel 'spied for Russia since 1990s',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46155837,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/72C8/production/_104248392_1c20f0b8-7901-42f8-947d-44e5c7edec27.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,force,1

Turkey's president vowed to ""suffocate"" efforts to train the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and create what he called a ""terror army"". Turkey considers Kurdish fighters, prominent in the SDF, to be terrorists. Syria's government decried the ""blatant assault"" on its sovereignty, and Russia warned it could lead to partition. With US help, the SDF has captured tens of thousands of square kilometres of territory from Islamic State (IS) militants. In October, the alliance took full control of the northern city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the ""caliphate"" declared by the jihadist group in 2014. Since then, SDF fighters have been advancing southwards along the eastern side of the Euphrates river valley, clearing the last remaining militants from the desert area. On Saturday, a spokesman for the US-led multinational coalition against IS confirmed that it was working with the SDF to establish and train a new Syrian Border Security Force (BSF). ""Currently, there are approximately 230 individuals training in the BSF's inaugural class, with the goal of a final force size of approximately 30,000,"" Col Thomas Veale told The Defense Post. About half of the force would be made up of Kurdish and Arab SDF fighters who were no longer involved in the battle against IS, he added. The recruitment of the other half is under way. The BSF will deploy along sections of Syria's northern border with Turkey under SDF control, as well as the eastern bank of the Euphrates, which effectively serves as the dividing line between the SDF and Syrian pro-government forces. Image copyright AFP Image caption In October, SDF fighters took full control of the northern city of Raqqa On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the US had acknowledged it was ""in the process of creating a terror army on our border"" and promised to put an end to it. ""It is for us to suffocate this terror army before it is born,"" he said. Mr Erdogan added that preparations were complete for a Turkish military operation against the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in north-western Syria, and that it could be launched at any moment. Turkey has consistently opposed the coalition's support for the SDF because the force is dominated by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia. Ankara considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades. Washington disagrees and insists the YPG has been vital to the battle against IS.

CHARLES M. BLOW,"He uses imprecision as a way of making statements in which he parrots unknown and possibly nonexistent sourcing — ironically, the very thing that this projectionist accuses the “fake news” of doing. He does this by couching wild accusations and conspiracy theories with the phrase “people are saying.” Which people? Names, please. And, how many do these “people” number? Again, this is uncheckable phrasing. With nearly 330 million people in America and seven billion on the planet, it would be hard to find a thing that some people are not saying, so in a way, you could say pretty much anything and safely bet that some other people are saying the same thing in some form. Trump sometimes strings these phrases together in whole passages that suggest a certitude that is clearly absent. In a March 2017 interview with Time magazine, Trump discussed his patently false claim that he had been wiretapped by Obama, saying: “And a lot of information has just been learned, and a lot of information may be learned over the next coming period of time. We will see what happens.” This habit stretches all the way back to the campaign. At a 2015 campaign event, when a man said, “We have a problem in this country: It’s called ‘Muslim,’” and continued by saying, “You know our current president is one,” and then asked when “we” could “get rid of” the “training camps growing, where they want to kill us,” Trump didn’t object or correct that man, but instead responded: “We’re going to be looking at a lot of different things. And, you know, a lot of people are saying that, and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there. We’re going to be looking at that and many other things.” This is a Rorschach test of rhetoric, where meaning splits from emotion. The answer itself is a string of meaningless, immeasurable, unenumerated pledges and accusations held together by spit and hostility. It is instead the emotion that registers. He abhors Muslims as much as the questioner and wants to reassure the questioner of such. Trump not only uses language to tell blatant lies, he also uses it to pack softer lies, exaggerations and enigmatic inaccuracies around the edges.",President Trump speaking to the media before boarding Air Force One.,2018-05-24T09:30:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Op-Ed Columnist: The Elevation of Imprecision,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/opinion/trump-lying-imprecision.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/23/opinion/23blowWeb/23blowWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1
EILEEN SULLIVAN,"An earlier report from NBC News suggested that Mr. Kelly had called the president “an idiot” in private and viewed himself as the only bulwark against chaotic decision-making and dangerous decisions by Mr. Trump. On Friday, Mr. Kelly accompanied the president on the Marine One helicopter ride from the White House to Joint Base Andrews, where Air Force One was waiting to take Mr. Trump to Dallas. In a public appearance seemingly designed to underscore their relationship, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Trump walked together from the helicopter to a group of reporters waiting nearby. “The New York Times has falsely reported, said things that are absolutely false. So I just want to tell you that,” Mr. Trump said, turning to Mr. Kelly to make comments. The president also addressed the ongoing special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, and said he would be happy to sit down and answer Mr. Mueller’s questions. But he said that the investigation is a witch hunt being run by Democrats, and his lawyers will not let him. “I would love to speak. I would love to. Nobody wants to speak more than me,” Mr. Trump said. But the investigation “is a very unfair thing. If I thought it was fair, I would override my lawyers.” Mr. Trump said all of the investigators are Democrats and incorrectly said Mr. Mueller worked for former President Barack Obama for eight years. Mr. Mueller, a longtime Republican, was appointed by former President George W. Bush. He served his 10-year-term as the F.B.I. director, and Mr. Obama asked him to stay on for another two years. Mr. Obama then named James D. Comey to the post, and he served during the rest of the Obama administration. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey a year ago, a move that ultimately led to Mr. Mueller’s appointment. Mr. Trump also discussed the current negotiations with North Korea and said his administration was in constant contact about the fate of three Americans held there. On Thursday, Mr. Giuliani said the Americans would be released that day. “A lot of things have already happened with respect to the hostages,” Mr. Trump said. “And I think you’re going to see very good things.”","President Trump spoke to reporters before boarding Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Md.",2018-05-04T14:52:00Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump Undercuts Giuliani About Payments to Stormy Daniels,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/trump-giuliani-stormy-daniels.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/05/us/politics/05dc-trump/05dc-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1

Thousands of mourners have been attending funerals across India for some of the security force personnel killed by a suicide bomber in Indian-administered Kashmir on Thursday.
At least 40 paramilitary police died in the attack near Srinagar.
The militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad said it carried out the attack.
India has imposed a swathe of economic measures on Pakistan after the attack, including revoking Most Favoured Nation trading status and raising customs duty to 200%.
Although Jaish-e-Mohammad is based in Pakistan, Islamabad has denied any role in the attack.
Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir but control only parts of it.

Danny Crichton,"Elon Musk has been one of the few Silicon Valley luminaries to place intense attention on the potential dangers of AI, raising a billion dollars with Y Combinator’s Sam Altman to found OpenAI. Musk has continued the drumbeat on AI’s dangers, telling a crowd at SXSW this week that “ A.I. is far more dangerous than nukes ” and asking “So why do we have no regulatory oversight? This is insane.” Well, the wheels of Washington are turning, and DCers are starting to investigate the opportunities and challenges that AI poses to the nation. Today, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), one of America’s top defense and foreign policy think tanks, announced the creation of a Task Force on Artificial Intelligence and National Security, as part of the organization’s Artificial Intelligence and Global Security Initiative. The task force will be co-led by Andrew Moore, the current dean of Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science, and Robert O. Work, who was deputy defense secretary from 2014-2017 and formerly CEO of CNAS. Moore is a major AI scholar with tens of thousands of scholarly citations, particularly in statistical machine learning and reinforcement learning. TechCrunch interviewed Moore a little more than a year ago about the challenge of retaining AI staff against talent poachers like Uber. In addition to Moore and Work, a who’s-who of the national security and DC policy community are members of the task force. Two notable ones from Silicon Valley are Terah Lyons, who is the executive director of the Partnership on AI, a non-profit industry trade group of tech companies interested in improving AI for social impact, and Shivon Zilis, who is simultaneously a partner at Bloomberg Beta, and a project director at OpenAI, Tesla, and Neuralink (i.e. she might know Musk). The launch of the task force is a sign that Washington is starting to wake up to the challenges that artificial intelligence poses, not just to the military, but also to the very foundations of how democracy is supposed to function. AI applications are obvious in defense, from identifying objects and people to responding to cyberattacks in a more automated fashion. But the security implications of AI are not limited to just hard defense topics. Whether it is computational propaganda, or fake videos, or private data leaks, artificial intelligence is increasingly at the center of the security and prosperity challenges facing the country. CNAS’ new look at this emerging area is hopefully just the first step of Washington starting to understand what Silicon Valley has built — and what it needs to build going forward.","Elon Musk has been one of the few Silicon Valley luminaries to place intense attention on the potential dangers of AI, raising a billion dollars with Y Combinator’s Sam Altman to found OpenAI.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says its operation is against the Quds Force - a elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.
It provided no details. But on Sunday the IDF said it had intercepted a rocket fired at the Golan Heights from Syria.
Syria's Sana state news agency says the country's air defences had repelled ""an Israeli aerial attack"" in the south.
On Monday, the IDF tweeted that it had ""started striking Iranian Quds targets Syrian in territory"".
The reported operation comes after Israel said on Sunday that a rocket fired at the northern Golan Heights had been intercepted by the Iron Dome defence system.
Israel rarely admits carrying out attacks on targets inside Syria.
But in May 2018, Israel said it had struck almost all of Iran's military infrastructure there in its such biggest assault since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011.

Darrell Etherington,"The U.S. Air Force wants to maintain its options: It awarded a total of $640 million in satellite launch contracts to both SpaceX and the United Launch Alliance (Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s joint space launch venture), with the goal of making sure it has access to at least two options for launching its payloads to space. SpaceX won a $290 million contract to launch three GPS satellites for the USAF by the end of 2020, the Wall Street Journal reports, and the ULA will receive $351 to launch two space craft from the air defence agency. On a per launch basis, SpaceX’s rockets cost around $70 million less, and that’s also part of why the Air Force went with two providers for this next spate of launches, too. The report notes that this is part of an ongoing cost reduction effort, which should bode well for SpaceX. The launch startup has also just demonstrated its Falcon Heavy rocket, which could put larger payloads into space and eventually compete more directly with the Atlas V from ULA for different kinds of Air Force contracts. Meanwhile, ULA is moving forward with its efforts to develop a lower-cost rocket and launch option, but that’s likely still a few years away from being viable. The Pentagon has long had a goal of establishing at least two viable launch providers for missions relating to national security, so that’s a big reason for continuing to play nice on both sides of this private space race. SpaceX has an Air Force launch on the manifest, which is possible pre-validation of the rocket only because it’s an experimental mission, coming up later this year.","The U.S. Air Force wants to maintain its options: It awarded a total of $640 million in satellite launch contracts to both SpaceX and the United Launch Alliance (Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s joint space launch venture), with the goal of making sure it has acc…",2018-03-15T11:40:25Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",SpaceX and United Launch Alliance land $640 million in Air Force launches,http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/spacex-and-united-launch-alliance-land-640-million-in-air-force-launches/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/spacex-falcon-heavy-181.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,force,1
Devin Coldewey,"Hot on the heels of a surprising 52-47 Senate disapproval of the FCC’s new, weaker net neutrality rules, the House of Representatives will soon attempt to force a similar vote under the Congressional Review Act. Representative Mike Doyle (D-PA) announced in a statement and at a press conference following the Senate vote that he will begin the process first thing tomorrow morning. “I have introduced a companion CRA in the house,” Rep. Doyle said, “but I’m also going to begin a discharge petition which we will have open for signature tomorrow morning. And I urge every member who’s uproots a free and open internet to join me and sign this petition so we can bring this legislation to the floor.” The CRA requires Senate and House to submit the resolution itself, in the former’s case Joint Resolution 52, after which a certain number of people to sign off on what’s called a discharge petition, actually forces a vote. In the Senate this number is only 30, which makes it a useful tool for the minority party, which can easily gather that many votes if it’s an important issue (a full majority is still required to pass the resolution). But in the House a majority is required, 218 at present. That’s a more difficult ask, since Democrats only hold 193 seats there. They’d need two dozen Republicans to switch sides, and while it’s clear from the defection of three Senators from the party line that such bipartisan support is possible, it’s far from a done deal. Today’s success may help move the needle, though. Should the required votes be gathered, which could happen tomorrow, or take much longer, the vote will then be scheduled, though a Congressional aide I talked to was unsure how quickly it would follow. It only took a week in the Senate to go from petition to floor vote, but that period could be longer in the House depending on how the schedule works out.","Hot on the heels of a surprising 52-47 Senate disapproval of the FCC's new, weaker net neutrality rules, the House of Representatives will soon attempt to force a similar vote.

Dipayan Ghosh & Ben Scott,"Dipayan Ghosh is the Pozen Fellow at the Shorenstein Center at the Harvard Kennedy School. He was a technology and economic adviser to the Obama White House, and until recently, worked on privacy policy issues at Facebook. Ben Scott is a director of policy and advocacy at Omidyar Network and served as policy adviser for innovation at the State Department during the Obama administration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own; view more opinion at CNN. (CNN) Two steps forward. Two steps back. That seems to be the tale that history will tell about the role of the internet as a force for democracy in the early 21st century. In less than a decade, we have witnessed what amounts to a technology revolution in politics, and then a counterrevolution. The speed of this rise and fall is astonishing. It was only a decade ago that Barack Obama demonstrated the power of the internet as a tool of electoral organizing. Soon after, digital media and big data became common to virtually every campaign. Similarly, in the early part of this decade, the smartphone and social media emerged as catalysts for political movement formation. The inspiration of the Arab Spring even romanticized a narrative about Facebook revolutions. But now the bloom is off the rose. Today, we are experiencing a darker side of these once-liberating technologies. The same tools that have the power to decentralize knowledge, media and institutions of governance have also proven vehicles for cyberattack, mass surveillance, information control and the manipulation of public opinion. The elections of 2016 and 2017 -- particularly in the United Kingdom, United States and France -- ushered in a new era of digital threats to democracy and called into question the power that technology companies hold over society. Our democracies are awash in digital disinformation that feeds a new kind of populist backlash -- a movement that has embraced an alternative media system of conspiracy, resentment and polarization. No democracy appears immune to this malady. We now stand at a crossroads. The potential of technology to be democratic and liberating remains. But it is now clear that the dynamics of the market will not inexorably lead us to the promised land. We will have to work to achieve that which we hoped would happen naturally. We must design a new digital social contract to steer technological development back toward serving the well-being of democratic society. It won't be easy. There is no single solution that can meaningfully change outcomes. Only a combination of policies -- all of which are necessary and none of which are sufficient by themselves -- will begin to show results over time. Quietly, this work has already begun. For over a year now, Sen. Mark Warner, along with Sens. Amy Klobuchar and the late John McCain, have been pushing for the Honest Ads Act, a measure that would require internet companies to be transparent about the provenance of political digital advertisements. Other members of Congress are investigating the shadowy market of data brokers and calling for more robust data privacy measures to protect consumers. The Federal Trade Commission, too, has begun an in-depth public inquiry into how it should modernize its regulations to account for the anticompetitive behavior of digital platform companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter. California recently enacted a new data privacy law, and other states are exploring similar moves. But these efforts are not nearly ambitious enough to rebalance the scales between the public interest and the interests of the most valuable industry on the planet. They are overly narrow and retrospective, and fail to account for the technological advances that are just around the corner. They are reasonable responses to symptoms. But we must address the root, viral source of these many problems that are festering at the feet of the American democracy. If we are truly to fix the internet, we must examine the commercial regime that powers it; we must investigate the connections and contradictions between business models and public interests and values. Our analysis indicates that it is the business model of tech platform companies that encourages and exacerbates the spread of political disinformation on the leading internet platforms. The algorithms that select and deliver our daily diet of digital media personalize what we see based on vast amounts of data they have collected about us over the years (e.g. web browsing history, e-commerce, and social networks. But the goal is not to inform the public, it is to entertain, to capture attention, and to sell ads. In this business, falsehood, conspiracy, and outrage simply sell better than truth, reason and sober debate. It is unfair to expect publicly traded companies to change, unless there are clear rules they must all follow. But change they must. The immortal words of James Madison ring true for the digital age: ""A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce, or a tragedy, or perhaps both."" We need a new rule for the market that breaks this vicious alignment between disinformation and profit maximization and places power back in the hands of the consumer: a new Digital Social Contract. But what should such new rules look like? In a new report published by the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center and New America, we highlight three areas of public interest concern that national policymakers must tackle in the way forward to protect the American electorate while enabling innovation over the internet. Transparency. As citizens, we have the right to know who is trying to influence our political views and how they are doing it. We must have explicit disclosure about the operation of the advertising and content curation processes on dominant digital media platforms -- including the social impact of algorithms and the presence of nonhuman accounts. For example, we should be able to see who bought the ads we see, how many people they reached, and why we were targeted specifically. Privacy. As individuals with the right to personal autonomy, we must be given more control over how our data is collected, used, and monetized -- especially when it comes to sensitive information that shapes political decision-making. We should be able to reject or limit the ability of big companies to collect and use personal information about us to steer advertising and political propaganda. Competition. As consumers, we must have meaningful options to find, send and receive information over digital media. To achieve this in a market dominated by huge multinational companies, we need to beef up antitrust protections, to crack down on anti-competitive practices, and to open space in the market for competitors. We have watched as the American technology industry has started up, conquered the world, and then -- in rapid succession -- inspired and fractured our democratic political system. We have also witnessed them fail to live up to the tremendous challenge of protecting critical public institutions. It is now clear they cannot do this job without running counter to their business models and shareholder interests. So, as self-governing societies, it is time for us to help industry help themselves by establishing a digital social contract. These principles and policies are the starting points to steer the development of technology markets back toward the idealism of earlier days. The potential of the internet to empower democracy in the world remains. But it will not happen by itself.","If we are truly to fix the internet, we must investigate the connections and contradictions between business models and public interests and values, write Dipayan Ghosh and Ben Scott",2018-09-26T14:24:00Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",How to make technology a force for good,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/opinions/new-digital-social-contract-ghosh-scott/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180521191129-mark-zuckerberg-testimony-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,force,1
Devin Coldewey,"The Democratic push to restore net neutrality took another step today with the official filing of a petition, under the Congressional Review Act, to force a vote on whether to repeal the FCC’s unpopular new rules. The effort may be doomed in the end, but it’s still extremely important. The CRA is a way of reversing rules recently instated by federal agencies that’s simple and effective, though until this administration rarely used (but they made up for lost time, all right). Its expedited process and low bar to entry — only 30 senators are needed to bring a vote, and the vote generally happens quite quickly — have made it an ideal tool for Congress to undo Obama-era regulations, but the shoe is on the other foot now. Democrats in the Senate are using the CRA as a potential method of removing the rules the FCC voted for in December and returning to 2015’s Open Internet Order and strong net neutrality rules. Today they filed the actual petition to force the vote. “This is the fight for the internet,” said Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) in a press conference introducing the action. “By passing this resolution, we can send a clear message that this Congress won’t fall to the special interest agenda of President Trump and his broadband baron allies, but rather will do right by the people that send us here.” You can watch the whole proceeding below: Today, the petition that allows U.S. Senate Democrats to force a vote on my resolution to save #NetNeutrality is being officially filed.We are approaching the most important vote for the internet in the history of the Senate, and we are just #OneMoreVote away from securing victory. Join me and my colleagues in this historic moment and help us kick off a week of action to #SaveTheInternet: Posted by Senator Edward J. Markey on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 Right now there are 50 senators supporting the measure, including one Republican. The Democrats are hoping to make this issue extremely visible in order to put pressure on other, perhaps undecided, Republicans who might cross the aisle with enough prodding from their constituency. As I’ve written before, and as Senators themselves have admitted, the chance of this actually rolling back the rules is low, since it would have to also pass through the House, where Democrats are at a more serious disadvantage, then be signed by the President, which is unlikely to say the least. But by forcing a vote, they force everyone in the Senate to take a position for or against the rules, including those who have attempted to stay “neutral” through silence. By making them take a position with consequences, net neutrality can be made into a voting issue come election season this year, and in 2020. “It always helps to build pressure at the FCC level, but this is about us losing elections,” Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) told me late last year when this effort was just starting. “They have a 3:2 edge at the FCC because we lost. We have to understand that when we vote in 2020, we’re voting on the future of the internet. We can generate a lot of emails and that’s great. But the moment those emails are converted to votes, we win.” Expect the actual vote to take place some time in the next week or so, though be warned that even in the case of success there won’t be any immediate effect. As with everything in government, even the short game is a long game. But it’s imperative that in the meantime voters don’t forget that this is an ongoing and critical issue.","The Democratic push to restore net neutrality took another step today with the official filing of a petition, under the Congressional Review Act, to force a vote on whether to repeal the FCC's unpopular new rules.

Lucas Matney,"As we navigate further and further into this strange Ready Player One-like future that plenty of tech companies are investing heavily, Disney wants to ensure that people can feel content in the most life-like way possible. Disney Research has shown off some research into the world of haptic feedback via a vest with “pneumatically-actuated airbags.” The “Force Jacket” is powered by a jacket filled with 26 air packets attached via tubes to a machine that inflates and deflate them with precision at the appropriate time. Teamed with a virtual reality experience, the jacket can deliver experiences that make you feel like a virtual object is pushing up against you. In the case of Disney’s early tests, that could mean feeling like you’re getting hit by a snowball. While a lot of people have played around with body suits and vests sporting haptic feedback, there’s no replacement to actually feeling real pressure rather than a weird little jiggle. This definitely seems like a good direction for Disney to be looking in as it explores the role that virtual reality experiences could have in their amusement parks. The company has launched a Star Wars themed experience from The VOID at its Disney resorts and it’s clear that there’s an endless amount of potential from virtual reality combined with physical interactions.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","If France isnt willing to take action on climate change on its own, well, the courts are always an option to force the governments hand.
More than 1.8 million people worldwide have signed a petition from environmental groups to sue the French government for failing to take sufficient action on the matter. These groups, which include Greenpeace France and Oxfam France, are calling it the case of the century.
Theyre hoping to acquire 2 million signatures, but the fact that they havent met the goal yet hasnt stopped them from moving forward with litigation. They formally filed a case on December 17 demanding the government meet the Paris Agreement and the countrys own national energy transition strategy, and alleging that its decades of inaction has led to damages for which the plaintiffs are demanding compensation. French officials have two months to respond.
Hopefully, this move wont spark the same kind of backlash that previous attempts at climate policy in France have. Just earlier this year, President Emmanuel Macron announced a gas tax to help alleviate emissions from vehicles. In 2017, the country consumed 4.5 percent more fossil fuels than the scheduled target the French government had set out when it launched its energy transition act in 2015 to prevent further global warming.
However, that gas tax failed miserably when violent protests by so-called yellow vests erupted in November. The lower- and middle-class people who largely made up the protesters arent against climate action, per se. Theyre against climate action that doesnt consult them to ensure their needs are met. Addressing the needs of a nations most vulnerable is a key step in any just transition away from a fossil fuel economy. This is also how a government builds support for its policies, which is key to their success.
The gas tax is on pause, at least for now. But many believe the French government still needs to act, with 2018 ending as the countrys hottest year on record. Pollution from vehicles, industry, and agriculture results in 48,o00 deaths a year in France, according to a 2016 study. Frances former ecology minister quit on live radio in August because of his peoples failure to do anything about any of it.
So now people are turning to the courts. And theyve seen success in the past. In the United States, children in Massachusetts won a case to get their state government to develop a climate plan. Our Childrens Trust, the organization that supported them, is also behind a federal lawsuit thats still moving through the courts. In Colombia, similar litigation resulted in legal personhood for the countrys piece of the Amazon Rainforest in April. In 2015, the Netherlands was the first country where a judge ruled on the side of citizens and environmental organizations, mandating the government to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. That decision was upheld earlier this year.
Sometimes, legal action does work. At the very least, it pressures governments to acknowledge climate change exists. Well, most governments, that is.

Brian Heater,"The FCC’s wildly unpopular decision to kill net neutrality has sent legislators, companies and individuals scrambling for ways to keep the Obama era regulations in place. A new bid by Montana Governor Steve Bullock would cut through much of the red tape and force internet service providers to abide by earlier net neutrality rules. Bullock, a second term Democrat, told The New York Times that he plans to sign an executive order today that would bar any ISP with a state government contract from blocking or charging added fees for access to existing website. “If you want to do business with Montana,” the Governor said in the interview, “there are standards on net neutrality you will have to follow.” The new rule would impact any new or newly renewed contract inked after July 1 of this year. The list of providers that would likely be impacted includes some of the industry’s biggest names. AT&amp;T, Charter, CenturyLink, and Verizon all currently have contracts with the state. The executive order circumvents the lengthy processes currently facing other recently filed opposition, including a lawsuit filed last week by 22 state attorneys general. That same week, Mozilla filed a similar suit, and 49 Democratic Senators outlined their own plan for helping restore the rules. Like all of those planned actions, however, Bullock’s executive order is bound to face an uphill battle. Given the deep pockets of many ISPs, there are bound to be plenty of legal challenges. Of course, if the order does eventually make its way through, other states will likely attempt to duplicate its success.

Not everybody loves the design (including me, though some people have told me I’m wrong), but soon your opinion won’t matter because Google is about to upgrade your Calendar to the new design anyway. As the company announced today, G Suite users whose admins chose to be on the Rapid Release schedule will be auto-upgraded started January 8th and those on the Scheduled Release plan will be upgraded starting January 15th. You’ll still be able to opt out of the new UI until February 28th, but after that, “all users will be fully upgraded.” It’s worth noting that the new design is only one aspect of the refreshed Calendar. It also includes new features for making conference room bookings easier and allows you to apply rich formatting to Calendar invites.

DAVE PHILIPPS,"Mr. Minter also worries that the military may seize on unrelated medical issues as a pretext for rejecting transgender recruits. One applicant in Ohio spent five months submitting more and more medical records, and then was rejected in late May because of knee surgery he had as an infant. The applicant, who asked not to be named because he still hopes to join the military, said he was dumbfounded at the rejection, because he has had no issues stemming from the surgery for 25 years. The Defense Department declined to make any officials available for interview, citing pending litigation. It refused to say how long recruits have been kept waiting or how many have been rejected on medical grounds. But it said in a written statement that it “continues to comply with the court order,” and that “the time it takes to review each individual record will vary based upon the individual.” Thousands of transgender troops, who officially came out or transitioned in the military when the Obama administration decided in 2016 to lift a ban, are serving now. A RAND Corporation study in 2016 estimated their number at between 2,000 and 11,000. Many are in demanding jobs and have deployed overseas. Leaders of the Army, Marines, Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard told Congress this spring that they have seen no issues with the transgender troops. “As long as they can meet the standard of what their particular occupation was, I think we’ll move forward,” Gen. Robert Neller, the commandant of the Marine Corps, said in his testimony. But the Trump administration continues to oppose any transgender military service. Before it was blocked by the court injunctions, the administration sought not only to keep transgender troops from joining, but to discharge those already in the ranks. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a memo in February saying their presence threatened to “undermine readiness, disrupt unit cohesion, and impose an unreasonable burden on the military.” Last month, the Justice Department filed a motion to overturn one of the injunctions, arguing that the panel of Defense Department experts who created the Trump administration policy had the necessary authority to ban particular categories of recruits, and that the court had “provided scant explanation for disregarding that reasoned and reasonable military assessment.”","Nicholas Bade, a transgender man who is trying to enlist in the Air Force, outside the recruitment office in Chicago.

KATHERINE MANGU-WARD,"But this isnt an epic drama. Its a reality show. And like reality shows, it doesnt have a hero. The continual presence of cameras has a way of eroding public affection for whatever they are trained on, while paradoxically increasing appetite for the subject matter. (See: The Real Housewives of Every Single City in America.) The advent of C-SPAN coincided with a huge decline of public trust in the legislature. Gallup finds that 46 percent of people say they have very little confidence in Congress, double the 23 percent reported in 1979. Newspapers followed a similar trajectory over the same period (38 percent today compared with 12 percent). Gallup started asking about television news only in the early 1990s, but the decline is evident there as well. Was there ever a time when Americans believed their elected officials to be benevolent and omnipotent and their journalists to be objective and omniscient beings? Those 1979 confidence figures arent exactly overwhelming. But the benevolent and objective myth benefits the powerful, not the people. Puncturing it is not a loss for civility; its a gain for reality. Lies need to be countered by truths, certainly, and thats something Americans have looked to the press to do in the past. But the same forces that buoyed Mr. Trumps campaign have distorted news coverage toward sensationalism and away from sobriety. The best-case scenario, of course, would be for both elected officials and the Fourth Estate elites to be as pure as driven snow, in both action and intention. But thats unlikely to happen, as all of those positions are occupied by human beings. There are genuinely serious questions at stake right now about civil rights, debt, redistribution and the future of state power. But neither the press nor the politically powerful stand to gain much by grappling with those problems on TV, and they are tacitly willing to remain locked in a vicious cycle as long as it means they dont have to deal with the really sticky stuff. Which leaves us in a second-best scenario: If powerful politicians and powerful journalists can all, on occasion, be venal, petty and vain, its far better that the American people should have every opportunity to see that for themselves. That way, they will know to take every bite they are spoon-fed with a grain of salt. Katherine Mangu-Ward is the editor in chief of Reason magazine.

KATIE ROGERS,"“At a time when we are trying to integrate the department’s joint warfighting functions, I do not wish to add a separate service that would likely present a narrower and even parochial approach to space operations,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis wrote in a letter last year to Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the House Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee. Mr. Turner has opposed a legislative effort by the House Armed Services Committee to create a space division of the military. After Mr. Trump’s announcement, the Pentagon released a statement from Dana W. White, the Defense Department’s chief spokeswoman. “We understand the president’s guidance,” she said. “Our policy board will begin working on this issue, which has implications for intelligence operations for the Air Force, Army, Marines and Navy. Working with Congress, this will be a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders.” Last year, Congress punted on a decision to establish a space corps through the National Defense Authorization Act, and asked for an independent study on the issue. That report is due in August. A more expansive report, which is required to include an extensive road map to a space force, is due by the end of the year. Either way, legislative hurdles would lie ahead. The creation of a sixth branch of the military to join the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard would require congressional authorization and approval. Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, who is on the Senate Commerce Committee overseeing the nation’s space program — and who once spent six days in space — said that the president’s order lacked the support of the generals who would be required to carry it out. “Thankfully the president can’t do it without Congress because now is NOT the time to rip the Air Force apart,” Mr. Nelson said on Twitter. “Too many important missions at stake.”","The idea has troubled lawmakers and even some members of the administration, who have cautioned that it could create unnecessary bureaucratic responsibilities for a military burdened by conflicts.",2018-06-18T21:46:25Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump Orders Establishment of ‘Space Force’ as Sixth Military Branch,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/us/politics/trump-space-force-sixth-military-branch.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/19/us/politics/19dc-space/19dc-space-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1
Natasha Lomas,"The UK government’s pressure on tech giants to do more about online extremism just got weaponized. The Home Secretary has today announced a machine learning tool, developed with public money by a local AI firm, which the government says can automatically detect propaganda produced by the Islamic State terror group with “an extremely high degree of accuracy”. The technology is billed as working across different types of video-streaming and download platforms in real-time, and is intended to be integrated into the upload process — as the government wants the majority of video propaganda to be blocked before it’s uploaded to the Internet. So yes this is a pre-filtering approach to content moderation — which is something the European Commission has also been pushing for. Though it’s a highly controversial approach with plenty of critics. Supporters of free speech frequently describe the concept as a ‘censorship machine’, for instance. Last fall the UK government said it wanted tech firms to radically shrink the time it takes them to eject extremist content from the Internet — from an average of 36 hours to just two. It’s now evident how it believes it can force tech firms to step on the gas: By commissioning its own machine learning tool to demonstrate what’s possible and try to shame tech firms into action. TechCrunch understands the government acted after becoming frustrated with the response from platforms such as YouTube. It paid private sector firm, ASI Data Science, £600,000 in public funds to develop the tool — which is billed as using “advanced machine learning” to analyze the audio and visuals of videos to “determine whether it could be Daesh propaganda”. Specifically, the Home Office is claiming the tool automatically detects 94% of Daesh propaganda with 99.995% accuracy — which, on that specific sub-set of extremist content and assuming those figures stand up to real-world usage at scale, would give it a false positive rate of 0.005%. For example, the government says if the tool analyzed one million “randomly selected videos” only 50 of them would require “additional human review”. However, on a mainstream platform like Facebook, which has around 2BN users who could easily be posting a billion pieces of content per day, the tool could falsely flag (and presumably unfairly block) 50,000 pieces of content daily. And that’s just for IS extremist content. What about other flavors of terrorist content, such as Far Right extremism, say? It’s not at all clear at this point whether — if the model was trained on a different, perhaps less formulaic type of extremist propaganda — the tool would have the same (or worse) accuracy rates. Criticism of the government’s approach has unsurprisingly been swift and shrill… It does not matter how accurate your test is, but that when you start applying it at scale it will block/censor/cause the police to imprison innocent people: pic.twitter.com/CV32JEoM3b — Alec Muffett (@AlecMuffett) February 13, 2018 The Home Office is not publicly detailing the methodology behind the model, which it says was trained on more than 1,000 Islamic State videos, but says it will be sharing it with smaller companies in order to help combat “the abuse of their platforms by terrorists and their supporters”. So while much of the government anti-online extremism rhetoric has been directed at Big Tech thus far, smaller platforms are clearly a rising concern. It notes, for example, that IS is now using more platforms to spread propaganda — citing its own research which shows the group using 145 platforms from July until the end of the year that it had not used before. In all, it says IS supporters used more than 400 unique online platforms to spread propaganda in 2017 — which it says highlights the importance of technology “that can be applied across different platforms”. Home Secretary Amber Rudd also told the BBC she is not ruling out forcing tech firms to use the tool. So there’s at least an implied threat to encourage action across the board — though at this point she’s pretty clearly hoping to get voluntary cooperation from Big Tech, including to help prevent extremist propaganda simply being displaced from their platforms onto smaller entities which don’t have the same level of resources to throw at the problem. The Home Office specifically name-checks Vimeo, Telegra.ph and pCloud as smaller platforms it’s concerned about. Discussing the tool, Rudd told the BBC: “It’s a very convincing example that you can have the information that you need to make sure that this material doesn’t go online in the first place. “We’re not going to rule out taking legislative action if we need to do it, but I remain convinced that the best way to take real action, to have the best outcomes, is to have an industry-led forum like the one we’ve got. This has to be in conjunction, though, of larger companies working with smaller companies.” “We have to stay ahead. We have to have the right investment. We have to have the right technology. But most of all we have to have industry on our side — with industry on our side, and none of them want their platforms to be the place where terrorists go, with industry on side, acknowledging that, listening to us, engaging with them, we can make sure that we stay ahead of the terrorists and keep people safe,” she added. Last summer, tech giants including Google, Facebook and Twitter formed the catchily entitled Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (Gifct) to collaborate on engineering solutions to combat online extremism, such as sharing content classification techniques and effective reporting methods for users. They also said they intended to share best practice on counterspeech initiatives — a preferred approach vs pre-filtering, from their point of view, not least because their businesses are fueled by user generated content. And more not less content is always generally going to be preferable so far as their bottom lines are concerned. Rudd is in Silicon Valley this week for another round of meeting with social media giants to discuss tackling terrorist content online — including getting their reactions to her home-backed tool, and to solicit help with supporting smaller platforms in also ejecting terrorist content. Responding to her announcements today, a Facebook spokesperson told us: “We share the goals of the Home Office to find and remove extremist content as quickly as possible, and invest heavily in staff and in technology to help us do this. Our approach is working — 99% of ISIS and Al Qaeda-related content we remove is found by our automated systems. But there is no easy technical fix to fight online extremism. “We need strong partnerships between policymakers, counter speech experts, civil society, NGOs and other companies. We welcome the progress made by the Home Office and ASI Data Science and look forward to working with them and the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism to continue tackling this global threat.” A Twitter spokesman declined to comment, but pointed to the company’s most recent Transparency Report — which showed a big reduction in received reports of terrorist content on its platform (something the company credits to the effectiveness of its in-house tech tools at identifying and blocking extremist accounts and tweets). At the time of writing Google had not responded to a request for comment.","The UK government’s pressure on tech giants to do more about online extremism just got weaponized.

Taylor Hatmaker,"You never quite know what you’ll find on the dark web. In June, a threat intelligence team team known as Insikt Group at security research firm Recorded Future discovered the sale of sensitive U.S. military information in the course of monitoring criminal activity on dark web marketplaces. Insikt explains that an English-speaking hacker purported to have documentation on the MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle. Remarkably, the hacker appears to have been selling the goods for “$150 or $200.” According to Insikt Group, the documents were not classified but also contained sensitive materials including “the M1 Abrams maintenance manual, a tank platoon training course, a crew survival course, and documentation on improvised explosive device (IED) mitigation tactics.” Insikt notes that the other set of documents appears to have been stolen from a U.S. Army official or from the Pentagon but the source was not confirmed. The hacker appeared to have joined the forum explicitly for the sale of these documents and acknowledged one other incident of military documents obtained from an unaware officer. In the course of its investigation, Insikt Group determined that the hacker obtained the documents by accessing a Netgear router with misconfigured FTP login credentials. When the team corresponded with the hacker to confirm the source of hacked drone documents, the attacker disclosed that he also had access to footage from a MQ-1 Predator drone. Here’s how he did it: “Utilizing Shodan’s popular search engine, the actors scanned large segments of the internet for high-profile misconfigured routers that use a standard port 21 to hijack all valuable documents from compromised machines. “Utilizing the above-mentioned method, the hacker first infiltrated the computer of a captain at 432d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Reaper AMU OIC, stationed at the Creech AFB in Nevada, and stole a cache of sensitive documents, including Reaper maintenance course books and the list of airmen assigned to Reaper AMU. While such course books are not classified materials on their own, in unfriendly hands, they could provide an adversary the ability to assess technical capabilities and weaknesses in one of the most technologically advanced aircrafts.” Insikt Group notes that it is “incredibly rare” for hackers to sell military secrets on open marketplaces. “The fact that a single hacker with moderate technical skills was able to identify several vulnerable military targets and exfiltrate highly sensitive information in a week’s time is a disturbing preview of what a more determined and organized group with superior technical and financial resources could achieve,” the group warns.","You never quite know what you’ll find on the dark web.

Natasha Lomas,"Consumers using drones in the UK have new safety restrictions they must obey from today, with a change to the law prohibiting drones from being flown above 400ft or within 1km of an airport boundary. Anyone caught flouting the new restrictions could be charged with recklessly or negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or a person in an aircraft — which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison or an unlimited fine, or both. The safety restrictions were announced by the government in May, and have been brought in via an amendment the 2016 Air Navigation Order. They’re a stop-gap because the government has also been working on a full drone bill — which was originally slated for Spring but has been delayed. However the height and airport flight restrictions for drones were pushed forward, given the clear safety risks — after a year-on-year increase in reports of drone incidents involving aircraft. The Civil Aviation Authority has today published research to coincide with the new laws, saying it’s found widespread support among the public for safety regulations for drones. Commenting in a statement, the regulator’s assistant director Jonathan Nicholson said: “Drones are here to stay, not only as a recreational pastime, but as a vital tool in many industries — from agriculture to blue-light services — so increasing public trust through safe drone flying is crucial.” “As recreational drone use becomes increasingly widespread across the UK it is heartening to see that awareness of the Dronecode has also continued to rise — a clear sign that most drone users take their responsibility seriously and are a credit to the community,” he added, referring to the (informal) set of rules developed by the body to promote safe use of consumer drones — ahead of the government legislating. Additional measures the government has confirmed it will legislate for — announced last summer — include a requirement for owners of drones weighing 250 grams or more to register with the CAA, and for drone pilots to take an online safety test. The CAA says these additional requirements will be enforced from November 30, 2019 — with more information on the registration scheme set to follow next year. For now, though, UK drone owners just need to make sure they’re not flying too high or too close to airports. Earlier this month it emerged the government is considering age restrictions on drone use too. Though it remains to be seen whether or not those proposals will make it into the future drone bill.","Consumers using drones in the UK have new safety restrictions they must obey from today, with a change to the law prohibiting drones from being flown above 400ft or within 1km of an airport boundary.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"This month, Italian physicists will turn on an experiment hunting for a fifth, dark force of nature, the Guardian reports. You may be familiar with the hunt for dark matter. Measurements of the universe imply that there should be five to six times more mass than experiments can observe directly. Many scientists hope to find this missing mass. A new experiment seeks evidence for whether dark mass interacts with regular matter through some dark particle messenger. “If we find this force it will completely change the paradigm we have now. It would open up a new world and help us to understand the particles and forces that compose the dark sector,” researcher Mauro Raggi from Sapienza University of Rome told the Guardian. Most ( but not all ) physicists believe that dark matter is a particle whose effects can only be observed through the force of gravity. No experiment has directly detected dark matter on Earth, but perhaps there is some portal to these dark sector particles that communicates with regular matter, too. It would be a dark boson, the word physicists use to describe force-delivering particles like photons. This is different from other dark matter-hunting experiments, which are looking for a totally new kind of particle, rather than a boson. The PADME experiment on the DAFNE Beam-Test Facility in Italy seeks to find these dark bosons. PADME receives DAFNE’s beam of the antimatter partners of electrons, called positrons. The beam of positrons strikes a piece of target material, a thin diamond film. The positrons combine with electrons inside the target material and annihilate in a flash of light and energy that the experiment can detect. If an unexplained amount of mass goes missing after the annihilation, it could be a signature of the dark boson. PADME is just one of several experiments looking for dark bosons. The LHC, scientists from Jefferson Lab in Virginia, and others are hunting for hints, though none have materialized. “Given that we have found little which convinces us for a definite extension of the Standard Model, searches in several directions are necessary. These experiments are a required step in this context,” Suchita Kulkarni, a theoretical physicist from the Institute of High Energy Physics in Austria who was not involved with the study. told Gizmodo via email. But what sets PADME apart is the masses of potential particles it might find. “This is a new chance for the lab to discover low-mass particles,” Caterina Doglioni told Gizmodo. She explained that this is a very challenging range to reach for experiments. Hunting for that lower mass is important, as it might allow physicists to validate the 2016 measurement from a Hungarian team that seemed to indicate the presence of a fifth fundamental force, in addition to gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force (which holds together atomic nuclei), and the weak force (responsible for radioactive decay). Some have doubts that the PADME experiment will find anything, as Physics World reported back in June. But even if it doesn’t, scientists might move it to a higher-energy particle accelerator at Cornell University in the early 2020s to continue its search. Solving the mystery of dark matter won’t be easy, but the determined hunt for new particles continues at increasingly sensitive experiments around the world.

It's all about friction A typical tug of war isn't really about strength—it's about friction. It doesn't matter how strong you are if you don't have enough friction to keep yourself from sliding. Let me show you. Here is a force diagram for two people in a tug of war. Each puller (person pulling on the rope) has essentially four forces acting on them. There is the downward weight which is balanced by the upward push of the ground. Since the person pulls on the rope, the rope pulls on the person in the opposite direction (this because of the two-ended nature of forces). Finally, there is the frictional force between the person and the ground. If no one is ""winning,"" all these forces add up to zero and the person stays at rest. In order to start moving in the winning direction, the frictional force must be greater than the force from the rope. This ""two-ended"" nature of forces means that forces come in pairs and are an interaction between two objects. It doesn't matter how hard the person on the left pulls on the rope, this same rope pulls on that person. So if you were to increase your pull to 1,000 Newtons—that same rope pulls on both people. So the key is the other force acting in the horizontal direction: friction. The maximum frictional force depends on two things. It depends on the types of surfaces interacting (maybe it's the rubber on a shoe interacting with a concrete floor) where some surfaces just have more friction than others. You really can't change this part in a tug of war. The friction force also depends on the normal force. The normal force is the force with which the two surfaces are pushed together. In the case of this simple tug of war above, the ground pushes up with a force equal to the gravitational weight of the person. This means that heavier people will have a greater frictional force acting to help win a tug of war. Oh, note that in the human vs. lion tug of war the humans are on a different surface than the lion. Who has the advantage? It's probably the lion since she could have uneven ground that would allow her to use more than just plain old sliding friction. So, it's really about mass If you have two contestants on equal ground with similar friction materials, mass matters. If the person on the left has half the mass of the person on the right, they will have half the friction. This means that it's pretty tough to beat a heavier puller. What about the lion? This looks like a young lion—she could have a mass of about 120 kg (up to maybe 182 kg). A typical massive human wrestler might have a mass of around 90 to 100 kg. Three humans will probably have more mass than a single female lion. Probably. The humans should have an advantage in the mass. It's also about rope friction Wait! This isn't a normal tug of war. The rope isn't straight. Did you notice that? This can make a big difference in that it can add another frictional force into play. Let me show you how this works with a diagram of the rope as seen from the top where it passes through the glass. That little yellow dot is just part of the rope. If the rope is at rest, then the forces on this part of the rope must add up to zero (which I have drawn to the side). And here is the key: The pull from the humans and the pull from the lion aren't in opposite directions. There is no way these two forces can add up to zero. The wall has to also push on the rope (to the up and to the right as seen in the diagram). This wall force is a normal force—yes, that same kind of normal force that can produce friction. Since there is a normal force on the rope, there can also be a frictional force. Of course this is a rope rubbing against smooth steel so that it might not normally be a huge frictional force. However, with a large normal force you can also get a significant frictional force. But which way does the frictional force act? If friction had emotions (which it doesn't—it's just a force), it would want to remain calm. Friction acts in a direction to prevent the two surfaces from sliding. If the humans pull harder than the lion, the lion will get the benefit of friction so that the rope doesn't slide towards the humans. However, if the lion pulled hard the frictional force would switch sides. So, who has the advantage with friction? The advantage goes to the loser (probably the lion). If you want a real fair match between humans and a lion then you have to a straight rope. It would also be best to put some tennis shoes on the lion and have her on cement.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption As well as a main force of 4,000, Kosovo's Security Force has 2,000 reserves If Kosovo is still committed to a Euro-Atlantic path, it has wandered dramatically off-piste in recent weeks. First it raised a 100% tariff on imports from neighbouring Serbia. Now its MPs are set to vote on raising an army. Both these measures run counter to warnings, threats and pleas from both the European Union and Nato. Friday's army vote would turn a lightly-armed 4,000-strong emergency response force into Kosovo's own professional military. This in a territory protected by 4,000 Nato Kfor troops since Serb forces pulled out in 1999. Serbia's Prime Minister Ana Brnabic is so enraged by the vote she has even talked of a military response. Its president has sought backing from Russia and China. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ana Brnabic has said she hopes the Serbian army will not have to be used ""but it is one of the options on the table"" Serbia views a Pristina-controlled military force as a threat to Kosovo's 120,000-strong ethnic-Serb minority. It does not recognise Kosovo, which declared independence 10 years ago. What has gone wrong? How different it all is from three months ago. All the talk in the Western Balkans was of Serbia and Kosovo swapping territory to bring their long-running dispute to an end, following six years of negotiations brokered by Brussels. This recent defiance is also a departure from Kosovo's long-established status as a pet project for Western powers. Kosovo hosts the European Union's largest civilian mission, as well as Kfor. It also benefits from massive amounts of international aid. So there was an element of biting the hand that has been feeding Kosovo for almost two decades, when Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj accused EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini of ""strangling"" the talks. ""She has transformed the dialogue on normalisation into a dialogue on territories. This has caused harm to our region,"" he said. Image copyright PRESIDENCY OF KOSOVO/HANDOUT Image caption Ms Mogherini's summer meeting with the Serb and Kosovo presidents might have looked awkward - but relations are a lot worse now His outburst was less about any putative territory swap, which Mr Haradinaj has fiercely opposed, and more a response to repeated European Union rebukes about Kosovo's unilateral imposition of swingeing taxes on Serbian and Bosnian imports. ""[This] definitely goes against the spirit and letter of co-operation in the region,"" said Ms Mogherini on Monday. ""I would expect the government of Kosovo to revoke this decision. But I am still confident that the two sides can fruitfully continue the dialogue."" Others are less optimistic. Will Kosovo have second thoughts? ""I am more worried about relations between Serbia and Kosovo than I have been for a long time,"" says James Ker-Lindsay, a Balkans specialist at the London School of Economics. ""The dialogue hasn't been good for a few years, but there was a certain equilibrium. That's been thrown out and it's very difficult to see where this is going."" Kosovo's determination to turn its lightly armed security force into an army has made things only worse. Image copyright EPA Image caption Kosovo has an ethnic Serb population of some 120,000, and Serbia sees a military force as a threat Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called its plans ill-timed and warned of ""serious repercussions for Kosovo's future Euro-Atlantic integration"". One bright spot for Pristina is that the US, perhaps predictably out of step with Brussels and Nato, has endorsed the formation of an army. Why form an army anyway? There is considerable frustration in Pristina that the EU has not followed through on a commitment to allow citizens of Kosovo visa-free travel to the bloc's borderless Schengen zone. Ten years on from its unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia, Kosovo is still lacking many of the signifiers of statehood. Upgrading the security force to an army would, at the very least, tick a box. But James Ker-Lindsay believes that ""lashing out"" will prove counterproductive for Kosovo. ""This is not the way to work with the EU. You don't start challenging them and being confrontational,"" he warns. He believes that their ""protected existence"", with 10 years of EU and US support, has left them disorientated. Now that a new phase with the EU has begun, new rules apply. Long term, it seems unthinkable that Kosovo would turn its back on Brussels. But, for the moment at least, it is certainly offering a cold shoulder.","Kosovo MPs are set to vote to turn its emergency force into an army, and Serbia does not like it.",2018-12-14T00:48:33Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Kosovo's army dreamers enrage their Serbian neighbours,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46551471,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16A4A/production/_104764729_051169460-1.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,force,1
EDWARD WONG,"Of the global powers that dominated the 19th century, China alone is a rejuvenated empire. The Communist Party commands a vast territory that the ethnic-Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty cobbled together through war and diplomacy. And the dominion could grow: China is using its military to test potential control of disputed borderlands from the South China Sea to the Himalayas, while firing up nationalism at home. Once again, states around the world pay homage to the court, as in 2015 during a huge military parade. For decades, the United States was a global beacon for those who embraced certain values — the rule of law, free speech, clean government and human rights. Even if policy often fell short of those stated ideals, American “soft power” remained as potent as its armed forces. In the post-Soviet era, political figures and scholars regarded that American way of amassing power through attraction as a central element of forging a modern empire. China’s rise is a blunt counterpoint. From 2009 onward, Chinese power in domestic and international realms has become synonymous with brute strength, bribery and browbeating — and the Communist Party’s empire is getting stronger. Photo A poster for a Chinese high-speed train at the construction site for a bridge spanning the Mekong River near Luang Prabang, Laos. Credit Adam Dean for The New York Times At home, the party has imprisoned rights lawyers, strangled the internet, compelled companies and universities to install party cells, and planned for a potentially Orwellian “social credit” system. Abroad, it is building military installations on disputed Pacific reefs and infiltrating cybernetworks. It pushes the “One Belt, One Road” infrastructure initiative across Eurasia, which will have benefits for other nations but will also allow China to pressure them to do business with Chinese state-owned enterprises, as it has done in recent years throughout Asia and Africa. So far, Chinese soft power plays a minor role. For one thing, the party insists on tight control of cultural production, so Chinese popular culture has little global appeal next to that of the United States or even South Korea. No nation knows China’s hard ways better than Norway. China punished it by breaking diplomatic and economic ties for six years after the independent Nobel committee in 2010 gave the Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, a pro-democracy writer imprisoned in China (he died of cancer in July ). President Xi Jinping is the avatar of the new imperium. The 19th Party Congress in October was his victory lap. Party officials enshrined “Xi Jinping Thought” in the party constitution, putting him on par with Mao Zedong. Mr. Xi said China had entered a “new era” of strength and the party would be the arbiter of public life. Mr. Xi holds appeal for foreign leaders aspiring to strongman status — President Trump openly admires him. Many Chinese people told me they still believed the country’s top leaders looked out for ordinary people, even if the party was rotting. This belief was rooted in abstract hope rather than empirical evidence. It was like peering through the toxic air enveloping Chinese cities in search of blue sky. The culture of hard power goes from top to bottom. In the provinces, party officials move quickly to suppress any challenges to their authority. When they sense rising mass resistance, they buy off or imprison the leaders. I saw this in my first year in China, when officials separately broke the will of parents furious over deadly tainted milk and ones grieving over thousands of children who had died in shoddily built schools during the Sichuan earthquake. I learned this was typical of the approach taken by Chinese officials. Most Chinese do not run afoul of the party, but those who do pay a high price. The abuse of power is frequent, and many Chinese say corruption is their top concern. All other issues, from environmental degradation to wealth inequality, are linked to it. Mr. Xi is canny enough to capitalize on the discontent: He leads an anticorruption drive that allows him to oust rivals and enforce party discipline. None of that results in the rule of law. And China’s domestic security budget has exceeded that of its military in recent years, even as both grow rapidly, highlighting the nation’s investment in hard power. Video I learned in 2016 that Tashi Wangchuk, a young entrepreneur who had spoken to me about his advocacy for broader Tibetan language education, had been detained in his hometown, Yushu, by police officers. In microblog posts, Mr. Tashi had asked local officials to promote true bilingual education, and he had appeared in 2015 in Times articles and video. Mr. Tashi is the kind of citizen China should value — someone working within the law to recommend policies that would benefit ordinary people and ease tensions. But two years later, Mr. Tashi remains imprisoned. A court tried him on Thursday for “inciting separatism” despite criticism from Western diplomats and human rights groups. The party’s style of rule threatens to turn sentiments against China even as the empire grows in stature. History teaches us about an inevitable dialectic: Power creates resistance. While the state can bend people to its will, those people meet it with fear and suspicion. The United States learns this lesson each time it over-relies on hard power. I traveled often to the frontier regions because it was there that the dynamic of power and resistance was most evident, and that I got the clearest look at how China treats its most vulnerable citizens, those outside mainstream ethnic Han culture. No other areas better embody the idea of imperial China. Conquered by the Manchus and reabsorbed by Mao, these lands make up at least one-quarter of Chinese territory. Party officials fear they are like the Central Asian regions under Soviet rule — always on the verge of rebellion and eager to break free.

Credit Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times In October 2016, I quietly entered the sprawling Tibetan Buddhist settlement of Larung Gar and watched the government-ordered demolition of homes of monks and nuns. In parts of Xinjiang populated by ethnic Uighurs, the tension is even greater, fueled by cycles of violence and repression. Uighurs speak in hushed tones of restrictions on Islam and mass detentions. Signs across Xinjiang forbid long beards and full veils, and surveillance cameras are everywhere. On my last reporting trip in China, to the Silk Road oasis of Kashgar, I saw police patrols in riot gear rounding up young men. An important bellwether is Hong Kong, the former British colony from which my parents emigrated to the United States. On this southern frontier, as in the west, the party works to silence the voices of students, politicians and other residents critical of its rule. Agents have even abducted booksellers. But those moves have actually led to more resistance and strengthened Hong Kong and Cantonese identity. They have also stoked greater fears of Beijing among citizens of Taiwan, the self-governing island that the party longs to rule. It is not a stretch to say the party’s ways of governance perpetuate a lack of trust by the Chinese in their institutions and fellow citizens. And its international policies light the kindling of resistance overseas, from Australia to Ghana. Chinese citizens and the world would benefit if China turns out to be an empire whose power is based as much on ideas, values and culture as on military and economic might. It had been that under its most glorious dynasties. But for now, the Communist Party embraces hard power and coercion, and this could well be what replaces the fading liberal hegemony of the United States on the global stage. It will not lead to a grand vision of world order. Instead, before us looms a void.

Rosa DeLauro,"Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat, is the US Representative from Connecticut's 3rd Congressional District. She serves on the Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the Department of Health and Human Services. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) My heart broke reading their stories. In May, at a border detention facility, a 14-year-old girl was told she could go to the shower. When she went, her mother was taken away. One day, after being detained crossing the border with his father in June, a 9-year-old boy was too tired to keep his eyes open. When he slept, his father was taken away. Their families fled to the United States to escape violence. Then our country tore them from their parents, keeping them confined before shipping them thousands of miles away to live in Connecticut—with strangers, in custody sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services. This is part of the story of the Trump administration's manufactured crisis at our border. It is an outrage and it is child abuse. As a result of its zero tolerance immigration policy, which has treated asylum seekers as criminals, the Trump administration separated nearly 3,000 children from their parents. July 26th was the court-mandated deadline for the administration to reunify children between the ages of 5 and 17 with their parents. But the Trump administration has failed to meet that deadline. According to the administration's own data, a s many as 463 parents have already been deported. Those parents and their children may never be reunited. The media may have moved on to new crises over Russia or Iran, but this does not mean that this crisis has been solved. As the Congress, we must ensure the Trump administration reunites every single family that it has separated, and without further delay. When I visited the border at the end of June, it was worse than I imagined. At the Ursula station, children were kept in freezing-cold holding cells with only tin foil blankets to keep them warm. The children and adults were moved to the Ursula Border Patrol Central Processing Center, a massive warehouse with cages that go on and on and with bright lights that beamed 24 hours a day. People were on display. There was no privacy. At the Immigration and Custom Enforcement's Port Isabel detention facility, I met with 10 mothers, many in tears, worried about their children. Child health experts have been sounding the alarm about the harm that we are doing to children by separating them from their families. According to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, ""Separations from parents or primary caregivers is one of the most potent traumatic stressors a child can experience, especially under frightening, sudden, chaotic or prolonged circumstances. Such separations may increase children's risk for developing depression, anxiety, separation-related post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (""traumatic separation"") or other trauma reactions."" The 9-year-old who was held in HHS-sponsored custody in Connecticut, according to legal briefings filed on his behalf, ""does not sleep well, distrusts adults and is depressed and tearful."" It is a moral imperative and a medical necessity that the administration reunite all the separated families now. Democrats in Congress are committed to ensuring this happens. On July 11th, the House Appropriations Committee marked up the Labor-HHS-Education FY19 funding bill. It accounts for nearly one third of the federal government's non-defense discretionary spending, including the Department of Health and Human Services. At that markup, my Democratic colleagues on the committee and I advanced some of the first and only Congressional actions to deal with the President's manufactured crisis. In a bill worth $177 billion, we passed several amendments that would require that the administration start providing firm answers and clear solutions to ameliorate the trauma this administration has inflicted. One amendment would provide an increase of $10 million for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Child Traumatic Stress Network. With those funds, grantees would be able to provide counseling to children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement who suffered the trauma of separation. Another amendment would direct the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to submit to Congress a plan outlining how the department would locate and return every child separated. If the Secretary fails to do so, according to the amendment, we would reduce his budget by $100,000 per day. It is especially important that we take these actions as news emerges that the Trump administration is still separating families, namely children from aunts, uncles, siblings and grandparents. My Congressional colleagues, who visited detention facilities at the border this weekend, confirmed as much. The President's executive order only recognizes parents as relatives. If grandparents cross with their grandchildren, they are still being separated. This crisis is far from over. As the Labor-H FY19 bill moves to the floor, I urge the majority to help us keep families together. Do not let the administration evade accountability. We have demanded answers: on the costs of the ""zero tolerance"" policy, the massive increase in detentions, on record-keeping and on reunification. But we have, to date, received no concrete answers from the Office of Management and Budget or the Department of Health and Human Services. Importantly, we must not be trading one abhorrent policy for another. During our markup, Subcommittee Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) offered an amendment that would have the result of holding children and their parents in jail-like conditions for an indefinite period of time, essentially overturning the 1997 Flores settlement, which limits the length of time and conditions under which US officials can detain immigrant children. Indefinite incarceration of innocent children is never the solution. Thankfully, t he tide has begun to turn on this crisis, following a bipartisan and national outcry. Last week, a federal judge ordered the two children being held in Connecticut to be returned to their parents. Finally back with her mom, according to her lawyer, the girl said, ""It is beautiful to be free.""","As the Congress, we must ensure the Trump administration reunites every single family that it has separated, and without further delay--and pays a penalty if it does not, writes Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro.",2018-07-26T20:20:48Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Opinion: Congress should force Trump to fix child separation outrage,https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/26/opinions/family-separation-refugees-delauro/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180725185810-family-reunified-bwi-07-23--2-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,force,1

CORAL DAVENPORT,"The Obama clean water regulation, which would have limited the use of pollutants like chemical fertilizers that could run off into small streams, came under fierce criticism from the rural landowners that make up a key component of Mr. Trump’s political base. “Today, E.P.A. is taking action to reduce confusion and provide certainty to America’s farmers and ranchers,” Mr. Pruitt said in a statement. “The 2015 WOTUS rule developed by the Obama administration will not be applicable for the next two years, while we work through the process of providing long-term regulatory certainty across all 50 states about what waters are subject to federal regulation.” We know. Global warming is daunting. So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. Mr. Pruitt told a conference of state agricultural commissioners that he intends to issue a draft proposal of replacement water regulations in the spring and to finalize new rules this year, according to Politico. The Waters of the United States rule, designed to limit pollution in about 60 percent of the nation’s bodies of water, was put forth by the E.P.A. and the Army Corps of Engineers in 2015. It had extended existing federal protections of large bodies of water, such as the Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound, to smaller bodies that flow into them, such as rivers, small waterways and wetlands. Issued under the authority of the 1972 Clean Water Act, the rule has been hailed by environmentalists. But farmers, ranchers and real estate developers oppose it as an infringement on their property rights. Republicans in farm states cheered the administration’s move on Wednesday. “The Obama administration’s outrageous Waters of the United States rule would have put backyard ponds, puddles, and farm fields under Washington’s control,” said Senator John Barrasso, the Wyoming Republican who is chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. “Today’s action will give Wyoming’s ranchers, farmers, small businesses, and communities clarity.” Environmentalists, meanwhile, assailed the move and vowed to sue the administration. “The Clean Water Rule protects the bodies of water that feed the drinking water supply for one in three Americans,” said Jon Devine, a senior attorney with the National Resources Defense Council. “E.P.A. Administrator Scott Pruitt is racing the clock to deny protections for our public health and safety.

But 70 years later, the base now home to the U.S. Strategic Command which deters ""catastrophic actions from adversaries and poses an immediate threat to any actor who questions U.S. resolve by demonstrating our capabilities"" isn't safe from historic and record-setting floods.

NASA noted that exceptionally cold Arctic blasts (from a wobbly polar vortex) preserved bounties of snow that soon rapidly melted when ""unusually warm"" March air produced massive amounts of runoff. Exacerbating matters, the winter's freeze made the ground less absorbent when extreme downpours then slammed the region.

If that wasn't enough, big rains in 2018 had already ""loaded the dice even more,"" meteorologist Bryce Anderson noted on Twitter: A thawed ground, already saturated with water, wouldn't have been able to soak up much water anyway, he said
On top of this confluence of extreme weather events, Earth's atmosphere is considerably different than it was a century ago. Specifically, the climate has warmed by 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit), and due to simple physics, the warmer air is able to hold more water vapor. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius of warming, the air can hold seven percent more water.
That means more intense downpours. Between 1958 and 2012, the amount of rain in the heaviest rainfall events in the midwest shot up by 37 percent, according to U.S. government scientists.
Forthcoming research will reveal the role climate change played during these floods, though atmospheric scientists expect this same climate lever to bring more intense precipitation blasts to other parts of the nation in the near future, notably California.

On Friday, Mr. Trump said he would be placing a call to the Saudi king. Nobodys been able to put it all together, Mr. Trump said to reporters. Mr. Fleischer said the presidents comments in real time about the situation were not a danger. Instead, he said, they reveal the timing and the pace of what hes thinking. But not everyone who has served at the White House podium thinks the window into Mr. Trumps psyche comes without risk. The only problem with a president who talks too much is that he might make his ignorance obvious, said Mike McCurry, who served as press secretary under President Bill Clinton. Thats why presidents get briefed, rehearse talking points, do practice sessions before facing the media and generally never do what Trump does, which is to wing it. With the news media in Washington barely keeping up with a president who speaks wherever he goes, fatigue may be showing through outside the capital: The sheer frequency of the presidents rallies, and the repetitive speeches he gives, appear to have strained some viewers patience.

ELLEN R. WALD,"But because the country lacks business experience and special expertise outside of the oil and petrochemical industries, that wont be possible without foreign and particularly American participation. Thats why the Saudis have been making so many deals recently: The Public Investment Fund has partnered with AMC to open and run movie theaters across the country because AMC knows how to manage cinemas. Saudi Arabia is pursuing deals for Snap and Amazon to open facilities in the kingdom because they can offer tech opportunities. Its not just the private sector. The Saudi government bureaucracy also relies heavily on American management expertise. Riyadh has been hiring American consultants since the 1950s, and in recent years American firms like McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Oliver Wyman have worked on hundreds of projects for the kingdom. In some cases, Saudi government bureaucrats work side by side with these consultants to implement government programs. The Saudi Public Investment Fund the kingdoms sovereign wealth fund, which is estimated to have more than $250 billion in assets is also closely tied to the American economy. To name just a few of its major investments: It put $3.5 billion into Uber in 2016 and almost half a billion dollars in the start-up Magic Leap this year; it invested $45 billion in SoftBanks Vision Fund, which invests heavily in American technology start-ups; and it made a $5 billion investment with a possible growth to $20 billion in a Blackstone fund for United States infrastructure. Much of the tens of billions of dollars cannot be pulled out on a whim. These start-ups are private companies without open markets for their shares. Prince Mohammed is building a domestic reputation with this tech portfolio, so its success is politically important, too. All of this is at risk if the dispute worsens between Saudi Arabia and the United States over Mr. Khashoggis disappearance. Not only could the Saudis not retaliate because their economy is so intertwined with that of the United States, but they will also be susceptible to pressure. Targeted sanctions if it comes to that could force consultants to withdraw or cut off the Saudi Public Investment Funds access to the profits of its investments. More likely, though, is that a continuing dispute would force American businesses like AMC to seriously reconsider involvement in the country because of negative publicity. What about oil? Whereas Saudi Arabia could once shock the world economy by cutting oil exports or production to raise prices, it no longer has that power. The oil market today is significantly more diverse than it was in 1973, when Saudi Arabia and other Arab petroleum exporters unilaterally raised the price of oil and unsettled the American economy. In fact, the United States now produces more oil than Saudi Arabia, and imports make up a smaller percentage of domestically refined crude oil.","Ignore the bluster from Riyadh.

LIAM STACK,"We have always believed and stated that with the proper investigation and looking at all the facts and circumstances surrounding the shooting, Officer Shelby would be cleared, she said in an email. First, by the jury and now the Department of Justice.
Ms. Shelby was found not guilty of manslaughter in connection with Mr. Crutchers death in Tulsa County District Court in May 2017. She was placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting and left the Police Department after she was acquitted.
Soon after, she began working as a reserve deputy for the Rogers County Sheriffs Office, about 30 miles from Tulsa, the sheriff, Scott Walton, said in an interview.
Last week she became a full-time employee stationed at the courthouse, the sheriff said. He said he had no reservations whatsoever about hiring her.
She has done a fine job and I am thankful to have her as part of our operation, Mr. Walton said. Im not trying to be a cowboy here, I am just saying Betty continues to do her job and it is certainly my opinion that she served the community in Tulsa well.
Mr. Solomon-Simmons said he was alarmed by the prospect of Ms. Shelby continuing to work in law enforcement.

ADAM LIPTAK,"This is true because robbery that must overpower a victims will even a feeble or weak-willed victim necessarily involves a physical confrontation and struggle, Justice Thomas wrote. The altercation need not cause pain or injury or even be prolonged; it is the physical contest between the criminal and the victim that is itself capable of causing physical pain or injury. 
The quoted phrase came from a 2010 decision, Johnson v. United States, that concluded that convictions under Floridas battery statute did not qualify as violent felonies for purposes of the federal sentencing law.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who generally votes with the courts liberal wing in closely divided cases, joined the majority opinion on Tuesday, as did Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, saying the majority opinion could not be reconciled with the 2010 decision or the reality of how little force is required to be convicted of robbery under the Florida law.
A pickpocket who attempts to pull free after the victim catches his arm qualifies, she wrote. A thief who grabs a bag from a victims shoulder also commits Florida robbery, so long as the victim instinctively holds on to the bags strap for a moment.
Justice Sotomayor added that locking up such offenders for long periods does not advance public safety. Under Florida law, robbers can be glorified pickpockets, shoplifters and purse snatchers, she wrote.

VIVIAN YEE,"BEIRUT, Lebanon A car bombing targeted a joint American-Kurdish patrol in Syria on Monday, injuring a number of fighters but no Americans, a spokesperson for the American-led coalition said.
The explosion came just five days after at least 15 people, including four Americans, were killed in a suicide bombingby the Islamic State in Manbij, Syria, which is controlled and protected by American-backed local forces.
Coming only weeks after President Trump ordered American troops to withdraw from Syria, the deadly attack served as a reminder that the Islamic State, while controlling just a small fraction of the territory it once had, was still capable of striking in what was considered relatively safe territory.
The Islamic State, which often claims responsibility for attacks, did not make a direct claim immediately after the bombing on Monday. The Amaq News Agency, which is linked to the militant group, reported that a suicide bomber had attacked a convoy of United States troops and Syrian Democratic Forces in what it called a martyrdom attack, but it did not attribute the explosion to any group.","Several members of a Kurdish-led force were wounded in the blast in the country’s northeast, days after four Americans died in an Islamic State bombing.",2019-01-21T14:30:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Bombing in Syria Targets U.S.-Led Military Patrol,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/world/middleeast/syria-attack-us-troops.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/22/world/22Syria2/22Syria2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1

ANNIE KARNI and NICHOLAS CASEY,"But in the short run, they are meant to end the arrangement by which the Maduro government provides oil to Cuba in exchange for intelligence and counterintelligence services while the Venezuelan people lack food, medicine and clean water. Venezuela has been shipping 20,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba, according to experts in the oil industry and administration officials.
Russ Dallen, the managing partner of Caracas Capital Markets, who specializes in the Venezuelan oil industry, said the most likely outcome of the sanctions would be to create an atmosphere in which shipping companies would be even more wary of doing business with either Cuba or Venezuela, for fear of triggering sanctions.
He said they were also meant to name and shame companies that have transported Venezuelan oil to Cuba so that Mr. Maduro can help an ideological ally rather than use profits from the oil to feed a starving population.
It makes Cuba and Venezuela even more radioactive, he said.
Mr. Dallen, who tracks oil shipments leaving Venezuela, said that some of the ships had begun turning off their transponders when in Venezuelan ports, something regulations prohibit but is a technique used in countries like Iran to conceal their presence in the country. One ship, Mr. Dallen said, had recently left its transponder off until it reached Europe.

Unlike those living in the gated complex, the immigrants here are mainly Central American, Mexican and Haitian.
A number of staffing company offices discreet, sometimes with mirrored glass windows are tucked into strip malls. Here, workers can submit applications to be placed on job sites, sometimes the same day.
Staffing companies were originally intended to serve as external human resource departments, supplying temporary workers and handling their paperwork, according to Richard Celler, an employment lawyer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. But now, Mr. Celler said, its morphed. He said employers had come to run their regular workers through the companies to cut the cost of workers compensation insurance and to narrow their liability.
Its the outsourcing of labor, he said.
There is another important advantage.
Greg Schell, a lawyer based in Lake Worth, Fla., who represents farmworkers and other migrant workers, said that as employers have faced increased scrutiny from federal authorities over hiring undocumented labor, they have turned to staffing companies, some of which engage in careful immigration verification, some of which do not. These companies enable many Florida farms and golf resorts, which can have difficulty finding legal workers, to maintain large work crews without assuming legal responsibility for their immigration status, Mr. Schell said.
The whole concept is to have someone else bear the responsibility, he said.
Not long ago, groundskeepers and golf maintenance workers were directly employed at the Trump properties in Florida and frequently moved between them, according to former employees.

NEIL IRWIN and EMILY BADGER,"Although some of the areas with declining demographics are hostile to immigration, others, cities as varied as Baltimore, Indianapolis and Fargo, N.D., have embraced the strategy of encouraging it.
One of the key solutions is to welcome immigrants into these communities, said Brooks Rainwater, director of the National League of Cities Center for City Solutions.
Many parts of the country that are growing in population and that are more economically dynamic have depended on the arrival of immigrants for that success.
Sun Belt metros like Dallas and Phoenix have been built on the logic of rapid expansion of quickly built homes, of poached employers, of new highways paved to ever-newer subdivisions. Their economic development strategy is growth. Their chief input is people the more, the better.
Growth cities need immigrants to continue their growth, said Joel Kotkin, executive director of the Houston-based Center for Opportunity Urbanism, which promotes policies to help cities grow. The older historically declining cities need immigrants to reinvigorate their economies. And the expensive cities need them because, frankly, white people, African-Americans and middle-class people are leaving for more affordable areas.
As many industrial cities have lost population since the mid-20th century, Americans have built whole new metropolises on land that was virtually empty then. The Las Vegas metropolitan area, with more than two million people today, had barely 50,000 in 1950. 
Still, only about 3 percent of the countrys land is urbanized.
Americas metropolitan areas remain among the least dense in the world, said Sonia Hirt, a professor of landscape architecture and planning at the University of Georgia. Nationwide, the United States has less than one-third of the population density of the European Union, and a quarter of the density of China.","A road less traveled in Rutland, Vt., last spring.

Both men were cleared of possessing a firearm in pursuance of a violent crime. Mr. Taylor’s defense team and his relatives did not immediately speak to reporters after the verdict. Much of the testimony during the trial focused on Gun Trace Task Force members who had pleaded guilty, including the unit’s onetime supervisor, Sgt. Wayne Jenkins. He was portrayed as leading his unit on a tireless quest to shake down civilians and find “monsters” — big-time drug dealers with lots of loot to steal. His subordinates testified that officers were told to carry BB guns in case they ever needed to plant weapons and that they occasionally posed as federal agents when shaking down targets. Former colleagues said Mr. Jenkins’s sledgehammer approach to policing extended to having actual sledgehammers — along with crowbars, grappling hooks, black masks and even a machete — stored in his police-issued car to ramp up illegal activities. The task force has been disbanded. It is not clear when Mr. Jenkins and the other former detectives who pleaded guilty will be sentenced by a federal judge. Four ex-officers testified for the government in hopes of shaving years off their sentences. The defense teams for Mr. Hersl and Mr. Taylor had asked jurors to doubt the motivations of the government’s witnesses, including a number of convicted drug dealers who received immunity for their testimony. Mr. Schenning said he was thankful the jurors saw through that. “That was the business model for this organization: They thought if you rob drug dealers they have no place to go,” he said. Mr. Purpura did not deny that his client took money but said the thefts did not rise to the more serious charges of robbery or extortion. The two defense teams also attacked the truthfulness of the four disgraced detectives, noting that they had admitted to lying for years to juries, judges, colleagues and their families. Assistant United States Attorney Leo Wise reminded jurors that the central question in the trial involved the actions of the rogue police unit and that whether some of its robbery victims made money “selling drugs or Girl Scout cookies” was irrelevant. Public defenders say there could be a few thousand tainted cases stretching back to 2008 involving the jailed members of the Gun Trace Task Force. So far, roughly 125 cases involving the eight indicted Baltimore police officers have been dropped. “Beyond the sheer credibility issues that should have been raised at the time, given how embedded their crimes were in their police work, all cases involving these officers are tainted,” said Debbie Katz Levi, head of special litigation for Baltimore’s Office of the Public Defender.

MICHAEL COOPER,"“There was probably a natural conflict there,” David Gockley, who led the San Francisco Opera and Houston Grand Opera, said in a telephone interview, “because Peter inherited a music director god in his last years of real productive work because of all those illnesses that he had. And I’m sure that was frustrating, to have to continue to make a place for James Levine in the structure.” A Met official, who was granted anonymity to discuss a case in litigation, said that the relationship between the two men only soured when Mr. Levine’s health deteriorated and Mr. Gelb moved to get him to step down as music director in 2016 — something that Mr. Levine’s lawsuit complains about at length The path to change his status was cleared by a 2015 agreement (included as an exhibit in the suit) in which Mr. Levine extended his contract as music director through the summer of 2019. As music director he was paid $700,000 a year, plus $50,000 for travel and expenses, and $27,000 per performance — more than the $17,000 that the Met usually describes as its top fee. (Mr. Levine’s contract prohibited the Met from paying anyone more than him for performances, unless he agreed.) Photo Mr. Gelb working on his computer during a rehearsal at the Met in 2015. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times The 2015 agreement, which came after years of health problems and cancellations, allowed the Met to make him music director emeritus should he be unable to perform his duties. During that season, 2015-16, Mr. Levine grew erratic at the podium, where the Met had previously built an elevator to accommodate his wheelchair. Musicians and singers said in interviews at the time that he had become hard to follow. But when Mr. Gelb spoke to Mr. Levine about transitioning to emeritus status, he resisted. “Astoundingly,” the lawsuit states, Mr. Gelb invited a reporter for The New York Times to attend a meeting with Mr. Levine and his neurologist, Dr. Stanley Fahn, that winter. The doctor said at the meeting that Mr. Levine’s most serious problems could probably be solved by adjusting the medication he was taking for his Parkinson’s disease. But in April 2016, the lawsuit says, Mr. Gelb “unilaterally forced Levine to step down as music director.” The lawsuit accuses the Met of issuing a public statement in Mr. Levine’s name that “suggested that Levine agreed with the decision to stop serving as music director, even though Levine emphatically disagreed.” As Mr. Levine’s health showed signs of improvement, he continued to conduct, and was given high-profile assignments by Mr. Gelb. Last December, after the Met suspended Mr. Levine and launched an investigation into accusations of sexual abuse that had appeared in articles in The Times and The New York Post, Mr. Levine’s lawyers sent a letter to Ann Ziff, the chairman of the Met’s board. The suit says the letter denied the allegations and demanded that the Met lift his suspension and allow him to conduct the remaining performances he had been scheduled to lead this season. Mr. Levine claims he did not get a response. Photo Mr. Levine in the orchestra pit at the Met in 2014, not long before conducting his 2,500th performance with the company. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times The relationship that is now shattered began decades ago. Mr. Gelb, who was an usher at the Met when he was a teenager, worked with Mr. Levine as a producer of the Met’s telecasts in the 1980s. Both men were greatly influenced by Ronald A. Wilford, who was Mr. Levine’s powerful manager as well as a mentor and former employer of Mr. Gelb’s. (He died in June 2015 at 87.) Mr. Gelb became the Met’s general manager in 2006, and arrived as a change agent at the company Mr. Levine had guided for decades. He began staging works by composers Mr. Levine had previously shown little interest in; championing new and sometimes controversial production styles; and launching the Met’s “Live in HD” simulcasts to cinemas. The suit charges that Mr. Gelb was trying to “create a Met in his own image, even though he had no artistic qualifications to do so,” and that Mr. Gelb had long wanted to “replace Levine with a younger conductor.” (Yannick Nézet-Séguin, 43, will become music director next season.) The suit claims the Met had no right to terminate Mr. Levine “based on allegations of misconduct or wrongdoing by him, least of all for conduct that predates the agreements.” His contract did not contain a so-called “morals clause,” though Mr. Gockley, the impresario, said that such clauses are “totally standard” at many performing arts organizations. Now the issue of whether Mr. Levine could be fired for what the Met called “sexually abusive and harassing conduct toward vulnerable artists in the early stages of their careers, over whom Mr. Levine had authority,” is headed for court.

Sidney Fussell,"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a new task force Wednesday dedicated to studying the social impact of algorithms on the public. The Automated Decision Systems Task Force will produce a report in December 2019 examining algorithms used across the public sector, making recommendations for how agencies can use them more transparently and make them more understandable for those impacted. While the technologies of major corporations like Facebook or Google are protected under a host of proprietary and trade-secret laws, states do have authority to push for public agencies to open up more about how their algorithms work. Many public agencies rely on such systems. The NYC Fire Department, for example, has used algorithms when deciding which of the city’s buildings to inspect for fire safety. Students are assigned to public schools in part because of the city’s student-matching system. And, of course, the New York Police Department relies on a suite of advanced technical systems, from facial recognition to body cameras. “As data and technology become more central to the work of city government, the algorithms we use to aid decision making must be aligned with our goals and values,” Mayor de Blasio said in a statement. “The establishment of the Automated Decision Systems Task Force is an important first step towards greater transparency and equity in our use of technology.” The law creating the Task Force, first proposed by former chair of the City Council Committee on Technology, James Vacca, passed in December 2017. New York is the first state to create such a task force. It should be noted, however, that the Task Force is an interdisciplinary mix of scholars, computer scientists, and legal experts. They have not been granted enforcement power to penalize agencies that don’t comply or are found to rely on outdated or biased algorithms. The Task Force’s co-chairs are Emily W. Newman, acting director of the Mayor’s Office of Operations, and Brittny Saunders, deputy commissioner for Strategic Initiatives at the NYC Commission on Human Rights. The remaining Task Force members include: Solon Barocas, Assistant Professor, Cornell University Shelby Chestnut, National Organizing and Policy Strategist, Transgender Law Center Khalil Cumberbatch, Associate Vice President for Policy, The Fortune Society Judith H.

ALI WATKINS,"The strike force was also part of a separate September indictment against nine people accused of being members of a Chicago street gang, the Four Corner Hustlers. The charges against them ranged from racketeering to murder. “Everybody knows why it’s there and what we’re there doing,” Frank Kelsey, an A.T.F. spokesman, said of the strike force. “We want to make sure that we give it our full attention.” At the bureau, the task force is seen as an experimental evolution of its Crime Gun Intelligence Center, which puts gun tracing technology and databases in communities around the country. The task force added a team of gun-focused agents to that effort to make it operational and to work with local officers. It echoes a similar A.T.F. strategy employed in the Bronx, where bureau agents and New York Police Department officers work on a joint team focused on targeting armed robberies in some of New York’s most dangerous neighborhoods. Three law enforcement officials said the wounded agent, who is not being named because he is undercover, was working on a significant case for the strike force. They declined to discuss details. Federal prosecutors charged Ernesto Godinez, 28, on Tuesday with assaulting a federal officer in the shooting, which was described by multiple law enforcement officials and in court documents. “He is not the shooter,” said Mr. Godinez’s lawyer, Lawrence Hyman.

Magheracloone Mitchells GAA's chairman Francis Jones said the complex in County Monaghan was ""a non-runner"". The sinkholes are thought to have been caused by the partial collapse of a disused mine. The mine's owner said it was investigating the subsidence with the help of geologists. Monaghan County Council said a team was on site carrying out a risk assessment. A meeting involving Irish police, the council and mining company Gyproc, will take place later. Gyproc, which mines gypsum for the manufacture of plasterboard, said it was also assessing five properties near the football ground to see if they had been impacted. The sinkholes appeared overnight on Sunday, causing huge fissures in the pitches and large cracks in the clubhouse. Drumgossatt National School in Carrickmacross was evacuated.

The acidic water causes the erosion of the soluble rock layers beneath the surface - eventually creating cavernous spaces. The land above collapses into the cavity when it can no longer be supported.

"DAVE PHILIPPS, RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and SERGE F. KOVALESKI","“The Air Force tried to give him chances but he was just problem after problem after problem,” said Jessika Edwards, a former Air Force staff sergeant who worked with Mr. Kelley in 2011, near the end of his career. “He was a dude on the edge,” Ms. Edwards added, noting that he would appear at informal squadron social functions in all black and a black trench coat. “This is not just in hindsight. He scared me at the time.” Even after he left the military, he contacted her on Facebook with disturbing posts about his obsession with Dylann S. Roof, the Charleston mass murderer, and his target practices using dogs ordered online. Ms. Edwards said the military had tried counseling and tough love, but nothing seemed to work. When punished for poor performance, Mr. Kelley would cry, scream and shake with rage, vowing to kill his superiors, she recalled. His temper was so unsettling that she warned others in the squadron to go easy on him or he was likely to come back and “shoot up the place.” The Air Force, like the civilian world, is often ill-equipped to intervene before violence occurs. Though Mr. Kelley’s behavior raised flags, commanders say they have limited options until a crime is committed. Even then, the priority is more often on getting problem troops out of the military, giving little thought to the possible impact on society. After facing intense criticism for its failure to report Mr. Kelley, the Air Force has opened an investigation into the case and many questions remain about what more it could have done. For Mr. Kelley, the military was likely an encouraging option at first. His family had a tradition of going to Texas A&amp;M University: His grandfather, father and both siblings became Aggies. But growing up in New Braunfels, Tex., Mr. Kelley did not get the grades to attend one of the state’s top schools. Besides earning mostly C’s, he had amassed at least seven suspensions for insubordination, profanity, dishonesty and drugs, according to school records. The Air Force offered him a clean slate and the chance to prove himself. He enlisted right after high school in 2009. Based on above-average aptitude test scores, he was picked to become a fusion analyst — an intelligence specialist trained to interpret and communicate the latest information on enemy tactics. It promised a clear career path and a top-secret clearance. In the spring of 2010, after two months of basic training, he arrived at Goodfellow Air Force Base near San Angelo, Tex., for the rigorous six-month intelligence technical school. Graduating required passing a polygraph test and a background check to get a security clearance. Mr. Kelley washed out before graduation. The Air Force did not provide details on whether Mr. Kelley passed the required polygraph, which typically scrutinizes mental health, drug use, family issues and disruptive behavior. A military official briefed on Mr. Kelley’s Air Force record said only that he was cut from the school for “academic reasons.” Several airmen who went through school with Mr. Kelley said in a closed Facebook group viewed by The New York Times that he did not last long. Some remembered him being there only a few weeks. Photo Devin P. Kelley in a photo from the New Braunfels High School yearbook. He enlisted in the Air Force after graduation. “I didn’t even realize he was in for as long as he was,” one of them said. “I thought he was discharged in tech school, let alone retrained into a different career field.” Mr. Kelley’s next assignment was decidedly less demanding. Records show the Air Force made him a traffic management apprentice — a job that includes moving people and freight, and requires a minimal aptitude score. Still, he struggled. He was sent in 2011 to Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, and assigned to the 49th Logistics Readiness Squadron. Six days before he arrived, he had married 19-year-old Tessa Loge from his hometown — a move that allowed his new wife and her baby from another relationship to move into base housing with him, and gave him increased pay because he had dependents. At the base, Mr. Kelley worked in the receiving department, entering information on incoming supplies into a computer. He was smart enough, said Ms. Edwards, who worked in the same office, but he and his new wife fought constantly, and were being investigated by local child protective services for child abuse. His wife, who later divorced him, declined to comment. Mr. Kelley was so emotionally unstable and unfocused, Ms. Edwards said, that he often would not do his work. As punishment, superiors would give Mr. Kelley menial tasks, such as mopping or scrubbing toilets, which would send him into a rage, Ms. Edwards said. “He would get so upset and just keep saying, ‘I want to kill them.’” He was formally disciplined multiple times, she said, including for sneaking a gun onto the base in his car. The Air Force confirmed that Ms. Edwards served in the same squadron as Mr. Kelley, and that evaluations show he performed poorly. The squadron wrote up the airman for every infraction, Ms. Edwards said, laying a paper trail that would allow the Air Force to discharge him for poor performance. Before they could do that, in April 2012, Mr. Kelley was arrested and detained after he pointed a gun at his wife, hitting and choking her, and hit his baby stepson, fracturing his skull. His wife filed for divorce that year. While Mr. Kelley awaited court-martial, the Air Force sent him to a civilian psychiatric hospital in Santa Teresa, N.M., where, according to local emergency dispatch records, he was given medication for depression, anxiety and A.D.H.D., and was considered a “high risk patient.” On the night of June 7, 2012, Mr. Kelley escaped and made his way 12 miles south in the desert night to the El Paso bus station, and bought a ticket home. His counselor at the hospital called the police, according to a police report, warning that Mr. Kelley had talked about killing his chain of command in the Air Force and told other patients he had recently bought guns online. Mr. Kelley was quickly caught and kept in pretrial confinement before his court-martial because his commanders were concerned about the threats, according to Don Christensen, a retired colonel who at the time was the Air Force’s chief prosecutor. He pleaded guilty to two counts of assault and in November 2012 was sentenced to 12 months in confinement — a relatively light sentence. “A serious injury to a child is worth more than a year in confinement,” said Mr. Christensen, who is now president of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence in the military. Mr. Christensen said that during his military career he had seen service members receive the same punishment Mr. Kelley got for merely abusing over-the-counter cough medicine. The Air Force should have entered Mr. Kelley’s name into federal databases that bar convicted felons from purchasing firearms — but didn’t. That mistake allowed him to buy several guns over the next few years. Photo Mr. Kelley returned to his parents’ home in New Braunfels, Tex., after receiving a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force. Credit Jonathan Bachman/Reuters Air Force officials apologized last week after admitting that in recent years an unknown number of violent criminals were never registered with the system. “We’re looking at all of our databases,” the Air Force secretary, Heather Wilson, said. After his guilty plea, Mr. Kelley served just eight months in military prison. In June 2013 he was let out, having been knocked down to the lowest possible rank and given a bad conduct discharge that barred him from nearly all veterans benefits, including mental health treatment. He went back to New Braunfels. Though his parents owned a sprawling ranch house with a patio and pool, he moved into their barn. He married again in 2014, to 19-year-old Danielle Shields. “That’s where things started to get weird,” said Ms. Edwards, who reconnected with Mr. Kelley around that time when he called asking for a job reference. They started chatting occasionally on Facebook, she said, and his posts grew gradually more disturbing until she finally stopped communicating with him this year. At first, Mr. Kelley shared photos of his children and small updates, she said. Then he started complaining about his new wife, and about how his family was trying to get him to take medication. He said he hated his wife, but feared she would leave, taking the children, Ms. Edwards said. Law enforcement officials said their rocky relationship may have contributed to the shooting on Sunday. A friend of Mr. Kelley’s mother-in-law, Todd Feltner, said Friday that the marriage was strained because, “Devin was abusing her physically, verbally and mentally.” He added that the mother-in-law told him that Mr. Kelley had threatened her family, too. “He was telling her ‘that he was going to get them.’” Soon, Mr. Kelley’s Facebook conversations turned dark. He started sending Ms. Edwards photos of weapons he had purchased and descriptions of killing animals. At first, she brushed it off as the enthusiasm of a hunter in the Texas hill country. But then, she said, he became obsessed with news of Dylann Roof, the 21-year-old who killed nine people in a church in South Carolina in 2015. “He was excited about it. He went on and on and on about it, saying ‘Isn’t it cool? Isn’t it cool?’ Have you watched the videos?’” Ms. Edwards said. She said she told Mr. Kelley that he wasn’t acting normal, and needed help. “He told me he would never have the nerve to kill people, he only killed animals,” she said. In 2016 he sent her photos of a new military-style rifle he was building — one that she said looked like the rifle the authorities said he used in the church shooting. This spring, Mr. Kelley’s comments became so disturbing that she unfriended him — something a number of his other friends also said they did, too. The breaking point came when he told her he was buying dogs online and using them as target practice. “I told him this was not normal, and he needed the kind of help I could not give him,” Ms. Edwards said. “Before I unfriended him, I gave him my number. I told him, ‘if you ever are thinking about hurting yourself or someone else just call.’” He never called. Now she, like many others in his path, says she can’t help but blame herself for not acting when she saw signs of trouble. On Sunday, she was washing dishes at home when another member of their old squadron texted her. “The shooter, it’s Kelley,” the text said. She dropped the glass in her hands and started crying.

MICHAEL D. SHEAR and KATIE BENNER,"Mr. Miller, 32, had gone from California to Duke University. While a student, he met David Horowitz, a right-wing provocateur and the founder of Students for Academic Freedom, which opposed progressive thought on college campuses. After Mr. Miller graduated, Mr. Horowitz helped him get a job with Michele Bachmann, then a Republican congresswoman from Minnesota, and recommended him highly to Mr. Sessions. Together Mr. Miller and Mr. Sessions often drew on the work of anti-immigration groups like the Federation for American Immigration Reform, NumbersUSA and the Center for Immigration Studies — some of which are derided as hate groups by immigration activists and civil rights organizations. The Southern Policy Law Center, which tracks white nationalists and other hate groups, describes FAIR as having “a veneer of legitimacy” that “hides much ugliness.” By 2013, Stephen K. Bannon, then the head of Breitbart News, invited Mr. Miller and Mr. Sessions to a dinner at the Capitol Hill townhouse that served as the headquarters for the conservative news outlet. The three bonded over an article titled “The Case of the Missing White Voters,” foreshadowing the case they would help Mr. Trump build during his presidential campaign. Later that year, Mr. Sessions and Mr. Miller worked tirelessly to defeat a bipartisan immigration bill. The senator spent hours on the floor arguing with his colleagues while Mr. Miller churned out a nonstop flurry of news releases.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"While we appreciate this bipartisan effort, the measure may actually give presidents more power to decide when, where and against whom Americans can fight, by approving existing military operations that began without congressional approval, and by allowing presidents to expand that scope of action with only a minimal role by Congress. That’s a concern no matter who occupies the White House but especially when the president is as impulsive as Mr. Trump. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee needs to hold hearings to examine publicly how the measure can be modified to ensure there is a more effective congressional check on the president’s ability to begin military operations so that the war on terrorists isn’t used as cover to fight any enemy, anywhere. During the Vietnam War, Congress tried to reclaim some of its clout by passing the 1973 War Powers Act, which mandated that if a president sent troops into “hostilities,” they could stay only 60 to 90 days unless Congress approved the deployment or extended the time period. In recent years, executive branch lawyers have concluded that presidents may act unilaterally if they decide that a strike would be in the national interest and that it would fall short of an all-out war involving ground troops. Congress, reluctant to be held accountable for putting troops in danger, and wary of challenging presidents, largely acquiesced. That is until the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when Congress passed an Authorization for the Use of Military Force to cover American-led operations against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. In 2002 it passed a second authorization, to cover the war in Iraq. Although 17 years have passed since the attacks on the United States, President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump, defying credibility, kept using the same authorizations to justify operations against the Islamic State and other groups that didn’t even exist in 2001 and to legitimize operations in many other countries, including Yemen, the Philippines, Kenya, Eritrea and Niger. Under the Kaine-Corker proposal, these 2001 and 2002 authorizations would be replaced with one that approves the use of force not just against Al Qaeda and the Taliban but also against six groups not in the 2001 authorization: the Islamic State, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the East African group Al Shabab, Al Qaeda in Syria, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Haqqani Network, which operates in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It would also increase the countries where force is authorized to include Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Libya.","A bipartisan bill prescribes when and where force can be used, but the terms are so broad that they may not limit presidential war-making.",2018-04-25T01:06:47Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Editorial: When Presidents Go to War,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/opinion/terrorism-congress-kaine-corker.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/25/opinion/25wed1/25wed1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1
ERIC SCHMITT,"It is the largest American military presence in the Horn of Africa nation since the Black Hawk Down battle in 1993, when 18 Army soldiers died. The military’s secretive Joint Special Operations Command has been particularly effective in building informant networks that lead to strikes. In turn, cellphones, laptop computers and documents captured after strikes generate information for additional attacks. Mr. Trump gave the military wider latitude this year to go after militants in Somalia, specifically those associated with the Shabab. The head of the Africa Command, Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, waited months before exercising the authorities, citing the difficulty of striking militants who are mixed with a civilian population that is on the move in the midst of a regional famine. “What’s going on now reflects the Trump administration’s desire to dial up the U.S. military effort, which has been increasing quietly for several months, combined with Shabab’s apparent intent to fight back as hard as it can,” said Michael R. Shurkin, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation and former C.I.A. analyst. “I just pray we’re bombing the right people.” Africa Command officials have investigated a handful of reports of civilian casualties in Somalia, but insist that the vast majority of strikes have targeted only insurgents. The deadly attack in Mogadishu last month spurred more aggressive strikes by the United States, which is working closely with Somali and other African forces on the ground, security analysts said. Tricia Bacon, a Somalia specialist at American University in Washington and a former State Department counterterrorism analyst, said the increase in strikes was probably the result of “better and more actionable intelligence,” meaning fresh tips about insurgents that commandos can act on immediately. Pentagon officials sought last week to play down any notion of a major American troop buildup or escalating operations in Somalia. They said it was more of a coincidence earlier this month that multiple painstaking efforts to identify, track and kill specific Shabab militants — without hurting civilians — all came together within a few days. “There’s no particular rhythm to it, except that as they become available and as we’re able to process them and vet them, we strike them,” Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the director of the military’s Joint Staff, told reporters last week. General McKenzie acknowledged that initial strikes can cause surviving militants to flee, making them more vulnerable to attack and creating a kind of chain reaction. “A strike produces movement, and other targets become available,” he said. Samantha Reho, a spokeswoman for the Africa Command in Stuttgart, Germany, said, “We’ve always stressed the importance of putting pressure on the network.” The intensifying operations have carried risks for American forces. In May, a Navy SEAL commando carrying out a raid with Somali troops was killed in an attack against Shabab fighters. Shabab militants are not the only extremists the United States is now striking in Somalia. The American military bombed Islamic State fighters in northern Somalia for the first time on Nov. 3, and again on Nov. 12, a sign that the air campaign against the group was expanding after recent battlefield successes against the insurgents in Iraq and Syria. A militant faction loyal to the Islamic State has increased its ranks in northern Somalia to as many as 200 fighters this year from a few dozen last year, according to a United Nations report issued this month. The increased militancy in the north has raised concerns among analysts that it could offer sanctuary for Islamic State militants fleeing defeat in Iraq or Syria. The increasing number of American airstrikes in Somalia has prompted some analysts, as well as Somalis, to voice concerns over the risks of civilian casualties, which could feed into the Shabab’s anti-Western propaganda. “Should civilian casualties happen, it’s to the advantage of the Shabab,” said Abdirahman Hassan Omar, a lawyer based in Mogadishu. In recent weeks, the American military’s presence across Africa has come under rigorous scrutiny. A team of Green Berets and support soldiers was ambushed, along with more than two dozen Nigerien troops, on Oct. 4 near the border of Niger and Mali by militants believed to be associated with the Islamic State. Four American soldiers were killed. In June, a Special Forces soldier, Staff Sgt. Logan J. Melgar, was found dead in his room in Bamako, Mali. It is unclear exactly how he died, but naval authorities are investigating whether two commandos from the Navy’s elite SEAL Team 6 strangled him. Hussein Mohamed contributed reporting from Mogadishu, and Mohamed Ibrahim from Helsinki, Finland.

 Hundreds of civilians and suspected militants have been evacuated from Baghuz
About 400 Islamic State militants have been captured trying to escape the last piece of land the group holds in Syria, a US-backed militia says.
A Syrian Democratic Forces commander said the jihadists were caught overnight as they attempted to slip out of Baghuz with the help of smugglers.
Hundreds of others have surrendered and been evacuated from the village with thousands of civilians in recent days.
It comes after US forces and the SDF stepped up their bombardment of Baghuz.
Once the village is taken, the US and its allies are expected to formally declare the end of the ""caliphate"" proclaimed by IS in 2014. 
The group once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching across Syria and neighbouring Iraq, imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people, and generated billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping.
After five years of fierce battles, local forces backed by world powers have driven IS out of all but a few hundred square metres near Syria's border with Iraq.
Last Friday, the SDF said it had launched its final assault on Baghuz, declaring that nothing remained in the village ""except for terrorists"".
After a weekend of intense air and artillery strikes, the alliance said it had to slow down the offensive ""due to a small number of civilians held as human shields"".
SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said about 3,000 people were evacuated on Monday and another 3,500, including 500 militants who surrendered, followed on Tuesday.

 Thousands of women and children have been evacuated since Monday
Five SDF fighters who had been held hostage by IS were also freed. But Mr Bali said the fate of other hostages - including the Italian priest Paolo Dall'Oglio and the Lebanese journalist Samir Kassab - remained unknown. 
On Wednesday, a further 2,000 people left Baghuz, Reuters news agency reported. They were taken to an SDF checkpoint where they were searched, questioned and given food and water.
Some of the women evacuated were defiant despite the situation, chanting ""God is greatest"" and ""Islamic State will remain"" as they passed reporters on the front line.
The women and their children from Baghuz, including many foreigners who travelled to Syria and Iraq to live under IS rule, will be transported by lorry to an SDF-controlled camp called al-Hol.
Media captionThe faces of the people abandoning IS's final territory in Syria
A humanitarian organisation warned on Wednesday that the situation at the camp, where more than 50,000 people have arrived since December, was ""completely overwhelming"". 
""Many of the arrivals are in a very weak condition or have life-changing injuries. Particularly vulnerable are the many heavily pregnant women as well as mothers with newborns,"" Misty Buswell of the International Rescue Committee said.
As of Monday, at least 90 people had died during the journey to al-Hol or shortly after reaching the camp, two-thirds of them babies and infants. 
Many of the children do not have shoes or coats, while some families have had to sleep outside due to a lack of tents, exposing them to the cold and rain.

VANESSA FRIEDMAN,"So what’s new about that? (To change it up a bit.) The fact that over the last few years “what’s next?” has also begun to mean something more in the fashion world. It has become a stand-in for the constant need for newness driven by technology and 24-hour communication; a nod to the need to speed deliveries and communications, to systematically rethink the interface between customer and company. What and when are the next product drops? The next Instagram story or newsletter? And coloring it all is the macro meaning: the groan with which people greet every news alert on their phones, the feeling of nauseous anticipation that arises upon every new headline. “What’s next?” meant in reference to the seemingly unpredictable course of global events: What new natural disaster is about to hit; what unexpected political event will unfold; what tweet will send ripples around the globe? What will fall from the sky to unsettle the consumer, disrupt exchange rates and demand new corporate strategy? Because these many layers of meaning cannot be disaggregated. People do not make purchases in a vacuum. They buy because they want to feel better, or they don’t buy because they are scared; or they do buy because exchange rates have fallen and suddenly everything is cheaper, or they don’t buy because it is more expensive; or they do buy because, well, time to make hay while the sun shines (or before the bombs fall), or they don’t buy because what they see seems irrelevant to their lives. What happens next in the world changes what needs to come next in luxury. And the tension between those poles is what defines decision-making today. So we asked a series of decision-makers to tell us “what’s next?” Here are their answers. Photo Jonathan Akeroyd of Versace. Credit Jacopo Raule/Getty Images Jonathan Akeroyd, the chief executive of Gianni Versace The luxury landscape has been changing for quite a while now and the element that has become most apparent is how it has gone from a brand-driven industry to a product-driven one. Brands can no longer rely solely on their image, positioning and status: this means that the offer and the entire productivity chain (from how the products are conceived and produced to the way they are communicated and sold), needs to adapt and be consistent with these changes. Sustainability, flexibility, responsibility, quality and engagement will be even more important than they are today. They will determine the success of a company in ways beyond what we already can foresee and, most importantly, they will give it the right language and attitude to connect to the new generation of luxury consumers. Photo Stephen H. Baum. Stephen H. Baum, a leadership coach It is likely that others have more data and insight than I do about macro factors and industrywide challenges or focus. Although guided by my belief that surviving and thriving in the next few years cannot be by business-as-usual, my expertise is in leadership. And that will be the greatest challenge. So, which C.E.O.s and senior team direct reports will succeed and which will falter? 1. Successful leaders will bring all their capacities to the playing field. — Those who falter will fail to challenge their own strongly held belief that is untrue or no longer true. — Those who falter will suffer a fear that drives avoidance of necessary actions or risk-taking and will let ego and emotion dwarf their own intuition. 2. Successful ones will bring all the resources in their ecosystem to bear. — Those who falter will be afraid to delegate to capable subordinates, will react negatively to thoughtful pushback. — Those who falter will avoid engaging outside resources to help, claiming frugality or confidentiality. — Those who falter will have no external personal board of directors. 3. Successful ones will stay focused on the end game. — Those who falter will get stuck in the details, overwhelmed, distracted by the “shiny new object.” — Those who falter will stay tactical and short term, preserving the status quo or past. — Those who falter will have an undisciplined involvement in nonstrategic activities, starving time from what only the C.E.O. can do Whether it is a coach, an outside mentor, a trusted H.R. chief, the only way humans become aware of these possibly temporary troubled mind-sets is to look in the mirror through someone else’s lens.

Credit Monica Schipper/Getty Images Alex Bolen, the chief executive of Oscar de la Renta In a sense, luxury’s greatest challenge is the same as it ever was: to be more and more relevant to customers and the way they lead their lives. Having said that, distinctions once critical to our engagement with customers seem less and less relevant. Lines between wholesale and direct-to-consumer trade, domestic and international business, physical and digital storefronts are increasingly blurred. In a crowded and transparent marketplace, we need to be constantly “top of mind” with our customers without seeming ubiquitous. Given all this, our greatest new focus will be increased personalization and customization of everything from product to content. To engage with a brand in a uniquely personal way is the ultimate luxury. Photo Geoffroy de la Bourdonnaye of Chloé. Credit Jacopo Raule/Getty Images Geoffroy de la Bourdonnaye, the chief executive of Chloé The world challenges include the climate, growing inequality, the aspiration for diversity, the rejection of a “one size fits all” global model, the re-emergence of identities, individualities, the aspiration for a more responsible consumption, the aspiration for a more feminine world. A more feminine world is a world which gives birth to new and beautiful ideas for sustainable growth, it is also a world which takes care of all individuals who feel disengaged. Therefore the luxury industry will continue to protect the welfare of all people participating in the creation, production and promotion of its products, will protect the environment while improving the traceability of its sourcing and will continue to pay attention to animal welfare. Finally, the role of the most accomplished brands will be to support and serve a larger community than just its clientele by encouraging the community towards a certain mission. Most brands carry missions which go beyond its products; e.g., Nike will encourage audacity, “Just do it!” Apple, simplicity and Chloé, “ freedom to be oneself.” Photo Alexander Gilkes of Paddle8. Credit Charley Gallay/Getty Images Alexander Gilkes, a co-founder of the auction house Paddle8 Beyond a global rise in austerity and digital disruption, the key challenge facing luxury brands is how to keep up with the unprecedented pace of the ever-evolving new luxury consumer. Unlike the previous generation who was romanced by the store experience and stories of craftsmanship, today’s consumer is turned off by the very word “luxury.” For them the term has connotations of elitism and exclusivity. Instead, they want a luxury that is inclusive, honest and democratic. For the new consumer, status is no longer about how much you can afford to spend on a good, but more about what you stand for and have achieved. They know how to acquire “luxury-quality” at a fraction of the price and seek to be entertained beyond the store and within the digital space. Their first point of contact with a brand is usually via the website or social media channel, which makes it imperative for brands to consider these channels as platforms for information and entertainment and not just commerce. They want brands to care about the values that are important to them such as sustainability. To keep ahead of this demand, luxury brands will have to focus on how best to enhance the digital experience. Will the advent of new technologies such as A.R. (augmented reality) create a new experience in personalization whereby the brand atelier can be brought into people’s homes? Photo Reed Krakoff of Tiffany &amp; Co. Credit Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Reed Krakoff, the chief artistic officer of Tiffany &amp; Co. Of great focus in the coming years will be the integration of luxury into everyday life, which will necessitate design inspired by function as well as beauty and craftsmanship. Further, with more understanding of the impact of our purchases — and in the case of luxury goods, the artisans who made them and the provenance of the materials — we’ll need greater transparency and storytelling on how our products came to be. Finally, we’ll see more and more personalization to reflect individual style, and a continued need to serve consumers seamlessly wherever they are. Photo Jean-Marc Loubier of First Heritage Brands. Credit Foc Kan/WireImage Jean-Marc Loubier, the president and chief executive of First Heritage Brands and executive chairman of Delvaux The history or the moment of luxury has always been turbulent. It has been turbulent for luxury to become an industry, and a very dynamic one, quite young still — more or less 40 years. It has been turbulent for luxury to become international. It has been turbulent for luxury to embrace many different products under the same “umbrella” (brands) and layers of clients (consumers). It is turbulent for luxury to cope with quantities, and now, as well, with different generations of people from different cultures. It is challenging to cope with confusion. Too many adjectives are tied to the word “luxury”: Accessible, ultimate, soft, hard — implying that most of luxury would be average? The simple word luxury itself is often misused (not to say mess-used) covering brands, products, or processes irrelevant to the necessary evolution of our society and our world. The challenge, though, is inspiring — and necessary in order to stay, or become, right. The answer is not to try to protect or come back to a better yesterday (which day?) nor to follow current trends where statements replace thinking and thoughts, where number of followers have more value than what you propose, or where thinking that “digital” will be a new world, when in fact there is only one world. We must accept and value complexity, and take uncertainty as a teaser to do better. Luxury has all the means to be a major reference as soon as it really mixes, in a sustainable way, legacy, know how, innovation, creativity, quality, beauty, fun, the unexpected, in concrete products and offers, always with the sense of integrity (towards itself) and the sense of respect (towards others). The beauty is that it is not about size but about strength. Besides, there is not one recipe, but several paths. That is why solid brands exist with their intangible substance and a long-term view. Photo Victor Luis of Tapestry. Credit Richard Drew/Associated Press Victor Luis, the chief executive of Tapestry, the new parent company of Coach, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade In an increasingly fast-paced world with more transparency than ever before, the need for continuous innovation and authenticity is paramount. Brands will continually have to balance innovation with authenticity to their D.N.A., especially in a time of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. This tension has always been present but is magnified with the power and transparency afforded by technology. After many years of attempted focus on all things digital, brands are realizing that consumers demand differentiated experiences across channels and we will continue to see innovation in brick-and-mortar store experiences as well as product co-creation with consumers (personalization and customization) taken to new levels.

Credit Kris Connor/Getty Images William McDonough, the chief executive of McDonough Innovation and a co-founder of MBDC, a sustainability consulting and product certification firm In a turbulent world with a widening divide between the have and have-nots, sustainability in luxury will move from being a “nice to have” to a “must have.” The new luxury will create heirlooms of gratifying value while simultaneously sustaining long-term economic, equitable and ecological values. Photo Nathalie Remy of McKinsey &amp; Co. Credit Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Nathalie Remy, a partner at McKinsey &amp; Co., the global management consulting company One of the industry’s main challenges is undoubtedly the emergence of a new generation of consumers, with unique sets of behaviors and expectations. Millennials, who are accustomed to very high standards of end-to-end service in other industries, will soon become its most important cohort of luxury clients and will put pressure on the traditional models. These “digital natives” consumers follow very different and fragmented decision journeys and are amassing more and more power relative to the brands. Yet, many luxury players fall short of offering them an enriched, personalized, seamless and digitally enabled experience able to conquer their hearts and minds. Through innovation and utmost personalization, brands must shape the 21st century luxury experience. They should leverage their unique assets and brand heritages but also reinvent their in-store experiences, with the help of new technology, and transpose them online. This calls for a complete shift of luxury brands’ approach to emotionally engage with their customers, starting by using data to provide a tailor-made experience across all touchpoints.

Rebecca Robins, the global director of Interbrand, a global brand consultancy While intelligence in business and in the world at large has changed exponentially, let’s never forget that brands are created by people for people.

Credit Kevin Tachman/WireImage Steve Shiffman, the chief executive of Calvin Klein The concept of luxury has been around for centuries, not only in physical products and experiences but also in people’s dreams. Today, luxury is not just about price. It means different things to different people. For some, it’s about having the best. For some, it’s about having better. It’s not enough for a brand to create a single definition of luxury — it has to be more democratic than that. Going forward, we won’t be able to define the luxury consumer based simply on demographics and income. We have to understand them much more personally, so that we can engage with consumers that care about what the brand stands for. And then we need to combine our creativity and state-of-the-art technology to create highly personalized experiences and products that make people feel special. I think that’s what luxury really is. A feeling that something is special. Photo Sonu Shivdasani of Soneva. Credit Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Sonu Shivdasani, founder and chief executive of the resort company Soneva The luxury Goods industry will need to manage with the fact that more and more disposable spending is now being spent on experiences rather than goods, as the cupboards are full and the garages are full and the affluent would now rather buy unique, memorable experiences. Traditionally, sustainability and luxury were opposites. Our key purpose at Soneva since we opened our first resort back in 1995 has been to prove that they are not, and that luxury and sustainability go hand in hand. At Soneva, we manage to offer our guests luxuries whilst minimizing our impact on the planet and enhancing their health. It is very good to see that over the last 10 years, other companies have adopted a similar belief, such as Kering. It is also good to see such revolutionary concepts like Tesla, which is not just as comfortable as a Merc, a Jaguar or a BMW, but also zero carbon in its operation. As we start to feel the impact of global warming and other environmental issues, low-impact consumption will become more and more important, especially for luxury brands. Photo Julie Wainwright of The RealReal. Credit Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Julie Wainwright, the founder and chief executive of The RealReal, an online luxury consignment store Success will come to those that keep a fresh, strong vision in design. This will put more pressure on the most creative designers to constantly reinvent themselves without losing continuity from a past season. Mid-tier luxury brands could disappear. U.S. luxury in particular will struggle unless designers reinvent themselves. Houses with a portfolio of brands in various states of reinvention will have a better chance of surviving than mono-brands. Luxury brands will create unique experiences in the retail world to entice and engage customers. Authenticity will win over flash or the slick branding of the early 2000s, which is still evident in most retail stores. Values will matter in fashion and integrating those values into the product lines will be really important — think Stella McCartney’s commitment to sustainable fashion or Alessandro Michele and Gucci’s recent commitment to be fur-free.

The rocket has three cores, or first-stage boosters, that work in unison to get the rocket into a low Earth orbit. There are two side boosters and a center core. SpaceX has designed the rocket so that after stage separation all three boosters will land and be able to be reused.

But they're more than just a piece of spectacle, because when it comes to the leader's security, North Korea leaves absolutely nothing to chance. Analyst Michael Madden explains more about this mysterious group of men. When in North Korea, Mr Kim's close body guard has three different lines that surround him. There's a modified version of this on display in Singapore and all eyes are on the men in dark suits. The bodyguards running alongside Mr Kim's limousine and those who walk in close proximity to him are part something called Central Party Office #6, or formally, it's known as the Main Office of Adjutants. They form the immediate line around Mr Kim and are selected from Korean People's Army (KPA) recruits fulfilling their national service conscription obligations. Criteria for selection includes a height requirement - they need to be approximately the same height as the supreme leader - and must not have any visual impairments. They must demonstrate certain accomplishments or a high aptitude for skills such as marksmanship - firing a gun - and martial arts.

Bodyguard trainees undergo physical endurance challenges, behavioural conditioning and physically rigorous drills. The bodyguards form a ring around him with the protective perimeter having a 360-degree view of both the people near him and the location. Walking, riding ahead, or in advance of Mr Kim are between three to five bodyguards including the director of the Main Office of Adjutants. Alongside him are between four to six bodyguards, with two to three on his right and left. Bringing up the rear are an additional four to five bodyguards. In a sign of their power in the regime, they are some of the only North Korean citizens permitted to carry loaded firearms next to their country's leader, usually a semi-automatic handgun and a back-up weapon. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The bodyguards were first seen running beside Mr Kim's motorcade at the inter-Korean summit in April Despite carrying firearms, the bodyguards main defence for Mr Kim are their skills of observation (of people near the leader and the premises), and neutralising any perceived threat with their hands and bodies. When Kim Jong-il was alive, there was a ratio of one bodyguard to two of the senior officials accompanying him. Kim Jong-un's bodyguards, in contrast to his father, are fewer in number and have a less obtrusive presence. Bodyguards are usually attired in Western-style suits and ties, as we see in Singapore, or the Zhongshan suits of party officials. Mr Kim's chauffeurs always wear linen or leather gloves to handle the steering wheel. They also use radio communications with earpieces. However, their primary communication methods are distinctly old school: they wear specific badges and pins on their clothing for a given event to establish their identification, and use a series of spoken passwords and code phrases. The Main Office of Adjutants has an estimated 200-300 personnel, of whom over half are bodyguards, and the remainder are drivers and technical staff. While some of the leader's bodyguards have long careers, most only work in that capacity for 10 years. The Guard Command (GC) comprises the second and third lines of security around Mr Kim. Whereas the Main Office of Adjutants protects the Supreme Leader himself, the GC is mainly responsible for securing the physical premises of wherever he happens to be, whether it's his office buildings, private residences or locations he visits domestically or outside North Korea. Image copyright Michael Madden/NKLW In addition to that, the GC fulfils a number of logistical or technical functions to support the leader in his job. Guard Command personnel undergo a similar selection and vetting process as Mr Kim's bodyguards in the Main Office of Adjutants. In fact most bodyguards rotate out of the latter department into the GC. Recent observation and reporting about Mr Kim's visit to Singapore noted that three planes arrived to the city state from Pyongyang. Guard Command personnel were on board at least two of these planes. These men and women are involved in a diverse number of support missions for Mr Kim. They will operate and maintain the secure telephone lines that the leader will use, as well as provide him with whatever computers he uses and IT security required. In addition to that, they have whatever liquors, foods, and cigarettes that Mr Kim will want during his time in Singapore, and will inspect any food or drink before it is served to him. It also has a medical department where his personal physicians and medical staff work, and at least two of these people are with him in Singapore. In terms of Mr Kim's personal security, the GC's #2 Department forms two of the three outer lines of security around him, and they normally focus on where Mr Kim works, stays or visits. The GC establishes one line immediately outside of the bodyguard group around him, followed by a third outer line near any roads, fences or other infrastructure within a half mile of any location. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption North Korean security personnel seen outside Mr Kim's hotel in Singapore If one were to pop down to the lobby of the St Regis hotel where he is staying in Singapore, one would most certainly encounter them. This three-tier personal security structure is virtually unheard of for any other world leader. And while the running bodyguards are a striking image, it is the additional and not immediately visible layers of security further out that are the most sophisticated and extreme in the lengths they will go to ensure the preservation of the Kim dynasty.

Rhett Allain,"It's tough being a parent. Sometimes I try to help my kids with their physics homework because I like to pretend that I'm sort of OK with physics. Recently, my daughter wanted me to check her answer for this question. Where do you weigh more, at the equator or at the North Pole? Oh boy. I'm not sure what answer to give. OK, I think I know the answer and I also think I know the answer that the teacher wants (and these two answers might not be the same). Really, it's not the best question. It's sort of ambiguous. Here are the thoughts that go through my head in my attempt at helping. What do you mean by ""weigh""? There are actually two common definitions of ""weigh."" Let me start with the most physics-like (and more technically correct) version. Weight : Weight is the magnitude of the gravitational force between an object and a planet (typically, the planet is the Earth). On the surface of the Earth, the weight of an object is approximately the product of object mass (m) and gravitational field (g) where g is 9.8 Newtons per kilogram. I tried to make that a formal definition—just to be complete. In short, weight is the gravitational force. Here is the other definition that could be used for weight. Weight : The reading a scale produces when you stand on it. But are those two definitions the same thing? Nope. Let me give you two situations with a human standing on a scale. In the first case, there is a human just standing on a scale (on a non-rotating planet for now). In this case, the human is stationary and not accelerating. This means that the total force on the human must be zero. There would be a downward pulling gravitational force and then there would be an upward pushing force from the scale (this is what the scale reads). These two forces have to have the same magnitude in order to add up to zero such that the scale force and the weight would be the same. In this case, it doesn't matter which definition of weight is used. Next case. Again, it's a human standing on a scale but this time the scale is in an elevator on the 9th floor. Yes, it's important that it's on the 9th floor. The human lets the elevator door close and then presses the button for the ground floor. Right after this, the elevator accelerates down for a short time. Since the human is accelerating down, there needs to be a net downward force. This means that the downward gravitational force must be greater than the upward pushing force from the scale. The scale will give a reading that is less than the gravitational force. So yes, it does indeed matter which definition of ""weight"" you want in this question. What changes when you move from the equator to the North Pole? The obvious change in going from the equator to the North Pole is your clothes—because it's probably quite a bit colder at the North Pole. Also, you might drown since there is no land up there, only ice (at least for now). But there is another difference between the two locations. At the equator, you would be moving around in a giant circle because the Earth rotates around its axis once a day (technically slightly less than 24 hours) while at the pole you just turn around in a zero radius circle. So, what does moving in a circle have to do with weight? Whenever you move in a circular motion, you accelerate—it's true. Just think back to the last time you were in a car going around a circle. You can feel the car accelerating as you get pushed towards the center of the circle the car is traveling in. An object moving at a constant speed and moving in a circle does indeed accelerate. The value of this acceleration points toward the center of the circle and increases with speed but decreases with increased radius. When you're at the equator, you are sort of like the human in the downward accelerating elevator. The force of gravity should be greater than the force of a scale in order to make the net force push towards the center of the Earth. So, here is your answer (probably). The gravitational force on the two humans (assuming equal mass) would be identical at both locations but the force from the scale would be greater at the North Pole. I suspect the ""correct"" answer to the question is that you ""weigh"" more at the North Pole. I hope I get that question right. But wait! The more I think about this question, the more uncertain of the correct answer I become. I need help. There are two things that might make a difference in this question. First, the Earth is not spherical. Instead, it is an oblate spheroid. This means that the Earth is wider at the equator than it is from North to South pole. The Earth is like a slightly (ever so slightly) squished ball. This non-spherical nature of the Earth means that the gravitational field (and thus the real weight) would be different at the pole vs. the equator. The second problem is that the Earth does not have a uniform density. This means that there is a variation in the gravitational field at different locations on the Earth. Oh sure, the change is small—but it's still there. If you are at a location on the equation near a mountain or some other place with higher than normal density, the weight will also be different. In the end, I'm not even sure how to answer this question. Maybe it was a bad idea to show it to me.",In which a physics professor very severely overthinks his daughter's science homework.,2018-04-05T14:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Do You Weigh More at the Equator or at the North Pole?,https://www.wired.com/story/do-you-weigh-more-at-the-equator-or-at-the-north-pole/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ac561a15d6b7160f7e186f4/191:100/pass/scale-111953044.jpg,wired,Wired,force,1

Rhett Allain,"This week, I settled down to watch the first episode of The 100. If you haven't seen the show, I'll just point out that it takes place in the near future (though it ran, on the CW, in the near past). For reasons that I won't get into, there is a spacecraft with a bunch of teenagers that is traveling from a space station down to the surface of the Earth. During the reentry process, one kid wants to show that he is the master of space travel and that he's awesome. So what does he do? He gets out of his seat and floats around as a demonstration of his mastery of weightlessness. Another teenager points out that he's being pretty dumb—and that he's going to get hurt very soon. OK, that is enough of the description of the scene so that we can talk about physics. The point is that there is one dude ""floating"" around in the spacecraft during reentry. Before I over-analyze this short scene, let me add a caveat about my philosophy on science and stories. I've talked about this before, so I'll just give a summary: The number one job for a writer of a show is to tell a story. If the writer distorts science in order to make the plot move along—so be it. However, if the science could be correct without destroying the plot, then obviously I'd prefer it. On to the over-analysis! What Causes Gravity? Obviously this scene has to do with gravity, so we should talk about gravity—right? In short, gravity is a fundamental interaction between objects with mass. Yes, any two objects that have mass will have a gravitational force pulling them together. The magnitude of this gravitational force depends on the distance between the objects. The further apart the objects get, the weaker the gravitational force. The magnitude of this force also depends on the masses of the two objects. Greater mass means a greater force. As an equation, this would be written as: In this equation, the masses are described by the variables m 1 and m 2 and the distance between the objects is the variable r. But the most important thing is the constant G —this is the universal gravitational constant and it has a value of 6.67 x 10 -11 Nm 2 /kg 2 2. That might seem like it's important, so let me give an example that everyone can relate to. Suppose you are standing somewhere and your friend is right there with you and you two are having a conversation. Since you both have mass, there is a gravitational force pulling the two of you together. Using rough approximations for distance and mass, I get an attractive force of 3 x 10 -7 Newtons. Just to put that into perspective, this value is fairly close to the force you would feel if you put a grain of salt on your head ( yes, I have an approximate value for the mass of one grain of salt ). So, the gravitational force is super tiny. The only way we ever notice this force is if one of the interacting objects has a super huge mass—something like the mass of the Earth (5.97 x 10 24 kg). If you replace your friend with the Earth and put the distance between you and your friend-Earth as the radius of the Earth, then you get a gravitational force of something like 680 Newtons—and that is a force you can feel (and you do). Is There Gravity in Space? Now for the real question. Why do astronauts float around in space unless there is no gravity? It sure seems like there is no gravity in space—it's even referred to as ""zero gravity."" OK, I've answered this before, but it's important enough to revisit the question. The short answer is ""yes""—there is gravity in space. Look back at the gravitational equation above. What changes in that equation as you move from the surface of the Earth into space? The only difference is the distance between you and the center of the Earth (the r ). So as the distance increases, the gravitational force decreases—but by how much does the gravitational force change? How about a quick estimation? Let's use an Earth radius of 6.371 x 10 6 meters. With this value, a person with a mass of 70 kg would have a gravitational force of 686.7 Newtons. Now moving up to the orbital height of the International Space Station, you would be an extra 400 km farther from the center. Recalculating with this greater distance, I get a weight of 608 Newtons. This is about 88 percent the value on the surface of the Earth ( you can check all my calculations here ). But you can see there is clearly gravity in space. Oh, here is some extra evidence. Why does the moon orbit the Earth? The answer: gravity. Why does the Earth orbit the Sun? Yup, it's gravity. In both of these cases, there is a significant distance between the two interacting objects—but gravity still ""works,"" even in space. But why do astronauts float around in space? Well, they float around when in orbit—if there was a super tall tower reaching into space, they wouldn't float around. The ""weightless"" environment is caused by the orbital motion of the people inside a spacecraft or space station. Here is the real deal. If the only force acting on a human is the gravitational force, that human feels weightless. Standing on a tall tower would result in two forces (gravity pulling down and the tower pushing up). In orbit, there is only the gravitational force—leading to that feeling of weightlessness. Actually, you don't even need to be in orbit to feel weightless. You can be weightless by having the gravitational force as the only thing acting on you. Here is a situation for you to consider. Suppose you are standing in a stationary elevator at the top of a building. Since you are at rest, the total force must be zero—that means the downward gravitational force pulling down is balanced by the upward pushing force from the floor. Now remove the force from the floor. Yes, this is difficult but it can be accomplished. Just have the elevator accelerate down with the same acceleration as a free falling object. Now you will be falling inside an elevator. The only force is gravity and you will be weightless. Some people think this falling elevator is fun. That's why many amusement parks have a ride like The Tower of Terror. Basically, you get in a car that drops off a tower. During the fall, you feel weightless—but you don't crash at the bottom. Instead, the car is on a track that somehow slows down more gradually than if it smashed into the ground. They have one of these types of rides at the NASA center in Huntsville. went on this with my kids—it was actually scarier than I had imagined. How about another example? If you are in an airplane and the plane flies with a downward acceleration, everyone inside will be weightless. Even a dog. Check it out. In the end, there seems to be huge misunderstanding about gravity. I believe the reasoning follows like so: Astronauts are weightless in space. There is no air in space. Therefore, if there is no air, there is no gravity. This no-air/no-gravity idea pops up all the time in movies (incorrectly so). Here's how you'll see it: Some dude is floating around in space (that's OK) and then he enters the airlock of a spacecraft, still floating. The airlock door shuts and air is pumped into the chamber and boom —he falls to the ground because now there's gravity. Here is what it should look like—from the epic movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. SPOILER ALERT: Hal is crazy and won't open the pod-bay doors. Not even for Dave. Wow. That scene is pretty much perfect. They even have no sound until the air comes in. What Happens During Reentry? Now back to the events in The 100. The scene doesn't take place in orbit, it occurs during reentry. This is the part where the spacecraft enters back into the atmosphere and encounters an air resistance force (because there is air). Let me start with a simple force diagram showing the spacecraft at some point during this motion. Clearly, this not weightless. Yes, there is a gravitational force acting on everything—but there is also that air drag force that will make the spacecraft slow down as it moves down. If the human is going to stay inside the spacecraft, there must also be an extra force on that human (from the floor). So, not weightless—in fact, the human would feel more than normal gravity because of the acceleration. You already know this, though, because the exact same thing happens to you in an elevator. As the elevator is moving down and coming to a stop, it is also slowing down. During this time, you would feel a little bit heavier because of the force from the floor pushing on you. You aren't really heavier, you just feel that way because of the acceleration. Again, there is another movie example where someone gets this reentry physics right. It's from Apollo 13. Check it out. Notice the water falling from the ceiling. In this case, the capsule is moving downward at an angle. However, the air resistance force is pushing in the opposite direction of motion causing the spacecraft to slow down. But what slows down the water? The water does cling to the surface a little bit—but the acceleration is too much to keep it there and it ""falls"" towards the astronaut. Note that ""falling"" here doesn't mean straight towards the surface of the Earth but rather just in the opposite direction as the acceleration. Looking back at the scene from The 100, here's how they could fix the scene—and it's pretty simple. Have the bold floating guy move around before they get to reentry. Then the other guys fall as soon as the spacecraft starts to interact with the atmosphere. That wouldn't even change the plot—and it would be more scientifically accurate.",Movies and TV shows often assume that no air = no gravity.

About 1,500 children are held in detention in Iraq and the country's Kurdish-run areas for alleged links to Islamic State, Human Rights Watch says.
In a report, it says the suspects are often arbitrarily arrested and tortured to force confessions.
HRW urges the Iraqi and Kurdish authorities to amend anti-terror laws to end such detentions, saying they violate international law.
Iraq and the Kurdish authorities have so far made no comment.
The Kurdish government has previously rejected an HWR report which alleged that children were being tortured to confess to IS links. 
In January, an official said the local authorities' policy was to ""rehabilitate"" such children; torture was prohibited; and children were afforded the same rights as other prisoners. 
What did the HRW report say?
The 53-page report says that at the end of 2018 the Iraqi and Kurdish authorities were holding about 1,500 children for alleged IS links.
At least 185 foreign children have been convicted on terrorism charges and sentenced to jail terms, HRW is quotes the Iraqi government as saying.
The HRW document alleges that the local authorities:
Often arrest and prosecute children with any perceived connection to IS
Use torture to coerce confessions and
Sentence suspects in hasty and unfair trials
""This sweeping, punitive approach is not justice, and will create lifelong negative consequences for many of these children,"" said Joe Becker, children's rights advocacy director for HRW.
What cases does HRW cite?
Last November, the report says, HRW interviewed 29 children held for alleged IS affiliation.
It says that 19 of the suspects reported that they had been tortured, including beatings with plastic pipes, electric cables or rods.
One of the children, a 17-year-old boy in Iraqi detention, said he was repeatedly suspended by his wrists for 10 minutes at a time, according to the report.
It also points out that most of those interviewed said they had joined IS because of economic need, peer or family pressure.
Some cited family problems or a desire to gain social status.
HRW says that those Iraqi children who have been released are afraid to return home because of the stigma of IS membership and a threat of revenge attacks. 
The human rights group stresses that international law recognises children recruited by armed groups primarily as victims who should be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.","The children are often arbitrarily held and tortured to force confessions, Human Rights Watch says.",2019-03-06T05:13:02Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}","Iraq and Kurds hold 1,500 IS child suspects - HRW report",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-47464315,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AA8C/production/_105906634_502e6a78-f27f-4e9e-93b9-4ecf7f9fb07e.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,force,1

Originally built on the drained bed of Lake Texcoco, the suburb stretches out below in a patchwork of low-income housing with more than a million people crammed inside. Ciudad Neza, as it is commonly known, is now the most densely populated place in Mexico, part of the vast urban sprawl outside Mexico City.

Municipal officers insist they have changed, saying that their force has been purged, that corruption is being weeded out and replaced with a sense of civic duty.

""I think we've broken with the traditional way of thinking on local policing here,"" he says, in a rare show of pride. ""Unfortunately all too often in our country police chiefs and politicians have seen security not as a public service but as a business, as a way to make money.""

Image caption Jorge Amador started by purging the local force of corrupt officers He also improved wages and conditions for those who stayed. Some of his ideas were considered unorthodox, such as promoting literature and chess among his officers. But the intention, he says, was to combat ""inertia"", a term he uses often. ""We had to tackle that inertia, and dignify the role of a police officer once again."" Chess competitions and poetry readings among police officers is all well and good, but as many analysts point out, Mexico's problems run deep. Last year was the most violent year in the country's drug war with more than 23,000 people killed. With their key leaders either dead or arrested, several drug cartels splintered and battled each other for control. Boots on the ground For two consecutive administrations, the Mexican army has been deployed to try to bring peace to the streets, often playing the role of the police in many communities. Image copyright AFP Image caption Seeing soldiers on patrol in Mexico is not unusual Now the Mexican government wants to make that role permanent by law. The ""Interior Security Law"" is deeply controversial given the army's poor human rights record and prominent activists such as José Antonio Guevara have grave reservations. ""In carrying out these police duties over the past 12 years, the army has tortured thousands of people and has disappeared and summarily executed many thousands more,"" he argues. Specifically he referred to notorious incidents like the disappearance and subsequent murder of 43 student teachers in Ayotzinapa in 2014. The BBC requested an interview with the Mexican military and the ministry of interior but none was granted. At the local level, Mr Amador also does not think that the answer lies with the army. ""For us, security comes from bringing society closer together, from a closer relationship between the people and their institutions."" Different approach So he tried two other approaches in Neza instead. The first was to introduce new technology. Image caption Officers monitor the CCTV footage and deploy officers accordingly In a nerve centre at police headquarters, the officers can see every corner of Neza via a sophisticated system of CCTV cameras. A network of neighbourhood watch groups was also set up, which is directly in touch with the patrols via WhatsApp. There was also a return to some very basic community policing. For example, the municipality was divided up into smaller units comprised of just three or four blocks. The local officers now hold regular neighbourhood meetings in the evenings so people can air their grievances in the open. Image caption Residents gather outdoors to discuss problems in their neighbourhoods At one such meeting, it was clear that although car theft and violent crime are well below the national average, no-one was under the impression that Neza was now crime-free. Residents did say that had noticed some improvements though. ""It's not perfect but we've started to work together at last,"" Sandra said. ""At least when we ask the officers for help, they come out much quicker than before."" Her neighbour, Gerardo, pointed to a street alarm installed by the police. ""We report anything strange or suspicious that we see. And when that alarm goes off, I've seen neighbours come out half dressed and with a spade in their hands to defend our street from criminals!"" It is an election year in Mexico and security remains a key campaign issue. Many Mexicans believe their local police cannot be trusted. While in much of the country that may be true, Neza's unconventional police chief claims he has proven officers are not all bad apples, rotten to the core.

That this is how they are and how they'll always be.""",How one Mexican police chief tried to clean up the local force and establish order.,2018-03-09T02:03:48Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Patrolling Mexico's most densely populated suburb,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-43302244,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C1CA/production/_100301694_image1.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,force,1

The study of 46 countries and 800 occupations by the McKinsey Global Institute found that up to one-fifth of the global work force will be affected. It said one-third of the workforce in richer nations like Germany and the US may need to retrain for other jobs. Machine operators and food workers will be hit hardest, the report says. Poorer countries that have less money to invest in automation will not be affected as much, according to McKinsey. Image copyright Getty Images India, the authors write, will only have about 9% of jobs replaced by emerging technologies. The authors see tasks carried out by mortgage brokers, paralegals, accountants, and some back-office staff as especially vulnerable to automation. Jobs requiring human interaction such as doctors, lawyers, teachers and bartenders are seen by McKinsey as less prone to automation. Specialised lower-wage jobs, such as gardening, plumbing and care work, will also be less affected by automation, the study predicted. In developed countries, the need for a university education will grow, as jobs that require less education shrink. In the US alone, 39 to 73 million jobs may be eliminated by 2030, but about 20 million of those displaced workers may be able to easily transfer to other industries, according to the McKinsey report.

 Ukraine's military has been on high alert during the martial law which has been in place for 30 days
Martial law declared in parts of Ukraine has ended after 30 days, amid continuing tensions with Russia in the Kerch Strait.
The measure was in force in 10 regions along the Black Sea and near Ukraine's borders with Russia and Moldova.
It was declared after the capture of three Ukrainian naval vessels and 24 sailors by Russian forces in November.
Russia's foreign ministry said it hoped Western countries would dissuade Ukraine from any ""provocations"".
During the emergency, Ukrainian armed forces were put on combat readiness and reservists were called up.
Russian men aged 16 to 60 were barred from Ukraine under martial law, which ended at 12:00 GMT.
President Petro Poroshenko said earlier this month that he did not plan to extend martial law unless there was a large-scale attack from Russia.
Last month naval forces from the two countries clashed off Crimea, a disputed territory which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
Russia opened fire on and later captured three Ukrainian vessels, claiming they had illegally entered its waters.
The Ukrainian sailors were taken captive during the incident which Russia called an ""act of aggression"".
Ukraine said its ships had needed no Russian permission to cross the strait.
In a visit to the country last week, British Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said a Royal Navy ship had been sent there in support of Ukraine.","The law came into force last month, after a clash between Ukrainian and Russian forces off Crimea.",2018-12-26T12:47:20Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Martial laws comes to an end in Ukraine after 30 days,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46684602,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B47D/production/_104950264_gettyimages-1068948462-594x594.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,force,1

It was no mere prank, it was a classic small-unit military operation Gen. Wesley Clark, a classmate of Mr. Carhart, wrote in a foreword to Mr. Carharts book about the 1965 raid.

KENNETH P. VOGEL and KATIE ROGERS,"US Inc. celebrated the work of the Remembrance Project last week in a blog post, which praised Mr. Trump’s remarks last month about the toll of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants as “words many of us have waited decades to hear from the chief executive.” During Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, he helped raise tens of thousands of dollars for the Remembrance Project, which was started in Houston by the conservative activist Maria Espinoza, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2016. She did not respond to requests for comment about her group’s fund-raising or advocacy. After Mr. Trump’s election, the Remembrance Project opened a Washington office to support the work of the Voice office, and also formed a more politically oriented arm, the Remembrance Project Advocacy Incorporated, to spend money in elections and on lobbying. Aviac is also forming a political arm, registered under a section of the tax code — 501(c)(4) — that allows it to spend money to try to influence elections, without disclosing its donors. In the days after the news conference with Mr. Trump, Ms. Mendoza and several other family members personally endorsed Mr. Arpaio in the contested Republican primary for the Arizona Senate seat being vacated by Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican. “Joe would be a huge ally to the Trump administration and making America great,” said Ms. Mendoza, an Arizona resident who said Mr. Arpaio, a lightning rod in the immigration debate, reached out to her after her son’s death. Family members who have backed Mr. Trump also are supporting other candidates who have taken hard-line stances on immigration, including the California governor’s campaign of Travis Allen, a Republican state lawmaker who has called on the Trump administration to sue California to overturn its so-called sanctuary city law restricting the ability of state and local authorities to enforce federal immigration laws. If the families “can keep telling our stories,” it could help Mr. Trump and allied candidates who favor cracking down on undocumented immigration, said Laura Wilkerson, whose son was killed in 2010 by an undocumented immigrant.

Rhett Jones,"Following in the footsteps of the European Union and Australia, the government of India now wants to rewrite its laws to censor content and weaken encryption. If allowed to move forward, Indias new proposals would require many web platforms to remove illegal content within 24 hours and use broken automation techniques that will inevitably lead to censorship.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) uploaded a copy of its proposed amendments to the Information Technology Act to its website following a report from Indian Express on Monday. The brief, four-page document takes a sledgehammer to norms weve come to expect on platforms that traffic in user-generated content. The sweeping mandates would require platforms to prohibit users from uploading a wide range of content online and make it possible to trace offenders. Some of the banned content would be barred from most platforms anyway, such as uploading files that contain software viruses. But it would also mandate many other vague categories be proactively policed by tech giants including content that:
 is grossly harmful, harassing, blasphemous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, paedophilic, libellous, invasive of anothers privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically objectionable, disparaging, relating or encouraging money laundering or gambling, or otherwise unlawful in any manner whatever; 
[or]
 harm minors in any way;
[or]
 infringes any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights;
When it comes to issues involving security of the State or cyber security, platforms would be required to trace the origin of any activity deemed as suspicious and turn that information over to authorities within 72 hours of receiving a request. That kind of rule would mean that platforms, at the very least, would have to end any kind of features involving encryption that could obscure a persons identity or hide material that would be relevant to an investigation.
Major platforms like the Facebook-owned WhatsApp have become a problem for authorities in India as the viral spread of hoaxes from anonymous uploaders has led to violence and vigilante mobs. WhatsApp has 200 million users in India alone, but rather than work with individual platforms that have become an issue, it appears authorities patience has run out and they intend to set up their own version of Chinas Great Firewall.
Like the new copyright directive making its way through European Parliament, Indias regulators foolishly believe that tech giants and little guys alike can just automate their way out of the problem. Using filters like YouTubes multi-million dollar Content ID system leads to perfectly allowable content being flagged and algorithmic systems simply arent advanced enough to make sophisticated decisions using vague directives like stop anything that will harm minors in any way.
Some of the activity that India would like to see algorithms wipe off of the web gets even more abstract than identifying libellous speech. One line in the legislation bans user uploads of content that threatens the unity, integrity, defence, security or sovereignty of India. That could be virtually anything.
Any platform that has more than 5 million users located in India would also be required to appoint at least one full-time employee charged to work as a liaison between the government and the platform. This person would ensure that the company is doing everything it can to fall into compliance with the regulations.
The strict proposals regulating copyrights and trademarks would make it virtually impossible for any platform to risk hosting content that falls under parody or fair use. And overall, these regulations point to a future in which platforms and users are so nervous about letting a violation slip through the cracks, the only reasonable thing to do would be to impose heavy-handed self-censorship.
According to Indian Express, representatives from American tech companies like Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, Amazon, Yahoo, and Twitter met with Indian authorities last Friday to discuss the looming restrictions. These colossal organizations have billions of users and would likely find a way to comply with whatever rules are thrown at them in order to maintain a hold on one of the fastest-growing markets for web services in the world. Whether smaller players and newcomers could even theoretically follow these restrictive guidelines is an open question.
When a populace region proposes highly-disruptive regulations for the web, theres always the threat that companies working without borders will simply apply the changes to all of its users around the world in order to simplify operations. These new rules are so extreme and unrealistic that, if implemented, the more likely scenario for India is that it would break away into its own version of the web. Unfortunately, when the web fractures, it harms us all.

Tom McKay,"Hackers have discovered a bug that allows attackers to seize control of Googles Chromecast media streaming player, making it possible to force the device into playing any YouTube video they wantincluding videos that are custom-made, TechCrunch reported on Wednesday.
The bug exploits one well-known vulnerability (routers that have Universal Plug and Play [UPnP] enabled by default, exposing devices on a network to the broader web) as well as an apparent flaw in Chromecasts design that allows anyone able to access the device to hijack the media stream and display whatever they want without authentication, TechCrunch wrote. The site added the latter bug has been known for years after it was discovered by security researchers:
Bishop Fox, a security consultancy firm, first found the bug in 2014, not long after the Chromecast debuted. The researchers found that they could conduct a deauth attack that disconnects the Chromecast from the Wi-Fi network it was connected to, causing it to revert back to its out-of-the-box state, waiting for a device to tell it where to connect and what to stream. Thats when it can be hijacked and forced to stream whatever the hijacker wants. All of this can be done in an instant as they did with a touch of a button on a custom-built handheld remote.
Two years later, U.K. cybersecurity firm Pen Test Partners discovered that the Chromecast was still vulnerable to deauth attacks, making it easy to play content on a neighbors Chromecasts in just a few minutes.
According to TechCrunch, this vulnerability was discovered by the hacker known as Hacker Giraffe and used the technique to force thousands of Chromecasts to play a video warning that YOUR Chromecast/Smart TV is exposed to the public internet and is exposing sensitive information about you! Hacker Giraffe did provide a URL for afflicted users to learn more about the UPnP vulnerability, as well as quickly render it useless:
Disable UPnP on your router, and if youre port forwarding ports 8008/8443/8009 then STOP forwarding them.
Hacker Giraffe also directed people to subscribe to Felix PewDiePie Kjellberga YouTube star andperennialedgelord. (The individual behind the pseudonym also took credit for hijacking tens of thousands of printers earlier this year to spew a message reading in part, PewDiePie is in trouble and he needs your help to defeat T-Series!)
TechCrunch noted that the exploit could be used to pull off a complicated series of attacks, such as playing voice commands loud enough to be overheard by a smart speaker and thus mess with any connected accounts or devices.
As Gizmodo previously reported, UPnP has a lengthy track record of being compromised by hackers, often by exposing devices to the internet that should only be visible locally. [Content delivery network] Akamai reported this summer that UPnP was being used by hackers to conceal traffic in an organized and widespread abuse campaign. A recent attack using a UPnP vulnerability incorporated EternalBlue, a National Security Agency-developed exploit that leaked in 2017.
In a statement to TechCrunch, Google acknowledged it had received reports of the video popping up on Chromecasts, but claimed: This is not an issue with Chromecast specifically, but is rather the result of router settings that make smart devices, including Chromecast, publicly reachable.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Critics say the Air Force doesn’t pay enough attention to these matters because it is more worried about pilots and planes. With the Pentagon’s space-related activities dispersed among 60 agencies, some consolidation may be needed to eliminate inefficiency and focus on the true challenges in space. In fact, Congress had ordered the Pentagon to study that question; Mr. Trump pre-empted the results of that inquiry, which are due to be released next month. Rather than leaping to a vast new military bureaucracy, Mr. Trump might consider starting with a precise understanding of what is needed for improved space defense. Does the Pentagon need to do a better job of buying satellites and harmonizing the assets among the military services? Of building satellites that are more resilient? Is space truly the future of American power projection, even warfare, and does that mean we need new weapons and forces? Regardless, one major element clearly missing from Mr. Trump’s initiative is diplomacy that can make star wars less likely. China and Russia have proposed a legally binding treaty that would ban the use of force or weapons in space. But many experts consider such a pact unverifiable or even naïve, given how aggressively both countries are developing their own capabilities. A more plausible course would be for China and Russia to work with the United States and the European Union to establish norms for responsible behavior in space, including not to test antisatellite weapons. The Obama administration left the Europeans in charge of drafting such standards, but that effort, while helpful, came to naught. For any truly constructive result, the United States must lead, regardless of Mr. Trump’s disdain for multilateral negotiations. Other lower-level channels could provide the United States, Russia and China with a chance to discuss space cooperation. One is a United Nations group ; another is the Commerce Department, which has been asked to manage satellites and debris in space. Mr. Trump, and many experts, seem to assume that war in space is likely, if not inevitable. But despite their aggressive behavior, China and Russia also depend on access to space and should have an interest in avoiding conflict. Whatever happens to the Space Force proposal, Mr. Trump ought to be thinking bigger — about how the United States can help preserve outer space as a global commons, free of conflict and open to exploration by all space-faring nations.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","While the world was still hungover from the major climate conference in Poland last month, a game-changing climate treaty quietly went into effect. The Kigali Amendment entered into force as the calendar turned to 2019 and with it, the world began to put the clamps down on some of the most potent greenhouse gases on Earth. Now if only the U.S. would sign on.
Its taken years for the amendment to take shape and ratify, and it all stems from a big whoopsie in the 1980s. Then, scientists realized that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)chemicals commonly found in air conditioners, refrigerators, and other cooling technologieswere screwing up Earths ozone layer. The worlds governments acted quickly to phase them out, passing the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty thats considered to be among the most successful environmental treaties ever agreed to.
There was just one problem: The chemicals that replaced CFCs were insanely potent greenhouse gases. Pound for pound, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) warm the planet up to 11,700 times more than carbon dioxide. And ironically, as the planet heats up, the need for air conditioning will increase, resulting in more emissions tied to HFCs. To stave that off, countries proposed amending the Montreal Protocol to phase these chemicals out too. Doing so could cut global warming up to 0.4°C by 2100.
In 2016, the world agreed to the Kigali Amendment and since then, countries have been signing on. The amendment went into force last week with 65 countries ratifying it. Those ranks include industrial heavy hitters like European Union, Japan, Canada, and Australia as well as a host of developing nations, and the United Nations said it expects more to join the coming weeks. Notably absent are China and the U.S., the two biggest manufacturers and users of HFCs. China is expected to sign on.
The U.S. remains a wildcard, though, largely due to the White House and its seeming inability to get its act together. The Kigali is a rare environmental agreement that basically everyone else agrees is necessary.
Just last year, 13 Republican senators asked the White House to send it to the Senate for ratification. The refrigerant industry is for it and published a white paper showing it could result in an additional 33,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs and $12.5 billion in additional economic output to both replace HFCs and destroy the climate-warming chemicals. The industry has also suggested that China could get a leg up on the U.S. if it ratifies the treaty and begins manufacturing and distributing HFC-free refrigerators and air conditioners to the world.
It should go without saying that people who care about climate change are also pro-Kigali. But reactionary politics in the executive branch have mucked up what should be a pretty seamless process.
All the relevant constituencies want it done, David Doniger, the senior strategic director for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told Earther. The only one that doesnt is a bunch of ideologues at [libertarian think tank] the Competitive Enterprise Institute, [and] there are ideologues in the administration who dont like environmental regulations, who dont like climate regulations, and who dont like international agreements, environmental or otherwise.
Doniger also said the Trump administrations penchant for chaos and mismanagement has also probably mucked up the process. In a perfect world, the State Department, which negotiated the treaty under Obama, would convene an interagency working group and sign off on sending it to the Senate where ratification by a two-thirds majority vote seems pretty likely.
Yet despite the apparent inaction in the executive branch, former Trump energy advisor George David Banks told E&amp;E News that he feels bullish the White House will send the amendment to the Senate for ratification in the coming months. Even if the amendment doesnt make it there, Doninger said the U.S. still has some pathways forward to not fall totally behind.
As with most things in the Trump era, states could lead the way with California at the front of the pack. The state has already banned HFCs in new air conditioners and refrigerators and a handful of other states followed suit.
Congress could also step up its game, especially given the bipartisan agreement that phasing out HFCs is good for the planet and U.S. business interests. A bipartisan group of six senators, including both Republicans from refrigerant-manufacturing powerhouse Louisiana, introduced legislation to speed up the HFC transition last year. If the White House fails to act, Congress, including the climate-minded Democratic majority in the House, could if not ratify the amendment, at least pass legislation that mimics it.
Theres a lot going on even in the U.S. to make the phase down happen even while the Trump administration is in limbo, Doniger said.","While the world was still hungover from the major climate conference in Poland last month, a game-changing climate treaty quietly went into effect.

The most conventionally sketch-like segment is an extended commercial parody with Jon Hamm for “White Be Gone,” a topical cream for the treatment of “white thoughts.” That segment is also the one that most explicitly frames and addresses a white audience — Mr. Hamm, he’s told, was chosen to reach viewers who trust his “beautiful beige face.” It ends with a text exchange between Mr. Nance and the assistant director Annalise Lockhart, who suggests that “as ARTISTS we should be addressing whiteness less … and affirming Blackness more.” The first half-hour flows like this, fluid and self-interrogating. Mr. Nance appears in a short film — based, it says, on a real experience — about accidentally stepping into the wrong car after seeing a movie. It might be a silly mix-up, except that the terrified woman who sees him in her car is white, and calls the police. “Although it is likely that you, friend, have found this turn of events humorous up until this point,” the narrator says, “I assure you, it is not.”","Terence Nance, who in “Random Acts of Flyness” premiering Friday on HBO, is a deadpan presence onscreen and a curious, playful force offscreen.",2018-08-01T16:40:58Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Review: ‘Random Acts of Flyness’ Is a Striking Dream Vision of Race,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/arts/television/review-random-acts-of-flyness-terence-nance.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/03/arts/03flyness-1/03flyness-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1

Ms Ardern, who still breastfeeds her baby, is headed to the Pacific Islands Forum in Nauru for a day on Wednesday. The air force plane that dropped her deputy Winston Peters there on Monday is being sent back to New Zealand to pick her up. The round trip will cost taxpayers an estimated $52,873 (£41,173). ""I weighed this up. I even went to the extent of checking whether or not I could hitch a ride with Australia. We checked multiple options to try to find alternate ways for me to get there,"" she told the NZ Herald newspaper on Monday. ""The option was go for a short time or not go at all. If I didn't go, I imagine there would have been equal criticism... damned if I did and damned if I didn't."" She added that she was told the Air Force plane was unable to stay on Nauru in any case, and would have had to park at the Marshall Islands, which is an hour away. Ms Arden was not able to go to Nauru on Monday because of the length of time she would have had to spend away her from 11-week-old daughter. The baby is too young to get the vaccinations required to visit Nauru. On social media, reactions to the trip were mixed. ""[I'm] proud our leader is making the effort [to take] a day trip to get to Nauru,"" said one user on Twitter. But others questioned whether she needed to go at all.

Loren Grush,"After mastering its rocket landings on the Florida coast, SpaceX wants to try the same trick in California. The company recently filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission to land one of its Falcon 9 rockets on ground at Vandenberg Air Force Base in southern California, following a launch from the facility there. If that happens, it’ll be the first time that SpaceX has done a land landing on the West Coast. SpaceX has two options for landing its rockets following a launch. The company can touch down the vehicle on a floating drone ship in the ocean, or the rocket can return to its launch site and land on a concrete slab on the ground. Whichever option SpaceX picks depends on the type of launch that takes place and whether the rocket has enough fuel to perform the landing. For instance, returning back to land requires more fuel than a drone ship landing, so launches that eat up a lot of propellant during the ascent usually have to land in the ocean (if it all). it’ll be the first time that SpaceX has done a land landing on the West Coast So far, SpaceX has done slightly more drone ship landings than ground-based ones: 14 to 11. And most of these recoveries have occurred out of Cape Canaveral, Florida — the company’s most-used launch site — where rockets fly eastward over the Atlantic. In fact, all of the company’s ground landings have occurred in Florida (and they’ve all been successful, too). However, the company does do a handful of launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base, whenever it needs to fly southward to put satellites on a north-south orbit around Earth. SpaceX has pulled off four successful drone ship landings after launches from Vandenberg but has yet to send a rocket back to the California coast. Image: SpaceX SpaceX successfully landed two rocket boosters on land in Florida following the launch of its Falcon Heavy vehicle in February The infrastructure has been in place for a while to do land landings at Vandenberg, though. In 2015, SpaceX leased a site at the Air Force Base, where the company added a concrete landing pad for its rockets. However, the company has yet to receive clearance for a landing at the site. The Federal Aviation Administration did a study to figure out if landing Falcon 9s at Vandenberg would negatively affect the environment there and determined that this wouldn’t pose any big threats. Now it looks like SpaceX is finally going to make one of these California landings happen. For both its launches and landings, SpaceX must get a license from the FCC to use certain radio frequencies to communicate with the rocket. The FCC application that SpaceX filed requests a license for a launch from Vandenberg sometime between September 5th and March 5th. SpaceX will also need an additional license from the FAA for the landing too, to ensure that the rocket won’t hurt any observers or damage property. But getting the FCC license will be a big first step. Landing on land is a bit more convenient for SpaceX, since the company doesn’t have to haul the rocket back to shore as it does with drone ship landings. Plus, ground landings are pretty spectacular to watch, and the California coast will make for a great backdrop. A livestream of a Vandenberg landing would be a pretty one to see — as long as the fog doesn’t get in the way.","SpaceX recently filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission to land one of its Falcon 9 rockets on ground at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Southern California, following a launch from the facility there.

STANLEY REED and KEITH BRADSHER,"A few companies, notably Tesla, are trying to establish production lines in the West, using new technologies that Chinese factories cannot easily emulate. That is the route Enel is trying to follow in Sicily. Although heterojunction technology is not patented, Enel hopes that refinements it has made to the manufacturing process will give it a head start on rivals. “We have to manufacture modern, advanced, innovative products in their initial life cycle,” said Antonio Cammisecra, the chief executive of Enel Green Power. If Enel succeeds, it will give a crucial lift to a region that has lost as much as a quarter of its industrial capacity since the financial crisis, said Armando Castronuovo, an expert on the area at the University of Catania. The city’s economic backbone — agribusiness and tourism — has held up relatively well, but youth unemployment remains around 40 percent. Enel has drawn on the local university to find the advanced science graduates necessary to ensure it can continue to come up with cutting-edge technology. In all, it has preserved some 300 jobs at the plant and a nearby research center. Andrea Canino, 38, said science students like himself had benefited from close collaboration between the university and companies like Enel.","Europe was an early backer of solar power technology.

CHRISTOPHER MELE,"In a separate episode, agents of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations interviewed Mr. Kelley about allegations that he had assaulted his stepson.

He told the authorities that he had pushed his stepson down multiple times and shook him on at least two occasions. The investigation found that multiple organizations and individuals in the Air Force failed to follow policies during the investigations and after the court-martial, the report said.

DAVE PHILIPPS,"The Air Force has a base that can serve as a model: Andersen Air Force Base, in Typhoon Alley on the Pacific island of Guam. The base was destroyed by the ferocious winds of Typhoon Karen in 1962, which exceeded 175 miles an hour, and it has been hit by a succession of powerful storms since then. Andersens location makes it difficult to move the bases stealth bombers, drones and other aircraft quickly out of an approaching storms path, so the bases hangars have been hardened with steel and concrete to be exceptionally storm-resistant; some are designed to withstand winds of 195 m.p.h. Building that way is very pricey, even by Defense Department standards. A storm-rated hangar now under construction at Andersen is expected to cost $64 million. A larger hangar recently completed at Naval Air Station Jacksonville recently cost $123 million, and it is only rated to resist 120 m.p.h. winds. Such projects also take years to design, bid and erect. In the meantime, irreplaceable stealth fighters remain at risk. Within hours after Hurricane Michael had moved on from Tyndall, the Air Force had cleared a runway and begun flying in heavy equipment, temporary tent housing and a mobile hospital to support rebuilding. But the bases 33 airworthy F-22s have stayed away. They waited out the storm at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, and have now been temporarily reassigned to Langley Air Force Base outside Newport News, Va. Langley was chosen because other F-22s are based there, and equipment and maintenance crews could be shared. But the base, on a flood-prone coastal peninsula, is no safe haven. Most recently, Hurricane Isabel caused $146 million in damage at the base. At least 13 grounded stealth fighters rode out Isabel crammed into a single hangar that was rated to withstand a Category 2 hurricane. The hangar held, but it may not the next time. Langley should be worried, a lot of bases should, said John Conger, who oversaw environmental policy for the Defense Department during the Obama administration and now directs the Center for Climate and Security. There are plenty of other bases where the consequences of a direct hit are just huge.","The devastation of Tyndall Air Force Base, where 17 grounded F-22 stealth fighters were damaged in the storm, points to American air power’s vulnerability in major hurricanes.",2018-10-17T21:42:13Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Exposed by Michael: Climate Threat to Warplanes at Coastal Bases,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/us/tyndall-afb-damage-hurricane-michael.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/business/18TYNDALL/18TYNDALL-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,force,1
Rhett Allain,"There are so many real-world physics problems involved in running. Lots of physicists have been inspired, for instance, by the crazy-fast speeds of Usain Bolt. Just take a look at this paper, ""On the performance of Usain Bolt in the 100 m sprint"" ( European Journal of Physics ), in which the authors examine the motion of Usain in one of his sprints. But what if you want to look at more... unrealistic running? Or model running in situations you shouldn't test in real life—like running at the pool? In order to explore these situations, you'll need a physics model for running. Remember that science is all about building models, right? Let's say I want to build a model that shows the following real-world aspects of running: A runner hits the ground and then is off the ground during part of the motion (both feet off the ground). A runner accelerates but reaches some maximum speed. It's fairly easy to fit a mathematical equation to a runner's motion. But what if you want to go a little bit deeper than just an equation (so we can change stuff)? One common idea is to assume there is a frictional force pushing the human forward and a velocity-dependent drag force pushing against the motion. As the speed of the human increases, so does the drag force, until you get to a ""terminal velocity"" where the two forces are balanced. I don't like this approach (even though you can get it to fit the data fairly well). If air resistance were really the thing that limits running speed, then it would seem like you could go super fast on a stationary treadmill (you can't). Also, a tail wind would provide a huge boost (it only gives a tiny boost). Finally, you could run at crazy-fast speeds in a vacuum (who knows about this one). Instead of the air-resistance model of running, I'm going to go with the following assumptions: A human is basically a point mass that is just plain projectile motion in between contact points with the ground. During this time off the ground, the human has to switch leg positions (move back leg forward), and this motion takes a minimum amount of time. During contact with the ground, a human can only exert some maximum force. Note, this is from an excellent paper, ""The biological limits to running speed are imposed from the ground up"" ( Journal of Applied Physiology ). Also from the same paper, the contact time with the ground depends on the running speed. The faster you run, the shorter the ground-contact time. So why would this model work? Let me start with a diagram. Suppose a human is running and in contact with the ground (not during the stride part of the run). Let's step through the important parts of this bouncing-ball model of a running human. Suppose the ball starts above the ground and is moving just a little bit (or just falling down—it doesn't matter). When it hits the ground, there has to be an upward force to change the ball's momentum so it doesn't keep moving down, but instead starts to move up and get off the ground again. I know the required vertical velocity of this ball after it impacts the ground because the ball has to stay in the air for a set amount of time (the stride time) so that its non-existent feet can switch from front to back. That might seem all fine and dandy, but here is where the model comes into play. There is some maximum force that the floor can push up on this human-ball, and there is some maximum contact time over which the force can act on the ball. Let me remind you of the momentum principle. As the running speed increases, the contact time decreases, meaning you need a greater upward force to get the ball in the air. Since there is some maximum contact force, more upward force means less forward force to increase the speed. At some point, the contact time gets small enough that all of the force has to be in the vertical direction to get enough air time. There will no longer be a forward-pushing force, and the horizontal velocity becomes constant. OK, now I'm going to build this model. However, I need a few pieces of data. These are either rough guesses or based on the article in the Journal of Applied Physiology linked above. The maximum force on the ball is between 3 and 4 times the weight of the person. The stride time is about 0.3 seconds (the time the feet are in the air). The time of contact with the ground depends on the speed. I have an equation based on contact time vs. speed from the above article (using real data ). To get this to work the way I want, I have to add one more aspect to my model. For the horizontal force, only part of this (only 20 percent—random choice) goes to increasing the speed of the human-ball. I will assume the rest of this horizontal force is used to accelerate the legs so they can move back and forth in a motion that most people call ""running."" You have waited long enough; here is the code with my bouncing human-ball running model. Just click Play to run it. Feel free to edit the code in whatever way you like. Yes, it's not the prettiest code, but it seems to work. I added some comments so you can figure out how it works. Also, notice the parts where you can change the parameters (like stride time or maximum force) to see what happens. Play around with it—it's fun! The animation isn't that useful, so how about a graph? Here is a plot of the horizontal speed as a function of time. Here is the code with graph stuff in case you need it. That graph makes me happy. Why? First, it shows the human-ball reaching some maximum running speed. With the parameters I'm using, the running speed is around 9.5 m/s (21 mph). Just for comparison, the human record speed is 27.8 mph. Second, you can notice that the speed doesn't increase continuously. How can you increase your speed while you are in the air in between strides? You can't. You can clearly see that speed increases only during the contact times. So, what's next? Well, I made this model because I want to use it for something else. In the meantime, you can use it for whatever you like.

ROBERT PEAR,"At hearings before two Senate committees to review his qualifications, Mr. Azar presented himself as a problem-solving pragmatist rather than an ideologue. At no time did he deviate much from the policies set by Mr. Trump. “The Affordable Care Act has failed millions of Americans who have lost the plans they liked and the doctors they liked,” Mr. Azar declared. Mr. Azar, 50, graduated from Yale Law School and was a law clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court. Democrats dismissed the idea that Mr. Azar might be a moderating influence in the administration. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Senate health committee, said Wednesday: “I’m alarmed that Mr. Azar believes a woman’s employer should be able to decide, based on ideology, whether or not her birth control should be covered. I’m alarmed by his extreme and out-of-touch views on Roe v. Wade,” the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, explained why he had decided to oppose Mr. Azar: “The Trump administration’s determination to destroy the Affordable Care Act through executive action has destabilized our health care system and threatened coverage for millions. I fear Alex Azar could make things even worse.” But Republicans were broadly supportive. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, who has been in the Senate for 41 years, told Mr. Azar, “You’re one of the best public servants that I’ve seen in the whole time that I’ve been here.” Mr. Azar said repeatedly in recent weeks that “drug prices are too high,” but he placed most of the responsibility on “a system” that encourages price increases. “Everyone shares blame,” he told the Senate health committe e in November. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, was frustrated. “Mr. Azar says he agrees that prices are too high, but he does not seem ready or willing to do much about it,” she said. From 2012 to early 2017, Mr. Azar was the president of Lilly USA, a unit of Eli Lilly and Company, the global drug maker based in Indiana. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said Mr. Azar told the panel that “he had never — not even one time — signed off on a decrease in the price of a medicine.” “On Mr. Azar’s watch,” Mr. Wyden said, “the price of Forteo, a Lilly drug used to treat osteoporosis, more than doubled,” as did the prices for Humalog, used to treat diabetes, and Strattera, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Mr. Hatch said Mr. Azar’s experience as a drug company executive, far from creating a conflict of interest, was an asset. And he said he hoped Mr. Azar would undo many of the policies put in place because of “poor decisions made throughout the eight years of the Obama administration.” Mr. Azar will replace Tom Price, who resigned as health secretary in September, in the face of multiple federal inquiries into his use of private and government planes for travel. Republicans tried unsuccessfully last year to roll back the expansion of Medicaid authorized by the Affordable Care Act. But the Trump administration is determined to make major changes in the program. Mr. Azar told Congress that states should be allowed to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries. “One of the best ways to improve the long-term health of low-income Americans is to empower them with skills and employment, for those who are able to work,” Mr. Azar said.

MATT STEVENS and CHRISTOPHER MELE,"As emotional and disruptive as the false alert was, it was not the most dangerous episode of its kind because it did not reach the military’s chain of command or decision-makers in government, he said. Here is a look at a few cases when it did: Photo The command post for North American Aerospace Defense Command operations in 1982. In 1960, Norad was sent to its maximum alert level because of a “moonrise over Norway.” Oct. 5, 1960: The moon tricks a radar A false alarm came when an early warning radar in Greenland reported to North American Air Defense Command headquarters that it had detected dozens of inbound Soviet missiles. The report thrust Norad to its maximum alert level, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, but officials later determined that the radar had been fooled by the “moonrise over Norway.” Nov. 9, 1979: A ‘war game’ tape causes six minutes of worry Computers at Norad indicated that the United States was under attack by missiles launched by a Soviet submarine. Ten jet interceptors from three bases in the United States and Canada were scrambled, and missile bases went on “low‐level alert,” The New York Times reported. When satellite data had not confirmed an attack after six minutes, officials decided that no immediate action was necessary, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists and The Times. Investigations later discovered that a “war game” tape had been loaded into the Norad computer as part of a test. A technician mistakenly inserted it into the computer. “The tape simulated a missile attack on North America, and by mechanical error, that information was transmitted into the highly sensitive early warning system, which read it as a ‘live launch’ and thus initiated a sequence of events to determine whether the United States was actually under attack,” The Times reported. June 3, 1980: 2,200 missiles that never came Less than a year later, computers once again issued a warning about a nuclear attack. Bomber and tanker crews were ordered to their stations, the National Emergency Airborne Command Post taxied into position and the Federal Aviation Administration prepared to order every airborne commercial airliner to land, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists and The New Yorker. President Jimmy Carter’s national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, got a call informing him that 2,200 missiles were heading toward the United States. Then Mr. Brzezinski got another call: It had been a false alarm. An investigation later found that a defective computer chip — costing 46 cents — was to blame. Sept. 26, 1983: Similar problems on the other side Stanislav Petrov, a 44-year-old lieutenant colonel in the Soviet Air Defense Forces, was the duty officer at a secret command center outside Moscow when the alarms went off. Computers warned that five missiles had been launched from an American base. “For 15 seconds, we were in a state of shock,” he later recalled in an interview with The Washington Post. Colonel Petrov, according to his obituary in The Times, was a pivotal cog in the decision-making chain. His superiors at the warning-system headquarters reported to the general staff of the military, which would consult with the Soviet leader, Yuri V. Andropov, on whether to launch a retaliatory attack. Electronic maps and screens were flashing as he tried to absorb streams of information. His training and intuition told him a first strike by the United States would come in an overwhelming onslaught, not “only five missiles,” he told The Post. After five nerve-racking minutes, he decided the reports were probably a false alarm. And they were. The satellite had mistaken the sun’s reflection off the tops of clouds for a missile launch.

WILLIAM NEUMAN,"Photo Mayor Bill de Blasio, in a shift, expressed openness on Friday to a congestion pricing plan proposed by a task force appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Credit Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday voiced a cautious openness to a new proposal to charge drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan — a change from his previously firm opposition to such an idea. “This plan certainly shows improvement over previous plans we’ve seen,” Mr. de Blasio said during his regular radio appearance on WNYC, though he stressed that he had not seen all the details of the proposal, which is known as congestion pricing and was prepared by a task force appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The mayor called it “definitely a step in the right direction,” adding that “I see some good elements in this new plan.” Such language from Mr. de Blasio was markedly different from previous statements, in which the mayor has said that he was opposed to earlier congestion pricing proposals because he did not believe they were fair to drivers living outside Manhattan and to people of lesser means. The issue has also become an element of the long-running feud between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo. The governor has taken to championing congestion pricing as a way to provide financing for the city’s beleaguered transit system, while the mayor believes money for public transit can be raised by imposing a new tax on the wealthy. Mr. de Blasio said on Friday that to earn his support, a congestion pricing plan would need to put the money it raised into a “lock box” so that it could be used only to finance subways and buses in New York City. Asked what he saw as improvements in the new plan, Mr. de Blasio said, “We see improvement on the question of fairness to Brooklyn and Queens by taking the bridges out of the equation.” Continue reading the main story","Mayor Bill de Blasio, in a shift, expressed openness on Friday to a congestion pricing plan proposed by a task force appointed by Gov.

MARK LANDLER and ERIC SCHMITT,"In an interview on Thursday with The New York Times, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the furor over Mr. Khashoggis death had mushroomed into one of the biggest foreign policy crises of his presidency. This one has caught the imagination of the world, unfortunately, Mr. Trump said. Its not a positive. Not a positive. The president also said on Thursday that it was still a little bit early in the process to draw definitive conclusions about who ordered the killing. But he expressed no doubt that the truth would come out soon. Were working with the intelligence from numerous countries, he said, adding, This is the best intelligence we could have. On Wednesday, The Times reported that American intelligence officials were increasingly convinced that Prince Mohammed is culpable in Mr. Khashoggis death, and that they were preparing an appraisal for the White House. Saudi Arabia tried to project the idea of a housecleaning, announcing that Saud al-Qahtani, a close aide to the crown prince; Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, the deputy director of Saudi intelligence; and other high-ranking intelligence officials had been dismissed. For Mr. Trump, who is on a three-day swing in the West before the midterm elections, the Khashoggi affair has become a distraction during a period in which he had hoped to campaign for Republican congressional candidates on a message of economic growth and the recent confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Allan Atulinda Image caption Zarake Maria Goretti says the paramilitary force will give her job security Uganda's government is a creating a new security force to combat soaring levels of crime, but critics fear it could become a law unto itself, writes the BBC's Patience Atuhaire from the capital Kampala. Zarake Maria Goretti sits on the grass after giving her blood samples for her medical check-up. The 22-year-old is one of thousands who turned up at an open-air ground, usually used for trade fairs in Kampala, to apply to join the new civilian militia, known as Local Defence Units (LDUs). About 6,000 LDUs are currently being trained to help the security forces curb crime following a wave of high-profile murders. Critics have memories of the last time a civilian militia existed. Some of its members were accused of abusing their positions, and becoming criminals themselves. But Ms Goretti is anxious to pass her medical tests, and join the militia. Although she has qualifications in hotel management, she wants to get on the government payroll. ""I would have a more secure job there,"" Ms Goretti told the BBC. Image copyright Allan Atulinda Image caption Successful recruits will operate in their neighbourhoods Thirty-year-old Abue George William, on the other hand, said he had always aspired to protect the nation. ""I will make sure that every family is safe, there are no thieves in the neighbourhood, and everyone is free to move - even at 1am,"" he said. LDUs are expected to patrol neighbourhoods, pass on intelligence to police, and give them back-up when they are dealing with incidents of crime. Recruits are being promised a monthly salary of 200,000 Uganda shillings ($50; £40). There is an enormous queue - typical of any recruitment drive in a country where there is a shortage of jobs. 'Museveni's reputation on the line' Soldiers are spearheading the recruitment process, weeding out those who do not have the right paperwork. The hopefuls are put through a physical test, including a run of 4km (2.5 miles). Security Minister Elly Tumwiine told the BBC the LDUs would ""be accountable to the army and work alongside the police"". ""It is a joint operation,"" he added. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some say the Ugandan police are overstretched Recruits will undergo four months of training, and will be deployed, with weapons, in Kampala and nearby areas. This follows a directive in September from President Yoweri Museveni to make urban areas safer. Support for the president during his three-decade rule is partly based on his reputation as a guarantor of security, ending the political turbulence and instability that stretched from the late 1960s to when he came to power in 1986. But since 2014, Kampala has witnessed a worrying level of insecurity. Spate of killings At least five Muslim leaders were mysteriously gunned down between December 2014 and October 2017 in Kampala and surrounding areas. Other unresolved high-profile murders include that of state prosecutor Joan Kagezi, former police spokesman Andrew Felix Kaweesi, politician Ibrahim Abiriga, and most recently, Mohammad Kirumira, a police officer who was outspoken about corruption in the police force. In 2017, there was also an upsurge in the kidnapping and murder of women. About 20 women were killed in a space of four months in and around Kampala, causing fear and shock. Machete-wielding gangs also wreaked havoc in some city neighbourhoods. A former security chief, who asked to remain anonymous, put the insecurity down to the economic downturn. ""Young people are educated but have no jobs. Some have had to turn radical for their own survival. ""Criminal gangs like Kifeesi who operate in the city are a result of this alienation,"" he said. Kifesi is said to have its headquarters in the Katwe slum of Kampala, and its members are notorious for breaking into people's cars when they are stuck in traffic jams and hitting them with iron bars before robbing them. The president has expressed concern about the failure to hunt down criminals. ""It is clear that the intelligence has been weak in the cases where the murders have been committed, like in the cases of [the prosecutor] Kagezi and the others. This weak area is being strengthened,"" Mr Museveni said as he announced the creation of the LDUs. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The abduction and killing of women caused outrage The police force is about 45,000-strong, but, the security minister says, it is overstretched. And the military is not in a position to help because it is involved in peacekeeping missions in countries like Somalia, the army's Col Bonny Bamwiseki told the BBC at a recruitment centre. ""We can't be deployed to secure urban neighbourhoods. ""These young people will secure their villages because they know them best,"" he added. More from Patience Atuhaire Gen Tumwiine said the LDUs would play an intelligence role and reinforce police efforts to tackle crime. ""We haven't developed technological means and we believe that the human eye is the most reliable as of now. ""It worked for us in the past and we believe in it,"" he said. 'Guns for hire' Some human rights activists have reservations about their formation, saying the government had formed LDUs more than 10 years ago, but they became discredited. Its members became notorious for hiring out their guns to criminals, or turning themselves into gunmen for hire. ""They were not well motivated, not well screened and they became part of the problem rather than the solution,"" said the executive director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative, Livingstone Sewanyana. ""I see it as a misguided approach to the whole question of law enforcement. There is no legal framework for the LDUs,"" he added. Image copyright Allan Atulinda Image caption Thousands applied in the hope of getting a job The former security chief, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed similar reservations. ""We have local councils and leaders at the village level, parish intelligence officers, district intelligence officers. This structure runs all the way to regional level. What happened to this very elaborate internal security organisation structure?"" ""How come men on motorbikes can commit crimes so close to the centre of power and get away with it? Where do they melt to? It would mean the public has lost trust in the system and they do not share useful information."" But Gen Tumwiine is confident the decision to form the LDUs will pay off.

DAVE PHILIPPS,"Its aftermath was both devastating and remarkable, with helicopter footage of the base Thursday morning showing hangars that had easily survived past storms now riddled with gaping holes. At least three twin-engine propeller planes owned by a contractor and used for training were buried in debris from the wreckage of the largest hangar, which also housed at least five QF-16 jets retired fighters that have been stripped down and turned into drones and used as target practice. Those, too, were entombed beneath what was left of the building. [ Click here for photos from Hurricane Michael. ] In a Facebook post late Thursday, base leaders said many of the buildings were a complete loss. The marina, its structures and docks were also destroyed. Power lines and trees blocked nearly every road, and utilities and electricity had not been turned back on. The destruction of an air force base can only be matched in scope by the pounding that Hurricane Andrew gave Homestead Air Force Base, just south of Miami, in 1992. That Category 5 storm, with winds estimated at 150 m.p.h., smashed hangars and left battered fighter jets and mammoth cargo planes in pieces on the runway. Nearly all of the surviving planes and personnel were reassigned to other bases. Two years later, it reopened as a smaller, Air Force Reserve base. The Air Force was unable to say Thursday when Tyndall might resume operations. Other Air Force and Navy bases in the area, which were spared the brunt of the storm, reopened in a limited capacity Thursday. Tyndall, where about 3,600 airmen are stationed, sits on 29,000 acres that include undeveloped woods and beaches, as well as stores, restaurants, schools, a bowling alley and quiet, tree-lined streets with hundreds of homes for both active-duty and retired military. Video footage captured the ruin there, too: The high-powered storm skinned roofs, shattered windows, and tossed cars and trailers like toys, transforming the normally pristine base into a trash heap. Multistory barracks buildings stood open to the sky. The Air Force said Thursday that recovery teams conducted an initial assessment of portions of base housing and found widespread roof damage to nearly every home. At this point, Tyndall residents and evacuated personnel should remain at their safe location, said Col. Brian Laidlaw, 325th Fighter Wing commander. We are actively developing plans to reunite families and plan to provide safe passage back to base housing.","Hurricane Michael tore directly into the base.

ROBERT PEAR,"This is about empowering patients, Ms. Verma said.
It has not worked out that way, at least so far. Martin Gaynor, a professor of economics and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, described list prices as somewhat fictitious.
If this is an initial step leading to real transparency with actionable, usable information, that would be fantastic, Mr. Gaynor said.
But in its current form, he added, the price information is not very useful and could even be misleading because a hospital with high list prices could be the cheaper alternative for some consumers, depending on their insurance.
For patients to know up front how much their care will cost, thats incredibly valuable, said Brenda L. Reetz, the chief executive of Greene County General Hospital in rural southwest Indiana. Weve posted our prices, as required. But I really dont think the information is what the consumer is actually wanting to see.
Spending on hospital care last year totaled $1.1 trillion, or nearly one-third of all health spending, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. So even small improvements in the market could yield big savings.
The Trump administration adopted the new requirement as part of its agenda to promote transparency in health care, in the belief that health markets would work better if consumers had more information. In another example, federal officials want to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list price of prescription drugs in television advertisements.
Providers and insurers have to become more transparent about their pricing, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said last year. There is no more powerful force than an informed consumer.","The Trump administration’s order was intended to force transparency and price competition, but with opaque and inconsistent data, the rollout is turning into a fiasco.",2019-01-13T22:04:28Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Hospitals Must Now Post Prices.

MARGARET KRAMER and JENNIFER HARLAN,"On Feb. 14, 2018, a former student slaughtered 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. 
The next day, David Hogg, a student who survived the attack, expressed his frustration at the pattern of political inaction that seems to follow mass shootings in the United States. He was not surprised that there had been another school shooting, he said, and that fact alone says so much about the current state that our country is in, and how much has to be done.
We need to do something, he said. In the course of the next year, students would change the way the nation handles mass shootings, spurring new gun legislation and school safety measures, and holding to account the adults they felt had failed them.

CHRISTINE HAUSER,"A strong winter storm will spread across much of Colorado and parts of the central United States on Wednesday, sending hurricane-force winds and heavy snow across the region, meteorologists said.

JESSE McKINLEY,"Mr. Hoylmans bill is one of at least three proposed in recent years that seek the release of Mr. Trumps state tax returns, including legislation that he co-sponsored with Assemblyman David Buchwald, a Westchester County Democrat.
That earlier bill, known as the New York Truth Act, would require the state Department of Taxation and Finance to release five years of income tax returns from eight officials (if they earn income in New York): the president; vice president; New Yorks two United States senators; and four statewide elected officials, including the governor and the state attorney general.
Most of those officials currently release or give access to their tax returns, but Mr. Buchwald said the Truth Act bill is the most tangible, best opportunity to produce the presidents tax return.
Obviously, when someone fills one of these higher offices, they have to meet a higher standard, Mr. Buchwald said, adding that such state returns would reveal worldwide income as well as potential conflicts of interest.
I think its a good general principal for us to be promoting, Mr. Buchwald said. The bill, first introduced in 2017, now has enough co-sponsors to pass the Assembly and Senate.
A third bill, also sponsored by Mr. Hoylman, would require candidates for president and vice president to reveal their past tax returns in order to appear on primary and general election ballots. Similar efforts are also being considered in more than a dozen other states, including California and New Jersey.
Daniel Hemel, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago who teaches tax law, said that the New York state Legislature could authorize the release of Mr. Trumps state returns, but that knotty legal issues are at play as well, particularly because of federal laws protecting tax information. For instance, if New York were to release federal return information that is contained within the state tax return, Mr. Hemel said, the Internal Revenue Service could conceivably cease cooperation with the state.","State Senator Brad Hoylman, a Manhattan Democrat, is sponsoring a bill that could force the release of President Trump’s state tax returns.",2019-04-08T07:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","To Get Trump’s Tax Returns, N.Y.

Sam Byford,"While tectonic shifts in the tech industry have seen CES and its ilk decrease in relevance over the past decade, some product categories have been less affected by the rise of all-encompassing platforms pushed by software titans. For these forms of consumer electronics, it remains entirely appropriate to be trotted out on a Las Vegas stage with incremental updates every year. To put it another way, it’s never not going to be fun to go to CES and look at a bunch of awesome screens. TV manufacturers were out in force this year, as they are every year. LG added Google Assistant and Alexa to its industry-leading OLED sets, and unveiled an 88-inch 8K OLED prototype. Sony added Dolby Vision support to its own OLED and LED TVs, while Panasonic got behind rival dynamic standard HDR10+. Samsung was actually quiet this year in terms of introducing new models, but continued to insist that QLED is a thing. And TCL’s excellent Roku-powered P-Series got a further improved successor in the 6 Series, which may well be the best value 4K TV of 2018. But while CES is always going to be a major show for conventional TVs, we’re starting to see more interesting developments where TV technologies are moving to other types of displays — and back the other way. Most notably, CES 2018 marked the first serious rollout of HDR capability to personal computers. Preceded by VESA’s recent launch of a spec for PC monitors called DisplayHDR, manufacturers including LG, Dell, and Viewsonic all launched compatible models. LG had the most compelling conventional monitor of the show by far, with its “5K ultrawide” 34WK95U that makes use of Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, 600-nit HDR, and the same nano-IPS tech used in the company’s LED TV range. There’s never been a better time to buy rectangles of pixels The most impressive implementation of PC HDR at the show, however, came from an unlikely source: Nvidia. The GPU maker unveiled a new hardware spec called Big Format Gaming Displays — BFGD — designed to slot into ultimate PC gaming setups. Manufacturers like Asus, HP, and HP are all producing their own spin on the BFGD, using the same 65-inch 4K 120Hz HDR-capable panel from AUO. The difference between this and a 4K TV is where Nvidia comes in — BFGDs support the company’s G-Sync technology, which syncs the refresh rate of the display directly to the GPU’s output, meaning you get a smooth experience without any stuttering or tearing no matter what framerate your machine is capable of pushing. G-Sync is a revelation on PC monitors, so it’s great to see it come to larger screen sizes. It’s worth noting, however, that Nvidia may not be alone here. G-Sync only works with Nvidia GPUs, and the company collects fees on every compatible monitor produced; AMD, meanwhile, has its own version called FreeSync that doesn’t cost manufacturers anything to implement. And AMD is backing another open variant called Game Mode VRR, which has actually been included as part of the new HDMI 2.1 spec — so we should soon see several conventional TVs ship with variable refresh rate support. That means that if you have a compatible AMD GPU, or even AMD-powered console like the Xbox One X, you’ll have more options for a similar experience outside Nvidia’s closed ecosystem. Nvidia remains the GPU market leader for good reason, however, so if you built your sick gaming rig around a GTX 1080 Ti you might not have much of a choice. With TV features like HDR making their way to PC monitors and PC features like VRR making their way to TVs, the lines are blurrier than ever. And even TV companies like Samsung are creating products that attempt to leverage expertise in both categories — take the 55-inch Flip touchscreen whiteboard, for example, which is basically a 4K TV converted for office use. Microsoft and Google have iterated on the idea, but it’s notable to see a TV maker get into the game. There’s never been a better time to buy rectangles of pixels If we’re heading into a future where your PC monitor can be your TV without compromise, then, hopefully we’ll be able to concentrate on things like image quality and form factor without worrying about obscure HDR standards and HDMI compatibility. If we can get to that point by the time some of the more forward-looking display technology on show at CES 2018 is practical, it’s going to be a good world. LG Display, for example, showed off a completely outrageous 65-inch OLED TV that can be rolled down into a little box and change aspect ratio on the fly. It’s just a prototype, but it’s a practical and tangible one. Samsung, meanwhile, thinks the future is modular — its showpiece this year was called The Wall, a 146-inch screen assembled out of little MicroLED building blocks. Samsung believes the technology will surpass OLED, and apparently actually plans to release it in some undoubtedly expensive form this year. Maybe neither idea will take off, and that’s okay. It’s what CES is all about. But what really matters is that once you wade through the spec sheets and format wars, there’s never been a better time to buy rectangles of pixels — and that reality was driven home time and time again at this year’s show.","TV manufacturers were out in force this year, as they are every year.

MARK LANDLER,"Yet the tit-for-tat between the speaker and the president suggested something else: that despite his inability to change the politics or institutions of Washington, Mr. Trump has managed to change its culture. The capital now plays by his freewheeling rules.
He does generally force people to play down to his level, said Michael DAntonio, a biographer of Mr. Trump. Its impossible to deal with him in any other way. It takes almost a Zen master to resist being provoked by him.
There is no doubt that Trump-like behavior is proliferating. When the House freshmen, all Democrats, arrived at the office of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, on Wednesday to deliver a letter demanding that he reopen the government, they quickly discovered he was not there.
One of Mr. McConnells deputies, Don Stewart, accepted the letter and promised to give it to his boss.

I knew that HBO was looking for a family drama. So I sat down to write one. But I didn’t want it to be just another family drama about a family dealing with what families deal with. Certainly a multiethnic family made it more interesting for me as a writer. It also just seemed like it would give us more interesting stories than sibling rivalry or somebody gets a mammogram. You know, your usual family TV show tropes. [Laughs] The sort of mystical-mysterious element just sort of happened. Were your story lines affected by the political moment? I was working with the writers when Donald Trump was elected president, and we started to see the show as a kind of prism through which we could look at all these different characters’ multiethnic, multigenerational viewpoints living in Trump’s America. How do you deal with that? How do you make sense of that? Why Portland? Portland has this reputation for being so incredibly progressive — and it is. However, it also has a pretty sketchy history in terms of racism. For a place that’s very progressive, it’s still predominantly Caucasian. So there’s an interesting dichotomy there, because it’s a very progressive town and one of the greatest places to live. At the same time, it isn’t really what it aspires to be.

We have people who are adoptive parents. Growing up in my white privilege, I have no reason to know these things. So it’s not so much research on my part, it’s having these great writers that I work with who bring their own experiences to the table. Like Greg, you recently turned 60. Were you as unhappy about the milestone as he appears to be? Well it’s hard to age, to get older, to realize “Wow, my body isn’t working like it used to.” It’s hard to go, “How many years do I have left?” I’m not sure I have any empirical data to back this up, but I think it’s harder for men than women. I think women are more in touch with their emotions, with the cycle of living. Whereas men are conditioned to believe that we’re invincible and will remain that way forever — and we’re stupid enough to believe that. [Laughs] I feel like I’ve had about five midlife crises. I think the first one was when I was about 35. As someone who struggled with depression and anxiety [my] whole life, I feel like you got to pull yourself out of there, you got to find a way. I wanted Greg to start off at the bottom. I wanted to see him work his way out of that. You also feature a Muslim family where the parents are comfortable with their child being transgender. Is there a story behind this? Photo Alexander Skarsgard and Kristin Bauer van Straten in a 2013 episode of the HBO series “True Blood.” Credit John P. Johnson/HBO Peter said, “If this is going to be a show about America, we need a Muslim family to be a part of this tapestry.” People are so terrified of, don’t understand, project all kinds of weird stuff onto Muslim characters — especially the way they’ve been depicted in the mainstream media. They’re never complex or nuanced. I did some research and, of course, there are trans Muslim kids. We’re so conditioned to think of Muslim families as so conservative that there’s no room for any kind of out-of-the-box expression for one’s identity — and that’s just not the case. Your favorite childhood movie — “My Six Loves” — is about a family of adopted children. Are you paying tribute? It’s not my favorite movie. It’s the first movie I ever went to see. Debbie Reynolds plays an actress who ends up adopting six adorable hillbilly children. And she realizes: “Oh, I don’t want to be an actress. I want to be a mother. That’s what’s really fulfilling.” [Laughs] One of the running gags is that one of the kids is mesmerized by flushing the toilet, and he keeps doing it. I just remember that was the first time I sat in a big darkened theater, looked up on a screen and saw this story unfold. I haven’t seen it since I was 5 or 6. I’m sure it would be a big letdown from what exists in my memory. In 2000, you won an Oscar for writing “American Beauty.” I read that you dressed it in a pink fur coat. Because? [Laughs] My identity, a lot of it, is based in feeling like the outsider. So when I won an Oscar, it was terrifying. When I brought it home, I put it on a shelf, and it looked so pretentious. So I bought a pink fur Barbie coat and put it on [the Oscar] and somehow it made it O.K. for me to have it in my house. But then I got over that and took it off. Now I have a shelf in my office where all the statuaries are. None of them are dressed.

ADAM GOLDMAN,"Photo Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, last month in Washington. Credit Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images WASHINGTON — Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, defended his work force in an email on Monday after President Trump said on Twitter that the agency’s standing was the “worst in History” and its reputation was in “Tatters.” In a message to the F.B.I.’s 35,000 agents and support staff that was provided to The New York Times, Mr. Wray said that he was “inspired by example after example of professionalism and dedication to justice demonstrated around the bureau. It is truly an honor to represent you.” He did not mention Mr. Trump by name. But Mr. Wray’s remarks came one day after the president’s latest bashing of the country’s premier law enforcement agency. Mr. Trump said that Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., was treated unfairly by agents. Mr. Trump compared Mr. Flynn’s case to the federal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information, in which she was not charged after being interviewed by the F.B.I. The president’s most recent comments angered F.B.I. personnel, who have been caught in a political maelstrom since the president fired James B. Comey, the bureau’s former director, in May. Last year, Mr. Comey opened the highly charged investigation into whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates colluded with the Russian government. Mr. Trump has called the inquiry a “witch hunt.” An F.B.I. spokesman declined to comment on Monday. The F.B.I. had hoped that in dismissing Mr. Comey and choosing Mr. Wray to replace him, the president would stop targeting the bureau. But that was not the case.

JOHN ISMAY,"Arguments against the use of cluster munitions are twofold. Because of their wide dispersal pattern, submunitions may strike civilians who are not even close to intended targets. Additionally, many types of submunitions fail to properly detonate at a higher rate than other weapons, resulting in bomblet “duds” that can explode even years later and kill civilians. Military bomb disposal technicians have estimated that cluster munitions have a dud rate as high as about 20 percent. The 2008 policy, signed by the defense secretary at the time, Robert M. Gates, gave the Pentagon 10 years to develop and use cluster munitions that “do not result in more than 1 percent unexploded ordnance” by 2018. Mr. Gates declined to comment on Thursday. At the time he signed the memo, the American military had only one weapon it claimed met that goal, the BLU-108 Sensor Fuzed Weapon, which the Air Force used widely during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. But that 1 percent claim was quietly walked back in 2016 after photographs in Yemen showed large numbers of dud Sensor Fuzed Weapons that were dropped by Saudi Arabian warplanes. The United States provided those cluster bombs to the Saudis. Shortly afterward, the bomb’s manufacturer, Textron Systems, announced that it would cease production of Sensor Fuzed Weapons. Textron’s former chief executive officer, Ellen M. Lord, now serves as the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. However, Textron has no plans to restart manufacturing cluster munitions, said a spokesman for the company, David Silvestre. The last known use of cluster munitions by the United States military was a December 2009 strike in Yemen, when Navy warships fired multiple Tomahawk cruise missiles carrying bomblets. The target was “a confirmed A.Q.A.P. terrorist training camp,” according to a former senior American military officer familiar with the decision to launch that attack, using a term for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The military believed there were no civilians in the area, said the former officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the sensitive operation. The American military’s account has been publicly challenged. Amnesty International reported that the 2009 attack killed 41 people, including 14 women and 21 children. The group also reported finding dud submunitions at the site. It is unclear whether the new change will cease the destruction of the existing cluster munition stockpile, as required by the 2008 policy. Older cluster artillery shells, for example, containing submunitions with a high dud rate, for years have been sent to an Army ammunition plant in McAlester, Okla., to be demilitarized. A spokesman at the plant said he was unaware of the policy change and did not know whether demilitarization operations were still active there. Thomas C. Crosson, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the new policy maintained the goal of procuring only cluster weapons with a dud rate of 1 percent or less, but that the deputy defense secretary could waive those limits “under extreme wartime circumstances.” Army data from earlier this year, obtained by The New York Times, said that the American arsenal contained more than 2.2 million cluster munitions in the United States and 1.5 million abroad — most of them in South Korea.

SCOTT CACCIOLA,"Video GANGNEUNG, South Korea — Ever since the International Olympic Committee added curling to its official list of winter sports in time for the 1998 Games, the sport has been a quadrennial source of curiosity — and something of an addictive force — for spectators across the globe. The athletes — yes, they’re athletes and don’t you dare suggest otherwise — deliver polished granite orbs across a long sheet of ice. They use special brooms and wear special shoes and have their own special language, barking commands like “hurry hard!” Canadians, in particular, love this stuff. Here in Pyeongchang, curling will clutter the calendar for 18 full days — longer than any other sport at the Games. Mixed doubles actually starts Thursday, the day before the opening ceremony. There will be no shortage of hurrying hard this month. So as we dive back into the madness, a quick primer might be in order. Without getting too technical, how do you play? Let’s start with the men’s and women’s team events. There are four players on each team, who rotate jobs. But for each throw, one player delivers the rock — the aforementioned granite stone, which weighs between 38 and 42 pounds — two teammates sweep and the fourth person sets the target. The target is at the other end of the sheet. Known as the house, it’s a series of concentric circles that forms a sort of bull’s-eye. So, how do you score? Each match takes place over 10 ends, which are kind of like innings in baseball. A total of 16 rocks — eight per team — are thrown during each end, and the teams alternate shots. One of the quirks of curling is that only one team can score in each end, and that point goes to the team that puts a rock closest to the button once all 16 of them have been thrown. If that team has two rocks closest to the button, they get two points — and so on. If a team takes three or four points in a single end, that’s a huge score and often amounts to an insurmountable lead. Also, it might be worth familiarizing yourself with the term “hammer.” The team with the hammer gets to throw the last rock, which is a huge tactical advantage. The hammer for the first end is awarded to the team that puts two rocks closest to the button in a pre-game shootout. (Officials measure the combined distance.) As the match wears on, the hammer goes to the team that did not score in the previous end.

THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN,"Iran claims it is setting up bases in Syria to protect it from Israel, but Israel has no designs on Syria; it actually prefers the devil it knows there — Assad — over chaos. And it has not intervened in the civil war there except to prevent the expansion of Iran’s military infrastructure there or to retaliate for rebel or Syrian shells that fell on Israel’s territory. I understand Iran’s security concerns in the Gulf; it faces a number of hostile, pro-American Sunni Arab powers trying to contain its influence and undermine its Islamic regime. From Iran’s perspective, these are a threat. But what is Iran doing in Syria? Tehran’s attempt to build a network of bases and missile factories in Syria — now that it has helped Assad largely crush the uprising against him — appears to be an ego-power play by Iran’s Quds Force leader Suleimani to extend Iran’s grip on key parts of the Sunni Arab world and advance his power struggle with President Hassan Rouhani. Suleimani’s Quds Force now more or less controls — through proxies — four Arab capitals: Damascus, Beirut, Baghdad and Sana. Iran has actually become the biggest “occupying power” in the Arab world today. But Suleimani may be overplaying his hand, especially if he finds himself in a direct confrontation with Israel in Syria, far from Iran, without air cover. After all, even before this, many average Iranians were publicly asking what in the world is Iran doing spending billions of dollars — which were supposed to go to Iranians as a result of the lifting of sanctions from the Iran nuclear deal — fighting wars in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. That is surely one reason Iran has not retaliated — yet. Suleimani has to think twice about starting a full-scale, direct war with Israel, because of another big story many people have not noticed: Iran’s currency is collapsing back home. Consider this April 12 story on CNBC.com: The Iranian rial “has plummeted to a record low amid growing economic and political uncertainty, causing a rush to the banks as Iranians desperately try to acquire U.S. dollars with exchanges forced to shut their doors to prevent long and chaotic lines.” The rial has lost one-third of its value just this year, the story noted. Moreover, Israeli military officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin and Suleimani are no longer natural allies. Putin wants and needs a stable Syria where his puppet Bashar Assad can be in control and Russia can maintain a forward naval and air presence and look like a superpower again — on the cheap. Iran’s President Rouhani probably also prefers a stable Syria, where Assad has consolidated his power and that is not a drain on the Iranian budget. But Suleimani and the Quds Force seem to aspire to greater dominance of the Arab world and putting more pressure on Israel.",Iran’s elite Quds Force is trying to use Syria as a base to pressure Israel.

Nick Statt,"The rollout of 5G in the US may be hobbled and scattershot, thanks to silly marketing gimmicks and a largely meaningful race to the be first, but the next-gen wireless speeds the standard promises are already arriving in full force across the Atlantic Ocean — for a herd of cows in England. According to Reuters, Cisco is testing infrastructure for the eventual global rollout of 5G that could be used by various industries that are not traditionally in the tech bubble but are still dependent on increasingly sophisticated hardware and software. That includes farming. In this case, Cisco is trying out 5G in three rural locations by giving farmers access to 5G-connected cow collars and health-monitoring ear tags that can transmit biometric data and help workers monitor the herd from afar. One of the three sites participating in the test is the government-funded Agricultural Engineering Precision Innovation Centre, or Agri-EPI Centre, in Shepton Mallet, a small town in southwest England. The farm has nearly one-third of its 180-cow herd fitted with the 5G collars and tags, Reuters reports. “We can connect every cow.” It makes a whole lot of sense when you think about it: farms are large and spread-out spaces, and cows are often shuffled between grazing grounds and areas of the farm where they can be more easily milked and checked on. With the 5G collars, Cisco says farmers can keep tabs on the animals at all times of the day without having to physically trek out to observe the cows up close. Additionally, the 5G smart collars help automate the milking process by wirelessly communicating with a robotic milking system that lets the cow approach the station at its own leisure, pass through the gates after an ID check, and hook up to the robot all with little to no human intervention. The future is wonderful and weird, and farmers have access to it before you and I because without them, we all starve. “We can connect every cow, we can connect every animal on this farm,” Cisco’s Nick Chrissos told Reuters, in what may be the strangest boast a Cisco executive has ever uttered in public. “That’s what 5G can do for farming — really unleash the power that we have within this farm, everywhere around the UK and everywhere around the world.”","The rollout of 5G in the US may be hobbled and scattershot, thanks to silly marketing gimmicks and a largely meaningful race to the be first, but the next-gen wireless speeds the standard promises are already arriving in full force across the Atlantic Ocean —…",2019-04-12T16:54:46Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","These cows already have 5G, and you don’t",https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307939/5g-cows-cisco-test-england-farm-smart-collars-ear-tag-farming-tech,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UE-ZqVOFgOjugEDoWeUt6tpDPuk=/0x524:4500x2880/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028017/958690348.jpg.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,force,1
BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For centuries, children have spent hours on special joined handwriting lessons - but do we need them? The US state of Illinois has passed a law requiring school students to learn joined-up handwriting, or ""cursive"", overriding the governor's veto. It is no longer a requirement in US schools, and some countries have dropped the skill from the curriculum or made it optional. Why, then, do some - like the UK - still insist on it in a digital age? Shouldn't children learn to type effectively instead? Goodbye writing While victorious Illinois senators claimed the skill was essential, the reality is that many adults no longer write much by hand. A 2012 survey of 2,000 adults by UK mailing firm Docmail found that on average, it had been 41 days since respondents wrote - and that two-thirds of us only write short notes like shopping lists. The clear, blocky ""print"" style that children are first taught is enough for that purpose. And for an increasing number of young children, that's where their training ends. US states such as Indiana have dropped joined-up writing entirely ; Finland phased out handwriting lessons ; and Indian schools are reportedly abandoning it. The usual argument is that the time investment could be used to teach modern skills such as typing or coding instead. But is there a benefit to hours spent painstakingly copying the joined alphabet? Developing style Teaching children to write by hand seems to have some advantages that typing on a keyboard does not. A 2005 paper by researchers at Aix-Marseille University compared typing and writing in children aged three to five to see if there was a difference later in recognising the letters. Their evidence suggested that writing by hand helped the older ones recall the letters better. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In 2013, North Carolina also enforced handwriting lessons A study in 2012 went further, putting five-year-old children who had yet to learn to read and write through similar tests - writing, typing, or tracing letters. Then, they were shown images of the same letters and shapes while an MRI machine scanned their brains. In the children who wrote - but not in those who typed - an area of the brain used in reading activated. Researchers concluded that it's possible - but not proven - that the physical act of writing might help children learn to read. ""The motor control is important,"" said Dr Karin James, one of the authors. "" Doing things is important in setting up brain systems that are important for cognitive development."" Later research from Dr James also suggests that learning joined letters by watching someone else write them - rather than doing it for yourself - does not provide the same benefit. Slow and steady One argument for the importance joined-up writing is that it's usually faster and more fluid for note-taking than printing letters. But a skilled typist can copy words down even faster - so after early childhood, is there any benefit? The evidence so far suggests that writing by hand retains its benefits for memorisation long beyond early childhood development. A 2014 study from UCLA, titled The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard, found exactly that. It studied laptop use among university students, and said it could be ""impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing"". Media caption WATCH: Could a computer copy your handwriting? It tested students by asking them to take notes from a lecture, using either a laptop or a pen and paper, and then tested their recall on both facts and deeper conceptual questions. Essentially, the study found that students taking long-form notes on pen and paper tended to process the information on a deeper level. ""When somebody's telling you something and you're writing it down by hand... you paraphrase it... you somehow have ownership of it and put it in your own words,"" Dr James said of the study. Typed notes, though faster, tended to be closer to lecture transcripts than personal notes. Cursive culture There are also cultural issues. Proponents of cursive argue that hundreds of years of manuscripts could not be read by a generation who never learned it. We also tend to view ""a fine hand"" favourably for its elegance, and careful calligraphy remains popular on elaborate documents and wedding invitations. Image copyright Hulton Archive Image caption Styles change - this October 1598 address reads: ""To my loving good friend and countryman, Mr Wm Shakespeare, deliver these"" In the same way, bad handwriting leads to poorer test scores, according to a study by the Carnegie Foundation. The same thoughts and ideas expressed ""in a less legible version of a paper"" tended to be scored more harshly. Meanwhile for students with dyslexia, typing can help significantly increase exam grades, according to the British Dyslexia Association.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"An experiment using intense laser pulses has allowed scientists to watch plants produce oxygen from water part of photosynthesis in real time, according to a groundbreaking new paper. Photosynthesis fixes carbon dioxide into sugars and creates oxygen out of water in the presence of sunlightit turns the sun into usable energy. Scientists hope to understand this reaction and incorporate it into solar energy technology. This new study using one of the worlds brightest lasers to present a view of the intermediate steps of the reactiona movie of the reaction occurring. Water splitting is one of the most fundamentally important chemical reactions on the planet, Uwe Bergmann, principle investigator at the Stanford PULSE Institute and a scientist from the papers interdisciplinary, international list of authors, told Gizmodo. Plants carry out the chemical reactions of photosynthesis using two systems of proteins, photosystems I and II, held in a part of their cells called the chloroplasts. Photosystem II was the interest of this study. It uses light energy to split water molecules, creating electrons and protons used at other parts of the process. This system also produces the oxygen we breathe. The water splitting occurs in a part of photosystem II called the oxygen-evolving complex, where theres a cluster of manganese, calcium, and oxygen atoms. Scientist Bessel Kok proposed in 1970 that this region goes through a series of steps to split water. The researchers imaged each of these steps by controlling them with light pulses, according to the paper published today in Nature. It represents an enormous feat of precision measurement. Light controls this water-splitting reaction within photosystem II, study author Junko Yano, from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, explained to Gizmodo. Studying this oxygen-evolving complex by shining light on it lets us capture various moments during the reaction using a sequence of visible flash lights, and then take pictures with x-rays. Imaging the oxygen-splitting process in action required first creating crystals out of photosystem II complexesthis alone was a major feat. The scientists then had to hit all of the proteins with a pulse of light so that they proceeded to each of the next steps of the water-splitting cycle at just the right time. Then, they took the picture by diffracting an incredibly short x-ray laser pulse off of the crystal. This destroys the crystallized proteins, but not before capturing the identities of the molecules and how theyre bonded to one another. Its really a tour-de-force in terms of producing the crystals, giving them the appropriate flashes, and ending up with these intermediate states, Robert Blankenship, a professor in biochemistry at Washington University in Saint Louis, told Gizmodo. This is, I think, one of the most important milestones on this journey to understanding how oxygen is actually made in these systems. The story isnt over yet. The paper elucidates how photosystem II splits water, but it leaves out how the molecular oxygen we breath (also called O 2 ) forms. Yano told Gizmodo that it was exceedingly difficult to get beamtime at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratorys x-ray laser, one of the worlds brightest. And theres more to the story than just understanding plants. If you understand how photosynthesis happens, it will be easier to make viable solar energy panels or something that can sufficiently convert solar energy to energy we can use, study author Ruchira Chatterjee, post doctoral fellow at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, told Gizmodo. Photosynthesis is a marvela chemical reaction that evolved early in the history of our planet, and upon which much of Earths life relies. Weve just inched another step closer to fully understanding it, and perhaps harnessing it for our own technologies. We need to figure out creating energy without creating carbon dioxide, Bergmann told Gizmodo. You can talk about all kinds of things, but in my opinion, and in many experts opinions, the Sun will be the answer.
