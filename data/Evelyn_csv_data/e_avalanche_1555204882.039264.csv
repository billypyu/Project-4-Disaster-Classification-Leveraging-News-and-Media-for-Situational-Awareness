Aimée Lutkin,"Some of you are probably just digging yourselves out from the email avalanche of Thanksgiving weekend. In just a few weeks, we’ll fall into the final holiday wormhole of the year, and have to make our way back through piles of unread missives on January 2. Here are a few tips to make the return to work and email slightly less painful. Fast Company spoke with author Alexandra Samuel, who literally wrote the book on the subject ( Work Smarter, Rule Your Email ), and Dmitri Leonov, vice president of email management system Sanebox. Their tips on how to manage your emails while on vacation without actually being constantly logged onto your computer are extremely helpful. Because you’re definitely busy and important, but not so busy and important you shouldn’t take time to relax and drink eggnog with the kids. Lie! Samuel suggests a diplomatic auto-responder that suggests people with urgent email needs write you again on the date of your return. Leonev suggests you tell them you’re getting back to work several days after you actually will: “That will give you time to get back to the office and actually get stuff done,” he says. “Plus, everyone will be super impressed when you get back to them on the ‘day of your return.’ It’s all about setting up expectations.” And if you’re very bold, you can theoretically delete everything you got over the break—anyone with something important to say will email again. Help Yourself And Don’t Send Emails Both Leonev and Samuel suggested that people should resist the urge to attack their to-do list before a vacation and just. Stop. Sending. Emails. Give yourself at least a 72-hour pre-vacay break from unnecessary convos. You won’t want to deal with the response anyway, especially if it’s an email to your boss, and they suddenly want to chat. Filter, Filter, Filter You can filter out things like newsletters and other daily spam with most email systems, and also prioritize certain messages from specific people (like the clients who are paying for your vacation). It might even be worthwhile to make a “vacation email account” that receives forwards from the important folk in your main box, so you can just see at a glance if they’re contacting you. Which brings us to this point: Um, Check Your Email Leonev says that spending five minutes every other day to just delete bulk messages from Sephora, or whatever, will save you lots of time later. He also advocates for just responding quickly to anything that can be resolved quickly. A forward, a “yes” or “no” answer, anything that ends the correspondence—but doesn’t extend it. “When you reply, think a step ahead to answer any other questions that might trigger another email,” says Leonov. Good luck with inbox zero, and don’t forget to look up from your phone when the ball drops!","Some of you are probably just digging yourselves out from the email avalanche of Thanksgiving weekend.

STEVEN KURUTZ,"Mr. Flanagan backdates his period of constant mourning to 2013, when Lou Reed died at 71. “That was a kick in the head,” he said. “It seems like the kicks in the head have continued since then.” This year’s bruisings include James Cotton, J. Geils, Chris Cornell, Gregg Allman, Chester Bennington, Glen Campbell, Walter Becker, Gord Downie and David Cassidy, though that’s by no means comprehensive and the year isn’t quite over. Several performers have appeared vital and present, only to drop dead. In September, Mr. Petty completed a triumphant summer tour celebrating the 40th anniversary of his group, the Heartbreakers. A week later, he suffered cardiac arrest at home and was medically unresponsive, then gone. When Mr. Flanagan taped a tribute for CBS Sunday Morning, he was visibly stunned as he began, “I cannot believe I am doing a eulogy for Tom Petty.” “Everyone’s reaction was: ‘I saw him last week! I saw him last month!’” said Mr. Flanagan, who knew the singer personally for 30 years. “The other thing is, he was an MTV-era star, so he seemed to be of the younger generation. And he never went away, he was always doing something new. This guy we counted on to be around.” That Mr. Petty wouldn’t be around forever seems an obvious point. Sixty-six-year-old men with poor lifestyle habits die of heart attacks every day. They just aren’t the guy who sang “I Won’t Back Down.” But at this point, as a middle-aged rock fan, with hip-hop and R&amp;B having surpassed the form in popularity, you’d have to be dead yourself not to consider the fading of the culture, and along with it, your own youth. Fifty years after the Summer of Love, we’ve entered the Winter of Ulcerative Colitis. “As these canonical figures go, there’s a sense of ‘There goes my childhood, my youth, my early years,’” Mr. Flanagan said. “It’s hard. It takes a bit out of you.” We rock fans have our grief rituals: Watching old concert and interview clips on YouTube. Going to Apple iTunes to download an artist’s back catalog. Holding an on-air wake so callers can share stories of how the music touched their life, like the ones Mr. Flanagan co-hosted on the Tom Petty Radio channel on SiriusXM, in the hours and days following the singer’s death. The mourning is formalized at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in Cleveland. “Given the frequency in the last few years, we have a protocol,” Greg Harris, the museum’s president and chief executive, said. When an inductee passes, Mr. Harris said, “we play their music all day in the museum and we lower the flags on the plaza,” as though saluting a fallen head of state. The museum also pulls from its archive related memorabilia to put on exhibit. “Right now, we have an amazing Rickenbacker guitar that belonged to Tom Petty,” Mr. Harris said. And what about the musicians themselves, the ones who lived it and are still out there truckin’, if with balding tires? Last year, drummer Carl Palmer lost his former bandmates Keith Emerson (self-inflicted gunshot wound) and Greg Lake (cancer) within months of each other, leaving him the only surviving member of the 70s progressive rock trio Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. There is no E.L.P., without the E and L. “Suddenly, the whole pack of cards is gone,” Mr. Palmer said. “How do you get over that? You don’t actually get over that.” For Mr. Palmer, who also lost his good friend and former Asia bandmate, John Wetton, to cancer earlier this year, all the funerals in such a short span have strengthened his resolve to keep playing music (he is healthy at 67 and still touring ), and to not go out as a rock ’n’ roll cliché. “The first thing I thought was, ‘I don’t want to die of a heart attack in a hotel room,’” he said. “It’s sad. Especially if it’s not a five-star hotel.” When he recently finished putting together a new E.L.P. box set, and the finality of the group’s life was made clear, Mr. Palmer realized something that rock fans might tell themselves to ease the bummer. “All you’ve got is memories of the music,” he said. “Which is all you ever had anyway.” If that doesn’t provide solace, consider another truism of rock ’n’ roll and life: Keith Richards will outlive everyone.

 Alpine rescue teams on foot work through the deep snow near Courmayeur
British and French skiers are among three people found dead after an avalanche near the Italian resort of Courmayeur, Italian media report.
Two people each from the UK and France were reported missing on Sunday afternoon, when the risk of avalanches in the area was high.
Searchers found three bodies and are looking for the fourth skier.
In all, eight people, including a Belgian snowboarder, died in Italy as a result of weekend avalanches.
Italian newspaper La Repubblica said the alarm had been raised by friends of the two British skiers around noon when the pair failed to arrive at a meeting point. They were on the last day of their holiday, the newspaper said.
Search operations were also hampered by the continuing risk of avalanches, preventing search teams from going on foot, and search efforts had to temporarily suspended on Sunday.
Two other avalanche victims had been found dead earlier on Sunday in the same region - the Aosta Valley.
Several Italian residents were among the eight killed at the weekend, local media report.
The national alpine rescue group has encouraged snowsport enthusiasts to check what level of avalanche warning is in effect every day, and to ""carry out all activities with the greatest caution"".","A weekend of avalanches leaves eight people dead, including British, French and Belgian citizens.",2019-02-04T10:59:28Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Italy avalanche kills British and French skiers,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47116059,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/36C1/production/_105471041_hi052091174.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,avalanche,1

AUSTIN RAMZY,"Photo Mount Kusatsu-Shirane, top left, which erupted on Tuesday, is about 100 miles northwest of Tokyo. Credit Kyodo, via Reuters A volcano erupted Tuesday in Japan, killing one soldier who was training nearby and injuring more than a dozen people, including several at a ski resort, officials said. The eruption of Mount Kusatsu-Shirane triggered avalanches and launched debris that smashed a gondola and hit people on ski slopes. Seven members of Japan’s military who were training in the area were caught in one of the avalanches and had to be taken to a hospital, Japan’s Ministry of Defense said. One of the soldiers was later confirmed to have died, officials said. Ten people were hit by rocks at the ski resort, injuring five seriously, the public broadcaster NHK reported, citing the police. Another five were hurt by debris that smashed the windows of a gondola. The volcano is about 100 miles northwest of Tokyo in Gunma Prefecture. Photos showed ash covering a large area of the mountainside below the three large craters at its peak. After the eruption at about 10 a.m. Tuesday, officials raised the alert level, restricting access to the area. “Seeing cinders falling in the videos, it is certain that an explosive eruption occurred,” Toshitsugu Fujii, a volcanologist and professor emeritus of the University of Tokyo, told NHK. He said the volcano had erupted 3,000 years ago, but no activity had been detected recently. “We need to be warned, as there may be another eruption,” he said. Separately, the Mayon volcano in the Philippines continued to billow ash on Tuesday, one day after officials raised the alert level to four, the second highest level. That means the volcano is in a period of “intense unrest” and could erupt hazardously at any time.

David Murphy,"A new tool recently released by a research team at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory offers a novel way to fight online harassment: getting your trusted friends to help keep unwanted emails out of your account. Even if you aren’t a minor Internet celebrity, an opinionated social media star with a big following, or a super-popular streamer, it’s possible that you’ve suffered harassment online —possibly even a lot of harassment—if people who don’t like you or your opinions dox your personal email address. While great inbox filters can help you stop a small stream of terrible emails, you might need more firepower if you’re facing an avalanche each day (and still want to receive emails from unknown, but legitimate people). The service from the MIT team, Squadbox, works pretty simply. Instead of giving out your real email address in a public website, forum, or video stream, you use your Squadbox email account instead. That, or if you’re already been publishing your real email address, you can set up filters to forward potentially problematic emails to a “squad” of helpers you’ve set up. As Squadbox’s creators describe : “When an email arrives for moderation, a moderator makes an assessment, adding annotations and rationale where needed. The message is then handled in a manner according to the owner’s preference, such as having the email delivered with a special tag, placed in a particular folder, or discarded.” When I set up a test account, I found it pretty easy to build a “squad” by inviting friends and giving them a helpful description of the kind of content I do (and do not want) to see in my email inbox. Squadbox can automatically reject any emails with attachments, useful if jerks are sending you unwanted pictures or files, and it’s easy to add your Gmail contacts to Squadbox’s whitelist just to make sure that authentic emails are never accidentally blocked by the ‘box—or your moderation time. I didn’t see a way to set up a direct @Squadbox email address, but that’s probably a feature that will roll out at a later date—that, or you have to contact Squadbox directly to have them set one up for you. As Squadbox notes, the entire system is still in beta testing, so you can likely expect to see more features and improvements as the team refines the (free) service. Nevertheless, it’s an interesting concept—assuming you have friends who are willing to help go to bat against the Internet’s very worst. That, or you don’t mind paying some buddies to help you fight off an avalanche of crappy emails on a daily basis.",A new tool recently released by a research team at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory offers a novel way to fight online harassment: getting your trusted friends to help keep unwanted emails out of your account.

Jonathan Shieber,"More posts by this contributor The world of consumer goods is changing. Consumer tastes are becoming more and more fragmented and big incumbents continue to lose market share to upstart brands. It’s often difficult for these incumbents to figure out how to respond. CPG is full of smart people but many of the biggest brands have seen their sales stagnate or decline over the past several years. Consumer companies can increase profit and deliver shareholder value by either growing in revenue or cutting costs, but the strategies these companies have taken to try to turn the tide just aren’t working. When they innovate, they only make incremental changes to products (like reducing the fat of a potato chip), instead of offering consumers new products that they actually want. Or they spend billions on advertising to convince consumers that they should buy already existing products. If they can’t increase revenue, they’ll cut spending by stripping out valuable business teams or merging with other consumer companies to slash costs (à la Kraft-Heinz ). These strategies do not position Big CPG for long term success, I’d like to suggest a few that might. Before I dig in here, I want to say upfront that I don’t have all the answers (or even most of them). I’m the CEO of a startup with 65 employees — not a massive corporation with 30,000 employees. The insights I hope to share are gathered from over a decade working in consumer investing and helping consumer companies grow, but they’re ultimately insights from the outside looking in. Replace “Kellogg’s” with the name of PepsiCo, Estee Lauder, Nestlé, Kraft -Heinz or countless other big brands and the observations should still resonate. This isn’t about just one company, it’s about the dynamics that exist for virtually all CPG incumbents. What I would do differently On day one as CEO of Kellogg’s, I would take a hard look in the mirror and I would ask myself which Kellogg’s brands are still relevant and can grow. I recently had a conversation with a former VP of a major CPG company and he said that Big CPG is guilty of thinking that everything can be relevant if they bring the right news to it. I agree. As CEO, I would acknowledge up front that we have certain brands and products that are cash cows now-but are slowly dying. An uncomfortable but proactive step would be to sell the legacy cash cows that are dying and invest the cash windfall into innovation. This week I was in another discussion with a 20 year veteran from a Fortune 100 consumer company who said “I think in 10 years our company will no longer exist. It will be broken up.” Conversations about selling legacy brands will make a lot of consumer executives squirm, but they are conversations that need to happen. Cutting the dying cash cows is the hardest but probably most important step in righting the ship. After deciding which of our legacy brands to divest, my next step would be to publicly announce that we will shift focus away from cutting costs and towards investing in a culture of innovation to actually grow the business. This will likely cause our stock price to go down in the short term, but in the medium to long term this will help our company tremendously. Simply put, we can’t survive by cutting costs forever. We need to grow. Our culture of innovation will be built and promoted in a variety of ways. What follows isn’t a sequential list but rather initiatives that should be pursued in parallel: 1) Research and Development. We will signal to Wall Street that we are going to focus on growth and innovation, not cost-cutting. We’re going to go through a rehaul of the R&amp;D process and pipeline and we will dare to dream bigger. In 2017, Kellogg’s spent $148 million (1.1% of net revenue) on R&amp;D. This may at first sound like a lot, but for comparison, Google spent $16.6 billion (15% of net revenue) on R&amp;D during the same time period. The dichotomy between tech and consumer spending on this front is highlighted in the chart below. R&amp;D Spending as a Percentage of Annual Net Revenue Source: Company 10-Ks for 2017 It’s no wonder that one of these companies has been making Frosted Flakes the same way for over 60 years (with goofy TV commercials for most of that time ) while the other started as a search engine and now builds phones, maps, and self-driving cars. Imagine how comical it would be for a tech company to sell the same product for 5 years, let alone 50. R&amp;D is not just about coming up with a new flavor or lowering the fat content of an existing product. As one big CPG veteran told me recently – “consumers don’t care about ‘whiter whites’” anymore”. It involves building an adaptive infrastructure that truly listens to what consumers want and then relays that information to development teams in a way that allows them to be agile and effective. We need to have an R&amp;D team that is focused on the category and consumer, not the product. Instead of Pepsi thinking about a lower fat potato chip, they need to be rethinking the snack category as a whole. Why is it insane to imagine AB InBev developing a beer that doesn’t cause hangovers, but it isn’t crazy to imagine Elon Musk sending people to Mars? Why is it laughable for Clorox to invest a billion dollars into developing a non-toxic, safe substitute for bleach, but it’s normal to imagine investing $15 billion into Uber - a company that is trying to replace all taxis in the world and rethink transportation? Those comments are meant to push public CPG CEOs, not to degrade SpaceX or Uber. Good R&amp;D also involves keeping your ear to the ground for great ideas that may already be out there. There could be a toothpaste in India that would revolutionize the way we think about toothpaste in America, but we’ll never know if we aren’t listening. For an example of what can happen without this R&amp;D infrastructure, look no further than the pharmaceutical industry where Big Pharma companies are now having to pay to outsource innovation because they can’t foster it in house. CPG is becoming Big Pharma. 2) Incubation. In addition to investing in and partnering with great consumer companies, we will provide space and expertise in house to help them grow. Kellogg’s recently partnered with Conagra Brands and the City of Chicago to invest in a $34 million food incubator that is expected to support around 75 companies, 80% of which will be in the snack category. This is definitely a step in the right direction, but I’d want us to go bigger and take the operation in house. I’d like to incubate 100+ companies per year from a wide variety of categories and become the Y Combinator for consumer. This will be a win-win. We get to help great consumer companies grow and these companies get to leverage our expertise and infrastructure. 3) Venture capital. Too many CPG companies only invest in brands once those brands are 5+ years old and end up paying a huge sum as a result. I would change our mandate to invest in companies that will be interesting 10 years out – not just companies that we think are going to contribute immediately to our revenue or existing product strategy. We need to take the long view here and data plays a big role. Kellogg’s will not identify innovation just by sending a dozen people to Expo West. We need a non-commoditized data and technology solution that can help us identify breakout brands early by looking at their growth potential- not their Expo sales booth. Kellogg’s is actually ahead of most CPGs when it comes to venture in that they have a venture arm of $100 million. But this is still too small. I would start by having our venture arm manage assets of $500 million (less than 4% of net revenue but still 50x the AuM of many CPG corporate venture arms) and tell them that they are going to invest in 200-300 companies, focusing on early stage companies with less than $10 million in revenue over the next 2-4 years. If that sounds insane, look at Google’s GV for some inspiration. They build a diverse portfolio to foster innovation from many and sometimes unexpected angles. If tech VCs can have a portfolio of hundreds of companies, so can we. A venture arm in consumer is nothing new. Many large CPG companies have launched venture arms, but most of these consumer VCs only plan to invest around $5-$10 million across 3 to 4 companies. Then the CEO loses his or her nerve, succumbs to the pressure of short-term cost cutting, and bails on the strategy. We will dare to take the long view. Beyond just capital, I would create a structure that provides these companies resources and support to help them be successful. We will create a program to allow for externships between Kellogg’s (and possibly our partners) and the portfolio companies we invest into. Hardly a week goes by that I don’t receive an email from a brand manager, marketer, supply chain expert, or others at one of these public CPGs who are looking to move to a smaller company. This externship program will be an asset for the smaller brands while also acting as a retention tool and bringing innovation back to Kellogg’s. 4) M&amp;A. I’m not against M&amp;A, but I am against M&amp;A for the sole purpose of stripping cost as a strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. My belief is that in 10 years the revenue from the core existing products of many consumer companies will be much smaller than it is today. These products won’t be replaced by 1 or 2 new products, they’ll be replaced by hundreds – or thousands. That is the fragmentation of the consumer or what we have called in the past the Personalization of the Consumer. Big CPG can either buy these products (at an earlier stage) or lose to them. I would want our company to ingest a lot of smaller brands rather than forking out hundreds of millions (or billions) of dollars once these brands are already big. We will need to also invest in the infrastructure necessary to work with many more brands and benefit from their growth. The brands will join the Kellogg’s family rather than threatening it. 5) Partnerships and joint ventures. Every now and then you will hear about a joint venture or partnership in consumer but they are few and far between. Why? I think a lot of times big consumer companies fear that partnering with another company will mean splitting profits which can negatively impact bottom line. This is not a productive attitude. You see examples of successful partnerships in almost every other industry- whether it’s Google teaming up with Walmart to offer Walmart products on Google Express, or Chrysler teaming up with Waymo to work on driverless cars, partnering with a variety of stakeholders can often help foster the best innovation. I also think there is a big opportunity to partner with other consumer companies to foster education in the sector itself. We could host conferences that bring together the best consumer entrepreneurs and the brightest ideas and we would all benefit as a result. Why this matters If my plan as CEO were effectively implemented, I think we would see three powerful effects. Firstly, by making more small bets on more emerging brands and building a culture of innovation, Kellogg’s would become a dominant player in consumer goods. They will no longer fear being displaced. They will be the ones creating and harnessing the disruption. Secondly, this roadmap would ensure that the best products make it into the hands of consumers and that everyone has access to a wider variety of foods and healthier options. Finally, by building this infrastructure, Kellogg’s would be able to assist entrepreneurs with their distribution, brand, supply chain, and team. As these companies grow and succeed, this will also result in increased value for shareholders. Consumer is an extremely inefficient market, but Kellogg’s can be the public company that helps change that. Again, it’s easy for me to suggest strategies like this. It’s much harder to implement them when you’re on the inside looking out. I think a lot of Big CPG CEOs probably do have bold ideas that would help their companies in the long run, they are just unable to pursue them in an environment that obsesses on the short term – a board that demands immediate cost cuts and a market that demands immediate stock value. So these CEOs are hamstrung and left to rearrange chairs on the deck of the Titanic while the whole ship is sinking. They fear that if they do too much to try to save the ship they won’t last long. Gates, Musk, and Bezos are free to be visionary and push their companies to the cutting edge of innovation while Cahillane (CEO of Kellogg’s), Hees (Kraft- Heinz), and Quincey (Coke) have to work within the box they are put in. I truly hope that big consumer companies will begin to innovate, be creative, and listen to what consumers want- and that corporate boards and Wall Street will realize the long-term value of these things.

Devin Coldewey,"If you’re confused by the avalanche of early reports, denials, and conflicting statements about the massive security issues announced today, don’t worry — you’re far from the only one. Here’s what you need to know about Meltdown and Spectre, the two huge bugs that affect practically every computer and device out there. What are these flaws? Short answer : Bugs at a fundamental level that allow critical information stored deep inside computer systems to be exposed. Security researchers released official documentation — complete with nicknames and logos — of two major flaws found in nearly all modern central processing units, or CPUs. It’s not a physical problem with the CPUs themselves, or a plain software bug you might find in an application like Word or Chrome. It’s in between, at the level of the processors’ “architectures,” the way all the millions of transistors and logic units work together to carry out instructions. In modern architectures, there are inviolable spaces where data passes through in raw, unencrypted form, such as inside the kernel, the most central software unit in the architecture, or in system memory carefully set aside from other applications. This data has powerful protections to prevent it from being interfered with or even observed by other processes and applications. Meltdown and Spectre are two techniques researchers have discovered that circumvent those protections, exposing nearly any data the computer processes, such as passwords, proprietary information, or encrypted communications. Meltdown affects Intel processors, and works by breaking through the barrier that prevents applications from accessing arbitrary locations in kernel memory. Segregating and protecting memory spaces prevents applications from accidentally interfering with one another’s data, or malicious software from being able to see and modify it at will. Meltdown makes this fundamental process fundamentally unreliable. Spectre affects Intel, AMD, and ARM processors, broadening its reach to include mobile phones, embedded devices, and pretty much anything with a chip in it. Which, of course, is everything from thermostats to baby monitors now. It works differently from Meltdown; Spectre essentially tricks applications into accidentally disclosing information that would normally be inaccessible, safe inside their protected memory area. This is a trickier one to pull off, but because it’s based on an established practice in multiple chip architectures, it’s going to be even trickier to fix. Who is affected? Short answer : Pretty much everybody. Chips going back to 2011 were tested and found vulnerable, and theoretically it could affect processors as far back as those released in 1995. One would hope there aren’t too many of those in use, but we may be unpleasantly surprised on that count. Because Meltdown and Spectre are flaws at the architecture level, it doesn’t matter whether a computer or device is running Windows, OS X, Android, or something else — all software platforms are equally vulnerable. The vast majority of devices, from laptops to smartphones to servers, are therefore affected. The assumption going forward should be that any untested device should be considered vulnerable. Not only that, but Meltdown in particular could conceivably be applied to and across cloud platforms, where huge numbers of networked computers routinely share and transfer data among thousands or millions of users and instances. The good news is that the attack is easiest to perform by code being run by the machine itself — it’s not easy to pull this off remotely. So there’s that, at least. Can this be fixed? Short answer : Only partially, and it’s going to take a while. Meltdown can be fixed essentially by building a stronger wall around the kernel; the technical term is “kernel page table isolation.” This solves the issue, but there’s a cost. Modern CPU architectures assume certain things about the way the kernel works and is accessed, and changing those things means that they won’t be able to operate at full capacity. The Meltdown fix may reduce the performance of Intel chips by as little as 5 percent or as much as 30 — but there will be some hit. Whatever it is, it’s better than the alternative. Spectre, on the other hand, is not likely to be fully fixed any time soon. The fact is that the practice that leads to this attack being possible is so hard-wired into processors that the researchers couldn’t find any way to totally avoid it. They list a few suggestions, but conclude: While the stop-gap countermeasures described in the previous section may help limit practical exploits in the short term, there is currently no way to know whether a particular code construction is, or is not, safe across today’s processors – much less future designs. What will actually happen is hard to say, but there will likely be a flurry of updates that carry out various software hacks to protect against the most obvious and damaging attacks. Microsoft has already issued one for Windows; ARM has a set of mitigations for its affected chips; Amazon is updating its many servers. How broadly and quickly will these mitigation patches be applied, though? How many devices are out there, vulnerable, right now? These updates may not be pretty, perhaps requiring changes that will break other software, drivers, and components. And all will likely involve degrading performance. A more permanent fix will require significant changes across the board — the circuit board, that is. Basic architecture choices that have been baked into our devices for years, even decades, will have to be rethought. It won’t be easy, and it won’t be fun. In the meantime companies are working at full capacity to minimize the apparent threat: “mitigations” that may or may not prevent some or all of the variant attacks. As usual, these patches will likely reach only a small subset of new, fast-updating users and devices. We will only know the efficacy of these measures by their performance in the real world. It’s worth noting that there won’t be a “recall.” If this flaw affected a single device, like the battery problems in Samsung’s phones a while back, a recall would make sense. But this is an issue that affects millions, perhaps billions of devices. A recall isn’t an option. Why are we only just hearing about this? Short answer : A planned joint disclosure was preempted by reporters. It’s always a bit odd to hear that companies were informed of a major security flaw like this one months ago, as was the case with Meltdown and Spectre. This particular exploit has been under investigation for some time by researchers, and word of it trickled out in the form of small updates to various operating systems addressing a hitherto-undocumented security flaw. If the researchers just tweeted out the details when they discovered them, it would essentially be giving attackers access to that information at the same time as the companies that can fix the problem. Generally security investigators do what’s called responsible disclosure, contacting affected companies secretly, either as a simple courtesy or in order to collaborate on a solution. In this case Google contacted Intel several months ago, and no doubt others knew to some degree as well, since Microsoft issued patches to insiders well ahead of the public announcement, and Linux distributions were likewise addressing the issue even though the papers describing the flaw were not out yet. The plan would normally be that the affected company or companies would come up with a solution, quietly apply it, then announce both the flaw and the solution at the same time. And in fact that seems to be what was planned in this case. But smart reporting by The Register, which among others put together the disparate pieces, seems to have forced the hands of several billion-dollar companies. The companies scrambled to finalize their statements, addressing “inaccurate” media reports and hastily issuing patches and explanations that likely weren’t due until next week. While some may suggest that El Reg should have let things take their course, there’s a great deal to be said for not allowing the billion-dollar companies in question to completely control the narrative around a major issue like this. If the only version of the story we ever heard was one approved by their joint committee, things would likely have been painted in a different light. As the researchers put it at the end of the the Spectre paper: The vulnerabilities in this paper, as well as many others, arise from a longstanding focus in the technology industry on maximizing performance. As a result, processors, compilers, device drivers, operating systems, and numerous other critical components have evolved compounding layers of complex optimizations that introduce security risks. As the costs of insecurity rise, these design choices need to be revisited, and in many cases alternate implementations optimized for security will be required.","If you’re confused by the avalanche of early reports, denials, and conflicting statements about the massive security issues announced today, don’t worry — you’re far from the only one.

Sam Rutherford,"At Acer’s annual global press conference today, the company announced its usual assortment of new computers ranging from humble tablets built for education to the wild desktop rigs with dual Xeon CPUs. But among Acer’s avalanche of metal and silicon, there was one device that felt like an anchor for the company’s growth and success: the new Chromebook Spin 13. For years, Acer has made some of the best Chromebooks you could buy, and with the new 2-in-1 Chromebook Spin 13, Acer is keeping the newfound flexibility found on last year’s R13, while upping the ante with a new an all new, more premium feeling design. 1 / 5 Taking a cue from the Google Pixelbook, the Chromebook Spin 13 features a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio instead of a traditional 16:9 ldisplay. Then, Acer went and replaced the big long hinge on the R13 with a more standard two-sided setup, before tacking on a new one-piece Gorilla Glass touchpad. And unlike Acer Chromebooks of old couple years ago, the Spin 13 sports a full metal chassis that should give it some added durability and a touch of class. The Chromebook Spin 13 shouldn’t be hurting on power either thanks to your choice of 8th-gen Intel Core i3 or i5 CPUs, up to 16GB of RAM, and either 32GB, 64GB or 128GB of storage. The Spin 13 even features built-in Wacom stylus support (including an onboard hidey hold for stashing the active pen when its not in use), so you can save handwritten notes or sketches with ease. But perhaps the best thing about the Chromebook Spin 13 is that it looks like its going to cost half the price of Google’s slick, but expensive $1,000 Pixelbook. Prices are going to start at $400 for a non-2-in-1 Chromebook 13, while the the 13 Spin will command a $100 premium on top of that. And just in case you wanted something slightly bigger, Acer is also making 15-inch versions of its new Chromebook, including the new $450 Chromebook Spin 15, which Acer claims is the world’s first 15-inch Chrome OS convertible.","At Acer’s annual global press conference today, the company announced its usual assortment of new computers ranging from humble tablets built for education to the wild desktop rigs with dual Xeon CPUs.

Kristen V. Brown,"I was crawling around on the floor, chasing my cat, Avalanche, as she artfully wriggled away from me over and over again to gnaw at the piece of tape I had stuck to her gray and white fur. Avalanche had unwittingly become a victim of journalistic inquiry: I wanted to explore the latest fad in consumer DNA testing, genetic analysis for pets. But rather than somehow coax my cat to spit in a tube, Basepaws required that I stick a piece of tape to Avalanche’s body, then “gently” pull it off. Except it turns out that there is no way to gently rip tape off of an animal completely covered in two-inch-long fur. My cat was furious with me for hours. The market for at-home DNA tests has exploded. Curious to find out about their ancestry, risk of disease, diet, and athletic potential, millions of people are hawking gobs of spit into test tubes and shipping them off to companies like AncestryDNA and 23andMe. But human DNA testing is not the only thing that’s trending. Increasingly, people are DNA testing their pets. Now, why, you ask, would anyone want to DNA test their cat or dog? For Mirja Bauer, it was about her dog’s health. When she adopted Bagel, she was told he was a Dalmatian mix. And Dalmatians tend to suffer from a host of genetic problems, including urinary stones. “I wanted to do the DNA test to see if she really was a Dalmatian,” Bauer told Gizmodo. Knowing a dog’s breed can help an owner manage or prevent health issues that are breed-specific, as well as give insight into breed-specific behaviors. So she ordered a doggie DNA test from Embark, which offers a cheek-swab test that tells owners about their dog’s breed, health, and even traits like athletic performance. Bagel, it turned out, was not a Dalmatian at all, but a mix of Boxer and Staffordshire bull terrier. The test gave her peace of mind. “I found out that she’s really really healthy,” said Bauer. “I think there was 160 diseases that they tested for. And she’s clear [on] of 156 of those.” For most pet owners, the main interest is simply curiosity (and bragging rights) about their dog’s breed. Philip Berne, a writer in Dallas, adopted his dog, Moose, right after Hurricane Harvey had displaced many, many pets. Moose, Berne was told, was a dachshund puppy and was deaf because of a genetic condition. “I’ve always been curious about his genetics because he doesn’t look like other dachshunds,” Berne said. He ordered the Wisdom Panel breed detection test. His hunch, it turned out, was right. “Moose is 50 percent Chihuahua, 25 percent dachshund, and 25 percent poodle,” he reported. “I was shocked.” Another company, Animal Biome, will even sequence the microbiome of your dog or cat. From bacterial DNA in a poop sample, Animal Biome will tell you about the microbe makeup of your pet’s gut, along with information about how this impacts digestive health. At least when it comes to breed, doggie DNA tests are significantly more accurate than ancestry tests for humans. Dog breeds are, in essence, human-made. While what makes a Norwegian a Norwegian is hard to pin down, what makes a German Shepherd a German Shepherd is much more well-defined. “We have much better records of German Shepherds than we do Italians,” Angela Hughes, the veterinary genetics research manager at Wisdom Health, said. As with human tests, a company’s algorithm and DNA database can cause some variability between two different tests. And the more mixed the dog is the, the harder it is to pin down specifics. But a dog that gets a German Shepard test result is pretty likely to actually be a German Shepard. And like human tests, as testing company databases grow, that accuracy will only improve. The domesticated dog is actually a close evolutionary relation to humans, compared to many other animals, and its DNA is fairly well-studied. A lot of health information can be gleaned from insight into a dog’s breed alone. Unlike health-risk tests for humans, the health information offered on doggie tests doesn’t have to pass through the FDA’s regulatory approval. The studies that back the results on these tests tend to be smaller and fewer in number than those looking at human disease risk. Because of that, said Hughes, Widsom Panel can act as part of the research process, validating or debunking study results based on what its testing finds. Cats are even more poorly studied, and only one company, Basepaws, offers a commercial breed test. That’s the test I foisted upon my cat, Avalanche. (I also put her through a test from Wisdom Panel, though that test is primarily marketed to cat breeders.) I adopted Avalanche last April from the SCPA in San Francisco when she was an adorable, palm-sized kitten. She is short-haired, with white-and-gray, tabby-striped spots. Avalanche spends most her day staring out the window trying to imitate bird sounds or attacking her favorite toy, my appropriately named Cat Palm. I have no idea what breed she is. This is not a question most people ask cat owners. And, even if you did know a cat’s breed, it would not be nearly as useful as knowing the breed of a dog, because cats are simply not studied as often. (Even though, as this story points out, they may actually be better models for human disease.) Still, I ordered a kit from Basepaws and proceeded to rip a fine layer of fur off of Avalanche with the included sticky tape. Wisdom Panel also sent me its cat breeder test, for which I swabbed her cheek. (This went much more smoothly; she kind of enjoyed gnawing on the swab.) I even raided Avalanche’s litter box to collect a sample of her poop for the Animal Biome test. If bisecting your cat’s poo isn’t love, I’m not sure what is. “When a person a pet owner gets this new cat from the shelter, they really don’t know anything about it,” said Anna Skaya, who founded Basepaws in 2016. Like dog owners, most cat owners are curious about whether their pet is a certain breed or is genetically predisposed to certain health issues. “Most cats are mutts, most cats domestic short-hairs,” Skaya conceded. “But even if that’s the case, you still are closer to some breeds than others.” And, Skaya said, she hopes the data they collect will be useful to help forward cat genetic research. Here’s what I found out from my cat’s tests: Avalanche doesn’t have any known genetic conditions. According to Wisdom Panel, she is “genetically black” with a solid coat, though my own visual assessment confirmed that she is in fact gray and white. (The test also suggested it is likely that she has a tabby pattern, which she does.) And, as I suspected, she is a mutt. As with any genetic endeavor, testing your pet’s DNA is a game of probability. Genetics is a science of comparison—you measure your dog or cat’s genes against other dog and cat genes to see how they relate.

 Tourists struggled in heavy snow near Untertauern in Austria
At least seven people have died in the Alps during a weekend of heavy snow, with skiers facing a high avalanche risk in Austria, Germany and Italy.
Two separate avalanches killed two German skiers in Austria's Vorarlberg mountains. A third skier died in Pongau district, near Salzburg.
In Bavaria, a skier died when a tree collapsed near Bad Tölz. An avalanche killed a young woman in Bavaria's Teisenberg mountains.
Two climbers died in the Italian Alps.
A mountain rescue team found their bodies in the area of 2,800m (9,186ft) Mt Cristalliera, in the Alps north of Turin.
Rescuers are searching for several missing people elsewhere in the Alps.
The second-highest avalanche warning level is now in force across the Austrian Tyrol and in much of the Bavarian Alps.
Skiers have been warned to avoid any off-piste skiing, and many mountain roads have been closed because of the avalanche risk. 
Italy is in the grip of a cold snap - snow has even reached Matera, in the far south. There is also snow on Mt Vesuvius near Naples - a rare sight.

KELLY VIRELLA,"What is 52 Places To Go and how did you come up with the idea for this job? Every year we create this really lavish, beautiful interactive, 52 Places to Go. And we keep it at 52 places because we want readers to think about going to a new place every week. So this year what I decided to do in addition to having readers think about the places every week is to actually send someone to every single place on the list in 2018. And apparently that’s something a lot of people want to do. I was just flooded with job applicants. Tell us about the cultural phenomenon that ensued when you posted the listing. People seized on things I said in interviews and started sending me things unsolicited. You can see some of it sitting in my office. I said I was looking for the perfect unicorn who has it all. So I got my unicorns. I also got a stuffed unicorn that is I think about 3 feet high. We can’t keep gifts like that. So I actually donated that to raise funds for our Neediest Cases Fund. So it went to a worthy cause. Unicorn candidate for that @nytimestravel gig, meeting editor @monicadrake rn. pic.twitter.com/Cy7ga9398x — Sam Sifton (@SamSifton) Oct. 31, 2017 One of my favorite reactions to the job was a Medium post. Someone claimed to crack the code to getting the job and created this lovely flowchart that starts out, “Are you or are you not Anthony Bourdain?” If the answer is yes, you just don’t change a thing and presumably you would get this job. I followed this flowchart, and based on it I don’t know if I would get the job. And people created memes. 11:59p today: Everyone, their second cousin's plumber, and the 4,273 messages in. @monicadrake 's inbox:. @nytimestravel #52Places pic.twitter.com/N3xZOoDLgf — Elisa Mala (@Elisa_Mala) Nov. 1, 2017 Justin Trudeau did not apply for the job. This is satire. People did create websites to promote their applications. One guy who created one is a friend of Al B. Sure!, who made this video on his behalf. A Special Message for Monica from Al B. Sure! Video by R Dub A 14-year-old version of me is very excited that Al B. Sure! knows my name right now. Actually, current me is very excited that Al B. Sure! knows my name right now. But things like this have no bearing on whether you get the job, because I didn’t ask everyone to submit a celebrity friend video. So obviously everyone who ever dreamed of spending a year traveling the world applied for this job. Tell us a little about their backgrounds. I was really heartened by the wide variety of people who applied. We got a lot of people who don’t have a traditional background for being a reporter for The Times. First of all, a lot of baristas applied. We got a lot of people from tech companies. We got somebody who used to be coal miner and was trying to become a travel photographer. We got a lot of teachers — a lot of history teachers. We also got flight attendants, probably because they like to travel and don’t get to do it at a slower pace. Actors, actresses, we got some models, a mechanic writing from Russia, an airplane refueler. We got a physics professor, a dance professor. We got a lot of writers who are really great feature writers. We got a lot of applicants who were photographers or make documentaries. We also got a lot of people who work in television. We got a lot of people who work in broadcast television, anchors or hosts. A lot of people who work on sports too — a lot of people who cover sports, a lot of anchors, a lot of producers. With 9,000 applications, how did you manage to evaluate everyone? We looked at every single one of them, I’m proud to say. There was a team of four of us and we set up sessions. We divided up the list, created these immense spreadsheets with titles, positions, experience skills, and scanned the spreadsheets. If anything jumped out at us, we would dive into the application material to find out about the person. That yielded a lot of surprises. A lot of people who I wouldn’t expect to be good at writing and putting together a story were actually good at it. What are you looking for in this travel writer? The qualifications are quite broad because I wanted to make sure that people who applied were not just travel journalists and not just writers, but people who are really good at visual storytelling. I’m looking for someone who loves travel. We got a little pushback at one point for asking for someone who has travel experience. Even though travel seems fun, working and writing while you’re traveling is actually a job and it’s a skill that you get better at over time. I’m looking for someone who can really parachute into a place, get to know what it’s like, share with our readers and viewers what it’s like on social media, using video, using images; someone who can write a piece that appears on our site and in print as well. Where are you in the process? We are now sort of narrowing down and selecting the top candidates. For the top candidates, we’re thinking of choosing more along the lines of 100, rather than just 10 or so. We’ll be reaching out to those people for the next couple of weeks, just asking for more information and asking questions. We’re also trying to figure out how to engage all of the applicants, regardless of whether they make the cut, trying to figure out how to engage them in the trip and get their perspective. I’ll have some updates on that going forward. After we reach out to everybody, we’re going to announce our selection. I’m calling it informally — in house — the traveler job. We’re going to announce our traveler when we publish our next 52 Places list in mid-January.

Sam Rutherford,"While the avalanche of announcements may have made it seem otherwise, today officially marks the first day of Mobile World Congress 2019, and aside from all the ambitious, weird, and sophisticated new handsets on display at the show, without a doubt the other big topic for the show is 5G.
By now almost all the major carriers have already started deploying 5G networks, and with the announcement of the Galaxy S10 5G, a new 5G modem from Qualcomm, and even more 5G-ready phones to follow at MWC, it sort of feels like were reaching a critical mass for 5G momentum.
5G is supposed to mark the 5th generation of mobile communication, and with it, tech companies have been making lofty promises about what cell networks could offer in the not-too-distant future. Were talking about mobile data speeds potentially in excess of one Gbps, latencies of less than five or 10 milliseconds, and networks robust enough to handle the quickly growing number of IoT devices.
But before anyone goes HAM on a 5G tech spending spree this year, there are three big things that have me feeling bearish on 5G between now and 2020.
5G is barely available
The first problem is the limited availability of 5G networks. Its true that depending on where you live, you might be lucky enough to have 5G coverage in your area. If you look at the list of cities with 5G coverage, outside of places like New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and a handful of metro areas in Texas, theres very little 5G signal to be found. (Just take a look at these maps for a general sense of where 5G coverage is really at.) In fact, right now Sprint doesnt have 5G coverage of any kind and will be starting from scratch when it launches 5G in nine markets beginning as soon as May. 
AT&amp;T is doing a bit better with 12 cities that have 5G coverage of some kind. But if you read carefully, its important to note that even AT&amp;T says 5G+ (which is AT&amp;Ts nonsense term for real 5G) is only available in select areas within these locations. Translation: You shouldnt anticipate reliable 5G coverage even if youre in these places. So youll need to figure out if your home is covered as well as other places you frequently visit to ensure you get the full 5G experience.
Verizon started its push into 5G late last year when it introduced what are essentially 5G hotspots meant to be used in homes, while also building out its mobile infrastructure in preparation for the arrival of 5G-ready phones in 2019. Currently, Verizons in-home 5G is available in limited areas or LA, Sacramento, Houston, Indianapolis.
Meanwhile, due to T-Mobiles disdain for Verizon and AT&amp;Ts 5G pucks, the carrier chose to skip making 5G hotspots and instead deploy 5G on its 600 MHz spectrum in a smattering of cities. In contrast to the millimeter wave 5G installations favored by AT&amp;T and Verizon, T-Mobiles low-band 5G offers better range and signal penetration into buildings. However, those benefits come with the downside that low-band cant quite hit the one Gbps data speeds or super fast latency that a lot of people think of in regards to the potential benefits of 5G. And while the company has pledged to bring 5G to 30 cities by the end of the year, even T-Mobile itself admits it wont have nationwide 5G until 2020.
5G phones will be way too expensive
The second concern for 5G is all the money youll need to spend upgrading your tech. Unless you are the unicorn that bought a Moto Z3 last year hoping to be the first kid on the block with a 5G mod, anyone even thinking about trying out mobile 5G will need to buy a new phone. Thats means at minimum, youre looking at spending at least $500 on a new phone, plus whatever the cost of the Moto 5G mod will be.
Alternatively, if youre thinking about buying a more traditional 5G-ready phone that doesnt need separate attachments, consider this: Back in December, OnePlus founder Carl Pei said that he expects the companys upcoming 5G phone to command a $200-$300 premium over a normal 4G LTE phone. Thats a lot of extra dough to spend on a phone for somewhat nebulous benefits.
Meanwhile, even though Samsung listed prices for the new $750 Galaxy S10E, $900 S10, $1,000 S10+, and the painfully expensive $2,000 Galaxy Fold, Samsung did not provide pricing for the Galaxy S10 5G. But if we do some rough math and use the S10+ $1,000 price tag as a starting point, and then factor in the S10 5Gs giant 6.7-inch screen, its two depth-of-flight cameras, and its all-important 5G modem and antennas, were looking at a phone that could easily cost $1,500 or more.
Its a sort of similar situation for LGs V50 5G because even though it was announced, neither LG nor Sprint (the V50's first 5G carrier) has announced pricing for the phone. Additionally, it seems like phone makers know these phones will be hard to move based purely on the inclusion of 5G, so both LG and Samsung added things to their 5G phones like depth-sensing cameras or a dual-screen accessory to help increase their value.
In short, anyone thinking about getting a 5G phone in 2019 will need to have more than $1,000 to burn, and thats not even considering if 5G phone plans will likely cost more than normal, which is something carriers havent talked about yet.
5Gs coolest applications dont exist yet
Finally, for most people, the speed isnt worth it. At least not yet. Thats because one of the promises of 5G is the ability to have all sort of devices like drones, cars with cell connections, TVs, and more, all connected to each other all the time so that they can communicate on a super fast wireless network. The problem is that all those various 5G-devices and 5G apps dont really exist yet. 
Right now, if you were to have a 5G phone attached to a 5G network functioning at peak speeds, what would that actually give you? You could probably download a ton of movies and music real quick, but if youre thinking about streaming, its not like theres an abundance of 4K content to watch.
Samsungs 5G MLB demo app was cool, but not something that can be replicated at scale yet.

At Samsungs booth at MWC, the company demoed an S10 5G running off of what was purportedly a live 5G network that was displaying a stream of an MLB game where you could control the video feed from a number of different cameras. Its a neat application of the massive bandwidth 5G offers, allowing you to switch from the camera behind home plate to one pointed at first base. But the app was a one-off creation, not something any baseball fan can get just by purchasing a 5G phone.
And with the possibility of sub 10ms latency on 5G, you might be able to play multiplayer games like PUBG, or Smash Bros or Apex Legends (via mobile tethering) with the same kind of lag-free experience you get on wi-fi at home. But thats about it. The power of the so-called 5G revolution only happens when every device can tap into those kinds of speeds, not just a single device.
As far as 2019 goes, the main groups that might be able to use mobile 5G effectively are businesses that can take advantage of all that bandwidth to send massive files securely back and forth between various off-site locations.
5G is still the future
Now all this doesnt mean Im down on 5G, as the tech has tons of future potential. Testing out new tech is fun, and being an early adopter gives you first-hand experience observing how new platforms ecosystems develop over time. But for 2019, its important to realize what mobile 5G really is: a glorified beta test. At best, its like pre-ordering something or funding a Kickstarter, both of which are moves fueled more by hopes and dreams than anything based in reality.
So if youre someone with spare cash lying around, and you are curious about 5Gor are the kind of person who likes posting First in YouTube videosgo ahead, dive into 5G. But for everyone else, youll save a bunch of money by waiting, and with 5G adoption rates for phones only expected to hit 0.4 percent in 2019, you wont miss out on much either.","While the avalanche of announcements may have made it seem otherwise, today officially marks the first day of Mobile World Congress 2019, and aside from all the ambitious, weird, and sophisticated new handsets on display at the show, without a doubt the other…",2019-02-25T15:54:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",5G Is Going to Be an Incredibly Tough Sell in 2019,https://gizmodo.com/5g-is-going-to-be-an-incredibly-tough-sell-in-2019-1832771232,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--lEQGSdkh--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/n4ei4kxagbavhwna7epu.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,avalanche,1
Reporter / Producer,"Parks Canada officials confirm the ice climber injured in a slide in Yoho National Park on Monday afternoon has died in hospital.
The woman was participating in a guided ice climb on the Massey's route on  Mt. Stephen, east of Field, British Columbia, at approximately 2:00 p.m. Monday when an avalanche occurred.
Emergency crews responded to the scene and the woman, who was believed to be approximately 30 years old, was airlifted to the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary by STARS Air Ambulance. At the time of transport, she was considered to be in critical, life threatening condition. The nature of her injuries was not disclosed.
According to Parks Canada, the woman passed away in hospital on Tuesday. The identity of the deceased has not been released.
At the time of the slide, the avalanche danger rating in the area was considered to be moderate in the alpine and low in the treeline and below. Risk of avalanche in Yoho National Park is expected to increase in the coming days given the forecasted snow and wind.

Eric Francis,"CALGARY Matthew Tkachuk isnt too sure how it got to this, but the brotherly love he and David Rittich have been showing ever since their trip to Philadelphia is attracting attention.
At the conclusion of the Calgary Flames‘ last three wins, Tkachuk has wrapped up high-fives with every teammate with a jubilant, one-on-one embrace with Rittich that both find hard to describe.
I dont know how it started but a little hug turned into a big hug, turned into a jump and hug and now it turned into a big jump and hug – it kind of keeps going, we keep creating something, said Tkachuk Wednesday morning, laughing when a staffer suggested he didnt want to see how much further their enthusiasm might take them.
This might be the last stage of that.
Hours later the Tkachittich jump/hug was executed once again after “Big Save Dave” absolutely stole one for the Flames.
They kept it civil, with Tkachuk bouncing several times before leaping into Rittich as the horn sounded and teammates saluted the fans.
This time the whole squad likely wanted to jump into the arms of the 26-year-old goaltending godsend who has played as big a role in the Flames’ turnaround season as anyone.
On this night, the ask was to make 35 saves against a Colorado team spearheaded by the best line in hockey.
He made 32 of them in a 5-3 win the Flames otherwise didnt deserve.
A fluke goal off the pants of Michael Frolik wound up the difference in a game that saw the Flames throw just 15 shots at a still-struggling Semyon Varlamov.
Thus, the Flames third-straight win with Rittich back from injury ended with man-hugs.
I did it because he saved my ass, laughed Rittich when asked how the animated embrace came to be following a late comeback orchestrated by Tkachuk in Philly.
This time Rittich was returning the favour, moving his record to a remarkable 16-4-3.
Heading into the first of five straight home dates, the focus was on the top two lines in the NHL.
Including Tkachuck, the game included seven of the NHLs top 17 scorers. Only two NHL games dating back to 1992 have had as many top-20 snipers.
The storyline by nights end was how much better the Avs trio of Mikko Rantanen, Gabriel Landeskog and Nathan MacKinnon was in a game they appeared to be taking over in the second period.
After one period, they were the only Avs forwards to record shots on goal.
By the end of the second, only two other Colorado forwards had added to the shot count, as the top guns alone were on the verge of breaking a 2-2 game wide open with relentless pressure. The big three finished with 23 total shots, including 12 by Landeskog.
If not for Rittich things might have gotten out of hand.
Alas, a Flames power-play goal by Elias Lindholm with seven minutes left in the second turned the entire game around.
Rittich helped them hang on from there.
I think they were the quicker team from the first period right until the end and the shots would support that, said Bill Peters of an opportunistic bunch coming off a four-game roadie on which they won three times.
Their pace throughout the lineup gave us trouble at times. We found a way to grind it out. That was a timely goal by Lindy for sure. Thats a dangerous group.
Johnny Gaudreaus five-game goal streak ended, but his sixgame point binge continued with two assists, giving him 15 points in that stretch.
Five-on-five, his line with Sean Monahan and Lindholm was vastly overshadowed by the Avalanche Aces, who ended the night dealing with a verbal meltdown on the bench by MacKinnon that appeared to be directed at coach Jared Bednar. Colorado has one win in its last nine.
It wasnt our A game for sure but good teams find a way to win and I think we got better as the game went on our third period was our best period and thats what youve got to do at this time of year, said Mark Jankowski, who spearheaded a penalty kill that stopped all four Avalanche advantages.
(Rittich) has been a star a lot of games this year he held us in when we shouldnt have been in there and held the door tight for us to get a couple.
Jankowski and Mikael Backlund also scored first-period goals to open the game.
Froliks lucky goal midway through the third period put the Flames up 4-2 and had fans on edge in the final 90 seconds when the two top lines faced off against each other.
A missed empty-net opportunity by the Flames led to a Rantanen goal that forced Tkachuk to score an empty-netter in the final 10 seconds.
Cue the hug.","Rittich steals win for Flames against NHL’s best line Sportsnet.ca Giordano has three assists as Flames down Avalanche TSN Preview: Calgary Flames vs Colorado Avalanche, 1/9/19 (45/82): Flames Can’t Take Struggling Avs Lightly Matchsticks and Gasoline Flames …",2019-01-10T06:54:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sportsnet.ca'}",Rittich steals win for Flames against NHL’s best line - Sportsnet.ca,https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/rittich-steals-win-flames-best-line-hockey/,https://assets4.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/david-rittich-flames-avalanche.jpg,,Sportsnet.ca,avalanche,1
Matthias Gafni,"LAKE TAHOE — Heather Turning and her boyfriend were taking a rest about a quarter of the way down Squaw Valley’s K-22 mountain, beneath the Olympic Lady chairlift, when they both heard a noise and looked up the hill. Rockets of snow exploded through the trees, followed by a loud roar, as if rushing water had been released from flood gates. The gully beside them disappeared in a mist of snow. “Avalanche!” someone yelled. “It changed the entire terrain,” Turning said. “We could feel pellets of snow when it roared by us.” In under a minute, Turning said they watched a 40-yard-wide wall of snow break off a rock outcropping above them and funnel into a steep gully tossing skiers and snowboarders aside, burying one, before coming to a stop about 50 to 100 yards below them. The pair had just witnessed a rare “inbounds avalanche,” inside the resort boundaries, near the Olympic Lady chairlift. Five people were hit by the mass of snow with two being hospitalized, one with a serious lower body injury, according to Squaw Valley. The resort received 68 inches of snow from Thursday to Saturday. The massive winter storm across California created some perilous avalanche dangers. On Saturday, Mammoth Mountain had its own avalanche in the Southern California resort. Six employees working a chairlift were partially covered in snow. No one was injured. On Friday, after the Squaw Valley avalanche stormed past Turning and her boyfriend, the mist quickly cleared and the Roseville pair saw about six people still standing in the area. People started yelling and checking on each other and everyone seemed OK. Turning, who had taken an avalanche survival course about six years ago, started searching for her beacon or probe in case there were rescues needed. Suddenly, screams came from the bottom of the ravine. “I can’t find my husband! Find my husband! Help!” a woman yelled. “I just thought: ‘Crap,’ ” Turning said. The couple snowboarded down toward the area and Turning unbuckled her snowboard, crawling through waist-high snow at the foot of the avalanche. Four or five people were already frantically digging, flinging snow into the air, captured in a short 10-second video clip. A skier had spotted the tip of a man’s snowboard sticking out of the snow. By the time Turning reached the man, his face and upper body had been cleared of about two to three feet of snow. Turning worked to free him from his bindings and gently brushed snow off of his face and beard as ski patrol arrived with shovels. Video posted on Instagram captured those final moments of the rescue, with the snowboarder smiling as jubilant rescuers continued digging him out. A snow patrol rescuer told the man he had been under the snow for six minutes. “He had blacked out and when we pulled the snow away from his face he came to,” Turning said. “He was so lucky.” The first thing the snowboarder asked Turning was: “Is my wife OK?” The man told her when the avalanche hit he was “tossed all about.” Once freed, the rescuers all exchanged a quick fist bump with the unidentified skier who had spotted the snowboard. His wife gave the uninjured husband a big hug. The pair had just started a three-week ski vacation at a variety of resorts in the Sierras, Turning said. Turning, who was celebrating her 39th birthday that day, said the entire episode was “surreal.” The pair even snowboarded down with the buried snowboarder and his wife to the resort lodge. “We took the nice and easy way down,” Turning said. “It was kind of quiet. He was kind of in shock, but healthy and intact.”","The Mercury News Rescuer describes harrowing avalanche rescue of… The Mercury News This screenshot from a video of a reported rescue shows people digging out someone who was buried during a March 2, 2018, avalanche at a Squaw Valley resort near Lake Tahoe.

http://www.facebook.com/ktla5,"Five people were swept up in an avalanche at a Lake Tahoe-area ski resort, hours after the body of a missing snowboard had been discovered there, as a powerful winter storm pounded much of the state on Friday. More than 100 search and rescue officials and several rescue dogs responded to Squaw Valley Ski Resort after the avalanche roared down a mountain near the Olympic Lady chairlift around 1:40 p.m., according to a statement from the resort. Two women and three men were eventually rescued from beneath the snow. One person suffered a ""serious lower body injury"" and was hospitalized, while another was treated for injuries at a medical facility near the resort and later released, Squaw Valley staff said. Placer County sheriff's officials said none of the injuries were life-threatening, and the other three people were able to leave the scene unharmed. Heather Turping told the Associated Press she was snowboarding when a scream of “Avalanche!” rang out and she saw “a cloud of snow coming down.” “It was massive,” she said. “It just happened to literally pass a foot in front of me.” Turping said she helped a woman dig her husband out after they spotted his snowboard protruding from beneath the blanket of snow. “When he got uncovered, a ski patroller said, ‘You were under for six minutes,’” she said. All missing people have since been accounted for, the resort said. It's unknown what triggered the avalanche, and the incident is under investigation. Guests at the resort had been warned of the potential danger, and explosives and other preventative measures were used on Friday, but the snowfall was heavy, Squaw Valley spokeswoman Liesl Hepburn told the AP. Following the avalanche, the resort was closed for the remainder of the day. All skiing and riding operations had been suspended earlier in the day after a snowboarder, missing since the previous afternoon, was found dead. Rocklin resident Wenyu Zhang, 42, was found by Squaw Valley Ski Patrol, according to the Placer County Sheriff's Office. He had gone missing amid a blizzard that dropped nearly 3 feet of snow with gusts up to 150 mph. A location-tracking device Zhang was wearing assisted rescuers in finding his body, authorities said. A blizzard warning issued by the National Weather Service expired Friday, but a storm warning remains in effect until 10 a.m. Saturday. A series of evacuation orders and flood watches had also been issued across Southern California in connection with the weather event.

CHRISTINE HAUSER,"Mr. Crouch engaged the cornice. It snapped. He fell out of sight. “Avalanche, avalanche!” shouted Cam Fitzpatrick, a fellow snowboarder, who had been standing nearer to Mr. Crouch than the others. The group swung into action, setting off a mountainside rescue that had to be accomplished within minutes to beat the odds of death from trauma or suffocation. Mr. Crouch did not die. He was released on Friday from Vancouver General Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia, after being treated for broken vertebrae, a torn pancreas and other injuries. Nature had just taught him that extreme sports can quickly turn from thrill to peril. Mr. Crouch said on Instagram that the cornice “pulled me backward into a slide.” “It took me through about 1,000 feet and over several rock bands before I ended up at the bottom, buried with no oxygen for almost 5 minutes,” he wrote, thanking the group for saving him. The online community of board sports, both snow and surf, showed camaraderie. “Pray for Gold Medal U.S.A. Surf Team member and professional snowboarder, Brock Crouch!” U.S.A. Surfing, the sports governing body, wrote. Mr. Crouch, who has also competed in International Ski Federation snowboard events, and the others were in the Pemberton Ice Cap region of British Columbia to work with Absinthe Films, which makes snowboarding films. Weeks before they arrived, there had been an avalanche with a fatality in the region, and on Friday Shin Campos, a safety coordinator with Whistler Creek Productions in Canada, which was working with the group, said the group was aware. He said they carefully assessed the risks, such as taking into account temperature and winds, which can whip up snow and move it around to create destabilized patches that have not bonded. Photo The mountain in the Whistler backcountry area of Canada on April 22, where Brock Crouch, a snowboarder, was swept off the ridge in an avalanche. Credit John Jackson The group surveyed the mountains from a helicopter, chose their routes and then set down the aircraft to plan descents. “Most people look at these guys and say, ‘They just hike up and snowboard down,” he said. “It is much more involved.” John Jackson, 34, a professional backcountry rider from Nevada, said the group had airbags, shovels and other equipment. When Mr. Crouch dropped out of sight, they switched their radios to search mode. Mr. Campos flagged the pilot, who started up the helicopter. The riders knew they had to give chase, but first they had to navigate a safe route, cutting across debris and other hazards without putting themselves in danger or dropping more snow on the area where Mr. Crouch might be buried. With the help of the pilot, they maneuvered to the bottom where the avalanche had stalled, hoping Mr. Crouch had ended up that far. “When we were going down, in the back of our mind you are thinking, ‘Wow, we might be pulling out our dead friend,’” Mr. Jackson said. The pilot spied something in the mound — the tip of a snowboard. Hopes rose, but avalanches are so violent that they can rip away equipment — a glove, a pole, a backpack. It was around 2:15 p.m. The temperature, at 6,500 feet above sea level, was about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, as Mr. Jackson recalled. The men started to dig through packed snow. Within minutes, Mr. Jackson said, they exposed a boot, and then tried to gauge where Mr. Crouch’s head might be. As the snow was cleared, he was found folded up, his head near his feet, Mr. Jackson said. “He was taco’ed,” he said. “Because he was not directly upside down, his head was only two feet under the snow.” The bluish tint vanished from his face as they cleared snow from his airway. He moaned. They extracted his body, supporting his neck and back. Mr. Crouch was responsive, biting Mr. Jackson’s fingers. He had been buried for about five minutes. He had told his friends of trying to create an air pocket with his arms. “That is incredibly rare you have this success story,” Mr. Campos said. “The chance of survival goes down rapidly after two minutes.” In the hospital, Mr. Crouch shared photographs of his battered face. “I love snowboarding more today than I ever have and I can’t wait to get back on my board and shred with everyone again!” he wrote.

And if you wish to pour me coffee, do so from the Rite Press, a clever hack on the traditional French press that adds a few features that even high-end models don’t have. The press – which costs $35 for a half-liter model and $40 for the liter model – has hit its goal on Kickstarter and I’ve been able to play with it over the past few weeks. The press features two special features. One is a small, readable thermometer on the plunger that ensures your water temperature is well within the proper range for a good brew. Second, the system includes a magnetic timer that looks like something Hal Solo would use to time his Italian roast. It also has a very clever removable bottom that lets you clean out the grounds with ease. The Kickstarter ends in thirteen days and they are already well over their goal. Again, this is some low-tech stuff. You could buy a very basic French press for much less. I particularly like the design here and I suspect we should support the creation of new and unique kitchen gear or else be buried in an avalanche of status quo devices.

Erika I. Ritchie,"MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN – A major avalanche caused the closure of all lifts on Mammoth Mountain on Saturday. March 3. At about 10:15 a.m., ski patrol was performing avalanche control mitigation when the avalanche released on the upper mountain traveling toward the High Five express chair. Three individuals were partially buried in the avalanche and were able to free themselves, said Joni Lynch, senior director of brand marketing at the mountain. “The first searches with transceivers, avalanche dogs and a RECCO search have not produced any results,” she said. “The third stage of the avalanche protocol involving a manual probe search is underway.” All lifts stopped abruptly as first responders headed to the ski resort. Lift operations at Mammoth will be halted for the remainder of the day to focus full efforts on the site. A snow storm starting on Thursday dumped four feet at the base and more than six feet at the summit. The area where avalanche control work was conducted had been closed for skiing at the time of the incident. Avalanche debris traveled toward the bottom of the lift and ultimately crossed into an area that was open to the public. “We were in line and they shut down the lift,” said Talin Yepremian, 35, of Santa Barbara. “As someone not that skilled with these conditions today, it frightens me that it could have been me. It’s reassuring the response they had was so quick.” Jason Gerard, 36, of San Diego said he was on Chair 10 heading toward Chair 5, which was closed. He and his friend, Sven Gierlichs, 42, of San Diego, decided to take Chair 10 again to wait for Chair 5 to open. “When we came down lower Spook, adjacent ski run to where avalanche hit, and saw a bunch of sleds and snowmobiles.,” he said. “The liftees were screaming at us to stay away and take another run. ” Gierlichs, who grew up in Germany and has snowboarded for more than 20 years throughout the Alps, thought he heard the avalanche when it broke. “There was just this rumbling noise,” he said. “It sounded like ski patrol was doing it on purpose. It wouldn’t have crossed my mind that it was not on purpose. “When I’m at a resort, it never occurs to me that I could end up in an avalanche,” said Gerard, a software engineer. “I’ve ridden slack(out of bounds) and always carry an avalanche beacon. “They don’t know who’s under the snow,” he added. “I’m glad about how much response they had. It seems like they put everyone on it.” This is a developing story.

Since January 2017 she’s been president of the Women’s Sports Foundation, which ensures women’s access to sports programs. We asked her about how she gets her work done. Location: Salt Lake City, UT Current Gig: Pro Skier and President of the Women’s Sports Foundation One word that best describes how you work: Skiing Current mobile device: iPhone Current computer: Google Chromebook First of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today. I started skiing at the age of two because both my parents skied and hoped our family would enjoy skiing and playing outside together. At an early age I was always one of the last people on the mountain after the lifts had closed and I never minded skiing alone, I just loved to ski. I started ski racing when I was ten, then moved onto freeskiing when I was 16 and I turned pro around that same time, I won the US Open when I was 17 and became the first female freeskier to win the X Games at 18. Filming ski videos and making edits has always been important to me because that’s what I saw my female idols doing when I was growing up dreaming about becoming a pro skier. Take us through a recent workday. Wake up, eat a good breakfast, and stretch before heading to my local mountain Solitude Resort and catch one of the first chairs with a photographer. We end up shooting in the resort around the mountain as much as we can until the fresh snow is gone, then we part ways and I go home to switch with my husband so he can ride a bit too and I take care of our son for the rest of the day.

 While some cars were trapped in the latter avalanche, there were no reports of injuries in either incident.

 The video shows Easton's father pulling over and then backing up as the white wall of snow comes coursing down the mountain.

Italian media report that Cervinia, in the Aosta Valley, is half-buried under 2m (6.6ft) of fresh snow. About 10,000 tourists are stuck there. A similar emergency has gripped Adelboden, where the army was mobilised to clear debris from a landslide. In many resorts the avalanche risk is at level four, out of five in total.

Chidike Samuelson,"Two years ago, a Facebook prank made me stop underestimating the power of the social media. I had read a lot about the Social media's marketing power at the time, but I still took it for granted and certainly didn't exploit it as an entrepreneur, not to its fullest anyway. A friend had tagged me under the comments in an update on Facebook, and she had said, ""Chidike I didn't know you had a twin"". The post was the pre-wedding shoot of a couple; the man bore a distinct resemblance to me, though I didn't agree at the time. I and my elder had got into an argument as to whether or not the man in the picture resembled me enough to be mistaken for me. So as a test, I posted the picture on my Facebook timeline, but I wasn't prepared for the response I got, especially because everybody around me and everybody that knew me hadn't even gotten a suggestion from me that I was getting married The biggest lesson I learned that day was that social media wasn't just making the world smaller, Social media is becoming the world as we know it. These personal Lessons will help you get just why it is important to do this just right. Related: 10 Proven Ways to Make Millions on Social Media 1. Engagement requires you to be engaging. I had a decent following on social media and a ton of friends and friends of friends, but I had no idea how many people actually saw my posts. We tend to rate the level of exposure our social media marketing efforts get by the number of conversions or at least, likes, comments and shares, but this experience taught me how inaccurate that assessment was. In about 10 minutes after I posted that photo it showed up in all of Whatsapp groups with congratulatory messages, sandwiched in between rebukes of neglect. I received about 15 personal chats and my mother even heard that I was getting married! I was so alarmed that I had to call my fiancee to tell her before she got a call from someone else. The post itself plus my subsequent disclaimer got a deluge of likes and comments. The lesson is simple -- the social media is very capable of exposing your efforts. The question is, are your efforts engaging enough to precipitate engagement from the silent majority? It was a ""eureka"" moment for me in my personal business and my consulting for other businesses. It matters how you say what you say, how it looks and what it sounds like. For instance, a captioned picture tends to do much more for you than a long product description in text format and an animated video with an amazing plot will do far better than a picture. Carefully crafted content from a professional copywriter will do way better than your boring mission statement. The impotence in social media marketing that many businesses suffer from is not an indictment on social media, it is an indictment on the originator of the marketing effort. If it is engaging enough, it will find engagement. Who doesn't like weddings? Related: 10 Proven Ways to Make Millions on Social Media 2. All you need to succeed is a dedicated online audience. I had already built a following that were curious about what I was going to post next, which was usually about a variety of things from business to faith. This is little wonder that when I did post something that many people had been waiting to hear it set off a social media bomb. This experience taught me that one of the precursors for maximum engagement and subsequent conversions of our marketing efforts was building a dedicated audience that is interested in what you have to say. Businesses make the mistake of making every single post about their product and new innovations in their business. Such efforts are boring to say the least especially to millennials who incidentally are the bulk of social media users. Social media followers are more likely to engage the marketing efforts of a business that has previously shared moving opinion pieces on the Trump administration's business initiatives, than one who is all about themselves. The reason is clear, this way they feel you are one of them, a personality ; which is what all businesses should aspire to be perceived as. Related: This Instagrammer With More Than 2 Million Followers Literally Cooks Her Content 3. Social media's herd mentality. After my post, I received a lot of friend requests. They usually had a lot to say about my post and how hilarious it was when I posted a funny disclaimer about an hour later. They were thrilled that I had everyone played. Most of them said, ""Well, I just came up against this post with hundreds of likes and a ton of comments and I decided to check it out"" Personally, I check out YouTube channels when I see the number of subscribers to it, and I watch YouTube videos when the number of views is impressive. This is the social-media herd mentality -- people naturally go where many people have gone. They will likely trust a product on this basis as well. This is why businesses have carved out a lucrative business selling instagram likes and followers. The concept of ''trending"" or going ""viral"" is as much a business term today as it is just social media speak. This may sound strange to many business owners, but the new rules of the game are simple -- you have to look serious to be taken seriously.

dispensaries.com,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. So much for concerns about a federal government crackdown. Much like the reaction by many public officials and consumers to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ rescinding the Cole memo, financial backers in the marijuana industry seem unconcerned. Certainly, they’ve been willing to pony up a boatload of dollars so far in 2018 to back marijuana-related ventures. How big a boatload? About $1.23 billion in just the first five weeks of the year, according to a report from Viridian Cannabis Deal Tracker, a service that monitors merger and acquisition deals and investment in the legal marijuana industry. That’s almost as much as the total amount of investment in the entire year of 2016, according to Benzinga, and a 600 percent increase over the $178 million raised in the first five weeks of 2017. Related: California Studies Viability of a Public Bank for Marijuana Businesses Seattle company leads the way. The report from Viridian comes on the heels of a recent announcement by Seattle-based Privateer Holdings on completion of a Series C funding round that raised $100 million for cannabis industry investment. The company plans to use the cash for acquisitions, funding new ventures and expanding existing brands into new markets. Privateer Holdings’ portfolio includes medical cannabis company Tilray, the “official Bob Marley cannabis brand” called Marley Natural, marijuana edibles company Goodship and marijuana information site Leafly. The company reports it has raised $200 million so far to fund cannabis ventures. As with many in the cannabis industry, their work is also a cause. In a statement made in a news release about the $100 million funding raised, the company’s three founders --0 Brendan Kennedy, Michael Blue and Christian Groh -- released a joint statement that said the “war on cannabis is wrong” and “has made criminals out of millions of peaceful citizens,” especially in the minority community. “But hope is in sight. Brick by brick, the Berlin Wall of cannabis prohibition is crumbling, and safer, saner and more sensible cannabis policies are taking hold,” the three said. Certainly, $1.23 billion will cause a few more bricks to fall. Related: Despite Being Illegal Under Federal Law, Cannabis Has Grown Into a $9 Billion Industry In States Where It Is Legal. Impressive data Viridian Capital President Scott Greiper spoke with Benzinga about data in the new report. There were 65 capital raises in the first five weeks of 2018, with an average size of about $19 million. Nine of them raised more than $50 million. The majority of the investments went to cultivation and retail operations. It’s happening in Canada, as well. Last year, companies anticipating the nationwide legalization of cannabis raised $2 billion. The country expects to make recreational marijuana legal this summer. “While the medical market is expected to continue to grow over the next several years, the size of the coming adult-use market is expected to far exceed that of the medical side,” Viridian vice president Harrison Phillips told the Financial Post.

Jason Bell,"Paul Maurice won't mess with success tonight as he utilizes the same Winnipeg Jets lineup that has produced two consecutive NHL victories.
The Jets head coach has pencilled in goalie Connor Hellebuyck to start against the floundering Colorado Avalanche at Bell MTS Place. Game time is 7 p.m.
Defenceman Dmitry Kulikov (upper body) and forward Nic Petan will be spectators.
The Jets are coming off victories over the Buffalo Sabres and New York Rangers. Winnipeg (36-18-3) leads the Central Division — four points ahead of the Nashville Predators with two games in hand — and is tied with the San Jose Sharks atop the Western Conference
The Jets have a point in each of their past nine games at home (8-0-1).
The Avs, who shared the lead in the Central as recently as the first week of December, haven't won in their last eight games (0-5-3) and have fallen four points below the playoff line. They got thumped 5-2 by the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday and lost three straight times in overtime before that.
""They've got world-class players there. They've got lots of frustration and yet they're right there,"" cautioned Maurice. ""So, all it's going to take is one period, of one game and they catch fire and the pressure comes off and now you've got a problem. This is a really good team.""
Defenceman Tyler Myers said taking Colorado lightly would be a big mistake.
""It’s just like any other game at this time of year. We know they’re going to come in hard. (They’re) going through a tough stretch right now so we know they’re going to be a desperate hockey team. We need to make sure we’re up to our level and playing with a little bit of consistency,"" he said.
Winnipeg wraps up a three-game homestand Saturday when the Ottawa Senators visit.
The NHL trade deadline is Monday, Feb. 25 and there's been plenty of speculation the Jets are keenly interested in a couple of Senators forwards, most notably Matt Duchene and Mark Stone, a Winnipegger.
Tonight, Ottawa general manager Pierre Dorion, assistant-GM Peter MacTavish and chief scout Jim Clark are on the list to attend Bell MTS Place tonight.
The expectation is they'll stick around town to see the Manitoba Moose play the Chicago Wolves on Friday, with the Jets and Sens battling the next night.

Kristen Shilton,"TORONTO In the aftermath of the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-3 loss to the Colorado Avalanche on Monday, the refrains from players to coach were eerily familiar: the Leafs didnt work hard enough, didnt execute, and failed to win enough battles while making too many costly mistakes.
With only two wins in their last seven games, the Maple Leafs can readily identify the issues at hand. Now theyre tasked with trying to fix them.
We only have ourselves to blame, said Mike Babcock. Myself as the head coach, Im responsible. We didnt play well enough, we didnt play hard enough. And for the players its the same way. We werent good enough. Since Christmas we havent found that [next] level. I dont know why.
The loss presented shades of the same story the Leafs have been writing for weeks, where theyre being outworked and outplayed by heavy, hard-nosed, opportunistic hockey teams. The Avalanche, a club reeling from nine losses in their last 10 games before Mondays game, is the latest playoff-positioned team to down the Leafs, who have just one win in their last eight games against such opponents.
And as in those other defeats, Mondays was dotted by lost puck battles that turned into goals against the Leafs, and their previously dominating offence is still looking for a missing spark as they lost the possession battle at 38 per cent.
I dont think we played a good game tonight at all, said Mitch Marner, who scored one of the Leafs three goals. We didnt come ready to work; they did. They came ready to play us and we didnt do the same.
Things started well enough for the Leafs, when they jumped out to a 2-0 lead early in the second period off goals scored 1:14 apart by Igor Ozhiganov and Kasperi Kapanen. That busted a seven-game goalless drought for Kapanen, and came just 11 seconds after Par Lindholms goal had been called back upon a successful offside review by the Avalanche.
Rather than emboldening the Leafs to keep pressing through, the advantage put them on their heels. And Colorado was only too happy to capitalize.  
Colorados comeback started with its top line, made up of Gabriel Landeskog, Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen, who entered the game having combined for 185 points. Landeskog got on the board first, fighting for position in front of the newly returned Frederik Andersen and deflecting a puck low past the netminder.
Then, in the midst of some terrible puck management by the Leafs in the defensive zone, Rantanen executed a great solo effort to pick Nazem Kadris pocket and blast the game-tying goal past Andersen midway through the second.
It was John Tavares line with Marner and Zach Hyman who were matched up against MacKinnons group, but the Avalanche got the better of them winning races and applying pressure with 65 per cent possession, while Marner finished at minus-3 and Tavares at minus-4.
They were getting the pucks in, they were getting them back, they were moving a lot, said Marner. We didnt stop them, we didnt get any puck pressure. Thats something were going to have to fix.
Before the frame was over, Toronto trailed 3-2, on yet another poor defensive effort. While Toronto was on the power play, Jake Gardiner got completely outmuscled for a puck by Carl Soderberg who then beat Andersen shorthanded.
Gardiner was benched for the remaining 5:31 of the second period, and boos rained down from a faction of the Toronto crowd in period three whenever he touched the puck.
Tried to get body position, got it, whiffed on the puck and he got body position again, explained an emotional Gardiner post-game. [Boos] havent happened before, thats for sure. Not something you want to hear, but plays happen in the game.
Trailing in the third, Marner streaked in along the boards and roofed a puck top-shelf on Semyon Varlamov to tie things up, 3-3. But while that got the Leafs motor running, Soderberg scored again, and an early pull of Andersen led to two empty-netters, including Soderbergs hat trick score.  
Not mentally sharp, not physically engaged enough either, Babcock assessed. We havent been good enough. You get what you get. The league is going by and everyone is getting better and weve hit a lull, so we have to get it turned.
With the league-leading Tampa Bay Lightning waiting for Toronto on Thursday, there is precious little time for the Leafs to find a stronger layer to their game they feel is there, even as the losses keep piling up.
I dont think weve been as consistent as wed like to be the last few games. Tonight, we werent consistent at all, said Tavares. We just didnt win enough battles. We have to be desperate, we have a lot to play for. We can be a lot better than we were.
TAKEAWAYS
Gardiner in hot water
Its been a rough stretch for Gardiner of late, even before he misplayed Soderberg on the shorthanded goal. His turnover directly led to a key goal for the Boston Bruins in Saturday's loss, and he finished that game minus-2, facts likely fresh in Babcocks mind when he benched Gardiner for the rest of the second after his latest blunder.
If that message from Babcock wasnt clear enough, fans audibly booing Gardiner in frustration got it across. Gardiner draws more ire than other Leafs defenders in part because of how he plays, intermittently high-octane and dazzling to watch, but too often caught defensively like he has been the last two games. Monday included, Gardiner is minus-1 in his last six games, finishing Monday even in 18:07 of ice time (well below his season average of 21:36) with a game-worst 22 per cent possession. 
Still, its exceedingly rare for a skater to be singled out by the crowd for a bad error, and Gardiners teammates came to his defence immediately after the display. In shades of his Game 7 post-game press conference after last Aprils first-round playoff exit in Boston, Gardiner was clearly distraught by the reception he received. But Babcock conceded Gardiner has to play better, and the defenceman wholeheartedly agreed theres plenty that has to be improved going forward. 
Andersen back in action
It had been a long two weeks for Andersen battling his groin injury, and the netminder was eager to get back in the net and start feeling the puck again. His teammates gave Andersen plenty of chances for that, being outshot 31-13 through the first 40 minutes of the game while he did what he could to mask their various defensive breakdowns.
Colorado had good early pressure in the first, challenging Andersen from in tight, but the goalie was immediately tracking the puck well through bodies.
The second period proved especially tough for the Leafs, Andersen included, when he ceded three goals in just under eight minutes. There were positive plays too, like the wild, scrambling save from his stomach that had a rain of Fred-ie chants coming down from Torontos faithful. There was also the save on MacKinnons partial breakaway chance that briefly preserved the Leafs 2-1 lead.
As Babcock noted, though, Andersens return wasnt treated by his teammates as the boost it was, and Andersen thinks his reads will improve rapidly as he gets into more game action. He finished with 32 saves for an .889 save percentage.
Slow starts pile up
Its become routine lately for the Leafs to overcome themselves in the first five to seven minutes of a game, where simple mistakes cost them early momentum. Monday was another example of that phenomenon, with Colorado outshooting Toronto 4-1 in the first five minutes and hemming Toronto in its own end with 80 per cent possession.
While the Leafs did get rolling as the period went along, the Avalanche stayed on top of them for the duration, outshooting their hosts 13-5 after 20 minutes with 64 per cent possession. Neither side registered a goal in the opening frame, a fortunate break for the Leafs, but after repeatedly identifying the importance of better starts lately, Toronto proved on Monday that adjustments in that respect, like several others, are still a work in progress.
Blue and White Trending

Luke Fox,"TORONTO Some themes are developing, and they arent pretty.
As the Toronto Maple Leafs are left, on their day off, to stew in Mondays 6-3 demolishing by the ice-cold Colorado Avalanche, that hard stare in the mirror should make them realize that things cannot continue this way.
We’ve only got ourselves to blame, coach Mike Babcock said. Myself as the head coach, I’m responsible. We didn’t play well enough, we didn’t play hard enough, and the players are the same way. We weren’t good enough.
Bingo. But why?
Not having a healthy No. 1 goalie for three weeks is the obvious obstacle, and well save you another rant about finding a stud defenceman to patrol the right side, but the fissures run deeper.
The Leafs arent built for big-boy hockey
Diligent solo efforts by a couple of sturdy Colorado power forwards, Mikko Rantanen and Carl Soderberg, allowed them to strip pucks off Leafs (Nazem Kadri and Jake Gardiner, respectively) in their own zone and score back-breaking goals.
We have to bear down more, be harder to play against, Morgan Rielly said. Its important that we realize that.
The Leafs were outhit by Colorado 25-13 Monday, and were certain that stat would be even more lopsided if the Avs didnt have the puck all night.
Can Toronto flip a switch and play the heavy brand of hockey believed necessary to survive the post-season?
I think we can play heavy. Heavy is a mindset. I dont think you necessarily have to have massive guys. You can still play heavy. We have a lot of guys who can. I think everybody can do that — play on the cycle and do things you need to do to win, argues Zach Hyman, arguably the best example the Leafs own for heavy hockey.
You just have to have the mindset that youre not going to be pushed off the puck. Be strong on it. Brace yourself. Spin off guys. Just be tenacious. Its a tenacious mindset. I dunno. Its a nature-versus-nurture type of thing. I just grew up that way. My parents told me to go give 100 per cent when I was out there. For me, thats going into the corners. A mindset.
The Leafs have been lousy at home lately
Not since they purposely tanked to get as many balls as possible for the Auston Matthews lottery have the Maple Leafs endured a home stretch this dismal.
During their run to a franchise-best 29 home wins in 2017-18, Babcock delivered a great little speech about the importance of ruling your own barn and how he wanted visiting clubs to be worrying about how difficult it would be to scrape two points as they ate dinner the night prior to a date in Toronto.
Thats not happening.
The Leafs have now lost five of six at Scotiabank Arena by a combined score of 21-13. In two of those five losses, they got shut out. In the other three, they had the lead and fumbled it.
Their lone home win this month came against an exhausted Canucks team wrapping its third six-game road trip of the season without its best player in the lineup (Elias Pettersson).
The Maple Leafs havent defeated any team currently in a playoff position at home since November.
Such sloppiness — mental gaffes that lead to goals, questionable efforts, declining special teams is especially confounding in games Toronto should gear up for.
They were booed off the ice when Mathew Barzals Islanders rolled through and shut them out in John Tavaress first game against his former team. And Gardiner bore the brunt of fans frustration Monday, fielding flurries of boos both online and in real life, when Toronto shouldve been emboldened with the return of Frederik Andersen.
That hasnt happened before, thats for sure, an emotional Gardiner said. Not something you want to hear, but plays happen in the game. Fans are passionate and they want to win.
The natives are restless.
I have been a Leafs fan my whole life. I often hear, we have the best fans in the world. Not a chance. First of all, we have the quietest rink in the league. Now we are booing our players. Best fans in the world are loud at home games. And they dont boo players on a whim.
— Gerry Dee (@gerrydee) January 15, 2019
Is complacency becoming an issue?
Its reasonable to peek at the NHL standings and wonder if a sense of complacency may be seeping into the room. The Maple Leafs hold a three-point lead (plus two games in hand) over Montreal for a spot in the Atlantic Divisions 2-3 matchup, but trail the force of nature that is the Tampa Bay Lightning by a nearly insurmountable 14 points for the top seeding. 
Crazier things have happened, but another first-round showdown versus the Boston Bruins feels almost inevitable, to the point where its already being discussed openly 37 games out.
Why not battle to ensure the second seed and home ice? Thats certainly something worth battling for Game 7s at TD Garden have not exactly brought out Torontos good side except these Leafs have been a decidedly better, looser and more determined group on the road this season (15-5-1) than at home (13-10-1).
The Leafs have drawn opponents more desperate for points than them, and it has showed.
Its time now to put up or shut up, Avalanche coach Jared Bednar proclaimed prior to Mondays tilt. His players had dropped nine of 10 and yet was firmly in the playoff mix, thanks to the Central Divisions mushy middle.
Rielly has copped to the Leafs letting their foot off the pedal for costly stretches. Truth is, as the third-best team in the East, the Leafs can put up now, or coast for a bit and then put up.
We didnt come ready to work. They did, Mitch Marner admitted post-game. They were on a little bit of a slide down, and they came ready to play us. We didnt do the same.
So many slumping forwards
The frustration of scoring but one goal and two assists in 16 games is eating at William Nylander, and it shows. Following another near-miss Monday and during another minus outing Nylander whacked his stick on the glass in anger.
Yes, theres more jump in his legs than a month ago, but the invisible monkey he threw off his back on Jan. 3 may have hid a baby in his hood.
Patrick Marleau has now gone nine games without a goal. Its been 10 since hes finished on the plus side of the ledger.
Nazem Kadri has scored once in his past 18 and, after back-to-back 32-goal campaigns, is tracking for only 17.
Auston Matthews is contributing assists, but even he is stuck in his worst goal dip of the season, finding the net once in 10 games. 
When you go down and things don’t go right, you’ve got to dig in and you’ve got to find a way out of it in a hurry, Babcock said.
That’s a sense of urgency. That’s also being loose and driving and playing right.
Toronto is still searching for its go-to matchup line
John Tavaress line with Marner and Zach Hyman is the coachs most trusted, so Babcock hard-matched them against Boston and Colorado.
But Nathan MacKinnons all-star trio absolutely caved in the Leafs, dominating zone time and scoring opportunities in the best-on-best.
Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy has said he actually wants his best line, Marchand-Bergeron-Pastrnak, to go head-to-head with Tavares.
On other nights, Auston Matthews group has been given that shutdown role.
And Kadri relished the challenge over the past two seasons, memorably getting under the skin of superstars like Joe Thornton and Connor McDavid; he looks significantly less engaged facing his fellow 3Cs with a constantly rotating cast of wingmen.
What I’d like to do is I’d like to be able to give all three of those groups matchups as time goes on, Babcock says. But? We’ve got to be playing good enough.
As Toronto exhales Tuesday and looks ahead to its next challenge, Thursdays doozy in Tampa, there is a silver lining: They can be better than this. Much better.
We can compete way harder than we are right now. For whatever reason, since Christmas we haven’t found that level. I don’t know why that is, Babcock said.
The league is going by, and everyone is getting better, and we’ve hit a lull. We’ve got to get turned.",Five reasons Maple Leafs should be concerned following loss to Avalanche Sportsnet.ca Avalanche hand sloppy Maple Leafs another home loss TSN Maple Leafs come to Jake Gardiner’s defence after boo birds emerge Sportsnet.ca Leafs present Andersen with poor effo…,2019-01-15T14:03:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sportsnet.ca'}",Five reasons Maple Leafs should be concerned following loss to Avalanche - Sportsnet.ca,https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/five-reasons-maple-leafs-concerned-following-loss-avalanche/,https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20390922.jpg,,Sportsnet.ca,avalanche,1
Sam Rutherford,"Originally slated for a December release, it seems we’re going to be waiting a little longer for Apple’s $350 HomePod smart speaker now that its debut has been delayed until sometime in “early 2018.” In a statement Apple made to The Verge, the company said “We can’t wait for people to experience HomePod, Apple’s breakthrough wireless speaker for the home, but we need a little more time before it’s ready for our customers,” before concluding with “We’ll start shipping in the US, UK and Australia in early 2018.” This could be a huge blow for Apple after a fall that has seen the release of Sonos’ first smart speaker, Google’s more affordable Home Mini, and a an avalanche of new Alexa-powered products, including the newly revamped Echo. And that’s not counting all the other speaker companies trying to shoehorn digital assistants into their gadgets. Based on the vague wording in Apple’s official statement, its difficult to glean what exactly is causing the delay, but it must be serious because missing the entire holiday shopping season is sure to have a impact on sales. Our best guess is that it has something to do with voice recognition or Siri integration, as Apple already gave press a preview of what the HomePod sounded like during WWDC in June.

Karima Mariama-Arthur,"We usually think of information as an attractive resource -- an asset that curates opportunity and enriches our understanding of the world around us. In business, acquiring new information can be exciting: Business leaders use it to become smarter, more agile and to make better decisions. Think, for example, about the benefits of leveraging insights from newly minted market trends and technological advances to achieve a competitive advantage. Information can illuminate the path to success and in some cases, pave it completely. Related : Tai Lopez's 4 Ways to Consume Information Like a Billionaire However, when otherwise “useful information” is perceived as painful, contrary to our tightly held beliefs, or requiring unwanted action, it can instantly become less attractive, and morph into an unwanted resource that is shunned. This phenomenon is known as “information avoidance” and defined as “any behavior designed to prevent or delay the acquisition of available but potentially unwanted information,” according to an article by the American Psychological Association. If you find yourself waging a poignant tug-of-war with information avoidance, consider the following strategies as you work to confront it. Become a lifelong learner consuming new information daily. According to an estimate based on UNESCO statistics, approximately 171,000 books were published worldwide in the first 24 days of 2018, which means that humanity is on pace to publish about 2.6 million new titles this year. If you were to read one book a day for the entire year -- no small feat -- you will have consumed only 0.014 percent of that published information. And when you add in all the news, journal and magazine articles; the radio, television and internet news stories; the email newsletters, blogs and social media posts -- the amount of material produced every day boggles the mind. Here’s how to leverage these infinite resources and cut through the noise: Reach for fresh, pertinent information on a daily basis. However, not just any information. Make sure that what you consume specifically advances your understanding of your industry and adds value to your work. Relevant information is powerful, and if you’re acquiring it both regularly and strategically, you’ll have a competitive advantage. To be sure, lifelong learning also addresses the myth that terminal degrees, certifications and other finite learning experiences serve as the “be-all and end-all” for long-term business success. While it's good to know what everyone else knows, it’s far better to carve out a compelling niche that creates continuous, unmatched value in your thought leadership. Related: Why You Should Strive to Be a Lifelong Learner Seek constructive criticism from mentors without becoming defensive. Pretending to “know it all” just because you have an above-average understanding of something can be dangerous. The truth is that no matter how brilliant you may be, what you know fills your head while what you don’t know fills the universe. One of the ways that we justify information avoidance is by convincing ourselves that we know everything worth knowing about a subject. Don’t fool yourself. No matter how well-informed you may be, there is always an opportunity to learn more and correct erroneous thinking. That said, put your ego aside and challenge yourself to deal with information that does not reinforce your own opinions, such as feedback from a trusted advisor. Too often we put ourselves into “information bubbles” populated by people who think exactly as we think, and we ignore voices from those who operate outside our bubbles. We discount science that doesn’t comport with our worldview. We shun facts that might compel us to change our minds. And we do so because we don’t like admitting that we might be wrong. You can easily avoid this conundrum by seeking the advice of individuals whom you trust and who will give you honest and valuable feedback. It takes courage, humility and hard work to embrace constructive criticism. However, if you’re eager for a deeper understanding of yourself, your profession, and the world around you, remember that feedback from a trusted advisor can only enhance your perspectives and indeed, your overall performance, which is exactly the point. Related : 6 Tips For hearing Constructive Feedback Act on new information with a sense of urgency. Even when you decide to accept information and use it to your advantage, you must still, nevertheless, act on it. Make the call. Send the report. Schedule the meeting. Change the policy. Do whatever it takes and refuse to dillydally. The longer you reside in your head, the greater likelihood of you being lulled into inaction. Sometimes time is of the essence and undue delays can result in disaster. It’s one thing to skip an article about a celebrity whose politics you can’t stomach; it’s another thing altogether to ignore a CBO report that details the deadly consequences of a new law that will have an immediate, chilling effect on your industry. Avoiding certain information and the required follow-up, means that real people may suffer. Don’t shirk your responsibility by dragging your feet simply because you’re afraid of change. A useful concept to remember when you start to capitulate is to “Eat the Frog.” When used in business, it means to deal with the most challenging task first. It helps to build momentum and creates a strong sense of accomplishment in the early phases of a task's lifecycle. Once you discover useful information and understand how to apply it, simply step forward and execute. The more you become familiar with this process, the greater your capacity to take the necessary action without equivocation. Moreover, acting with a sense of urgency conveys valuable benefits to all stakeholders. Related : Don't Lose That all-Important Sense of Urgency. Do It--Now!

Chatbots and virtual assistants have gone through an evolution — or a revolution, says Ryan Lester, director of customer engagement technologies at LogMeIn. The strength of a virtual assistant or bot initially was general knowledge management, but companies have pushed that experience, moving into more personalized experiences where instead of a generic answer, a bot or assistant will offer personalized content. Now we’re transitioning to a transactional phase, where these tools can actually attack and accomplish a task like fulfilling an order. And companies far down the maturity model with chatbots and virtual assistants have seen some really positive results. “When companies have a chatbot, theyre seeing much higher conversion rates,” Lester says. “As high as 300 percent, and in some cases theyre much higher. And the reason theyre higher is because the chatbot experience is more personalized. It’s much more aligned to where the customer is in their journey. And chatbots are available 24/7.” But it comes down to the use case, he says, and doing the up-front work of making sure the bot is contextual, understands what the customer is trying to accomplish, and is there to give them an immediate outcome. The power of chatbots is that they go beyond a single channel, Lester says. Its not as if they only work for email or for a messaging platform — this technology can work across every channel, offering the same high-quality experience with a voice assistant as in the mobile app. “It’s really impactful because youre learning from all of these different channels, and those insights will make every channel better,” he says. “The power of AI is in this crowdsourcing of information. The bot learns from every customer interaction, which in turn can help you deliver better customer outcomes.” Companies across industries — financial services, travel and hospitality, service providers in telco like Vodafone — are leveraging AI to deliver much more consistent experiences across their channels of engagement, he adds, offering the example of one of the top three banks in India, which offers an AI-powered assistant across all their channels. With that omnichannel assistant, they’re able to take all the information about a customer’s accounts, including information about past purchases or balances, and make that readily accessible anywhere, anytime. If a customer has a question about a transaction, or receives a mobile app notification about possible fraud, they don’t have to click through — they can talk to Alexa to dig into the issue and even resolve the problem. Being able to reap data across channels is also incredibly valuable for a company, allowing it to tap into powerful strategies like predictive analytics. Based on this specific customer and their balance, or the services they have, or their age, the bot can identify a new service that can be of value to them, or make proactive outreach for offers or promotions relevant to their current journey, all based on the data signals the company has gathered through all of the customer’s previous interactions. “That cross-sell potential is very powerful with bots, because once again, they have all that rich contextual information about the user,” Lester says. Chatbots can be additive, as well, augmenting the rich information in a marketing tool or an ERP system, and work in real time. A bot can identify a customer type, belonging to a specific cohort, appearing on the website, and then bring that information to a marketing automation tool, which then surfaces an offer to promote at the right time and in the right place. Some companies have even eliminated email as a channel, in light of the bot advantage, Lester says. “We think that some channels will continue to shrink over time,” he says. “The bot is pervasive and the bot delivers a much better experience. You dont send an email and have to wait with a bot.

Matt Simon,"You can’t see the bunny, but the picosecond laser certainly can. In a lab at Stanford, engineers have set up a weird contraption, hiding a toy bunny behind a T-shaped wall. And their complex system of computation and rapidly firing lasers can see around that corner. So, too, could the self-driving cars of the future. At least that’s the idea behind this technique, which uses the flight paths of the photons in lasers to calculate the shape and position of hidden objects—be they bunnies or passing pedestrians. It’s not an entirely new idea. This system deploys the same very, very precise timing that drives the laser-spewing lidar on a self-driving car. Lidar builds a 3-D map of an environment by calculating how long it takes for all those photons to bounce off objects and make it back to the device, helping a car find its way. This is just that, but like, way harder. The experiment's setup, showing the laser firing off the wall to expose the hidden rabbit. If you’re having a tough time imagining how a laser can “see” around a wall, allow me to clarify. Picture two bits of wall that intersect in a T-shape. Now pull them apart from each other a little bit. Stick a toy bunny behind the “leg” of the T. If you were to stand on the other side of the leg (now you can’t see the bunny) you could still bean the little rascal by throwing a ball against the other wall. It would deflect off the wall at an angle and pass through that gap you just made, knocking Fluffy over. Now replace that ball with a picosecond laser firing millions of pulses of light a second. The light bounces off the wall at an angle, hits the rabbit behind a screen, bounces back at the wall, and right back at you—leaving laser traces that algorithms can turn into a 3-D image of the bunny. Some challenges, though: Once the laser has bounced from the wall to the rabbit to the wall to the (whew!) sensor, the researchers are left with an extremely faint traces of light. That’s why they needed a so-called single photon avalanche diode, or SPAD, to make the most of that tiny signal. “Think about a house of cards,” says Gordon Wetzstein, an electrical engineer at Stanford. “You can't detect a single photon by itself, it's very small. But as soon as that photon hits that particular SPAD, it's like pulling out one card in the bottom of a house of cards, and everything falls apart.” Just a single photon has the potential to trigger an “avalanche” of current in the sensor, explains Stanford electrical engineer David Lindell. And it’s this voltage peak that lets the engineers know when the photons have returned. In this demonstration, the group fired their laser for either 7 or 70 minutes, depending on how reflective the object was, while the SPAD monitored those laser returns. That explains how they collect their data—but not how they turn it into a 3-D visualization of the hidden object. To understand what’s sitting behind that wall, the researchers need to understand all the potential paths of that glancing laser. So they also have to scan the geometry of the wall. “With the understanding of where the wall is, you can perform this reconstruction to get the 3-D geometry of the hidden object,” Lindell says. Once that data comes in—the wall scan and the 7 or 70 minutes of SPAD returns—the algorithms get to work cutting out the noise, things like ambient light in the room. Seeing around corners in the lab. To crunch all the data, previous systems have used uber-powerful hardware and a whole lot of time. But using this new configuration, published Monday in the journal Nature, engineers can do it on a laptop almost instantly. “You can push a button on your laptop and process these images in a second,” says Lindell, “whereas before it took hours on compute-intensive hardware to be able to do this.” That was due in part to the way the system is set up. In previous approaches using lasers to see around corners, the laser and light detector weren’t pointed at the same location, making the systems “non-confocal.” “Using a confocal approach is an unexpected new idea and simplifies the demands on algorithms to see around the corner,” says MIT’s Achuta Kadambi, who works in computational imaging. Because just about everyone working on self-driving cars already relies on lasers, it’s reasonable to think they could incorporate corner-peeking tech in the future. Challenges remain, though: Researchers will have to increase the power of the lasers to work in daylight without burning pedestrians’ eyes out. Out in the real world, photons will be bouncing off all kinds of surfaces far more irregular than a wall in a lab. Plus, you can’t exactly wait around for minutes at a time to see if there’s a pedestrian behind that truck over there. ""The biggest challenge is the amount of signal lost when light bounces around multiple times,"" says Stanford's Matthew O'Toole, lead author on the paper. ""This problem is compounded by the fact that a moving car would need to measure this signal under bright sunlight, at fast rates, and from long range."" Still, this tech could have a bright (sorry) future beyond self-driving cars. Robots that already roll around the corridors of hospitals and hotels would do well to detect people coming around corners. It could even find use in medical devices like endoscopes. Or just looking for bunnies around corners. Paging Elmer Fudd. Pew Pew Lasers, of course, are fundamental to all self-driving car technology: Lidar is behind the systems that both Uber and Alphabet's Waymo are developing. It's also the technology that the two tech goliaths were fighting over in their recently-settled court case. Every car company, in some way, is trying to get a slice of the lidar pie.",A clever system uses lasers and algorithms to map out-of-sight objects in 3-D.

Nathan Grayson,"As part of today’s E3 press event, Bethesda revealed footage of Avalanche-developed post-apocalpytic shooter sequel, Rage 2. The demo was preceded by a full-blown goddamn Andrew W.K. concert, which absolutely rocked and was completely wasted on an audience full of already-tired E3 attendees. I mean, look at this: Amazing! The actual game was cool, too. It began with a montage of car chases and a very angry man yelling about how he’s the last of his kind and “there’s only one thing left to do.” Then it shifted into a mission. The player immediately grabbed a car—if you can see it, you can steal it, apparently—and began blowing up other cars with all manner of artillery. They made it to a space center, which was being vandalized by a bunch of mohawked bandits. The player proceeded to zip around on foot and positively obliterate them with a hail of gunfire and grenades. Then the focus briefly shifted to a wacky TV commercial one of the bandits was watching before returning to fast-paced bandit gibbing. The shotgun produced especially gruesome results, leaving people in meaty piles that’d make Doom demons blush. The person piloting the demo also employed grenades that appeared to have gravity altering properties, one of which catapulted him into the air, allowing him to crash down on a bandit. The demo ended with the player being ambushed by a massive football-player-looking mutant, at which point the player went into some kind of rage-induced super mode. It looks kinda like Avalanche’s Mad Max game from a few years ago, but ten times wackier and with a way bigger budget.

Amanda Lee Myers / AP,"(LOS ANGELES) — Heather Turping was snowboarding with her boyfriend when she heard someone scream “Avalanche!” Then Turping, 39, saw “a cloud of snow coming down.” The avalanche that hit Friday at the Squaw Valley Ski Resort caught five people — one day after a snowboarder died there during a blizzard as a winter storm rolled through California. The storm that steamrollered through the Sierra Nevada still threatened rain and snow through Saturday afternoon in Southern California, a few hundred miles away. The National Weather Service said mountains in Ventura and Los Angeles counties could see up to a foot of new snow at higher elevations. Other areas could see some showers before an eastward-moving low-pressure trough moved on but forecasters said it wouldn’t be enough to cause major flooding. That was a relief to residents of the coastal foothill town of Montecito, northwest of Los Angeles. The Santa Barbara County town was ravaged by mudslide in January that killed 21 people and inundated hundreds of homes. Evacuation orders affecting up to 30,000 people on the south Santa Barbara County coast were issued Wednesday but lifted Friday after the worst of the rain passed without significant damage. “We have come through this with minimal impact,” said Rob Lewin, director of the county Office of Emergency management. The Sierra Nevada avalanche Friday afternoon injured two people, one seriously. Three others escaped without being hurt. Heather Turping saw the massive avalanche passed only a foot in front of her. A woman screamed that her husband was missing and someone spotted a snowboard poking out of the snow. “That’s what saved his life,” Turping said. “I took my gloves off and I helped dig him out,” she said. “When he got uncovered, a ski patroller said, ‘You were under for six minutes.'” The man wasn’t seriously hurt and was able to snowboard back down the mountain, she said. The skiers and snowboarders were within areas open to skiing at the time and the guests had been warned of the potential danger, Squaw Valley spokeswoman Liesl Hepburn said. The resort used explosives and other tools to knock down snow to prevent avalanches throughout the day but the snowfall was heavy, she said. “We had assessed the area to be safe to open to the public and unfortunately an avalanche did occur after that assessment was made,” Hepburn said. The avalanche occurred hours after the body of a missing snowboarder was found at the same resort. Wenyu Zhang, 42, vanished Thursday as the region was hit by a blizzard packing winds gusting to nearly 150 mph (241 kph) over the ridge tops. It dumped 3 feet (1 meter) of snow in the mountains. A blizzard warning expired Friday but whiteout conditions were still possible around Lake Tahoe, where a winter storm warning remained in effect until 10 a.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service said.",The avalanche hit one day after a snowboarder died during a blizzard,2018-03-03T14:33:18Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",‘Avalanche!’ Blizzard Leaves 1 Dead at California Ski Resort,http://time.com/5184080/california-avalanche-squaw-valley/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ski-resort-avalanche.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,avalanche,1
Dani Deahl,"Billy McFarland, the organizer behind disastrous music festival Fyre Fest, pleaded guilty today to two counts of wire fraud. In court, he told a judge he lied to investors and “grossly underestimated the resources that would be necessary to hold an event of this magnitude,” as reported by Bloomberg. On June 30th of last year, the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York arrested and charged McFarland with wire fraud, also alleging that he misrepresented his company’s finances in order to attract investors for the festival. Speaking to US District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan today, McFarland admitted he defrauded 80 investors and a ticket broker out of more than $26 million. “In an attempt to raise what I thought were needed funds,” he said, “I lied to investors about various aspects of Fyre Media and my personal finances.” McFarland pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and pleaded guilty to ripping off a ticketing vendor that spent $2 million to secure advance tickets for future iterations of Fyre Fest. Each count of wire fraud carries a maximum of 20 years in prison, but McFarland has struck a plea deal with the government which will reduce his sentence to eight to 10 years, with a fine of up to $300,000. McFarland will also pay restitution. Fyre Fest, which McFarland organized with Ja Rule, was originally billed as an exclusive festival that would be attended by celebrities and influencers in April of last year. When ticket holders arrived — some of whom had paid well over $10,000 for the experience — they found a haphazard setup and were stranded on the island of Exuma in what was called a “tent city.” It became a cautionary tale of why not to trust Instagram sponcon, nomenclature for describing a failed event, and spawned an avalanche of amazing memes. Currently McFarland is free on bail, and he will be sentenced on June 21st. Both he and his company Fyre Media are still facing over a dozen civil suits.","Organizer Billy McFarland told a judge he lied to investors and “grossly underestimated the resources that would be necessary to hold an event of this magnitude,”",2018-03-07T00:11:18Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Fyre Fest organizer pleads guilty to two counts of wire fraud,https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17088402/fyre-fest-organizer-pleads-guilty-to-two-counts-of-wire-fraud,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u_6Y8OIDWwerN1-zlRFwjkieFlQ=/0x12:800x431/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8784507/fyre_festival_0.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,avalanche,1

Chris Welch,"Add the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office to the growing list of government units around the world that are investigating Apple over the reduced performance of iPhones with older batteries inside. The company’s poor messaging about an iOS update intended to prevent unexpected shutdowns — a change that required throttling the processor and slowing performance of iPhones with chemically-aged batteries — led to widespread controversy and customer frustration late last year. As reported by Apple Insider, the new probe comes after Seol’s Citizens United for Consumer Sovereignty filed a complaint against Apple that claimed the company is really slowing down iPhones to sway consumers towards upgrading sooner than would otherwise be necessary. This accusation of deliberate deterioration is one that many people have turned to, though it doesn’t really hold up from a customer loyalty perspective. Apple has denied any kind of early-upgrade conspiracy, and last week CEO Tim Cook told ABC News “we deeply apologize for anyone who thinks we had some other kind of motivation.” The company also published an open letter on the matter on its website and reduced the battery replacement fee to $29.. But in that same ABC News interview, Cook touched on the problem that led to this avalanche of bad press and angry customers. “When we put it out, we did say what it was, but I don’t think a lot of people were paying attention. Maybe we should have been clearer as well.” I’d say the number of investigations into the matter and amount of blowback Apple has taken are enough to eliminate any “maybe.” (Apple is also facing probes in Italy and France.) With the release of iOS 10.2.1 in 2016, Apple indeed touched on reduced shutdowns and deeper battery management — but any update that eventually slows down a very expensive smartphone deserved a more up front, obvious explanation. Cook has said that an upcoming iOS update will offer more detailed battery health information and allow customers to disable the performance throttling. Doing so would leave the user experience unaffected but might increase the risk of annoying shutdowns when the battery still has a charge.",Apple faces more scrutiny for an update that slowed down iPhones with old batteries.,2018-01-21T21:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",South Korea prosecutors are investigating Apple’s iPhone battery controversy,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/21/16916448/south-korea-apple-slow-iphone-performance-battery-probe,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RgULXHCyXM6sV_OSeFClAr3ASVQ=/0x101:1400x834/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/5880137/iphone-6s-2-29.0.0.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,avalanche,1

Alex Lockie,"President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, had his nomination rocked by additional and graphic accusations of sexual misconduct over the weekend — and his future in the legal profession has come into question. Senate Democrats launched an investigation of a new allegation of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, according to a report in The New Yorker on Sunday. The accuser, Deborah Ramirez, recalled with some difficulty a night in the early 1980s when she claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and forced her into nonconsensual sexual contact short. On the same day, political activist and lawyer Michael Avenatti claimed to represent a woman who had information that Kavanaugh had tried in high school to use drugs and alcohol to facilitate the ""gang rape"" of women. These accusations land after Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University, already derailed Kavanaugh's nomination proceedings with a letter alleging sexual assault at a high school party. Ford, after some back and forth, agreed to testify at a public hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Kavanaugh has not responded publicly to Avenatti's claims, but has categorically denied any sexual misconduct in the past. ""This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,"" Kavanaugh said. ""The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name — and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building — against these last-minute allegations."" Kavanaugh now has to defend himself not against civil or criminal charges, but rather a preponderance of seemingly disqualifying information, and some of his fellow legal experts now expect his race is run. President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, answers a question about guns from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., during a third round of questioning on the third day of his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Thursday, Sept. 6, 2018, on Capitol Hill in Washington, to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. Jacquelyn Martin/AP Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of Harvard's Lawfare blog and someone who counts Kavanaugh as a personal friend, said as much in an article in The Atlantic. ""The standard for elevation to the nation's highest court is not that the nominee established a 'reasonable doubt' that the serious allegations against him were true,"" wrote Wittes. ""[E]ven if he truly believes himself innocent, even if he is innocent—the better part of valor is to get out now."" Beyond his ascension into the highest court in the US, questions have come up about Kavanaugh's current employment. Harvard Law students have campaigned at their university for an investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh or cancel a class he's slated to teach there in 2019. Additionally, any findings of misconduct could damage Kavanaugh's standing as a federal judge, his current job. Even short of findings of actual misconduct, if the controversy around Kavanaugh passes a tipping point he may find himself unable to carry out his normal duties in service of the court. Federal judges have resigned over such controversies in the recent past. Kavanaugh never had an easy shot at confirmation as his hearings came in the months before the 2018 Congressional midterm elections. Before any allegations of sexual misconduct, Kavanaugh already faced intense and personal scrutiny and outright opposition to the timing of his nomination. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee had misquoted him on social media and stood accused of grandstanding for future presidential runs by their Republican colleagues.","President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, had his nomination rocked by additional and graphic accusations of sexual misconduct over the weekend.

It shows a blow-by-blow timeline of events from “various perspectives,” plus relevant social media posts and links to in-depth coverage. “Users’ trust in the news we present is of the utmost importance to Bing,” the Bing team wrote, “and we’re committed to providing a well-rounded view of news from diverse, quality sources.” Above: A graphic illustrating the elements of Bing Spotlight. It’s available on Bing desktop and mobile web in the U.S. A spokesperson told VentureBeat via email that Bing Spotlight is an “evolving feature,” and that the team will evaluate options based on feedback. Bing Spotlight spots trending topics with the help of deep learning algorithms that ingest millions of search queries and news articles every day. Leaning on a web graph of “hundreds of millions” of websites, it factors in signals such as browser logs, the number of publishers covering a story, and how prominently each publisher featured their respective stories on their sites. Articles have to be “original, readable, newsworthy, and transparent” before they’re considered for a top spot, and must demonstrate “sound journalistic practices” such as identify sources and authors, giving attribution, and labeling opinion and commentary. “Being an informed consumer of the news is more challenging today than it used to be,” the team wrote. “Our goal is to provide broader context for impactful stories, from politics to business to major disasters, and much more.” Bing Spotlight comes roughly three months after Google unveiled a revamped Google News app for smartphones.

"Daniel Setiawan on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Huaraz, Peru –From a stone hut perched on the edge of the glacial lake Palcacocha, 14,980 feet above sea level, Juan Victor Morales radios down to a dispatcher in the city of Huaraz below. He is all that stands between the city and disaster. Today, it’s just a routine call, one the wind-chapped lookout makes every two hours during his fifteen day shift. Speaking into the handset of the CB radio, Morales reports the temperature, the amount of precipitation, and the level of the lake, then pauses to listen to the sound of a distant avalanche. “Don’t worry, that one is far away,” he says after the last echo of the avalanche’s rumble has faded out. He isn’t spooked: After all, there are avalanches here practically every day. Morales is one of two men tasked with standing sentinel over Lake Palcacocha, which sits high in the Cordillera Blanca mountains east of the 120,000-strong city of Huaraz. His job is to warn the residents of Huaraz in the event of a glacial lake outburst flood—a sudden breach in the lake’s natural dam, which could be caused by large chunks of glacial ice from an avalanche falling into the lake. The displacement of water would create a wave that some University of Texas models predict could be as tall as 100 feet. Such a wave would easily smash through the moraine dam, an accumulation of rocks and sediment that forms along a glacier’s edge. Billions of gallons of water would rush down the valley into the city of Huaraz some 12 miles (20 km) away and 3,200 feet (1,000 meters) below, destroying everything in its path. “We have to be ready for anything,” Morales says. “There could be a big avalanche or an earthquake, the moraine could fall, then there would be a big flood.” It’s a problem threatening not only Huarez, but mountainous communities around the world. As global warming continues unchecked, alpine glaciers from the Andes to the Alps are melting at record speeds, creating a host of challenges for the people that depend on them for water, energy, and food. Now, NGOs and government officials are scrambling to shore up Huarez’s defenses while some residents are taking on big energy companies directly—a strategy which could serve as a template for similarly-threatened communities around the world. Just before dawn on December 13th, 1941 an avalanche sent large blocks of ice into Lake Palcacocha, creating waves that crashed through the moraine dam. The water that rushed out of the ever-increasing rupture poured into another lake called Jircacocha located just over a mile below, also destroying its dam. The combined contents of the two lakes then rushed into the town of Huaraz, appearing to the sleepy residents as a 50 to 100-foot high wall of water and ice, mud, rock, trees, houses, livestock, and human bodies that crashed through the city with unrelenting force. Up to 5000 people died and nearly a third of the city was destroyed in the glacial lake outburst flood of 1941. Today, it’s hard to imagine that such a disaster took place. Fueled by tourism, Huaraz has grown into the second largest city in the central Peruvian Andes—its population has quadrupled since 1941. The streets bustle with hikers, climbers, and other adventure seeking tourists from around the world. A host of businesses cater to them, offering everything from knock-off North Face jackets to roasted Guinea pig. Meanwhile, unseen in the mountains to the east of the city, Lake Palcacocha has also grown. Today the volume of the lake is 34 times greater than it was in 1941, according to national authorities, a ticking time bomb of 4.5 billion gallons of water. Lake levels rose so high in 2011 that authorities declared a state of emergency and installed flexible tubes to siphon water out of the lake. This emergency measure succeeded in lowering the lake by 20 feet (six meters), but many glaciologists believe that’s not nearly enough. “The regular citizen of Huaraz does not think, oh we need to do something about this lake because I need to save my life. They don’t see the risk,” Jahir Anicama Diaz, the regional coordinator for CARE, an NGO working to implement an early defense warning system at Lake Palcacocha, tells me. On the walls of his office are maps of the city showing evacuation routes, the high risk neighborhoods painted in yellow, orange, and red. “We don’t only need to control the lake,” he says, “but also increase the resilience of the people.” After more than a decade of delay, the early defense warning system at Lake Palcacocha should be in place by the end of this year, but a reinforced dam is still years down the line. The $4 million dollar scheme to secure the lake has been slow moving, plagued by government corruption and bogged down by negotiations between competing interests, including national and regional governments, local communities, farmers, glaciologists, engineers, NGOs, and hydroelectric companies. “This is climate injustice.” Unable to just sit and watch from the sidelines, some, like local farmer and mountain guide Saul Luciano LLiuya, have taken matters into their own hands. In 2015, LLiuya sued Germany energy company RWE, one of the world’s largest producers of greenhouse gases. Although RWE has no presence in Peru, LLiuya argues that the energy giant has still played a major role in causing climate change and the loss of Peru’s glaciers. “What I want is for the companies that contribute to climate change to take responsibility,” says LLiuya, whose case is supported by the NGO Germanwatch. “Here we suffer the consequences for something that we are not responsible for. This is climate injustice.” After a district court in Essen, Germany dismissed LLiuya’s case in December 2015, a higher court in Hamm agreed to hear it, making it the first time a company will be tried for climate change-related charges in Europe. The case is largely symbolic. LLiuya is only asking $20,000 dollars from RWE—an amount proportionate to the.05 percent of global CO2 emissions that the company is purportedly responsible for. If he wins, the money would go to the national government to be used for the lake securitization project currently underway. Even if he doesn’t win, LLiuya is happy that the case has brought international attention to the immediate threat climate change is posing to vulnerable communities not just in Peru, but in countries around the world. “Every time I go up into the mountains, every year, I see the glaciers are less and less,” says Lliuya, who has been guiding tourists into the mountains for 17 years. “I felt I had an obligation to do something. We all do.” Scientists estimate that Andean glaciers have lost 1600 years of ice in the last 25 years alone, and in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru’s highest and most glaciated mountain range, glaciers have shrunk 35 percent in the past forty years, according to authorities. Beyond Huaraz, these glaciers supply water to the farms and cities in the desert lowlands. With that was supply today melting faster than it can be replenished, many experts fear shortages down the line. “In not a very long time, 10 years maybe, we are going to have really big problems, conflicts with water,” says Cesar Portocarrero Rodriguez, former head of the National Glacier Unit in Huaraz. “We already have problems with water in some parts of Peru,” he says, “but the big problem is coming. These are just the small signs.” Those small signs, though, matter tremendously to front-lines communities like Huaraz. Looking out upon Palcacocha, Morales is hopeful that glacial experts will be able to divert disaster. The new early warning system is nearing installation, and preliminary studies for the dam are moving along. It’s a bright, sunny day, and the clouds sweeping over the mountains are unthreatening. You can see the snow capped peaks reflected in the azure waters of the lake. It is hard to believe something so beautiful could also be so deadly. “But who knows how much time we have,” Morales muses. He admits that he fears for the safety of his family and friends who live in the valley below. “Every day I see the glacier changing,” he says. “And it appears it is a problem around the world.

We've compiled a list of ideas that will convince your friends to choose your party. Consider a raffle where the prize is unique, like a big pineapple or a dog, or both. If you're trying to have a low budget, consider a public space with lots of food, like a grocery store. Consider a live animal that people typically wouldn’t associate with Christmas, such as an alligator or gang of baby possums. If you're really feeling desperate, consider individually texting all of your friends saying there’s an intruder in your home and your trapped, and they’re the only ones that can save you. If you want rich people at your party, say there's cocaine. Consider having an activity that most people wouldn’t have. Rather than, say, a dart board or chocolate fountain, try simulating an avalanche inside your apartment, or having one of those fake snow covered snowboarding half pipes. Lie that you got engaged, or are pregnant and it's a shower, then when they show up, they already have gifts for the White Elephant.

North Shore Rescue (NSR) crews have been called to a remote area between Runner Peak and Mount Elsay.
NSR confirms they were contacted early Monday morning.
“They were both hit by an avalanche,” Allan McMordie, a search manager with North Shore Rescue.
“One of the party is hanging on to a tree so that he doesn’t slide down any further and he was able to phone out to 911. They also activated a spot so we also got called by the emergency number through the spot locator device.”
Around 4 p.m., crews were able to reach the man by longline and he has been taken to a staging area.
McMordie says at this time, they do not know where the second person is located.
The two people were snowshoeing when they were caught in the avalanche.

NSR confirmed earlier Monday it is responding to a “Code Alpha” avalanche response plan, which is put in place when an avalanche is suspected to have buried a person.
“Everybody knows we’ve had a lot of snow in the last week here,” McMordie said. “It did solidify somewhat in the good weather, but a lot of stuff was breaking off and icy so obviously there was some stuff up on Runner that broke off and took these guys out.
Search and Rescue members have mobilized at Mt. Seymour in efforts to find some hikers that may be trapped in an avalanche.
“We’ve got cloud cover down low enough to prevent us from getting up to the peaks of Seymour and of Runner. Runner’s a difficult peak to get up to. Once you get up to the third pe]ak of Seymour, you then have to drop considerably down into a gully and then climb back up either east or west side.”
About 25 people are responding to the search, along with members from Whistler Search and Rescue with avalanche dogs.

AP,"PARIS (AP) A 12-year-old boy in the French Alps was found alive and uninjured after being buried under an avalanche for 40 minutes, an event his rescuers are calling a true miracle.
French police in the town of Bourg Saint-Maurice said the boy was skiing off piste at the La Plagne ski resort in a group of seven skiers Wednesday when he was swept away.
The boy started going down ahead of the others and was the only one caught when a large section of snow detached and roared down the mountain, police said. He was dragged at least 100 meters (110 yards) by the force of the avalanche.
Rescue workers flew in a helicopter to the avalanche scene, which was at 2,400 meters (7,875 feet) altitude. A sniffer dog found the boy, whose winter jacket was not equipped with an avalanche detector.
Rescue workers described the operation as miraculous because they said chances of survival are minuscule after 15 minutes under the snow. Police said among the reasons the boy survived is that his airways were not blocked by snow.
We can call it a miracle. A day after Christmas, there was another gift in store, Captain Patrice Ribes said.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Photo: The Associated Press) DALLAS (AP) — The Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals have traded veteran defenseman Brooks Orpik and backup goaltender Philipp Grubauer to the Colorado Avalanche for the 47th pick in the NHL draft. The teams announced the draft before the start of the draft Friday night. The trade clears salary-cap space for Washington, which is attempting to re-sign pending free agent defenseman John Carlson. The 37-year-old Orpik had one year left on his contract at a cap hit of $5.5 million. Grubauer joins fellow Capitals draft pick Semyon Varlamov with the Avalanche where he'll get the chance to start more games than he did behind Braden Holtby in Washington. Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan called it a difficult decision but one he had to make to give his team flexibility moving forward.

Associated Press,"(BERLIN) — Three German skiers have been killed in an avalanche in Austria and a fourth is still missing, police said Sunday as snowfall set in again in the northern Alps. In France, two ski patrollers were killed when the devices they use to trigger avalanches exploded.
The two accidents brought to at least 26 the number of weather-related deaths reported in parts of Europe this month.
In Austria, the wife of one of the German skiers reported them missing on Saturday. The bodies of the men, aged 57, 36 and 32, were recovered later Saturday evening near the ski resort of Lech.
Police in Vorarlberg, Austria’s westernmost province, said they had to call off the search for another missing German skier in the group, age 28, because of heavy snow and the risk of avalanches.
Police said the four friends had apparently skied onto a trail that was closed. Although they had avalanche protection equipment and deployed airbags, the victims were buried by the avalanche and suffered multiple injuries. They were located with the help of cellphone tracking.
In France, the Haute-Savoie region’s high mountain gendarmerie said the two ski patrollers were killed Sunday morning in Morillon before ski slopes were opened to the public. Officers were investigating the scene to determine the cause of the rare accident.
Ski patrollers are in charge of preventing potential dangers to skiers, notably by triggering controlled avalanches with powerful explosive charges.
Authorities in southern Germany and Austria had used a break in the weather to clear heavy loads of snow from roofs and roads, but snow set in again on Saturday night.
In the Bavarian town of Kempten, local authorities closed 11 sports halls as a precaution through Tuesday fearing that the weight of snow on their roofs was posing increasing dangers, the German news agency dpa reported.
Trains between the German cities of Munich and Lindau were traveling more slowly than usual because of a risk of snow-laden trees falling onto the tracks.
The small Alpine resort of Balderschwang on Germany’s border with Austria was cut off Sunday after the pass leading to it was closed for fear of avalanches.
In central Switzerland, trains carrying cars through the Furka tunnel were suspended because of an avalanche on a nearby road.

PENN BULLOCK,"Venezuelas opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, has toured South America for much of the past week. Defying a government-imposed travel ban, he met with the far-right president of Brazil and the center-left president of Ecuador, among others, to demonstrate the broad international support for his claim to be the legitimate leader of Venezuela. 
Each day he spends out the country, though, he risks losing the unity of opposition parties, already reeling after President Nicolás Maduro last month reduced Mr. Guaidós promised aid avalanche at the border to a few flakes. Mr. Guaidó had vowed to re-enter Venezuela as those aid shipments broke through Mr. Maduros blockade. He has now set a deadline of this morning for his return. 
Mr. Maduro has threatened to have him arrested. 
Bigger picture: With Mr. Maduro firmly controlling the borders, and defections from his military so far a trickle, the opposition is realizing that the governments rule appears to be more durable than Mr. Guaidó had painted it.
Looking ahead: The secretary general of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, who is one of Mr. Guaidós chief international supporters, softened his demands on Mr. Maduro, saying he would not object to his running for office again in new elections if they were free and fair.","Venezuela’s opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, waving to supporters in Colombia last month.",2019-03-04T04:58:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Venezuela, India, North Korea: Your Monday Briefing",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/briefing/venezuela-india-north-korea-your-monday-briefing.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/04/briefing/030419briefing-europe-promo/030419briefing-europe-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,avalanche,1
Kirsten Acuna,"Rapper Mac Miller died Friday of an apparent overdose at 26. Shortly after the news broke, a flood of comments blaming ex Ariana Grande for his death started filling her Instagram feed. It became so bad, comments on the singer's Instagram page have been disabled. Here's how a post on Ariana Grande's Instagram currently looks. @arianagrande/Instagram Many quickly came to Grande's defense telling people to stop blaming her for the death of her ex. Miller and Grande dated for two years until May 2018. Grande called her relationship with the rapper ""toxic"" on Twitter after their breakup. Grande was responding to a fan who questioned her new relationship with ""Saturday Night Live"" star Pete Davidson so soon after her breakup from Miller. ""How absurd that you minimize female self-respect and self-worth by saying someone should stay in a toxic relationship because he wrote an album about them, which btw isn't the case (just Cinderella is ab me),"" Grande wrote in a long message posted to Twitter. ""I am not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel that they need to be."" ""I have cared for him and tried to support his sobriety &amp; prayed for his balance for years (and always will of course) but shaming/blaming women for a man's inability to keep his s-t together is a very major problem,"" Grande added, saying that she would continue to pray for Miller. In July, during an interview with Beats 1, Miller said he was happy for Grande moving forward. He stressed he didn't feel negatively about his breakup with the singer. ""It's just a part of something that's gonna continue to help make me who I am,"" Miller said of his relationship with Grande. ""It's all positive energy.

CHRISTOPHER CLAREY,"Back on the academy grounds, a short walk downhill from the resort, there is now campuswide Wi-Fi and a capacious indoor training facility, the Ronnie Berlack Center, which opened in December 2015 and serves as a poignant reminder of the dangers of Alpine skiing.
Berlack, a 20-year-old alumnus, and Bryce Astle, 19, were killed in an avalanche in Sölden, Austria, on Jan. 5, 2015, while free skiing on an off day from training with the U.S. Ski Teams development squad. Berlack and Shiffrin trained together at the academy. 
He used to hate it when shed beat him, Steve Berlack, Ronnies father, said. They built a lot of speed chasing each other.
Though Shiffrins serial success runs the risk of making her less relatable to current students, Berlack, a longtime coach at Burke, believes there are still lessons to pass on.
You might not be able to ski like Mikaela or have the results of Mikaela, Berlack said. But you can go to bed when she did. You can eat like she did. You can do recovery like she did, take care of your equipment like she did, focus on your mental strength like she did.

Jason Schreier,"A video, leaked this morning by a Reddit user who says they captured it from a focus group, shows an apparent big-budget Harry Potter game that looks fantastic. Publisher Warner Bros. has yanked the video from YouTube, but you can watch a mirror here. The footage shows, among other things: Wizards in Hogwarts academy casting spells, alchemical experiments, owls and magical beasts, and even a glimpse of the whimsical village of Hogsmeade, located right near Hogwarts campus. The Reddit leaker, who goes by VapeThisBro, describes the game as a third-person open-world action game in which you customize your own wizard, a fifth-year student at Hogwarts. Observers early this morning theorized that this game might be made by Arkham developer Rocksteady Studios, but we dont believe thats the case. (From what Ive heard, Rocksteady is still sticking to superheroes.) One possibility is that this game is in development at Avalanche Software, the Utah-based company that was once owned by Disney before it was temporarily shut down in 2016, then brought back to life by Warner Bros. Job listings dug up in early 2017 for Avalanche Softwarenot to be confused with Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios, which is based in Sweden and New York Citycertainly point to a game like this. We are looking for a talented storyteller with a deep understanding of British culture and grammatical presentation. Is this a brand new Harry Potter video game for next year or even the next generation of consoles, which we expect to see released in 2020 ?

Mary Papenfuss,"A large avalanche roared down a slope on Mammoth Mountain in California on Saturday morning. Though there were no reports of injuries or people missing by late afternoon, rescuers continued to search for any possible victims. “Essentially the top of the mountain came loose,” skier Barbara Maynard told The Los Angeles Times. She said it was quickly “pandemonium” as ambulances, police and fire trucks roared in, and ski patrol members traveled up the mountain on snowmobiles. Witnesses reported trees broken and fences flattened or buried. Three people, including a resort worker, were partially buried but managed to free themselves and were uninjured, according to the resort. The slope was closed to skiing when the avalanche hit, but the snow pushed into an area open to the public. Mammoth was shut down for the day, but operators said they hope to reopen Sunday. The resort is located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range about 300 miles north of Los Angeles. The avalanche came on the heels of another one Friday at Squaw Valley near Lake Tahoe that injured two people. A major storm front packing high winds and dropping from four to six feet of snow is currently hitting the Sierra Nevada mountains. The Mammoth avalanche hit when ski patrols were conducting “avalanche hazard mitigation work,” according to the resort. That usually includes explosions to knock unstable snow off overhangs before they fall naturally and trigger avalanches. “A full investigation is ongoing,” the resort said in statement.","Three people were initially buried in the avalanche, but were able to free themselves.",2018-03-04T02:05:45Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Large Avalanche Hits California’s Busy Mammoth Ski Resort,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mammoth-mountain-avalanche_us_5a9b2d1ae4b089ec353ae42a,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9b342b1f00002d00169089.jpeg?cache=0JFA42HaND&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,avalanche,1

ABC News,"A winter storm that roared through California left a snowboarder dead and sent an avalanche crashing down on five people Friday at a Sierra Nevada ski resort, but the danger of another deadly mudslide eased in a devastated coastal community. Dozens of rescuers and rescue dogs rushed to the scene after an avalanche hit the Squaw Valley Ski Resort near Lake Tahoe near the Nevada state line. One man was hospitalized with a serious lower body injury, another person was treated for injuries and released while three other people escaped injury, the resort said in a statement. Heather Turping was snowboarding with her boyfriend when she heard someone scream ""Avalanche!"" and saw ""a cloud of snow coming down."" ""It was massive,"" she said. ""It just happened to literally pass a foot in front of me."" A woman screamed that her husband was missing and someone spotted a snowboard poking out of the snow. ""That's what saved his life,"" Turping said. ""I took my gloves off and I helped dig him out,"" she said. ""When he got uncovered, a ski patroller said, 'You were under for six minutes.'"" The man wasn't seriously hurt and was able to snowboard back down the mountain, she said. The skiers and snowboarders were within areas open to skiing at the time and the guests had been warned of the potential danger, resort spokeswoman Liesl Hepburn said. The resort used explosives and other tools to knock down snow to prevent avalanches throughout the day but the snowfall was heavy, she said. ""We had assessed the area to be safe to open to the public and unfortunately an avalanche did occur after that assessment was made,"" Hepburn said. The avalanche occurred hours after the body of a missing snowboarder was found at the same resort. Wenyu Zhang, 42, vanished Thursday as the region was hit by a blizzard packing winds gusting to nearly 150 mph (241 kph) over the ridge tops. It dumped 3 feet (1 meter) of snow in the mountains. A blizzard warning expired Friday but whiteout conditions were still possible around Lake Tahoe, where a winter storm warning remained in effect until 10 a.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service said. About 300 miles (482 kilometers) south, rain fell in the coastal foothill communities of Santa Barbara County, where thousands of people had been told to flee out of concern that the approaching storm might send huge swathes of fire-scarred slopes rushing down on them. But the rain that moved through Southern California Thursday night and Friday spared Montecito, which saw hundreds of homes destroyed in January mudslides. Twenty-one people were killed then and two remain missing. Evacuation orders affecting up to 30,000 people on the south Santa Barbara County coast were lifted at midmorning. ""The worst of the storm has passed and we are cautiously optimistic that due to a significant amount of pre-storm preparation we have come through this with minimal impact,"" said Rob Lewin, director of the county Office of Emergency management. Some minor roadway flooding occurred, but the region's main highway, U.S. 101, remained open throughout the storm. Officials said 87 percent of those in the threatened areas complied with the evacuation order. ——— Associated Press writer John Antczak in Los Angeles and Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, contributed to this report.","ABC News California storm kills 1, avalanche injures 2 at ski resort ABC News A truck heads west through the snow on Interstate 80, Thursday, March 1, 2018, near Donner Summit, Calif.

ALEXANDER BURNS and CHARLIE SAVAGE,"“You don’t have impeachment unless the case is so strong that you will convince a good fraction — not a majority, necessarily, but a good fraction — of the people who voted for Trump that you had to do it,” Mr. Nadler said. Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said he expected voters would ultimately render judgment on Mr. Mueller’s findings. Expressing indifference to Mr. Giuliani’s pronouncements, Mr. Kennedy said he hoped Mr. Mueller would give a full report on Russian interference in American elections, and soon. “Once he finishes the investigation, I want him to report to the American people and let the chips fall where they may,” Mr. Kennedy said of the special counsel. “And I trust the American people to figure it out.” But Mr. Kennedy does not face re-election until 2022, and few politicians on the ballot this fall share his serene outlook. While some candidates on the left and right have sought to exploit the Mueller investigation in different ways — Democrats calling for impeachment, Republicans demonizing the special counsel — most politicians in difficult races have sought to avoid the issue. They have largely adopted a posture of deference to Mr. Mueller, insisting that the special counsel must finish his work before they judge the facts. That day of judgment, however, may be approaching with inconvenient speed. Should Mr. Mueller unearth information implicating the president or members of his immediate family in serious crimes, it could put enormous and in many cases unwanted pressure on Congress to take action — and on congressional candidates to take a stand. Mr. Trump and his lawyers have denied that he conspired with Russians to influence the 2016 election, or that he did anything to obstruct an investigation into Russian interference. Already, several dozen Democrats voted earlier this year to advance an impeachment resolution against Mr. Trump, and public opinion polls show the idea of toppling the president is hugely popular with Democratic voters. Holding back an avalanche of impeachment calls could prove difficult for the party in the event of a damning report.","Should Robert S.

Proma Khosla,"Here's a pro-tip if you're trying to shut up and listen to women: Shut up. Matt Damon, who has been speaking out following the avalanche of sexual assault and misconduct allegations in Hollywood, has stepped up to the mic for a third attempt at advocating for women in Hollywood, and once again falls flat. In an interview with Peter Travers for ABC News, Damon repeatedly emphasized that the current reckoning Hollywood right now is good and that women should be listened to, but seems to face a near-constant internal struggle to reconcile that idea with everything he knows about business and entertainment. SEE ALSO: An incomplete list of celebrity statements on Harvey Weinstein In the full interview, which you can read and watch here, Damon ""right""s and ""okay""s his way through the minefield of sexual misconduct fallout and definitely takes a few hits. Below, some ""highlights"": ""We live in this culture of outrage and injury, and, you know, that we’re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, 'Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.'

I imagine the price that he’s paid at this point is so beyond anything that he — I just think that we have to kind of start delineating between what these behaviors are."" ""...at what point does somebody’s behavior that you have a professional relationship with … away from the profession bother enough that you don’t want to work with them? For me, I’ve always kind of, you know, as long as nobody’s committing a crime — well, that’s your life, and you go live it. I don’t need to be spending time with you, away from my professional life, at least."" ""If it’s a friend of mine, I’m always talking to them. I know the real story if it’s my friend. If it’s a colleague … I don’t know … I guess it depends on the situation and the allegation and how believable I think it is.""

It might be hard to watch colleagues' careers crumble around him, but the argument being made in this cultural moment is that men like Weinstein robbed promising young women of their careers for decades. No one is asking that men in Hollywood be perfect, but at a bare minimum we are asking them to not assault and harass women.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Athens just put in a pretty strong bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics. A huge dip in the jet stream has allowed polar air to plunge into the normally temperate Mediterranean, dumping snow in Greeces capital and beach resort towns. 
On Tuesday, otherworldly scenes emerged across the country as snow caked iconic tourist attractions like the Acropolis and bent olive and cypress trees branches. Tourists and locals alike stopped to gawk at the ethereal sites and snap photos. 
Athens was far from the only locale to see snow. That coastal resort town of Thessaloniki in northeast Greece was buffeted by snow. Drone footage shows the incongruous scenes of snow on the Mediterranean beaches that are normally a tourist hot spot (at least a few locals still decided to take a polar bear plunge). 
The snow was more than a photo op, though. It also stranded motorists and led to disrupted rail service. At least one inbound flight was re-routed from Thessaloniki due to poor visibility, according to France24.
And the flakes also came with a blast of polar air, which France24 reports has claimed at least three lives. Reuters reports that the northern Greek city of Florina recorded an all-time low of minus-9 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-23 degrees Celsius). Meanwhile much of the country has seen temperatures dip 20 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) below normal for this time of year.
The pattern befalling Greece has brought wild weather to the rest of Europe as well. Ski resorts in the Alps have seen up to 100 inches of snow fall, creating deadly avalanche conditions. Winter storms have also battered northern Europe with winds and coastal flooding, including some of the worst flooding in decades in Denmark. But its the Greek snow thats been a real show stopper.

We may receive a small commission from our partners, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. Nearly half of American households are in credit-card debt, carrying an average of $6,929, according to a NerdWallet analysis. 
 Any amount of debt can feel suffocating and even insurmountable given that the average annual percentage rate (APR) is creeping toward 18%, but there are ways to get out from under it. 
 Business Insider asked financial planners their favorite way to get out of credit-card debt, and they all recommended two equally effective strategies: the debt snowball and the debt avalanche. 
 ""I would start with writing it all out,"" Nick Vail, a CFP at Integrity Wealth Advisors, told Business Insider. ""This can be eye opening in and of itself."" First, write down exactly how much you owe and the interest rate on each account. Then figure out how much money you can afford to put toward debt payments every month. 
 In any case, you'll continue to pay at least the minimum payment on all debt balances. With the debt snowball method, you'll put any extra money toward your smallest debt until that's paid off, and then you'll tackle the next highest balance. With the debt avalanche, you'll prioritize the highest-interest rate debt first, and so on. 
 For either strategy to be effective, you must continue making at least the minimum payment on all balances. Making late payments or no payments can be damaging to your credit score, as can keeping total balances that take up more than 30% of your credit limit — known formally as your credit utilization rate. 
 ""The avalanche method is typically the most efficient mathematically, but the snowball method might give you the most satisfaction to keep you motivated,"" said Luis Rosa, a CFP who founded the financial-planning firm Build a Better Financial Future.

 ""I'm usually an optimizer, but for those with balances on multiple cards, I love Dave Ramsey's snowball method,"" said Andrew Westlin, a CFP at Betterment. ""Getting that first balance paid off builds confidence and momentum, and these small wins are crucial in long-term success,"" he said. 
 Most importantly, find a strategy you can commit to, said Bobbi Rebell, CFP.

Jeff Grubb,"Bethesda opened its media presentation prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show with Rage 2 from developers id Software and Avalanche Studios. Like the original, this sequel is a shooter in a post-apocalyptic world filled with marauders, pirates, and freaks. And Bethesda confirmed that it is launching for PC and consoles in the spring. In a new trailer, Bethesda showed off how the gameplay combines intense shooting action with car combat. The shooting sequences featured frantic, fast-paced gunplay that is reminiscent of id’s 2016 Doom release. To take out foes, you can shoot them, but you can also charge them with melee attacks or use a stunning ground-pound move. Your character also has specialized weapons like a glaive that wraps enemies up and sends them slowly into the air for you to finish off with a few rounds to the chest. As for the vehicle sections, the action looked similar to what Avalanche did with its Mad Max. You can see the game in action below: Rage 2 was one of the biggest games that leaked out prior to the 2018 Electronic Entertainment Expo thanks to Walmart Canada. Bethesda was quick to begin teasing the game, and then it confirmed it with a trailer May 14. This is a sequel to the 2011 PC and console shooter Rage from id Software. That game also featured a postapocalyptic world with lots of gunplay and driving, but it was maligned by some critics for its reliance on a dull, brown color palette. For Rage 2, it looks like Avalanche is going to punch up that world with bursts of color.","Bethesda opened its media presentation prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show with Rage 2 from developers id Software and Avalanche Studios.

"AP, AP","Montreal Canadiens goaltender Antti Niemi pulls up his helmet during a time out against the Colorado Avalanche in the first period of an NHL hockey game Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2018, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press) DENVER (AP) — Semyon Varlamov rescued Colorado's struggling offense with a stellar performance against Montreal. Varlamov made 43 saves for his first victory in more than a month and the Avalanche matched the franchise record of 10 straight home wins, beating the Canadiens 2-0 on Wednesday night. Carl Soderberg and Alexander Kerfoot scored to help Colorado equal the longest home winning streak in franchise history, set in 1994-95 when the team was the Quebec Nordiques. ""It seems for us it's harder to play the road these days,"" Varlamov said. ""We've got to play like that on the road trips."" Antti Niemi stopped 23 shots for Montreal. The Canadiens are 8-17-1 on the road. ""We didn't find a way to put the puck in the net,"" forward Brendan Gallagher said. Varlamov's play had a lot to do with that problem. His last win came against Toronto on Dec. 29, and he left his next start against Winnipeg with a groin injury. He missed 10 games before returning against the Jets on Feb. 3. Wednesday was his fourth game since coming back and one of his best this year. He denied the Canadiens on several chances in the third for his second shutout of the season. ""I didn't love us tonight, but Varly comes up big and gets us a win,"" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. ""That's what you need sometimes out of your goaltenders. He was really good, we get the win. That's good; we needed the points."" The Avalanche moved within two points of Minnesota for the second wild card in the Western Conference. They're keeping pace without leading scorer Nathan MacKinnon, who has missed seven games with a left shoulder injury. Colorado has scored two or fewer goals in four of those games, including Wednesday night, but Varlamov made the two goals stand up. He was instrumental in Montreal going 0 for 4 on the power play, including 40 seconds with a two-man advantage in the second period. ""I thought our power play could have won us the game and they weren't good tonight,"" Canadiens coach Claude Julien said. ""Our (penalty kill) did a great job tonight but our PP wasn't good enough. When you're looking to score goals your PP has to come up big, especially when you have a 5-on-3."" Colorado had more than two consecutive minutes of play in Montreal's end early in the second period but didn't score until Soderberg beat Niemi with a wraparound at 15:55. With Montreal pressing for the equalizer late in the third, Kerfoot scored at 16:58 to give the Avalanche a two-goal cushion. ""I think I had the whole net there and it found a way to squeak in,"" said Kerfoot, who has 14 goals in his rookie season. ""It was good that we got one at the end there."" NOTES: There was a moment of silence before the national anthems for the victims of the school shooting in Florida.... The Avalanche recalled Rocco Grimaldi from San Antonio of the AHL. MacKinnon, out since Jan. 30, was placed on injured reserve to make room for Grimaldi on the roster.... Montreal C Phillip Danault (concussion) is on the four-game trip but has not played since Jan. 13.... This was the 3,000th game in Quebec/Colorado franchise history, with 1,744 having been played since the team became the Avalanche in 1995....

"AP, AP","Colorado Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon (29) moves the puck across the blue line during the first period of a preseason NHL hockey game against the Vegas Golden Knights on Tuesday, Sept. 18, 2018, in Denver. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey) (Photo: The Associated Press) DENVER (AP) — Mention a topic, just about any topic, and sharp-shooting Colorado Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon takes his elusiveness to a whole new level. Not appearing on the cover of the NHL's latest video game? ""Don't care,"" he responds. The pressure of becoming one of league's top stars after a 97-point season? ""Feels normal,"" the top pick in the 2013 draft quips. Taking another step in his evolution on the ice? ""Hopefully a few,"" he offers. It's not like the speedy, 23-year-old shies away from the spotlight he has earned through his electrifying play. Rather, he's just highly focused on helping Colorado return to the playoffs after a stirring run a year ago behind his hard-to-keep-up speed and hard-to-stop shot. ""He's a legitimate, bona fide superstar in our league,"" said defenseman Ian Cole, who joined the Avs after spending last season with Pittsburgh and Columbus. ""He's one of the most dangerous players in the league."" MacKinnon finished with 39 goals and 58 assists last season. He finished second to New Jersey Devils forward Taylor Hall in voting for the Hart Memorial Trophy, which is given to the player who means the most to their team. That didn't exactly sit well with MacKinnon's line mate, captain Gabriel Landeskog. In Landeskog's view, seeing is believing in MacKinnon's skills. ""The hockey world is big in the East and they don't see Nate as much, or us as much,"" Landeskog said. ""We all know how good he is. It's a matter of time. But he doesn't need the recognition from anybody else — we just need him to keep doing what he's doing as far as being a really good offensive player."" MacKinnon turned in a breakout season in which he posted stats that hadn't been seen in Colorado in a while, including: — Most points by an Avalanche player since Joe Sakic had 100 in 2006-07 — Most shots (284) since Sakic during the Stanley Cup championship season in 2000-01 — 12 game-winning goals, matching the Avalanche record set by Sakic in '00-01 — 13 three-point games, which was the most since Peter Forsberg had 14 in 2002-03. Quite a list — and one he hopes to top this season. That's why his summer consisted of working out every day and skating three times a week. Maybe an occasional round of golf, but his world revolved around the rink. ""I'm always thinking about hockey,"" MacKinnon said. ""Not stressing over it, but definitely always thinking about it. I worked hard because another 100 points isn't going to be handed to me. It's tough to get that many. I don't know if I will get that many this year. But I'll try to and see what happens."" MacKinnon's prepared to embrace the pressure of being one of the game's elite players. Then again, expectations have never weighed down MacKinnon, a native of Halifax, Nova Scotia. ""Growing up, I was always a top prospect, and I went first overall. So it just feels normal,"" said MacKinnon, who signed a seven-year, $44.1 million deal in July 2016. ""It's somewhere I expect to be. It's not like I won the lottery here. I feel like I've earned that."" He wasn't one of the cover players for EA Sports' NHL '19, which features Nashville defenseman P.K. Subban, Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky, Winnipeg winger Patrik Laine, and Toronto center William Nylander on respective editions. ""I really don't care,"" MacKinnon said. ""I just don't."" More on his mind is getting the Avalanche back to the postseason. The team earned the No. 8 seed with a win in their last contest of the season before being eliminated in six games by Nashville. ""We're trying to prove ourselves,"" said MacKinnon, who missed eight games in February with a shoulder injury. ""I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing — keep getting better by doing the little things. Be very consistent every night and making sure I'm healthy and feeling good."" That sort of mentality is music to the ears of Avalanche coach Jared Bednar. ""He's one of the hungriest guys I've ever met. He's one of the hardest working guys I've ever met,"" Bednar said. ""He's hungry to prove that (last season) wasn't a one-off — that's who he is. He expects to be even better this year."" Maybe even the best in the league. ""I'd like to. I'm working for that,"" MacKinnon said. ""I'm trying to be the best me, and hopefully that's the best player in the NHL."" ___ For more AP NHL coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Avalanche open training camp on Friday, Sept. 14. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (Photo: The Associated Press) DENVER (AP) — Heading into last season, the theme was a ""something-to-prove"" refrain from captain Gabriel Landeskog and the Colorado Avalanche. This season, it's more of a ""need-to-be-respected"" tune. The Avs caught a lot of teams by surprise a season ago when they improved by 47 points to make the postseason. They know they won't be catching anyone off guard this time around. They also know they have the speed, youth and the scoring skills of Nathan MacKinnon to help them make another playoff appearance. ""We can't sell ourselves short,"" said Landeskog, whose team kicked off training camp this week. ""We have to make sure we come in with some swagger. We know what we accomplished last year, getting to the playoffs, and how there weren't a whole lot of people who thought we'd do that. We have to remember how much hard work we put into that and know we aren't going to catch anybody sleeping. ""Everybody knows we're a good team and here to stay."" Colorado's roster looks similar to a season ago, with a couple of tweaks. The team added more of a veteran presence with left wing Matt Calvert and defenseman Ian Cole. They also traded with Washington to acquire goaltender Philipp Grubauer as an insurance policy in case the injury-plagued Semyon Varlamov gets hurt. A return trip to the playoffs won't be easy — the Central Division is stacked with Stanley Cup contenders. ""Are we one of them?"" Landeskog quickly added. ""It's important to realize there's a difference between being confident and being cocky,"" said Landeskog, whose team lost in six games to Nashville during the first round last April. ""We have to make sure we're confident and have that swagger, but not thinking we're better than we are, either."" Not an issue. They still remember 2016-17, when they accumulated a league-low 48 points. They rebounded to 95 points last season, making the postseason on the final day by beating St. Louis 5-2 in a winner-take-all showdown. ""Last year we had something to prove and had a chip on our shoulder,"" defenseman Tyson Barrie said. ""That worked well for us. Not a lot of people expected much out of us. It felt really good to prove them wrong."" Colorado was one of the youngest teams in the league last season, with 11 different rookies dressing. They brought energy to an already speedy team. ""That injection of young guys coming in, really enthusiastic and excited to play, really rubbed off on a lot of guys,"" Landeskog said. ""It showed in the way we played. We're still young, and it's just a matter of taking that next step."" MacKinnon is coming off a monster season in which he had 97 points (39 goals, 58 assists). It was the most points by an Avalanche player since Hall of Famer turned general manager Joe Sakic had 100 in 2006-07. MacKinnon wants to elevate his game to an even higher level. ""I'm trying to be the best me, and hopefully that's the best player in the NHL,"" said MacKinnon, the top pick in the 2013 draft. ""I'm doing everything I can to get better."" Varlamov was solid in net for the Avalanche, before suffering a knee injury against Chicago on March 30 and missing the rest of the season, including the playoffs. He's healthy again and ready to contend with Grubauer for playing time. ""Every year is a big, big year,"" Varlamov said. ""Every year you try to improve yourself."" Grubauer, who is coming off a Stanley Cup win with the Capitals, was asked how many games he hopes to start. ""I want to play every one,"" he cracked. ""I'm really stoked to be here. I think there are big things coming up here. ""The team is really young and that makes it really exciting for everybody. In Washington, the last couple of years, we learned from our mistakes. You saw it a couple seasons ago — Colorado wasn't the best and then the next season they took off.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (Photo: The Associated Press) DENVER (AP) The speedy, full-tilt pace on the ice remains in place for the Colorado Avalanche. Same with that salty attitude to prove they belong. Don't even mention any preseason hype, because they're not listening. That's because playing last season with a chip on their shoulder worked so well as they made the postseason for the first time since 2013-14. Colorado will stick with the same sort of demeanor this season. ""We are trying to prove ourselves,"" All-Star center Nathan MacKinnon said. ""We're not guaranteed a playoff spot by any means."" Colorado improved by 47 points a season ago, going from 48 in 2016-17 during Jared Bednar's first season in charge to 95 and earning the eighth seed in the playoffs on their final game of the season. The Avs were eliminated from the postseason by Nashville in six games. The youthful squad added more veterans in the offseason by bringing in defenseman Ian Cole and forward Matt Calvert. Still, the fast-skating MacKinnon is putting the brakes on any sort of talk about a deep playoff run. The goal is to play with a sense of urgency all season long. ""If we had an off-night, we lost last season,"" MacKinnon said. ""We're going to have to be at 100 percent this season to win. Right now we're just trying to make the playoffs. Hopefully, the playoffs is a given in a couple of years here."" The team marches to the beat of the 23-year-old MacKinnon and his fellow linemates captain Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen. They were put together on Oct. 28 and combined for 225 points. MacKinnon finished runner-up in the Hart Memorial Trophy race after a season in which he had 39 goals and 58 assists. He wound up second in the NHL in points-per-game (1.31) behind Edmonton's Connor McDavid (1.32). ""He expects to be even better this year,"" Bednar said. ""His linemates are of a similar mindset."" Here are things to know before the Avalanche kick off the season Oct. 4 at home against Minnesota: VARLY &amp; GRUBY For now, the net belongs to veteran goaltender Semyon Varlamov, who's returning from a knee injury that kept him out of the playoffs. But Philipp Grubauer, who was acquired from Washington in a June trade, is pushing hard for playing time. Colorado may need two strong goaltenders, given the injury history of Varlamov. ""I've had some ups and downs in my hockey career. Some big injuries,"" Varlamov said. ""Hopefully this year will mean Gruby and me will help the team be successful."" OLD MAN &amp; HIS D Now 30, defenseman Erik Johnson is one of the older players on the team. He averaged a career-high 25:26 of ice time, but was sidelined for the playoffs with a knee injury. ""I still feel young,"" said Johnson, who was the top overall pick by St. Louis in 2006. ""Thirty in the NHL is old in the league, but young in life. It's a different perspective for me to be in. It goes by super-fast."" Johnson figures to be paired with 20-year-old Samuel Girard on the blue line this season. YOUTH IS SERVED Colorado boasted one of the younger teams in the league last season, with 11 different rookies dressing. The team can't afford any sort of sophomore slump from players such as Alexander Kerfoot, Tyson Jost or Girard. ""I'm excited to get on the ice and prove to everyone that I have a lot more to offer than I did last year,"" said Jost, who had 12 goals and 10 assists in 65 games as he dealt with leg and lower-body injuries. ""I worked really hard this offseason to elevate my game."" PROTECTING HOME The noise returned to the Pepsi Center as the fans packed the seats. Colorado won 28 games in its building, which tied the franchise record set by the 2000-01 Stanley Cup squad. The Avs had a run where they won 10 in a row at home. HANGING 10 Varlamov believes a fast start is imperative. Of the opening 10 contests, six are on the road, including a four-game stretch in which they play at the New York Rangers, New Jersey Devils, Carolina and Philadelphia. The team began 5-5 last season. ""We have to play strong and collect the points right away,"" Varlamov said. ""Because it's always hard to play catch-up hockey in the NHL. We have to make sure we start the season with a good start."" ___ More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"USA TODAY, Kevin Allen, USA TODAY","SportsPulse: NHL insider Kevin Allen details his 2018-19 season projections and who's winning it all. USA TODAY Jack Hughes will be the prize for the team that wins the draft lottery this season. (Photo: Nick Wosika, Icon Sportswire via AP) Speedy. Flashy. Dominating. Elusive. Creative. Words used to describe U.S. National Team Development star Jack Hughes leave a clear understanding about why he is projected to be the NHL’s No. 1 draft pick next summer. “He understands how gifted he is, but he doesn’t overthink it,” said former Calgary Flames general manager Craig Button, now a draft expert for Canada’s TSN. “He’s one of those players who not only has an imagination and creativity … but he’s a great decision tree player. He processes everything quickly. He has algorithms going on in his head. If I can’t do that, I will do this.” If Hughes, who won't turn 18 until May, goes first, and scouts say it is highly likely he will, Hughes would be the eighth American to be drafted No. 1 overall. Because of Hughes’ dynamic style, NHL team fan bases are already talking about whether their team will be in the Hughes sweepstakes. More: NHL point projections: How we see the 2018-19 season unfolding More: NHL players survey: Moderate to strong concerns about concussions Here is our projection for the teams with the best opportunity to land Hughes: 1. Colorado Avalanche: This is the best possible situation for the Avalanche because they can qualify for the playoffs and end up with the most attractive odds to secure Hughes. Their chance comes from owning the Ottawa Senators’ first-round pick, which was acquired in last season's three-team deal that sent Matt Duchene to Ottawa and Kyle Turris to the Nashville Predators. The Senators, who finished 30th last season, could have given the Avalanche their 2018 pick. But they drafted Brady Tkachuk at No. 4 and will take their chances this season. They will struggle after trading Erik Karlsson and Mike Hoffman. 2. Detroit Red Wings : Because the Red Wings are rebuilding, many Detroit fans are hoping they will be near the bottom of the standings to have a better chance to win the draft lottery. The idea of a Hughes-Dylan Larkin one-two center tandem is appealing. The Red Wings will give considerable playing time to their younger players, such as Larkin, Anthony Mantha, Michael Rasmussen, Tyler Bertuzzi, Andreas Athanasiou and perhaps Filip Zadina, who will start the year in the minors. The Red Wings are still a couple of seasons away from being competitive. 3. Montreal Canadiens: The Canadiens ranked 29th in goal scoring in 2017-18 and didn’t solve their offensive troubles this offseason. They gave up Max Pacioretty and Alex Galchenyuk and added Tomas Tatar and Max Domi. Defenseman Shea Weber is recovering from surgery and isn’t expected back until at least November. Nothing points to Montreal moving out of the bottom five this season. 4. Vancouver Canucks: There’s plenty to appreciate about the young Canucks, particularly their collection of younger players. There’s genuine excitement about Elias Pettersson being a leading Calder Trophy candidate. Brock Boeser, with his big shot and quick release, could score 35 to 40 goals this season. But it’s difficult to climb in the standings when you are relying heavily on young players. They could easily finish in the 73- to 77-point range and be in contention for Hughes. 5. New York Rangers: Their biggest obstacle to contending for Hughes is the presence of goalie Henrik Lundqvist in their lineup. By their own admission, the Rangers are retooling their roster. They were last in the Metropolitan Division last season, ranking 22nd in goals and 28th in goals against. David Quinn’s fresh coaching approach probably won’t be enough to immediately improve the team. The Rangers were 23rd in the NHL last season, and the Buffalo Sabres, Arizona Coyotes and Chicago Blackhawks should pass them this season in the overall standings.

Alison Foreman,"Alright, kiddos: it's time to right some wrongs. 
This year was a lot. From tons of big moods to moments that made us say NOPE, 2018 was a twelve-month avalanche of super intense content. With so much excellence to choose from, it's no wonder that a number of great projects failed to gain the audiences they deserved. So, let's fix that.
Whether you're looking for an adorable mobile game to play on that drive to Grandma's or a fiery series about a body-positive terrorist group to binge with your bestie, we've got you covered.
SEE ALSO: The best apps of 2018
Here are 10 hidden gems from 2018 you need to catch up on ASAP. (Then yes, by all means, keep on with that Game of Thrones rewatch.) 
10. When We First Met
Netflix had an absolute slam dunk of a year on the rom-com front. Unfortunately, When We First Met, a seemingly problematic but surprisingly lovely Adam DeVine comedy, was out-shined by its Valentine's Day competitors. However, months later, it's still available and remains an absolute treat.
Essentially a feature-length riff on one running gag from Groundhog's Day, When We First Met chronicles the time travel adventures of Noah Ashby. Bummed to have been put in the friend zone by the presumed love of his life, Avery (played by Alexandra Daddario), Noah repeatedly uses a magical photo booth to travel back in time to the 2014 Halloween party where they first met. Each time, he tries a new tactic to win her over.
The comedic writing remains solid throughout, but the real selling point for this underrated delight of a film is its overarching message of acceptance. So, if you're in need of a que sera sera palate cleanse before 2019 hits, look no further. When We First Met is worth a visit.
When We First Met is streaming on Netflix. 
9. Dead Cells
Image: motion twin
A good roguelike strikes a careful balance between making you feel a sense of progress even when the odds are always stacked against you. Dead Cells is a master class in how to perfectly nail that tricky balance.
You play as a reanimated corpse, fighting your way through a series of randomly generated environments. Along the way you come across a growing assortment of gear that you can choose to take with you or discard and what you find is entirely random. So you're constantly making choices about the kinds of weapons and abilities you want to use. Your luck with gear drops, and the decisions you land on, can make or break a run.
In the midst of all that, you're also collecting a form of currency that you can spend to power up your abilities permanently, provided you survive long enough to reach the next checkpoint. Death means something in Dead Cells; when your character dies, you're forced to start over once again with the most basic loadout and at the beginning of the game. The brilliance of Dead Cells isn't in these features specifically; you feel it more in the way everything comes together. All of these systems working in tandem amount to one of the strongest, most difficult to put down games of 2018. - Adam Rosenberg, Senior Entertainment Reporter
Dead Cells is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
8. Dietland
Image: amc
Based on Sarai Walker's book of the same name, Dietland is nothing if not a wild ride. A feminist battle cry that burned a little too bright (AMC canceled the show after just one season), Plum Kettle's journey towards self-acceptance and then domestic terrorism is bizarre, bumpy, and more than worth 10 hours of your time.  
""Dietland is an uncomfortable watch that feels shaky but necessary in todays media climate it feels important but difficult, in the same way that discussing the societal indignities piled on plus-sized women is a hard conversation for a lot of people to have,"" Mashable's Alexis Nedd said of the series. ""Luckily, Dietlands intentionally off-putting clash of flashbacks, animation, and casually cruel dialogue comes together in a 'what on earth am I watching and why cant I stop' kind of way.""
Dietland is streaming on Hulu.
7. The End of the F***ing World
Image: netflix
With what is most certainly the most appropriate title for anything in 2018, The End of the F***ing World is chicken soup for the nihilist's soul. A BBC expat, the British comedy is like the millennial version of Bonnie and Clyde. So instead of slick, criminal lovers, we've got two socially inept teens who feel too dead inside to care about the world.
Balancing comedy and sincerity, The End of the F***ing World speaks to the general sense that we're all so fucked we might as well laugh about it. But don't be fooled by its hardened, raunchy exterior. On the inside, this is a show with such a soft, vulnerable heart that you're probably a psychopath if you don't end up crying by the end. - Jess Joho, Entertainment Reporter
The End of the F***ing World is streaming on Netflix.
6. Thoroughbreds
Described by Mashable's Proma Khosla as ""expertly fucked-up,"" Thoroughbreds is a divisive, dark indie practically begging you to love it or hate it. 
Starring Olivia Cooke, Anya Taylor-Joy, and the late Anton Yelchin, Thoroughbreds comes to life with its killer performances and unmistakable ambiance. 
""Finley originally conceived his idea as a play, so Thoroughbreds operates on a micro level. The majority of scenes are just Amanda and Lily talking in a room, communicating as much with silence and glances as they do with their words,"" Khosla explains in her review of the film. ""Everything else is by design: the sterility of Lily's home, the space between them, Lyle Vincent's striking cinematography, and the sound not just an apoplectic score composed by Erik Friedlander intended less to shock than to rattle but sound editing and mixing that make you feel like your senses have been turned up to 11.""
Thoroughbreds is available for purchase with Prime Video.
5. Lovesick
Image: netflix
2018 kicked off with media outlets buzzing about Lovesick, a critical darling you shouldn't sleep on if only because it's charming as heck. Dylan starts contacting former partners after finding out he has chlamydia, but the show quickly gives you far more than its premise; it gives you emotional Dylan, broken Luke, fearful Evie even misguided Angus and creates a sweet, safe bubble. Lovesick belongs in the same conversations as New Girl, You're The Worst, and the ancestral Friends as a world we want to return to with friends that feel like our own. - Proma Khosla, Entertainment Reporter
Lovesick is streaming on Netflix. 
4. Florence 
The struggles of young adulthood have been portrayed in many games, but none has conveyed the intricacies of maturing quite like Florence. 
Created by the brilliant minds behind 2014's Monument Valley, this short animated mobile game introduces you to Florence Yeoh, a 25-year-old artist-turned-accountant. Players walk Florence through a series of chapters, each revealing more about her complicated feelings towards her adult life. She talks on the phone with her mother, she sketches in her notebook, and then she meets a handsome cellist named Krish.
Comprised of simple puzzles, Florence is an interactive story so beautiful and poetic that even non-gamers should consider giving it a download. Seriously, Florence is worth meeting. 
Florence is available on iOS and Android.
3. Kidding
Image: ERICA PARISE/SHOWTIME
""Kidding was an underrated gem in 2018 for reasons that arent entirely the shows fault. It aired after Shameless, which has fewer viewers in its gasping later seasons, and it aired on Showtime one of the less popular premium-type channels. The show is a masterwork of balancing tension with humor and has some of the flat out funniest lines of the year (shout out to Frank Langella for deadpanning you are a bagpipe of insanity at Jim Carrey in one of the mid-season episodes). Jim Carreys return to TV should have been big news, but hopefully Kiddings collection of Golden Globe nominations will garner a bigger audience for its second season."" -Alexis Nedd, Senior Entertainment Reporter
Kidding is streaming on Hulu.
2. The Ritual 
Image: Vlad Cioplea / netflix
The past twelve months have been jam-packed with excellent horror flicksso it's no wonder a few treasures got lost along the way. Tragically, this included David Bruckner's suspenseful masterpiece, The Ritual.
The Rafe Spall-starring nightmare received its UK theatrical release in late 2017, but didn't hit the mainstream until February of this year when it began streaming on Netflix. This story of four friends hiking through Sarek National Park (in this case, also know as the gaping mouth of hell) is one that benefits from its lack of publicity. If you can go into this film blind, then do. 
Skip the trailer. Press play. Dive in. Thank us after. 
The Ritual is streaming on Netflix.
1. Return of theObra Dinn
Described by Mashable's Jess Joho as ""more immediately gripping"" than Red Dead 2, Lucas Pope's Return of the Obra Dinn earned the title of Mashable's 2018 Game of the Year for reasons you'll have to play to believe.
Pope marketed the project as ""an insurance adventure with minimal color"" and that's a pretty major misdirect. In reality, it's the most intricately woven murder mystery in recent memory with an aesthetic style and gameplay mechanism you won't soon forget. 
""The brilliance of Obra Dinn lies in its expert withholding of information, doling out droplets of a non-chronological narrative told only in moments of suspended panic,"" Joho said of her experience with the game. ""It's the key to every well-told mystery, and this one never lets up on that tension.""
Return of the Obra Dinn is available on Windows and macOS.

"Jaclyn Youhana Garver on Offspring, shared by Jaclyn Youhana Garver to Lifehacker","True story: The title of the 8,011,991th U.S. Patent is Apparatus for Facilitating the Construction of a Snow Man/Woman, which certainly seems to imply that theres a right way to build a snowman, snowwoman, or snowperson.
But sometimes, no matter how much snow has fallen, you just cant get your Frosty, Olaf or Leon (you know, the snazzy snowman in Elf) right. Its body crumbles, or its head falls off or one section refuses to grow, no matter how much snow you add, resulting in less of a snowman and more of a snow baby doll.
Thats where science comes in. Different snowfalls have different physical properties, and knowing a bit about the physics of your snowballs will help, too.
Snow matters
Its not the size of the snowflake that matters so much as its moisture content. Snow comes in five categories based on the amount of free water relative to ice crystals, Dan Snowman (yes, that is his real name), a Rhode Island College in Providence physicist, told Smithsonian.com:
Dry snow, which has zero percent water
Moist now, which has less than three percent water
Wet snow, which is made up of three to eightpercent water
Very wet snow, made of eight to 15 percent water
Slush, which has more than 15 percent water
Try to make a snowman with dry snow, and it wont stick together. Use slush, and its like sculpting with water. The sweet spot you want is level two and three snow, Jordy Hendrikx, the director of the Snow and Avalanche Lab at Montana State University, told Smithsonian.com.
If youre not sure how to classify that blanket of white in your backyard, turn to the temperature. The best snowfall for snowperson-building occurs right around the freezing point, 32 degrees (bonus points for not having to freeze your tuchus off in two-degree snowfall).
Location, location, location
Once youve determined that youve got the right raw material for your snow masterpiece, you need to find the right spot to build. Here are some considerations:
 You want level ground, but avoid asphaltit absorbs sunlight, so your snowman is more likely to melt on your driveway.
A flat spot near the bottom of a hill will keep your snow person cool and away from the suns rays, but it might end up as sledder roadkill.
Your best bet, then, is on a flat portion of your yard, tucked close to the house to block the sun.
Shape matters
Theres a reason most of the snow people you see are made of spheres: Spheres are the best body shapes for a person made of snow, according to the Smithsonian:
Forming snowballs and packing the snow together exerts pressure on the ice crystals so that some melt during construction. After melting, the water will crystallize once again, binding together the snowball, Snowman notes.
Spheres will keep your snowman stable, and theyll also help it stick around longer: Spheres melt slower than other shapes because there is a minimal area exposed to sunlight.
Snowman also points out that the standard rule of stacking snowballslarge at the base, medium-sized in the middle, small for the headis the best way to keep your snow person upright. The lower the center of mass (the point at which you could balance the snowman horizontally on your finger) is to the ground, the better.
Size matters
Students at West Virginias Bluefield State College even came up with an ideal ratio for your snowman: from bottom to top, 3:2:1but be sure to avoid making your snowballs too big. 
There may be an upper limit to the size of the spheres, related to the water content of the snow. As the snowball grows, it is more difficult to apply pressure to adequately pack, says Snowman. This potentially results in an unstable structure for Frostys body parts and may result in catastrophic failure.","True story: The title of the 8,011,991th U.S. Patent is “Apparatus for Facilitating the Construction of a Snow Man/Woman,” which certainly seems to imply that there’s a right way to build a snowman, snowwoman, or snowperson.

The Canadian Press,"DENVER Gabriel Landeskog got the chance to celebrate his goal a second time after a big sigh of relief.
He thought his score would count despite a challenge for goaltender interference. But really he wasn't sure. It's hard to be completely sure.
The Colorado captain broke a tie 35 seconds into the third period by batting in a goal, Philipp Grubauer stopped 35 shots and the Avalanche beat the Montreal Canadiens 2-1 on Wednesday night.
""It was one of those that could have gone either way,"" Landeskog said.
That's what infuriated goaltender Carey Price and the Canadiens.
This is how the play unfolded: Landeskog's initial shot bounced off the chest of Price and the forward knocked it in out of midair as he and Montreal's Jonathan Drouin crashed into Price. Landeskog celebrated as the Canadiens challenged that it was goaltender interference. The goal was upheld on replay and Landeskog celebrated again by tossing down his water bottle in exuberance.
""I disagree with the call,"" Price said.
His coach had his back.
""It's 50-50 now,"" said Claude Julien, who coached his 300th game with Montreal. ""Anytime we challenge a call, we know we say, 'We're tossing a coin here.' We have no idea how they're going to call it.
""What we saw was the initial collision was Landeskog and our goaltender, which if there's not that collision, he freezes the puck. They can look at the second one and say our guy pushed our goaltender even further, but that's after the original collision. That's why our goaltender doesn't agree with the call. That's why I support him on that.""
Price is even more confused about the rule.
""I don't know what it is. I just think if your ability is impeded to make a move to the puck I think it's pretty clear,"" said Price, whose team started a six-game trip that's broken up by the holiday break. ""They had a different opinion on the contact.""
Mikko Rantanen had a goal and an assist to give him an NHL-leading 58 points. He's followed by teammate Nathan MacKinnon, who has 55 points after a two-assist evening. Landeskog, the third member of their high-flying line, scored his team-best 23rd goal.
Price, who stopped 24 shots, came up short in his bid for his 300th career victory. He's trying to become the 35th goaltender to reach that milestone.
Brendan Gallagher had a power-play goal for Montreal, breaking the Canadiens' 0 for 25 dry spell with the man advantage.
Grubauer only got stronger throughout the night in improving to 8-0-3 over his last 11 starts. He started in place of a struggling Semyon Varlamov.
""I just felt (Grubauer) looked really solid in the net, like he was in control of the game,"" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. ""I haven't felt that way about our goaltending for the last little bit, and that's what we need. We need those guys to take control of it and to be real sharp and on top of their game and give us a chance to sort of find ourselves.""
Trailing 1-0 early in the second, Colorado capitalized on a mistake by Price. He tried to play the puck to the side had it intercepted by MacKinnon, who dished it over to Rantanen for the goal.
""I just tried to yell for Nate and he made a quick pass and Price couldn't recover,"" Rantanen said. ""It was a good play by Nate.""
With two goals and three assists, Colorado's top line of Landeskog, MacKinnon and Rantanen have now amassed a combined 155 points. Asked if that unit proved difficult to contain, Julien pointed out that one of their scores was off a turnover and the other a disputed goal.
""I don't think they burned us,"" Julien said. ""If anything, our guys played well against them.""

Benjamin Brown,"Some hikers in Oregon recently found 19 dead elk, which state Fish and Wildlife officials say were likely the victims of an avalanche. The hikers made the discovery last week near No Name Lake and Broken Top mountain peak, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said. Melting snow revealed the elk carcasses, which included bulls, cows and calves, wildlife biologist Jamie Bowles said, according to the Bulletin of Bend, Ore. “It was really unsettling to see in person,” Bowles told the paper. The elk suffered broken limbs and antlers, as well as torn hides from the avalanche. Their bodies were also twisted and contorted. Bowles said it was not clear when the avalanche took place, but believes it was likely last summer after the winter of 2016-17, when the area had a record amount of snowfall. The wildlife biologist told the paper that, based on the regions researchers have been able to study, it is rare for elk to get trapped in avalanches, however, he noted it could be taking place in more remote areas. Bowles said the elk will not be removed as it is unnecessary and too dangerous. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Benjamin Brown is a reporter for Fox News.

"AP, AP","Carolina Hurricanes' Jordan Staal (11) shoves the Colorado Avalanche's Mikko Rantanen (96), of Finland, to the ice during the first period of an NHL hockey game in Raleigh, N.C., Saturday, Oct. 20, 2018. (AP Photo/Chris Seward) (Photo: The Associated Press) DENVER (AP) Bottom line: Gabriel Landeskog, Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen form the top line in the league. Numbers-wise, anyway. Perception-wise, their reputation is rapidly rising, too. The Colorado Avalanche's top unit has a combined 55 points so far this season. That's the most points of any three teammates in the NHL, regardless of line. As for the unit next to them, it would be Boston's trio of Patrice Bergeron, David Pastrnak and Brad Marchand with 44 points. Landeskog recently took a hardline stance when asked about the topic of top line combinations, telling the home crowd in a TV interview after a win that his fast-flying squad was indeed the best in the league. ""A fun line to watch,"" Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper recently said. ""You pre-scout the games and you take your opposing coach hat off and just admire their line."" It all starts with MacKinnon, the All-Star center who's considered one of the speediest skaters in the league. He's so quick his fellow linemates worked diligently in the offseason in order to not only keep up with him but to stay ahead of everyone else in hockey. Landeskog resorted to pushing around a heavy sled in workouts to get more explosive on the ice. At 6-foot-1, 215 pounds, he's trying to find the right balance to be physical in the corners but still stay swift. The early results are in: The Avalanche captain appears a step faster. ""Passing the eye test is half the battle,"" cracked the 25-year-old Landeskog, who has 10 goals and six assists. ""I feel good, no doubt. I feel really good."" Rantanen has been on track all season thanks, in part, to his offseason track sessions. Two times a week, Rantanen would head to a track in Finland for the same sort of workout: Sprints of 20 and 30 meters over and over. The workouts were no more than 40 minutes, but the high-intensity drills did the trick. ""I feel better on the ice. My first couple of steps, I feel faster,"" said Rantanen, who turned 22 on Monday and leads the league in points with five goals and 16 assists. ""I think there are still things I can work on and maybe get better next year. But I definitely think I'm faster than last year."" MacKinnon looks like he's taken his game to an even higher level, which isn't an easy endeavor given a 97-point season in 2017-18. His 18 points (nine goals, nine assists) are ahead of his pace from last season, when he didn't reach this kind of point production until mid-November. ""Keep doing what I'm doing,"" said the 23-year-old MacKinnon, whose team is tied for the most points in the Western Conference after 12 games (7-3-2, 16 points). ""Keep getting better with the little things. Just be very consistent every night."" When they're clicking, games like this are possible: A combined 10 points in a 6-3 win over Ottawa on Friday. That sort of offensive production certainly left an impression on the Senators. ""They do everything right. They cycle the puck, they don't make turnovers at the top of the blue line and they get everything low,"" Senators right winger Bobby Ryan said. ""They attack from a lot of different angles. They keep you guessing."" Colorado coach Jared Bednar assembled the Landeskog, MacKinnon and Rantanen line late last October and they averaged around three points per game. So far this season, it's jumped to 4.6. ""They're all coming into their own,"" former Avalanche and current Senators forward Matt Duchene said. ""I look at a guy like Mikko and the steps he's taken. They're unbelievable. I mean, that's a line you've got to contain."" In Bednar's estimation, his top line's exploits boil down to one thing: a willingness to pass just as much as shoot. It makes them that much harder to defend. ""All three of them see the ice really well,"" said Bednar, whose first line accounts for 50 percent of the team's points. ""The one other thing that doesn't get talked about a lot is just the hunger all three of those guys have to move themselves forward in their careers and move our team forward. That's important."" Although the top unit in Boston generates plenty of headlines for its play, the trio in Colorado is starting to get their fair share of attention around hockey circles, too. Landeskog was the league's first star last week and Rantanen was named the league's third star on Monday. ""It's fun,"" Landeskog said. ""At the same time, you take the good with the bad. You know how tough it can be at times when things aren't going your way. So you have to enjoy it while you can."" ___ For more NHL coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"AP, AP","Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Anton Forsberg (31) makes a save on Colorado Avalanche left wing J.T. Compher (37) during the first period of an NHL hockey game Tuesday, March 20, 2018, in Chicago. (AP Photo/David Banks) (Photo: The Associated Press) CHICAGO (AP) — Nathan MacKinnon had two assists, extending his point streak to a career high-tying 13 games, and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Chicago Blackhawks 5-1 on Tuesday night. Alexander Kerfoot scored twice and Semyon Varlamov made 44 saves as Colorado won for the fifth time in six games and improved to 8-1-3 in their last 12. Mikko Rantanen and Tyson Barrie each had a goal and an assist, and Erik Johnson added an empty-netter. The Avalanche (40-25-8) snapped a tie with Anaheim for the top spot in the Western Conference wild-card race and moved within two points of Minnesota for third place in the Central Division. Chicago (30-35-9) lost for the sixth time in seven games. Defenseman Brent Seabrook scored his fifth goal of the season for the Blackhawks, and Anton Forsberg made 35 stops in his first start since he was pulled in the first period of Thursday night's 6-2 loss at Winnipeg. The last-place Blackhawks were eliminated from postseason contention with the loss. They had made the playoffs in nine straight seasons, winning three Stanley Cups. Seabrook's power-play goal put Chicago in front with 4:15 left in the first period, but Colorado responded with three in the second. With Andreas Martinsen in the box for slashing, a wide-open Kerfoot jumped on a rebound and beat Forsberg from the slot at 2:07. Kerfoot snapped a 14-game drought with his 16th of the season. The Avalanche then grabbed a 2-1 lead on their next shot. MacKinnon drew Forsberg over to one side of the net before playing it across to Rantanen for the easy one-timer at 5:01. Rantanen extended his point streak to seven games. The 21-year-old forward is tied with MacKinnon for most points in the NHL in March with 20 apiece. Rantanen and MacKinnon each picked up an assist when Barrie scored from the high slot on another power play, making it 3-1 at 12:40. Barrie extended his career-best point streak to 11 games, the longest run for an Avalanche defenseman since the franchise moved to Colorado. Chicago had three more power-play chances in the third, but came up empty each time. Johnson scored from the other end of the ice at 18:04, and Kerfoot made it 5-1 when he beat Forsberg with 57 seconds remaining. NOTES: MacKinnon has 13 goals and 13 assists during his point streak....

"AP, AP","Pittsburgh Penguins' Sidney Crosby (87) upends Colorado Avalanche's Samuel Girard (49) as they battle in front of goaltender Semyon Varlamov (1) during the first period of an NHL hockey game in Pittsburgh, Tuesday, Dec. 4, 2018. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (Photo: The Associated Press) PITTSBURGH (AP) Patric Hornqvist's natural hat trick in the third period powered the Pittsburgh Penguins past the Colorado Avalanche 6-3 on Tuesday night. The Avalanche had erased a three-goal deficit to tie the game going into the third when Hornqvist went to work. His power-play goal 6:11 into the final period gave the Penguins the lead. Hornqvist beat Semyon Varlamov again just 1:21 later to push Pittsburgh's advantage to two, and the veteran from Sweden completed the hat trick on his next shift when he fired a wrist shot by Varlamov less than 90 seconds later. Jake Guentzel, Evgeni Malkin and Derick Brassard also scored for the Penguins, who halted Colorado's 11-game point streak. Kris Letang added two assists for Pittsburgh. Casey DeSmith finished with 42 saves. Tyson Barrie, Carl Soderberg and Matt Nieto scored for the Avalanche, who saw their six-game road win streak snapped. Varlamov made 26 stops, but struggled early and late. Penguins captain Sidney Crosby and Colorado star Nathan MacKinnon, good friends and frequent training partners in the offseason, put together a thrilling duel in Colorado last week, with MacKinnon's four points able to help the Avalanche overcome a natural hat trick by Crosby in a 6-3 Avalanche victory. The two stars went scoreless in the rematch, taking a backseat to Hornqvist. The Penguins needed just 7:27 to build a three-goal lead. Guentzel redirected a feed from Letang with his left skate just 2:46 in. Malkin followed just over four minutes later when he jammed home a shot from the point by Tanner Pearson for his first five-on-five goal since Oct. 30. Brassard beat Varlamov 35 seconds later and Colorado's hot streak appeared to be in serious jeopardy. Pittsburgh then caught a break when a goal by Colorado's J.T. Compher was overturned on a coach's challenge when officials ruled Soderberg interfered with DeSmith. Still, the Avalanche managed to fire 18 shots at DeSmith in the opening 20 minutes, a hint at the flurry to come as Pittsburgh's seemingly comfortable advantage vanished in a span of 5:01. Barrie's power-play shot from the point 8:16 into the second gave the Avalanche momentum. Ian Cole, playing in Pittsburgh for the first time since helping the Penguins win consecutive Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017, fired a knuckler toward the net that Soderberg managed to get a stick on and deflect past DeSmith. Nieto found a gap with the Penguins on the power play to slip the puck by DeSmith to tie the game, the seventh short-handed goal allowed by Pittsburgh this season. Hornqvist, one of the best net-front players in the league, collected a Letang rebound, spun around and whipped a shot by Varlamov 6:11 into the third to start a burst that ended with hats raining down from the sell-out crowd, and Colorado's attempt to match the franchise record for consecutive road wins set during the 1998-99 season was over.

The new map — created using data collected by the Gaia satellite — shows about 1.7 billion stars, including many objects never seen before, according to the European Space Agency (ESA), which runs Gaia. SEE ALSO: Thousands of previously unseen black holes lurk near the center of our galaxy The catalogue represents almost two years of sky charting. “The observations collected by Gaia are redefining the foundations of astronomy,” Günther Hasinger, ESA Director of Science, said in a statement. “Gaia is an ambitious mission that relies on a huge human collaboration to make sense of a large volume of highly complex data.” The new map of the sky builds on Gaia's first map, which was released in 2016 after about a year of observations. It came complete with 2 millions stars, according to the ESA. The 2018 map is quite an upgrade. “The second Gaia data release represents a huge leap forward,"" Gaia researcher Anthony Brown said, referring to previous space-based attempts to measure the distances and positions of stars in our galaxy. For example, ESA's Hipparcos satellite, ""surveyed some 118,000 stars almost 30 years ago,” Brown added, so Gaia marks a giant leap forward for this kind of work.

Jeff Paterson,"If the Vancouver Canucks (27-28-8) hope to keep their playoff hopes alive, they have to find a way to beat the Colorado Avalanche (27-24-12) tonight at Pepsi Center. The Avs are one of two teams between the Canucks and the playoff bar in the National Hockey Leagues Western Conference. Colorado heads into the game with 66 points while the Canucks have 62. Dallas currently holds down the second wild card spot with 67 points.
Its the start of a three-game road trip for the Canucks who will also make stops in Arizona and Las Vegas. The team is looking to string consecutive victories together for the first time since January 18th and 20th against Buffalo and Detroit. The Canucks took the first step in that direction with a 4-0 shutout win over Anaheim on Monday night. Jacob Markstrom made 29 saves to record his first shutout of the season. He will return to the net tonight and start for a 20th time in the teams last 22 games.
Mondays win was Markstroms 71st as a member of the Vancouver Canucks. His next win will move him into a tie with Gary Smith for fifth on the franchises list of all-time goalie victories behind Roberto Luongo (252), Kirk McLean (211), Richard Brodeur (126) and Dan Cloutier (109).
Bo Horvat scored twice giving him a career-high 23 goals on the season. His first of the night was his first power play goal since December 20th. With a goal last week against Arizona, Horvat now has three goals in his past three games.
Nikolay Goldobin opened the scoring against the Ducks. It was his first goal since the last time the club was in Denver on February 2nd. As a team, the Canucks victory on Monday was their first regulation win since beating the Avs 5-1 more than three weeks ago.
Veteran defenseman Luke Schenn logged 15:07 in his first NHL game since November 9th. He had three shots on goal and a team-high four hits on Monday.
Newcomer Tanner Pearson acquired from Pittsburgh for Erik Gudbranson on Monday skated with his new team for the first time this morning and will debut alongside Elias Pettersson and Brock Boeser tonight. Adam Gaudette is ill and did not accompany the team to Colorado, so Markus Granlund slides to the middle on a line with Antoine Roussel and Nikolay Goldobin.
Alex Edler took part in the teams gameday skate in Denver, but will not play tonight. He is a possibility for tomorrow nights game in Phoenix. The Canucks will go with the same six defensemen they used on Monday meaning veteran Luke Schenn stays in the line-up and will be paired with Ashton Sautner.
The Avalanche get back to work after falling 4-3 in overtime at home to Florida on Monday night. Tyson Jost, Mikko Rantanen and newcomer Derick Brassard scored the Colorado goals while Semyon Varlamov made 34 saves in goal.
The Avs jumped out to a 2-0 second period lead and held a 3-2 edge with less than 10 minutes to play in the third, but couldnt secure the victory. The game was the league-leading 12th time this season Colorado has had to settle for a single point. With the game-breaking talent they possess, the Avs are an unbelievable 1-11 in overtime on the season and 0-1 in the shootout.
Mondays loss snapped a four-game win streak during which the Avs had outscored Western Conference rivals Vegas, Winnipeg, Chicago and Nashville 20-4. The Avs have picked up points in five straight (4-0-1) and nine of their last 11 games (5-2-4).
Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen are tied for the team scoring lead and tied for fourth NHL scoring with 80 points apiece while captain Gabriel Landeskog leads the team with 33 goals. MacKinnon is one behind and leads the league with 276 shots on goal this season.
As a team, Colorado sits ninth overall in goals scored (209) and tied for eighth on the power play (22.2%).
Ahead of Mondays trade deadline, the Avs acquired Derick Brassard from Florida for a 2020 third round draft pick. Brassard is on his third team this season after starting the year in Pittsburgh where he was teammates with Tanner Pearson. Colorado is now Brassards sixth NHL home after previous stops in Columbus, with the New York Rangers and in Ottawa.
Since the All-Star break, the Canucks and Avs have both struggled on the power play with each team scoring four times with the man-advantage. Vancouver is 4/38 (10.5%) in that time while Colorado is 4/43 (9.3%).
The Canucks have defeated the Avs in both previous meetings this season. Elias Pettersson had five points and Derrick Pouliot scored the overtime winner on a power play in a wild 7-6 victory in Vancouver on November 2nd. Five different Canucks scored in a 5-1 win here in Denver in the first game for both teams out of the All-Star break on February 2nd.

"AP, AP","Carolina Hurricanes' Justin Williams (14) tries to pass the puck through the legs of Colorado Avalanche's Erik Johnson (6) as Hurricanes' Sebastian Aho (20) waits nearby during the second period of an NHL hockey game, Saturday, Feb. 10, 2018, in Raleigh, N.C. (AP Photo/Karl B DeBlaker) (Photo: The Associated Press) RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Hurricanes coach Bill Peters wants his team to see the big picture and not just focus on the playoff standings. Brock McGinn scored twice to lead the Hurricanes to a 3-1 win over the Colorado Avalanche on Saturday night. Jeff Skinner also scored, Elias Lindholm had two assists and Cam Ward stopped 29 shots to help Carolina remain one point ahead of Columbus for the second wild card in the Eastern Conference. ""I'd rather be playing well and not care if I'm in by one or out by two,"" Peters said. ""I'd rather be playing well and building toward something. That's what we're doing."" McGinn tied the score with just over three minutes left in the first period and gave the Hurricanes the lead 35 seconds into the third. Skinner capped the scoring with 6:43 left as Carolina, seeking its first playoff appearance since 2009, won its second straight after a three-game skid. ""It was definitely a big win for us, coming off of a couple of losses,"" McGinn said. ""We just want to build on it going forward."" Ward said it's difficult to not keep up with the other teams in the wild-card race and in the Metropolitan Division. ""Every day, everybody is looking at the standings,"" Ward said. ""You've got to take care of business right now. You can't wait until you've got 10 games left."" Tyson Barrie scored for Colorado and Semyon Varlamov finished with 32 saves. The Avalanche, playing without leading scorer Nathan MacKinnon for a fifth straight game due to a shoulder injury, fell four points behind Minnesota for the second wild card in the West. Ward made six saves on the penalty kill in the second period after right wing Teuvo Teravainen took two penalties, about 4 minutes apart. The second, for high-sticking, drew blood on Colorado center J.T. Compher and gave the Avalanche a 4-minute power play. The Avs, who entered the game with the NHL's worst power-play unit on the road, couldn't convert with the extended opportunity. McGinn's second goal looked a lot like his first with Lindholm, who was behind the net, setting him up in the slot. Colorado struck first with a goal by Barrie with 3:09 left in the first. Mikko Rantanen set it up with a takeway behind the Hurricanes' net and then found Barrie in the slot, and the defenseman beat Ward high. The Hurricanes evened it up 18 seconds later when McGinn beat Varlamov with a quick wrist shot. There are 26 games left for Carolina. As Peters pointed out, that's a lot of hockey, but if Carolina can play the way it has the past couple of games, it might have a chance to end its long playoff drought. ""We have to do it right each and every night,"" Peters said. ""We know how to play and when we're committed to doing it the right way, we get positive results.""

Andrew Couts,"On the internet, a week is a lifetime—especially when it’s the opening week of Avengers: Infinity War. Unlike seemingly everyone else, I’ve yet to see the Marvel blockbuster, an admission that is likely enough to inspire my colleagues at io9 to greet me at my desk in the morning with pitchforks. It also means running from anything that even smells like a spoiler. So I can tell you right now—nothing in this post is an Infinity War spoiler. If, instead, the drama you’re still getting caught up on is the Cambridge Analytica scandal, well, I have some bad news. On Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica employees learned that its parent company, the SCL Group, was shuttering the business, with American-based workers directed to return their keycards immediately, according to documentation reviewed by Gizmodo. The news was announced during a conference call led by Julian Wheatland, the current chairman of the SCL Group who was reportedly tapped to take over as Cambridge Analytica’s next CEO. Both Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections (the SCL Group subsidiary connected to Cambridge Analytica) will now close their doors. It’s been six months since the iPhone X release, and one thing holds true: It’s still expensive. However, as much as I hated myself for buying a $1,000 phone, and as much as I hated myself for loving it, spending half a year with the iPhone X has revealed some new truths. One, Jony Ive is right when he says Face ID is more important than it seems. Two, Apple’s grasp on excellent quality control is slipping. Three, once you’ve fallen in love with the iPhone X, there’s no turning back. Dread it. Run from it. Avengers: Infinity War is finally here, bringing with it all sorts of questions about just what comes next for the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the wake of Thanos’ true arrival. Need some answers? Well, we have a few, as well as some extra questions about what happens now... I was crawling around on the floor, chasing my cat, Avalanche, as she artfully wriggled away from me over and over again to gnaw at the piece of tape I had stuck to her gray and white fur. Avalanche had unwittingly become a victim of journalistic inquiry: I wanted to explore the latest fad in consumer DNA testing, genetic analysis for pets. But rather than somehow coax my cat to spit in a tube, Basepaws required that I stick a piece of tape to Avalanche’s body, then “gently” pull it off. Except it turns out that there is no way to gently rip tape off of an animal completely covered in two-inch-long fur. My cat was furious with me for hours. Do not be me. I was desperate for a new Apple laptop to replace my dying 2012 one and as soon as the 2016 Macbook Pro with Touch Bar was available to buy I ordered it. This was a major redesign for Apple, and experience with other products told me that buying the first generation of a new laptop would be a very bumpy ride. I did it anyways. There was regret. With the recent worldwide release of Avengers: Infinity War, many comic book fans spent the weekend processing the movie’s grand implications on the larger Marvel universe. Perhaps the most surprising revelation of all, however, isn’t being discussed in forum posts or on social media. Hidden among the movie’s numerous crossover characters is one passing cameo that connects to Adam West’s Batman, suggesting he’s the canonical Dark Knight of the Marvel movies. I know it sounds nuts, but just hear me out. Some Infinity War and St. Elsewhere spoilers follow. Mark Zuckerberg may have ditched the dark suit he wore during his congressional appearances last month, but the serious data-privacy and election-security issues raised during his testimony are still very much on his mind. Zuckerberg said it to members of the House and Senate in mid-April and repeated it to a convention center packed with developers this week: Facebook can—and must—do better. “What I’ve learned this year is that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility. It’s not enough to just build powerful tools, we need to make sure that they’re used for good. And we will,” Zuckerberg said. He highlighted user privacy repeatedly during a keynote address at the social media giant’s F8 developers conference, working it into his discussion of Facebook’s new dating platform, cookie-clearing tool, and video chat features. But it’s obvious that Zuckerberg wants to move beyond his company’s scandals—even though, with the midterm elections on the horizon, it’s more important than ever that Facebook prepare itself for an onslaught of misinformation and data harvesting. Every year, the bold and the brave make a pilgrimage here to California’s remote Tehachapi Mountains for Grindfest, a weekend dedicated to the merger of man and machine. Grinders are hackers, but the hardware they aim to hack is the human body. They are transhumanist in the most literal sense. Grinders want to transcend human form. For many grinders, that means augmenting their bodies with cybernetic components—becoming cyborgs. I came to Grindfest curious about how those on the extreme fringes of body hacking were incorporating technology into their lives and bodies. By the time the weekend was over, I had my own RFID chip implant—a small, potentially powerful electronic lump under the skin of my right hand. When you play one of Janelle Monáe’s albums, you aren’t just taking a winding tour through the musical influences that have shaped the artist’s intoxicating, soul-piercing voice. You’re tapping into a part of an expansive Afrofuturist saga about identity, revolution, time travel, and (of course) androids. Less than a week has passed since the first standalone VR headset was released, and already we have another. Except this one is made by Lenovo in partnership with Google and uses the Daydream VR platform. Like the Oculus Go, Lenovo’s Mirage Solo don’t need no phone or a wire connected to a nearby PC to transport you to other worlds. Everything you need comes built into the goggles. But Lenovo didn’t stop there because in addition to having a highest resolution display, the Mirage Solo supports Google’s WorldSense tech, so you can bob-and-weave through VR at speed, without a hint of lag, something that’s much more difficult for the Oculus Go to do. And then, Lenovo even went and made a dedicated VR camera to help people create VR-ready content more easily. All together, this is a big play to make new kind of VR stand out, so did it actually work? In a scientific first, researchers have used an MRI scanner to study the brains of Nile crocodiles. Sounds weird—and even a bit dangerous—but the experiment is revealing new insights into the evolution of brains and how mammals and birds acquired the capacity to comprehend complex sounds. Our brains are the product of millions of years of evolution. Scientists would very much like to know how some of the most ancient brains functioned and evolved over time, but that’s obviously not possible, owing to the complete lack of primordial brains to work with. As a good consolation prize, however, scientists can work with crocodiles—an animal that originated more than 200 million years ago, barely changing over the eons. Accordingly, scientists can study crocodiles to understand at which point certain brain structures and behaviors first emerged.","On the internet, a week is a lifetime—especially when it’s the opening week of Avengers: Infinity War.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Should you put all of your discretionary money toward paying off your debt, or is it OK to splurge on something you’ve been eyeing? That’s what we’re discussing this week. Each Monday we’re tackling one of your pressing personal finance questions by asking a handful of money experts for their advice. If you have a general question or money concern, or just want to talk about something PeFi-related, leave it in the comments or email me at alicia.adamczyk@lifehacker.com. This week’s question comes from Ceaser: I bought a $200 pair of shoes recently, on a rough and hectic day. Is that too much to pay for a spell of happiness, especially when you have debt and student loans? I make all of my payments on time, or early. I do feel guilt, because I think about what else that money could have gone to, but then I remember it’s just money and it’s going to be spent anyway, so why not spend it on something that I’ll enjoy?﻿ This is what individual experts have to say generally about an issue that affects each person differently—if you want personalized advice you should see a financial planner. It’s Your Money and Your Financial Future Obviously putting an extra $200 toward your debt rather than another pair of sneakers would have been the financially responsible thing to do, a fact you clearly understand and are grappling with. But you can give yourself a break in this case. Even the most frugal amongst us slip up now and then, and while you shouldn’t make a habit of buying expensive shoes every time you have a bad day, getting swept up in guilt will likely only make you feel worse. And feeling like crap isn’t a great motivator, in my experience. It’s an interesting (read: damaging) reality of American life, that we promote consumerism in every form and yet shame each other for buying things we don’t “need” when we have debts to pay or are living paycheck-to-paycheck. We equate our worth and morality, to a certain extent, with our ability to have a top-notch credit score and zero debt, maxing out our retirement contributions each year and having a well-stocked emergency fund. It’s the same mentality that reasons you should stop buying iPhones if you want health care or that not tipping your server will somehow lead to a better, more equitable wage environment in the restaurant industry. But having debt doesn’t mean you’re precluded from enjoying frivolous things, or that you should be plagued by guilt for every penny you spend that’s not going toward some “essential.” So you have debt. You’re making the payments—sometimes early—and that’s the important thing. Yes, any bit extra could help dig you out faster, but there’s something to be said for treating ourselves. We all deserve a bouquet of flowers or new pair of shoes every now and then, to be enjoyed without guilt or shame. We all deserve to have stuff that simply brings us joy. You’ve got questions, we’ve got answers. Each Monday we’ll tackle one of your pressing personal… Read more Read Curbing Our Spending Impulses But if impulse spending really does bother you—maybe it’s the reason you have some of that debt to begin with—there are a few strategies you can use to avoid doing it: Understand your triggers. You said you had a rough day, so you bought the shoes. Is that something that happens often? Is there another outlet you can use instead of online shopping when the going gets tough? Next time, rather than perusing your shopping list, try taking a walk or writing complaints in a journal (my preferred method of coping) to clear your head. Buying stuff any time we feel like it has never been easier, but ask yourself if you really need it, particularly if doing so will cause you to feel guilty afterwards. Next, consider your other financial goals. Maybe that $200 didn’t need to go toward your debt repayment, but are there other things that are important to you (say, saving for a vacation or owning a house someday) that you don’t tend to consider when you’re opening emails from your favorite stores? Consider those goals next time you go to buy something impulsively. Most importantly, make sure you have a plan in place to pay off your debt ( snowball or avalanche, or another that you’ve created yourself). If you’re comfortable with your debt repayment plan, you’re investing a little bit and you’re not digging yourself deeper in the hole, buying a pricey pair of shoes doesn’t spell disaster for your financial future. And enjoy your new shoes. They’re going to look great on you.","Should you put all of your discretionary money toward paying off your debt, or is it OK to splurge on something you’ve been eyeing?

Billy Perrigo,"One skier has died and another is in hospital with critical injuries after an avalanche on Thursday at a ski resort in New Mexico.
Both men were pulled from the snow alive at Taos Ski Valley, but one later died from his injuries, Holy Cross Hospital confirmed to the Taos News. Neither of the victims has yet been identified.
The avalanche, which came off the Kachina peak in the north of the state at 11:30 a.m. local time, was not thought to have injured any others.
Rescuers were on the scene within minutes, according to a spokesperson. “The ski patrol and nearby witnesses immediately responded to the scene and rescued two skiers who had been buried by snow,” said Chris Stagg, the vice president of Taos Ski Valley, Inc., in a statement.
The rescue, which took around 20 minutes, used “the latest avalanche response protocol,” according to Stagg. After carrying on to be sure there were no other victims, the search was called off after 2 p.m.
“Avalanche mitigation work has been taking place throughout the season and as recently as this morning in the area that the avalanche occurred,” he said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the two individuals who were affected by today’s event and their families.”
An eyewitness who spoke to Taos News described the avalanche as sounding like an earthquake. “I see two people trying to come down and a third person on the left. They were really good skiers it looked like,” she said. “I turned my back to put my bindings on … and then I heard a sound. It sounded like an earthquake coming.”
The news comes just days after an avalanche killed three German skiers and left a fourth missing in Austria.

Tom Marks,"id Software is working with Avalanche to make sure Rage 2 still feels like an id game. By Tom Marks Speaking to IGN at QuakeCon 2018, developer Avalanche Studios explained that they were the primary developer on Rage 2, the sequel developed in collaboration with id Software. “We at Avalanche are making the game,” said Avalanche game Director Magnus Nedfors. He told me that id has been working closely with them on the creative level “since day one,” but that “we have written the code, we have made the art and that stuff -- that part of development is made in Stockholm by Avalanche.” “It’s a close collaboration still with the people at id, learning from them when it comes to the shooting and so on,” Nedfors said. That influence is clear, as the guns and the pace of Rage 2 feel very similar to Doom. “They’ve taught us a lot about the id-style of combat,” he explained, saying id studio director Tim Willits wanted to make sure that Rage 2’s shooting still felt like an id game. They’ve taught us a lot about the id-style of combat. Nedfors said that Bethesda and Avalanche had been in contact for years looking for a project they could work on together. Then Bethesda reached out asking if they’d be interested in making a sequel to Rage, and Nedfors recalled, “we were like ‘yeah, that would be f***ing awesome.’ I was super stoked from day one.” “They were super good to work with in the beginning, because they didn’t come and say ‘we want this game,’” Nedfors explained. “I think it was kind of the other way around, like ‘hey, what would you do if you got the opportunity to make a sequel to Rage?’ And they kind of handed it over to us, and we could build up our ideas before they showed any of their stuff.” Nedfors said they had the creative freedom to say “this is what we would like to do,” and that their vision “matched really well” to what id was thinking as well.

Techbriefs Media Group,"Billy Hurley, Digital Editorial Manager Simulation is a helpful go-to tool for assessing risk, but what if the event being simulated is an avalanche – a complex event with countless parameters and physical variables? Johan Gaume, a researcher at Switzerland’s EPFL Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences (CRYOS) and the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, took up the challenge. We were not only able to make avalanches ""look good,"" but the model was also validated using real-world data. — Johan Gaume With input from Gaume and a team of mathematicians, the highly accurate digital simulation offers insight into the workings of an avalanche – information that will help to improve forecasting and hazard management in snow-covered, mountainous regions. And did you know much of the simulation inspiration came from a Disney movie? Gaume spoke with Tech Briefs spoke about how he and his collaborators at UCLA were able to digitally recreate a massive slide of snow. Tech Briefs: Why is an avalanche so challenging to simulate? Johan Gaume: An avalanche is very complicated to simulate because snow is an extremely complex material whose mechanical behavior is not fully understood yet. In addition, we focused on snow slab avalanches, which are not only the most destructive but also the most complex avalanches involving challenging crack propagation mechanisms. Finally, up to now, we lacked a unified numerical framework able to simulate both the initiation and the flow of the avalanche at the slope scale. Johan Gaume, avalanche expert at EPFL and SLF. (Image Credit: A.Herzog/EPFL) Tech Briefs: How does your simulation approach differ from traditional methods? Gaume: Traditional methods focus either on the release or on the flow of the avalanche, independently. Here, we are able to simulate the whole avalanche process in a unified manner. In particular, we are able to evaluate – for the first time – the position and volume of the release zone, which is required in operational risk management procedures. Furthermore, we were able to reproduce very well the so-called process of ""anticrack"" propagation in weak snowpack layers which is at the origin of snow slab avalanches. This process refers to the collapse of the very porous weak layer which is buried below the snow slab, similar to the collapse of a house of cards. ( Learn more about the simulation method at EPFL.) Tech Briefs: What inspired this work? Gaume: This work was largely inspired by the snow model developed initially for the movie Frozen. When I first saw the movie, I was amazed by the realism of snow deformation and failure. I thus contacted Prof. Joseph Teran, a mathematician at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) who was involved in the Frozen snow simulations. He was very motivated by the idea of extending the model to avalanches, and I submitted a proposal to get funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation, to go to LA and work with his team and colleagues: Dr. Ted Gast at UCLA and Prof. Chenfanfu Jiang at UPenn. Tech Briefs: How was your science background helpful to this effort? Gaume: My background is mostly in Solid and Fluid Mechanics, and I apply it to model snow and avalanches, but so far using rather simple approaches. It was really the combination between the skills and talent of the UCLA and UPenn mathematicians in numerical modeling and my knowledge in snow and avalanche mechanics which led to the success of this collaboration. We were not only able to make avalanches ""look good,"" but the model was also validated using real-world data from the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF. NASA's Simulation Application See how software is helping NASA to simulate the performance of the James Webb Telescope. Tech Briefs: Can this type of simulation be used in other applications? Gaume: Beyond avalanche forecasting and risk management, our simulations could be used in Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) for movies or video games for example. In general, the powder-cloud is quite well simulated in movies of avalanches (or a volcano's pyroclastic flow), but the initiation of the avalanche could be significantly improved using our approach. Finally, I think this work has interesting applications in other domains such as landslides, debris-flows, rockfall, and more generally, simulation of granular materials. Tech Briefs: What’s most exciting to you about this research? Gaume: Personally, the most exciting part was the collaboration and working with extremely talented mathematicians. I was impressed by how fast they could turn a new physical process into mathematical equations. I learned a lot at UCLA! For the work itself, being able to simulate an entire avalanche in 3D on a realistic terrain is definitely the most exciting. Tech Briefs: What’s next? Gaume: Now we would like to simulate avalanches based on real topography and snow cover properties in order to validate it with real-scale measurements of avalanches available in Switzerland. We also want to use and further develop this method to simulate sea ice and glacier calving. Gaume and team’s research was published this month in Nature Communications.","Tech Briefs features cutting-edge technologies developed by innovators within NASA, the military, federal laboratories, universities, and commercial companies.

Al Williams,"We always enjoy [w2aew’s] videos, and his latest on zener diodes is no exception. In it, he asserts that all Zener diodes are not created equal. Why? You’ll have to watch the video below to find out. Zener diodes are one of those strange items that have several uses but are not as popular as they once were. There was a time when the Zener was a reasonable way to regulate a voltage inexpensively and easily. Unfortunately the regulation characteristics were not very good, and the power lost was very high. But that was sometimes a reasonable trade, compared to putting a pass transistor and the associated discrete circuitry in place to make a linear regulator. With the advent of chips like the 7800-series regulators, you can have a high-quality regulator with one extra wire and still keep your costs under $1. Even if you want to do better and go with a switching power supply, that’s easy now and not much more expensive. So you don’t see as many Zener power supplies as you used to. But there are still cases where they are useful. For example as part of a voltage reference circuit, since they can be reasonably accurate if the load current is constant. They are also useful for clipping voltages, circuit protection, and can even be part of a random number generator that will take advantage of their inherent noise during avalanche operation. What’s avalanche operation? Watch the end of the video and find out. This isn’t the first time we’ve talked about the lowly Zener. We’ve also talked about Zeners and Schottky diodes, too.","We always enjoy [w2aew’s] videos, and his latest on zener diodes is no exception.

The Capitals have traded Orpik and Grubauer to the Colorado Avalanche for the 48th pick in the NHL draft. The teams announced the draft before the start of the draft Friday night, June 22. The trade clears salary-cap space for Washington, which is attempting to re-sign pending free agent defenseman John Carlson. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) (Photo: The Associated Press) DALLAS (AP) — The Colorado Avalanche signed goaltender Philipp Grubauer to a three-year contract and put defenseman Brooks Orpik on buyout waivers the day after acquiring them from the Washington Capitals. One person with knowledge of the move said the Avalanche signed Grubauer to a $10 million contract. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been announced. Another person said Colorado put Orpik on unconditional waivers with the purposes of buying out the final year of his contract. The person also spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team didn't announce the move. Grubauer, 26, will split time with Semyon Varlamov in net this season and could take over as Colorado's No. 1 goalie in 2019-20. He'll count $3.3 million against the salary cap the next three years. ""We all feel that he's ready to take the next step and become a No. 1,"" Colorado GM Joe Sakic said. ""We're excited to have two No. 1 goalies."" Assuming Orpik clears waivers, Colorado can buy him out Sunday, less than 48 hours after trading for him. Sakic told Orpik after trading for him that the team planned to explore a trade or buy out the 37-year-old. Sakic took on Orpik's $5.5 million salary in the trade to get Grubauer without giving up more than a second-round pick. ""I owed him the respect to let him know that the plan is to buy him out and let him be a free agent,"" Sakic said. ""I'm sure he'll have a lot of teams that'll want to add him to their group."" Capitals GM Brian MacLellan said Friday night he was open to bringing Orpik back if the price was right.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press) DENVER (AP) Colton Sissons got his second career hat trick and Colorado had two apparent goals nullified on replay review as the Nashville Predators beat the Avalanche 4-1 Wednesday night. Ryan Hartman added an empty-net goal with 2:54 left in Nashville's 11th consecutive regular-season victory against Colorado, which has lost four straight overall. Trailing 2-0, the Avalanche had an apparent goal at 1:29 of the second period waived off after a replay review showed the puck had drifted across the blue line, making it offside. Samuel Girard was straddling the blue line when he passed to Ian Cole, whose shot zoomed into the net past goalie Pekka Rinne only to have it erased after the Predators' challenge was upheld. A second Avalanche goal was disallowed, on a shot by Colin Wilson, with 12:33 remaining in the third following a Predators challenge. Officials took away the score after the replay review, saying the Avs were offside when the play started. Girard was at the center of the only goal that counted for Colorado, a power-play score. He fired a pass down the middle of the ice that Matt Calvert redirected past Rinne to pull the Avalanche to 2-1 at 7:08 of the second period. The goal was upheld after a replay review. Nashville rebuilt its lead on the power play. Kyle Turris, off a feed from Kevin Fiala, wristed a shot from inside the right circle that Sisson tipped into the net past goalie Semyon Varlamov for his third of the night at 19:57 of the second. Sisson got the first two thirds of the hat trick in the first period. At 13:39 of the period, Varlamov stopped a shot from Nick Bonino but the rebound trickled out and Sissons was there with his stick to tap it in. Four minutes later, Sissons gathered a cross-ice pass from Roman Josi and wristed a shot past Varlamov from in close. NOTES: Sisson has four multigoal games in his career, including his first hat trick last Jan. 5 against Tampa Bay.... Avalanche forward Sheldon Dries took a puck off the side of his face late in the first period. He stayed down on the ice stunned for several moments before managing to get up and skate off under his own power.

Jez Corden,"RAGE 2 is the unexpected sequel to 2010's post-apocalyptic shooter from id Software. RAGE 2 takes place decades after its predecessor, following a global catastrophe. An asteroid impact has wiped out virtually all civilization, leaving earth in a dilapidated state. Many of the survivors banded together to form enclaves, some passive, others violent, as lawlessness and chaos grip the land. RAGE owes a little more to Mad Max than some of the other post-apocalyptic titles out there, due to its focus on wasteland vehicular combat. To continue that tradition, id Software enlisted the aid of Avalanche Studios, known for its chaotic sandboxes like Just Cause and the criminally underrated take on the Mad Max universe, which in my opinion, has the best vehicular combat in an open world game, maybe ever. We went hands-on with RAGE 2 at Gamescom 2018, and we talked to id Software Studio Director Tim Willits and Senior Game Designer Loke Wallmo from Avalanche Studios. Setting the scene for mayhem Players take control of Walker in RAGE 2, a descendant of nanomachine-enhanced humans who used advanced technology to escape the asteroid impact. Walker also has these nanomachines, dubbed ""nanotrites"" in-game, and he can wield them more effectively than Nicholas Raine from the previous game, complete with superhuman strength. The tutorial narrator refers to you as a Wasteland Superhero, and that very much sums up RAGE 2's core gameplay premise. Taking place 30 years after the first game, RAGE 2 will feature an all-new cast and self-contained story, although it will feature nods and returning characters for fans of the original. RAGE 2 will also ditch the ""50 shades of brown,"" as described by id Software's Willits, in favor of brighter colors and a wider variety of biomes. The orbital ""Arks"" used by humanity to avoid complete annihilation also came equipped with terraforming equipment to repair the world's ecology after the asteroid impact. Their descent to earth has created forests, swamps, and other types of terrain not present in the original. This gives RAGE 2 its own personality, as the world recovers from the desert wasteland of its predecessor. RAGE 2 doesn't have an RPG-like ""EXP"" system or anything of that nature, but there are characters and quests scattered throughout the world that will give you upgrades for virtually any weapon or system tied to your character. RAGE 2 will also feature some vehicle customization and grant you the ability to collect vehicles. Any vehicle in the game can be hijacked and driven, too, including the hulking war machine big-rigs. While you will be fighting plenty of Mad Max-style primitivist bandits in RAGE 2, you will also be battling twisted mutants, deranged cultists, and the game's central antagonist, The Authority, who are all attempting to take over what little remains of civilization by force. Devoid of morals, The Authority utilizes an army of twisted cyborgs and bastardized nanotrite technology, so they should prove to be more difficult to battle than your average road warrior. Chaotic combat with elegant execution RAGE 2 retains some familiarity from the original title. Notably, the Mad Max-inspired boomerang-like ""wingsticks"" return, with some brand new homing technology. And RAGE 2 is still the fast-paced shooter that you remember. RAGE 2's combat flows with an elegance the original RAGE simply couldn't achieve. The demo we played took place in an abandoned space facility, where the player is tasked with overseeing the landing of a satellite. The base, naturally, has been taken over by bandits and crazies, and the demo gave us a multitude of violent toys to play with. RAGE 2 isn't a cover-based shooter by any means. In keeping with titles like DOOM, you're supposed to be fast on your feet, moving from area to area with a shotgun in hand and nanotrite superpowers in the other. RAGE 2 will have a wide array of weapons, so we're told, but in our demo, the shotgun stood out as particularly unique. I got to play RAGE 2 at Gamescom 2018, and it might have some of the best shotgun gameplay I've ever seen. (Reuploaded, wrong clip before) pic.twitter.com/LzpyQOfuHk — Jezpunk 2077 (@JezCorden) August 30, 2018 One of RAGE's signature features was the realistic and unpredictable way enemies moved. They could vault over objects, parkour along walls, and swing from bars. id Software seems to have continued this tradition in RAGE 2, but now it works both ways. The shotgun isn't only incredibly satisfying to use simply from a first-person-shooter (FPS) standpoint, but now, it also has impact. Hitting an armored enemy in the chest might not kill them, but the force will knock them flying across objects, splattering onto the corners of tables or hanging over railings. You can also use it to push them off ledges or out of windows, when not killing them outright. The sheer force of a weapon is something often overlooked by other shooters, and it simply felt tremendous in RAGE 2. Nanotrites in the first game only allowed the player to resurrect in the field with an internal defibrillator, but their implementation in RAGE 2 goes far deeper. Walker can quickly dash left and right, to escape bullet fire. He can also do a force punch, reducing unarmoured and low-health enemies to piles of bloody chunks. You can also leap into the air and forcefully strike the ground, creating a wave of devastation, knocking enemies flying away when you're surrounded. You can feel the touch of Avalanche at every level in RAGE 2, with the way the game's physics-based systems interact with one another. Perhaps you punch someone across the room with the Shatter nanotrite ability, and they might slam into a gas canister and cause an explosion, which might then chain react with other nearby explosives in a scene wholly reminiscent of Just Cause. The organic nature of these gameplay mechanics creates dynamic events that are far more memorable than any scripted sequence. As a result, every weapon and every ability I tried in RAGE 2 was incredibly infectious to use, creating unpredictable sequences that were awe-inspiring. RAGE 2's combat flows with an elegance the original RAGE simply couldn't achieve. RAGE 2 is the result of a match made in gaming heaven RAGE 2 looks like its shaping up to be a match made in gaming heaven, as id Software and Avalanche Studios' unique skillsets intersect and complement each other like few gaming partnerships have. The industry-leading shooter expertise of id Software is on full display in RAGE 2, and merging it with Avalanche's open-world tech and vehicular combat from Just Cause and Mad Max holds a tremendous amount of promise. RAGE 2 is a completely single-player experience, although id Software teases some connected ""community"" features and some post-launch content. The game world will be ""massive,"" completely free of loading screens or artificial sector gating, allowing players the freedom to explore the wastes, jungles, and ruins as they see fit. RAGE 2 doesn't have a fixed launch date as of writing, but it should drop sometime in 2019 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",RAGE 2 is an upcoming dream collaboration between id Software and Avalanche.

Chelsea Gohd Space.com Staff Writer,"A small space rock crashed into Mars recently, and NASA has captured an amazing view of its crater grave site, as well as the trail from an avalanche triggered by the impact. The new Mars crater was likely caused by a meteoroid impact within the past 10 years, NASA officials explained in an image description. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)spotted the crater from orbit, and the agency released the image on June 15. ""The crater itself is only 5 meters [16.5 feet] across, but the streak it started is 1 kilometer long!"" NASA officials wrote. ""Slope streaks are created when dry dust avalanches leave behind dark swaths on dusty Martian hills. The faded scar of an old avalanche is also visible to the side of the new dark streak."" [ Latest Photos by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ] The impact crater is tiny, but the mark it left, as you can see in the image, is massive. When the meteoroid that caused this crater hit Mars, it destabilized the slope it collided with, which caused an avalanche of Martian dust, dirt and sand. This event left a dark streak, known as a slope streak, across the Martian surface. And as NASA pointed out, you can still see the ""scar"" from an older avalanche nearby. Sights like the long, dark streaks on a Martian hill are not uncommon on the surface of the Red Planet. And researchers agree that these dark slope streaks are caused by dust avalanches. The Martian surface is covered in sand, dirt and dust granules, and the planet is known to have storms and be struck by meteoroids. (A meteoroid is a small rock in space. When it enters an atmosphere and flares up, it is known as a meteor. Any fragments that reach the surface are called meteorites.) However, for years, scientists have pondered the origins of these marks. Previously, researchers suggested that these dark streaks could be caused by transient, flowing briny water, perhaps indicating that Mars is habitable, as many have suspected over time. Researchers thought that subterranean water could have been rising to the surface and causing the dark streaks. This theory was supported when MRO detected hydrated salts in these streaks. Some even suggested that the streaks were caused by seasonal carbon-dioxide frost. However, a study published last spring in the journal Nature Geoscience points to avalanches as the leading cause of the streaks. MRO took this spectacular new impact-crater image using HiRISE, or High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, which was built by Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp., of Boulder, Colorado,and is operated by the University of Arizona.

"USA TODAY, John Bacon, USA TODAY","Parkland, Florida gunman Nikolas Cruz has been getting showered with tons of fan mail that include sexually explicit pictures and donations. Buzz60 Nikolas Cruz appears in court for a status hearing before Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer on Feb, 19 in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. (Photo: Getty Images) Nikolas Cruz, the teen accused of killing 17 people in a shooting rampage at a Florida high school last month, is attracting an avalanche of mail from fans offering friendship, encouragement and sexually provocative photos. The South Florida Sun Sentinel obtained hundreds of pages of photocopies of letters and photos sent to Cruz, 19, who is being held while awaiting trial on a litany of charges including 17 counts of first degree murder. “No one else is dealing w/your demons, meaning maybe defeating them could be the beginning of your meaning, friend,"" an 18-year-old from New York wrote in a letter decorated with pink hearts. ""I know you could use a good friend right now. Hang in there and keep your head up."" A woman from Chicago sent Cruz nine photos, including a photos in a bikini, of her cleavage and of her butt as she bent over. A Texas woman commented on his ""beautiful"" eyes and ""handsome"" freckles. Cruz is on suicide watch and is not permitted to receive mail. Jail officials open the mail. Most is routed to Broward County Public Defender Howard Finkelstein, whose office is representing Cruz. Finkelstein told the Sun Sentinel he has never seen so much mail for a defendant in his 40 years as a public defender. “We read a few religious ones to him that extended wishes for his soul and to come to God,” Finkelstein said, “We have not and will not read him the fan letters or share the photos of scantily-clad teenage girls.” More: Prosecutor seeks death penalty for Florida shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz More: Nikolas Cruz's brother arrested at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High Cruz is not the first mass murderer to draw a rabid fan following. Charles Manson, who died in prison in November, was briefly engaged in 2014 to a woman who ran the website Release Charles Manson Now. Finkelstein said he worries that young people are looking up to Cruz: “That scares me. It's perverted.” Cruz, 19, walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas School in Parkland on Valentine's Day, armed with a semiautomatic rifle. He walked out about six minutes later amid chaos as students fled to safety or hunkered down in classrooms. In addition to the death toll, more than a dozen students and staff were wounded in the carnage. After stopping at a Walmart and a McDonald's, Cruz was apprehended by a police officer about an hour after the rampage, walking in a neighborhood not far from the school. The tragedy energized student leaders at the school to demand safer schools and tighter restrictions on guns. They organized a student walkout at schools nationwide, then a March for Our Lives that drew more than a million people to rallies and marches across the nation and around the world.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire. The Howe Ridge Fire “grew significantly” on Sunday according to a Facebook post by the park, the same day Glacier hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time in recorded history. The blaze has led the park to close portions of the iconic Going-to-the-Sun Road from Apgar to Logan Pass, and to evacuate Lake McDonald Lodge and Avalanche Creek Campground around 9 p.m. local time on Sunday. The park also evacuated private home inholdings and park ranger housing. According to the Missoulian, the park has requested a structure protection team to hold back the flames. There are at least two other fires currently burning in the park, all likely sparked by lightning. So far, firefighting efforts have consisted of planes dumping water, smokejumpers parachuting in, and attempts to access the fires on foot, but the blazes continue largely uncontained for now. Earther has reached out to Glacier National Park for more information on the size of the fires, firefighting efforts, and how long evacuation orders will remain in place or if they’ll expand. Smoke continues to obscure views and fill the sky with noxious fumes. As ash and other particulate matter falls from the sky, it could also add insult to injury for Glacier’s glaciers. Rising temperatures have caused the glaciers to recede and disappear over the course of the park’s history. The dark particles from wildfire smoke will absorb more sunlight, acting as a dark blanket that could cause the glaciers to melt even faster. Not only has it been hot, it’s been dry. According to the National Weather Service, Missoula—located about 130 miles south of Glacier—has gone 40 days without a lick of measurable rain. If the streak continues for seven, it will set a record for the longest dry stretch. Records go back to 1893 and the current record was set in [checks notes] 2017. Well then. Western Montana is under a number of fire restrictions due to the hot, dry weather. Glacier is under a Stage I ban, which essentially means folks need to be more vigilant about campfires, smoking, fireworks, and off-roading. To the south of Glacier, a Stage II burn ban is in place, which means no fires, fireworks, smoking outdoors, or off-roading. I feel like a broken record saying this, but it bears repeating that we are witnessing a new era of wildfires in the West. Rising temperatures have lengthened wildfire season by drying out fuels and melting out snowpack earlier. The increasing heat also ups the odds of explosive fires like what we’ve seen from California to Montana to British Columbia. And it’s going to get worse.","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire.

Dean Takahashi,"I’d like to meet the artists at Avalanche Studios who came up with the crazy art of Rage 2. I can guarantee you that they’re nuts, because they have created a postapocalyptic world that is even more insane than the one from one of their prior projects, Mad Max. You have to wonder how they had the imagination to create Rage 2, at least until you meet Tim Willits.
Willits is the studio director at id Software, and he commanded them to honor one of his pillars for the game by writing on a whiteboard: “More crazy than Rage.” And that’s how id Software wound up with a game that has a far different tone from its prior games like Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake, and even the original Rage from 2011.
How crazy is it? It has so many colors mixed together that when you shoot someone up close with a shotgun blast, you can’t even tell the red blood spraying on the wall from all the other colors. We’ve seen some crazy shooters before like Saints Row, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, and Just Cause 4. It so happens that the latter game was made by Avalanche Studios, which is building Rage 2 for ZeniMax’s id Software. Rage 2 joins this happy genre on May 14 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
I played Rage 2‘s latest demo at an event in San Francisco, and then we talked. Willits did a short presentation and then opened it up for a Q&amp;A with a group of journalists. (I’ve marked that part of the conversation with “question,” and my part of the interview is marked with “GamesBeat” queries). Has he lost it? Well, Willits may have indeed gone crazy to greenlight such a game. But then again, as a game developer who grew up at id Software making bloody shooter games, Willits may never have been sane in the first place.
Here’s an edited transcript of our interview.
Above: Tim Willits is studio director at id Software.

Tim Willits: There are two questions that everyone asked me. The first question is, Why Rage 2? and the second question is, How is the relationship with Avalanche? How did that come together and how do you work together?
To answer the first question, Rage has always had a special place in our hearts at id Software. Millions of people played it. It was well-rated. We always liked to bring our style of combat to an open world. But one of the problems with the original Rage was that the technology really limited us to not much of an open world. You had gunplay areas and driving areas and cities. You had level loading and switching disks. That was a nightmare. I like to say that mega-textures look pretty, but they werent great for actual gameplay. But we always wanted to come back to this world, because we love the open world style.
When Avalanche Studios, the Swedish studio, very famous for Just Cause and Mad Max — when that team wrapped up Max and there was an opportunity to work with them, we jumped on that opportunity. Weve liked those guys for a long time, and theyve liked us. Whats great about working with Avalanche is, they bring to the table the Apex engine. This is the Avalanche engine. Its not id Software technology. They also bring the love and experience of creating these open world games.
What we bring, we have a lot of experience on hardcore first-person shooters. If youve played Doom 2016 when it came out, that pushed forward combat, excelled at combat. Weve taken a lot of inspiration from that style of combat. You may not have realized this, but all the mechanics really do get you closer to the action, even though its a much bigger game. All of the active abilities really get you into the fight. Even the weapons — we dont have a classic sniper rifle in this game. We reward you for getting into the action.
Avalanche, like I say, is the developer, but a number of people at id work with them every day. We have experts at id that have helped bring this id style of combat to the open world. Its not like a block of code that we just check into their engine. Its the knowledge of where the gun position should be, animation, speed, situational weapons, things like that. When weve had resources at id working on the game, theyve come in and worked with the Avalanche team on the specific things they do really well.
Weve learned a lot by working with the Avalanche team. Personally, I come from a level design background. Ive always thought about levels where you have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Avalanche has taught me to think more about levels as areas you can approach in any way.

Question: Compared to the original game, it feels like it has a much more over the top, bombastic, almost cartoonish theme running through it. Can you explain why you wanted to go in that direction?
Willits: Rage was very brown and drab. Mad Max was very brown and drab. When we got together, we opened the color wheel and said, Wow, look at all these colors! This is amazing! Like I said before, we wanted to set the world apart from the original. The engine has allowed us to create these biomes that bring much more richness to the environment, which then led to us creating characters that were brighter and more colorful. And then the vehicles and the architecture.
All that seeped into the tone and the personality of the game. We wanted to create a game that was fun. We dont take ourselves too seriously. Sometimes game designers forget that games are supposed to be fun. By really setting the look and the colors and the tone apart from not only our own post-apocalyptic games, but we also have other post-apocalyptic games out there that exist in the space — it allows it to be refreshing. We can focus on the fun aspects of playing video games.
Question: Did you have a line where you thought, We still want to retain some of that gritty feeling of the original and not go too far?” Or did you just want to go all the way there?
Willits: There is some — youve played it. There are some things that are a little dark-ish. But no, we had no official lines. When I met with the team in Stockholm, I wrote on the whiteboard, MORE CRAZY THAN RAGE. That was the first pillar of this game. The Avalanche team loved the fact that they could do whatever they wanted to. They were not constrained by some defined universe that they had to live in. Thats our mentality.
Question: How much story is there? Is that something that keeps pulling you in a particular direction?
Willits: Like I mentioned before, you as Walker, thats a very classic story. But the bulk of the story really does come from Marshall and Loosum and Kvasir. You got a little bit there, the power struggle with Clayton and things. And then of course theres the other characters in the world that you can talk to, and the environmental storytelling. But those characters really drive the story.
You, as Walker, you talk, which is new for us. A few people have told me that, when they first started playing and Walker talked, they thought, Whats going on? It threw them off. But we did that to help tell more of a story. We did that to help people who never played the first one — Walker will tell you what you need to know when you play. If you notice, sometimes Walker says things that youre thinking, making fun of video game tropes. Im really supposed to stick my arm into this? Im the only guy who can do this? He helps push the story forward as well.

Question: You brought up Doom, and I thought of that too when I was playing, but I think the thing that made Dooms push-forward combat so good was the lack of reloading, always sprinting in every direction. This game doesnt have that. How do you think that affects getting to the combat that you want?
Willits: We couldnt re-create the exact same microcosm of action that we had in Doom. With the weapons and the reliability of the weapons we have, we wanted to keep reload in, so you can fight, fight, pace, reload, set up, and then re-engage. But with the abilities and rewarding people for quick kills, that does help you get into the action. When people play it, Ive been very pleased when they come back and say, Yeah, it feels like an id game, but it has all this other stuff. Kind of like the love child of Avalanche and id.
Question: Was there any required reading or source that the development team had to take in for this?
Willits: When you play it, obviously, you can sense things in the world that are inspired. We get this question a lot. Rage, of course, was an inspiration. The games that Avalanche has done have been an inspiration. Weve tapped into some of that 80s punk culture a bit. Some of the classic comic books, were all big fans. If you read the original Judge Dredd comics, you can see some inspirations there.
One thing we do try to do, though, is keep a flat enough design structure where everyone feels they can bring their own inspirations and desires into the game. The world is crazy enough, for lack of a better word, where we can bring stuff in from all over and it all just works.
Question: Not to only compare it to Doom, but did you ever feel like you were competing with yourself, in a way? Youd come up with design ideas and realize, you already did that in something like Doom?
Willits: Its always a fine line. You want every game to be unique, but then for id games, we like to have that DNA that flows through them. You can pick them up and play them and it feels like an id game. There are some mechanics that have naturally evolved into our games. We have double jump here, and we had double jump in DOOM, for instance. If you watch the DOOM stuff we showed at QuakeCon, and then play this, it looks a bit similar. But they have unique personalities and unique styles. Theres enough difference that they stand on their own.

Question: Is this Avalanches engine entirely, or is it a shared code base?
Willits: No, theres no id Software technology in this game. But again, a lot of the lessons we took away — there is no cover mechanic for you as a player, but the enemy does take cover. When you shoot them and they get back up, that was a signature component of the AI in the original, and we brought that back. Knocking the armor off some of the beefier enemies, that was a signature piece in the original. We tried to bring that back in.
Question: When it got more crazy, it also got more like Just Cause. Did you want to avoid comparisons to things like that?
Willits: Its hard to make a franchise for so many years and not have inspirations come from there. Ive always been a big Just Cause fan. Thats the Avalanche style. I tell the guys sometimes, More exploding barrels! More stuff that swings and breaks and blows up and falls over! Thats the Avalanche thing. Ive actually pushed them more toward the Avalanche style, because its just fun. There is no wingsuit, though, and no grappling hook.
Question: What is a Nanotrite?
Willits: You didnt play the original, did you? [laughs] Thats okay. Let me back up into the fiction. When the asteroid was going to hit the earth, mankind started the Eden Project. We froze people in arks underground, and then we put nano-robots inside the systems of the people who were frozen. The idea was that the nano-robots would heal you and help you survive in a post-apocalyptic world.
This technology has advanced, and the Authority and scientists from the Eden Project learned how to manipulate and enhance the Nanotrites. That led to using them as the fiction behind what you can do in the game.
Question: Its always hard to tell in open world games, but do you have an estimated play time for the game?
Willits: I get that question a lot. People are spending longer, even on this small section of the game. You all spent much longer than I originally thought anyone would, which is good. But we havent really had testers starting from the very beginning with as much time as they want to go play. So I know this sounds cagey, but we havent gone through that exercise yet.

Question: Do you have any PvP plans for the game?
Willits: Its a single-player game. We will have a few community things, but well be talking about those later. We feel that were offering great value in this game, and its only single-player. We will have some free updates and some paid updates. We want to extend the tail of the product.
Another question I get a lot is on systems and platforms. Whats the difference between the game on the Xbox One and Xbox One X? We went with speed over 4K. On the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, the faster consoles, itll run at 60fps. On the slower consoles itll run at 30fps. On PCs itll run as fast your system lets it, and itll run in 4K, of course. You were playing on PC today. I think they were just 1080s.
Question: Have you considered co-op play at all?
Willits: Weve talked about that a lot. People love playing with their friends. As game developers — and Todd Howard is famous for saying this, so Ill steal his line — we can do anything, but we cant do everything. For us, we wanted to focus on core combat. We wanted to focus on a really great world. Thats where we ended up. But it would be cool, and we have talked about it.","Tim Willits, studio director at id Software, talks about why Rage 2 is such a crazy, bombastic, and farcical title set in a nightmare postapocalyptic world.",2019-01-30T15:15:19Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Venturebeat.com'}",Tim Willits interview: Rage 2 gets crazier with an injection of Just Cause and Mad Max,https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/30/tim-willits-interview-why-rage-2-is-getting-a-bigger-dose-of-bombast/,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rage-7.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,,Venturebeat.com,avalanche,1

Five soldiers were taken to a hospital in Burlington with non-life-threatening injuries, and the sixth soldier received ""mild injuries"" and returned to duty Wednesday, Staff Sgt. Nathan Rivard said. The soldiers were training in advanced mountaineering in Smugglers Notch, a narrow pass at the northern edge of Mount Mansfield, when an avalanche occurred at around 1 p.m., Rivard said. Part of that training includes what to do if caught in an avalanche. All injured were conscious and alert after the avalanche, Rivard said. They were swept, but not buried, he said. The soldiers were located within 10 minutes and moved off the mountain within an hour and 40 minutes.

"AP, AP","CHICAGO (AP) Duncan Keith scored 1:23 into overtime to give the Chicago Blackhawks a 2-1 victory over the Colorado Avalanche on Sunday night.
The defenseman took a feed from Brandon Saad, bulled his way down left wing, shrugged off a check from Nathan MacKinnon and beat goaltender Phillipp Grubauer between the legs to snap the Blackhawks' three-game losing streak. Chicago pulled within five points of Colorado for the second Western Conference wild card.
Artem Anisimov had a power-play goal for the Blackhawks, tying it 1-all early in the third period. Corey Crawford made 19 saves.
Alexander Kerfoot scored on a 5-on-3 power play for the Avalanche, who had won four straight.
Kerfoot opened the scoring with Colorado's second 5-on-3 goal in two games. He deflected Tyson Barrie's slap shot past Crawford with 4:34 left in the second period while Marcus Kruger and Jonathan Toews were in the penalty box.
Chicago tied it on Anisimov's goal 1:44 into the third. Anisimov moved to the slot after winning the faceoff from Carl Soderberg and deflected Brent Seabrook's slap shot from the point past Grubauer. It was Chicago's second power-play goal in 11 games.
The Avalanche controlled play early, with Sven Andrighetto hitting the post 65 seconds in, but the Blackhawks gradually took over. They forced Grubauer to make 40 stops, including a brilliant glove save on Toews with 3:26 remaining in regulation.
Colorado didn't get a shot in overtime. The Avalanche controlled play for the first 50 seconds, but Chicago took control of the puck after a battle on the boards and it eventually came to Saad, who found Keith open on the left side.
NOTES: Colorado is 11-5-2 in its last 18 games. ... Chicago is 9-7-1 in its past 17 after going 10-2 to climb into the playoff race. ... Colorado LW Gabriel Landeskog (upper body) missed his eighth straight game. ... Chicago C Drake Caggiula (concussion) missed his 11th consecutive game. ... Chicago juggled its line combinations, putting a slumping Alex DeBrincat back with Toews and Patrick Kane.

"AP, AP","TORONTO (AP) Jack Hughes will have a pretty good idea of where he'll be headed after Tuesday night.
Expected to be the top pick at June's NHL draft, the 17-year-old center with the U.S. national development team will be on hand when the lottery results are revealed in Toronto.
The 15 teams that failed to qualify for the 2019 playoffs or franchises that acquired the first-round picks of nonplayoff clubs will participate in the lottery.
The Colorado Avalanche, who open the postseason Thursday against the Calgary Flames, have the best odds of landing the first pick at 18.5% after acquiring the selection from the Ottawa Senators in the trade for Matt Duchene in November 2017.
Ottawa, which finished 31st in the overall standings, could have sent the team's first pick at last June's draft to Colorado, but decided instead to keep the selection before drafting winger Brady Tkachuk at No. 4.
Tuesday's draft lottery will consist of three separate drawings for first, second and third overall meaning the Avalanche can pick no later than fourth.
The top-ranked North American skater by NHL Central Scouting, Hughes had 12 goals and 36 assists in 24 games for the USNDT this season.
Finish winger Kappo Kakko, meanwhile, is ranked as the top European skater.
The Los Angeles Kings have the second-best odds at 13.5%, followed by the New Jersey Devils (11.5, Detroit Red Wings (9.5%), Buffalo Sabres (8.5%), New York Rangers (7.5%), Edmonton Oilers (6.5%), Anaheim Ducks (6%), Vancouver Canucks (5%), Philadelphia Flyers (3.5%), Minnesota Wild (3%), Chicago Blackhawks (2.5%), Florida Panthers (2%), Arizona Coyotes (1.5%) and Montreal Canadiens (1%).
The 12 clubs not selected in three lottery draws will be assigned draft selections four through 15, in inverse order of regular-season standings.
This year's draft is set for Vancouver's Rogers Arena on June 21 and 22.

"Emily Peck, Arthur Delaney","Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) latest policy idea seems laudable at first glance: Penalize big corporations when their workers tap public benefits, such as food stamps and Medicaid, to get by. Unveiled this week and unabashedly aimed at Amazon and its wildly wealthy CEO, Jeff Bezos, Sanders’ Stop BEZOS Act would slap a 100 percent tax on companies with 500 or more workers until the government recovers the monetary value of all the social welfare used by their workers: Medicaid, food stamps, even school lunch subsidies. For instance, for every dollar an employee receives in food stamp benefits, the company would pay an extra dollar in taxes. The idea is to shame some of the country’s largest and most successful companies for paying workers so poorly that they have to rely on government aid. But the bill doesn’t just shame companies, it spreads that shame to the very idea of social welfare by demonizing benefits, economists say. That’s a play usually reserved for Republicans and conservatives, who love to bang the drum against the nation’s “takers.” The bill, which doesn’t stand much chance of going anywhere, could give big companies a reason not to hire those who get benefits, a majority of whom are parents. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, one of the most influential left-leaning think tanks in Washington, criticized the Sanders plan in a blog post on Wednesday. Several progressive policy types ― such as Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and Mike Konzcal of the Roosevelt Institute ― sounded sour notes on Twitter. “It’s ham-fisted,” Betsey Stevenson, a labor economist at the University of Michigan who served on the Obama administration’s Council of Economic Advisers, told HuffPost. If the goal is to get companies to pay higher wages, this won’t do it, added Stevenson, who specializes in examining how public policy affects the labor market. In an interview with HuffPost, Sanders dismissed the criticism. “We have thousands of workers working for an extremely profitable corporation owned by the wealthiest person in this country who are making wages so low they are forced to go on public assistance,” he said. “All we are asking of Mr. Bezos is pay your workers a living wage.” There’s already stigma in the United States surrounding food stamps and other social safety benefits. Some Americans won’t apply for food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to avoid the shame involved, Stevenson said. Yet the public safety net offers a real benefit to American workers. Single parents, in particular, rely on Medicaid and monthly food benefits in order to raise children in a country that offers little other supports to families (such as subsidized day care or parental leave). Nearly 70 percent of food stamp benefits go to households with children. Though Sanders’ proposal includes a provision that blocks employers from asking applicants if they are on public benefits, that wouldn’t necessarily stop a company from profiling workers or not hiring those who seem likely to use benefits, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in its blog post. “In addition, some employers might pressure employees not to sign up for Medicaid or other benefits,“CBPP’s Robert Greenstein, Sharon Parrott and Chye-Ching Huang wrote. “And elements of the business community would likely lobby policymakers to reduce their tax bills by restricting eligibility and benefits for core low-income programs, which would be equivalent to a corporate tax cut.” Welfare recipients in the U.S. are often subject to work requirements, so if you get food stamps or Medicaid, in some states you also must work a certain amount per week. This bill, by disincentivizing hiring such workers, would make it even harder for them to land a job, thus causing more of them to lose benefits. “It’s really unfair. Recipients would end up in a situation where there is a work requirement and employers are told that they’ll be penalized for hiring them,” Stevenson said. Sanders rejected the idea that employers would discriminate against poor applicants, suggesting reasonable pay itself would solve the problem. “If you pay people a living wage, they will have an adequate income,” he said. Even though the bill stands little chance of becoming law, that doesn’t mean it’s OK that the policy idea is flawed, Baker told HuffPost last week. When you create an economic policy, you want to make sure it’s a good, effective idea, he said. “Amazon has a history of treating workers badly, yes,” he said. “But this isn’t likely going to change that.”",Progressives are calling it a “ham-fisted” and counterproductive way to help low-wage workers.,2018-09-06T23:08:36Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Bernie Sanders Hit With Avalanche Of Criticism Over Amazon-Bashing Bill,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-amazon-bill_us_5b91944ae4b0cf7b003e0858,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9195722000002d0a37b7c3.jpeg?cache=tqhti4b7cx&ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,avalanche,1
"AP, AP","Buffalo Sabres goalie Carter Hutton (40) stops Colorado Avalanche forward Alexander Kerfoot (13) during the second period of an NHL hockey game Thursday, Oct. 11, 2018, in Buffalo, N.Y. (AP Photo/Jeffrey T. Barnes) (Photo: The Associated Press) BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) Nathan MacKinnon scored twice to extend his season-opening goal streak to four games and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Buffalo Sabres 6-1 on Thursday night. Semyon Varlamov stopped 30 shots to improve to 3-0. He's allowed just four goals this season. Tyson Jost, Colin Wilson, Carl Soderberg and Alexander Kerfoot also scored, helping Colorado improve to 3-1 for the third straight year. Mikko Rantanen set up three goals and has six assists for the season. Mackinnon matched the Colorado franchise record for a goal streak to open a season, set by John Mitchell three years ago. Sabres defenseman Rasmus Dahlin, the first overall draft pick this summer, got his first career point with an assist on Nathan Beaulieu's goal that cut the Avalanche's lead to 3-1 with 2:27 left in the second period. Buffalo (2-2) squandered a chance to match last season's team-best three-game winning streak. Carter Hutton made 24 saves for the Sabres. The Avalanche fulfilled coach Jared Bednar's objective of getting off to a better start two nights after falling behind 2-0 midway through the first period of a 5-2 loss at Columbus. Against Buffalo, Colorado built a 2-0 lead 13:20 in on power-play goals from Jost and Wilson over a span of 2:25. Jost scored by tipping in Tyson Barrie's shot from the right point. Wilson scored when Samuel Girard's shot from the blue line was blocked by Buffalo's Conor Sheary. The puck dribbled to Wilson, who scored from the slot. Soderberg capped a three-goal first period by winning a faceoff to the right of the Sabres net and converting a centering pass from Gabriel Bourque, who was circling the net. The Sabres had a goal disallowed following a coaching challenge for goaltending interference with 22 seconds left in the first period. Officials determined Kyle Okposo interfered with Varlamov when he crashed into the crease to convert Jack Eichel's pass. After redirecting the pass, Okposo backed into the goalie, forcing Varlamov to lift his right pad and allowing the puck to sneak in beneath it. MacKinnon regained Colorado's three-goal edge by scoring 28 seconds after Beaulieu. It came on a broken play during which a pass along the left boards inside the Sabres zone got caught up in the skates of referee Francis Charron. Rantanen picked up the puck and set up MacKinnon for a one-timer at the left post. NOTES: Colorado converted 2 of 4 power-play opportunities, while Buffalo went zero for seven.... Avalanche C Vladislav Kamenev made his season debut. Acquired from Nashville in a three-team trade in November, he missed 50 games after breaking his arm in his Avalanche debut.... Sabres LW Johan Larsson made his season debut since sustaining a lower body injury during the preseason. D Zach Bogosian (lower body) was placed on injured reserve.

Associated Press,"(BERLIN) — Authorities warned Sunday of a high risk of avalanches on the northern side of the Alps, after heavy snowfall in recent days created dangerous conditions across parts of southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
A 20-year-old skier died in an avalanche Saturday on Mount Teisen, near the Austrian border, German police said. The woman’s five companions were unharmed.
In Austria, public broadcaster ORF reported that a 26-year-old man died Sunday after being struck by an avalanche while skiing near the town of Schoppernau.
Authorities in Austria closed some roads and train lines because of avalanche risks, while airports in the region have seen delays as workers struggled to clear the large amount of fresh snow and de-ice planes.
Hundreds of passengers were stuck for hours on a train early Sunday after a snow-laden tree crashed onto the tracks near Kitzbuehel, Austria. About 14,000 households were temporarily left without electricity in northern Austria because of damage to power lines.
ORF reported that about 600 residents and tourists were still stuck in the Austrian village of Soelktal following a road closure. An Austrian army helicopter managed to drop some supplies there on Sunday.
Officials in the nearby Salzburg region described the situation as “very precarious,” noting that large avalanches could be triggered spontaneously.
The German weather service DWD forecast a further 40 centimeters (almost 16 inches) of snowfall in some areas by Monday.

(AP) Mikko Rantanen's power-play slap shot with 1.3 seconds on the clock in overtime gave the Colorado Avalanche a 4-3 victory Sunday over the slumping Anaheim Ducks. Nathan MacKinnon scored twice and Rantanen had two assists for the Avalanche, who overcame a 3-1 deficit to hand the Ducks their 12th loss in 15 games. Sven Andrighetto also had a goal for Colorado, and Philipp Grubauer stopped 30 shots. Brandon Montour, Ryan Getzlaf and Ondrej Kase scored for Anaheim. Ryan Miller made 38 saves. MacKinnon tied it 3-all at 11:20 of the third period, taking a nice feed from Rantanen behind the net. The Ducks led 3-2 after a high-scoring second period. Colorado tied it at 1 when Andrighetto got a pass from Patrick Nemeth and slipped the puck past Miller. Anaheim regained the lead with a power-play goal a minute later as Getzlaf fired a slap shot from long range that beat Grubauer up high. The Ducks made it 3-1 when Montour came down the right side and sent a wrist shot that Kase deflected in for his first goal of the season. Just 4:34 into the second period, Montour had a career-high three points (one goal, two assists). The Avs pulled back within one on a power-play goal of their own as MacKinnon put in a rebound for his 13th of the season. The Ducks opened the scoring 4:45 into the first on Montour's goal. Pontus Aberg fired a shot from 40 feet out and the rebound came to Montour. He took the puck in stride, skated behind the net and slipped in a wraparound past Grubauer.

Ethan Gach,"Despite all of the explosions in Avalanche Studios open-world chaos simulator, Just Cause 4 did not set the world on fire when it launched last year on December 4. Now, less than 100 days later, its free for Game Pass subscribers to download and play on Xbox One.
Microsoft announced the game would be the latest to arrive on its Netflix-like service today alongside 2012s Lego Batman 2. Meanwhile, F1 2018 and Fallout 4 will get added on March 14, the latter of which was previously available on Game Pass last year but was removed just prior to the release of Fallout 76.
F1 2018, Fallout 4, and Lego Batman 2older games or niche titlesare the types youd expect on Game Pass. Another typical category includes first-party games like Forza Horizon 4 and Crackdown 3, which arrive on Game Pass the day they launch. Increasingly, there appears to be another category of Game Pass games: those that struggled when they were first released and are now looking for a second wind.
Middle-Earth: Shadow of War came out in September 2017, and though the game was positively received at first, its microtransaction system quickly became a target for outrage. Warner Bros. removed the in-game purchases last summer, and in January, it arrived on Game Pass.
In February, Microsoft announced that Shadow of the Tomb Raider, not even 6 months old at the time, would be arriving on the service. That same month, Square Enix announced that it had shipped 4.12 million copies of the game, meaning it had actually sold some amount less than that. The publisher said at the time that it hoped future DLC would continue to boost that number going into the future.
Just Cause 4, which Square also published, may have been in an even weaker position. Its hard to know precisely how the game sold, but we have some clues: It came in at No. 6 on the UKs chart of top selling games the week it was released, just behind Battlefield V, which came out the previous month, and Mario Kart 8: Deluxe, which came out the previous year. And in its earnings report for the third quarter of 2019 released in February, Square said that sales of Just Cause 4 fell below expectations.
It got off to a sluggish start, so we were not able to offset the amortization charges on the development costs, the company said during a Q&amp;A with investors. At the same time, Square said it intended to increase sales over the next couple of years through updates and other initiatives.
Its not clear whether putting the game on Game Pass is one of those initiatives, or how much it will help, but it certainly doesnt hurt to have more people trying out and your game. Just Cause 4 also has a $30 expansion pass for three pieces of DLC planned to come out sometime this year, which wont be available for the Game Pass version.","Despite all of the explosions in Avalanche Studios’ open-world chaos simulator, Just Cause 4 did not set the world on fire when it launched last year on December 4.

Tom Marks,"It turns out we already got a quick glimpse at one. By Tom Marks Rage 2 won’t just have cars to drive, it will also have flying vehicles, developer Avalanche Studios told IGN at QuakeCon 2018. In fact, it turns out we already saw an extremely brief glimpse of one of these flying vehicles back in Rage 2’s E3 extended gameplay trailer.

But yeah, it’s proper flying."" I asked Rage 2 game director Magnus Nedfors if the vehicle was “properly flying” or more like a hoverbike, and he said it’s likely somewhere in between. “It’s not a jet plane, it’s a little thing that you fly around. But yeah, it’s proper flying,” he explained. Nedfors told me that players will have a set of three vehicles that are their own. “There is one car, a bike, and a little flying vehicle that are yours,” he explained, saying “you can evolve them and you can customize them and so on.” But players aren’t limited to those three vehicles. “You can still go out in the wasteland and steal any car that you see and drive around in that,” Nedfors continued. You can collect those stolen cars too, and bringing them back to your base let’s you continue to use them later. Nedfors also told me that Avalanche is primarily developing Rage 2, with id collaborating on a creative level. The studio also revealed first story details and some more gameplay of Rage 2 at QuakeCon. Tom Marks is IGN's PC Editor and pie maker.

Schenn scored twice and Vince Dunn had a career-high three assists to help the St. Louis Blues beat the Colorado Avalanche 6-1 on Thursday night. Schenn's fight with Gabriel Landeskog three seconds into the game set the tone. ""I thought we'd been a little bit flat at home lately,"" Schenn said. ""You can try and start different ways, try to be physical early or offensive early.... I don't do it often, but it's part of the game and it's good to get one every once in a while."" Blues coach Mike Yeo knew something was brewing when Patrik Berglund lined up to take the opening faceoff instead of Schenn. ""I know people have different opinions of fighting in the game or whatever, but it sends a message to your team,"" Yeo said. Landeskog was also trying to give the Avalanche a spark. ""We've got to be better on the road so I figure, 'start off the road trip and set the tone,' and that was really it,"" Landeskog said. ""He asked me and I didn't have one this year so why not?"" Paul Stastny had a goal and an assist, and Ivan Barbashev, Kyle Brodziak and Alex Pietrangelo also scored.

Carter Hutton made 23 saves as St. Louis beat Colorado for the fourth straight time. The Blues have earned points against the Avalanche in 12 consecutive games. Dunn is the Blues' first rookie defenseman to have three assists in a game since Erik Johnson on Jan. 8, 2008.

Semyon Varlamov allowed three goals in relief of Jonathan Bernier after he allowed three goals in 20 shots. The Blues took control on goals by Barbashev and Schenn 48 seconds apart early in the second period. Barbashev's goal, beating Bernier short-side from a difficult angle at the left faceoff circle, broke a 1-1 tie at 4:17 of the second. Schenn's second of the game made it 3-1 and ended Bernier's night. It was Schenn's third multi-goal game this season. Brodziak and Pietrangelo blew the game open with goals later in the second and Stastny scored six minutes into the third period. ""I thought everyone stepped up tonight, everyone played a good game from the goalie out,"" Schenn said. ""Guys were getting rewarded, which was good to see."" Schenn put the Blues on top 1-0 with a power play goal at 8:41 of the first period. Schenn's 300th career point came off of a Jaden Schwartz slap shot off of Bernier's pad that deflected directly to his tape. The Blues lost defensemen Joel Edmundson (upper body) for the rest of the game eight minutes into the first after he blocked a shot from Colorado's Nail Yakupov. Yeo said he is definitely out for Friday's game at Winnipeg. ""When a guy goes down, everybody's got to step up and everybody's got to contribute like the way we did,"" Dunn said. Bourque tied it at 1 at 2:50 of the second, capitalizing on Vladimir Sobotka's giveaway. ""We have to be better,"" Landeskog said. ""I mean you look at the score, it's embarrassing.""

"USA TODAY, John Bacon, USA TODAY","The opioid epidemic is being called the worst public health crisis in American history, with its lethal consequences exacting a toll on users and families nationwide. Eric Hargan, acting secretary of HHS spoke about the crisis at the CDC. (Dec 4) AP OxyContin pills (Photo: Toby Talbot, AP) The pharmaceutical company that produces the painkiller OxyContin is slashing its sales staff and says it will halt, effective Monday, promotion of opioids to physicians and other health care professionals. The decision by Purdue Pharma comes as the industry battles an avalanche of lawsuits across the nation related to the opioid crisis. “We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers,"" Purdue Pharma said in a statement. Purdue's head of medical affairs, Monica Kwarcinski, sent a letter to prescribers updating the company's efforts to support ""responsible"" opioid use. ""Effective Monday, February 12, 2018, our field sales organization will no longer be visiting your offices to engage you in discussions about our opioid products,"" Kwarcinski said in the letter, which was released to media outlets. ""Requests for information about our opioid products will be handled through direct communication with the highly experienced health care professionals that comprise our Medical Affairs department."" Purdue said in a statement it is reducing its sales force by more than 50%. The remaining 200 sales reps will focus on non-opioid drugs such as Symproic, the company said. Symproic is used to treat opioid-related constipation. More: Opioid makers face hundreds of lawsuits More: Russian plane crashes near Moscow, killing all 71 aboard The company said it has consistently followed opioid guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control, which include a recommendation that opioids not be the first option for chronic pain. Purdue, a privately held company based in Stamford, Conn., has been slammed with lawsuits claiming the company has downplayed OxyContin's addiction risk. Opioid litigation increased sharply in 2017 when hundreds of cities, counties and states sued opioid makers, wholesalers, distributors and marketers. The lawsuits accuse the companies of, among other things, misleading prescribers and the public by marketing opioids as a safe substitute for non-addictive pain medications such as ibuprofen. Opioids also have been blamed for a resurgence in heroin use. The government claims the results have been tragic — and left government agencies with millions in social and health care costs. Purdue said in a statement that it ""vigorously denies"" allegations of misconduct, adding that its products account for only ""approximately 2%"" of all opioid prescriptions. ""We are deeply troubled by the opioid crisis, and we are dedicated to being part of the solution,"" the company said. Opioids are substances that work on the nervous system in the body or specific receptors in the brain to reduce the intensity of pain. The CDC says more than three out of five drug overdose deaths involve opioids — and that annual deaths from heroin and prescription opioids have increased more than five-fold since 1999, including 42,000 deaths in 2016. Purdue and three former executives pleaded guilty in federal court a decade ago to criminal charges of misleading the public about the addictive nature of OxyContin, paying more than $630 million in fines and penalties.

"AP, AP","Winnipeg Jets' Kyle Connor (81) takes control of the puck against Colorado Avalanche's Nikita Zadorov (16) as Dustin Byfuglien (33) watches during the second period of an NHL hockey game in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Friday, Feb. 16, 2018. (John Woods/The Canadian Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press) WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) — Blake Wheeler had two goals and an assist and Mark Scheifele assisted on three goals as the Winnipeg Jets defeated the Colorado Avalanche 6-1 on Friday night. Wheeler ended a 15-game goal drought and Scheifele now has seven points in his last three games. Kyle Connor, Andrew Copp, Patrik Laine and Nikolaj Ehlers also scored for Winnipeg, which is 5-2-1 during its 10-game homestand. Dustin Byfuglien and Tyler Myers each had two assists and Laine added one. Connor Hellebuyck made 30 saves to pick up his 30th win of the season. It was the most wins by a Jets goalie since the franchise moved to Winnipeg from Atlanta prior to the 2011-12 season. Ondrej Pavelec had 29 wins the first season. Avalanche forward Mikko Rantanen nixed Hellebuyck's shutout bid when he scored unassisted on a wraparound with 5:56 left in the third period. Colorado goalie Jonathan Bernier was pulled following the second period after Winnipeg went up 4-0 on 20 shots. Semyon Varlamov stopped six of the eight shots he faced in relief for the Avalanche. Wheeler's drought-ending goal — he had a dozen assists during that span while playing center — came when his shot from behind the goal line hit Bernier's left skate and slid inside the post at 10:09 of the first period. The Jets outmuscled and stole the puck just before their first two goals in the second. Byfuglien won a battle along the boards with winger Gabriel Landeskog and passed the puck to Connor for his 19th goal of the season at 10:49. Scheifele then stole the puck from Rantanen while Winnipeg was short-handed and went on a two-on-one for Copp's fifth goal of the season at 15:50. Four seconds after Avalanche forward Gabriel Bourque went to the penalty box for goaltender interference, Laine scored his team-leading 26th goal and NHL-leading 15th power play of the season on a one-timer with 28 seconds left in the period. Ehlers deflected in a Myers' shot from the point 5:24 into the third period for his 22nd goal. Wheeler put in his second of the game at 7:54 with a shot through over Varlamov's glove. Rantanen finished off the game's scoring with his 18th of the season. UP NEXT The Avalanche go home to take on Edmonton on Sunday. The Jets host Florida Sunday night.

"AP, AP","Ottawa Senators left wing Zack Smith tries to skate off the ice after being injured in the second period of an NHL hockey game against the Colorado Avalanche, Friday, Oct. 26, 2018, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press) DENVER (AP) Gabriel Landeskog broke a tie with 13:46 remaining as part of Colorado's four-goal third period to help the Avalanche beat the Ottawa Senators 6-3 on Friday night and spoil a two-goal performance from Matt Duchene in his return to Denver. Landeskog gave Colorado the lead for good by knocking in his ninth goal of the season off a feed from Mikko Rantanen. Colorado outscored the Senators 6-1 after falling behind 2-0 midway through the first period. Samuel Girard, Carl Soderberg, Rantanen, Nathan MacKinnon and Matt Nieto also scored for Colorado. Girard's goal was the first by an Avalanche defenseman this season. Colorado's top line of Landeskog, MacKinnon and Rantanen finished with a combined 10 points. Rantanen had three assists. Ryan Dzingel scored the game's first goal for Ottawa. Goaltender Philipp Grubauer started his first home game for the Avalanche and stopped 21 shots. Craig Anderson made 31 saves for the Senators. Duchene was greeted with a mixture of cheers and boos as he took the ice in the place where he spent his first eight-plus seasons. A disgruntled Duchene was traded to Ottawa last November as part of a three-team deal. For the occasion, Duchene rented a suite at the Pepsi Center for his wife, family and friends. He tipped in a shot in the first period and scored again on a break in the second to stake the Senators to a 3-1 lead. The Ottawa center was honored by the Avalanche midway through the first period. Duchene stood up on the bench and clapped in appreciation while his former teammates banged their sticks against the boards. Duchene was the third overall pick in 2009 by Colorado and scored 178 goals with the Avalanche, which is seventh on the franchise's all-time list. It was an awkward parting for Duchene, whose desire to leave was fueled in part by not wanting to be involved in another rebuilding project with Colorado. His Senators squad finished with the second-fewest points last season, while the Avalanche made the playoffs as the No. 8 seed. ""Sometimes you have to make tough decisions,"" Duchene said before the game. ""I enjoyed my time here and it was an honor."" He had dinner Thursday with Landeskog. ""I gave everything I had when I played here, right up to the last day,"" said Duchene, who has a house in the area and met his wife in Denver. ""This city is still home for me and will always be."" Notes: Senators LW Zack Smith went to the dressing room in the second period with an injury.... Colorado has a vested interest in the Senators this season. As part of the trade that also included Nashville, the Avs will have Ottawa's 2019 first-round pick. ""It would be nice to get a high pick,"" MacKinnon said. ""But I expect them to be a good team."" UP NEXT Senators: Stop No. 2 on their three-game trip will be Sunday in Vegas. Avalanche: Turn around and play at Minnesota on Saturday.

"AP, AP","The net comes off its moorings as Colorado Avalanche center Alexander Kerfoot (13) shoots on Calgary Flames goalie Mike Smith, right, and defenseman Mark Giordano (5) during the third period of an NHL hockey game Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, in Calgary, Alberta. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press) CALGARY, Alberta (AP) Mark Giordano had a goal and two assists, and the Calgary Flames scored five straight times in the third period to rally past the Colorado Avalanche 6-5 on Thursday night. With the game tied 4-all, Giordano scored the go-ahead goal at 13:47 of the third period when he jumped up into the rush, took a pass from Mikael Backlund and snapped a shot over the blocker of goaltender Semyon Varlamov. Backlund, Elias Lindholm, Sean Monahan, James Neal and Michael Frolik also scored for the Flames (8-5-1), who have won three straight. Matthew Tkachuk added three assists. It's already the fourth time this season the Flames have come back to win when trailing after two periods. Colin Wilson, Vladislav Kamenev, Sheldon Dries, Carl Soderberg and Gabriel Landeskog scored for Colorado (7-4-2). Down 4-1 after two periods, Calgary began its comeback 47 seconds into the third on Lindholm's power-play goal, his team-leading ninth goal of the season. The man advantage was the result of a charging major on Ian Cole late in the second period after his heavy hit crumpled Mark Jankowski as he was looking back for a pass. Shaken up, Jankowski went to the dressing room. He returned to sit on the bench in the third period, but did not play. The Flames drew within one at 5:21 when Monahan deflected Noah Hanifin's point shot. The Saddledome crowd then roared at 10:52 when Neal got the puck in the slot and ripped a shot past Varlamov for his third goal and a tie game. Just more than a minute after Giordano's go-ahead goal, Frolik made it a two-goal lead, one-timing Tkachuk's feed for his sixth goal. The Avalanche got a power-play goal from Landeskog at 18:57 to set up a harrowing finish. Landeskog's goal first appeared to be Wilson's second of the game before the Colorado captain was credited with his 11th of the season. Wilson picked up an assist on the play. Mike Smith got the win despite giving up five goals on 26 shots. He improved to 5-4-1. Varlamov, who entered with a 1.62 goals-against average and.950 save percentage, made 31 saves. The five goals he allowed in the third period came on just 11 shots. Calgary was controlling the game, outshooting the Avs 17-4, when a stray pass from Giordano resulted in Kamenev breaking up the ice on a short-handed 2-on-1 and scoring his first career goal. Less than two minutes later, Dries got his first NHL goal, when his rebound banked off the skate of Rasmus Andersson in the slot and went into the net. NOTES: Monahan extended his point streak to five games (two goals, six assists).... Colorado forward Mikko Rantanen has 21 points, tying the franchise record for October set by Joe Sakic in 1996.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","The Alps: Global warming strikes yet again, and this time the victims are the iconic ice caps of the Alps. With rising temperatures, ice throughout this European mountain range is melting. Since many towns around the Alps depend economically on winter sport tourism, they are resorting to covering the snow with blankets and overusing snowmaking machines. The problem is that these machines contribute to global warming, and trap the towns in a vicious cycle of trying to preserve their livelihood in a way that contributes to its destruction.

PARIS Authorities in the French Alps say a 12-year-old boy has been found alive after being buried under an avalanche for 40 minutes.
French police in the town of Bourg Saint-Maurice say the boy was skiing off piste at the La Plagne ski resort in a group of seven skiers Wednesday when he was swept away by a huge mass of snow.
Rescue workers flew in a helicopter to the avalanche scene, which was 2,400 meters (7,875 feet) high up the mountain. A sniffer dog found the boy, whose snowsuit was not equipped with an avalanche detector.
Rescue workers described the operation as miraculous because chances of survival are minuscule after 15 minutes under the snow.
The boy escaped unscathed and was sent to a local hospital for a checkup.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press) DENVER (AP) — Connor McDavid had his third hat trick of the season, and the Edmonton Oilers beat the Colorado Avalanche 4-2 on Sunday to snap a six-game losing streak. McDavid now has 11 goals in the last nine games and two hat tricks. His first two goals tied the game, and his last one was into an empty net at 18:34 of the third.

"USA TODAY Sports, Kevin Allen, USA TODAY Sports","Kings defenseman Drew Doughty will return in Game 3 after a one-game suspension. (Photo: Stephen R. Sylvanie, USA TODAY Sports) The Nashville Predators, Winnipeg Jets, Tampa Bay Lightning and Vegas Golden Knights have converted home-ice advantage into 2-0 leads in their best-of-seven NHL first-round series. Historically, teams that have taken a 2-0 lead in a series go on to win 88.7% of the time. Which of the trailing teams have the best shot of turning around those series? We rank them as they prepare for Game 3: 1. Los Angeles Kings (trailing the Vegas Golden Knights 2-0): The expansion Golden Knights are continuing one of the most impressive team performances in NHL history. This team, which didn't exist during the 2017 playoffs, has engineered two impressive nip-and-tuck wins against a Kings team that boasts multiple players with championship rings. Everyone is running short of superlatives to use about the Knights. But don’t bury the Kings yet. Defenseman Drew Doughty missed Game 2 because of a suspension. He’s back. Plus, these Kings have ample poise and experience to cope with a series deficit. Anze Kopitar and Jeff Carter are capable of taking over a game, and Kings goalie Jonathan Quick has a.964 save percentage in this series. It comes down to the Kings finding a way to eliminate the spell that Vegas goalie Marc-Andre Fleury has on them. He’s in their head. They need to drive traffic in front of him. 2. New Jersey Devils (trailing the Tampa Bay Lightning 2-0): The Devils’ hope centers on the fact they beat the Lightning three times in the regular season. The problem is the Lightning are in playoff mode, and they are the more experienced team. They have a greater understanding of what it takes to be successful in the postseason. The Devils, a surprise playoff qualifier, are trying to learn that now. The Devils put pressure on Tampa Bay in Game 2, forcing Lightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy to be at his best to preserve the win. More: Alex Killorn scores twice as Lightning beat Devils in Game 2 More: Predators hold off Avalanche 5-4 in Game 2 More: Golden Knights beat Kings for team's first OT playoff win More: Announcer joins fight against opioid abuse after son's death The Devils are generating enough shots, 75 in the two games. Taylor Hall has 11. They need to force Vasilevskiy to move more across the crease and to impede his vision with screens. 3. Minnesota Wild (trailing the Winnipeg Jets 2-0): Wild goalie Devan Dubnyk has kept this series closer than it should be. The Jets have outshot the Wild 84-37. The Wild had a 2-1 lead in third period of Game 1, but lost that game 3-2. They lost 4-1 in Game 2. If the Ryan Suter-less Wild want to tighten this series, they need to move the puck more quickly out of their zone. The Jets are forcing the puck deep and preventing the Wild from moving the puck up ice. The Wild haven’t measured up yet to the Jets' pressure. The Wild must find an answer for Patrik Laine, who has two goals and 10 shots on goal in the series. The Wild need Jason Zucker, Eric Staal and Nino Niederreiter to produce. Those three combined for 93 goals in the regular season and have combined for zero points in the first two games. 4. Colorado Avalanche (trailing the Nashville Predators 2-0): Considering the Avalanche were last in the NHL in 2016-17, just qualifying for the playoffs must feel like winning a championship. They’ve already had an exceptional season, and now they are trying their hardest to push back against the Predators, falling 5-4 on Saturday in Game 2. But the bottom line is the Predators are deeper, stronger, better defensively and more accomplished in net. The Predators haven’t found their postseason rhythm yet, but they are in control of this series. Don’t forget the Predators were in the Stanley Cup Final last year while the Avalanche were golfing and boating.

TSN.ca Staff,"Colorado Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar and centre Nathan MacKinnon both downplayed the heated exchange between the two late in Wednesday's loss to the Calgary Flames on Friday.
The exchange came just seconds after Calgary scored an empty-net goal to secure Colorado's eighth loss in nine games. MacKinnon threw a Gatorade bottle in disgust and, after trading words with Bednar, he was so fired up that a calming arm from captain Gabriel Landeskog caused him to fall backwards on the bench. 
On Friday, both Bednar and MacKinnon chalked the exchange up to frustration with the team's recent skid on Friday and said there is no rift.
MacKinnon said that he was shocked at how bad he looked when he saw the highlights on TV later that night.
Thats unacceptable on my part; I cant be doing that stuff. Just frustrated we lost eight of nine, I think (Matthew) Tkachuk had just scored an empty-netter. I was just really frustrated but I love playing for (Bednar). Everyone loves playing for (Bednar) in here and that's on me and I take responsbility for it,"" said MacKinnon. 
MacKinnon, an alternate captain, sits second on the Avalanche in scoring this season with 26 goals and 66 points through 44 games. The 2018 Hart Trophy finalist added that the disagreement stemmed from him thinking the goalie should have been pulled, and said that he and Bednar spoke after the game and they moved on right away.
All of us, at the time, were frustrated. I thought we played two really good games, couldve come out with four points, said Bednar. To me, [the outburst] didnt bother me at all. Thats what I love about Nathan and about certain guys on our team is the fire and passion and emotion they play with. Thats what you need in this game, thats what makes him so good, so I never want to curb that.
Bednar, 46, was hired ahead of the 2016-17 season and had a tough first year, posting a 22-56-4 record behind the bench. The Avalanche, however, rebounded last year to post a 43-30-9 record en route to reaching the postseason for the first time since 2014. The team is currently seventh in the Western Conference.

GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) Brad Richardson and the Arizona Coyotes were tasked with trying to limit the productivity of the Colorado Avalanche's high-scoring top line.
They did just enough Saturday night, and Richardson provided the offense the Coyotes needed down the stretch, scoring twice in the final 3:39 in a 6-4 win over Colorado.
Richardson's ninth goal of the season broke a 4-all tie, and his empty-net goal was his 10th and gave him the team lead in scoring. The empty-netter came with 12 seconds left.
""I just literally tried to shoot as quick as I could on that,"" Richardson said of his first goal. ""Went through two other guys. I don't think the goalie saw it at all.""
Derek Stepan, Christian Fischer and Richard Panik scored for Arizona, and Conor Garland added his first career NHL goal.
Alexander Kerfoot scored twice, and Gabriel Landeskog and Nathan MacKinnon added goals for the Avalanche, who have lost three of four. J.T. Compher and Matt Nieto had two assists for Colorado, which entered in fourth place in the Western Conference.
The Coyotes lost a three-goal lead in the third period as the Avalanche rallied with goals from Landeskog, Kerfoot and MacKinnon to make it 4-4. Landeskog and MacKinnon are part of Colorado's 157-point No. 1 line that didn't score a point until the third.
""We had MacKinnon's line kind of hemmed in quite a bit in their end,"" Richardson said.
""We defended well early,"" Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet said. ""If there's any guy you want to get the goal, for me, it's 'Richie' because he shut down that line. That line is arguably the best line in hockey. He did a great job. That's tough to do.""
The Avalanche went with an extra attacker inside the final two minutes, but to no avail. The Coyotes put an end to a three-game losing streak.
MacKinnon tied it at four with his 22nd of the season at 11:51 of the third. With intensity high, Landeskog and Arizona's Lawson Crouse dropped gloves and exchanged blows.
Both were given five minutes for fighting with 7:35 to play, Landeskog getting the better of the fight.
It didn't give the Avalanche momentum, however, as the Coyotes finished strong despite having lost seven of the previous eight games.
""The third was not fancy, it wasn't cute, it wasn't east-west, it was all the things we wanted it to be,"" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. ""Up-tempo, physical, involved, passionate. That's the way we have to play. That's the way we were playing at the beginning of the year.""
Panik gave the Coyotes a first-period lead with his left-handed wrister at 8:58. He scored off a pass from Stepan for his seventh goal of the season.
Hill got his pad on Sven Andrighetto's centering pass in deep, but the puck caromed right to Kerfoot, who stuffed in the rebound at 18:13 of the first to tie the game.
It was Kerfoot's first goal since Nov. 14.
Clayton Keller fanned on a shot, but Stepan was nearby to shoot the puck past Philipp Grubauer with five seconds left in the period, and Arizona had momentum with a 2-1 lead to start the second period.
The Coyotes' third goal was almost all due to the handiwork of Nick Schmaltz, who handled the puck through defenders before passing, then got on the receiving end of another pass from Alex Galchenyuk that led to Schmaltz's assist to Fischer.
Fischer's eighth goal at 2:30 of the second period gave the Coyotes a two-goal lead. Then Garland hustled to catch up to a long pass from Mario Kempe and beat Grubauer at 8:28.
Grubauer, who had 12 saves, was then removed from net and replaced by Pavel Francouz, who at age 28 made his NHL debut.
Francouz stopped 21 shots. Landeskog's goal was his team-leading 24th of the season.
""We left it all out there in the third,"" Landeskog said. ""If you ask me, I think we deserved more, but that's the way it goes.""
NOTES: Coyotes D Kevin Connauton was scratched for the second straight game. ... D Ilya Lyubushkin recorded his first career NHL point with an assist on Garland's goal. ... The Avalanche called up C Sheldon Dries, Francouz and F A.J. Greer from Colorado of the AHL. Francouz was Grubauer's backup goaltender with Semyon Varlamov out due to illness. Dries was scratched. ... C Colin Wilson, hurt Friday in a loss to Chicago, was placed on injured reserve.

OddsShark Staff,"The Toronto Maple Leafs will be looking to take a 2-0 lead in their opening-round playoff series with the Boston Bruins when they hit the ice for Game 2 on Saturday as +125 underdogs on the NHL betting lines at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.
Toronto received steady performances from up and down the lineup while marching to a decisive 4-1 win in Game 1, and now takes its first playoff series lead against Boston in 60 years into Saturday night’s matchup at TD Garden.
After posting just four wins over the final 14 games of their regular-season schedule, the Maple Leafs received stellar performances from their best players in Game 1 of the series. In addition to Mitch Marner’s two goals, John Tavares chipped in with a goal and an assist while dominating in the faceoff circle, winning 16 of 26 draws, and goaltender Frederik Andersen turned aside 37 of 38 shots.
The Bruins’ top line of Patrice Bergeron, David Pastrnak, and Brad Marchand struggled in comparison to a year ago, when they combined to tally 20 points in the first two games of their first-round series with Toronto, which they eventually won in seven games.
As a result, Boston has taken a tumble at the sportsbooks. After opening the postseason as -145 favourites to claim their sixth playoff series win over Toronto since 1959, the Bruins now lag as +135 underdogs while the Maple Leafs have moved to -155 chalk on the series prices.
The Maple Leafs have also vaulted to +1200 on the Stanley Cup odds after opening the playoffs at a lengthy +1800, and have moved past Boston, which has slipped to +1300.
Later on Saturday night, the scene shifts to Scotiabank Saddledome as the Calgary Flames take on the Colorado Avalanche in Game 2 of their Pacific Division semi-final matchup as heavy -230 favourites.
The Flames outclassed Colorado in a 4-0 win to open the series on Thursday night, and have now claimed victory in nine of 10 dates with the Avalanche since March 2016.
Calgary had produced mixed results since clinching a playoff spot in mid-March, falling to defeat in four of their final seven regular-season outings, but have continued to play stingy hockey, surrendering just 1.85 goals per game over their past 13 contests.
Conversely, the Avalanche have now lost four straight on the road, and have tumbled to +330 on the series prices, while the Flames have risen to +550 on the Stanley Cup odds.","Maple Leafs underdogs, Flames favourites on Saturday NHL odds Sportsnet.ca Nylander feels like he's 'getting the full mojo back' TSN Rival Watch: What they’re saying about Leafs’, Flames’ Game 1 wins Sportsnet.ca Toronto Maple Leafs Win Game One and Mike Babc…",2019-04-13T02:31:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sportsnet.ca'}","Maple Leafs underdogs, Flames favourites on Saturday NHL odds - Sportsnet.ca",https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/maple-leafs-underdogs-flames-favourites-saturday-nhl-odds/,https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NHL-Flames-Smith-makes-stop-against-Avalanche.jpg,,Sportsnet.ca,avalanche,1

Baptiste Assmann,"An API gateway is a layer of software between the frontend UI and backend services that routes requests intelligently. Read on to learn how HAProxy Enterprise Edition excels as an API gateway. Danger! Avalanche Area is a sign youll see when you drive through some parts of Colorado. Looking at the surrounding mountains in winter, you get the feeling that youre creeping by sleeping giants that might pour down a surge of snow at any moment. If that werent enough, driving alone through such a place can seem like if you were to be buried, would anyone ever know? In your work as an IT operator, the weight of managing modern IT systems can give you the same, anxious feeling. The complexity that builds up in infrastructure is like snow forming on a mountainside. If you get buried, how long will it take before people know? Youve got to offload complexity wherever you can! The specific form of complexity that well address here is of connecting internal microservices to the outside world. Internal functionality, such as authentication, retrieving customer data, fetching product details, and taking payments must be exposed to your frontend clients. This is accomplished by defining application programming interfaces (APIs) that express these function signatures. The challenge is that having clients connect directly to backend APIs creates tight coupling between the frontend and backend components, which is difficult to manage and scale. The way to handle this, and even get some observability over whos calling what, is to consolidate the way that external clients access your APIs. Combining disparate APIs behind a single, unifying URL is the purview of an API gateway. In this way, clients can maintain a single reference to the gateway and it will route them to the right place. You also get a smaller area that needs to be exposed to the Internet. An Open-Source API Gateway An API gateway is a layer of software between the client and backend services that routes requests intelligently. HAProxy, the worlds fastest and most widely used software load balancer, fills the role as an API gateway extremely well. In addition to routing API calls for /cart or /catalog to the proper backend services, it also handles load balancing, security, rate limiting, monitoring, and other cross-cutting concerns. In essence, by placing all of your APIs behind a shared HAProxy instance, these requirements can be offloaded. The API gateway becomes the orchestration layer that forwards requests so that frontend code and backend API endpoints are not tightly coupled. All devices can point to a single domain and HAProxy will handle the routing. Here are some of the functions that an HAProxy API gateway will handle for you: High Performance Load balancing HTTP routing Security Rate limiting Observability Connection queuing Circuit-breaking Authentication Device Detection Lets explore some of these features in more detail. HTTP Routing The primary role of the API gateway is to route an incoming client request to the appropriate internal service. HAProxy can route based on any information found in the HTTP request, including portions of the URL path, query string, and HTTP headers. In the following example, our HAProxy configuration sets up a frontend that accepts incoming requests on port 443, checks their URL paths for /cart and /catalog, and then forwards them to the correct backend. frontend api_gateway bind :443 ssl crt /etc/hapee-1.8/certs/cert.pem acl PATH_cart path_beg -i /cart acl PATH_catalog path_beg -i /catalog use_backend be_cart if PATH_cart use_backend be_catalog if PATH_catalog backend be_cart server s1 10.0.0.3:80 backend be_catalog server s1 10.0.0.5:80 If you are managing multiple website domains, then you can check the Host header when determining how to route requests. Heres an example that will segregate API requests depending on the domain. When accessing, for example, api.haproxy.com, it will only route requests for /catalog and /cart. B2B partners that access partner.haproxy.com can access the /inventory API. frontend api_gateway bind :443 ssl crt /etc/hapee-1.8/certs/cert.pem acl VHOST_publicapi req.hdr(Host) -i -m dom api.haproxy.com api.haproxy.fr acl VHOST_partnersapi req.hdr(Host) -i -m dom partner.haproxy.com partner.haproxy.fr acl PATH_catalog path_beg -i /catalog acl PATH_cart path_beg -i /cart acl PATH_inventory path_beg -i /inventory use_backend be_cart if VHOST_publicapi PATH_cart use_backend be_catalog if VHOST_publicapi PATH_catalog use_backend be_inventory if VHOST_partnersapi PATH_inventory backend be_cart server s1 10.0.0.3:80 backend be_catalog server s1 10.0.0.5:80 backend be_inventory server s1 10.0.0.7 Note that HAProxy is extremely flexible and powerful and the examples provided are just simple use cases. HAProxy can apply more complex logic for HTTP routing and request handling. If an application requires tens, hundreds, or even thousands of paths in a single ACL, then it is better to manage them through a map file. A map file stores key/value associations in memory. In our example, the key would be the host/path string and the value would be the name of the backend to route the request to. The map file routing.map would contain: # endpoint backend name api.haproxy.com/catalog/ be_catalog api.haproxy.fr/catalog/ be_catalog api.haproxy.com/cart/ be_cart api.haproxy.fr/cart/ be_cart partner.haproxy.com/inventory/ be_inventory partner.haproxy.fr/inventory/ be_inventory Our HAProxy configuration would contain: frontend api_gateway # use_backend %[base,map_beg(/etc/hapee-1.8/routing.map)] Did You Know? The base fetch method returns the concatenation of the Host header and the path part of the request, which starts at the first slash and ends before the question mark. To simplify the process of adding or removing path-to-backend associations, you can enable the HAProxy Enterprise Edition lb-update module. This module can read the contents of the map file and refresh the ACLs during runtime, without the need to reload HAProxy. Load Balancing In order to improve the performance and resilience of each API endpoint, its recommended to replicate the service over several nodes. Then, the API gateway will balance incoming client requests among them. You can adjust the load balancing algorithm to suit the type of service and protocol. For quick and short API calls, use the roundrobin algorithm For longer-lived websockets, use the leastconn algorithm For services that have backend servers optimized to process particular functions, use the uri algorithm In the following example, the mobile API backend is balanced across two nodes using the roundrobin algorithm. backend mobile_api balance roundrobin server s1 10.0.0.3:80 server s2 10.0.0.4:80 Load balancing your API endpoints improves performance and creates redundancy. Note that you can choose the most appropriate balancing algorithm on a per-backend basis. You can also define active and passive health checks for your servers so that HAProxy automatically reroutes traffic if theres a problem. In the following example, we monitor the health of our servers by sending GET requests to the /health URL and expecting a successful response. backend mobile_api balance roundrobin option httpchk GET /health server s1 10.0.0.3:80 check server s2 10.0.0.4:80 check The option httpchk directive sets the method and URL to monitor. If you append \r\n you can add additional HTTP headers to this request. A check parameter is added to each server to enable the feature. Being able to watch a URL endpoint works well with tools like Prometheus that already expose a /metrics web page used for scraping metrics. HAProxy maxconn The HAProxy load balancer stands in a strategic position, between your clients and services, ensuring that no backend nodes are saturated by spikes in traffic. Without this, all requests would be forwarded to the backend servers, risking high wait times and timeouts. HAProxy implements queuing mechanisms to prevent sending too many requests at once to a service. Add the maxconn argument to a server directive to queue additional requests within the gateway, as shown: backend mobile_api balance roundrobin server s1 10.0.0.3:80 maxconn 100 server s2 10.0.0.4:80 maxconn 100 In this case, up to 100 connections can be established at once to a server. Any more than that will be queued. This relieves strain on your servers, allowing them to process requests more efficiently. HAProxy is highly proficient at managing queues of this sort. Rate Limiting You may want to limit the number of requests a client can send to your APIs within a period of time. This might be a to enforce a quota for various tiers of customers. To be allowed to send more requests, clients could subscribe to a higher-priced tier. In HAProxy, stick tables can be used for such a purpose. You can track clients by IP address, cookie or other means such as API tokens passed in the URL or headers. In this example, the client is expected to pass a URL parameter called apitoken and is limited to 1000 requests within 24 hours. The period is set with the expire parameter on the stick-table directive. frontend api_gateway bind :443 ssl crt /etc/hapee-1.8/certs/cert.pem stick-table type string size 1m expire 24h store http_req_cnt acl exceeds_limit url_param(apitoken),table_http_req_cnt(api_gateway) gt 1000 http-request track-sc0 url_param(apitoken) unless exceeds_limit http-request deny deny_status 429 if exceeds_limit Now, as I make requests to the site, passing the URL parameter, apitoken=abcdefg, the count of HTTP requests is incremented. I can see this by logging into the server via SSH and querying the Runtime API. In the following example, Ive made 12 requests using my API token. root@server1:~$ echo ""show table api_gateway"" | socat UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/haproxy.sock stdio # table: api_gateway, type: string, size:1048576, used:1 0x55bd73392fa4: key=abcdefg use=0 exp=86396974 http_req_cnt=12 When clients go past their limit, theyll receive a 429 Too Many Requests response. Check out our blog post Introduction to HAProxy Stick Tables for more information about defining stick tables and other examples of rate limiting. Did You Know? Adding deny_status to the http-request deny directive allows you to set a custom response code when rejecting requests. Possible values are 200, 400, 403, 405, 408, 425, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504 Optionally, instead of a daily limit as used above, you can also do it based on the rate of the requests. This acts as a security feature to prevent abuse or clients with runaway processes. The following example allows a client to make no more than one request per second. ( Note: While the above and below are separate examples they could also be combined to provide extra control) frontend api_gateway bind :443 ssl crt /etc/hapee-1.8/certs/cert.pem stick-table type string size 1m expire 24h store http_req_rate(10s) acl rate_abuse url_param(apitoken),table_http_req_rate(api_gateway) gt 10 http-request track-sc0 url_param(apitoken) unless rate_abuse http-request deny deny_status 429 if rate_abuse Detailed monitoring and statistics HAProxy is very famous for the level of details it provides on the traffic it processes. There are two main features: the statistic dashboard and the logs. Statistics Dashboard You can enable an HTML statistics page within HAProxy and HAProxy Enterprise Edition, which comes as a set of tabular data with many metrics for each frontend, backend, backend server and frontend bind line. The image below shows an example of the HAProxy Enterprise Edition Real Time dashboard: This data is also available by querying the HAProxy Runtime API. JSON (within the Runtime API) and CSV (within both the dashboard and the Runtime API) are also available for easy integration with third party tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and SNMP. The image below shows an integration of HAProxy with Grafana, via the Prometheus exporter: Logs The HAProxy logs are a gold mine of information, since HAProxy can report the following information for each API call: Client IP, port Routing within HAProxy: frontend, backend, server URL endpoint with query string Timers: time for the client to send the request, server connection time, response time, total session duration, etc Termination status: did the session finished properly or not, if not what happened and at what phase of the session (connection time, header time, data streaming time, etc) Any custom header or cookie you want to capture Any SSL / TLS information Based on all the information provided above, it is possible to build reports and to figure out when and where problems are occurring (e.g. Is it networking? The application? A particular server?). Observability We highly recommend watching this video to get tips on observability from the creator of HAProxy, Willy Tarreau, to understand the power of HAProxy in this area: Conclusion In this article, you learned what an API gateway is and how it can simplify connecting microservices to external clients.

"AP, AP","Colorado Avalanche goaltender Philipp Grubauer looks on during a time out against the Montreal Canadiens in the second period of an NHL hockey game Wednesday, Dec. 19, 2018, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)
(Photo: The Associated Press)
DENVER (AP) Gabriel Landeskog got the chance to celebrate his goal a second time after a big sigh of relief.
He thought his score would count despite a challenge for goaltender interference. But really he wasn't sure. It's hard to be completely sure.
The Colorado captain broke a tie 35 seconds into the third period by batting in a goal, Philipp Grubauer stopped 35 shots and the Avalanche beat the Montreal Canadiens 2-1 on Wednesday night.
""It was one of those that could have gone either way,"" Landeskog said.
That's what infuriated goaltender Carey Price and the Canadiens.
This is how the play unfolded: Landeskog's initial shot bounced off the chest of Price and the forward knocked it in out of midair as he and Montreal's Jonathan Drouin crashed into Price. Landeskog celebrated as the Canadiens challenged that it was goaltender interference. The goal was upheld on replay and Landeskog celebrated again by tossing down his water bottle in exuberance.
""I disagree with the call,"" Price said.
His coach had his back.
""It's 50-50 now,"" said Claude Julien, who coached his 300th game with Montreal. ""Anytime we challenge a call, we know we say, 'We're tossing a coin here.' We have no idea how they're going to call it.
""What we saw was the initial collision was Landeskog and our goaltender, which if there's not that collision, he freezes the puck. They can look at the second one and say our guy pushed our goaltender even further, but that's after the original collision. That's why our goaltender doesn't agree with the call. That's why I support him on that.""
Price is even more confused about the rule.
""I don't know what it is. I just think if your ability is impeded to make a move to the puck I think it's pretty clear,"" said Price, whose team started a six-game trip that's broken up by the holiday break. ""They had a different opinion on the contact.""
Mikko Rantanen had a goal and an assist to give him an NHL-leading 58 points. He's followed by teammate Nathan MacKinnon, who has 55 points after a two-assist evening. Landeskog, the third member of their high-flying line, scored his team-best 23rd goal.
Price, who stopped 24 shots, came up short in his bid for his 300th career victory. He's trying to become the 35th goaltender to reach that milestone.
Brendan Gallagher had a power-play goal for Montreal, breaking the Canadiens' 0 for 25 dry spell with the man advantage.
Grubauer only got stronger throughout the night in improving to 8-0-3 over his last 11 starts. He started in place of a struggling Semyon Varlamov.
""I just felt (Grubauer) looked really solid in the net, like he was in control of the game,"" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. ""I haven't felt that way about our goaltending for the last little bit, and that's what we need. We need those guys to take control of it and to be real sharp and on top of their game and give us a chance to sort of find ourselves.""
Trailing 1-0 early in the second, Colorado capitalized on a mistake by Price. He tried to play the puck to the side had it intercepted by MacKinnon, who dished it over to Rantanen for the goal.
""I just tried to yell for Nate and he made a quick pass and Price couldn't recover,"" Rantanen said. ""It was a good play by Nate.""
With two goals and three assists, Colorado's top line of Landeskog, MacKinnon and Rantanen have now amassed a combined 155 points. Asked if that unit proved difficult to contain, Julien pointed out that one of their scores was off a turnover and the other a disputed goal.
""I don't think they burned us,"" Julien said. ""If anything, our guys played well against them.""
NOTES: Canadiens LW Charles Hudon was back in the lineup after not dressing in the last nine games. ... Avs D Nikita Zadorov left with a lower-body injury.

Joe Skrebels,"“It was kind of one of those things where you meet in a bar. You look at each other, and you fall in love.” By Joe Skrebels Studio director Tim Willits tells me that he can’t remember whether it was Id Software or Avalanche Studios that spoke to the other first. “It was kind of one of those things where you meet in a bar,” he explains, “you look at each other, and you fall in love.” Rage 2’s a passion project for many reasons - it’s the sequel to a game that never quite lived up to its promise, the chance to realise its original open world vision, and, yes, make up for that underwhelming ending - but, honestly, the passion that comes through strongest is from each of its developers to the other. It’s an improbably perfect match. Id is now almost inarguably seen as the king of first-person shooters, having somehow made a Doom sequel that lived up to the franchise's own towering legacy. Avalanche, meanwhile, blazed a trail into emergent open worlds, often making those that followed look thoughtless by comparison. When it comes to Rage 2 - a first-person open world action game - this feels less like a development partnership and more like a supergroup. Willits calls it a marriage. In part, it’s a marriage of convenience. As Willits puts it, it’s difficult ""to make all the games all the time"", and Avalanche provided an outlet for Id to make a game it otherwise might not have been able to provide the requisite resources for. But the Swedish studio seemingly brought much more than just manpower. Avalanche had been in discussion with Id for years, according to game director Magnus Nedfors, but when it came to actually deciding on a project, there was nothing other than Rage 2 suggested. It was too neat a fit. Willits puts it well when he says working alongside Avalanche makes the original dream for Rage possible. The first game was constrained by technology of the time, shifting from an open world shooter into a more linear, story-driven affair. For the sequel, that’s no longer the case. The Swedish studio brings its own Apex engine, its massive experience with emergent open worlds, and a knowledge of how to achieve non-linear storytelling, while Id can push what it learned about high-speed combat from Doom 2016 into a wider context. Considering Rage is Id’s baby, it’s a little surprising to find out that Avalanche is leading the project. The bulk of the development team is in the Stockholm studio, while Id drops in more staff for support or advisory roles. It’s tempting to think that Id would be making its stock-in-trade, the gunplay, and “plugging” it into an Avalanche world, but even that is primarily being developed in Sweden. Nedfors says it’s been interesting to learn from the masters of the FPS genre, particularly Willits himself, who he calls a legend. Avalanche has been learning about controller dead zones, animation frame counts, and the nitty-gritty that makes a good shooter feel great. On the other side, Willits says he’s learned a lot about open world storytelling, non-scripted events and what simply doesn’t work in an open world game - you can’t really kick off a dialogue driven cutscene if you can just as easily drive a tank through the back door as walk in through the front. Both developers are taking away lessons from the other that could come in useful in their future. But for now, both sides working on the game seems simply happy to be working together in this strange creative marriage. Willits praises Just Cause 3’s sheer madness, Nedfors gushes about Doom’s push-forward combat. Both discuss their studios’ development blind spots, and how the other is helping cover them. Willits is clear that he’d like to keep working with Avalanche once this project is done. It truly feels like a love story - except the eventual baby will arrive toting a gun the size of a cathedral. I can’t wait. Joe Skrebels is IGN's UK News Editor, and this is his favourite dev team-up since Platinum and Nintendo.

"AP, AP","Golden Knights fans erupt as Vegas clinches a playoff berth. (Photo: Stephen R. Sylvanie, USA TODAY Sports) LAS VEGAS (AP) — William Karlsson and Jonathan Marchessault each scored to help the expansion Vegas Golden Knights clinch a playoff spot with a 4-1 win over the Colorado Avalanche on Monday night. The Golden Knights became the first team to reach the playoffs in its inaugural season since the league expanded for the 1967-68 season. It was also the 200th career victory for coach Gerard Gallant. Alex Tuch and Shea Theodore also scored for Vegas, and Marc-Andre Fleury improved to 28-11-4 after stopping 28 shots. The Golden Knights host San Jose on Saturday and are six points in front of the Sharks in the Pacific Division. San Jose beat Chicago in overtime earlier Monday. Erik Johnson scored for the Avalanche and Semyon Varlamov made 26 saves. The Avalanche are fourth in the Central Division but hold the top wild card in the Western Conference, just in front of St. Louis. The following focuses on the @GoldenKnights ’ achievement as it relates to NHL history, dating back to 1917-18. Playing under different rules and circumstances, 11 other franchises reached the playoffs in their first NHL season. #NHLStats #StanleyCup pic.twitter.com/vMPTRCJkVs — NHL Public Relations (@PR_NHL) March 27, 2018 Tuch was in the right spot on Vegas' first power play to punch home a loose puck and give the Golden Knights a 1-0 lead. Colorado tied it when Johnson was there to fire in a rebound. Vegas went back up 2-1 when Marchessault beat Varlamov with a slick wrist shot. Vegas has scored with a man advantage in 20 of its last 31 games. The Golden Knights wasted no time in extending their lead in the third period, when Erik Haula fed a streaking Theodore, who put one past Varlamov at the 1:31 mark. Karlsson closed out the scoring with an empty-net goal, his 40th of the season. Colorado is 11-7-3 against the Pacific Division and dropped to 7-3-3 in March. The Avalanche are still riding a 9-3-3 streak but had a three-game road winning streak snapped.

Michael McWhertor,"Rage 2 looks like a blast, at least in the hands of Tim Willits, studio director at id Software. 
I watched Willits play around with the murdering tools of Rage 2 for a few minutes before I played it myself in a Manhattan bar last week, and he was clearly having fun turning post-apocalyptic mutants into human salsa in a gray, developers-only sandbox.
Playing Rage 2 immediately after Willits demo, out there in the games dusty-but-recovering colorful wastelands, I had less fun than he appeared to. I hadnt mastered the combination of guns and superhuman powers that fuel the (unexpected) sequel to 2011s Rage. I played it like a modern shooter, for the most part, only remembering to use my mutant-wrecking powers when I was really in a bind. I worked to come to grips with Rage 2s flow, but never fell into the satisfying gunplay-powered groove of the other recent id Software games, Doom and Wolfenstein.
Id Software is making Rage 2 with Avalanche Studios, using the latter game makers Apex Engine. That id-Avalanche collaboration has resulted in a game that, based on an hour-plus with it, highlights each studios strengths. Theres a bit of frenetic corridor shooting with big, chunky guns. Theres a lot of open-world exploration in heavily armored vehicles that look ripped out of Avalanches Mad Max game, only spray-painted pink and powered by glowing cyan fuel cells. You can even fly around in a dronelike aircraft if you want to watch Rage 2s carnage from high in the sky. 
Im unsure whether any of that will jell to match the satisfying demon-slaying and Nazi-killing of ids other games, or the chaotic violence of Avalanches Just Cause or if both teams efforts will result in some utopian combination of the two.
Its not for a lack of ways to inflict carnage. Rage 2 promises a weapon wheels worth of guns that range from empowering to just silly. There are the requisite meaty pistols, a rail gun (but no sniper rifles; the developers want you to get up close with your victims), a hulking rocket launcher, and a hefty shotgun. Theres also the made-for-YouTube Grav-dart Launcher. That weapon fires bullets into a body or an object, and those bullets launch whatever theyre lodged into toward a target determined by the player. Using the Grav-dart Launcher, you can send enemies hurtling into the sky or throw an exploding barrel at a cluster of bad guys.
Watch Rage 2s weapons and nanotrite abilities in action in this overview video.
When I watched Willits play, he got more creative: He fired Grav-darts into a mutant, then erected a force field and placed the darts destination on the opposite side of that force field. His enemy became a bloody paste as their body attempted to travel through the impenetrable barrier.
There are all kinds of tools in Rage 2 that use technology thats indistinguishable from magic. Players can fill a bad guy with bullets, then snap their fingers and set those bullets on fire. They can act like a Jedi, force-pushing enemies hundreds of feet away. A meter fills up as you play, and when triggered, it supercharges all of your guns. Its called Overdrive, and its one of the spell-like abilities powered by nanotrites, the tiny robots that enhance our heros biology. Its where the gameplay loop of Rage 2 may ultimately pay off; it certainly makes the games guns pack a more enjoyable punch.
I had access to only a handful of nanotrite abilities, like the aforementioned Fus Ro Dah-esque shove known as Shatter and the ground pound called Slam. As Rage 2s hero, Walker, who can be either male or female, I can double-jump and even hover in the air, thanks to nanotrites. Walker also has an ability known as the Vortex Grenade, a mini black hole that sucks in bad guys and then barfs them back out. I could even use the Vortex Grenade to launch myself into the air, if I wanted to get acrobatic.
Thats clearly what id and Avalanche are hoping for: player creativity in gunfights. After I spent some time with Rage 2, Willits said that the developers arent directly incentivizing creative violence; they just want people to experiment and have fun with the toolbox of destruction.
id Software, Avalanche Studios/Bethesda Softworks
The section of Rage 2 I played took place in and around a settlement called Wellspring. Very little of the games ability tree seemed available to me, though I was outfitted with a few guns and abilities. I met up with Loosum Hagar, the mayor of Wellspring, who wanted information from a wealthy local named Klegg Clayton. But to get a meeting with Klegg, I first had to prove myself worthy of entering his club, and being neither rich nor famous, I took the doormans advice and ventured into the wastes to make a name for myself.
I had to check two boxes in my pursuit of fame: Survive an episode of the television show Mutant Bash TV and secure first place in a race called the ChazCar Derby. The former turned out to be exactly what I thought it was a Smash TV-like, wave-based game of death. It was a good place to get familiar with Rage 2s guns and, thanks to the tight quarters of a sequence of arenas, the Shatter and Slam abilities. Mutant Bash TV stood out mainly for its zany supporting cast, consisting of a horny hostess and her underwear-clad, baby doll head-wearing servants. This is not a grim game.
My race in the ChazCar Derby was less engaging, but I learned a trick or two about how to control Rage 2s nitro-powered vehicles. The music they played, perfect driving-music metal, was great. But it was actually the drive between the Mutant Bash TV set and the racetrack where a towering mountain of a woman offered me an extremely indecent proposal when I became most interested in Rage 2. The world is filled with side activities and landmarks to explore. One suggested that I destroy a bunch of fuel tanks in a tiny outpost held by some mutants, but after blowing up half of them, my attention wandered. Far more intriguing was a small fleet of scary-looking ships that warped in right above a group of very powerful-looking enemies who immediately opened fire on my ride, a stolen monster truck. It was obvious I was seriously outmatched, so I got the hell out of Dodge, enticed by what was sure to kill me.
Those little pockets of activity and Rage 2 seems to have hundreds looked like a lot of fun.
id Software, Avalanche Studios/Bethesda Softworks
Theres a deep, multi-tiered tree of skills and upgrades in Rage 2. Theyre split up into three categories: combat, engineering, and nanotrite upgrades. In order to progress through each, youll need to do favors and complete activities for three key characters: the local sheriff, John Marshall; Mayor Hagar; and Dr. Antonin Kvasir, the scientist who helped players overthrow the evil Authority in the original Rage. 
The only favor I did as part of unlocking the tech tree was to plant a bug on Klegg Claytons computer for Mayor Hagar, a trick that Clayton appreciated so little that he sent me down into a killing room where I was attacked by a giant mutant hillbilly named Rukkus. I fired dozens of shotgun blasts into that thing, frantically dashed and dodged, and died a dozen times trying to take it down. The battle was frustrating and funky, to the point where I started to question if I was actually enjoying Rage 2s gunplay and controls. I wondered whether Rage 2 would feel as good as Wolfenstein or Doom when the game comes out in a few months.
Theres time for Avalanche and id to iron out those kinds of concerns. The build was months old anyway, Willits told me. And there were promising things I didnt get to experience. Much of the demo, which was set about 25 percent into the main campaign, was locked out to me, and I played as Bethesda suggested, on Windows PC using an Xbox controller. There was also a mysterious convoy battle apparently pretty difficult teased on the demos main menu that I didnt get to see. Nor did we explore Rage 2s numerous biomes, which go beyond sun-drenched desert wastelands to verdant swamplands and snowy mountaintops.
Still, were getting a sequel to Rage. And it looks more interesting than that dry, all-shades-of-brown game, thanks to its colorful personality and palette of ways to kill things. Im fascinated to see how it all comes together.
Rage 2 is scheduled to be released on May 14. The game is coming to PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. Willits said that id and Bethesda are investigating a Nintendo Switch version of the game as well.","Rage 2 is coming to PC, PS4, and Xbox One on May 14.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"One nice thing about teddy bears is that if your dog tears the head off of your child’s favorite one, you can just sew it back on. But you don’t proclaim your achievement a “wild success”—rather, you say, “here, I have fixed your lifeless play-thing.” Yet here comes Sergio Canavero, the controversial Italian doctor who just announced that he had performed a head transplant operation on a teddy bear made of bone-stuffed human meat. The announcement has come with an avalanche of news coverage claiming that the move was the first successful head transplant. Scientists have been toying with the idea for about as long as organ transplantation has been around. Canavero himself announced human transplants would be possible in 2015. He says that research centers in the United States are unsupportive, reports USA Today. He claimed he performed the surgery on a monkey in 2016 but without reattaching the spinal cord and without a published paper. He went on to publish several papers claiming to sever and reattach animal spinal cords, but the papers don’t make clear whether he completely detaches or only mostly cuts through the cord before the procedure. These papers also didn’t have controls. His team published another paper this year, but once again didn’t report whether they completely severed the head. Needless to say, scientists are skeptical. This morning, Canavero claimed in a press conference that he’d “realized the first human head transplant,” reports The Telegraph, and that a “full head swap between brain dead organ donors is the next stage.” He followed by calling a full-on head transplant “imminent.” If you cut a tumor out of a corpse, you did not cure the corpse of cancer—you carved a slice of meat off of a raw roast. If you swap cadaver heads, it’s no different from sewing a drumstick to the wrong rotisserie chicken. USA Today reports that Canavero has a volunteer, a paralyzed Russian named Valery Spridonov, and that the procedure would go as follows: Recipient and donor will placed [sic] in a sitting position to facilitate what’s expected to be more about 24 hours of gory, laborious work to separate and then reconnect vertebral bones, jugular veins, the trachea, esophagus and other neck structures. The recipient will be helped to breathe, and blood pumped around the body, with machines. The patient will be kept in drug-induced coma for an unspecified recovery time. It’s totally possible that everything Canavero has done is honest, a head transplant is imminent, his procedure will work, and our skepticism is unwarranted. After all, he’s pretty much the only person who is doing this procedure, and ultimately crazy ideas are required to push boundaries. But this is science. Very little study has been done on this procedure or its risks. And with something so radical, if it’s not studied in an open, honest, and realistic way, then it’s hard for others to take it seriously. So until we see some evidence of an actual head transplant where a spine is completely severed and reattached on something other than raw meat, we’re going to remain skeptical.

"AP, AP","Colorado Avalanche's Gabriel Landeskog, left, of Sweden, hits the puck away from Anaheim Ducks' Andrew Cogliano during the first period of an NHL hockey game Sunday, April 1, 2018, in Anaheim, Calif. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) (Photo: The Associated Press) ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Ondrej Kase scored 1:34 into overtime and the Anaheim Ducks rallied from a two-goal deficit to beat the Colorado Avalanche 4-3 on Sunday night. Andrew Cogliano had a goal and an assist, and Adam Henrique and Ryan Kesler also scored for the Ducks, who moved into third place in the Pacific Division. Anaheim is one point ahead of Los Angeles with three games remaining for both teams. Kase was looking to shoot all the way on a 2-on-1 break and won it by going to the short side over Jonathan Bernier's right shoulder. Ryan Miller made 19 saves after replacing John Gibson at the start of the second period, helping the Ducks to their fifth straight home win. Gibson, who made 10 saves before departing, appeared to be shaken up late in the first when Gabriel Landeskog was cross-checked by Kesler into the goalie, who was being evaluated for an undisclosed injury. Tyson Jost scored twice and Alexander Kerfoot had a goal and an assist for Colorado, which passed St. Louis for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference. The Avalanche lead the Blues by one point, but St. Louis has four games remaining to Colorado's three. Bernier made 28 saves. Henrique cut the Ducks' deficit to 3-2 with 7:43 left in the third with a sharp-angle shot, and Kesler tied it 3-all at 9:19. Jost put the Avalanche up 2-1 at 1:04 of the second, scoring for the second game in a row on a backhand for a power-play goal, and he made it 3-1 at 12:10. The Avalanche took a 1-0 lead 1:16 into the game when Kerfoot got his 18th goal under unusual circumstances. Kerfoot won a faceoff against Rickard Rakell in the right circle and flicked the puck to his left, where it struck Corey Perry's stake and redirected in. But the Ducks tied it at 1 on a breakaway by Andrew Cogliano at 6:08. Cogliano held off shooting from the slot and instead pulled back to his left to get Bernier out of his crease, leaving a shot into an open net for his 10th goal.

"AP, AP","MONTREAL (AP) Carey Price stopped 28 shots for his third shutout of the season as the Montreal Canadiens beat the Colorado Avalanche 3-0 on Saturday night.
Brett Kulak, Jesperi Kotkaniemi and Jordie Benn all scored in the third period for the Canadiens, who had lost three of their last four games. Price got his 43rd career shutout.
Semyon Varlamov gave up two goals on 30 shots for the slumping Avalanche, losers of nine of their last 10.
After two scoreless periods, Kulak scored his second of the season to break the deadlock. With the Canadiens playing short-handed, Kulak scored right off a faceoff in Colorado's zone at 8:21 of the third.
The goal revitalized the home side and Kotkaniemi made it 2-0 at 10:39 on a one-timer after nifty stick work by Jonathan Drouin along the half-wall.
Benn added an empty-netter with 1:16 left.
Colorado has dropped the first three games on its current five-game Canadian road trip.
With Montreal's recent scoring woes five goals in its previous four games coach Claude Julien shuffled his top three lines to provide a spark on offense. Brendan Gallagher and Phillip Danault were moved to the top line with Drouin, and Max Domi was dropped to center the second line. Tomas Tatar, who's played the entire season with Gallagher and Danault, was demoted to the third line alongside rookie Kotkaniemi and Paul Byron.
Julien also tweaked his two power-play units, to no avail. Montreal's league-worst power play went 0 for 3. Montreal's best chance with the man advantage came four minutes into the third period when captain Shea Weber's one-timer hit the post.
Price was solid between the pipes, making key saves to keep the Canadiens in the game. In the first, Price made a hard glove save look easy when Tyson Jost walked in all alone. In the third, the 31-year-old stopped Matt Calvert on the breakaway.

"USA TODAY, Kevin Allen, USA TODAY","SAN JOSE, Calif. - Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin believed he needed a break badly enough that he accepted a one-game suspension in order to sit out the All-Star Game.
Colorado Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon took a different approach.
Bothered by a badly bruised foot, MacKinnon won’t participate in the Skills Competition or All-Star Game, but showed up to be part of the festivities.
Under NHL rules, if a player takes part in the festivities, even if he doesn’t compete, he doesn’t have to sit out a game. That’s the penalty for players who skip the event.
""It’s not broken, just really sore, swollen still. I am not going to force it this weekend,” MacKinnon said. “Also, I like to be here … but I’d get suspended. I was forced, but I do love coming to this. It’s still fun. I’m still the captain. Going to get my jersey and take a couple of pictures.”

The Avalanche, barely holding a wild-card spot with a 22-20-8 record, are 3-7 in their last 10 games. MacKinnon didn’t feel like he could afford to sit out a regular-season game.
“It’s all good – glad to be here,” MacKinnon said.

Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby is going to play in Saturday's game, but won’t take part in the skills event because he is ill.
U.S. women's hockey team player Kendall Coyne will replace MacKinnon in the fastest skater contest.
MacKinnon will get time off to rest his foot because the Avalanche are going on their team break. They don’t play until Feb. 2.
He said he has looked forward to All-Star Weekend.
“It’s definitely lighthearted,” MacKinnon said. “Every day you go to the locker room, it’s very intense, and everyone is pretty focused. But everyone around here is light and loose.""
Fans at the Skills Competition might be disappointed because MacKinnon is an exceptional skater. Could he have challenged Connor McDavid as fastest skater?
“I get killed every year, so I’m happy I don’t have to do it,” MacKinnon said. “Connor is so fast.”

"USA TODAY, Jason Armesto, USA TODAY","USA TODAY Sports got an exclusive look inside the Wasatch Backcountry Rescue International Dog School which trains dogs for avalanche rescue response.
 USA TODAY Sports
ALTA, Utah — There is no good answer for how to survive an avalanche.
The most effective solution is prevention. Consult the forecast, recognize the signs, and play it safe. But part of what makes avalanches so terrifying – besides that they reach speeds of 60 mph, besides that the impact alone can be fatal and besides the thought of suffocating under the crushing weight of a massive pile of snow – is their unpredictability. So while even the most savvy skier or snowboarder may take precautions, anyone can experience an unlucky day.
But if that day comes, the best way to survive may be with the help of an avalanche-rescue dog.
The Wasatch Backcountry Rescue (WBR) International Dog School prepares Avalanche Rescue K-9 teams for those moments. USA TODAY Sports got an exclusive look in January at the semi-annual, four-day program that brings in dogs and their handlers from around the world to educate them on how to respond when they get the call no ski patroller wants to hear.

“Honestly,” said Heather Dent, a dog-school student and handler of a small Australian cattle dog, “I hope to never deploy her. That is the goal. I never want to work my dog for real, but if I have to we’ll be good. She’s ready.”
Over the past decade, an average of 27 people have died in avalanches each year.  While WBR does not track the number of rescues its graduates are responsible for, the school that was founded in 1976 has trained hundreds of teams, who then spread the live-saving knowledge across the globe.
Opinion: Her legacy secure, Lindsey Vonn should focus on life after skiing
Once a victim is stuck in an avalanche, the clock moves fast. WBR president Tracy Christiansen said unless there is an air pocket, a person's chance of survival drops significantly after 3-5 minutes. 
“Miracles have happened when people have survived 40 minutes,” WBR president Tracy Christiansen said. “I’ve heard stories of up to 20 hours where they’ve been in air pockets and been able to survive. So those things do happen. That’s why we always believe in going for the live find.”
Christiansen urges visitors to “always be searchable,” never travel alone and always carry a tracking device. And if a victim can’t perform a self-rescue and doesn’t have some form of location technology, “the dogs are their only chance,"" he said.
Dogs are selected by ski patrollers as puppies and begin training when they are a few months old. From the moment they meet, dog and handler are inseparable.

Marshall Thomson is a ski patroller in Crested Butte, Colo., but drove to southeast Nebraska to pick up his dog from a breeder at just 8 weeks old. The 12-hour ride back took 36 hours when Thomson and his puppy encountered what he describes as the worst snowstorm he’s seen in his life. 
“We were cuddled up in a sleeping bag in the middle of the highway,” Thomson said. “I didn’t know if she’d ever go out in snow after that storm because it was pretty brutal.
Thomson named the puppy Skadi after the Nordic goddess of winter as a nod to the blizzard. Today, they are one of five teams attending the WBR school thanks to a scholarship from Subaru, a partner of the National Ski Patrol, a non-profit founded in 1938 that has more than 30,000 ski patrollers working to keeping people safe on mountains across the country. 
Skadi and the other 23 dogs in attendance last month started every morning with obedience training. Two dozen dogs, each in a brightly-colored harness that made them easier for the handler to carry, lined up at the snowy base of the mountain just outside of the cozy Alta Peruvian Lodge. Handlers looked at their dogs, calmly said ""down,"" and their animals plopped onto the snow in near unison.
To test the dog’s self-restraint, handlers began to walk away, then returned, then walked circles around their dog. The dog laid in the snow, turning its head from left to right as the handler changed direction. The dogs' eyes followed the humans with curiosity, as if to say, “I don’t know why you’re walking around when you could just hang out here with me, but I’ll be waiting until you do.”
The dogs are taught to search for human scent and dig once they find its strongest source. To simulate a real avalanche emergency, a handler – along with a USA TODAY Sports reporter – climbed into a man-made snow cave that was sealed with snow. Inside was a tight squeeze but quiet and protective from the cold wind outside.
“When an avalanche victim is buried,” said Christiansen, “they don’t have the luxury of being in a snow cave. There’s tons of snow. It’s in their face, it’s in their mouth, it’s in their ears. It’s a terrible place for a victim to be.”
While this cave had no shortage of oxygen, it was not for the claustrophobic, and there was a tremendous sense of relief to hear a dog sniffing outside and see a wet nose bust through the snow.
From outside the cave, the dog looked up at its handler until given the magic word: ""Search!""
The animal took off into the powder, walking with its nose to the ground until its head jolted up. The dog found the scent. It got closer and closer to the snow cave until it was certain it had found the source. Once there it began furiously digging, and within minutes from being told ""search,"" the dog had found its victim.
Avalanche rescue dogs are asked to do things that would scare most dogs: fly in helicopters, ride on snowmobiles, walk through deep mountain snow at night with the sun’s reflection off the moon as the main source of light, and get on their handler’s shoulders so they can be skied down the mountain.
Mike Currid, another Subaru scholarship recipient, said his dog, Reagan, has been lowered from chairlifts 60 feet off the ground. The dogs wouldn’t be up for these tasks if they didn’t have faith in their handlers, and the handlers cherish that bond.
Dent, the handler with an Australian cattle dog, put her backpack on the snow to give Momo a perch to sit atop while also keeping her paws off the cold ground. Ripley, a Border Collie, hopped into Joe Baldwin's arms to bundle up in the cold mountain air. Charlie Stewart dug an alcove into the snow for Iggy that kept her protected from the wind and the commotion of skiers, snowmobiles and other dogs.
“She sleeps in my bed at night, we’re best friends,” said Dan Skilling of his dog Tela. “She trusts me so much. If I tell her to do something, she’s going to do it no matter what. And I know that she will always be there for me. The unconditional love and support I get from her means the world.”
And Christiansen said that extends to anybody unlucky to be caught in an avalanche.
“It truly is a bond between an animal and a man helping out another human being,"" he said.

"AP, AP","OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) Matt Duchene had two goals and an assist in his first game against his former club, and the Ottawa Senators beat the Colorado Avalanche 5-2 on Wednesday night.
Duchene had missed the previous three games due to the birth of his first son. He hadn't played against the Avalanche since being traded to Ottawa in November 2017.
Brady Tkachuk, Mark Stone and Ryan Dzingel also scored for the Senators, and Anders Nilsson made 30 saves. It was Ottawa's first win at home since Dec. 17.
Nikita Zadorov and Nathan MacKinnon scored for the Avalanche, who wrapped up a five-game trip. Semyon Varlamov stopped 26 shots.
Duchene put the Senators ahead 4-1 with his 19th goal of the season midway through the third period. Zack Smith had fired a puck that went wide of the net off the back boards, and Duchene picked it up and scored short side.
The Avalanche appeared to cut the lead in half minutes later, but it was waived off upon review because the left post was off the mooring.
MacKinnon had a power-play goal with four minutes remaining and Varlamov on the bench for the two-man advantage. The Avalanche had another opportunity after Christian Jaros sent the puck over the glass, but Colorado couldn't capitalize. Duchene scored into an empty net with 1:02 left.

"AP, AP","NEW YORK (AP) After rallying from two goals down early in the second period to take the lead in the third, the New York Islanders didn't get discouraged when Colorado tied the score late. They kept their focus and beat the struggling Avalanche in overtime.
Ryan Pulock scored his second goal of the game 2:23 into the extra period to lift New York to a 4-3 victory Saturday.
""We kind of dug ourselves a hole to start, getting down 2-0, but we stuck with it,"" Pulock said. ""Kind of an unfortunate bounce late for them to tie it, but we didn't go into a shell, we kept playing and we found a way to get it done.""
Jordan Eberle had a goal and an assist, Josh Bailey also scored and Brock Nelson had two assists for the Islanders. Robin Lehner stopped 25 shots as New York, which began the day two points ahead of Washington atop the Metropolitan Division, won for the eighth time in 11 games (8-1-2).
On the winner, Pulock fired a one-timer from the left faceoff circle off a pass from Casey Cizikas for his fifth of the season.
J.T. Compher had tied it 3-3 with 2:45 remaining when his shot deflected in off the skate of Islanders defenseman Devon Toews.
The Islanders took their first lead of the game a little more than three minutes earlier with their third straight goal.
Just 5 seconds after Soderberg and New York's Mathew Barzal were sent off for roughing, the Avalanche's Gabriel Landeskog was whistled for hooking to put the Islanders on a 4-on-3 power play. Pulock beat Varlamov just 23 seconds into the advantage on a slap shot from the left circle with 6:03 remaining for his first goal in 16 games.
""It's been a while since I scored, maybe at times gripping the stick a little too tight, but I was able to get a couple tonight. ... I think my last goal was an empty-netter, so before that it's been a while since I scored on a goalie, so it's a good feeling.""
Carl Soderberg had a goal and two assists, and Erik Johnson had a goal and an assist for Colorado, which matched a season high with its sixth straight loss (0-4-2). Semyon Varlamov finished with 37 saves in the Avalanche's 16th loss in 19 games (3-12-4).
Colorado's last two losses have both come in overtime, also losing 4-3 at Washington two days earlier.
""We kind of let this one slip away from us a little bit,"" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. ""It's disappointing to a certain extent that we were unable to get two points out of this one, but we played two really good teams in their buildings and found a way to get points in both of them.""
Tyson Barrie nearly won it for Colorado 15 seconds into overtime, but his shot went off the crossbar.
Bailey tied it 2-2 at 8:03 of the third, putting in the rebound of his own shot after Varlamov stopped the initial attempt. It was Bailey's 12th of the season and first since Jan. 18 against Washington.
Johnson pushed the Avalanche's lead to 2-0 at 2:36 of the second. With the teams skating 4-on-4 after a pair of penalties, he got a pass from Soderberg, skated into the offensive zone and cut to the right before firing it into the top left corner for his fifth.
""When you're winning, you find extra jump,"" Islanders captain Anders Lee said. ""The adversity down two goals it doesn't bother us.""
Eberle finally got the Islanders on the board with 1:47 left in the middle period. Varlamov stopped Lee's shot from between the circles but was unaware the puck trickled behind him, and Eberle skated in from the left side and knocked it in for his 13th.
Soderberg got Colorado on the scoreboard with 9:41 left in the opening period when he knocked in the rebound of Johnson's shot that bounced off the end boards right in front for his 18th.
NOTES: Colorado also went 0-4-2 from Dec. 21 to Jan. 2. ... Soderberg has eight goals and four assists in 15 games since Dec. 31. ... Johnson has two goals and two assists in his last three games. ... The Islanders swept the season series after winning the first meeting, 4-1 on Dec. 17 at Denver. ... Pulock now has six points in his last four games. ... Nelson has points in four straight games, totaling four assists and five points in the stretch. ... Lehner is 12-2-1 in his last 15 games.

CALGARY, Alberta (AP) Mark Giordano has been defying his age all season.
The 35-year-old defenseman had three more assists Wednesday night and the Calgary Flames kept right on rolling with a 5-3 victory over the Colorado Avalanche.
""Just trying to put pucks on net, jump in when I can,"" Giordano said. ""Playing on a pretty good power play with pretty good players, trying to move the puck around to those guys and get it in their hands and when you do that with those types of players, they reward you.""
Mikael Backlund, Mark Jankowski, Elias Lindholm and Michael Frolik scored for Calgary (28-13-4), which is 6-1-1 in its last eight games. Matthew Tkachuk added an empty-net goal for the Flames, who have a two-point lead over Vegas atop the Pacific Division.
Giordano had the primary assist on Lindholm's power-play goal that broke a 2-all tie at 12:57 of the second period and Frolik's deflection that made it 4-2 halfway through the third.
""He's one of the best I've ever met. I couldn't be happier that I have a chance to play with him,"" Frolik said. ""He's been unbelievable, especially this year. He's really driving the bus on the back end now.""
Johnny Gaudreau added two assists for the Flames to extend his point streak to six games.
Giordano has 303 career assists, moving him past Joe Nieuwendyk into fifth on the franchise list.
Nathan MacKinnon ran his point streak to eight games with a goal for Colorado (20-16-8). Erik Johnson and Mikko Rantanen also scored as the slumping Avalanche dropped to 1-6-2 in their last nine games.
""We're not finding ways to win right now, whether it's a save at a key time or a goal at a key time,"" said Gabriel Landeskog, who fired 12 shots on David Rittich the most by an NHL player in a game this season. ""We're generating plenty of chances and we allowed only 16 shots. When you do that you've got to be able to win.""
Rittich, sharp all night, made 32 saves to improve to 16-4-3.
""He was awesome, again,"" Giordano said. ""It's the timely saves that are huge, to be honest. When you're tied or you're up one and he's keeping that same score line. He's been doing it all year and again, another big night by him.""
Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov, tested only 15 times, fell to 11-9-5.
""We have to help them more,"" Rantanen said, defending Colorado's goaltending. ""It's been our problem lately. Not just the last two games, even before that. We score enough goals to win, but we can't give up seven or five goals every night.""
Colorado has been struggling to kill off penalties. Meanwhile, the Flames' penalty kill had a big night, going 4 for 4 against an Avalanche team that came into the game ranked fifth with the man advantage.
""Our PK, the role is to shut it down so I think we did a pretty good job of that and trying to halt their momentum,"" said Jankowski, who scored his seventh goal.
Frolik's goal at 9:14 of the third, when he deflected in Giordano's point shot, ended up the game-winner after Rantanen scored with 38 seconds remaining and the goalie pulled.
Calgary got off to a fast start when Backlund buried James Neal's rebound at 5:34. The Flames doubled their lead five minutes later on Jankowski's seventh.
But the Avalanche got back to even before the period ended.
Consecutive giveaways by Rittich and Monahan resulted in the Avs getting a tic-tac-toe goal from their top line with MacKinnon completing the passing sequence with Landeskog and Rantanen.
Johnson's shot just inside the post tied it with 19 seconds left in the period, but the Avalanche came up short again.
""A little bit disheartening, playing two games like that on the road back-to-back against two really good teams and coming out with nothing. Because I thought for the most part that we were really good tonight,"" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. ""It feels like defensively we have to play a perfect game right now because we just aren't getting any puck luck at the other end.""

"AP, AP","TORONTO (AP) Carl Soderberg had his first career hat trick and the Colorado Avalanche defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-3 on Monday night.
Gabriel Landeskog, Mikko Rantanen and Matt Calvert also scored for Colorado, which had lost nine of its last 10 games overall (1-7-2), and seven straight in regulation on the road.
Semyon Varlamov stopped 17 shots for the Avalanche.
Igor Ozhiganov, Kasperi Kapanen and Mitch Marner scored for Toronto. Frederik Andersen made 32 saves in his return to the starting lineup after missing eight games with a groin injury. Auston Matthews added two assists.
Toronto, which entered play two points up on the Boston Bruins for second in the Atlantic Division, has lost five of its last seven games and four of five at home.
Soderberg scored his second goal of the game with 8:15 left in the third period and added an empty net goal.
Soderberg broke a 3-3 tie midway through the third when he snapped his 14th goal of the season past Andersen off a pass from J.T. Compher after Colin Wilson won a battle behind Toronto's net.
Toronto, which went 4-4-0 without Andersen, pulled its goalie with just under three minutes to go, but Calvert beat Matthews to a loose puck in the Colorado zone and banked a shot off the boards for his seventh of the season with 2:51 left.
Soderberg completed the hat trick by scoring into an empty net at 18:12.
With some of the fans at Scotiabank Arena booing Leafs defenseman Jake Gardiner every time he touched the puck after a soft play led directly to Soderberg's short-handed score in the second period to make it 3-2 for the visitors, Marner tied the game six minutes into the third.
The winger took a pass from Travis Dermott and ripped his 18th goal of the season and third in as many games past Varlamov's glove.
After a scoreless first, the middle period featured five goals, and another that was disallowed.
Ozhiganov scored his third at 2:14 with a shot from the point through a screen fooled Varlamov.
Leafs winger Par Lindholm appeared to score at 3:32, but the goal was called back after Colorado challenged for offside.
Toronto went right back to work and scored 11 seconds after play resumed four seconds in game time before the puck entered the net on Lindholm's effort when Kapanen snapped a seven-game drought with his 15th.
Landeskog tipped home his 28th at 6:33 off a point shot from Tyson Barrie.
Andersen did well to stop MacKinnon on a partial breakaway and Wilson's quick backhand, but could do nothing when Rantanen stripped Nazem Kadri in the Toronto zone and scored his 21st at 9:56.
Soderberg then made it 3-2 on his 13th with 5:31 left in the second when he outmuscled Gardiner for the puck late in a Toronto power play before chipping a shot past Andersen's blocker.
With their No. 1 goalie back in the crease, the Leafs played their best lineup except for injured fourth-line winger Tyler Ennis (broken ankle) for just the fifth time this season.
After Andersen had to be sharp on a couple Colorado chances as Toronto barely touched the puck in the game's first two minutes, the Leafs had great looks on a power play.
NOTES: Andersen had originally targeted Saturday's home game against Boston, only to be cut down by a flu bug. ... Leafs backup Garret Sparks, meanwhile, was back on the bench following five games out with a concussion. ... Michael Hutchinson, who started the last five outings for Toronto on an emergency basis with both Andersen and Sparks sidelined, was loaned to the AHL Marlies. ... Colorado's top line of Rantanen, Landeskog and Nathan MacKinnon came in with 185 points on the season.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) All that Winnipeg firepower was on full display Tuesday night.
Blake Wheeler had a goal and three assists as the Jets scored on 33 percent of their shots in a 7-4 victory over the Colorado Avalanche.
Mathieu Perreault, Kyle Connor, Bryan Little, Andrew Copp, Mark Scheifele and Jacob Trouba also scored for Winnipeg, which converted three of four power-play opportunities. Trouba, Scheifele and Tyler Myers each had two assists.
""I think we like what we can do offensively,"" Wheeler said. ""So there's going to be nights where we pour it on and their goalie plays well. And there's going to be nights where we get a few and make the most of our chances.""
Gabriel Landeskog scored twice and set a career high with his 27th goal for Colorado. Carl Soderberg had a goal and an assist, and Ryan Graves also scored. Nathan MacKinnon and Tyson Barrie each contributed two assists.
Connor Hellebuyck made 37 saves for the Jets, who have won two straight and improved to 3-3 in their last six games.
""That was pretty fun,"" Scheifele said about the wide-open game. ""I'm sure the fans loved it. I'm good with it.""
Philipp Grubauer stopped 14 shots for Colorado, which ended a six-game skid with a 6-1 win over the Rangers on Friday.
The Jets scored three times on the power play and once short-handed to lead 4-3 after the second period. They led 4-1 early in the second, but the Avalanche scored twice late in the period.
""We always say we have good character, but (we don't) really care right now,"" Colorado forward Mikko Rantanen said. ""It's two points that we care about. It's nice to have a good character, but if you can't win, it's tough. So we just have to focus on winning.""
Copp scored at 3:59 of the third and Scheifele made it 6-3 after Wheeler intercepted a pass and sent the puck to him on a breakaway. Scheifele's shot hit Grubauer, the puck flew up and Scheifele swatted it into the net at 11:12 for his 23rd of the season.
Landeskog scored with just more than three minutes remaining.
Trouba scored into an empty net on the power play with 1:06 left.
""We have to stay positive, even if we've been losing a lot,"" Soderberg said. ""It's still a new game tomorrow and I think we played pretty good. Take that with us and battle even harder tomorrow.""
NOTES: MacKinnon extended his point streak to seven games (four goals, six assists). ... Barrie is on a five-game point streak, with one goal and seven assists.

"Associated Press, Associated Press","A woman with a national flag waits on the side of a highway in Caracas to see a caravan of buses organized by opposition leader and self-declared acting president Juan Guaido, pass by as it heads to the border with Colombia to bring in US-supplied humanitarian aid. 
 (Photo11: YURI CORTEZ, AFP/Getty Images)
CUCUTA, Colombia Venezuelas National Guard fired tear gas on residents clearing a barricaded border bridge to Colombia on Saturday, as the opposition began making good on its high-risk plan to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuela despite objections from President Nicolas Maduro.
By midday, opposition leader Juan Guaido pulled himself onto a semitruck and shook hands with its driver as he and Colombian President Ivan Duque gave a ceremonial send-off to an aid convoy looking to transport nearly 200 metric tons of mostly U.S.-supplied emergency food and medical supplies from the Colombian border city of Cucuta.
Our call to the armed forces couldnt be clearer: put yourself on the right side of history, he said in an appeal to troops who constitute Maduros last-remaining major plank of support in a country ravaged by hyperinflation and widespread shortages.
The opposition is calling on masses of Venezuelans to form a humanitarian avalanche to escort the trucks across several border bridges.
But clashes started at dawn in the Venezuelan border town of Urena, when residents began removing yellow metal barricades and barbed wire blocking the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge. Venezuelas National Guard responded forcefully, firing tear gas and buckshot on the protesters, some of them masked youth throwing rocks, who demanded that the aid pass through.
Later, the youth commandeered a city bus and set it afire. At least two dozen people were injured in the disturbances, according to local health officials in Urena.
The potentially volatile moment for both Venezuelas government and opposition comes exactly one month after Guaido, a 35-year-old lawmaker, declared himself interim president based on a controversial reading of the constitution before a sea of cheering supporters. While he has earned popular backing and recognition from over 50 nations, he has not sealed the support of the military, whose loyalty to Maduro is crucial.
Were tired. Theres no work, nothing, Andreina Montanez, 31, said as she sat on a curb recovering from the sting of tear gas used to disperse the crowd.
A single mom, she said she lost her job as a seamstress in December and had to console her 10-year-old daughters fears that she would be left orphaned when she decided to join Saturdays protest.
I told her I had to go out on the streets because theres no bread, she said. But still, these soldiers are scary. Its like theyre hunting us.
At the Simon Bolivar bridge, a group of aid volunteers in blue vests calmly walked up to a police line and shook officers hands, appealing for them to join their fight. But the goodwill lasted only a short while and a few hours later they were driven back with tear gas, triggering a chaotic stampede.
At the same post, four National Guardsmen deserted the force early in the day and took refuge inside Colombia.
A video provided by Colombian authorities shows three of the men wading through a crowd with their assault rifles and pistols held above their heads in a sign of surrender. The young soldiers were then ordered to lie facedown on the ground as migration officials urged angry onlookers to keep a safe distance.
Ive spent days thinking about this, said one of the soldiers, whose identity was not immediately known. He called on his comrades to join him: There is a lot of discontent inside the forces, but also lots of fear.
Last SlideNext Slide
Guaido, who has offered amnesty to soldiers who join the oppositions fight, applauded their bravery, saying it was a sign that support for Maduro was crumbling.
They arent deserters, he said on Twitter. Theyve decided to put themselves on the side of the people and the constitution..The arrival of liberty and democracy to Venezuela cant be detained.
International leaders including U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres are appealing for the sides to avoid violence.
But on Friday, a member of an indigenous tribe was killed and 22 others injured in clashes with security forces who enforced Maduros orders to keep the aid out at a crossing with Brazil.
In previous waves of unrest, citizens have been tear-gassed and killed.
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said the military would never have orders to fire on the civilian population and likened the aid push to a media spectacle.
We can only hope that sanity and good sense prevail in Cucuta, in Colombia, and that it will remain as a big show, a big party, and that they dont try to open the doors to a military intervention, he said Friday at U.N. headquarters in New York.
The push comes on the heels of a giant concert organized by British billionaire Richard Branson aimed at pressuring Maduro to accept the aid. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans gathered in a field to hear pop stars like Juanes sing beneath a scorching sun. Guaido made a surprise appearance toward the end.
The opposition is planning to hold three simultaneous aid pushes on Saturday. Aside from the events in Colombia, they also hope to get humanitarian assistance delivered by sea and through Venezuelas remote border with Brazil, which the government of Maduro has ordered closed.
Amid the sometimes chaotic and hard-to-verify flow of information, opposition lawmakers and Guaido said the first shipment of humanitarian aid had crossed into Venezuela from Brazil although reports from the ground revealed that two trucks carrying the aid had only inched up to the border itself.
Dueling demonstrations also took place in the capital. Government opponents, one of them dressed like Captain America in a nod to the Trump administrations prominent role cornering Maduro, headed toward an air base. With the opposition mostly mobilized along the border, a much larger mass of red-shirted government supporters, some of them on motorcycles, filed downtown toward the presidential palace.
Venezuelas military has served as the traditional arbiter of political disputes in the South American country, and in recent weeks, top leaders have pledged their unwavering loyalty to Maduro. However, many believe that lower-ranking troops who suffer from the same hardships as many other Venezuelans may be more inclined to now let the aid enter.
Opposition leaders are pushing forward in belief that whether Maduro lets the aid in or not, he will come out weakened. They also contend that if the military does allow the food and medical gear to pass, it will signify troops are now loyal to Guaido.
Analysts warn that there may be no clear victor and humanitarian groups have criticized the opposition as using the aid as a political weapon.
I dont know that anyone can give a timeline of when the dam might break, and its quite possible that it wont, said Eric Farnsworth of the Council of the Americas and Americas Society, a Washington-based think tank.
Fearful of what they might encounter, some Venezuelans in Cucuta said they planned to stay away from the border crossings, while others said theyd face the risks and go.
For my son, Id risk everything, said Oscar Herrera, 25, a Venezuelan man who took an 18-hour bus ride to Colombia to buy his infant medicine for a skin irritation earlier this week.
Hernan Parcia, 32, a father of three, said he planned to go with his entire family.
Im pained by whats happening to my country, he said. They can count on me.

CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland A 34-year-old Frenchman whose job was to check the safety of ski slopes died overnight after being injured in an avalanche at a popular Swiss Alps ski resort, police said Wednesday.
The man was one of four injured people who were rescued after being swept away Tuesday afternoon by an avalanche that hit a slope on Plaine Morte, a glacier near the town of Crans-Montana.
Unfortunately, overnight one of the four injured people died, said Steve Leger, a spokesman for the Valais canton police department.
Leger said 43 people reached out, worried that their friends or family had been hit by the avalanche, but we systematically verified found, located these people and rule them out of danger.

Nearly 250 rescue workers, medics, police officers and military personnel took part in the search, backed by eight helicopters and a dozen search dogs. They searched all night but stopped Wednesday morning.
The cause for the avalanche wasnt immediately clear. Roughly half of the 840-meter (920-yard) long avalanche made a direct hit across the ski slope. Leger said one possibility was that it could have been triggered by the passage of a skier.
Switzerlands Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research had put the risk of an avalanche in the area at level 2, which is relatively low on its 5-point scale.
The avalanche comes ahead of a weekend womens World Cup event involving top skiers such as Switzerlands Lara Gut on the Mont Lachaux run at Crans-Montana.
Authorities said the avalanche was not expected to affect the event, which begins with training runs on Thursday.

"AP, AP","DENVER (AP) The playoff-chasing Colorado Avalanche will be without captain Gabriel Landeskog for four-to-six weeks with an upper-body injury.
Avalanche coach Jared Bednar announced the news Friday after practice. He called missing Landeskog a ""huge loss.""
The All-Star forward was hurt in the third period Thursday at Dallas when he collided with Stars goaltender Ben Bishop.
Landeskog has a career-best 33 goals this season, including an NHL-leading 19 in the third period.
The 26-year-old Landeskog was the second overall pick by Colorado in 2011. He has 410 career points, becoming the second player in his draft class to reach the 400-point milestone.
Colorado is currently on the outside of the playoff picture with 14 games remaining. The team hosts Buffalo on Saturday.

Nathan Grayson,"Despite an avalanche of over-the-line jokes and gaffes that cost him deals and a show, as well as an ever-changing YouTube landscape, Felix Pewdiepie Kjellberg remains the king of YouTube mountain. For now, anyway: An Indian music production company called T-Series has been fast on his heels for a while andwith their subscriber counts at a near-tiecould topple him any day now. One fan decided to take matters into his own hands by hacking printers. YouTube currently displays both Pewdiepie and T-Series as having 72 million subscribers, but in reality Pewdiepie is about 100,000 subscribers ahead. T-Series, however, has been making faster gains, leading fans to start advertising on Pewdiepies part. Some have done (relatively) normal things like playing Pewdiepies song Bitch Lasagna at a club. Others have purchased billboards in their cities, because its their money and they can do what they want with it, I guess. And while these fans are mostly having a laugh by *checks paper* throwing money and publicity at one of the worlds wealthiest, most popular YouTubers, theres a method to the madness: People want the face of YouTube to remain an individual creator rather than a big company. (Granted, Pewdiepie is practically an enterprise himself at this point, but you get the idea.) Recently, people in places ranging from Canada to the UK reported that their printers began mysteriously spitting out Pewdiepie ads. PewDiePie, the currently most subscribed to channel on YouTube, is at stake of losing his position as the number one position by an Indian company called T-Series that simply uploads videos of Bollywood trailers and campaigns, the ad read, telling people to unsubscribe from T-Series, subscribe to Pewdiepie, and Tell everyone you know. Seriously. On Twitter, a user named TheHackerGiraffe took credit for the ads, saying that people should spread the word with your friends about printers and printer security because this is actually a scary matter. Speaking with The Verge, he said that it was actually pretty easy to browse a repository of internet-connected devices and hack 50,000 of them: The most horrifying part is: I never considered hacking printers before, the whole learning, downloading, and scripting process took no more than 30 minutes. Despite all that, the new Pewdiepie video did not mention TheHackerGiraffe. I guess global-scale cyber crime in the name of helping a Swedish millionaire stave off a multi-million dollar Indian music production company doesnt pay after all.","Despite an avalanche of over-the-line jokes and gaffes that cost him deals and a show, as well as an ever-changing YouTube landscape, Felix “Pewdiepie” Kjellberg remains the king of YouTube mountain.

KATHRYN SHATTUCK,"This film makes a strong statement about extreme nationalism, something both Europe and the United States are grappling with. I’ve noticed the uprise for some time now, being in France for the past two elections with Marine Le Pen every time in the first round. And I’m incredibly ashamed that for the first time since World War II, the right nationalists have a seat in the government in Germany. And then look what happens here. It definitely concerns me, especially since my generation is the true European generation. I started my life as an adult with doors opening and opportunities rising. And now doors are closing again. Why a German film after all these years? I had been hoping and waiting for a part from Germany for a long time. But I don’t really know anyone in the German film industry. And I think there was always a little bit of resentment that I made my career elsewhere. The French kind of claimed me — being “Franco-Allemande” when I was in a good movie, though in a bad movie I’m German. [Laughs] And I made American films. Nobody knew where to place me. Will your best actress win at Cannes translate into greater power? You have been outspoken about the inequities in the film industry. We’ll see. I think if you do the same work then you should be considered an equal, whatever that means. It can be money-wise but also the way your name appears. It’s weird in Hollywood that the male always gets cast first and he has approval over his female co-star. I don’t think that’s right. Also, the studios love to pick a young actor they don’t have to pay a lot of money, put them in these $120 million movies, and if the movie works, you’re all of a sudden Hollywood’s golden girl. If the movie is a miss, you fall into obscurity. Actors need time to fail, to grow, to get better. Very few people are as good at 20 as they will be at 40 or 50. Male actors still get that opportunity. You appeared in Quentin Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds,” a Weinstein movie. Did the sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein surprise you? That was shocking to me. But everybody knew what he was like. Everybody did. Have the barrage of sexual harassment allegations about other people surprised you? Actually, it’s awesome. It feels like an avalanche. But I believe that things are going to change because now we’ve created space for everybody to feel like they can say something. I think there’s a defining moment, not just in Hollywood but in our conscious being as humans — and women especially. Women are looking to make content that women want to see. Women are really taking control of their destiny, and it’s exciting to be a part of it.

"AP, AP","San Jose Sharks right wing Kevin Labanc, front, struggles to control the puck as Colorado Avalanche defensemen Anton Lindholm, center, of Sweden, and Tyson Barrie pursue during the third period of an NHL hockey game Tuesday, Feb. 6, 2018, in Denver. The Avalanche won 3-1. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press) DENVER (AP) — Gabriel Bourque and Tyson Jost scored 2:14 apart in the second period, Jonathan Bernier stopped 39 shots and the Colorado Avalanche beat the San Jose Sharks 3-1 on Tuesday night. Colorado returned from a six-game road trip and won its ninth straight at the Pepsi Center, the club's longest home winning streak since moving to Denver in 1995. The Avalanche are 19-7-1 at home this season. Colorado struggled to generate many scoring chances without Nathan MacKinnon (left shoulder) and Mikko Rantanen (lower body), the team's top two scorers. In their absence, the Avalanche were outshot 39-20. The Sharks pulled goalie Martin Jones in the final minute and had a flurry of chances to tie it, but J.T. Compher iced the game with an empty-net goal with three seconds remaining. Jones stopped 17 shots for the Sharks, who have won just twice in their last seven games. Joel Ward scored his first goal since Nov. 22. San Jose had 16 of the first 20 shots but found itself down 2-0 early in the second. Bourque opened the scoring 2:31 into the period after the Sharks turned the puck over in their own zone. Jost took control and pushed it ahead to Compher, who slid an expert pass along the crease to Bourque for his third goal of the season. The Avalanche added to it as they connected on two long passes to set up Jost. The 19-year-old split two defenders just in front of the blue line and beat Jones' glove for his fourth of the season. Ward cut the deficit to 2-1 with 6:31 left in the period after scoring on a rebound. The goal was originally waved off, but video replay showed the puck snuck just inside. The Sharks outshot the Avalanche 26-10 through two periods. NOTES: C Joe Thornton missed his sixth straight game and is expected to be out several weeks for San Jose.. Jost and Compher each had a goal and an assist.. MacKinnon is expected be out two to four weeks, while Rantanen missed his first game of the season..

Chris Reed,"From AVALANCHE to the Half-Life 2 Resistance, here are some of the most notable rebels in gaming. By Chris Reed The Man got you down? Are you and your fellow citizens being trampled by the jackboots of tyrants? If so, it’s time for a rebellion. Rebelling against the forces of evil is a common setup in video games. To celebrate the selfless heroes who take up arms against their oppressors, let’s look at some of the most iconic rebellions in gaming history. In Final Fantasy 7, it’s not just humanity in danger — it’s the entire planet. Barret knows it. Tifa knows it. And after a quick education from these AVALANCHE rebels, Cloud knows it too. The threat comes from the Shinra Electric Power Company, an evil corporation that’s sucking up all the Mako energy it can get its greedy paws on. Unfortunately for AVALANCHE (and all other life on the planet), Mako energy is connected to the Lifestream. And without the Lifestream, everything dies. So if the bad guys slurp up too much Mako, the planet becomes unlivable. That’s bad news for anyone without a rocket ship. So the AVALANCHE heroes employ some creative (and destructive) tactics to take down Shinra and save everyone and everything. Not bad for a group of so-called “eco-terrorists.” In Half-Life, aliens do not come in peace. After scientists open a rift to a distant planet, a group of extraterrestrials known as the Combine come marching through. Unfortunately for us, the Combine are an inter-dimensional militant group hellbent on conquering the Multiverse. They take over our lovely planet in a matter of hours. Flash forward a few years, and humanity lives in a Combine-run police state. Things are looking pretty bleak at this point. Enter the Resistance. Led by Dr. Eli Vance, this group of rebels uses science to fight back. With tools like a gravity gun and a giant robot “Dog,” the Resistance begins orchestrating the Combine’s overthrow.

 Aid has been unloaded from US planes in Colombia and driven towards the Venezuela border
Venezuela's self-declared interim leader has set up a confrontation over US aid by calling for Venezuelans to cross borders and bring it into the country next week.
Juan Guaidó wants a ""humanitarian avalanche"" and ""caravans"" to go to the borders to get the aid next Saturday.
President Nicolás Maduro says the aid is part of a US plot to disguise an invasion into Venezuela.
The US says Mr Guaidó requested aid because the country was in crisis.
USAID administrator Mark Green said children were going hungry, that nearly every hospital in Venezuela was experiencing medicine shortages and that three million people had left the country.
It remains unclear if the aid will be allowed to enter Venezuela. 
US military planes have already delivered aid to the Colombian border town of Cucuta. Mr Guaidó said more aid distribution centres would be opened in the Brazilian border town of Roraima and in the Caribbean.
What is Guaidó planning?
Outlining his plans for 23 February, Mr Guaidó, who is leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, urged Venezuelans to mobilise en masse in all of the country's states.
He said aid would enter Venezuela by land and sea and also urged Venezuelans living abroad to demonstrate and for those in Colombia and Brazil to accompany the aid into Venezuela.
Media captionVenezuela's President Maduro to BBC: US aid trucks are a charade
In an earlier tweet he said 600,000 people had signed up as volunteers to help bring in the aid and appealed to the military - which has so far remained loyal to Mr Maduro - to ""put itself on the side of the people"" and let the aid in.
Mr Guaidó has also said that more aid will be flown to the Dutch territory of Curaçao early next week. The opposition says that if it gets in Venezuela it will be first distributed to infants and pregnant mothers living in extreme poverty.
What does Maduro say?
He has denied there is any crisis in Venezuela and has called the operation a US-orchestrated show.
On Friday he ordered the military to remain on high alert against what he described as US ""war plans"". 
His Vice-President Delcy Rodriguez meanwhile alleged that the US aid was contaminated with carcinogens ""to poison our population"" and described it as a ""biological weapon"", Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported. 
One road bridge between Venezuela and Colombia remains blocked on the Venezuelan side by shipping containers.
Media captionWhy Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa
What has led to this?
Mr Maduro, who has been in power since 2013, was re-elected to a second term last year. But the elections were controversial, with many opposition candidates barred from running or jailed. There were also allegations of vote-rigging.
The head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Mr Guaidó declared himself president on 23 January. He said the constitution allowed him to assume power temporarily when the president was deemed illegitimate.
The US, some Latin American countries and some European countries, including the UK, support his claim. Russia, China, Mexico, Turkey and others say Mr Maduro is the legitimate president.

James Tanner,"Toronto Maple Leafs forwards Kasperi Kapanen and Andreas Johnsson Are Un-touchable.
Because the Toronto Maple Leafs still have to sign Mitch Marner, in addition to dealing with the pending RFA status of both Kapanen and Johnsson, they two breakout Leafs wingers have become fodder for trade talk.
The idea is that you should take from where the Leafs are strong (supposedly the wing) and upgrade the blue line.
I don’t think this is the case.  Both players should remain with the Leafs and not be traded under any circumstances.
Kapanen and Johnsson
First, let’s kill the offer sheet idea.  Neither of these players is going to get four million dollars annually based on less than one full season as top six NHL players.  Technically, Johnsson isn’t even a top six forward (he’s as good as one, and should be a top six forward, but the Leafs play him on the third and fourth line).
Zero percent chance either is offersheeted.  There are no offer sheets in the NHL, and no one is dusting off the rules for one in order to try and get a late bloomer whose putting up stats on an offensive juggernaut.
Which brings me to my second point: the cap is going up, it’s a no brainer to sacrifice Hainsey, Brown, Hyman and Zaitsev in order to lock Kapanen and Johnsson up.  They will both re-sign, and if either player gets more than $3 million then they probably also signed for four years.  I predict that you will see both of these guys taking one-year deals for about $2.5.  That’s my guess, anyways.
Now what about the Leafs strength at the wings?  They have Marner, Nylander, Johnsson, Kapannen and……that’s about it.
Hyman scores like a fourth liner, although he’s good enough to be a top nine winger.  Marleau and Brown are fourth liners at the absolute best.  Ennis and Moore are good, but not good enough to brag about your “depth” if you continually overplay two fourth liners and a third liner too high in the lineup, which the Leafs do.
Depth?
Realistically, any team that plays Zach Hyman on its first line can’t brag about their depth at the wings.  If utilized properly, Marner, Nylander, Johnsson and Kapanen provide top-flight NHL wingers to what can potentially be a great team.
But I don’t really care for their depth beyond that, especially with a coach who vastly overrates what Marleau, Hyman or Brown can contribute.
No team entering the playoffs should be willing to trade one of their top four wingers, especially if their defense isn’t horrible.  I think the Leafs, with Muzzin, Rielly, Gardiner and Dermott are doing just fine.
I would like them to add a right-handed shot to replace Ron Hainsey, but if the cost of Radko Gudas is Andreas Johnsson, then the Flyers can kick stones.
Realistically, Johnsson and Kapanen should both be available to outperform whatever they sign in the summer to play for next season.  You don’t move cheap young forwards, especially ones this good.
A first rounder isn’t going to be replacing either player, so I say, if pressed, the Toronto Maple Leafs should be looking at trading any prospect or draft pick in the organization before they move Radko Gudas.
Kapanen and Johnsson are basically untouchable.
Kapanen and Johnsson are both capable scorers. I think Johnsson might be the better overall player, but Kapanen’s speed is incredible.  They’re both good.
I think when a team can pair four wingers on the  level of Nylander, Marner, Kapanen and Johnsson – with three centres on the level of Matthews, Tavares and Kadri, even if it does only turn out to be for a short period of time, they’ve got to try and run with it.
The Leafs have four really good defenseman.  It is necessary to replace at least one of Zaitsev or Hainsey, but not at the cost of Johnsson or Kapanen.  Who knows, an internal option like Rasmus Sandin or TImothy Liljegren might even be an upgrade, especially in light of the fact that Mike Babcock doesn’t seem willing to re-think the minutes that Zaitsev and Hainsey get, so ditching one and promoting a rookie would then force Babcock to play Muzzin and Dermott more.
And who knows – maybe in a sheltered role Liljegren or Sandin will shine.
Either way, I can’t stress this enough: trading Kasperi Kapanen or Andreas Johnsson would be a mistake.

Kendra Mangione,"Don't put away your shovel just yet.
Yet another snowstorm is expected to dump as much as 10 centimetres on parts of B.C.'s South Coast Friday morning, Environment Canada says.
In a warning issued Thursday morning, the weather agency forecast another blast of winter weather for Metro Vancouver, the Fraser Valley and the Sunshine Coast.
Areas affected by the incoming frontal system are expected to see snowfall early Friday morning, which could be mixed with rain.
The snow is expected to intensify at some point during the morning, then will taper off in the afternoon, Environment Canada said. By the end, the agency expects municipalities under the warning to see five to 10 centimetres.
It warns the snow may fall heavily, accumulating quickly and making travel challenging.
In Metro Vancouver, the warning applies to:
Burnaby
New Westminster
Coquitlam
Maple Ridge
Richmond
Delta
the North Shore
Surrey
Langley
The Fraser Valley warning includes Hope, Abbotsford and Chilliwack.
The Sunshine Coast warning applies to the area between Gibsons and Earls Cove, and Saltery Bay to Powell River. 
Other snowfall warnings are in effect elsewhere in the province.
Ten centimetres of snow are expected overnight in northern B.C., while the Cassiar Mountains area could see as many as 20 centimetres of snow.
Warnings were also issued Thursday for Atlin, inland sections of the Central Coast, Haines Road, South Klondike Highway, Teslin, Watson Lake and Williston. The latest updates are available from Environment Canada.","Weather warning: 5-10 cm of snow could fall over parts of Metro Vancouver CTV News Snowfall warning issued for Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley, Sunshine Coast for Friday Global News Snowfall and avalanche warnings issued for B.C.'s South Coast Vancouver Sun En…",2019-02-21T19:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ctvnews.ca'}",Weather warning: 5-10 cm of snow could fall over parts of Metro Vancouver - CTV News,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/weather-warning-5-10-cm-of-snow-could-fall-over-parts-of-metro-vancouver-1.4306978,https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4306994.1550778196!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,,Ctvnews.ca,avalanche,1
Joe Ciolli,"The benchmark S&amp;P 500 climbed more than 12% in the first quarter of 2019. And if you haven't paid attention to the crosscurrents brewing under the market's surface, you might conclude that the future for stocks is bright. 
 But a closer examination suggests the situation is exceedingly more dire than many might realize. 
 Yes, the market largely shrugged off the yield-curve inversion that sparked panic the prior week and finished March in strong fashion. That can be at least partially attributed to investor optimism around the Federal Reserve's newly dovish monetary policy, as well as the prospect of a successful trade-war resolution also played a large role. 
 However, there are still many folks on Wall Street that don't think those developments will be enough to support the equity market in the long term. Peter Cecchini, the global chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, falls firmly into that camp. 
 ""The risk-reward to owning US equities continues to remain unfavorable,"" he wrote in a recent client note. ""We still do not believe the Fed's communication was dovish enough to offset its implicit bearishness on economic fundamentals."" 
Read more: The Wall Street expert who called the last stock meltdown explains how investors could be falling into a catastrophic trap
 Cecchini also said recently that his firm is currently looking to sell the S&amp;P 500 any time it rises above the 2,800 level — a threshold it's flirted with over the past several weeks. That approach matches his year-end forecast of 2,390, which is roughly 15% below current levels. 
 But don't take Cecchini's word for it. All across the equity landscape, signals are flashing that the market's footing may not be as firm as it seems upon first glance. 
 Here's a breakdown of four major red flags being thrown up by stocks at present time. When viewed in tandem, it overwhelmingly suggests that the equity market's ongoing rally is scarily low-conviction. 
 1) Massive equity outflows so far in 2019 
 Perhaps the most directly damning statistic supporting the idea that the current stock rally is vulnerable is the amount of money that's been yanked from equity funds so far this year. 
 As the table below (from Bank of America Merrill Lynch) shows, investors have pulled a whopping $79 billion from stocks worldwide in 2019. 
 So where is that money going? Probably into bonds, considering BAML data shows a huge $86 billion year-to-date inflow for fixed-income securities. Those two figures, when viewed in tandem, don't paint the brightest picture for the future of stocks. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
2) Short interest on an S&amp;P 500-linked ETF has spiked 
 Short interest — or a measure of bets that a security will fall — has spiked in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF, which is designed to track the US equity benchmark. 
 The measure reached 6.7% of shares outstanding earlier this month, the highest since at least 2016, according to data compiled by IHS Markit. This suggests a groundswell of uncertainty, if not outright underlying bearishness, on domestic stocks. 
Joe Ciolli / Business Insider, data from IHS Markit 
3) The cost to hedge the S&amp;P 500 ETF has soared 
 The chart below shows the premium options traders are paying to protect against a 10% decline in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF over the next two months, relative to bets on a 10% increase. As you can see, it's the highest since October 2018 — yet another sign of investor trepidation. 
Joe Ciolli / Business Insider, data from Bloomberg 
4) Bets on a VIX increase have swelled 
 The fourth indicator of investor concern deals with the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX. As you can see in the red highlighted portion of the chart below, wagers that the VIX would increase spiked during a five-day period ended May 25. 
 Since long bets on the VIX serve as downside hedges on the S&amp;P 500, this sudden increase suggests the fraying of investor nerves — and their appetite for safety.

The Associated Press,"Three German skiers have been killed in an avalanche in Austria and a fourth is missing, police said Sunday as snowfall set in again in the northern Alps.
The bodies of the men, aged 57, 36 and 32, were recovered Saturday evening near the ski resort of Lech, a few hours after the wife of one of the skiers reported them missing. Police in Vorarlberg, Austria's westernmost province, said they had to call off the search for another missing German skier in the group, age 28, because of heavy snow and the risk of avalanches.
The avalanche brings to at least 24 the number of weather-related deaths reported in parts of Europe this month.
Police said the four friends had apparently skied onto a trail that was closed. Although they had avalanche protection equipment and deployed airbags, the victims were buried by the avalanche and suffered multiple injuries. They were located with the help of cellphone tracking.
On Saturday, authorities in southern Germany and Austria used a break in the weather to clear heavy loads of snow from roofs and roads.
But snow set in again on Saturday night. In the Bavarian town of Kempten, local authorities closed 11 sports halls as a precaution through Tuesday because the weight of snow on their roofs was expected to increase, the German news agency dpa reported.
Trains on part of the route between the German cities of Munich and Lindau, on Lake Constance near the Austrian border, were traveling more slowly than usual because of a risk of that trees weighed down by snow could fall onto the tracks.
Balderschwang, a small Alpine resort on Germany's border with Austria, was cut off on Sunday as the pass leading into it was closed for fear of avalanches.
In central Switzerland, trains carrying cars through the Furka tunnel were suspended because of an avalanche on a nearby road.","Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Luke Winkie,"Playing Rage 2 gave me flashbacks to playing Doom (2016). And that’s a very good thing. Remember when we were lukewarm about Doom? Remember when that project was stuck in endless development hell, and the franchise’s unimpeachable heritage was left to ride on the increasingly sour taste that Doom 3 had left in our mouths? Remember that dispiriting multiplayer beta, and Bethesda’s refusal to send out review copies, and those morbid quotes from Tim Willits ? Remember how that game still managed to blow the roof off the place, wrapping us all in a giddiness that seemed absolutely impossible a few years back? I’m trying to stay grounded, but if I’m being honest, I got a glimmer of that same miraculous feeling from playing a demo of Rage 2 at E3 this week. Rage isn’t even the most audacious reclamation project Bethesda has enacted this decade. That honor goes to Prey. Still, announcing a sequel to Rage in 2018 was pretty confounding. I’m not even sure that Rage has the cultural cachet to call itself the red-headed step child of the Id family. It’s more like a distant second cousin that periodically reminds you of its existence by its permanent presence in Steam seasonal sales. Why resurrect such a nonexistent legacy when you could break ground on a new IP? Or make a new Quake? Or do something more colorfully audacious, like a gritty Commando Keen reboot ? The answer, as I found out in the 15 minute demo I played, is simple: You make Rage 2, because you can make Rage 2 feel like Doom. Rage 2 isn’t exclusively an Id project. The company is working on the game in conjunction with Avalanche, which is beautifully serendipitous when you consider that Avalanche put out a reasonably successful Mad Max game a few years ago. The PR liaison at my demo described Rage 2's design as a mashup of Avalanche’s exploration sensibilities and Id’s FPS tuning, and at least the second half of that proved to be true from the moment I entered the tutorial. The liquid-fast circle strafing, the big, broad-shouldered weight of the firearms, the heavy, heavy industrial soundtrack—all of that was in place, and all of it felt just as wonderful as before. I’ll give you an example: The level I played took place in an abandoned government space base in the middle of a crusty desert ridge, rife with mohawked jamokes raiding the wreckage. I whipped out my assault rifle and started firing, which filled up a God of War -style combo tally in the corner of my screen. Eventually, I was instructed to launch into something called “Overdrive.” Functionally, this was a standard “enrage” meter that increased my damage while also regenerating my health. But it’s the aesthetics that make it stand out: Overdrive sends a purple wave of synthetic energy over your screen, makes your bullets physically larger, and ratchets up the gore to esoteric levels of excess. After the demo I talked to a developer who told me that you can also air juggle dudes with your gunshots in overdrive, and if that’s true: Jesus. It’s the Doomguy button. It’s also responsible for the single most satisfying sequence I’ve had with a shooter this year. Every creative decision I noticed in Rage 2 felt like it was extrapolated out of the Doom wheelhouse. Your character is outfitted with a series of “Nanotrite” abilities, which have something to do with nanomachines and explain the superhuman action in the fiction. The quick-dash mapped to the left bumper lets you flank and counterflank with ease. There’s a seismic, jumping ground-pound thing called Slam which flattens entire squadrons at once. And there’s a quick melee bash called Shatter that sends goons in your way flying backwards. I imagine that Rage 2 will allow you to do a fair amount of customization with the Nanotrite outfit you bring into battle—at least, it seemed that way, given the empty spaces left on the HUD. As far as the conventional arsenal goes, I had access to that assault rifle, a ridiculously loud shotgun, and these outstandingly ghastly shurikens that helicoptered through the air before embedding themselves in an unlucky thug’s skull. All of it was presented in a deliriously cyberpunk flavor of the usual Dune -ified post-apocalypse: neon tattoos, graffiti, spiked leather jackets. If the biggest complaint about the first Rage was its lack of style, Rage 2 is making up for lost time. But here’s the thing. This is only one half of Rage 2— the Id half. There is an entire car-combat open-world exploration system—the Avalanche half of Rage 2— waiting under the surface that I didn’t get a chance to touch. I left the demo praying that the studio manages to refine the ideas they presented in Mad Max into something less janky. Hopefully, Avalanche will come out the other end with a substantial narrative crunch and an interesting mission structure that will give the standout shooting mechanics a nice home. If they can walk that tightrope, Bethesda might have something really, really special on its hands, and this mercurial, tertiary franchise might reinvent itself as a classic.

Game No. 82 for these two boiled down to a winner-take-all scenario. Although, there was one caveat — the Avalanche couldn't allow the game to go to overtime since the Blues held the tiebreaker. St. Louis pulled out all the stops late in the third: Taking out goalie Jake Allen with around 4:35 remaining. Landeskog and Nieto sealed the win with empty-net tallies. THE BIGGEST GAME. THE BIGGEST CELLY. #BeatTheBlues #GoAvsGo pic.twitter.com/ZTIMb7T6WU — Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) April 8, 2018 Colorado finished with 95 points to become first NHL team to post a 40-point gain over an 82-game season since the Pittsburgh Penguins jumped 47 from 2005-06 (58) to 2006-07 (105). Jaden Schwartz had a power-play goal and Brayden Schenn scored with 38.4 seconds remaining for the Blues, who saw their playoff appearance streak halted at six straight seasons. Leading 2-1 late in the third, MacKinnon beat Allen with a shot over the goaltender's shoulder. MacKinnon had been held without a goal since March 18 when he had two against Detroit. He finished with 97 points — the most by an Avalanche player since Joe Sakic had 100 in 2006-07. Barrie gave Colorado a 2-0 lead in the second on a goal from the blue line that led to a challenge by St. Louis, which felt the puck left the zone. The officials took a long look before ruling it a good goal and determined ""there were no definitive replays which showed that the puck left the attacking zone,"" according to NHL situation room. Soon after, Schwartz answered when he tipped in a shot on a power play. The Blues arrived in town late following a 4-1 win in Chicago on Friday night. They sent Allen to the Mile High City early so he would be better rested for the big game. Allen made one diving save after another to keep things close. Girard scored his first goal since Feb. 22 on a slap shot through traffic with 46 seconds left in the first period to give the Avs a 1-0 advantage. St. Louis was dealt a blow midway through the first period when leading goal-scorer Vladimir Tarasenko left with an upper-body injury. He didn't return. The game definitely had a Game 7 feel. It made sleeping the night before a bit restless, Barrie said. The last time two teams met in their final game of the season while contending for the last available playoff spot in the conference was 2010. In that contest, Philadelphia beat the New York Rangers in a shootout.

"AP, AP","DENVER (AP) Peter Laviolette and his goaltender had a lot in common both were skillful in the art of deflecting.
In Laviolette's case, it was too much of the credit after earning victory No. 600 as an NHL coach.
""Tonight was a team win,"" the Predators coach said.
On a milestone Monday for Laviolette, goaltender Pekka Rinne stopped a penalty shot in making 35 saves and Nashville knocked off the reeling Colorado Avalanche 4-1.
Laviolette became the 20th coach in NHL history to reach the 600-win milestone and the third this season as he joined John Tortorella and Claude Julien. Laviolette also had stints with the New York Islanders, Carolina Hurricanes and the Philadelphia Flyers before stepping in with the Predators in 2014-15.
He gave plenty of kudos to his players for the achievement.
""Coming off a couple losses and playing Colorado, a team behind us in the standings, an important win for our guys,"" Laviolette said. ""I'm just thankful for not only this team but teams previous. It's been an accumulation of four different teams.
""Fortunate to be in the game and stay in the game greatest job in the world.""
Nick Bonino and Viktor Arvidsson scored 1:34 apart in the second period, while Roman Josi added another and Ryan Ellis contributed a late empty-netter from deep in his zone. The Predators maintained their mastery of the Avalanche, beating their Central Division rivals for a 12th time over the last 13 regular-season meetings.
Rinne was at a loss to explain the success.
""We seem to match up pretty good against them. At the same time, I have a ton of respect toward that team,"" Rinne said. ""It's a very good hockey team.""
Alexander Kerfoot had the lone goal for an Avalanche squad that's dropped five of seven.
Colorado was coming off a 7-1 win over Los Angeles on Saturday in which the team tied a franchise record with six goals in the second period. The scoring spree didn't carry over. The Avs haven't won two straight games since late November.
""I have no problem with the way we played today,"" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. ""We made a couple mistakes, they capitalized. They made lots of mistakes too, we didn't capitalize. To me the difference was Rinne.""
Rinne's biggest save came on a penalty shot by Matt Nieto in the second period to keep the game scoreless. Bonino soon followed by lining a shot between the pads of Semyon Varlamov. The Predators are 23-2-1 when scoring first.
""I tried,"" Nieto said of his penalty shot that was thwarted by Rinne's right pad. ""It didn't work out.""
Bonino breathed a sigh of relief. On the play, he tried to lift the stick of Nieto, which got Nieto on the hands and led to the penalty shot.
""(Rinne) was ready cool, calm, collected and made a good save,"" Bonino said.
Moments later, Bonino scored his 100th NHL goal. Arvidsson then increased the lead with his 11th goal in 14 games since returning from a broken thumb.
Kerfoot made it 2-1 with a tip-in at 16:43 of the second period, but Josi quickly restored the two-goal cushion by lifting a shot over Varlamov following a pinpoint pass from Austin Watson.
The first period was filled with plenty of pushing and a few punches. Things got a little heated when Watson took offense to Avalanche defenseman Nikita Zadorov delivering a big hit on a teammate. Watson challenged Zadorov to drop the gloves, and they squared off before being separated and sent to the penalty box.
Nieto agitated the Predators later in the period when he stopped in front of Rinne, sending a spray of ice into the goaltender's face.
Avalanche All-Star forward Mikko Rantanen returned after sitting out the third period against the Kings with a lower-body injury. He said at practice Sunday that ""everything is fine.""
Their recent play is another matter.
""There are some positive things,"" Rantanen said. ""But it was tough to find the back of the net.""
NOTES: Predators C Ryan Johansen served the second of a two-game suspension for a high stick on Winnipeg's Mark Scheifele. ... Avalanche D Erik Johnson (head) was in the concussion protocol and missed the game.

"AP, AP","DALLAS (AP) Philipp Grubauer made a season-high 44 saves, including 23 in the third period, defensemen Erik Johnson and Tyson Barrie scored goals and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Dallas Stars 3-1 on Thursday night to make the Western Conference playoff race even tighter.
Grubauer has allowed only two goals while facing 104 shots and carrying Colorado on a three-game winning streak.
Carl Soderberg added an empty-net goal with 49 seconds left for the final margin, helping the Avalanche leapfrog idle Minnesota for eighth place in the conference standings. Colorado took a deep tiebreaker lead over Arizona, which lost Thursday, for the second wild card. Colorado and Arizona have 78 points each, and the Avalanche currently would advance based on a better goal differential. The Coyotes will play at Colorado on March 29.
Tyler Seguin scored the lone goal for Dallas with 5:01 to play. Goalie Ben Bishop's personal winning streak ended at six games.
Dallas retained the first wild card by a four-point margin, but fell four points behind third-place St. Louis, a winning team on Thursday, in the Central Division.
The Stars killed the only power plays in a scoreless first period.
On the first power play five minutes in, the Avalanche had only one shot on goal. Shortly afterward, Bishop stopped two in-close attempts by Tyson Jost. Less than a minute later, Bishop foiled a breakaway by Nathan MacKinnon by saving a wrist shot and MacKinnon's rebound attempt.
Colorado outshot the Stars 13-9 in the first.
Momentum shifted in Dallas' direction in the second period - until the Avalanche scored at 17:20. Samuel Girard sent a pass to Johnson high in the left faceoff circle. Johnson one-timed a slap shot inside the left goalpost.
After two periods, the shots were even at 21.
Barrie scored at 5:19 of the third, sending a wrist shot from the top of the right circle in off the left post.
Seguin, frustrated by Grubauer on close-in shots, finally scored from the outside edge of the right circle.
NOTES: Johnson's goal, his first in 20 games, came on his 31st birthday. ... Barrie's 11th goal, his fourth in the past three games, was his 300th career point. ... Colorado acquired Grubauer in a trade with Washington completed during the 2018 NHL draft at the American Airlines Center, the Stars' home ice. ... Seguin's 28th goal ended a nine-game drought.

Avalanche: Return home Saturday for the first game of a back-to-back, home-and-home series with Chicago.

Kraig Becker,"When adventurous skiers and snowboarders venture into the backcountry, one of the most important pieces of gear that they carry with them is an avalanche beacon or transceiver. These devices produce a pulsed radio signal that can detect other beacons nearby, making it much easier to find someone who is buried under a mountain of snow by an avalanche. Skiers carrying a transceiver are far more likely to be found and rescued than those without one, which is why it is vital that they work properly at all times. To that end, Avalanche transceiver manufacturer Ortovox has issued what it calls a “precautionary” recall of its 3+ models of beacons. In a statement posted to its website, the company says that a bug in the device’s software has been discovered that could put users at risk. All devices running Ortovox software 2.1 are part of the recall. The error found in the code could potentially cause the device to temporarily stop transmitting a signal, which in theory could be the difference between life and death during a search and rescue operation. Ortovox says that there have been no known accidents due to this software bug, but in order to maintain a full level of safety, it is urging all 3+ owners running the problematic software to return their devices for an update. Version 2.2 of the software reportedly addresses the problem, ensuring that this all-important piece of gear continues to function as expected during emergency situations. In order to determine which version of the software your Ortovox 3+ transceiver is currently running, move the “search/send” switch to the “send” position. The button must be pushed in for it to properly display the information that you’re looking for. Next, switch the device on and watch the screen during its boot-up cycle. It will first display the 10-digit serial number for the beacon, followed by a display test screen and the remaining battery life. Finally, it will also show the version of the installed software. If your beacon happens to be running version 2.1, your device is covered under the recall. If the software is 1.1, 2.0, or 2.2, it is not affected. If no number is shown, the transceiver is running version 1.0 and is also not affected. To find out more, including how to contact Ortovox to have your device updated, visit the company’s website.","Backcountry ski and snowboard safety equipment manufacturer Ortovox is issuing what it calls a precautionary recall of its 3+ avalanche transceivers after discovering a software problem that could cause the devices to temporarily stop transmitting a signal, p…",2018-06-08T19:24:10Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Digitaltrends.com'}",Ortovox recalls avalanche transceivers to fix potentially risky software bug,https://www.digitaltrends.com/outdoors/ortovox-avalanche-transceiver-recall/,https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/ortovox-1-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg,,Digitaltrends.com,avalanche,1
JAMES PONIEWOZIK,"But as his career takes off, the seriess attention shifts to the old, sad soft-shoe of fame gone sour. There are women; there are pills; there are flashbacks to Fosse as a young dancer pushed to the breaking point. His frenzied tap dancing becomes a stressed-out leitmotif: slapping on tables, rapping on doors, clapping to indicate the cuts while editing a film, tap-tap-tap-tap.
This may be crazy talk, but usually the most interesting thing about artists is their art. Yes, its tough to dramatize creativity, but Fosse/Verdon, given such visual subject matter, should have a reasonable shot at it.
We get a glimpse of the pairs intellectual sync as Verdon coaches dancers through a sequence: Its not a seduction, its a con job. And the series emphasizes how Fosses choreography all those bent bodies and splayed hands could use delightful motion to convey agony, as in Whos Got the Pain? from Damn Yankees, portrayed as a kind of subliminal horror number.
Fosse/Verdon becomes overwhelmed by the pain, hitting every signpost of too-much-too-fast breakdown stories, an avalanche of awards trophies and bottles of Seconal. Verdon becomes professionally lost and her character often recedes. The series is based on the biography Fosse by Sam Wasson, and it has the feel of a Fosse story to which the /Verdon was appended. (The third episode delves into her early life, steering hard into melodrama.)
Theres something vampiric about Fosse, as his previous wife, Joan McCracken (Susan Misner), describes it: He takes whats special in a girl and makes it his own. This often extended to predatory relationships with his female cast members. Fosse/Verdon is conscious of this but also feels burdened by the responsibility to indict him, which only makes it more heavy-handed.
But the show is still something to look at. A re-creation of Liza Minnellis Mein Herr from Cabaret is a sexy, terrifying, centrifugal whirl. The fourth episode, centered on Fosses production of Pippin, ends with a musical interlude likening him to that shows self-absorbed protagonist. Its both terrible and amazing, thematically bludgeoning but audacious and emotional.","This dual Broadway biopic has style and moves but gets tripped up by an overfamiliar story of a brilliant, toxic man.",2019-04-08T18:51:12Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Review: In ‘Fosse/Verdon,’ a Portrait of the Artist as Problematic Fave",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/arts/television/fosse-verdon-review.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/08/arts/08fosse/08fosse-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,avalanche,1

Well, the above text could quite easily be fake, but I think the video itself is authentic. Yes, part of that belief is the Agent Mulder I-want-to-believe school of thought, but this video has enough scenes and set pieces to make faking it incredibly complex. Im not saying that its beyond someone, but itd be a mammoth undertaking. And for little pay-off. For the moment, lets just assume that its real. So whos making it? Well, theres some confusion over which development studio is making the Harry Potter RPG. In the Press Start piece, the author alleges that Rocksteady the team that made Batman: Arkham Asylum are creating it. But industry insiders on the Reset Era forum believe its being made by Avalanche Software, the business who made the Disney Infinity games. What lends some substance to this claim is that Warner (which hold the Harry Potter license) bought Avalanche Software (not to be confused with Avalanche Studios, who are the crew behind the Just Cause games) in January 2017. So, it kinda fits. On top of that, they also posted this job opening: If that doesnt sound like a Harry Potter -centric job, I dont know what does. Look, we might not know for a little while whether this game is actually being created let alone its release date and what platforms itll be on.

"Associated Press, Mary Hudetz, Associated Press","Emergency officials say an avalanche buried multiple people near the highest peak of a New Mexico ski resort on Thursday, including two who were pulled from the snow as ski patrols continued their search for others. (Jan 17)
 AP
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. An avalanche rushed down the mountainside of a New Mexico ski resort on Thursday, injuring two people who were pulled from the snow after a roughly 20-minute rescue effort, a resort spokesman said.
The avalanche near the highest peak of Taos Ski Valley happened around 11:30 a.m., initially spurring fears among authorities that more victims may be buried on the mountain before learning from witnesses that they had seen only two people on the slope at the time of the slide.
Still, both Chris Stagg, a spokesman for Taos Ski Valley, and Bobby Lucero, the director for emergency management in Taos County, said a search of the mountain was continuing as a precaution to ensure no other people remained trapped.
The extent of the injuries for the two people, both males, was not immediately known. But both were taken to hospitals.
The avalanche happened at 11:30 a.m. on a stretch of mountain known as the K3 chute, where expert skiers who ride a lift to Kachina Peak can dart down a partially rock-lined run. It was unknown what triggered the avalanche, but the ski resort said an investigation was planned.
Stagg said the accident happened despite a series of precautions Thursday morning that included sending ski patrollers up the mountain to evaluate conditions and detonate an explosive a measure meant to trigger a potential slide before skiers take to the slopes for the day. The resort also delayed opening the Kachina Ski Lift at the start of the day, Stagg said.
We had checked that area for avalanche conditions this morning and enacted controls, he said. This is a great example that youre never 100 percent certain.
Taos Ski Valleys terrain covers a 1,200-acre (or nearly 5-square-kilometers) area of the Sangre de Cristo mountain range. Its Kachina Peak is a nearly 12,500-foot (or 3,810-meter) summit.
George Brooks, the director of the nonprofit Ski New Mexico, which promotes the sport, said avalanches are fairly rare in the state, and typically terrain is very well controlled at the areas ski areas. The avalanche comes as the region enjoys one of its better ski seasons in recent years after a spell of dry winters.
A series of snow storms has moved across the Southwest since the start of the New Year, and another was expected to soon hit parts of the region after dropping heaving rain and snow in California.
If they occur, its not usually when anybody is around, Brooks said of New Mexico avalanches.
Taos Ski Valley had received 2 inches of snow in the last day and 15 inches in the last week, according to its website. The spot where the avalanche happened is prone to winds that can blow up the mountain and create a cornice, meaning avalanches can occur there even without a high level of recent snowfall, Brooks said.

"AP, AP","SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) Marcus Sorensen scored two goals in his return to the lineup from an injury and Joe Pavelski added his 36th goal of the season to lead the San Jose Sharks to a 4-3 victory over the Colorado Avalanche on Friday night.
Sorensen missed the final two games of San Jose's road trip after taking a puck to the face last Saturday at Columbus, but thrived on a line with newly acquired Gustav Nyquist and Joe Thornton for his first multigoal game of his career. He opened the scoring early in the first and added another in the closing minute of the second period.
Timo Meier also scored and Martin Jones made 24 saves for the Sharks, who began a stretch of 12 home games in the final 18 regular contests on a winning note.
Nikita Zadorov, Mikko Rantanen and Samuel Girard scored for the Avalanche, who had their six-game point streak snapped. Gabriel Landeskog added three assists.
Colorado missed a chance to move into the wild-card lead in the Western Conference. The Avalanche are tied with Dallas and Minnesota for the final two playoff spots in the conference, but have played one more game than those teams.
The Sharks took control with a dominant stretch late in the second period that led to Sorensen's second goal. They pinned Colorado into the defensive zone, preventing defensive pair Erik Johnson and Girard from getting off the ice for 3:27. The duo was gassed when Sorensen got position in front of the net to tap in a loose puck past Semyon Varlamov that gave San Jose a 3-1 lead.
Rantanen scored on the power play midway through the third to make it a one-goal game, but Pavelski answered on a power play for San Jose shortly after that to restore the two-goal margin.
Girard then scored with 6:33 remaining but Colorado couldn't get the equalizer.
The Sharks took the lead less than five minutes into the game when Thornton won an offensive zone draw and Burns fed Sorensen in front of the net for the goal.
San Jose added to that lead early in the second when Meier beat Varlamov from the top of the circle on a rush.
But Colorado answered quickly after that with Zadorov's shot through a screen from the point.
NOTES: Rantanen has points in six straight games. ... The Sharks were without two key players with D Erik Karlsson once again sidelined by a groin injury he re-injured Tuesday in Boston and F Evander Kane out with an undisclosed injury sustained in that game. ... Colorado D Ian Cole returned to the lineup after missing 11 games with a broken orbital bone around his left eye.

Ben Gilbert,"""Rage 2"" is essentially a superhero game when it comes to combat. You play as ""Walker, the last Ranger of Vineland"" — a man who carries a particular type of blood that gifts him with special powers. The long and short is ""Rage 2"" is a game where you'll both leap into the sky and run around blasting shotguns. The idea is that you chain together your special abilities with your arsenal, a la 2016's ""DOOM"" — fitting, given that ""Rage 2"" is a co-production of id Software and Avalanche Studios. The former is responsible for ""DOOM."" Here's how they describe it : ""Among the arrows [Walker] can choose from his Nanotrite ability quiver are the power to crush enemies into paste from above in a devastating slam attack or send them flying away from him with a lethal energy push. Walker will also learn to channel these Nanotrites into his weapons, pushing them into an awe-inspiring Overdrive, a unique skill that lets him push his guns beyond their limits and unleash absolute hell on his foes.""","""Rage 2"" is what happens when the open-world experience of ""Grand Theft Auto"" meets the sun-drenched post-apocalypse.

InSight Crime,"Screen grab Internal divisions may be splitting apart Mexico's most powerful crime group, and that could lead to even more bloodshed in a country still reeling from its most violent year on record. The latest indication of fragmentation within the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generación — CJNG) came on March 25 in the embattled border state of Tamaulipas, when a splinter faction of the CJNG known as the Northwest Cartel allegedly got into a deadly firefight with Mexican Marines. Officials say the Northwest Cartel is fighting the CJNG over control of a major drug trafficking route in Tamaulipas, a strategic area for criminal groups transporting drugs and other contraband into the United States. The shootout follows news earlier this month that the CJNG may have murdered a former member of the group named Ramón Sánchez Radilla, alias ""El Marro,"" who reportedly belonged to a breakaway faction of the CJNG known as ""El 2."" Another alleged member of El 2, Luis Emmanuel Rodríguez Cerros, alias ""El Cholo,"" was killed in August last year. El Cholo reportedly served as the right-hand man of CJNG boss Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias ""El Mencho."" But in March 2017, he and others — including El Marro — were exiled from the group and ordered killed for their apparent role in the murder of a Colombian CJNG collaborator. InSight Crime analysis State police officers carry the coffin of a colleague slain in a attack by Jalisco New Generation cartel gunmen, in Tlaquepaque, on the outskirts of Guadalajara, April 8, 2015. REUTERS/Alejandro Acosta The CJNG has taken advantage of the splintering and weakening of other Mexican crime groups, like the Sinaloa Cartel, which has seen signs of deepening internal discord and attacks by rival groups following the arrest and later extradition of former kingpin Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán. But the CJNG may now be suffering a fragmentation similar to the fissures that stripped the Sinaloa Cartel of its dominance. Both Jaime López, a security consultant and former police official in Mexico, and former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Mike Vigil said the fact that CJNG leader El Mencho is one of the most sought after drug capos in Mexico and the United States is partly to blame for the group's fragmentation. ""When you have a cartel leader that is running from the law and rival cartels, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage the organization, and that's when people within the organization seize upon opportunities to potentially take over,"" Vigil said. Vigil also suggested current Sinaloa Cartel leader Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada García may be stoking the fires of dissent within the CJNG. Police near the body of a person who died after a bus was torched by gunmen who blocked roads in Guadalajara during a military operation to arrest two leaders of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, March 9, 2012. REUTERS/Alejandro Acosta ""Even though they are enemies, I'm sure [El Mayo] has friends within the CJNG that he is pushing to cause an insurrection within the cartel,"" Vigil said. ""The Sinaloa Cartel and the CJNG are Mexico's only two powerful cartels, and by doing this he's diminishing the CJNG's power in order to put the Sinaloa Cartel back on top."" López and Vigil stressed that the fragmentation of the CJNG does not bode well for Mexico's broader security situation, and will likely contribute to a further escalation in violence. Lopéz said the CJNG has ""crossed the line with regards to violence towards federal agents and the military,"" and the escalating conflict with the Mexican government is putting pressure on the group that could be contributing to its fragmentation. Vigil warned that this could create a vicious cycle, especially given the CJNG's reputation for aggression against rivals as well as the state and the public. ""One of the things we know is that when fragmentation occurs, you have smaller groups that come into play and fight for the same territory, and that's going to lead to more violence against rivals, security officials and innocent people caught in the crossfire,"" Vigil told InSight Crime. The correlation between fragmented criminal groups and increased violence is a phenomenon seen elsewhere throughout the region. For example, after the demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), Colombia's criminal landscape was left severely fragmented. This ultimately led to increased violence as dissidents from the peace process and other criminal networks fought each other for control over criminally strategic areas vacated by the FARC.","Screen grab Internal divisions may be splitting apart Mexico’s most powerful crime group, and that could lead to even more bloodshed in a country still reeling from its most violent year on record.

"AP, AP","Colorado Avalanche left wing Gabriel Landeskog (92), of Sweden, fires a shot past Nashville Predators goalie Pekka Rinne (35), of Finland, to tie score during the third period in Game 5 of an NHL hockey first-round playoff series Friday, April 20, 2018, in Nashville, Tenn. The Avalanche won 2-1. (AP Photo/Sanford Myers) (Photo: The Associated Press) NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Injuries left the Avalanche playing their backup to the backup goaltender while needing a victory to stave off elimination. The goalie nicknamed the ""Hamburglar"" came through. Andrew Hammond made a career-high 44 saves for his first postseason victory, and Colorado rallied to beat the Nashville Predators 2-1 on Friday night and sent the first-round series back to Denver for Game 6. ""Obviously, it was a lot of fun,"" said Hammond, who was mobbed in the locker room. ""We're excited to have another game. We didn't want this to be the last one of the season, and I think to a man, we all did whatever we could to make sure that wasn't the case."" This is the third time the Avalanche had trailed 3-1 in a series since moving to Colorado. They lost the first two but have a chance Sunday to push the defending Western Conference champs to a seventh game after rallying with two goals in the final 4:11. They also became the first to win a playoff game in regulation when trailing in the final 5:00 of the third since Chicago won at Boston in Game 6 of the 2013 Stanley Cup Final. Gabriel Landeskog started the rally with his goal into an empty net with Nashville goalie Pekka Rinne caught outside the crease with his own teammate Ryan Ellis in his lap. Then Sven Andrighetto gave the Avs the lead off a rebound of a shot by J.T. Compher with 1:28 left that stunned a sold-out Nashville crowd that had expected to celebrate advancing to the second round. ""We've got a series again going home, and it's going to be exciting,"" Landeskog said. ""As we talked about before tonight, just to win one. We don't have to win three in one night."" This was not only Hammond's first playoff victory, it was his first postseason start since April 17, 2015, with Ottawa and just the third of his career. He started only one game during the regular season after being traded to Colorado in November. ""You never know when you're going to get a second chance,"" Hammond said. ""I've played two games basically since the start of January — at times it felt as though that day would never come again when you're going to play again. You keep battling in practice, you stick to the process, when you get your chance, you're ready."" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said he loved Hammond's demeanor since learning he would be starting. ""He's waited a long time this year for this opportunity, and he's making the most of it,"" Bednar said. The series winner will face Winnipeg in the second round. Nick Bonino scored for Nashville. This game was scoreless until Bonino's goal with 9:42 left, a big change for a series that had been the highest-scoring of the first round averaging 7.25 goals per game coming into Game 5. The Predators peppered Hammond, and the only time Nashville beat him was when Mattias Ekholm's shot bounced off his left pad and went in off Bonino's right skate. The official on the spot immediately waved it off. Officials huddled, then reviewed the play. During the review, fans sang ""Let It Be"" while holding up their cellphones with the flash on. Referee Kevin Pollock announced the call on the ice had been overturned, starting a long-awaited celebration. The lead didn't last long as the Avs rallied. ""It's not like we didn't have opportunities,"" Nashville coach Peter Laviolette said. ""They did a pretty good job in front of him. We had lots of looks, lots of opportunities. We couldn't get in."" The Avalanche came into the postseason with goalie Semyon Varlamov and defenseman Erik Johnson sidelined by knee injuries, then defenseman Samuel Girard missed three games with his own upper-body injury before Jonathan Bernier, Varlamov's backup, suffered his own lower-body injury. That pushed the Hamburglar into the net. The Predators started and ended the second period on the power play but couldn't beat Hammond. Their best scoring chance came with a 4-on-2, but Hammond stopped Roman Josi's shot and then handled Calle Jarnkrok's attempt off the rebound at 12:36. Hammond also made a big pad save on Ellis' slap shot and then stopped another Josi shot late in the period. NOTES: The Avalanche snapped a seven-game skid in Nashville with the win. They ended a 12-game skid to the Preds overall in Game 3.... Nashville had been perfect last postseason with a chance to clinch a series on its own ice, winning all three series to reach the Stanley Cup Final.... Predators forward Ryan Hartman sat out his suspension for a hit on Carl Soderberg in Game 4.

"USA TODAY Sports, Rachel Axon, USA TODAY Sports","Snowboarder and surfer Brock Crouch was hospitalized after suffering broken vertebrae in an avalanche. He was riding in the backcountry in Canada. (Photo: Red Bull) U.S. snowboarder and surfer Brock Crouch survived an avalanche which buried him alive for five minutes and broke three vertebrae. According to social media posts from his older brother and USA Surfing, Crouch was swept off an 80-foot cliff while riding in the backcountry in Canada on Sunday. Mike Glennie, Crouch’s older brother, wrote on Instagram that Crouch broke his T12, L1 and L2 vertebrae, lost teeth and hurt his face. Crouch, 18, is also on the U.S. Surf Team. USA Surfing wrote on Facebook that Crouch’s arms and legs are “working” and that he had no apparent internal injuries. “I know you stared death in the face yesterday brother but you also lived to talk about it,” Glennie wrote. “Bad things happen to good people and we will never know why, just know you’ve got an army of love and support and an older brother who loves the shit out of you. Heal up.” Steve Ruff, Crouch’s agent, said Crouch had X-rays on Wednesday morning and is awaiting results of an MRI. In photos on Crouch’s Instagram story, Crouch held up a peace sign from his hospital bed. Photos with pro snowboarders John Jackson and Cam FitzPatrick credited both with saving Crouch. Jackson wrote on Instagram that the avalanche swept Crouch down “multiple rock bands,” adding that the snowboarder was buried for four or five minutes before he was rescued. “Crazy how a situation like this can surprise you so quickly,” Jackson wrote. “I’m so glad the whole crew performed a rockstar rescue and Brock is strong enough to handle what he went down. Especially thankful for our pilot Josh, who didn’t waste a second in the situation. I was so impressed with this kids talent while we were riding all morning and know he will come back with a fury to continue getting after it.” Crouch won the FIS World Cup in 2016 that served as a test event for the Pyeongchang Olympic venue. The Carlsbad, Calif., native has competed in three X Games, finishing as high as seventh in slopestyle in his debut in 2017. Crouch is good friends with Olympic slopestyle gold medalist Red Gerard, who wrote on Instagram on Tuesday, “Some crazy stuff has gone down in the last 24 hours and I am just so happy my best friend is still here with us.""","U.S. snowboarder and surfer Brock Crouch was buried for five minutes  during an avalanche in Canada on a trip riding in the backcountry.

DENVER (AP) Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen scored power-play goals early in the first period, helping the Colorado Avalanche end a six-game slide with a 6-1 win over the New York Rangers on Friday night.
Gabriel Landeskog added a goal off his right skate, Alexander Kerfoot tipped in a shot, Rantanen deflected in yet another and Ryan Graves closed out the scoring with his first career NHL goal as a struggling Avalanche squad won for the first time since Dec. 19.
Colorado finished 3 of 10 on the power play, with two of the goals scored following a 5-minute boarding call on former Avalanche player Cody McLeod just 2 1/2 minutes in.
Philipp Grubauer made 24 saves, including one on a penalty shot by Jimmy Vesey late in the third.
Ryan Strome scored the Rangers' lone goal midway through third period on a night they were outshot by a 47-25 margin. Alexandar Georgiev attempted to keep things close while giving Henrik Lundqvist a night off. Lundqvist was pulled Wednesday after allowing six goals in a loss to Pittsburgh.
Tyson Barrie had three assists to give him 278 career points, the most by a defenseman in franchise history. Barrie broke the mark held by John-Michael Liles.
After the morning skate, the Avalanche reiterated over and over the importance of a fast start to break out of their 0-4-2 skid.
This helped their cause: Going on the power play early when McLeod slammed the face of defenseman Samuel Girard into the glass on a big hit. MacKinnon scored on a high wrist shot over Georgiev's glove at 4:40, with Rantanen adding another 2:13 later when his pass went in off the stick of New York defenseman Neal Pionk.
Colorado was getting all the bounces, with Landeskog knocking in a goal with his right skate midway through the second period. The Avalanche led 5-0 in the third before Strome ended Grubauer's shutout bid on a breakaway.
Graves scored his first career goal following a rebound in the third. He was selected by New York in the fourth round of the 2013 draft, before being dealt to Colorado last February.
MacKinnon and Landeskog each have 25 goals this season. What's more, Landeskog, MacKinnon and Rantanen now have combined for 175 points this season.
NOTES: Rangers C Kevin Hayes missed the game with an upper body injury. ... Avalanche G Semyon Varlamov remains day-to-day with a lower body injury. ... The Avalanche are stumping for Landeskog to make the All-Star team through the ""Last Men In"" vote from the fans. There were buttons and signs that read, ""Vote Gabe in."" He appreciated the gesture. ""But it's not something I'm going to lose sleep over or anything like that,"" Landeskog said.
UP NEXT:
Rangers: Stop No. 2 on a three-game trip will be Sunday in Arizona.
Avalanche: Open a five-game trip Tuesday in Winnipeg.
