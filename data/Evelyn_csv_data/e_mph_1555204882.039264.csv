Jack Stewart,"When Randal Miles woke up from a nap during his flight from Paris to Los Angeles last week, he opened the interactive map on his seat-back screen to see how much longer he'd be in the air. But the number that caught his eye was the jet's speed. The Norwegian jet was flying at 770 mph—about 200 mph faster than its standard cruising velocity. “I thought, ‘Damn, this thing is hauling ass,’” Miles says. “I thought I was either sleepy or it was reading wrong.” Miles isn’t the only traveler who has gotten the giddy-up treatment in the past couple of weeks. On Thursday, a Norwegian 787 on the same route briefly hit an even faster 779 mph for part of its trip, with a tailwind of 224 mph. And on Friday, yet another Norwegian plane used the jet stream to set a new speed record for a subsonic transatlantic crossing. The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner went from New York’s JFK Airport to London’s Gatwick in 5 hours and 13 minutes. It beat British Airways' 2015 record by three minutes and outpaced the standard crossing by half an hour. (The Concorde still holds the ultimate record among commercial aircraft: 2 hours, 53 minutes.) So how does a standard Boeing jet carrying a full complement of passengers and luggage fly so fast? By taking advantage of a particularly vigorous jet stream, a current of air rushing from west to east, across the Atlantic. During Norwegian's record-setting flight, that tailwind reached 202 mph and pushed a Boeing that usually cruises at 570 mph to 776 mph. “If it had not been for forecasted turbulence at lower altitude, we could have flown even faster,” says pilot Harold van Dam. On Friday, a another Norwegian plane set a new speed record for a subsonic transatlantic crossing. The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner went from New York’s JFK Airport to London’s Gatwick in 5 hours and 13 minutes. Airlines have long made use of the transatlantic jet stream to save time and fuel when flying from the US to Europe. “The airlines look at forecasted winds and they supply air traffic controllers with their preferred routing,” says Ian Petchenik, a spokesperson for FlightRadar24, which tracks flights all over the world. Controllers then aggregate those requests and set specific flight paths for the day that will keep everyone safe and as happy as possible. The results are known as North Atlantic Tracks. Those are the green lines in the image below (from 1/17/18 at 0400 UTC), and you can see the planes plotted along them. That rainbow in the middle marks wind speed, with red signifying the most intense part of the Jetstream. (For the return trip, the airlines request paths and altitudes that limit the need to fight fierce headwinds, but those flights still take longer and burn more fuel.) This image (from 1/17/18 at 0400 UTC), shows the set flight paths, and the planes plotted along them. That rainbow in the middle marks wind speed, with red signifying the most intense part of the Jetstream. OK, about that ""subsonic"" bit. You might know that the speed of sound at an altitude of 30,000 to 40,000 feet is roughly 670 mph. But Norwegian’s planes didn't break the sound barrier. Those near-800-mph figures represent ground speed—how fast the aircraft is moving over land. Their air speed, which factors out the 200-mph wind boost, was closer to the 787's standard Mach 0.85. (The older Boeing 747 can cruise at Mach 0.86, but is less efficient than its younger stablemate.) When talking supersonic, and breaking sound barriers, it's all about the speed of the air passing over the wings, which in this case was more like 570 mph. The hot and heavy jet stream isn't all good. The high winds can increase turbulence, which pilots must work to avoid to protect planes and the passengers on board. And while these fast flights provide a nice publicity bump for Norwegian, airlines typically opt for fuel efficiency over top speed. They use the jet stream to surf a little and cut fuel consumption—like taking your foot off your car's gas pedal as you go downhill. An unexpectedly fast trip can actually just mean being kept in a holding pattern above the destination airport, or stuck on the ground, waiting for a landing slot or open gate. Airlines and airports operate on strict schedules, and showing up half an hour early isn't super cool. Forecasts say the strong jet stream should last for a few more days, at least. “You get good days and bad days in any year,” Petchenik says. But as climate change intensifies, atmospheric scientists are looking for possible deviations within the usually reliable river of wind that circles the planet. A recent study suggests the polar jet stream is fluctuating more than normal, but the long-term impact on the Atlantic jet stream which powers these fast flights remains TBD. For now, passengers just have to relax and enjoy an especially quick or efficient hop across the pond—until it's time to head back.","A 200-mph jet stream has sent several passenger jets to nearly 800 mph, and helped break a (subsonic) speed record.",2018-01-23T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","Riding a Wild Wind, a Norwegian 787 Breaks a Speed Record",https://www.wired.com/story/norwegian-air-transatlantic-speed-record/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a664137e9d03b6481cb8acb/191:100/pass/Norwegian-Plane-2.jpg,wired,Wired,mph,1
Joe Lindsey,"When you’re trying to become the fastest self-propelled human on the planet, you wouldn’t expect getting going at all to be the hardest part. But Denise Mueller-Korenek rides a bicycle so intense, even she can hardly pedal it. At least, not at the speeds hit by any sane cyclist. Once she’s going Autobahn speeds, though, she can unhook from the drag racing car that tows her off the line and start to crank the gear around. Drafting off the steadily accelerating racer and spinning up the rpm's on the bike’s compound reduction gear, she’ll have two and a half minutes to reach the goal that brought her to Utah’s Bonneville Salt Flats this weekend: set the motor-paced bicycle land speed record. Which right now stands at 167 miles per hour. Accelerating past the takeoff speed of a Boeing 757 on a bike seems impossible, but a top-flight cyclist riding a remarkable bike and drafting the right vehicle piloted by the right driver can make it happen. That is, as long as everything—from physics to fitness, technology to team—works perfectly. At 45 years old, Mueller-Korenek may be the ideal candidate. As a junior cyclist she won 13 national championships in road, track, and mountain bike racing, before anxiety led her to quit the sport. She spent the next 20 years running a business, raising three sons, skydiving, and racing Mini Coopers. She returned to bike racing five years ago and won two more age-group national titles. Even now, few men can hold her wheel when she opens up a sprint, says her coach, John Howard, who set a previous record, at 152 mph, in 1985. And she has the technical skills to match her explosive aerobic engine. “She’s a world-class bike handler.” Howard, who coached Mueller-Korenek when she was a junior, got her back into the sport with a simple truth: No woman had ever attempted a speed record. “That was like a match to gasoline,” says Mueller-Korenek. This weekend’s attempt comes two years after Mueller-Korenek hit 147.7 mph on her bike at Bonneville, setting the women’s speed record (by virtue of being the first woman to try it). She had planned to go for the all-time mark the next day, but thunderstorms rolled in, drenching the salt flats and nixing her chance. The speedy cyclist has changed a few details since, but the core of her approach hasn’t changed. It’s all about having the right equipment and the right team. Pedal to the Mental For a vehicle that will reach such eye-tearing speed, Mueller-Korenek’s KHS bike has the approximate aerodynamics of a chopper motorcycle—the wind-blocking car means the bike can serve other priorities. At 35 pounds and more than 7 feet long, it’s twice the size of a normal bike. The low-slung frame features geometry cribbed from the bike that Dutch cyclist Fred Rompelberg used to set the existing record at 167 mph in 1995. The walls of the hollow carbon-fiber frame tubes are three times thicker than those of conventional frames. The 17-inch tires were swiped from a motorcycle, since no cycling rubber is rated for anything near these speeds. A steering stabilizer and a custom-tuned suspension fork borrowed from downhill racing dampen irregularities in the unpaved salt track. The compound reduction gear—essentially two drivetrains joined together—is five times larger than a conventional racing bike’s top gear. That’s why pedaling from a standstill is like trying to start a car in sixth gear. At 35 pounds and more than 7 feet long, Mueller-Korenek's KHS bike has motorcycle tires and a compound reduction gear setup optimized for riding at triple-digit speeds. Just as important as the bike is the car. Mueller-Korenek will draft an 800-horsepower Top Alcohol dragster—the same one Rompelberg used. It accelerates more smoothly than the supercharged Range Rover SVR she used in 2016, but its aerodynamic fairing creates a low-pressure draft pocket just 46 inches wide, leaving Mueller-Korenek little lateral maneuvering room. The woman working the gas pedal, however, hasn’t changed. Shea Holbrook didn’t jump at Mueller-Korenek’s invitation to join her team in 2016. Then 26, she already had a résumé full of four-wheel racing experience. But this was different. “It’s one thing to put me in a bomb that goes 300 mph,” Holbrook says. “Here, I have someone’s life in my hands.” Then she and Mueller-Korenek got on the phone. “It was like we’d known each other for 10 years,” Holbrook says. “This was a meant-to-be friendship.” That bond matters when a cyclist and driver are trying to go triple-digit speeds within a few feet of each other. “The physics of the draft mean we have to be in perfect harmony,” says Mueller-Korenek. She has to follow closely enough that the negative pressure pocket in the car’s wake helps pull her along. She calls it “the dance.” The dance floor is the Bonneville Salt Flats, a 30,000-acre salt pan near the Utah-Nevada border, one of the few places in the world with the space and the flat, uniform surface needed for a speed record trial. The Short Course track is 5 miles long. After a few low(er)-speed practice runs, Mueller-Korenek will make as many record attempts as she can in the three-day window at this weekend’s World of Speed, sharing the track with car and motorcycle enthusiasts going for their own records. To start the run, Mueller-Korenek is attached to the dragster with a tether. It’s a rough way to get going, but it works. “The faster I’m going the more stable I am,” Mueller-Korenek says. “If she drags me up slowly, I’ll fall.” Holbrook will feather the throttle to pull as smoothly and quickly as possible over the first mile, which should get her to 110 mph. Then Mueller-Korenek will release the tether, and Holbrook will accelerate to around 130 or 140 mph, monitoring Mueller-Korenek’s nonverbal communications via a camera: nods to accelerate, head shakes to back off. A color-coded series of lights on the back of the dragster will show Mueller-Korenek how far they’ve gone, and how much track is left. To secure the record, Mueller-Korenek—now pedaling around 110 rpm—will have to hold 168 mph between mile markers 4 and 5, where the timing traps measure her average speed. As Holbrook accelerates, the cyclist will push 700 watts for more than a minute to stay inside the draft pocket behind the dragster’s fairing. That’s about what a Tour de France sprinter produces in the final minute of a stage. Any object in motion creates turbulence. But a bluff body, like this fairing, creates a series of alternating vortices that swirl in its wake. “There’s a back-and-forth sensation,” Mueller-Korenek says. As she drifts back, the oscillation feels like being pushed forward on a swing. “At 130 mph, it’s a little kid push,” she says. “Over 150, it’s like an NBA player giving me a shove.” Her job is to deal with those forces while keeping her 7-foot bike inside the 10-foot pocket of air. At 168 mph. After a successful junior racing career, Mueller-Korenek left the sport for two decades. She sees this speed record attempt as an effort to make up for time lost—and show what she can do. So it’s obvious things can go wrong in a hurry. If Holbook misses a head shake and Mueller-Korenek can’t hold the draft, the turbulence could force her into a violent crash. She’ll wear a motorcycle helmet, gloves, and a leather-and-Kevlar street-luge suit, but it’s no guarantee of safety. In 1988, seven years before he set the record, Rompelberg crashed at almost 150 mph at Bonneville. He broke 24 bones. For Mueller-Korenek, though, the risk is worth it. This weekend’s attempt is about unfinished business. An opportunity, as she puts it, to “right the wrong” of how she left cycling for all those years. An opportunity to finish what she started in 2016. And the opportunity to occupy a rare firmament: a woman setting a record historically dominated by men. That’s what drew her to this quest, years ago, when Howard told her no woman had ever attempted it. “How often do you get the chance to be a pioneer, and do something that no one else ever has?” This time, it’s not just something no woman has ever done; it’s something no one, period, ever has.

Vlad Savov,"That’s more than one football field per second, end zones included It takes a lot for a petrol-fueled car to nudge out all of the hyper electrics that attract eyeballs at the Geneva Motor Show, but Koenigsegg has done it. The new Jesko by Koenigsegg, named after the company founder’s father, is claimed to be the world’s first road-legal 300 mph car. That top speed translates to more than 480 kilometers per hour. To put it in more relatable terms, this car can travel fast enough to cover the length of a football field — doesn’t matter which version of football you prefer — in less than a second. When you think of it in those terms, you’ll probably also realize just how theoretical performance like that is: there aren’t many straight lines in the world long enough to let a person hit such ludicrous speeds. Koenigsegg is producing only 125 units of the Jesko, with a choice between the so-called top speed version that achieves the headline-grabbing 300 mph and a more track-oriented variant, the latter of which is on show in Geneva this week. Despite a mind-melting $2.8 million starting price before tax, 90 of the cars had already been pre-sold before the Jesko’s official unveiling, and Koenigsegg’s been doing brisk business during the show, with expectations that the company will leave Switzerland with all its Jesko orders filled. Built around a redesigned 5-liter twin-turbo V8 engine, the Koenigsegg Jesko can hit 1,280 horsepower with regular gasoline or 1,600 horsepower on E85 biofuel. It has the world’s lightest crankshaft (weighing 12.5 kilograms / 27.5 pounds), which is milled from a single billet of steel and helps the engine work more efficiently. There’s also an acoustic benefit to the new crankshaft design, which Koenigsegg says helps to produce an “even more visceral engine sound.” A new nine-speed Light Speed Transmission system has been designed in-house, promising ”gear changes [that] occur in virtually zero time between adjacent gears.” It’s accompanied by an Ultimate Power On Demand predictive gear-changing technology that will ensure “instant, prolific power that’s always optimised and always available, allowing maximum acceleration for overtaking, corner exits, etc.” Koenigsegg has added active rear steering to the Jesko, which helps improve cornering and reduce the car’s turning circle. At low speeds, the rear wheels are steered counter to the front ones, while at high speeds, they turn in the same direction. (Determining when to do what is entirely automated by the car.) The same can be said for the active rear wing as well, and there’s a lot of other adaptive engineering all around the Jesko. It’s a car with racing smarts, even if it’s not running the latest and greatest infotainment software. For all its engineering excellence and spec supremacy, the Koenigsegg Jesko is an attraction at the Geneva Motor Show this week simply because it looks stunning. None of the super, hyper, ultra — or, in the case of the Jesko, mega because it’s capable of more than a megawatt of power — cars at the exhibition ever actually move, and so it’s down to their design to do all the talking. The Jesko looks every bit the road racer that it’s intended to be. Aerodynamics dictate the signature expansive windshield up front, but it’s been redesigned for greater visibility. The carbon fiber chassis has also been made more accommodating with increased legroom and headroom. Combining those design priorities of speed and comfort with a measure of visual flair has produced the assertive beauty on show in Geneva. Oh, and the hardtop is detachable. The extremely lucky humans ordering a Jesko this week will have to be patient, as production of the cars is planned for late 2020, with deliveries expected in early 2021.

Jack Stewart,"Ask any serious automaker about the future of driving, and they'll bring up batteries and zero emissions, the glory of instant torque and the anxiety of underdeveloped charging infrastructure. But you don't have to build things on four wheels to see where the road leads. Today at CES in Las Vegas, Harley-Davidson announced it has started taking pre-orders for the LiveWire, the all-electricmotorcycle it first showed off in 2014.
Along with the technical question of making batteries work on a bike, Harley as a brand faces two challenges before it starts deliveries of the $29,799 bike this fall. It must persuade its fans that a motorcycle without that loud parppping engine is a legitimate cruising machines. And it has to convince potential new customers that they dont need tattoos and eagle-emblazoned leather jackets to join the club.
For the die-hard fans, Harley designed the LiveWire not to stand out in a line of bikes outside a roadside diner as the Prius of the motorcycle world. And like Tesla did for cars, Harley is working to show riders electric motors can make riding more fun. The bike will to go from 0 to 60 mph in under 3.5 seconds, with 100 percent of the motor torque available instantly. Itll cover 110 miles on a charge, and the battery will be capable of fast charging from the same CCS connector that cars use. The lithium ion cells are cooled by cast-aluminum fins on a housing that sits between the riders knees, and has hints of an air-cooled engine. The motor and battery sit low in the frame, keeping the center of gravity near the asphalt for better handling and control. That also makes the bike easier to balance when stopped.
For the new customers that Harley hopes to win, its emphasizing how crazy easy an electric motorbike is to ride. Theres no clutch, no gear shifting, just twist and go. And like an electric car, the motor acts as a generator when slowing down, for regenerative braking, putting electrons back into the battery and also making stop and go traffic easier to deal with. Instead of throttle, shift, brake, shift, its twist to go, let go to slow. The bike of course comes with a host of connected features and an app. Check on a charge remotely, and get tamper alerts straight to your phone.
To quiet the riders who argue a loud bike is a safety featuremaking them more noticeable to oblivious driversthe LiveWire wont be completely silent. Like Jaguar did with its electric I-Pace SUV, Harley has made a new sound to help communicate speed to a rider, and presumably people around them. Its a tone that increases in pitch and volume with speeda new sound that represents the smooth, electric power of the LiveWire motorcycle, says the company's press release.
Harley isnt the only two-wheeled EV player. Zero Motorcycles offers four models, as well as versions for police and military uses, and just announced it's got an entirely new bike, called the SR/F, coming up.
And Harley-Davidson wants the techie folks at CES to know that the LiveWire is just the start of a new focus for the brand. Its also showing two lightweight electric bike concepts, which take stripped-back to an extreme. One looks like a BMX bike, with a battery behind the front wheel, and the other could be an awesome city bike, with a huge space for cargo under the saddle. Theyre a much more futuristic version of an electric future for the venerable brand, and like many of the ideas shown at CES, may never make it into consumers hands. But they do show that the electric transport revolution isnt limited to cars.","Unveiled today at CES, the LiveWire will hit 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and cover 110 miles between charging stops.",2019-01-07T20:11:38Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Harley-Davidson's Electric LiveWire Motorcycle Debuts at CES,https://www.wired.com/story/harley-davidson-electric-motorcycle-livewire/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5c339276e91b067f6d57dfba/191:100/pass/Transpo-HarleyDavidson-Electric-w.jpg,wired,Wired,mph,1
Darrell Etherington,"Tesla has unveiled its all-electric semi truck, aptly dubbed the ‘Tesla Semi,’ as promised, and the resulting Class 8 transport vehicle is indeed a sight to behold. It boasts a considerable charge capacity, and has a very aesthetically distinct look, as you can see, which will obviously help it stand out from other commercial freight vehicles on the road. The Tesla Semi will go 0 to 60 mph in just 5 seconds, which is incredibly fast compared to a diesel truck. It can go 0 to 60 mph towing 80,000 lbs, its max tow load, in just 20 seconds. It can go 65 mph up a 5 percent grade, which is way better than the 45 mph max that a diesel competitor can do. And for range, it can go 500 miles at highway speed, and less than 80 percent trips are at 250 miles. It also has a better drag coefficient than a super car thanks to its extremely aerodynamic design. The real secret weapon of the truck, however, isn’t that it can turn into a giant fighting robot (this feature hasn’t been activated yet, if it does exist, and Tesla won’t admit that it does). Instead, it’s that the truck offers a transmission that requires no shifting of gears (as is normal for fully electric vehicles) with regenerative braking that provides “basically infinite” brake life per Tesla. Tesla also says that the Semi outperforms its diesel rivals in terms of responsiveness and handling, and can cover more miles than a diesel semi truck in the same timespan, with safer operation in and around regular traffic. It also uses a number of Model 3 components to maximize production efficiencies, including individual Model 3 motors for each wheel, and even Model 3 inset door handles. Another standout for Tesla’s Semi lies in its design – the company points out that that cabin is tailor-made for drivers, with starts that are designed to make it easier to get in and out, and the ability to stand fully when inside the cab. The driver is also centered in the cab relative to the road, a unique twist on vehicle design in general, but a logical one for a car class that almost never has a passenger. There’s a removable jump seat for a passenger, too, offset and behind the main driver position. Tesla has also added not one, but two of its favorite in-cabin vehicle features to the Semi: Touchscreens. These are positioned on either side of the driver and offer navigation information, blind spot monitoring, and trip data logging applications. There’s also a suite of fleet management and routing tools, which Tesla says would ordinarily require third-party add-on hardware to incorporate into a car. Electric trucks aren’t the exclusive purview of Musk and Tesla, of course. There’s the somewhat trollishly named Nikola, which is working on a hybrid hydrogen powered electric powertrain, which its building with Bosch. Also, Daimler has revealed its own concept for a Mitsubishi E-FUSO fully electric Vision One truck with 220 miles of range, but with no specified release window. What’s the big deal about an electric semi truck? It’s a fair question, especially given the range of traditional Diesel engine heavy duty trucks. These can have ranges of up to nearly 900 miles on a single tank. But the long-term advantages of electric trucks could make a lot of sense, both from a relatively obvious ecological perspective, which is obvious, and from the perspective of cost-effectiveness. Electric trucks could be longer-lived and less expensive to maintain over the long term, and the cost to refuel them over their lifetimes should be far less than the cost to operate a truck that uses an internal combustion engine. Tesla says the Semi requires “significantly less maintenance” than a diesel truck, in particular because it lacks the high-strain moving parts of internal combustion engine vehicles, including the engine, transmission, after-treatment system and differentials. The Tesla Semi also offers advanced safety features, with a special battery design that reinforces the battery units themselves and also helps lower the center of gravity of the truck overall thanks to their positioning in the chassis. The windshield is also built of glass designed to resist impacts, and the truck is made to avoid jackknifing, a common problem for this class of truck, by automatically detecting any stability that could lead to this issue and torquing each wheel accordingly, whose also activating the brakes as needed. Surround view cameras try to eliminate blind sots, and also help to support object detection, providing alerts to the driver automatically when they identify potential hazards. Tesla has also built Enhanced Autopilot features into its Semi, which is not surprising given the work it’s done pioneering and refining these drier assistance features on its lineup of consumer cars. On the Semi, Tesla’s Autopilot offers automated emergency braking, lane keeping and lane departure warnings to help encourage safe highway driving. This is definitely a futuristic version of the modern transport truck, with a lot of bells and whistles that indeed look like they could make the lives of both freight shipping companies and drivers much more comfortable and convenient overall. The focus on drivers, in particular, is interesting as it appears as though Tesla is hoping to gain support for its trucking from ground-up endorsement, as well as by appealing to the long-term financial reasoning of the shipping companies themselves. OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA This version of the truck is a day truck, without a sleeper and designed for short hauls accordingly. But Tesla said it could easily extend the cab to accommodate a sleeper cabin, and then extend the underlying battery pack to support that, too. It can also be used with or without the aerodynamic cowling above the hood, depending on the height of the trailer it’s pulling. Tesla will probably still face a lot of challenges in terms of both getting this truck built at scale, and encouraging broad adoption. But it’s sticking to its playbook of looking at an industry where the legacy players have done something one way for a long time with relatively little in the way of innovation, and changing things drastically. The question is whether applying this model will continue to work in its favor.","It boasts a considerable charge capacity, and has a very aesthetically distinct look, as you can see, which will obviously help it stand out from other commercial freight vehicles on the road.

Aarian Marshall,"You don’t really have to have been to New York City to know that traffic is bad there. Its soundtrack is car horns, its symbol the taxi, its common language whining about the gridlock on the West Side Highway. But New York traffic has, in fact, gotten worse. The average downtown Manhattan taxi moved at 9.35 mph in 2010, but was inching at 6.8 mph by 2016. The numbers are even worse in the heart of midtown, where the average taxi travels at 4.7 mph—a speed easily matched on foot by any real New Yorker. Part of the problem is that New Yorkers seem to be driving more than they did a few years ago. The economy has improved, meaning more people are out and about and spending money. Meanwhile, subway service has dropped and bus ridership is down, pushing more locals toward drivers’ seats. (Vehicle registration is up 9 percent in the city since 2012.) And the rise of ride-hailing services like Uber, Lyft, and Via haven’t helped matters— recent research suggests the number of taxi and ride-hail vehicles zipping around downtown Manhattan during weekdays jumped 59 percent between 2013 and 2017, even after accounting for the drop in cab fares. Now the city finally seems ready to do something about the mess. Something specific, and something other places have made work for them: a congestion charge. Change the price of driving to reflect the activity’s true cost—in time, efficiency, and pollution—and you just might change people’s behavior. Such schemes have succeeded (to various extents) in Sweden, Great Britain, Norway, and Singapore. In January, a task force convened by the New York state legislature put out a 35-page initial analysis on how to get it done. The group proposes what’s called a cordon charge. It’s a flat $11.52 fee on personal vehicles and a $25.34 fee on trucks entering the busiest section of Manhattan (below 60th Street) from 6 am to 8 pm on weekdays. And they propose those charges be complemented by a $2 to $5 flat fee on taxi and ride-hail trips during those crowded hours, for an extra $355 million in revenue. They estimate that it would cut congestion by 13 percent and generate over $1 billion annually, to be pumped back into the city’s transit system, making the most virtuous of circles. New York isn’t the only place toying with such ideas. State legislators in California are considering a bill that would allow busy downtowns to implement their own congestion pricing schemes, setting their sights on four unspecified locations in Northern and Southern California. (Expect the LA and Bay Area to make appearances.) And it’s not the first time New York has considered congestion pricing, either. A plan from the Mayor Michael Bloomberg a decade ago went down in a storm of political acrimony. At heart, this is about behavioral economics. If the city pushes on this lever—say, hiking the cost to drive your own car into Manhattan—what happens? Will people choose the subway? Or will they choose a taxi instead? What if it pulls on that lever, raising fees on taxis and Ubers so that only the very wealthy can afford to take a solo ride in one? Which is better for the city as a whole? ""You have people who are relatively well off in the back seat riding by themselves on the most expensive land in America. It’s a space problem, not a morality problem."" It doesn't help that congestion schemes are supposed to inflict pain. “The object of a congestion charge is for people to cut down on unnecessary trips in their own vehicles, or solo trips in a taxi or car service,” says Sarah Kaufman, who studies transportation technology at New York University’s Rudin Center for Transportation. “It should affect people’s behavior, and it should force them to take mass transit and buses, or at least use a ride-share service like Lyft Line or Via, instead of a solo trip in an Uber or Lyft or taxi.” But what do you do if none of the levers do what you expect? “What worries me—the reason why I got into looking into this at all—is you could do a full-fledged congestion pricing program and people would not see the effects, because you’re going against the headwind of rapid Uber and Lyft trip growth,” says Bruce Schaller, who served as the city’s deputy commissioner for traffic and planning in the Bloomberg administration, and now runs a transportation consultancy in the city. Schaller’s research addresses a central worry for policy wonks in the midst of the ride-hailing boom: how to make a trip cheap enough to be fair but expensive enough to shift riders off the streets and into public transit. Instead of the cordon charge on for-hire vehicles, Schaller proposes an hourly charge in the designated zone, up to $50 for a taxi or Uber or whatever, for a total $670 million in annual transit funds just from those services alone. That should hike the average trip through crowded central Manhattan from $10 to somewhere closer to $24. He wants trucks to pay hourly fees too, though sticks with the task force’s plan to have personal cars pay once per day. Schaller aims to make any private taxi trip inside the congestion zone as expensive as driving your personal car and parking it, $25 to $35 a day. He wants to penalize ""deadheading,"" where drivers trawl for riders, clogging things up. (One-third of vehicles in the busiest sections of Manhattan are deadheading during peak hours, Schaller concludes.) And he wants to push people into ride-shares like Uber Pools, Lyft Lines, and Via, which pack in as many passengers into vehicles as possible. If you’re willing to ride with randos, you get to pay for less of that $50 fee. ""You have people who are relatively well off in the back seat riding by themselves on the most expensive land in America,"" Schaller says. ""I don't think there’s room for them. It’s just a space problem, not a morality problem."" The plan has its imperfections. There’s no clear way to figure out which passengers should pick up which portion of the hourly charge, since drivers will spend some of each hour with no one in the backseat. The fact that many drivers flip between Uber and Lyft from one fare to the next further muddies the picture. Moreover, charging by the hour instead of by the ride might shift the burden from the passenger to the driver, which seems unfair given the recent debates over how much—or little—these men and women actually make. The ride-hailing companies, meanwhile, are generally in favor of congestion charges, especially ones that don’t penalize ride-hail passengers any more than personal car owners. In fact, they’d really like a charge that rewards customers for not driving alone. “There should be a simple, fair charge to account for the impact of all types of vehicles on the most congested Manhattan streets,” the public policy wonks at Via, Uber, Lyft, Zipcar, and research institutions like the National Research Defense Council and the Regional Plan Association, wrote in an open letter to Governor Cuomo sent in January. “All take up space on the streets and contribute to congestion.” There are other political battles to wage, too. Despite some momentum, congestion pricing in New York faces fierce opposition locally and in the state assembly, driven in part by questions over whether the plan unfairly penalizes low-income drivers coming from the outer boroughs. (Research suggests just 4 percent of Manhattan's drivers come from those places, and that 4 percent of those live below the federal poverty line.) So, for now, New York will study its options and consider its levers. And know that it might not get it right.

Jack Stewart,"Ask the oracles about the future of the auto industry and you'll hear a lot of murmuring about an all-electric future featuring shared autonomous shuttles shuffling around city centers. They may be right, but in today's auto industry it's size that sells. Pickup trucks remain rolling ATMs for American and Japanese automakers. For the Europeans, the crisp bank notes come from giant coupes: Take an SUV, subtract some practicality, add a dose of style and a few cow herds' worth of leather. The results—vehicles like the Mercedes GLC coupe and BMW 6-series—are popular for a sporty look with a high, commanding driving position. And they command a high price to go with it. At the Geneva Motor Show this week, Jaguar Land Rover debuted its latest entry into this growing field: the Range Rover SV Coupe. The luxury ride, which starts at $295,000, looks like a two-door, squished version of the Range Rover Sport, or a Range Rover Velar with an even more sloping back. In other words, it fits right in. Before we continue, a few words about automotive jargon. As marketers apply the sportiest names to the most ungainly machines, body style definitions are growing increasingly wooly. Range Rover's use of the word ""coupe"" is unusual—this is an SUV, after all—but at least the thing fits the technical definition, with two doors and a fixed roof. What most people would call ""sedans"" (or in Britannia, ""saloons"") BMW and Mercedes now call four-door coupes, or sport activity vehicles, or grand tourers of some sort. The point is, these words don't mean much anymore, so don't pay too much attention to them. So let's look at the reality of this new SV Coupe. Making a Range Rover harder to climb into sounds ridiculous— how will the queen make her entrance? —but the new proportions make the car seem more eager and powerful, even if it’s less practical. If you do clamber into the back, you’ll find two super-plush rear seats with quilted stitching. If you want, they’re available in a different color than the fronts, for a two-tone look. And once settled, you can close the two doors with the push of a button. Jaguar Land Rover is preparing for the electric future, but this vehicle is not part of that plan. The 5-liter, turbocharged V8 engine should be good for a 5-second sprint from 0 to 60 mph. Of course, nobody is ever going to take this thing off-road, but it comes with the usual Terrain Response 2 system, which can tackle the toughest obstacles, just in case the driver decides they have something to prove. The SV Coupe is no historical aberration. It’s not the first two-door Range Rover. The company offered a two-door version of the Evoque when the baby SUV entered production, but recently withdrew the option from the US market. And classic Range Rovers from the 1970s used the two-door look to signal more utility than luxury, particularly in the popular mustard-yellow paintwork. If you're into the modern rehash of the look and don't mind spending McLaren money on an SUV, move quickly. Jaguar Land Rover's Special Vehicle Operations Technical Center in the UK will build just 999 copies of the car, starting sales at the end of this year. If you miss this round, fear not. Range Rover seems intent on filling every conceivable niche, and it'll likely find buyers wherever it goes. But it faces competition from all the other luxury brands rushing to capitalize on luxo-SUV demand, from Lamborghini’s Urus to Bentley’s Bentayga. Not to mention the electric SUVs unveiled around the Geneva Show, like Jaguar’s I-Pace and a surprise Mission E Cross Turismo concept from Porsche, which looks like a jacked-up version of the sexy Mission E sedan. Or is it a four-door grand tourer coupe? Whatever they’re called, sporty SUVs are ever-more popular at all ends of the price range. (Toyota's Rav4 SUV recently unseated the Camry as the country's best-selling car.) Don’t be surprised if other manufacturers copy Range Rover’s lead and start leaving doors off to try to capture the coupe buyers as well as the previously-sedan fans.

Rhett Allain,"This question is probably as old as the airplane itself. It goes something like this: An airplane has a takeoff speed of 100 mph (I just made that number up). What if it gets on a super giant treadmill that moves backwards at 100 mph. Could a plane on this giant treadmill take off or would it just sit there moving at 0 mph? The first question a reasonable person would ask is ""Where do you get a giant plane-sized treadmill that goes 100 mph?"" Yes, that is indeed a good question—but I won't answer it. Instead, I'm going to give this question the best physics answer I can. Before I do that, I should point out that others have also answered this question (not surprising since it's super old anyway). First, there is the MythBusters episode from 2008. Actually, they didn't answer the question—they did the question. The MythBusters made a giant conveyer belt with a plane on it. It was awesome. Second, there is the xkcd answer to this question (also from 2008). Now you get my answer. I will answer with different examples. A Car on a Conveyer Belt This isn't so difficult. What if I put a car going 100 mph on a conveyer belt that is also going 100 mph? It would look like this (something like this): Really, there is probably no surprise here. The car's wheels would roll at 100 mph as the treadmill (or conveyer belt) moves back at 100 mph so that the car remains stationary. Actually, here is a slightly cooler example (with the same physics). Here is an experiment (also from the MythBusters) in which they shot a ball at 60 mph out the back of a truck also going 60 mph. You can see that the ball remains stationary (with respect to the ground). Super Short Takeoff Here is a plane from Alaska that takes off in a very short distance. How does this work? I'll give you a hint—there is a very strong wind blowing into the front of the plane. Without a headwind, this wouldn't happen. But if you think about it, this short take off is very much like the car on the treadmill. For a plane, it doesn't drive on the ground, it ""drives"" in the air. If the plane has a takeoff speed of 40 mph and is in a 40 mph headwind, it doesn't even need to move at all with respect to the ground. Plane on a Conveyer Belt Now let's do it. Here is a short clip from the MythBusters launching a plane on a moving treadmill. Yes, it takes off. A plane can take off from a runway moving in the opposite direction? But why? It's because the wheels on a plane don't really do anything. The only function for the wheels is to produce low friction between the aircraft and the ground. They don't even push the plane forward—that is done by the propeller. The only difference when launching a plane on a moving runway is that the wheels will spin at twice the normal speed—but that shouldn't matter. So the plane on a treadmill works, but how about a case where the plane wouldn't take off? What if the plane was more like a glider with motorized wheels? On a normal runway, these motorized wheels would increase the speed of the glider until it reached takeoff speed. But if you put this on a moving runway, the wheels would spin at the right speed and cancel the motion of the treadmill so that the plane would remain motionless and never reach the proper speed for a launch. OK, so that is the answer to everyone's favorite question. But don't worry, this answer won't stop the endless discussion—that will live on forever.",Where do you get a giant plane-sized treadmill that goes 100 mph? Good question.

Megan Rose Dickey,"Scoot, the electric moped company that first launched in San Francisco, is deploying two new modes of transportation in Barcelona. The first is an upgrade of its original scooter that the company deploys in San Francisco. Instead of maxing out at 30 mph, this new moped can go up to 60 mph. The second mode of transportation is a good old-fashioned pedal assist bicycle. To support Scoot’s ambitions in Barcelona, the company has a team of 20 people based in the European city. Specifically, Scoot will deploy 1,000 bicycles that can lock to bike locks and other city infrastructure. Scoot will also deploy 500 electric scooters, designed by Silence. These mopeds are designed to not only drive faster, but also be more durable and carry up to two people. But Scoot won’t be the only shared electric moped and bicycle service in Barcelona. Instead, it will join the likes of moped startups Yugo and eCooltra, and bike-share startup Bicing. Scoot is hoping to also launch its stationless bikes in San Francisco, but can’t for a little while due to the fact the city has an exclusive permit with bike-share service JUMP (now owned by Uber) until next June. However, Scoot founder and CEO Michael Keating told me he’s hopeful the city will change it’s mind, saying, “we would like to think we’d be able to convince the city to let us do it before the JUMP pilot ends.” Scoot CEO Michael Keating at the company’s SF HQ That’s because Scoot has been working with the city since 2012, and has, in Keating’s mind, proven its ability to work well with cities. Scoot was quite early to the concept of shared mobility that you can leave and pickup anywhere. Fast forward a few years and now we see Lime, Bird, Spin and JUMP hitting the streets with electric scooters and bikes. Despite the entrance of several new mobility players in San Francisco, Keating said Scoot hasn’t seen any dips in ridership. Whether Scoot gets into stand-on scooters remains to be seen. Keating said he recognizes they’re a “cool product” but he has an issue with how often people ride them on sidewalks. You may also remember when Scoot launched ten of those mini electric cars that could hold up to two people. Scoot has since pulled them from the streets, but Keating said the company is currently looking for the right electric car for San Francisco.","Scoot, the electric moped company that first launched in San Francisco, is deploying two new modes of transportation in Barcelona.

Jack Stewart,"I’m 40 feet from the Jaguar, mint chocolate chip ice cream dripping down the cone onto my fingers, when I hear the purring from under the hood. Strange, I think. First off, the car is parked. Second, it doesn’t have an engine. It’s only after a moment that I realize the sound is the car defending itself against the brutality of a summer day in Southern California’s Coachella Valley. The fast charger I’ve plugged into the car is ramming in electrons, heating up the battery pack. Add 100-degree weather on top of that, and you see why the fan is running full pelt. It’s making sure the I-Pace, Jaguar’s first all-electric car and a serious challenger to Tesla’s EV dominance, remains a cool cat. After wiping the remnants of my own heat-defense mechanism off my hands, I disconnect the charger, note how long the car’s been plugged in and how much power I’ve added, and climb inside the small SUV. I press the chromed start button and watch the screens in the middle of the dash and behind the steering wheel spring into life with a cat motif. Then—at the point when a conventional car gets loud—the I-Pace quiets down. I pull out of the mall parking lot and onto the freeway in silence. Near silence, anyway. When I put my foot down, I can’t suppress a giggle as the I-Pace rushes up the freeway on-ramp. I’m halfway through a road trip from LA to Palm Springs in this all-new EV, one of the first cars to rival Elon’s Musk-mobiles in terms of range, performance, technology, and luxury. Deliveries in the US start later this year, with a price tag from $69,500. For that, buyers get a car that runs from nought to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds. (That feels especially quick in the small, high-seated vehicle.) The two motors send 394 horsepower and 512 pound-feet of torque to all four wheels. No wonder the automotive press corps has bestowed glowing early reviews on the new Jag. But it was a given this car was going to be quick. All high-end electric cars are, to the point where the specs are getting a touch outrageous: Zero to 60 mph times under two seconds are increasingly common, as are four-digit horsepower figures. “We have a bubble right now between the premium brands, around torque and things,” says Chelsea Sexton, a longtime EV advocate. “It’s a bit of a manhood measuring contest.” As the auto industry moves into the electric age, then, we need new ways to evaluate these vehicles, focusing on factors that are much more useful in everyday life. It might mean relearning a few new terms you’ve forgotten from high school physics, but it’ll make any decision to go all-in on EVs a lot clearer. So while I will allow myself the occasional heavy-footed launch in the I-Pace, I’m going to be looking at how day-to-day drivers will use their electric cars. Not just how far can you go without plugging in, but how fast you can refill the battery. The SUV is a new look for Jaguar. But Americans’ lust for bigger vehicles knows no bounds; Jaguar’s F-Pace SUV quickly became its top-selling car. The roomier model can also handle the space and weight demands of a big battery. “I think charging time is more important than range, frankly,” says Ian Callum, Jaguar’s chief designer and the man who penned the I-Pace. That might be true one day, when superfast chargers are at every highway rest stop. For now, they’re typically few and far between, so range still matters. There’s a 90-kWh battery under the floor of the I-Pace, about what you find in a high-end Tesla, good for around 240 miles. Charging takes 40 minutes from 0 to 80 percent at a 100-kW fast charger, or 85 minutes at a more common 50-kW charger. My round trip to Palm Springs and back is 224 miles, plus some driving around while I’m there, plus blasting the AC in the desert heat. Hence midtrip refill, the ice cream, and note-taking to check the figures. I added 44 kWh in 52 minutes—which cost $10.40 on a 50-kW EVgo charger—taking the battery from 24 percent to 75 percent full. More than enough to get home, and in line with Jaguar’s claims. Any electric car beats any gas car when it comes to efficiency, but some EVs give a harder score smackdown than others. My total energy consumption for the trip, as recorded by the I-Pace’s computer, was 41.6 kWh per 100 miles. (This is another metric manufacturers have yet to standardize, but a potential substitute for the soon-to-be-defunct miles per gallon.) In Tesla’s Model 3, I clocked just 26 kWh per 100 miles on a similar route. The difference matters: It means the Tesla can squeeze 310 miles out of a smaller, lighter, and cheaper 75-kWh battery. For the cross-shoppers, the downmarket Hyundai Kona gets 258 miles out of 64 kWh. The Chevrolet Bolt gets 238 miles out of 60 kWh. Bigger, taller cars like the I-Pace have to spend more energy punching through the air than their smaller, svelter counterparts, so they consume more electricity. But where a Range Rover can carry a 27-gallon fuel tank and run for hours between (more expensive) gas station stops, Callum’s team could only make a battery so big without trade-offs in weight and space. So they turned to other tricks to keep the range up. “The biggest influence I have is the aerodynamics of the car, which we take very seriously,” Callum says. Thus the large hood scoop, which funnels air from the front grille and shapes how it flows over the car. The spoiler over the rear window keeps the air attached to the vehicle. The tall, squared-off back end limits turbulence, which invites drag. The door handles retract so they’re flush with the sides. “It is what it is for good reason,” Callum adds. “It’s the result of logical integration of package and engineering.” It happens to look nice too. The SUV is a relatively new look for Jaguar, long a sedan and coupe shop. But Americans’ lust for these bigger vehicles knows no bounds; Jaguar’s F-Pace SUV quickly became its top-selling car. In addition, the roomier model can handle the space and weight demands of a big battery. Callum says that there’s room for a small, efficient, electric car in Jaguar’s future, which will help diversify the range and give the company a product for all EV buyers: luxury seekers and eco-warriors, mall rats and backroad explorers. Yet he also pointed out that technology will eventually, roughly, even out among all automakers. Range and charging rate matter, but only so much. Car purchases are emotional decisions. Along with Jaguar, more rivals for Tesla are coming, including models from Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and others. The EV field will soon be stuffed with competent cars, which consumers will learn to evaluate on their own new terms. An I-Pace buyer will choose the vehicle because the neighbors already have a Tesla, or it looks good, or it drives great, as long as it meets her basic needs. Callum doesn’t see that changing: “We’ll still be about performance, agility, and driving.” Back in Los Angeles, I pull off the freeway and into my garage, with 25 percent of battery remaining, and plug it in. (The whole plugging and unplugging thing is going to have to become routine, just like with smartphones.) For people who can afford it, this is not just a great electric car, but a great car, full stop. And I can’t wait to get back onto the freeway ramp, where I’ve got the room to stomp the pedal.

Jack Stewart,"For more than a century, automakers have been racing to craft ever better machines. They've evolved from carving wood to stamping steel to pressing aluminum to forging carbon fiber. They've played with virtual reality and 3-D printing, always looking for the edge that lets them outbuild the competition. And now, despite the efforts of thousands of engineers, over millions of man hours and billions of dollars, they have all been wiped into oblivion. By Lego. Because who will even bother to compete with a Bugatti Chiron made of the colorful kids blocks? Nobody. Not when the vehicle in question is full-sized, seats two adult humans, and really truly drives. OK, so the specs don't exactly match the original. Where the real Chiron produces 1,500 horsepower from a quad-turbocharged W16 engine and can hit 261 mph, the Lego lookalike makes 5.3 horses from 2,304 tiny motors, can go 18 mph—surely the slowest any vehicle has driven at Germany's Ehra Lessien proving ground. But the resemblance is uncanny. From a distance, the Lego car looks real, with a two-tone blue paint job, horseshoe grille, and scooped flanks. “If you stand 10 meters back, you really wouldn’t manage to tell the difference,"" says Andy Wallace, the Bugatti development driver who took this model for a spin. ""Seriously."" A closer look reveals the differences, but also the stunning dedication to detail. The interconnected triangular segments that make up the skin of the car are shaped to replicate the organic lines of the original. Custom transparent Technic pieces make for functional headlights. The team even made a Lego electric screwdriver to put it all together—a real one has too much torque and would have damaged pieces. The functional rear spoiler raises and lowers using Lego Technic pneumatic actuators, though creating downforce isn't much of a concern in a vehicle that would lose a drag race to a golf cart. The interior makes you think of a busted, pixelated, HD TV: It’s all the right colors in the right places, but with jagged edges. Even the rounded steering wheel is built from rectangular blocks. The gear shifter and steering wheel-mounted paddles are present but decorative—there are no gears to be changed. And there's no accelerator pedal; the brake controls forward motion. The speedometer does work, and is marked out to an optimistic 60 km/h (that's 37 mph). Quick reminder: All of these parts are built from Lego blocks. Lego says this is the first time it has built a fully functional, self-propelled, life-sized car, and that this is its most complex non-glued Technic model. The team at the company's Klando factory in the Czech Republic started this labor of love (and probably frustration) in June 2017. They did have to rely on a few conventional building techniques, including a steel frame to support the 3,300-pound finished model and provide a solid connection point for the original Chiron wheels. If you're desperate to drive a Chiron, don't have a few million dollars to drop on the ""real"" version, and think a handful of horsepower is plenty, then this is the ride for you. You'll just have to convince Lego to make you one.

Sean O'Kane,"The company behind Project Bloodhound, a UK-based initiative to break 1,000 miles per hour in a rocket-powered car, is in dire straits. The Bloodhound Supersonic Car is all but built, and it reached speeds of over 200 mph in a test last year. But the company says it needs to raise £25 million (just shy of $33 million) or it will go broke. Bloodhound Programme Ltd announced on Monday that it has entered into administration, which, like bankruptcy, is a process where control of the company gets passed to an “administrator” whose goal is to repay creditors as quickly as possible. The business advisory firm that was hired (FRP Advisory LLP) says it has started talking to potential investors, according to the BBC. Until now, the project was funded mostly through sponsorships and individual donors. Described by the company as a combination of a fast jet, an F1 racer, and a spaceship, the Bloodhound car is a sight to behold. The dragster-style car measures 13.5 meters (44 feet) in length and weighs 7.5 tons. Its ultimate 135,000-brake horsepower will be generated by two sources of power: a Rolls-Royce Eurofighter jet engine and a cluster of rockets from Norwegian aerospace company Nammo. The rockets haven’t been integrated yet, but when they are, the car should become capable of hitting 1,000 mph in under one minute, at a pace of about one mile every 3.6 seconds. At full speed, the car should cover one mile every 3.6 seconds Bloodhound first unveiled the car in 2015 and completed a public test in 2017 where it reached speeds of 210 mph on back-to-back runs at the Newquay Airport in southwest England. Eventually, the goal is to not only break the land speed record of 763 mph, but to set a new world record of 1,000 mph. The pilot is Andy Green, who set the current land speed record in 1997 with a similar jet-powered car. The Bloodhound project is also directed by Richard Noble, one of the leaders of the 1997 record-setting attempt. The Bloodhound team originally wanted to make the 1,000 mph attempt in 2020. The track in South Africa is ready for the car, too. Built by the Northern Cape Provincial Government, the 1,500-meter-wide track stretches 18 kilometers (just over 11 miles) across a section of the Kalahari Desert known as the Hakskeen Pan. According to Mark Chapman, the team’s chief engineer, that timeline could still work if a new source of money is found. “Once we have the funding in place, or at least visibility of that funding, and the team is back in the building, then 10 months later, we’re out in South Africa,” Chapman told the BBC. “We’re that close.”","The Bloodhound project’s supersonic car was supposed to try and break the land speed record of 763 mph in 2020, but it’s already out of money.",2018-10-15T21:36:56Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","Rocket car won’t break 1,000 miles per hour unless company raises $33 million",https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17979948/bloodhound-rocket-car-money-debt-financing-record,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HzjsxmXHoY8nrfvHUotF3FUhZVo=/0x72:1020x606/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4092624/vs09-24_0913cxs.0.png,the-verge,The Verge,mph,1
Sean O'Kane,"With a not-so-dreamy starting price of $69,000 After spending the better part of the last decade operating completely out of the spotlight, US-based automotive startup Rivian has finally debuted its first electric vehicle: a five-passenger pickup truck called the R1T. Announced Monday at the Los Angeles Auto Show, the R1T is positioned as a dream truck for outdoorsy types, combining the utility of a Ford Ranger or Toyota Tacoma with bleeding edge technology — all while putting out zero emissions, meaning owners can help reduce the harm being done to the natural world the company’s vehicles are meant to explore. A big part of Rivian’s long, meticulous road to this debut has been all about making sure the R1T (and a sibling SUV scheduled to be revealed on Tuesday) offer top of the line specs when it comes to performance and range. The result is a quad-motor electric pickup truck capable of up to over 400 miles of range and able to reach 60 miles per hour in three seconds, putting Rivian’s first offering in rare air typically reserved for Teslas and supercars. In accordance with all that, the R1T will be outfitted with a dream car price tag when it goes on sale in 2020. The base model starts at $69,000, with different battery configurations running the truck’s price ceiling to around $100,000. Preorders start this week, and require a (refundable) $1,000 deposit. The R1T will be available in three different battery pack variants, though all will feature an electric motor on each wheel, offering precise all-wheel drive performance no matter how much power is available. The biggest version of the truck will have a 180kWh battery that will allow more than 400 miles of range, according to Rivian. (That’s 80 kWh more than the highest-capacity car Tesla currently sells.) A 135kWh version of the R1T will eclipse 300 miles. The smallest — equipped with a 105kWh pack that will give the truck about 230 miles of range — will be available “within six months” following the launch of the others. All three versions of the truck have a top speed of 125 miles per hour. The mid-range battery pack version is the quickest, according to Rivian, hitting 60 miles per hour in 3 seconds flat thanks to a total power output of 562kW (about 750 horsepower). The 400-mile battery version of the truck sends 522kW (about 700 horsepower) to the gearbox and will hit the 60 mph mark in 3.2 seconds. The cheaper short-range version will go from 0 to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds, with 300kW of power (about 400 horsepower) on offer. The R1T is a little bit longer and taller than the new Ford Ranger or Toyota Tacoma Dimension-wise, the R1T is most directly comparable to the new Ford Ranger or the newest Toyota Tacoma, though there are differences. Rivian’s electric pickup has a slightly longer wheelbase (135.8 inches) than the Ranger (127 inches) or the Tacoma (127.4 inches). At 226 inches overall, it is longer than the Ranger (210.8 inches) and the Tacoma (212.3 inches). Rivian’s truck is a smidge taller than both, too, measuring 71.5 inches to the Ranger’s 70.7 inch height, or the Tacoma’s 70.6-inch stance. The R1T is not quite as wide as the Ranger, with Rivian’s truck measuring 79.3 inches compared to the Ranger’s width of 85.8 inches. (The base model of the Tacoma measures 74.4 inches wide). The R1T has a payload of about 1,760 pounds, which is shy of the Ranger’s 2,080 pound capacity, but far exceeds the Tacoma’s 1,175 pound limit. The Ford Ranger and the Toyota Tacoma start at around $25,000, so they easily beat the R1T on price. But Rivian promises the R1T will deliver more than what you’d find in a conventional pickup truck of this size. The amount of lockable storage is a key feature of the R1T For one thing, the R1T has a towing capacity of 11,000 pounds, which is more comparable to the capability of a higher-end F-150. There’s also a bounty of storage space in the R1T thanks to the fact that the battery and electric drivetrain are all located on the floor of the vehicle. The front trunk offers 11.7 cubic feet (330 liters) of storage space, and there’s a 12.4 cubic foot (350-liter) “gear tunnel” that sits between the cab and the bed and runs the entire width of the vehicle, which Rivian says is ideal for things like skis, or golf bags, or fishing rods, or even lumber. And there’s a storage compartment in the floor of the bed that’s big enough for a spare tire. Rivian has packed its first vehicle with loads of technology, too. A 15.6-inch touchscreen display dominates the middle of the dashboard, echoing the screen-first approach of Tesla’s Model 3. Another 12.3-inch screen takes the place of what are, historically, physical dials in the instrument cluster behind the steering wheel. A third 6.8-inch touchscreen is found at the back of the center console, providing infotainment and climate control access to rear passengers. Some of the only buttons to be found are the thumb dials on the steering wheel, another echo of the Model 3. Meanwhile, three 110-volt power outlets can be found in the pickup’s bed, allowing owners to use the truck’s big battery to charge devices or power tools on the go. There’s a built-in compressed air source for filling bike tires. And Rivian has built in some clever security measures, too. Cables in the bed, which help strap down gear, are linked into the truck’s digital architecture in such a way that will alert the owner if they’re tampered with. Cameras watching the bed can also alert an owner to potential thefts. Being an electric vehicle made in the late 2010s, the truck is unsurprisingly equipped with hardware that Rivian says will allow it to one day drive itself. That includes those cameras, as well as lidar, radar, ultrasonic, and “high-precision” GPS technologies, according to Rivian. This tech will allow for “eyes off, hands off” driving on the highway, the company says, and one day will make it possible for the truck to do more impressive things in the future, like meet a driver at the end of a hiking trail or river run. Rivian is explicitly targeting adventurers with its first truck, an approach that will extend to the SUV that is also being announced this week, as well as future products. “They may have different form factors, they may be different sizes, but every single one of [our products] has to have this Patagonia-like feel of enabling adventure,” Rivian CEO and founder RJ Scaringe tells The Verge. “We want to keep that very sharp. We want to focus only on the adventure space, so customers understand what we stand for.” “It’s really important for us that the vehicle feels comfortable getting dirty.” That doesn’t necessarily mean you have to regularly kayak white-water rapids to enjoy the R1T, Scaringe says. Instead, he’s trying to imbue the brand with an aspirational quality from the get go. That materializes in the storage and other utility features, but also in the truck’s design. “From a design point of view it’s really important for us that the vehicle feels comfortable getting dirty and looks robust and rugged, but at the same time is sophisticated and intelligent,” Scaringe says. “[We’re] combining an aesthetic that communicates a level of technology, a level of refinement, a level of sophistication, while still being something that still looks natural going through the woods, going on the beach, going over some pretty gnarly trails.” A number of EV startups have spent the last decade trying to follow in Tesla’s wake, but almost none of them have succeeded in putting a car on the road. Faraday Future garnered a ton of attention and soaked up a lot of talent and funding, only to find itself on the brink of bankruptcy for the second year in a row. Fisker, LeEco, and others have faced similar struggles. Lucid Motors was nearly out of money before recently securing enough funding from Saudi Arabia to launch its first electric luxury sedan in 2020. One of the only high-profile startups to put a car on the road is China’s NIO. Rivian took a much slower and steadier route than other EV startups That’s a pretty bad track record considering many of these high-profile startups haven’t made it to the hardest part: production. Rivian will have to face that same challenge soon enough. But the company’s slow, steady, and quiet approach means the attention (and the pressure to produce) is arriving well after the foundation is in place. Rivian has a manufacturing facility secured and ready to go in Illinois. It has 600 employees working across two locations in California, one in Michigan, and one in the UK. It also has come out laser-focused on a niche — though Tesla is planning an electric pickup, which Elon Musk says he’s “personally most excited about” compared to the company’s other planned offerings. “We were quiet in stealth mode to avoid getting caught in this sort of hype cycle, and we said let’s make sure we have all the pieces lined up — the vehicle, the technology, the team, the supply chain, the manufacturing plant — before we actually talk about it,” Scaringe says. “Because of that, some people have been questioning [us]. People need to see that this is very, very real.” On a more personal level, Scaringe says he’s relieved to finally shed some light on all the things that Rivian’s been up to. “Basically the majority of my adult life has been focused on this, and we finally get to show it,” he says. “I’m excited.”","The new electric pickup truck, coming in 2020, has up to 400 miles of range and can go from 0 to 60 mph in just 3 seconds.

Patrick Allan,"Every year, around 1,200 tornadoes hit the United States, destroying everything in their path. They can form almost anywhere, in any season, and bring with them 300 mph winds and funnels that can be more than a mile wide. This is what you need to know to survive one of Mother Nature’s most brutal offspring. You see those green, billowing storm clouds over there? Those are bad. Not because you’ll get… Read more Read Where and When They Occur Most tornadoes in the U.S. occur east of the Rocky Mountains. They are especially concentrated in the central and southern plains (what’s commonly known as “ Tornado Alley ”), as well as the Gulf Coast and parts of Florida. That said, tornadoes can occur just about anywhere, so it’s good to be prepared for them wherever you live. Once they form, tornadoes tend to move southwest to northeast, but they have been known to change direction. While tornadoes can occur any time during the year, they’re most likely to strike in the spring and summer months. More often than not, they happen in the late afternoon and early evening when the pressure is rapidly changing, usually between 3 and 9 p.m. Know the Warning Signs Tornadoes can strike quickly and seemingly out of nowhere, but there are usually warning signs of some kind. Make sure you know what different weather warnings mean : Severe thunderstorm watch : Weather conditions suggest severe thunderstorms may develop in your area. Severe thunderstorms are an early warning sign of a potential tornado. Severe thunderstorm warning : A severe thunderstorm has been observed by spotters or indicated on radar, and is occuring in your area. These storms can produce rain, lightning, hail, and wind of at least 58 mph. These warnings last for around an hour, or until the storm passes or upgrades to something more severe. Tornado watch : Weather conditions suggest severe thunderstorms are likely and may develop into tornadoes in your area. If you see this warning, review your emergency plans and start preparing for the worst. Tornado warning : It’s happening right now! A tornado has been spotted or indicated on radar in your area, so engage in your emergency plan or take cover immediately. It’s National Preparedness Month, which means it’s time to make sure you’re ready for whatever life … Read more Read If you’re not near your phone, or in an area with poor coverage, there are other tornado signs. Look and listen for : Dark, greenish thunderstorm clouds Dark, low-lying clouds (especially if rotating) Large hail or heavy rain Whirling dust or debris on the ground (tornadoes don’t always have a funnel) Loud, continuous roar that sounds like thunder or a freight train (but never fades away) Knowing these warning signs can save you a ton of time, and time is of the essence in emergency situations. When the Tornado Strikes Once a warning has been issued, or you can see the storm approaching yourself, it’s time to seek shelter immediately. Do not hesitate! Keep in mind, wherever you end up, be sure to protect your head. Most tornado injuries involve flying debris. And never leave a building in an attempt to escape a tornado. You can’t outrun it. If you’re at home Go inside and move to a small interior, windowless room. The lower the room, the better. If you have a basement or cellar, go there. Stay away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. The idea is to put as many walls between you and the outside as possible. Once you’re in a safe room, get under a sturdy table or desk, cover your head and neck with your arms, a heavy coat, a thick blanket, or pillows to protect from debris. If you live in a manufactured or mobile home, leave immediately and head to the closest sturdy building. Mobile homes offer very little protection. Keep pets on a leash or in a crate or carrier. If you’re at work or school Head to a pre-designated safe area, like a safe room, storm cellar, or a windowless interior room. If you are in a high-rise building, head to a small interior room on the lowest floor possible. If possible, avoid any buildings with long-spanning roof areas, like gymnasiums, arenas, or shopping malls. These buildings have a high chance of collapsing from pressure during tornadoes. Follow the instructions of your office safety officer or teacher. Remember when you bought a new can opener because you thought you lost your old one? What do you… Read more Read If you’re in a hotel or airport Hotels may have a basement or other designated safe area. Follow the instructions of hotel staff. Otherwise, seek shelter in interior bathrooms or closets near the center of the building. Protect yourself with pillows, blankets, and mattresses. Be sure to inform management of any injuries or damaged property when it’s all over. If you’re in a concourse or terminal of an airport during a tornado warning, airport staff should guide you to a safe area (often designated tornado shelters). You may be advised to leave your luggage behind, so do as instructed. If you’re in your car or truck Do not try to outrun a tornado—it’s faster than you and doesn’t have to stick to roads. Instead, safely drive to the nearest sturdy-looking building. Once there, park your car outside of any traffic lanes and get inside. If you’re caught inside your vehicle : park, make sure your seat belt is on, put your head down below the windows, and cover your head and neck with a coat, blanket, seat cushion, or your hands. The vehicle’s airbags and frame will offer some protection. Never seek shelter under a bridge or overpass. You’re safer in a low, flat, open location. If you’re outside If reaching shelter in time is not possible, you have a couple of options. If you can get next to a building, do so and crouch next to a strong wall. If you’re totally out in the open, get away from trees, cars, and other potentially deadly debris, then lie face down, flat in a ditch or other low-lying area. Cover your head and neck with whatever you have. After the Tornado If you’re trapped by debris, FEMA recommends you don’t try to move, kick up dust, or push your way out. You may be injured and could make things worse for yourself. Instead, tap on a pipe, wall, or other material that makes a sound. Whistle or yell if you can so rescuers can locate you. When the storm has passed, check in with your family and friends to make sure nobody is hurt. Keep them together during the aftermath. Switch on your radio and listen for instructions from local officials and emergency personnel. Use extreme caution as you begin to clean up. Stay away from debris, damaged buildings, and downed power lines, and watch for broken glass and other sharp objects on the ground. Be sure to wear protective clothing while you handle debris, and don’t try to lift heavy debris by yourself. If your power is out, use flashlights and lamps—not matches, lighters, or candles. You don’t want to have to add a fire onto your insurance claim.","Every year, around 1,200 tornadoes hit the United States, destroying everything in their path.

Rhett Allain,"During Sunday's NFL game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Philadelphia Eagles, Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson makes a pretty nice move. After taking the ball and running with it, he makes a quick pitch off to the side while faking out the defender. Looks pretty cool, but it probably wasn't legal. In the NFL, you can only toss the ball backwards once you cross the line of scrimmage. This should have been a penalty for an illegal forward pass, but it looks like he got away with it. https://twitter.com/NFL/status/937533538013868032 But was it really a forward pass? Yes. It's not so easy to tell if you watch this in real time, but going frame by frame it's much clearer. Wilson tosses the ball when he is at the 46 and a half yard line. The running back (Mike Davis) catches it at 47.5 yard line. That's a pass that goes 1 yard forward—so a forward pass. Just to further drive home the point, I can use my favorite video analysis techniques (using Tracker Video Analysis ) to get the position of both Wilson and the ball as he runs down the field. Check this out. In this plot, the red data shows the position of Russell Wilson in the direction of the field (x-direction) and the blue data is the position of the ball. Just for fun, I can also fit a linear function to the data (for straight parts) to get the velocity in that direction. During the toss, Wilson is running at 4.55 m/s (10.2 mph) while the ball has an x-velocity of 1.27 m/s. But since both the ball has a positive x-velocity, it is indeed a forward pass. Illegal. It's OK if you thought it was a backwards pass. It's also OK if Russell Wilson thought it was a backwards pass—because in the reference frame of the quarterback, it is a backwards pass. Let me give a simple analogy. Suppose you are in a car driving 30 mph along a road. While it's driving, you take a football and throw it backwards from car with a speed of 10 mph. From your viewpoint (in the car moving 30 mph), it looks like the ball is traveling in the backwards direction at 10 mph. However, if you were on the ground (and stationary) looking at the car, the ball would still be moving forward with a speed of 20 mph (30 mph - 10 mph = 20 mph). This is exactly what's going on here. We (as humans) tend to view the ball with respect to the moving thrower. On top of this, the camera pans with the motion of the runner. This also encourages us to view from the reference frame of the runner. So, in a sense we are tricked into thinking it's a backwards pass. Maybe this will help. Here is an animation with a stationary world view such is how it would appear if the camera didn't move. From this view, it's much clearer that the ball moves forward. Velocity is always relative to your frame of reference. But of course, it's only a penalty if the referees decide to flag it.","Frame-by-frame video analysis shows an illegal forward pass—but in the reference frame of the QB, it's backwards.",2017-12-04T21:45:58Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Eagles vs. Seahawks: Why Russell Wilson's Forward Pass Looks Backwards,https://www.wired.com/story/eagles-vs-seahawks-analysis-why-russell-wilsons-forward-pass-looks-backwards/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a25b8f1e5da64557a973f2f/191:100/pass/russel-wilson-FA.jpg,wired,Wired,mph,1

Mariella Moon,"According to Space News, Stratolaunch has to reach taxi speeds up to 80 mph and then 138 mph during its next tests -- to note, typical jetliners have to go as fast as 150 to 180 mph to take off. Stratolaunch passed its previous tests without needing any modification, so the company is optimistic that it'll be able to fly for the first time this year. Stratolaunch was designed to be able to carry launch vehicles and their payloads, such as satellites, strapped to its belly. It'll fly them high enough and release them mid-flight, serving as a reusable, affordable way to ferry satellites to orbit. The company is even looking at the possibility of flying three rockets on a single trip, but before the happens, it'll have to nail that test flight in the coming months.

Keith Wagstaff,"A bunch of lucky passengers may have made aviation history this week on a Norwegian Air Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight from New York to London. The plane rode tailwinds of more than 200 mph on Jan. 15, allowing it to make the trip in just 5 hours and 13 minutes. According to Norwegian Air, that's the fastest transatlantic trip ever for a subsonic commercial aircraft. SEE ALSO: Planes flew from New York to London at near-supersonic speeds due to powerhouse jet stream Those tailwinds — which hit 202 mph, according to Norwegian — propelled the plane to a top speed of 776 mph relative to the ground, also known as its groundspeed. The Dreamliner is the fuel-efficient plane Boeing unveiled in 2007. It boasts more leg room and larger windows than your average commercial jetliner, smart LED lighting, and the use of lightweight composite materials. Computer model simulation of jet stream winds on Monday, Jan. 15, 2018, when the flight record was set. The winds are blowing from west to east. Image: Tropical Tidbits The jet stream that helped propel the plane is the fast-moving current of air at upper levels of the atmosphere that plays a key role in separating air masses and spawning storms. It reaches its fastest speeds during the winter in the northern hemisphere, when temperature contrast between the equator and the North Pole is at its maximum. On Monday, Norwegian flight DY7014 left New York City's JFK airport at 11:44 a.m. and arrived at London Gatwick at 9:57 p.m. local time — saving the 284 passengers on the flight 53 minutes off their scheduled flying time. The previous subsonic transatlantic flight record was 5 hours and 16 minutes, which was set in 2015. That's nothing compared to the Concorde, the supersonic passenger jet that once flew from New York to London in just 2 hours, 52 minutes and 59 seconds, according to British Airways. Sadly, it made its last commercial flight in 2003. And then there's the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. In 1974, the now-retired military spy plane made the trip in 1 hour, 54 minutes, and 56.4 seconds. Of course, the Dreamliner is probably a little more comfortable than the Blackbird. Hopefully those passengers were able to get in a pint or two with their extra hour in London.

"Raphael Orlove on Jalopnik, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The Tesla Roadster, unexpectedly, is back. The specs that Tesla are claiming verge on the unbelievable. Top speed of 250+ MPH. 0-60 in 1.9 seconds. Range of 620 miles. To give you an idea of how nuts that is, no production car has gone faster to highway speed. Ever. No Ferrari, no Porsche, not even a Koenigsegg. And that top speed is unreal, too. Never have I felt like Tesla has been veering as close to Vector territory as the company is now. Other cars can top 250, sure, but they’re all powered by gasoline. But hey, other electric vehicles have already whipped into the 230s recently with bigger bodies, so it’s not unthinkable. And the range, given the size of that 200kWh battery pack, also stretches but does not break belief. Tesla just put out the pricing of the car on its new official webpage, with a starting base price of $200,000 and a starting reservation of $50,000. Tesla lists this car as a four-seater with all-wheel drive, making it a rare bird in the automotive world. Not a lot of four-seat, removable top, AWD cars out there.

Megan Rose Dickey,"Because there are not enough ways to get around major cities and campuses, Spin is working to launch stationless electric scooter-sharing. These aren’t the electric scooters you see in San Francisco, operated by Scoot Networks. These are essentially electrified Razor-like scooters that can go up to 15 mph and cover 18 miles on a single charge. “Spin’s mission is to transform cities and campuses with smart mobility solutions,” Spin co- founder and President Euwyn Poon said in a statement. “We believe in multiple modes of last-mile transportation and the electric scooter is a fast, fun option for short distances. The introduction of the electric scooter marks the transition of Spin into a true multi-modal mobility platform for cities and campuses.” In order to deter theft, Spin’s scooters require riders to unlock the wheels with the app. There is also a built-in GPS on each scooter. Last August, Spin brought its stationless bike-share program to South San Francisco after launching in Seattle earlier that year. Then, just last month, Spin unveiled its stationless electric bike. Although the company is based in San Francisco, it’s going to be a little while until it can launch its stationless bike-share in the city. That’s because the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency granted an exclusive 18-month pilot to JUMP for stationless bike-sharing. It’s not clear if the SFMTA’s permit with JUMP prevents other companies from launching other types of stationless transportation sharing services. I’ve reached out to the SFTMA and will update this when I hear back. During a demo of the scooter, Poon told me the company is in early talks with the SFMTA and expects its stationless scooters to receive a permit “soon.” Unlike Spin’s bikes, which you can rent for $1 for 30 minutes, the scooters will be a bit more expensive to rent, costing $1 to unlock and then 15 cents per minute. Spin’s plan is to first launch these scooters in some of its existing markets, which include Seattle, Washington D.C. and Dallas.

Devin Coldewey,"Last night’s 10 minutes of terror as the InSight Mars Lander descended to the Martian surface at 12,300 MPH were a nail-biter for sure, but now the robotic science platform is safe and sound and has sent pics back to prove it. The first thing it sent was a couple pictures of its surroundings: Elysium Planitia, a rather boring-looking, featureless plane that is nevertheless perfect for InSight’s drilling and seismic activity work. The images, taken with its Instrument Context Camera, are hardly exciting on their own merits a dirty landscape viewed through a dusty tube. But when you consider that it’s of an unexplored territory on a distant planet, and that it’s Martian dust and rubble occluding the lens, it suddenly seems pretty amazing! Decelerating from interplanetary velocity and making a perfect landing was definitely the hard part, but it was by no means InSight’s last challenge. After touching down, it still needs to set itself up and make sure that none of its many components and instruments were damaged during the long flight and short descent to Mars. And the first good news arrived shortly after landing, relayed via NASA’s Odyssey spacecraft in orbit: a partial selfie showing that it was intact and ready to roll. The image shows, among other things, the large mobile arm folded up on top of the lander, and a big copper dome covering some other components. Telemetry data sent around the same time show that InSight has also successfully deployed its solar panels and its collecting power with which to continue operating. These fragile fans are crucial to the lander, of course, and it’s a great relief to hear they’re working properly. These are just the first of many images the lander will send, though unlike Curiosity and the other rovers, it won’t be traveling around taking snapshots of everything it sees. Its data will be collected from deep inside the planet, offering us insight into the planet’s and our solar system’s origins.","Last night’s 10 minutes of terror as the InSight Mars Lander descended to the Martian surface at 12,300 MPH were a nail-biter for sure, but now the robotic science platform is safe and sound — and has sent pics back to prove it.

Mark Kaufman,"In the year 2044, our cities might be energized by fusion power plants, our sleek cars may all run on electricity, and our doctors might regularly employ gene-editing to cure blindness. 
But our airplanes will probably still fly at the same speeds they did half a century ago: between 550 and 600 mph. 
Supersonic flight  which is to say speeds that exceed the speed of sound (768 mph) and can dramatically slash flight times died out for civilians in 2003 with the retirement of the narrowly-shaped Concorde planes, which for 27 years cruised at 1,300 mph between the U.S. and Europe. ""It failed,"" Bob van der Linden, the Chairman of the Aeronautics Department of the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum, said in an interview. ""It was a technological marvel, but it was too expensive to operate."" 
Although a few ambitious supersonic startups like Boom Technology and Aerion Supersonic might successfully resurrect smaller business-style jets in the coming decades, commercial flying for the masses is unlikely to change much in the next quarter century, and beyond. Today's traditional aviation paradigm works, it's profitable, and it's safe. 
""Since the 1960s, the top speed of an airliner has not changed,"" said van der Linden  and, he adds, he doesn't see any reason that it will. 
""In 20 to 25 years, air travel might not look a whole lot different from how it looks today,"" Dan Bubb, a former pilot and now aviation historian at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, agreed over email.
""I dont think we expect to see any disruptive technologies,"" added Fotis Kopsaftopoulos, an assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in an interview.

These future aircraft will likely look the same as they do now, too. 
""Theres not too much room to change the shape we need wings and a round fuselage,"" Ryo Amano, a professor of mechanical engineering specializing in aerodynamics at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said in an interview. 
But one thing will surely change.
""Youll see airliners becoming more efficient,"" said van der Linden. ""Any breakthrough will be for efficiency's sake.""
This means burning less fuel, resulting in higher airline profits. It's already happening. Some new planes, like the Boeing 787 and the colossal Airbus 380, are built with lighter ""composite materials"" rather than heavier old-school metals, so they burn less fuel. 
An Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger airliner
Image: Lex Rayton/imageBROKER/REX/Shutterstock
""They are lightweight and very strong,"" said Kopsaftopoulos.
New, more efficient engines are burning less fuel, too. 
""You dont really see many of the changes, but inside the engine system there is a tremendous amount of improvement,"" said Amano.
Supersonic dreams
Aviation experts are in wide agreement: Flying at supersonic speeds would slash flight times (imagine a 2.5-hour trip from New York to Los Angeles or London to NYC in under 3.5 hours), and as the Concorde proved, the blazing-fast engines and aerodynamic design technologies do exist. But there are a slew of formidable obstacles. 
Traditional airliners might be slower, but they're moneymakers. In contrast, flying faster burns significantly more fuel. That means pricier flights. 
""A conventional airliner gets better mileage than an SST [supersonic plane],"" said van der Linden. ""Its as simple as that.""
What's more, there was little demand to fly on the 1,300 mph Concorde planes. A seat was just too expensive. ""The cost for one seat probably cost five times more than [a seat on] a 747,"" noted Amano.
A NASA conception of a supersonic plane

""Let's face it, the overwhelming majority of citizens are not millionaires,"" added van der Linden. ""Theres not enough traffic for high-priced stuff.""
But if a supersonic plane did ever take to the skies, it would likely be smaller plane intended for wealthier demographics.
""It would be wonderful to see the return of the Concorde, but if the aircraft returns, it will be a much slimmed-down, more fuel-efficient version,"" said Babb.
A spokesperson for the supersonic startup Boom Technology said they're designing aircraft that ""can operate profitably while charging the same fares as today's business class"" over oceanic routes. For perspective, a round-trip business class ticket between JFK and London generally costs between $3,000 and $8,000.
SEE ALSO: The future of flying is electric planes
Like the auto industry, it's daunting for any startup, like Boom, to break into the aviation world. They don't just need billions of dollars, they have to prove to the vigilant Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that their supersonic planes are profoundly safe. 
""The overwhelming majority of citizens are not millionaires""
""I wish them luck,"" said van der Linden. 
Beyond financial hurdles, supersonics also have to contend with environmental woes. A recent report produced by the International Council on Clean Transportation an organization that provides technical and scientific analysis to environmental regulators  estimated that a worldwide fleet of 2,000 supersonic planes by 2035 would emit prodigious amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.
""The environmental impact of building that many planes would be severe,"" said Dan Rutherford, the ICCT's program director for marine and aviation.
Such supersonic fuel-guzzling creates uncertainty for airlines that might be considering them, as the United Nation's aviation organization will almost certainly tighten emission rules to meet greater society's climate and environmental targets. ""Everyone is wondering what environmental regulations they will need to meet,"" noted Rutherford. 
And supersonic planes have one other mighty, unavoidable hurdle. 
The booms. 
Supersonic booms
Congress outlawed flying supersonic airliners over land in 1970, and for good reason. Sonic booms are thunder-like noises created when planes displace air and create powerful shockwaves, some of which slam into the ground. It's much ""like a boat creates a wake in the water,"" explains NASA. 
The booms jolt buildings, stir people awake, and can feel like a sharp earthquake. ""If youre not expecting them, they can be startling,"" NASA aviation engineer David Richwine told Mashable last year.
This limits supersonic planes to oceanic routes, further reducing their ability to be mainstream airliners. 
A supersonic plane displacing air in the sky
Image: nasa
For this reason, the startup Aerion Supersonic plans to fly over land just under the speed of sound (known as Mach 0.95) ""without a sonic boom,"" said a company spokesperson. But Aerion still has supersonic ambitions, and plans to develop planes that fly at around 920 mph (or 1.2 Mach), wherein the booms will dissipate before pummeling the ground.   
Although overland travel is still illegal for the likes of Boom, Aerion, and others, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may open the door for new supersonic planes to once again fly over land. This won't happen anytime soon (the new supersonic planes don't even exist), but the FAA is considering rules about noise certifications and other rules for supersonic planes once the government settles on what boom levels are tolerable for us land dwellers.
""We have not published any rules as of yet thats still being worked out,"" FAA spokesperson Henry Price said over the phone. 
""The direction were going is in the fact sheet,"" Price added, citing a webpage summarizing the proposed future rules for supersonic planes. 
Likely to the delight of supersonic startups, in 2018 NASA started work on a prototypical supersonic plane, dubbed the X-Plane. The $247.5 million project isn't slated to take off until 2021, but when it does, the 94-foot test craft will soar over American neighborhoods and urban areas. It's an experiment: Are the booms from the innovative design mild enough for citizens to bear? 
A conception of NASA's quiet boom supersonic plane, flying over NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in California
Image: nasa
It's certainly possible that NASA will be successful. There's a big group of aviation experts working on the project, and they have intriguing futuristic ideas, like plane exteriors that subtly morph in the air to tame sonic blasts. If all goes well, NASA's experimental plane will turn sonic booms into muted thumps.
""The work that NASA's doing might help that [sonic booms],"" said van der Linden. ""And a smaller plane might help that.""
""But you can't eliminate it,"" he added.
Even if NASA is successful (it often is), aviation companies seeking to break the sound barrier will have to build planes similar to that low-boom design, airlines will have to order them, and the plane must pass rigid FAA standards.
""Is it going to be worth pursuing by the airlines?"" asked Kopsaftopoulos. ""Im not sure what's going to happen.""
Beyond Speed 
While most passengers in a quarter-century will still be slogging through the atmosphere at 575 mph, that doesn't mean air travel won't make other futuristic leaps.
Flying, battery-powered taxis small aircraft intended to make shorter urban jaunts could become a reality in the next decade.
""Central Park to Brooklyn or Jersey City using an air taxi that is very exciting,"" said Kopsaftopoulos.
There's also considerable aviation industry interest in fully-electric commercial airplanes, noted Kopsaftopoulos.
""It is ideal we'll save huge amounts of fuel,"" added Amano, who said perhaps the technology could be tested in smaller commercial planes in a decade or so. What's more, there's a number of electric plane startups forging ahead, modifying existing planes, and planning for tests.

But in the end, whether an aircraft runs on a massive battery that sits in its belly or pricey fuels, it's likely these planes will be flying at the speeds they've been flying since the mid-20th century. 
Traveling at supersonic speeds is ""astounding,"" said van der Linden, who had the opportunity to experience the Concorde flying at 1,300 mph. ""You are flying faster than the Earth is spinning,"" he said, adding that it felt like traveling on a normal airliner.
But money wins the race. Our trusty, long-lived, old-school airliners are only replaced after decades and decades of service by lighter, increasingly efficient planes with sleeker interiors, but never anything faster.
""Airliners do not break,"" said van der Linden. ""They do fade away, but they dont die.""","In the year 2044, our cities might be energized by fusion power plants, our sleek cars may all run on electricity, and our doctors might regularly employ gene-editing to cure blindness.

Jake Bright,"As the mobility world awaits Harley Davidsons EV debut, theres plenty of motion in the e-moto startup space.
Zero Motorcycles unveiled its new 110 horsepower SR/F model in New York this week, offering a 200 mile range, one hour charge capability, and top speed of 124 mph.
The California based startupwhose investors include New York VC firm Invuswired the SR/F with Zeros new Cypher III operating system and Boschs Motorcycle Stability Control.
Both combine to offer remotely synced mobile connectivity to the motorcycles charge status and performance controls. The 485 pound SR/F is upgraded from Zeros existing line-up to include cornering ABS, traction control, and a new app and dash interface.
Zeros two-wheeler comes in at an entry price of $18,995. On the business side, the EV startup could produce as many as 10,000 SR/Fs and add members to its 200 dealer network, CEO Sam Paschel told TechCrunch in New York.
Zeros SR/F enters the e-moto market in a year where EV startups will face more competition on specs and pricing, and big motorcycle manufacturers will feel more pressure to go electric.
From a business perspective, as TechCrunch has reported, the U.S. motorcycle industry has been in pretty bad shape since the recession. New sales dropped by roughly 50 percent since 2008, with sharp declines in ownership by everyone under 40. The exception is women, who have become the only growing motorcycle ownership segment.
E-moto upstarts have worked to attract new riders and close gaps with gas motorcycles in performance and costbut most offerings have come with some compromise.
Italian company Energicas models hit high marks in tech controls and performancewith 150 horsepower, 30 minute fast-charge times, and 125 mile rangebut not without a hefty price of $20K and up.
Lightning Motorcycles, another California based e-moto startup, offers ultra-high end of performance, claiming the worlds fastest production motorcycle in the world with its LS-218. But the $38K, 218 mph, track bred e-moto isnt exactly average rider accessible. 
Zero Motorcycles has found the widest market and model breadth, with prices starting at $8K on its FX model. Still, Zero’s e-motos (including the $16K SR) havent matched the performance control options, specs, or charge-times of the higher priced Energica Ego or Eva.
In 2019, Zeros new machineand a model being teased by Lightningcould bridge gaps in performance, range, charge-times, and price that have held many back from going e-motorcycle.
With its Bosch MSC system and upgraded operating system, the fully redesigned SR/F matches Energica in digital performance controls and comes close on power and speed at a more competitive price.
As TechCrunch reported, Lightning began taking reservations for a $12,998 Strike e-moto with some almost unbelievable stats at that price: 150 mph top speed, 35 minute charge-time, and 150 mile range. Lighting calls it their first premium mass-market motorcycle, with plans to unveil sometime in March.
Both Zero and Lightnings 2019 models are positioned to compete with Harley Davidsons EV entry, the $29K LiveWire expected to debut sometime this summer. HD revealed more product specs recently, such as 3 second 0-60 mph acceleration and 110 mile range. Harley Davidson has also indicated it plans a full pivot to electric, with additional e-motorcycles in the pipeline, as well as e-bicycles and scooters.
Harley’s electric moves, as well as Zero and Lightning’s more competitive offerings, could hasten major motorcycle manufacturers’ plans to sell e-motos. None of the big names producersHonda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, BMWhave offered a production electric street motorcycle in the U.S. HD will be the first.
With momentum in the motorcycle world shifting electric, there are more than a few caveats as to whether there’s a viable U.S. market. In addition to the contracting sales environment, the e-moto startup space has racked up a series of failures. These include Brammo, Mission Motorcycles, and more recently,  Alta Motorsa California based EV venture backed by $45 million in VC that ceased operations in October. Alta had a partnership with Harley Davidson (now defunct) and there’s been little light shed on what forced them to shut off the lights.
Alta Motors resurfaced last week, when Canadian company BRPthe owner of such brands as snowmobile maker Ski-Doo and watercraft producer Sea-Dooacquired select Assets of Alta. There had been hopes someone would purchase and revive the California e-moto startup, but that looks unlikely. “We don’t have any current plans for resuscitating Alta Motors in it’s old form,” BRP’s Vice President for Communications Leslie Quinton told TechCrunch. “We have no plans yet to announce how we’re going to use the technologies,” she said.
So as Harley Davidson, Zero, and Lightning move to mainstream electric motorcycles in 2019, it appears another e-moto startup has officially faded into history.","As the mobility world awaits Harley Davidson’s EV debut, there’s plenty of motion in the e-moto startup space.

Tom McKay,"We’ve all been playing a waiting game with “Mad” Mike Hughes, the DIY enthusiast and Flat Earth theory advocate who planned to launch himself in a steam-powered rocket some 1,800 feet into the sky at 500 miles per hour as some kind of confusing statement on the curvature of the planet. Hughes, who has one prior DIY launch in 2014 under his belt, originally planned to launch a newer, crowd-funded $20,000 rocket with “RESEARCH FLAT EARTH” emblazoned on the side from the Mojave Desert ghost town of Amboy, California, in November. But as the countdown to the launch drew down, the Bureau of Land Management informed him he couldn’t fly over public lands, forcing the launch’s cancellation.

It could be nothing.” In a video posted to YouTube on Sunday, Hughes explains the different ways he attempted to get the rocket to launch, which he says failed because he could not get combustion due to an improperly functioning actuator. Or possibly plunger. It’s unclear. Hughes says in the video that “there is a probability” blast-off could happen today. However, he says he “has to be in court on Tuesday morning” thanks to legal efforts he says he’s pursuing against several government entities, which makes a Monday launch unlikely. “I don’t know, guys,” Hughes said to the crowd gathered for Saturday’s failed launch. “I’m just one man.” [ Route 66 News ]","We’ve all been playing a waiting game with “Mad” Mike Hughes, the DIY enthusiast and Flat Earth theory advocate who planned to launch himself in a steam-powered rocket some 1,800 feet into the sky at 500 miles per hour as some kind of confusing statement on t…",2018-02-05T12:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Flat Earth Rocketeer Once Again Fails to Launch Himself Into the Sky at 500 MPH,https://gizmodo.com/flat-earth-rocketeer-once-again-fails-to-launch-himself-1822712646,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--mHkoHIMW--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/jowgwv1gmaqwjkuq53mu.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,mph,1

Megan Rose Dickey,"The National Transportation Safety Board has released a preliminary report detailing the fatal crash involving a Tesla Model X in March. The crash also resulted in a fire and shut down two lanes of Highway 101 near Mountain View, Calif. At this point, the NTSB has yet to determine a probable cause of the crash and is continuing to investigate the accident. The report says the Model X, while in Autopilot mode, sped up to 71 mph in the seconds leading up to the crash. “At 3 seconds prior to the crash and up to the time of impact with the crash attenuator, the Tesla’s speed increased from 62 to 70.8 mph, with no precrash braking or evasive steering movement detected,” the report states. Source: NTSB/S. Engleman Tesla’s Autopilot mode is designed to match the speed of a slower vehicle traveling ahead of it. At the time, Autopilot was set to 75 mph, according to the NTSB. A Tesla spokesperson declined to comment but pointed me to its March blog post, where the company describes how the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for the six seconds prior to the collision. The NTSB confirmed that in its preliminary report today. “Tesla Autopilot does not prevent all accidents – such a standard would be impossible – but it makes them much less likely to occur,” Tesla wrote in a March blog post. “It unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists.” Walter Huang, the owner of the car who died as a result of the crash, had previously taken his car into the Tesla dealership, saying his car had a way of veering toward the exact barrier his car hit, ABC7 reported.

Andrew Liszewski,"In order to safely pilot a remote control quadcopter that can hit speeds of well over 160 miles per hour, pilots wear video goggles that give them a first-person view from the tiny crafts. Its not only a safer way to pilot RC planes, but when you bump the speed up to 265 MPH, as YouTuber Omegoolibird did with a customized aircraft, the experience is as close as you can probably get to flying like Superman or Iron Man.
The plane Omegoolibird used was a pusher-prop Vasamodel Fusion, which places the spinning propeller at the back of the craft, instead of the front. To hit the face-melting speeds captured in this video, the Fusion was upgraded with a Leopard 3674 X2 brushless electric motor that can hit spin speeds of up to 35,000 revolutions per minute. You might assume that would simply shred the planes propeller, but it was specifically designed to endure those obscene speeds and held strong. The only side effect, if you can call it that, was the incredibly satisfying high-pitched whine of the prop and motor you can hear in the video.
Omegoolibirds modified Fusion isnt the fastest RC plane in the world; remote control gliders have been clocked hitting well over 500 MPH. But being able to virtually climb aboard this tiny plane thanks to a camera streaming a live video feed of the flight makes it far more compelling as you get to experience these speeds first-hand, without the need for ever getting your pilots license.

Darrell Etherington,"Passenger drones could be traversing city skies sooner than you think – German aircraft maker Volocopter recently flew its first autonomous passenger drone tests in Dubai, flying for five minutes at around 650 feet in a trial with no one on board. Long-term, the plan is to have aircraft zipping around at between 30 and 60 mph, with 30 minutes of in-air operating time and the ability to pick up and drop-off passengers on demand, with no pilot required. Volocopter co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer Alex Zosel will join Atomico partner Yann de Vries on stage at Disrupt Berlin 2017 to discuss the challenges of building a new kind of aircraft company aimed at the looming opportunity of autonomous passenger flight, which is increasingly an area of interest and investment from startups all the way up to aerospace industry giants. Zosel, a serial entrepreneur, can shed light on what it takes to build a company from the ground up focused on making something that seems ripped from science fiction a practical reality. It’s a tech problem, to be sure – but also one that’s fraught and complex on the side of regulation and public trust, which definitely puts it among the most ambitious goals a startup can pursue today. Atomico’s de Vries can speak to why autonomous air travel is turning into a bit of a hot spot for venture interest, despite its many obvious roadblocks, and what’s on the horizon for bold bets in the future of transportation. Get your Disrupt tickets right now to save 30 percent off of your tickets and see Zosel and de Vries talk about the future of mobility — prices will go up in a couple of days.

Matthew Humphries,"This story originally appeared on PCMag Tesla prepared everyone yesterday for the Semi truck reveal, and it certainly delivered an impressive vehicle capable of carrying 80,000 pounds of cargo. What we didn't expect, though, was a brand new version of the Tesla Roadster brought on stage in the back of a Semi. Tesla is claiming the new Roadster is the quickest production car in the world, and it's hard to argue against that when looking at the base specs. The Roadster will accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 1.9 seconds. Zero to 100 mph takes 4.2 seconds, and quarter mile acceleration is 8.8 seconds. Then there's the top speed, which hasn't been revealed yet but is north of 250 mph. As for wheel torque, it's gauged at 10,000Nm. So the Roadster is fast, but Tesla doesn't seem to have compromised to achieve the speed. It's an all-wheel drive supercar that can seat four people and travel 620 miles on a single charge. The glass roof is removable and stored in the trunk making it a convertible, and I doubt anyone would argue about how great it looks. For this level of performance, especially with a Tesla badge attached, you can expect to pay a small fortune to own one. The base price will be $200,000 with a $50,000 deposit required. There is also a Founders Edition costing $250,000, of which only 1,000 are set to be offered. Regardless of how quickly you can get that $50,000 deposit together, Tesla won't deliver the new Roadster until 2020. Before anyone scoffs at the $200,000 price point, keep in mind the performance on offer and the competition it beats. Look at any of the new supercars in development by Mercedes, McLaren, Ferrari, Lamborghini or Bugatti, and prices start at $500,000 before quickly going up into the millions. Tesla has them all beat.

Bloodhound has already built and tested a viable racing car to speeds of 200mph, but the project is in debt and needs to find £25m or face being wound up... Bloodhound said its programme had been a catalyst for research and development, as well as helping interest schoolchildren worldwide in science and engineering, with an associated educational campaign reaching more than 2 million children...

Nick Douglas,"If I was setting up curriculum at a university, says engineer Foone Turing, Id make an entire semester-long class on the Challenger disaster, and make it required for any remotely STEM-oriented major. Because, says Foone, the disaster was a lot less random or simple than people tend to think. In a thread of 102 tweets, which you can read in essay form here, Foone explains the real reason behind the Challenger disaster, the 2003 Columbia disaster, the sinking of the Titanicand the last time you melted down from anxiety.
The Challenger disaster wasnt a single mistake or flaw or random chance that resulted in the death of seven people and the loss of a two billion dollar spaceship, says Foone. It was a whole series of mistakes and flaws and coincidences over a long time and at each step they figured they could get away with it because they figured the risks were minimal and they had plenty of engineering overhead. And they were right, most of the time. Then one day they werent.
Normalization of deviance
Foone describes the specific cascades of shortcuts and mistakes that led to these famous disasters, and the similar cascades that lead to horrific car crashes on supposedly safe roads. The common factor is that a system is built and stress-tested for one set of circumstances, then stretched a little further in regular use, then finally stretched so far, in a non-optimal situation, that something reaches a breaking point. And all the fudges and allowances fall apart in catastrophic failure. Foone calls this Normalization of Deviance.
A certain road, for example, is built for a 50 MPH speed limit. But because drivers will always push it, the engineer makes sure the road is safe all the way up to 70 MPH under normal conditions. Inevitably, drivers end up taking it at 60 MPH, since everyone knows thats still safe. And then a few people figure it must be safe to drive a little faster than the normal 60 MPH. And a few go even faster. And then it rains, and someone still goes 80 MPH and they crash and die.
Everyone designing a system is constantly fighting against normalization of deviance. And the more things are designed to accommodate misuse, the more the users misuse it. Were in an arms race. And not just designers and engineers, but all of uswere all designing our own lives with a normalization of deviance.
Personal disaster prep
Weve all been there at some point: failing a test because we pulled too many all-nighters, or missing a deadline because we couldnt find those extra hours we thought wed have on the weekend, or having a huge fight because we piled up too many tiny grievances with our partner, or going bankrupt for a medical bill because we spent as much as we earned and tried to live inside a rapacious capitalist system.
When it comes to following standard financial advice, how many of us can say we actually have three 
Read more Read
Yes, the systems around us build in certain stressors and failure points, and until those systems are fixed, we have to try not to stack too many other stressors on top of them. Personally, as the father of a three-month-old baby, Im quite freshly aware of this! Before, if the laundry or dishes or grocery shopping didnt get done, enough other stuff was going smoothly that the household could function fine until the weekend. Raising a baby puts a lot more stress on the system, and it becomes crucial to run the dishwasher, or to load the laundry in time to get everything dry and folded before bedtime. A baby is a series of little catastrophes, so theres less room for the others.
Catastrophe-aware empathy
The second personal lesson (another big one for a new parent): everyone around you is also managing a whole system of pressures and impending disasters, sometimes a lot more than you are, so you should be patient and empathetic with them.
In less personal terms, this is why asking someone for just five minutes of their time or just a few bucks is a bigger ask than you think. Its why whenever you want something from someone else, you should think about every possible obstacle and sacrificetravel time, opportunity cost, incidental expensesand take them on yourself. Meet someone near their workplace, pay the tab, secretly pad out deadlines so a delay wont be a catastrophe.
In close relationships, look for each others normalizations of deviance, and help them de-escalate. Take things off each others plate, swap errands or appointments, combine resources, cover for each other during stressful periods. And give yourself that same empathy.
And then, of course, get ready to adapt, because normalization of deviance comes for us all. The best we can do is give it fewer chances to cause a disaster.

Darrell Etherington,"Jaguar has finally fully revealed the official I-PACE all-electric SUV, a vehicle with just under 240 miles of range and a 0 to 60 mph time of under five seconds. The car can also charge to 80 percent from empty in 40 minutes using special quick charger hardware, and a 15-minute top-up is good for around 62 miles of additional range. The I-PACE looks like Jaguar’s best attempt to do a Tesla impression in more ways than the electric powertrain, however: The automaker is also promising over-the-air updates for the car, and connected controls that tie in to a mobile app for your phone, including charging status information. OTA is a first for Jaguar with this new EV offering. In the cabin, there are touchscreens for infotainment readout, along with standard physical controls for additional cabin control options. The vehicle has the silhouette and physical footprint of a crossover or compact SUV, but it’s also designed to make the most of its interior and luggage space, with fold-flat rear seats and nearly 400 gallons of total interior volume with that configuration. The car’s batter is located centrally in the base of the car, which provides a 50/50 weight distribution split between the back and front of the vehicle according to Jaguar. Those batteries power front and back axle motors, which means it’s also an all-wheel drive vehicle, and of course emits zero emissions. Pre-orders for the car start today, and the SUV will begin being delivered to buyers in the second half of 2018. We’ll find out about U.S. pricing, and get a closer look at the car, next week at the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland.","Jaguar has finally fully revealed the official I-PACE all-electric SUV, a vehicle with just under 240 miles of range and a 0 to 60 mph time of under five seconds.

Wirecutter,"Who should get a treadmill? If you have established a walking or running habit, having a treadmill in your home might make it easier or more fun. You'll save time and money by not having to commute to the gym, and you have more control over your workout environment. But if you haven't yet started walking or running regularly, the experts I spoke with all advised against making this several-hundred-dollar purchase right off the bat. It's better to first learn about your exercise preferences and make sure you'll actually stick with your new routine. How we picked and tested Having pared down many options, the nine treadmills we chose to test. Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald To find the best treadmill, we looked for models with a belt length of at least 55 inches, the minimum that's generally recommended for runners 6 feet tall and under. If you're over 6 feet, consider a machine with a belt that's at least 60 inches. No matter your height, you'll want a treadmill that offers a variety of incline options, which mimic the stress of exercising on hilly terrains. You'll also want a treadmill that can reach 10 mph and hold the body weight of anyone who will be using it. It should also come with a variety of interval programs, which vary speed and incline to keep exercise interesting. To test each treadmill, four of my colleagues and I spent a week running, jogging, and walking on nine treadmills. After using each treadmill, we noted how it felt underfoot and how intuitive it was to use. I also measured each treadmill's dimensions, as well as the time it took to reach different speeds. Finally, I repeatedly folded the treads and adjusted the belts, to mimic storage and maintenance. Our pick: ProForm 505 CST Our pick, the ProForm 505 CST. Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald The ProForm 505 CST has all the features you need in a treadmill and costs about half as much as many other models we considered. The interface is easy and pleasant to use, and the belt is relatively quiet. The ProForm inclines to 10 percent, goes as fast as 10 mph (a six-minute mile, nearly twice as fast as a leisurely jogging pace), and offers 18 interval programs. The console features two large water-bottle holders and two media shelves: one beneath the display, and one above it. The display itself simply shows distance, speed, calories, and time. There's not much to figure out, and no way to get lost if you push the wrong button. It also comes with a warranty rivaled only by that of our upgrade pick: a lifetime frame warranty, 25-year motor warranty, and one-year parts and labor warranty. Runner-up: Gold's Gym Trainer 720 Our runner-up treadmill pick, the Gold's Gym Trainer 720. Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald If our top pick is sold out or the price spikes, we'd go with the Gold's Gym Trainer 720 instead. It's made by the same company and is in the same price bracket as the ProForm 505 CST, and it shows: They feel similar underfoot, offer the same range for speed and incline, match warranties, and cost about the same. However, the display is harder to read, cycling through key stats rather than leaving them up on the screen, and the 720 lacks a graphic display to show the contours of an interval workout. The Gold's Gym Trainer 720 goes up to 10 mph, and inclines up to 10 percent. It's foldable, but lifting the belt takes a little effort. It comes with 18 interval programs, but there is no graphical display to show the content of those at a glance. Still, the display was ""very straightforward and easy to understand,"" according to one of our testers. Upgrade pick: NordicTrack c990 Our upgrade treadmill pick, the NordicTrack c990. Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald If you want more interval workouts, a detailed graph of the speed and incline of your workout, or are over 6 feet tall, we recommend the NordicTrack c990. Though it's several hundred dollars more than our top pick and has a touchscreen that comes with a bit of a learning curve, it offers extra features that more frequent treadmill users will like, such as more interval workouts and a fan that actually makes a difference. It also has the best warranty of any treadmill we tested: a lifetime frame and motor warranty, a three-year parts warranty, and a one-year labor warranty. The NordicTrack c990 can go up to 12 mph (a five-minute mile) and a 12 percent incline, nearly the fastest and highest of all the treadmills we tested. It comes with 32 interval programs, and you can see summaries of several of them at once when making a selection. During a workout, the screen can display up to seven stats simultaneously. However, the fancy screen can be confusing to operate at times, and the machine often tries to sell you on a $9/month subscription to iFit, Icon Fitness's extra-content service.

Zac Estrada,"“It’s just like driving a fast Bentley,” the man in the passenger seat said as I gripped the steering wheel of the $2.6 million Bugatti Chiron. “What does that even mean?” I thought to myself. About a mile down Highway 101 in Paso Robles, California, his point was becoming clear. In the initial moment when I sank myself into the Bugatti’s low driver’s seat, I was careful to make sure my shoes didn’t scuff the leather-covered door panel, and that I remembered to take the pen out of my back pocket so there would be no chance I would blemish the fantastically stitched red leather seats. Unlike other extraordinarily powerful and fast cars, this car is no more stressful to operate than an Audi, which is why observers had more wild expressions on their faces than I did as it passed other cars on the highway. Admittedly, extraordinary performance figures have made up a lot of the Chiron’s allure since it was unveiled in 2016. It gets up to 62 mph (100 km/h) in as little as 2.4 seconds, to 124 mph (200 km/h) in still less time than most conventional cars take to reach half that speed. That’s due to the 8.0-liter, 16-cylinder engine that’s assisted by four turbochargers to produce 1,500 horsepower. Placed behind the two seats, you hear at least one of the turbos whoosh and whir every time you gently touch your foot to the accelerator pedal. Those sounds alone are intoxicating, likely even more so at its 261 mph top speed. The interior is weirdly serene for a car that does this kind of speed — unlike driving an Audi, and more like riding in the back of a big Bentley sedan. Oh, and it stops, too. Bugatti set a record in September with the Chiron, going from 0 to 400 km/h and back to 0 again in 42 seconds. (Not that I needed to test that out, mind you.) The technical brilliance of this car is how it stays on the road. The Chiron is the follow-up to the Bugatti Veyron, the previous titleholder for fastest car in the world. It’s also a follow-up to one of the most technically ambitious cars ever, something beyond your “everyday” Ferraris and Lamborghinis that can make 250-ish mph feel somehow calming. I didn’t get to take the Chrion up to its top speed, as I was stuck on a highway that the California Department of Transportation is always doing something to. But at those highway speeds (and a little higher than highway speeds), you’re able to appreciate how the Bugatti remains calm when you want to remain calm. Being part of the vast Volkswagen Group, some of the instrument panel pieces and graphics are similar to those found in recent Bentleys and Porsches — cars that cost a mere $100,000 to $300,000. It’s not cost-cutting; it’s usability. Unlike hyper cars made by tiny manufacturers in what are pretty much office parks around the world, Bugatti has the backing of one of the world’s largest automakers. Everything works, and that’s rather beautiful. But then you look at the really striking pieces, such as the minimal knobs along the center console, where even makers Porsche and Lamborghini stick a big infotainment screen and other various knobs. Instead, a single piece of carefully finished metal splits the carbon fiber dashboard and houses the quartet of multifunction knobs for adjusting the audio system ( the one with diamonds in it ), or fan — you know, all you really need in a car. If you really need to know vital car information, it’s in one of the screens near the speedometer. It’s all meant to hide in the background, rather than inundate you with unnecessary information. There are cars that have already topped the Chiron’s improbable in the 18 months or so since it’s been out. A Tesla Model S P100D can technically beat it to 60 mph, too. But there’s more to a Bugatti than its speed. In many ways, its straight-line performance deserves a mere mention considering the attention paid to every other detail in it. Outside, it looks like what a fantasy car should look like: low, wide, with enormous air vents running along the sides, and the appearance that more space is devoted to the engine than to the occupants. The most terrifying thing about driving the Chiron on public roads is watching eyes turn to gawk at it when those eyes should be looking at more important things. Driving the Bugatti Chiron confused me a little. Maybe the opportunity to drive it hadn’t sunk in once I got out of it. Since it doesn’t seem to scream at you at parking lot speeds, it leaves little impression when you just want to get somewhere. Maybe there aren’t enough buttons or screens or menus to play with once you’re in it. It took me a while, but the Chiron is likely meant to be appreciated more than driven quickly. It’s packed with so much sophistication that it creates a serious demeanor — perhaps intimidatingly so — which is why I’ll forever be in awe of it, even if I don’t talk about it all the time.",There are equal parts sophistication and horsepower,2018-01-03T15:55:23Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Looking at the Bugatti Chiron is just as much of an event as driving one,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/3/16379098/bugatti-chiron-2-6-million-supercar-drive,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wnrexp5_DyWpnOFns4VEBljDVtU=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9350705/_DAF6442.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,mph,1
Tom McKay,"When last we heard of “Mad Mike” Hughes, the 61-year-old limo driver and stuntman who planned on launching a $20,000 steam-fueled rocket with “RESEARCH FLAT EARTH” painted on the side some 1,800 feet into the air at 500 miles per hour, the gosh darn government had intervened to tell him he couldn’t conduct any such launch on public lands. But Hughes has not been deterred, and in a number of posts on his Facebook page he claims to have a real launch planned for February 3rd. This one will be a vertical rather than horizontal launch, which Hughes believes will prevent him from crossing over into public property and thus getting in trouble with the government. “That way we got enough buffer that when it lands, it will not be on [Bureau of Land Management] property,” Hughes said in a video last week. Hughes has launched homemade rockets with himself as the human cargo before, but he’s only recently become a Flat Earth convert at the same time he needed to raise further funds for DIY rocketry, according to the Washington Post. It’s still not entirely clear what Hughes intends to prove with the launch because, as LiveScience noted, observing the curvature of the Earth requires one rise some 35,000 feet (10,700 meters) above the ground. Hughes’ rocket will not be capable of attaining anywhere near that height, which is good because videos of his parachutes are far from reassuring. However, our guy is not a huge fan of the scientific disciplines anyhow, as he told the Associated Press in a prior interview: I don’t believe in science. I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air, about the certain size of rocket nozzles, and thrust. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula. There’s no difference between science and science fiction. We’ve all been let down on this Flat-Earth-rocket stuff before, but Hughes seems pretty insistent that this time there will actually be a launch. In a Facebook thread over the past few days, Hughes additionally announced there will be “No spectators” and that “Any drone flying near the private property will be shut down... our own drones will be recording anyone filming and their license plates.” “I am the only man in history to design then build then launch myself in my own rocket,” he added. “So fly your drones up your ass.” [ Popular Mechanics / LiveScience ]","When last we heard of “Mad Mike” Hughes, the 61-year-old limo driver and stuntman who planned on launching a $20,000 steam-fueled rocket with “RESEARCH FLAT EARTH” painted on the side some 1,800 feet into the air at 500 miles per hour, the gosh darn governmen…",2018-01-24T05:20:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Rebuffed Flat Earth Rocketeer Says He Will Actually Launch Himself Into the Sky at 500 MPH This Time,https://gizmodo.com/rebuffed-flat-earth-rocketeer-says-he-will-actually-lau-1822364177,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--AEtVpYrj--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/wcpxeu29whcydpe6jj0j.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,mph,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Well that escalated quickly. Hurricane Aletta became the first tropical storm of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on Thursday, and by Friday morning it had spun up into a Category 4 monster. The storm might not be done ramping up, either. The meteorological marvel is thankfully not forecast to make landfall (though rip currents and swells are possible along Mexico’s west coast this weekend), which means we can safely gawk at its beastly nature. The storm’s rise has been a swift one. It became a tropical storm on Wednesday and puttered around throughout the day. But things changed in a big way on Thursday into Friday. At 3 p.m. local time on Thursday, the storm became the first hurricane of the eastern Pacific season as a Category 1 storm with 75 mph winds. The storm’s location—in the open ocean with no interference from land—and warm waters for fuel are what caused Aletta to blow up. By 9 a.m. local time on Friday, it had ballooned into a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. That 65 mph increase in less than 24 hours more than meets the criteria for rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm’s windspeed increases at least 35 mph in a day. Even the National Hurricane Center (NHC) seems a bit agog at what happened with Aletta. “The remarkable intensification of Aletta has continued through this morning,” forecasters wrote in their most recent update about the storm. “The short-range intensity forecast is particularly difficult since there are no obvious reasons why Aletta should cease intensification.” The forecast calls for Aletta’s winds to pick up a little more speed to 145 mph before it hits rough steering winds that will tear it back down to a tropical storm by the end of the weekend. Aletta may be a beast, but the eastern Pacific is no stranger to explosively powerful storms. You may remember that this same region spawned Hurricane Patricia—the most intense hurricane ever recorded—back in 2015. That storm rapidly intensified, peaking with winds at a mind boggling 215 mph (well above the 155 mph Category 5 threshold). Rapid intensification was also a hot topic last year during Atlantic hurricane season. Four storms blew up in the Atlantic last year, including Maria. How climate change affects rapid intensification is an active area of research. Some studies indicate the most intense storms are becoming, well, more intense in parts of the Atlantic. Other findings suggest climate change could cause Atlantic hurricanes to rapidly intensify more often as they approach land. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 and after three weeks of relative quiet, it appears to be waking up. Another storm is on the horizon. NHC has an eye on an area of clouds and thunderstorms currently sitting off the coast of Central America that has a 90 percent chance of organizing into a tropical system in the next 48 hours, which would be named Bud. Early signs indicate that the storm could pose more of a threat to land, potentially getting sucked into the Southwest.","Well that escalated quickly.

Emme Hall,"Volkswagen has been on a bit of a motorsport tear lately. First it sent the I.D. R, a purpose-build electric race car with 680 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque, up Pikes Peak, obliterating the 5-year-old record of 8:13.878 with a time of 7:57.148. Then it set a land-speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats of 210.16 miles per hour in a souped-up 2019 Jetta. Impressive accomplishments, both. Nobody except racing driver Romain Dumas got to drive the supersweet I.D. R, but Volkswagen recently invited me out to Bonneville to have my own go in the 2019 Jetta land-speed record car. And my oh my, what a go it was. The 2019 Jetta sports a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine, good for just 147 horsepower. So in order to break a speed record, some serious modifications were in order. The folks at THR Manufacturing swapped out the 1.4T for the a 2.0-liter engine (that you'll see in the soon-to-be-released Jetta GLI) and modified it with new connecting rods, pistons, valves, camshafts, turbocharger and exhaust system. The basic block and crankshaft are stock, but all told, this thing now puts out a whopping 600 horsepower. Power gets to the front wheels through a six-speed manual transmission. Special wheels and tires, as well as a limited-slip differential, help provide traction on the salt while stopping power is improved thanks to a rear-mounted parachute. As you'd expect, the interior is totally stripped out in order to save weight, save for a full roll cage, racing seat and fire suppression system. A full roll cage and not much else adorns the inside of the Bonneville Jetta. Volkswagen When I arrived in Bonneville, I told myself I'd be happy if I hit 185 mph. My previous personal land-speed record was 160 mph, achieved on the front straight at Laguna Seca Raceway in a 2018 Dodge Challenger Hellcat. I figured topping that speed by 25 mph was an achievable goal that would still push me just above my comfort level. The team buckled me into the Jetta's five-point harness, showed me how to pull the chute and let me roll up to the starting line, palms sweating and tummy aflutter with nerves. Imagine my surprise when I found myself at 120 mph during my practice run in what seemed like 10 seconds, with nearly 4 miles to go on the 5-mile track. ""Oh hell,"" I thought. ""This is going to be easy."" Turned out to be not quite so easy. I won't spoil the surprise here, but my second run was, shall we say, far from perfect.

9 with 7 posters participating
The family of a Florida man who died in a high-speed accident involving a Tesla has sued the automaker, alleging that his Tesla's battery was defective and that the company was negligent when it removed a speed governor on the car.According to the lawsuit, Edgar Monserratt v. Teslawhich was filed Tuesday in Broward County courtMonserratt's 18-year-old son was a front-seat passenger in a 2014 Tesla S being driven by another person, Barrett Riley.
Riley was driving southbound over 116 mph on Seabreeze Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale on May 8, 2018, when he hit an adjacent wall. The Tesla came back into the road, then hit a light pole on the opposite side of the street.
The car ""erupted in flames,"" according to the complaint, and Monserratt's son, Edgar Monserratt Martinez, died as a result of the crash.
Approximately two months before the crash, Riley received a speeding ticket on a Florida highway for traveling 112 mph in the same Tesla. In fact, his parents had Tesla install a ""speed limiter/governor"" on the car that set an artificial top speed at 85 mph.
However, when the car was in at a Tesla service center in Broward County weeks later, the governor was removed without the permission or knowledge of Rileys parents.
The elder Monserratt argues that Tesla was negligent when it removed the limiter. In addition, lawyers for the family claim that the car itself was ""defective and unreasonably dangerous"" as its batteries were not ""adequately protected and shielded"" in a way that would have protected against a ""thermal runaway.""
""The Tesla S battery was prone to extremely intense fires incapable of being timely extinguished,"" Philip Corboy Jr., one of the family's lawyers, said in a statement, noting that there ""have been at least a dozen worldwide reported cases"" of Tesla S batteries catching fire during a crash.
According to the National Fire Protection Association, American fire departments responded to an ""estimated average of 152,300"" car fires per year from 2006 through 2010.
Keely Sulprizio, a Tesla spokeswoman, declined to respond to Ars' questions, but she did send a corporate statement.
""Our thoughts continue to be with the families affected by this tragedy,"" the company said. ""Unfortunately, no car could have withstood a high-speed crash of this kind. Tesla's Speed Limit Mode, which allows Tesla owners to limit their car's speed and acceleration, was introduced as an over-the-air update last year in dedication to our customer's son, Barrett Riley, who tragically passed away in the accident.""",Florida passenger died when the driver crashed car at 116 mph.,2019-01-09T01:10:39Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Tesla sued after fatal crash, accused of making “unreasonably dangerous” car",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/tesla-sued-after-fatal-crash-accused-of-making-unreasonably-dangerous-car/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-841634388-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,mph,1

Tom McKay,"61-year-old stuntman and amateur Flat Earth theory researcher “Mad” Mike Hughes, who planned to launch himself in an untested homemade steam-powered rocket at 500 miles per hour over the Mojave Desert ghost town of Amboy, California on Saturday in some sort of gambit to prove the Earth is flat (spoilers: it’s not), will not be doing any of that that this weekend. Instead, Hughes told the Washington Post, Big Daddy Government has thrown a few obstacles in his way. Per the Post, the Bureau of Land Management has confirmed it had no record of giving Hughes “verbal permission” to hold the rocket launch on public lands as he had previously claimed, meaning that the rocketeer has decided to delay the launch date and move the location “three miles down the road.” “I don’t see [the launch] happening until about Tuesday, honestly,” Hughes told the Post. “It takes three days to set up... You know, it’s not easy because it’s not supposed to be easy.” “Someone from our local office reached out to him after seeing some of these news articles [about the launch], because that was news to them,” BLM spokesperson Samantha Storms told the paper. It’s not the first time Hughes has planned to launch himself into the sky in a homemade rocket—a prior attempt in 2014 earned himself injuries from intense G-forces and a rough landing—but as the Post noted, he’s only recently become a Flat Earth convert “after struggling for months to raise funds.” Hence the “RESEARCH FLAT EARTH” slogan on the side of his rocket, and Hughes’ plans to launch himself progressively higher into the sky if Saturday’s planned event was a non-lethal success. In a Kickstarter post from 2016, Hughes wrote “Mad Mike Hughes always wanted to be famous. So much that he decided ‘What can I do to become and instant super star dare devil?’ So he decided to break the world record for the longest ramp jump in the world... He is the current world record holder for a ramp rocket jump, but he wants to shatter that record on February 12th 2016 (Just 1 day before his 60th birthday).” While crowdfunding only raised him $310 of his $150,000 goal then, the Flat Earth connection later helped him raise $8,000 of the eventual $20,000 it cost to build the rocket. However, the BLM decision seems to have bought Hughes some time before the potentially deadly manned test of his DIY scalding steam missile—time which he apparently does not intend to use to reconsider whether this is a good idea. “I don’t believe in science,” Hughes previously told the Associated Press. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air, about the certain size of rocket nozzles, and thrust.

Tom McKay,"SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy launch went pretty well this afternoon, with the rocket’s two partially reusable Falcon 9 strap-on boosters making successful landings at Kennedy Air Force Station after jettisoning from the craft three minutes post-launch. However, the rocket’s center core did not function as founder Elon Musk and team intended, and appears to have later crashed back down to Earth. Hard. Per the Verge, after breaking away from its upper stage (the portion of the Falcon Heavy carrying its Tesla Roadster payload), the core experienced engine problems. It didn’t quite miss the remotely piloted ship where it was supposed to land, exactly, but neither the core or the ship survived intact: The center core was only able to relight one of the three engines necessary to land, and so it hit the water at 300 miles per hour. Two engines on the drone ship were taken out when it crashed, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in a press call after the rocket launch. According to Engadget, Musk said the core landed some 100 meters from the ship but that a massive spray of shrapnel did indeed make contact. There apparently may be video of the crash, but Musk said that depends on if “the cameras didn’t get blown up as well.” Sounds like the core is scrap at the bottom of the ocean. That’s certainly not ideal, but it’s also a relatively minor mishap given the Falcon Heavy set history as the most powerful rocket currently in operation and successfully sent the Roadster on its path towards the rest of the solar system. Plenty of rockets exploded or slammed into the ground on SpaceX’s path to today, and it’s likely they will continue to do so as Musk and team continue development. Regardless of the fate of the last rocket section, the launch demonstrates the Falcon Heavy can successfully deliver a payload instead of breaking up due to “ unanticipated vibrational resonances,” which is what matters to paying customers. According to Space.com, SpaceX already has two commercial launches using the rocket scheduled for 2018, the Arabsat 6A communications satellite and a U.S. Air Force mission which will also carry a solar-sail experiment. As TechCrunch noted, the end goal is for Musk’s company to be able to “turn rockets around in less than 24 hours and have reflown boosters go up twice in one day.” According to Musk, his Roadster is well on track to exceed Mars orbit and will come close to the orbit of the minor planet Ceres in the asteroid belt, where it could potentially orbit for hundreds of millions of years barring a collision with another spaceborne object.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific. A dangerous super typhoon currently packing 170 mph winds could make landfall in Japan early next week. Typhoon Jebi, which started getting organized east of Guam on August 27, exploded to life over the last few days, intensifying from a Category 1 to a Category 5-equivalent storm between August 29-30. Currently located 300 miles northwest of Saipan, Jebi is moving northwest at 16 miles per hour, continuing its trek over open ocean into the weekend before making an expected northward veer early next week. That turn will place it on a direct course for mainland Japan. Recent model runs show a high chance of the storm making landfall near Kyoto, potentially as a powerful typhoon. “Jebi was in a fairly classic environment for rapid strengthening,” Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther via email, citing warm ocean waters and favorable upper level wind conditions. “Its forecast track is also a textbook case of recurvature,” with initial movement toward the west or northwest before curving around to the north at mid-latitudes. Henson added that because Japan’s islands run southwest to northeast, “a small change in the track could have a big impact on exactly where Jebi makes landfall.” East of Shioku and south of Honshu, the storm could kick up waves up to 10 meters (33 feet) high as it approaches Japan, creating a hazard for ships, according to AccuWeather. But the real concern is the impact on the heavily populated areas within the storm’s forecast cone of uncertainty, including Tokyo. Flooding, mudslides, and destructive winds are all possible impacts. If this feels familiar, it is because we’ve been here before. Japan has already seen heavy rainfall associated with two typhoons, a tropical depression and a tropical storm this month, AccuWeather notes. In July, western and central Japan experienced historic rainfall and deadly landslides brought on in part with Typhoon Prapiroon, with Typhoon Maria following closely on its heels and delivering even more rain to the nation’s southern Ryukyu islands. With northern hemisphere tropical cyclone activity often peaking in September and lasting through November, Japan may not be out of the woods for a while.","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific.

Steven Ewing,"The McLaren Speedtail is a three-passenger, 1,035-horsepower hypercar that can allegedly accelerate from 0 to 186 miles per hour in 12.8 seconds and reach a terminal velocity of 250 mph. Yet somehow, that's only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for what McLaren calls its ""ultimate road car."" After all, it isn't the performance data that stops you in your tracks upon seeing the Speedtail for the first time. As McLaren executives pulled the sheet off the very first Speedtail prototype at a preview event in London last week, it was instead the sheer size and curvaceous shape that immediately sealed the deal. The Speedtail looks like a singular sculpted piece, a sort of ultramodern take on the silver speed-record streamliners from decades ago. The McLaren Senna might be a computer's definition of aerodynamic excellence, but the Speedtail's impressive form is absolutely the result of a human hand's finesse. The Speedtail is 205 inches long -- an inch longer than a Chevrolet Tahoe -- yet at its highest point, it barely crests my waist. The edge of its rear deck sits just above knee-level. Every swoop, every cut, every air duct -- they're all integral to the Speedtail's ability to hit that 250-mph top speed. So too are the fixed, carbon-fiber, front-wheel aero covers, and tiny digital rear-view cameras that extend from the dihedral doors. In fact, when you activate Velocity mode in the hopes of achieving that top speed, the active chassis control lowers the car by nearly an inch and a half, for maximum aerodynamic efficiency. Truth be told, I sort of figured this car would just be a sort of Long Tail take on the 720S -- long and low, but still familiar as a McLaren. I love the teardrop shape of the cockpit. I love the way the central high-mounted stop light runs the length of the car's spine, nestled between two huge intakes that feed air to the engine. I love that the Speedtail looks like a 1960s vision of The Future, as if The Jetsons' society never managed to figure out flying cars. The entire body is made from lightweight carbon fiber, parts of which are actually flexible. On each end of the tail, active ailerons can actually bend, reducing turbulence and drag at higher speeds. According to McLaren, these ailerons ""adjust to move the center of pressure and provide the required level of downforce precisely when it is needed most."" It's airspace tech in an automotive application, and it alleviates the need for a silly rear wing. The Speedtail is said to weigh just 3,153 pounds in its lightest configuration. The body material itself is what McLaren calls ""titanium deposition carbon fiber,"" where a micron-thin layer of titanium is fused directly into the fiber's weave, becoming an integral part of the construction. For the front splitter, rear diffuser and side skirts, McLaren uses a ""1K"" version of this carbon fiber, which makes it lighter than the material used on the rest of the body. The titanium within can also be anodized in any color a customer chooses, for added visual flair. You can ""create interwoven images, symbols or even words,"" according to McLaren. Might I suggest the Roadshow logo? Impressive aerodynamics and light weight are one part of the Speedtail's performance story; the powertrain within is another. McLaren isn't divulging specific details just yet, only confirming the Speedtail uses a ""petrol-electric hybrid powertrain"" that delivers the aforementioned 1,035 horsepower. When running in Velocity mode, the engine's idle speed is adjusted to fully charge the batteries, mounted low and in the center of the car's frame. All told, you're looking at 12.8 seconds to get from 0 to 186 mph. That's a full 3.7 seconds quicker than the already-insane McLaren P1. The central driver's seat has a trio of screens ahead, and several vehicle controls -- including the gear selector buttons -- are housed on the headliner. McLaren McLaren says the Speedtail uses a rear-wheel-drive layout, but I have a sneaking (read: totally unconfirmed) suspicion there are electric motors mounted at each of the front wheels. Speaking of, the Speedtail's wheels measure 20 inches up front and 21 inches at the rear, wrapped in Pirelli tires developed specifically for this car. Assuming the tires on the show car I saw are the real deal, you're looking at 235/35ZR20s up front and meaty 315/30ZR21s out back. Of course, the Speedtail isn't just about, well, speed. As one McLaren representative explained, the Speedtail ""needs to take its owner and two friends to the opera on Park Lane on the same set of tires."" Just like the iconic McLaren F1, the Speedtail uses a three-passenger seating arrangement with a central driving position. We've known this for a long time -- when the car was first confirmed in 2016, it was codenamed BP23 : Bespoke Project 2, 3-seater. But unlike the F1, there are no central rails that separate the three individual passenger compartments. The driver's seat is set forward, with a commanding view of not only the world ahead, but a trio of high-resolution digital displays that show everything from pertinent vehicle information to navigation and infotainment functions. The engine-start button, Active Dynamics Panel, switch for Velocity mode and buttons to close the windows and doors, meanwhile, are housed in panels above the driver's head, which -- there's no other way to say it -- is so freaking cool. Flexible rear ailerons are found on both sides of the tail, improving downforce at super-high speeds. McLaren Nestled behind the driver on either side are two passenger seats, both of which are fully formed into the Speedtail's carbon fiber, monoblock tub. Every surface is either finished in aniline leather or carbon fiber, and naturally, the color customization options are nearly endless. The windscreen wraps up and over the top of the cockpit, where it meets the glazed upper sections of the doors, as well as sort of porthole above the driver's head. If the expansive glass area lets a little too much light in for your liking, the porthole, door uppers and rear quarter panes use electrochromic technology that turns the glass opaque at a moment's notice. The Speedtail doesn't have sun visors, either -- the top of the windscreen uses the same electrochromic tech. McLaren says cargo space is actually quite ample, with compartments at the front and rear. Of course, buyers will likely want to opt for the automaker's new, bespoke set of luggage, specifically designed to fit the Speedtail. And that's even before you talk to the team at McLaren Special Operations (MSO), where, according to the automaker, ""anything is possible."" Don't forget to spec your Speedtail with 18-carat white gold badges, too. McLaren will sell 106 Speedtails -- the same production run as the F1. Each one costs around $2 million, and they're already spoken for. McLaren Only 106 examples of the Speedtail will be produced -- the same number of McLaren F1s sold worldwide -- and all of them are already spoken for. The cost of entry is £1.75 million (about $2.2 million based on current exchange rates), though McLaren fully expects owners to tack on a number of options, so as-delivered prices will likely be much higher. Of the 106 cars being built, a small chunk are destined for homes in the United States, where they aren't actually road legal. Never mind the digital side mirrors -- US crash standards aren't too keen on a central driving position, so owners will likely need to register their cars under ""show or display"" rules should they want to, I don't know, drive them to Target. Design director Rob Melville calls the Speedtail ""a future concours d'elegance winner,"" and a future classic. On design alone, I'd likely agree. Combine that with incredible hybrid performance, and you've got a car that'll indeed standout as a pinnacle of the modern McLaren Automotive.

Robbie Gonzalez,"A wickedly fast fastball isn’t the anomaly it once was. A decade ago, Major League pitchers threw a grand total of just 196 triple-digit fastballs in a single season. Last year, 40 pitchers collectively threw 1,017. But while baseball’s hallmark pitch has increased in popularity, it hasn’t increased in velocity. Consider the confusion over the game’s fastest fastball ever. On paper, the honor goes to Yankees relief pitcher Aroldis Chapman, who clocked 105.1 miles per hour in 2010. But the record could have been set all the way back in 1974. Back then, Nolan Ryan was the first MLB pitcher to be tracked by radar during a game—and while his heater topped out at 100.8 miles per hour, the radar measured Ryan’s ball just before it crossed the plate. Had it eyed the pitch as it was leaving Ryan’s hand (as Chapman’s was), experts believe it might have registered at upwards of 108 miles per hour. Similar retroactive estimates have put Cleveland Indians pitcher Bob Feller’s fastest fastball at 107.6 miles per hour—and that was all the way back in 1946. Walter Johnson, who played from 1907 to 1927, is also thought to have thrown pitches at a 100 mph or more. All of which is to say: Pitchers have been throwing north of 100-mph for the past 100 years. Over the same time period, advances in training, technology, nutrition, and, yes, drugs, have fueled a dramatic upward trend in world-record athletic performances, from the marathon to the long jump to the 50 meter freestyle. But when it comes to hurling a five-ounce, leather-wrapped sphere as fast as possible, humans appear to have plateaued. “I don’t see it going much higher,” says biomedical engineer Glenn Fleisig, research director of the American Sports Medicine Institute and an expert in the biomechanics of pitching. “I'm sorry to say that, but I don’t see it happening. Baseball isn’t like other sports, where we see people running faster or swimming harder or whatever, where today’s records are smashing the records from 10 years ago.” That hasn’t prevented pitchers from pursuing the triple-digit barrier at the expense of their arms. A significant number of them undergo major medical procedures to correct injuries from competition. Like the “Tommy John” surgery: When the tendon in a pitcher’s elbow tears, surgeons can replace it with a fresh one from the player’s wrist, forearm, hamstring, or even their toe. Swapping in the relief tendon involves the surgeon drilling holes in the ulna and humerus bones and threading them in a figure-8 pattern with the healthy tissue. A 2012 survey found that a quarter of Major League pitchers had undergone the Tommy John surgery at some point in their careers. And as the popularity of the fastball has increased, so has the surgery.. Fleisig thinks the rise in Tommy John surgeries has to do with the immense strain that hurling baseballs puts on a pitcher’s arm. By studying cadavers, he and his colleagues found that the force required to tear elbow ligaments is roughly the same as what a pitcher asks of his arm throwing at top speed. When the arm flings back, the shoulder ligaments experience about 100 Newton meters of torque. When it flings forward, the elbow ligaments suffer the same. “It’s the equivalent, at each point, of holding five 12-pound bowling balls,” Fleisig says. “So imagine I hang 60 pounds from your hand. That’s what it would feel like on your elbow or shoulder.” At those forces, he says, pitchers are effectively throwing their arms off. The odds of them throwing much faster seem pretty slim. Which may actually be a good thing, as fastballs are already right at the limit of what batters can reliably hit. A 100-mph fastball reaches home plate in under 400 milliseconds. The swing itself takes about 150 milliseconds. That leaves less than a quarter of a second for a batter to spot the pitch and decide whether and where to swing. That’s absurdly fast, which may explain why the swinging strike rate for triple-digit heaters is almost three times higher than it is for lesser fastballs. But the tiny reaction window is only part of why batters struggle to connect. The other culprit: lack of practice. As popular as they’ve become, 100-mph fastballs are still pretty rare—rare enough that you’re not going to face off against them regularly at batting practice. Unless you’ve got a workaround. The baseball team at Villanova University recently got access to a tireless pitcher who can throw fastballs all day long—even impossibly fast ones. Engineer Mark Jupina designed a virtual hitting simulator that allows batters to practice identifying and even hitting against any pitch in the MLB’s PITCHf/x database. (PITCHf/x is a tracking system installed in every MLB stadium that records the velocity, trajectory, release point, and spin of every pitch.) Players can either face off against the virtual pitcher in the university’s CAVE (an immersive, four-walled virtual reality environment equipped with infrared cameras), or by donning an Oculus Rift headset. “We have data sets that are appropriate for a high school level, all the way up beyond the pro level,” Jupina says. “We can even show you what, realistically, 120 mile an hour fastball would look like.” I stood in the simulator and stared down a 120-mph pitch. It was ludicrous. The trip from the mound to the plate took just three tenths of a second; I felt like I needed to start my swing before the ball even left the pitcher’s hand. Then a few members of Villanova’s baseball team took a crack at the simulator, and Jupina showed me how they planned to use it in training. Fastball practice was only part of the exercise. In one activity, he’d freeze the ball 150 milliseconds after leaving the pitcher’s hand, and ask the batter to ID the pitch. Was it coming in fast and straight, or was it a slow breaking ball? Would it cross the plate high and inside, or right down the middle? Me, I couldn’t tell a fastball from a slider, but Villanova’s players took to it quickly, using things like the position of the pitcher’s arm and the spin of the ball to identify the pitch. It was impressive to watch, in part because it’s always impressive to witness someone exercise a sense you do not possess yourself. But also because the latency, the resolution, the sense of depth—they were all good enough to make reading an incoming pitch possible. All of which could make this a tremendous training tool. “In the future, I could see every Major League baseball organization having this available to their hitters,” says Villanova’s head baseball coach Kevin Mulvey, a former pro pitcher himself. “If you could upload the pitcher that you're going to be facing to this virtual interface, in the stadium that you'll playing, at the time you'll be playing, and you can get in there and re-live an at-bat that you had against him, you're going to be better prepared to face this guy than if you were just taking batting practice off a generic lefty or generic righty."" After all, not many people can throw a triple digit pitch. But with a tool like Jupinas, a whole lot more could train to hit one.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weve seen a lot of weird-ass tropical cyclones in recent years. This week, we can add another one to the list.
Typhoon Wutip formed and brushed Guam late last week. That alone made it an oddity in terms of timing and location. But rather than weakening as forecast, the storm blew up into a Category 5 monster over the weekend. That makes Wutip the first Category 5 storm of any kindtyphoon, cyclone, or hurricaneever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere in February.
When we covered Wutip on Friday, all forecasts pointed to the storm wimping out over the weekend. Instead, the storm exploded into a super typhoon, a storm with winds in excess of 150 mph, on Saturday into early Sunday morning. Its sustained winds leaped from from 125 mph to 160 mph in just 12 hours with gusts reaching up to 180 mph, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. That put it well above the previous February record holder, Super Typhoon Higos, which saw winds top out at 150 mph winds in February 2015. It also made Wutip the first February Category 5-equivalent storm to form not just in the Pacific but anywhere in the northern hemisphere.
Wutip also looked the part, with satellite imagery straight out of central casting. The storm had a wide and symmetrical eye at its peak. Both are characteristics of an annular cyclone, storms that tend to be exceptionally strong and usually form over open water. 
Typhoon Wutip as of Tuesday afternoon in a slightly less formidable state.
GIF: Colorado State University
The storm has since weakened as it chugs toward the Philippines, but what caused the power up seems to have been a bit of meteorological luck. The normal recipe for rapid intensification is weak upper level winds and ocean waters warmer than 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). Those conditions are rare in the northern hemisphere in February, though El Niñowhich is currently in effectdoes tilt the odds towards them slightly in parts of the Pacific. In the case of Wutip, upper level winds were moderate and sea surface temperatures were around 29 degrees Celsius (84.2 degrees Fahrenheit), which was slightly warmer than normal.
Not prohibitive for rapid intensification, but also not a slam dunk. It appears Wutip simply beat the odds.","We’ve seen a lot of weird-ass tropical cyclones in recent years.

Jake Holmes,"Same sporty crossover, now with more features. Jaguar Jaguar is updating the F-Pace crossover slightly for 2019, giving the model more standard equipment across the range. The F-Pace was introduced for the 2017 model year and slots above the newer, smaller E-Pace. One change is that Jaguar's In Control Touch Pro infotainment system, which features a 10-inch touchscreen, is now standard across the board, rather than optional. Also now standard are active safety technologies: lane keep assist, driver attention monitoring, precollision braking and parking sensors. The adaptive cruise control adds a steering assist feature that helps keep the F-Pace centered in its lane and the traffic sign recognition system has been updated so it can recognize more types of signs. There are also new ""slimline"" sports seats in the cabin, as well as ""suedecloth"" headliners and illuminated door sill plates. The engine lineup is unchanged. F-Paces badged 25t use a 247-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four, the 20d badge signals a 180-horsepower 2.0-liter turbodiesel, the 30t has a 296-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter and the S variant packs a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 with 380 horsepower. Bundling in those extra features does bump up the prices of the Jaguar F-Pace's various trim levels by modest amounts, from $525 to $2,535 depending on version (the Portfolio is the exception, cutting $200 this year).

Jon Porter,"Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HyperloopTT) has unveiled the first of its full-scale capsules that it hopes will one day be used to transport passengers at 750 miles per hour, reports Bloomberg. The California-based company is one of several Hyperloop contenders that have sprung up to deliver on Elon Musk’s 2013 transportation vision. The company will now transport the capsule to Toulouse in France, where it has begun construction of its test track, for further assembly and optimization. HyperloopTT says it hopes it’ll be “passenger ready” by 2019. HyperloopTT’s ‘Quintero One’ pod is around 105 feet long and weighs 5 tons. It’s constructed “almost completely” out of the company’s own composite material which it has dubbed “ Vibranium,” in a nod to the fictional material from the Marvel comics. The company claims the material is “eight times stronger than aluminum and 10 times stronger than steel alternatives.” Separately, Virgin Hyperloop One has produced a full-sized prototype of the internals of its pod, in addition to a miniature system it uses for testing. Tesla also has a miniature prototype of its own which it uses for testing. However, despite the amount of investment and the sheer amount of companies working in the area, the Hyperloop is still a long way from reality. The maximum speed reached by a pod is 284 mph. However, WARR’s prototype (which was a miniature pod weighing just 85kg) was still a long way off the 750 mph Musk hopes the technology to one day achieve.",HyperloopTT has unveiled the first of its full-scale capsules that it hopes will one day be used to transport passengers at 750 miles per hour.

Eric Adams,"Aviation enthusiasts yearning for ultra-fast, ultra-sleek intercontinental transportation—rather than 18-hour flights on stuffed-to-the gills widebody behemoths—might finally get their wish. At least, if the airplane concept Boeing unveiled this week becomes reality. The company revealed renderings of its proposed hypersonic, passenger-carrying airliner Tuesday at the annual American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics conference in Atlanta. Both visually and technologically, the airplane, which could be used for both military and commercial purposes, has much in common with an unmanned hypersonic surveillance and reconnaissance concept the company revealed in January. Both share the general delta-wing configuration with dual rear fins, a streamlined fuselage, and a sharp nose. The craft would travel at up to Mach 5, enabling it to cross the Atlantic Ocean in just two hours and the Pacific in three. (A merely supersonic aircraft flying between Mach 1 and Mach 2 would take an hour or two longer.) The plane is fast, but it could have been even faster. “We settled on Mach 5 version,” says Kevin Bowcutt, Boeing’s senior technical fellow and chief scientist of hypersonics, noting that exceeding Mach 5, or about 3,800 mph, requires far more advanced engines and materials. Plus, it’s not worth it. “This aircraft would allow you to fly across the ocean and back in one day, which is all most people would want. So why go past those boundaries and complicate it? The world’s just not big enough to go much faster than Mach 5.” A Mach 5 aircraft can also be built more affordably than plane that goes Mach 6, 7, or 8 because it would use readily available titanium for its structure instead of materials like composite ceramics to manage the heat produced at higher speeds. Boeing’s current proposal would also use a relatively simple pairing of a jet engine and a ramjet, called a turboramjet, instead of less proven scramjet engines required for faster aircraft. For this plane, the two engines would share the same air inlets, and the jet engines would operate up to Mach 2 or 3 before the inlets seal off the jet engine and divert air into the ramjets, which can handle faster airflow. The famed SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft used such a system in the 1960s, as have multiple missiles and experimental aircraft. Boeing is collaborating with Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems on the engine technology. Though Boeing hasn’t decided the final dimensions, the airplane (which doesn’t have a name yet) would be larger than a business jet but smaller than a 737, Bowcutt says, so presumably seating between, say, 20 and 100 passengers. It would cruise at 95,000 feet, which is 30,000 feet higher than the supersonic Concorde flew, and a full 60,000 feet higher than the average airliner. That altitude maximizes the efficiency of the engines and keeps turbulence to a minimum, since the air density is so much lower that far up in the air. The G-force feeling upon takeoff would last a full 12 minutes as the plane accelerated to cruising speed (on a conventional craft the feeling lasts just a few seconds) but the cruising-altitude experience should be serene, with stunning views featuring the earth’s curvature at the horizon and the blackness of space above. “Other than that you would also weigh a bit less,” Bowcutt says. “At that altitude you’ll be a few pounds lighter than on the ground.” Boeing says a production aircraft with these capabilities—including autonomous piloting, as that technology continues to evolve—could be ready in 20 to 30 years, though a prototype could be ready in as soon as 5 or 10. A lot will have to go right for the effort to succeed, and such an aircraft would need to arrive with substantial proof of reasonable cost, safety, and efficiency in order for airlines and the military to want to actually fly it. This concept does, however, have advantages over other long range, high speed transportation visions, most notably the proposed next generation of supersonic jets. Those airplanes actually only go a bit faster than commercial aircraft—even though they break the sound barrier in the process. (The speed of sound at 35,000 feet is 660 mph; the average jetliner cruises at 575 mph at the same altitude; the fastest currently proposed supersonic jet would travel at Mach 2.2 at 50,000 feet, or 1,450 mph, and the rest hover around Mach 1 or 1.2.) They also tend to be smaller, which means they may not be able to carry much fuel and thus may have shorter ranges than airlines might like. Hypersonic jets could also stack up favorably against vehicles in the other end of the spectrum: suborbital rockets. Both SpaceX’s Elon Musk and Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson have indicated that they want to adapt their rockets for global flights, reaching from New York to Sydney, for instance, in just an hour. Though rocket-powered spaceships are certainly exciting, Bowcutt thinks that air-breathing vehicles—meaning, those that ingest oxygen from the atmosphere for combustion rather than carrying it along with them in liquid form—have much greater potential. Rockets will never be as reliable as airplanes, for one thing, and they are scary and uncomfortable. “The overall safety risk is much higher in a rocket while the passenger comfort level is much lower.” Indeed, rocket re-entries into the atmosphere are notoriously brutal experiences, given that the vehicles have to use steep descent angles and blunt shaping, as opposed to the sleek pointy-nose look of a hypersonic jet, to generate enough drag to slow down enough for landing. But a hypersonic aircraft will be so smooth and fast during all phases of flight that it could effectively glide unpowered for the final 500 miles of each trip. It might take a bit longer—and you won’t be able to float around the cabin while in space—but you also won’t be throwing up on the way back down.

Sasha Lekach,"New York City has been a holdout in the electric scooter craze, but after a city council hearing Wednesday, that could finally change.
The city's Committee on Transportation introduced four bills concerning e-scooters and electric bicycles. Companies like Bird and Lime that rent out the motorized scooters haven't been allowed to operate in the city's five boroughs, despite a growing international presence.
The four bills include a pilot program for shared e-scooters and legalizing e-scooters that can only go  up to 15 mph. A similar bill would allow for the use of e-bikes with a max speed of 20 mph, while another creates a conversion program for throttle e-bikes to become pedal-assist e-bicycles.
SEE ALSO: NYC lifts ban on electric bikes, but hoverboards still illegal
Previously, a 2004 New York state law banned any motorized scooters. Last year, NYC mayor Bill de Blasio lightened up the rules with an exception for electric-assist bicycles that still require pedaling to move. This was seen as an overdue win for the courier and delivery-worker community that relies on the bicycle's extra boost. The mayor isn't the biggest fan of motorized vehicles zooming around the city. 
Now the fight moves onto e-scooters.
Council member Ydanis Rodriguez has been vocal about legalizing electric transit options, along with council members Rafael Espinal and Fernando Cabrera. The three members held a rally before the Wednesday meeting, where the four bills were introduced. 
HAPPENING NOW: Rally @ City Hall Park. The time is now to move our City into the future of transit by legalizing e-bikes &amp; e-scooters and stop ticketing delivery workers utilizing the technology. pic.twitter.com/IeVqwUwIFX
 Ydanis Rodriguez (@ydanis) January 23, 2019
The meeting went on for more than five hours weighing what seemed like every aspect of bringing in new motorized vehicles from charging infrastructure, to protected bike lanes, to the impact on congestion and the environment. 
A spokesperson for council member Rodriguez said this is the first meaningful step to allow the battery-powered devices on city streets.
Now that the council and community members were able to discuss the bills, the council will take more public comment and input from agencies and others involved in e-scooter legalization. It looks somewhat optimistic that e-scooters could be allowed in NYC eventually, and likely with many caveats.
E-scooter company Lime is obviously eager to enter the new market and has a Manhattan event with its next generation e-scooter planned for later this week, noting it as a chance for ""New Yorkers to experience the possibilities that Lime offers to everyone."" The Facebook invite says city leaders will attend.
Back in November, the package of e-vehicle bills were technically first introduced, but were held up until the state gave the go-ahead. Now that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has given the OK for cities to figure out for themselves what to do about e-scooters, NYC is doing just that. But until the state budget is passed later this year, NYC might have to wait before the electric vehicles start zooming around.","New York City has been a holdout in the electric scooter craze, but after a city council hearing Wednesday, that could finally change.

Kyle Hyatt,"A year after the UK cities of Bath and Somerset enacted 20 mph ""safe zones,"" statistics reveal they are anything but. To reduce traffic deaths, Bath and Northeast Somerset declared 13 safe zones both in urban and more rural areas with strictly enforced 20 mph speed limits. The idea behind these zones is that with reduced velocity, drivers would be better able to react to pedestrians. In practice, this hasn't been the case, as nearly all areas have reported a higher instance of pedestrian deaths in the year since the new limits took effect. Now that officials know these zones aren't working, the logical thing to do would be to replace the new speed limits with the old ones, right? Well, according to the councils for Bath and Northeast Somerset, they can't because it would just cost too much money. The implementation of these safe zones cost the councils £871,000 ($1,165,576 at current exchange rates) and that changing them back would require approximately the same amount, money that apparently isn't in the coffers. Cars pass a 20 mph speed limit sign in Britain. Dominic Lipinski/PA Images While this situation may initially seem like a boon for the staunchly anti-""Speed Kills"" crowd, it is noted in the study that the areas of increased death (seven out of 13 total safe zones) failed to make use of additional traffic calming techniques such as speed humps, or other lighting and signage. Urban areas in Bath and Somerset where these additional traffic control measures are in place saw reductions in death and injury over the preceding year. Many large metropolitan areas in the United States are undertaking similar measures as part of the pledge known as Vision Zero, which seeks to end traffic fatalities by 2024, with 34 municipalities having currently taken the pledge. Despite its lofty goal, the Vision Zero movement has gained strength as a result of steeply rising traffic fatalities, the bulk of which are pedestrians. It will be interesting to see if the changes made in Britain, and their results, will mirror those in the US.","UK traffic ""safe zones"" feature reduced speed limits and one year in, they aren't working.",2017-12-19T00:22:15Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",20 mph safe zones result in more pedestrian deaths - Roadshow,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/20-mph-safe-zones-result-in-more-pedestrian-deaths/,https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/L4gI797tgQfram1-c8b9MLv5ePs=/2017/12/19/55c8bf38-6ef9-4724-b923-6dd4f656d08a/gettyimages-854430086.jpg,,Cnet.com,mph,1

SpaceX hosted its third Hyperloop Pod Competition on Sunday, and the fastest looping team broke the 240 mph world record set by Richard Branson's Virgin Hyperloop One last year.

This journey wouldn’t have been possible without you!” The team said its pod travelled almost 50 percent faster than last year, and its model went more than three times faster than the second place team this year. Elon Musk, the hyperloop tsar himself, even reportedly attended the competition held at SpaceX's 0.8-mile test track in Hawthorne, Calif. (a Los Angeles suburb) with his five children and Canadian musician Grimes, his current girlfriend. Although his presence was not expected, it's not surprising that he would attend.

Alex Davies,"In the 99 years since it started making cars, Bentley has offered its well-heeled, well-groomed customers a bounty of choices. Endless color palettes, exotic woods, sacred cow leathers, massaging seats, huge engines, active safety technologiesthe sun never sets on this list of options. And yet, it has taken nearly a century for the British automaker to offer a convertible with a roof made of the most well-accented, most typically British of materials. Yes, the new Bentley Continental GT Convertible, unveiled today, has an optional tweed roof. (To be specific, a contemporary interpretation of traditional British tweed, meaning it looks like tweed but is still the kind of material thats good for car roofs.) So begins long list of goodies and gidgets, coolest among them the also-new rotating display. This being 2018, Bentley installed a 12.3-inch touchscreen display in the center console. But leaving such Apple CarPlay-supporting modernity lying around visible is as gauche as letting the servants use the grand staircase. Never fear! Just push a button and the display panel glides out of the dash and nestles out of view, revealing nothing more offensive than wood veneer (eight types available). Oh, there's more. To celebrate the pantheon of British explorers who canvassed the planet discovering things native peoples took for granted, spin the console thing again to reveal a trio of analog dials: a compass, temperature gauge, and chronometer, which you might call a stopwatch. Don't like the 12.3-inch touchscreen? Just spin it out of your sight. Bentley hasnt announced pricing for this car just yet, but considering the current car starts at $236,100, you shouldnt expect a bargain. After all, the rest of the car follows the standard Bentley pattern of engineering and design thats so excessive, you can only be impressed. The 6-liter W12 engine produces 626 brake horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque, enough to hit 60 mph in under four seconds and top out at 207 mph. The start-stop system kills the engine not just at red lights, but when the car is coasting, and helps get the cars EPA mileage rating up to a not-too-shabby 20.2 mpg. The antiroll system plays with the air suspension to keep the 3-ton behemoth flat through the corners, and disc brakes with 420-millimeter rotors mean it can stop on a silver dollar. Bentley also redesigned the Continentals headrest-embedded neck warmer (which emits warm air and is a genuine delight on a chilly day) to be quieter and more effective, and it offers a 10-speaker Bose audio system as well as a 18-speaker, 2,200-watt Naim setup. The convertible roof can open or close when the cars going up to 30 mph, and it uses new insulation and sealing materials to make the cars interior as quiet as the last generations coupe.

Jake Holmes,"If you need to travel 3 mph faster than you could in your current Bentayga, the Speed is for you.
Chris Paukert/Roadshow
The Bentley Bentayga adds a sportier new variant at the Geneva Motor Show. It's the sportiest version yet, and like all prior Bentley Speed models -- e.g., the Continental GT Speed -- it's ludicrously powerful and fast. Specifically, Bentley says the luxury SUV will sprint to 62 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds and top out at 190 mph. That's 0.2 second quicker and 3 mph faster than the regular Bentayga.
Bentley also claims a speed record for the Bentayga Speed. Its terminal velocity, translated from 306 kilometers per hour, makes the Bentayga Speed the fastest production SUV you can buy today. It just barely pips the Lamborghini Urus, which has its terminal velocity quoted at 305 km/h -- or so close that there's essentially no difference between the two. But, hey, bragging rights are bragging rights.
Providing all that performance is a reworked version of the Bentayga's 6.0-liter twin-turbo W12 engine, in this case dishing up 626 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque, the former an increase of 26 hp over the existing Bentayga W12. It's also an 84-hp gain over the available Bentayga V8. The SUV's Sport mode has been retuned, Bentley says, for better throttle responses, sportier exhaust sounds and a firmer ride from the Bentley Dynamic Ride active anti-roll system.
A big SUV traveling at 190 mph needs a lot of stopping power, so the Bentayga Speed is available with carbon-ceramic discs that Bentley claims are the largest on any production car. They were tested to withstand temperatures up to 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit and save 44.1 pounds versus the standard stoppers. The brakes hide behind 10-spoke 22-inch wheels.
Bentley designers restyled the Bentayga for Speed duty with a bigger roof spoiler, tinted headlights, darkened exterior trim pieces and subtle ""Speed"" badges. The cabin features Alcantara trim and illuminated ""Sport"" door-sill plates, though as with any Bentley, customers can personalize the cabin to their liking. No pricing has been announced for the Speed just yet, but based on past experience with the Continental GT Speed, it'll be a pretty penny.","With a top speed of 190 mph, it takes the fastest-SUV crown.",2019-03-06T07:09:48Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Bentley Bentayga Speed blasts into Geneva with 626 hp - Roadshow,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/bentley-bentayga-speed-geneva-motor-show/,https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/JkKtcbDJrlZVilhSpjKWDh2VtnE=/2019/03/06/1d1143d5-0125-4687-bb89-8bc76f201bd2/bentley-bentayga-speed-ogi.jpg,,Cnet.com,mph,1

Bill Chappell,"A satellite image shows Hurricane Florence looming in the Atlantic Ocean as the sun rises over the U.S. Florence is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to North Carolina and South Carolina on Thursday. NOAA/STAR Hurricane Florence is blasting toward the Carolinas, carrying sustained winds of up to 130 mph and the threat of ""life-threatening storm surge and rainfall,"" the National Hurricane Center says. A hurricane warning – meaning hurricane conditions are expected within 36 hours — is in effect for a long stretch of the coast, from the Santee River in South Carolina to Duck, N.C. — part of the Outer Banks. Hurricane conditions will likely hit on Friday, but tropical storm conditions will arrive on Thursday, the hurricane center said. ""Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the agency says. The threat has sparked a rush of evacuation efforts in South Carolina and North Carolina, with more than a million people urged to get out of Florence's way. Governors of those states have already declared states of emergency, as have the governors of Virginia and Maryland. Hurricane Florence is now expected to head more directly west after making landfall, cross through South Carolina. The storm will bring dangerously high amounts of rain, forecasters say. NOAA/NWS, Esri, HERE, Garmin, USGS Forecasters have adjusted Hurricane Florence's predicted path, saying that after it makes landfall, it will likely take a more southerly route than had previously been expected. Rather than pushing up toward western Virginia, the storm's center is now predicted to move across the middle of South Carolina. For a swathe of the North Carolina shore from Cape Fear to Cape Lookout, the storm surge could range from 9-13 feet, the NHC said. In Myrtle Beach, S.C., and nearby areas, the surge could hit 6-9 feet. As of 8 a.m. ET, Florence was 530 miles southeast of Cape Fear, N.C., moving west-northwest at 17 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. ""An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft that was in the hurricane until just after midnight"" recorded a peak wind gust of around 150 mph, the hurricane center said. Florence is currently heading for ocean water with surface temperatures of around 85 degrees, meaning it will likely strengthen on its way to the East Coast. Even with some weakening that's predicted just before it makes landfall, the storm ""is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane as it approaches the coastline,"" the hurricane center said. Satellite images show the storm has maintained a distinct eye, and it's well organized. Its maximum sustained winds are expected to top 145 mph before it loses some steam near the coast. Current forecasts call for its winds to be at least a Category 3 storm when it arrives at the Carolinas. ""A motion toward the northwest is forecast to begin by this afternoon and continue through Thursday,"" the hurricane center says. ""Florence is expected to slow down considerably by late Thursday into Friday, and move slowly through early Saturday."" Rainfall totals from Hurricane Florence will top 20 inches in some areas, the National Weather Service says. National Weather Service The slow movement, combined with the massive amount of moisture this storm holds, will bring dangerous rains – from 20 to 30 inches in coastal North Carolina, with 40 inches possible in isolated areas, the weather service says. In South Carolina and inland parts of North Carolina, 5 to 10 inches of rain could fall, with 20 inches possible in some areas. ""This rainfall would produce catastrophic flash flooding and significant river flooding,"" the hurricane center said.","Rather than pushing up toward western Virginia, the storm's center is now predicted to move across the middle of South Carolina after it makes landfall.",2018-09-12T13:02:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Hurricane Florence Zeroes In On Carolinas, Bringing 130 MPH Winds",https://www.npr.org/2018/09/12/647005403/hurricane-florence-zeroes-in-on-carolinas-bringing-130-mph-winds,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/09/12/flo-satellite-color_wide-b1d67968e6ceb5343b2ec3d747874a434da725cd.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,mph,1
Jake Holmes,"McLaren has let slip a few more important numbers that should get you even more excited about the new 600LT. While we already knew the LT -- for Longtail -- was far more extreme than the 570S, there are now specific figures to back that up. The car will rocket to 60 miles per hour in 2.8 seconds, from rest to 124 mph in 8.2 seconds and it boasts a top speed of 204 mph. Those numbers make the 600LT just as quick to 60 and only 1 mph slower than the earlier 675LT. Not that we should be surprised that it's a performer, given the specs of the 600LT. McLaren's latest supercar tweaks the company's twin-turbo, 3.8-liter V8 to produce 592 horsepower and 457 pound-feet of torque, gains of 30 and 14, respectively, compared to the 570S. Moreover, the 600LT is five pounds lighter than the 570S coupe, at 2,749 pounds dry. As quick as the 675LT and almost as fast. McLaren A starting price in the US of $240,000, then, sounds reasonable for all the performance. McLaren will also throw in a free day of driver training for buyers, giving them what it calls a Pure McLaren Road Owner Track Day. We'd say it makes sense to learn a bit about controlling something as extreme as the 600LT. There will of course be several options available on top of that base price. MSO Clubsport, a $29,370 package, starts with ""Super-Lightweight"" carbon-fiber seats that, when equipped, make the 600LT a whole 220 pounds skinnier than a 570S Coupe. It also features new carbon trim for the shift paddles, infotainment system surround and steering-wheel spokes, a carbon-fiber roof, carbon fender louvers and titanium wheel bolts. To go even further, the MSO Clubsport Pro package ($34,600) adds a harness bar and six-point harness for race-track usage. Those lightweight seats, incidentally, are offered as a standalone option for a cool $6,060. Five-spoke wheels can be optioned for $4,950 if you don't like the standard 10-spoke design. The 600LT with its 675LT predecessor. McLaren The McLaren 600LT also gets new bodywork compared to the 570S Coupe, replete with top-exit exhausts and various aerodynamic tweaks to deliver 220 pounds of downforce at 155 mph. Its cabin has been stripped of carpeting, which saves 12.6 pounds alone, and lightweight suspension components come from the McLaren 720S. The carbon-ceramic brakes have a new brake booster based on learnings from the Senna, which McLaren promises will deliver better brake feel and shorter stopping distances. Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tires, in a compound designed specifically for the 600LT, are standard. McLaren will start production of the 600LT this October and says that total volume will be limited, though no exact number of cars has been specified. That's in part because of the difficulty of tooling its carbon-fiber body panels.","With a top speed of 204 mph, you'll want all the driving instruction you can get.",2018-07-11T16:46:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}","McLaren 600LT will cost $240,000, comes with free driver training - Roadshow",https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/mclaren-600lt-price-specifications/,https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/emASNkza_92JkxFSQULFRMfZfcU=/2018/07/11/30225cc6-9eaa-4f05-85d7-03c048461147/mclaren-600lt-ogi.jpg,,Cnet.com,mph,1

Nicole Lee,"Simply called the Taro Tracking stabilizer, it works with the attachment of an infrared module (seen in the pictures here) atop the camera. Then, the athlete in question would strap on a wristband with an IR tag -- she can wear it out in the open or under her clothes -- and the module will immediately recognize it, and start following it around. And since it's following the athlete based on this IR connection, it doesn't matter if she skates behind a pillar or slides into the shadows -- the camera will still follow her every move. A Taro spokesperson tells me that it'll even track speeds of up to 50 mph. At CES, the Taro team has released two different versions of its stabilizer. One is the T1, which is for smartphones and GoPros and the other is the Taro TX, which is for DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. The infrared module is called the Taro M1, which you can buy separately.

http://www.facebook.com/fox43news,"Woodland, WA ( KPTV ) — The speedometer in the car of a Woodland family who died in a crash on the California coastline was “pinned” at 90 mph, indicating to officers the vehicle was running and in motion just prior to hitting the rocks below, according to court documents. A search warrant was served at the home of Jennifer Jean Hart and Sarah Margaret Hart on Thursday. A search warrant affidavit was granted in Clark County in connection with this investigation for items including travel itinerary, bank records, cell phone records, credit card billing statements, bank receipts, notes, journals and possible suicide notes. No details have been released about the results of the search at the couple’s home. The couple purchased the home in May 2017 and previously lived in West Linn. The Harts and at least three of their adopted children were killed after Jennifer Hart drove off a cliff near Highway 1 in the Westport area of Mendocino County on Monday, according to deputies. Their three other adopted children were believed to be in the car, according to deputies, but they have not been located. Court documents state California Highway Patrol investigators found no “acceleration marks, tire friction marks or braking furrow marks” at the scene. Investigators said there was no evidence the car collided with the embankment as it “traversed towards the tidal zone below.” “Based upon the California Highway Patrol investigation, it is their belief ‘a felony has been committed,’” according to court documents. Neighbors in Woodland told FOX 12 this week they contacted Child Protective Services when one of the children, 15-year-old Devonte Hart, came to their home begging for food for himself and his siblings.

Jake Holmes,"The standard Honda Civic Type R is incredibly practical, with up to 46.3 cubic feet of cargo space when the back seats are lowered. Yet engineers at Honda's Swindon, UK factory ("" A place where dreams become a reality "") have taken it even further with Project P, a concept version of a Type R pickup truck. The engineers took a preproduction Civic Type R and removed most of the upper bodywork behind the car's B-pillar, replacing it with some roll bars and a diamond-plate metal bed. The hatchback's signature giant rear wing is still present, and in a clever touch, can be removed to permit easy access to the bed for loading cargo. The work was all completed outside of working hours as a passion project for the engineers. This one-off Type R pickup truck and can hit 165 miles per hour. Honda Mechanically, the car retains the Type R's turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four engine, with 306 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque, as well as its six-speed manual transmission and adaptive suspension. Honda says the pickup concept will hit 62 miles per hour in less than 6 seconds, and pegs the top speed around 165 mph. That's only just behind the regular Type R's top speed of 170 mph. As a show car, Project P will be used at Honda events to transport and show off the company's lawnmowers and other power equipment. But the engineers behind the project would like to put it to a slightly more grueling test.

Andrew Tarantola,"The new NanoMap system from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), however, strikes the right balance between accuracy and speed. With it, drones can navigate heavily populated areas -- think forests or Amazon fulfillment centers -- at up to 20 mph. Simply put, the system doesn't sweat the details. Unlike other common mapping systems, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which are data intensive and difficult to maintain at real-time, the NanoMap uses depth-sensing to measure just the drone's immediate surroundings. This enables the drone to understand generally where it is in relation to obstacles and anticipate how it will need to change course to avoid them. ""The key difference to previous work is that the researchers created a map consisting of a set of images with their position uncertainty rather than just a set of images and their positions and orientation,"" says Sebastian Scherer, a systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, wrote in an MIT release. ""Keeping track of the uncertainty has the advantage of allowing the use of previous images even if the robot doesn't know exactly where it is and allows in improved planning."" This uncertainty is surprisingly helpful. Without working the factor into its modeling, MIT's test drone would crash roughly 25 percent of the time whenever it drifted more than 5 percent away from where it expected to be. But by incorporating that uncertainty, the MIT team was able to reduce crashes to just 2 percent of its flights.","The current generation of autonomous drone navigation and flightpath planning systems are almost too precise, demanding hundreds of measurements be taken so that the UAV knows exactly where it is in space at any given moment.

Elliot Williams,"A trebuchet is one of the older machines of war. It’s basically a sling on a frame, with a weight that you can lift up high and which pulls the sling arm over on release. Making one opens up the doors to backyard mayhem, but optimizing one opens up the wonders of physics. [Tom Stanton] covers just about everything you need to know about trebuchet building in his four-part video series. Indeed, he sums it up in video two: you’ve got some potential energy in the weight, and you want to transfer as much of that as possible to the ball. This implies that the optimal path for the weight would be straight down, but then there’s the axle in the way. The rest, as they say, is mechanical engineering. Video three was the most interesting for us. [Tom] already had some strange arm design that intends to get the weight partially around the axle, but he’s still getting low efficiencies, so he builds a trebuchet on wheels — the classic solution. Along the way, he takes a ton of measurements with Physlets Tracker, which does video analysis to extract physical measurements. That tip alone is worth the price of admission, but when the ball tops out at 124 mph, you gotta cheer. In video four, [Tom] plays around with the weight of the projectile and discovers that he’s putting spin on his tennis ball, making it curve in flight. Who knew? Anyway, all four videos are embedded below. You can probably skip video one if you already know what a trebuchet is, or aren’t interested in [Tom] learning that paying extra money for a good CNC mill bit is worth it. Video two and three are must-watch trebucheting. We’re a sad to report that we couldn’t find any good trebuchet links on Hackaday to dish up.

Andrew Krok,"The Alpina B7 is not your average BMW 7 Series. It rolls off the same line as the regular 7, but Alpina re-engineers a good chunk of it to create a car that's more luxurious, more powerful -- and more expensive. And the 2020 Alpina B7, announced Monday, keeps that tradition alive as it enters its third generation of US sales.
The 2020 Alpina B7 is the sixth generation of the automaker's hopped-up flagship par excellence. At the heart of the matter is an Alpina-massaged 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8. New engine management software and a host of other new parts result in an output of 600 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque. Its eight-speed automatic has been beefed up to handle the extra output, too.
Despite being a barge, its performance figures are damned impressive. It'll hit 60 miles per hour from a standstill in just 3.5 seconds, 0.1 seconds quicker than before. Given enough asphalt, this super sedan won't stop until it crests 205 mph, 11 mph more than the last generation. And with a dual-mode Alpina exhaust on tap, it can be silent or violent the whole way there.
Those wheels will never get old.
Alpina
Sporty doesn't always mean uncomfortable, though. The Alpina B7 has standard air suspension and rear-axle steering to keep handling tight without making the ride utterly exasperating. It also packs BMW's Road Preview system, which uses camera and navigation data to set up the suspension to handle bumps and other road annoyances. The system can lower the ride height by 0.6 inches at high speeds, or it can raise the car 0.8 inches to improve ground clearance.
The Alpina's trademark wheels are back for 2020, measuring 20 inches in diameter, although 21-inchers are also available. Behind those wheels are upgraded brakes, measuring 15.55 inches in the front and 15.67 inches in the rear. To further differentiate itself from the regular 7 Series, the B7 has a new front bumper, a new rear spoiler and a handful of paint colors unique to the B7.
The interior is dressed to the nines. Standard equipment includes a Nappa leather interior, a leather instrument panel, ceramic touches on the controls and soft-close doors. The steering wheel has blue and green stitching, while the doorsills have blue embedded lighting and a plaque stating its place in the production queue. Heck, even the gauge cluster has a unique Alpina design. New shields and insulation points make the interior even quieter than before. 
Of course, the B7 is a pricey proposition. When it goes on sale in the third quarter of 2019, it'll command $142,695 including destination, a far cry from the 7 Series' base price of $87,445.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","After a sluggish start to eastern Pacific hurricane season, the basin is making up for lost time. Hurricane Bud is the second of back-to-back major hurricanes to form in less than a week. The Category 3 storm is currently churning toward Baja California, though it’s thankfully forecast to weaken before likely landfall this weekend. As of 3 a.m. local time this morning, Bud was still picking up steam roughly 235 miles south of Manzanillo, Mexico. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) put Bud’s winds at 115 mph, making it a Category 3 storm. That’s the threshold for classifying storms as major hurricanes. Meteorologist Ryan Maue tweeted a more recent satellite image with data indicating Bud had reached Category 4 strength with winds around 132 mph. Either way, it’s quite a difference from how the storm looked yesterday. At 4 a.m. local time on Sunday, Bud had winds of just 50 mph, making it a moderate tropical storm. But just as Aletta before it, Bud underwent rapid intensification thanks to warm waters and low wind shear. Rapid intensification is a term used when a storm’s winds increase 65 mph in less than 24 hours. The outer bands of Bud’s winds could reach Mexico, prompting the NHC to issue tropical storm watches from Manzanillo north to the Puerto Vallarta area. The agency also forecast that up to 10 inches of rain could fall in isolated locations on Tuesday and “cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.” From there, Bud will continue to lumber northward. While the storm is expected to strengthen a bit more in the next day or two, it will then begin gradually decaying as it moves over cooler waters. It could reach Baja California near Los Cabos by Saturday as a tropical storm where floods and mudslides could again be a concern. From there, Bud or its remnants could push into the Southwest. While it’s too early to forecast what locations could be impacted or when they could get hit, it’s worth remembering that tropical systems can bring major flash flooding to the region, so keep an eye out as the forecast develops. The remnants of Hurricane Newton reached Arizona in September 2016, the last time a tropical system impacted the Southwest. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 without much fanfare. But the season has since gotten much more active. Bud follows Hurricane Aletta last week. That storm whipped up into a Category 4 hurricane on Friday, thankfully posing no threat to land. Aletta has since been downgraded to a tropical storm and is meandering westward into the Pacific as it weakens. No other storms appear to be on the horizon, but the next one that forms and attains a name will be Carlotta.","After a sluggish start to eastern Pacific hurricane season, the basin is making up for lost time.

Eric Adams,"Of the many vehicles that drove the 120 miles from Seoul to Pyeongchang for the Winter Olympics, one Hyundai stood out. Not because it runs on hydrogen, though that’s unusual enough. This Nexo crossover did the cross-country trip all on its own. And just like the athletes, the car was there to show off its skills for the crowds. Along with two just like it, plus a pair of autonomous Genesis G80 sedans, it spent the Games giving demonstration rides to fans. Those rides took passengers on a 4.3-mile loop around the Olympic Stadium, on a route that included a roundabout. That’s notable because for a fully autonomous vehicle (with a human backup in the driver’s seat), such traffic circles are beguiling. “Roundabouts have sharper turns and require both lane changing and avoiding traffic accidents simultaneously,” says Hyundai research engineer Byoungkwang Kim. They can be prim and orderly, or lawless and confusing. More than intersections governed by traffic lights or even stop signs, they require a human touch. To navigate this treacherous ring, Hyundai deployed its most advanced software controls yet, processing data from four radar units and six lidar laser sensors at the front and rear of the vehicle, along with cameras to help look for obstacles and read lane markings and signs. As the Nexo approached the roundabout, a display above the glove box indicated it was tracking all the vehicles within 100 meters, in every direction—no head on a swivel or peering at mirrors necessary. In moderate traffic, it waited until it had a large gap to make its entry, then moved with precision and at a normal speed. It stopped once, when another car threatened to enter the circle without yielding. Other bits of the drive highlighted another side of the Nexo’s skillful humanity. Hills can often mask visibility and confuse sensors if the changes are sudden—and a town hosting the Winter Olympics has plenty of hills. “The challenge was to develop lidar applicable for constant and drastic degree changes on the road driven,” Kim says. His team also programmed the car to replicate the way humans actually drive on hills—decelerating on downhill and accelerating on climbs, instead of holding the same speed with robotic vigilance. The Nexo topped out at about 30 mph on the suburban roads, but can cruise on the highway at 70 mph. Back in town, the Nexo used a 5G data connection to receive traffic light information from the local infrastructure network, easier and quicker than relying on the car’s sensors to read the signals, Kim says. The car can merge with traffic, maintain its awareness in tunnels where there’s no GPS signal, navigate toll booths, change lanes on its own, and react properly to emergency vehicles. Human traffic controllers, not so much—so when we got close to downtown, where there were many traffic cops moderating the flow of Olympic traffic, Kim took over the controls from the computer and brought us into the Hyundai demonstration lot. The 5G network connection enables another Hyundai system, Home Connect. Passengers in the rear seats can access and control devices in their residences, turning on the lights and heat or A/C before they get home, or locking the doors after they leave. It has an Alexa-like feature called Assistant Chat, as well as a health-monitoring system called Wellness Car that can monitor stress level, heart rates, and “mood,” and even set up a video call with a health consultant. For fun, it offers the karaoke application Everysing. The hydrogen-powered Nexo, Hyundai’s third-generation fuel cell vehicle, can go 370 miles between fill-ups and accelerate to 62 mph in 9.2 seconds. The non-autonomous versions of the car should appear in the Los Angeles area later this year. Hyundai expects to commercialize its self-driving tech in cities around 2021, and have it going everywhere by 2030. And everywhere has a lot of roundabouts in it.

Alex Davies,"Smash! Bang! Success! The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the arm of the Department of Transportation charged with reducing the number of Americans killed on the road, yesterday released the results of the crash test for the Tesla Model 3 : five stars in every category. The perfect score is a welcome ray of sunshine during a (tweet)stormy stretch for Tesla —just yesterday, Bloomberg reported the automaker’s supply chain manager has left the company. But it’s hardly surprising. Without an engine to work around, Tesla’s engineers can essentially make the whole front of the car a crumple zone, and having the heavy battery just inches off the ground limits the risk of rollovers. Tesla’s cars have always shown themselves to be super safe. A few years ago, the Model S proved so strong, the testing equipment broke before it did. The Model X SUV put up a perfect score in its latest exam. In NHTSA's frontal crash test, the car is hurled into a fixed barrier at 35 mph, simulating a head-on collision with another car. The test uses a dummy representing an adult male in the driver's seat, and a ""small-size adult female riding shotgun, which are evaluated for damage to the head, neck, chest, and femur. NHTSA’s testing measures how its dummies fare in four kinds of kabooms: a head on crash, getting T-boned by another car, sliding into a telephone pole, and rolling over at highway speeds. Interested consumers can also scope safety scores produced by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, or IIHS. The independent non-profit has not yet released crash ratings for the Model 3, but the 2017 Model S earned top marks in most categories. It missed out on being a “top safety pick though,” after it scored an “acceptable” on the tricky small overlap front test and its headlights were rated “poor” for providing inadequate visibility, especially on curves. Those tests are about how the car handles crashing, but new technology is making it easier than ever to avoid the crunch in the first place. That’s why NHTSA and IIHS also consider the value and performance of “active safety” features, chief among them automatic emergency braking, in which the car can sense an imminent collision, and hit the brakes on its own. Here too, Tesla performed well. The side pole crash test pits the car against a 10-inch diameter pole, which it hits at 20 mph. The dummy (in this case, a ""small-size adult female"" wearing a seat belt, is checked for damage to the the head, chest, lower spine, abdomen, and pelvis. On IIHS’s front crash prevention test, the Model 3 and Model S each scored six points of out six—good for a “Superior” rating—after successfully avoiding collisions at both 12 and 25 mph. (IIHS runs these tests separately from its more destructive crash testing, which requires five cars for any given model.) And last month, the Highway Loss Data Institute, a sister organization of the IIHS, found that Model S sedans with crash avoidance features reported fewer claims under property damage liability coverage (by 11 percent) and bodily injury liability coverage (by 21 percent) compared to older cars without the tech. And while other automakers are steadily adding these features to their cars, Tesla puts them in every vehicle it builds, standard. The question mark on Tesla’s safety resume concerns its Autopilot feature, which keeps the car in its lane and away from other vehicles in simple settings like highway driving. Critics argue it lulls drivers into thinking the system’s more capable than it is—which seems to explain why at least three drivers have smashed into stopped fire trucks at highway speeds in 2018 alone. (None suffered serious injuries, adding some credence to those crash tests.) The side barrier crash wallops the vehicle with a 3,015-pound barrier at 38.5 mph. The results are combined with those of the side pole test to yield an ""overall side star rating."" Musk insists the feature is a life-saving one, but his go-to argument relies on a dubious statistic that fails to separate the role of automatic emergency braking in preventing crashes from that of the sorta-self-driving system. (The number comes from Tesla data that shows a 40 percent drop in airbag deployments between model year 2014 and 2016 cars, after the automaker made Autopilot available with an over-the-air software update.) And when the National Transportation Safety Board started investigating an Autopilot crash that killed a California man in March, Musk got into a public dispute with the agency, arguing that critiques of the system are dangerous, for they could convince drivers to stop using a valuable safety feature. In May, Tesla said it would start releasing quarterly Autopilot safety reports. It hasn’t yet, and Tesla did not reply to a question regarding whether it would do so. But experts say the data's just not there yet to properly assess how the feature affects safety. Tesla’s problems, though, have never come from its actual cars. Apart from the occasional quality control issue, the automaker has enjoyed consistently terrific reviews from journalists and customers. We think the Model 3 is a tech-loaded blast to drive, too. Same for the Model S, same for the Model X. But that’s not enough to succeed in this brutal business, in which profit margins sit in the single digits, supply chains wrap around the world, and minor bottlenecks can prove asphyxiating. But if Tesla can get past its problems—the flight of executives, the tweet-induced lawsuits, the reported federal investigations, and the questions about production capability—it’s got the goods to be a smashing success.

Andrew Krok,"Crash tests are an important part of the vehicle development process -- after all, people aren't going to crawl over themselves to buy a car that's demonstrably unsafe. Plus, it makes for some pretty sweet visuals. Polestar announced today that it has commenced its first round of crash testing for its first car, the Polestar 1. The Polestar is unique from other Volvo-family vehicles in that its body relies on carbon-fiber reinforced polymer, in addition to the traditional steel found in most vehicle monocoques. Carbon fiber doesn't react to stress in the same way that steel does. Steel helps spread force by crumpling and bending, dissipating much of that energy before it reaches the occupants. Carbon fiber, on the other hand, isn't meant to bend -- instead, it shatters. If you've ever seen a Formula 1 crash, that's carbon fiber at work, splintering into a trillion tiny shards, guaranteeing an annoying cleanup process for the track crew. Crash tests aren't exactly simple to pull off. According to Volvo's video of the crash test, it took a full week of preparation to ensure everything was in place. Crash tests provide automakers with valuable data about how its vehicle responds to stresses, and it needs a wealth of equipment to ensure it captures all that data accurately. And the test is only the beginning -- after the car hits the wall, it's time to tear the whole thing apart and dive into the nitty-gritty. ""The outcome of this first crash test validates the decision to build the body of Polestar 1 in carbon fiber,"" said Zef van der Putten, Polestar's carbon fiber specialist, in a statement. ""It also confirms that carbon fiber supports the highest safety standards."" The crash test occurred at Volvo's safety center in Gothenburg, Sweden, and it saw the powerful plug-in hybrid hit its target at about 35 mph. Polestar began assembling prototypes of its first car in early October. When it launches, it'll be Polestar's only plug-in hybrid -- its future cars will be entirely electric. But it's one hell of a plug-in hybrid, offering some 600 horsepower with an estimated electric range of 90-ish miles, which would make it the longest-range PHEV on offer. Then again, for $155,000, it had darn well better offer some class-leading figures. Polestar 1 configurator : Can't wait until it goes on sale? Design yours today.

Kirsten Korosec,"WARR Hyperloop has done it again. The engineering students from the Technical University of Munich won SpaceX’s hyperloop pod competition on Sunday for the third time. This year, WARR Hyperloop pulled off the win when their self-propelled pod reached a top speed of more than 290 miles per hour, a new record for the competition. The pod traveled 50% faster than WARR Hyperloop’s winning entry in the previous SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition held in August 2017. In the first competition, held in January 2017, WARR’s winning pod traveled just 58 mph. That’s progress. The event was hosted, as it has since the beginning, by SpaceX and its founder Elon Musk at the company’s Hawthorne, California headquarters. The Boring Company, another Musk business pursuit, provided additional support this year. The competition this year illustrates the evolution and advancements in hyperloop technology. For instance, in the previous two Hyperloop Pod competitions, student teams had the option of accelerating their pod down the test track with support from a SpaceX-made vehicle called a “pusher.” This year, all pods had to be self-propelled. SpaceX also added another sub- competition focused on levitation technology. In this challenge the pods had to maintain alignment with the test track while hovering above it for an extended period of time. We're excited to announce that our team WARR Hyperloop is the winner of the 2018 SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition!!!!! We managed to go almost 50% faster than last year, reaching a final speed of 467 km/h (290 mph)! We'd like to sincerely thank all our sponsors! pic.twitter.com/YpPTURnHp5 — WARR Hyperloop (@WARR_Hyperloop) July 23, 2018 WARR Hyperloop was one of three teams to make it to the finals—a 1.25-kilometer Hyperloop test track adjacent to SpaceX’s headquarters. Delft University from the Netherlands and EPFLoop of Switzerland also made it to the finals. The competition accepted 20 student teams from more than 40 countries to showcase their pods at SpaceX’s third Hyperloop Pod Competition. Student teams had to demonstrate their pod’s ability to pass key tests and safety inspections. Each team’s pod also had to undergo testing inside a 26-foot long vacuum chamber and along a 150-foot long external test track built by SpaceX. SpaceX isn’t working on or connected to any of the startups currently pursuing Hyperloop technology. But Musk is still involved in supporting the idea of a system of reduced-pressure tubes that would theoretically hurtle people and packages long distances at super speeds that he proposed in a nearly 60-page public white paper back in 2013.","WARR Hyperloop has done it again.

Matt Burns,"If this is the future of hybrids, I’m all in. Volkswagen just took the cover off its Atlas Cross Sport SUV, which features a plug-in hybrid drive powertrain that features two electric motors and a V6 engine. Together, they produce 355 horsepower. And it looks great, too. The inside and out of this concept is loaded with future-leaning technology including a massive screen, digital cockpit and a seemingly endless amount of LEDs. The center infotainment system can be controlled by touch or gesture though since this example is just a concept, it’s unclear if gesture controls will make it into production. [gallery ids=""1612263,1612264,1612265,1612266,1612267,1612268""] The powertrain is the most exciting part. The Atlas Cross Sport is equipped with the same 3.6L V6 engine found in the standard Atlas. But the Cross Sport features dual electric motors with a 54 hp motor in the front and a rear motor that outputs 114 hp. An 18.0 kWh lithium-ion battery housed in the vehicle’s central tunnel powers the battery. Volkswagen says its configuration allows the output to be 355 HP, up from 310 hp if a conventional hybrid system was used. The company expects the SUV to hit 60 mph in 6.5 seconds, thus proving it’s worthy of the Sport badging as the regular Atlas runs 60 mph at 7.9 seconds. The concept features several drive modes though it’s not clear at this time if the production vehicle will have similar abilities. In E-Mode, the vehicle drives on just the rear motor and has a range of around 26 miles. Like the Chevy Volt Volkswagen says this is headed to production, too, with a 2019 release. The company’s Chattanooga, Tennessee facility will build the vehicle. This concept is built off the MQB platform that’s responsible for the seven-seat Atlas. In this variation, the vehicle is 7.5 inches shorter than the Atlas though the wheelbase is the same. It shows the flexibility of the platform, which can result in a traditional 7-seat people hauler or a 5-passenger sports SUV with different powertrains and dimensions. Volkswagen is not alone in adding hybrid powertrains to SUVs. Ford announced two weeks ago it intends to offer five hybrid SUV models in the coming years. Hybrid systems could see a resurgence in popularity as models such as the Cross Sport show they can be used for more than just increasing fuel economy.","If this is the future of hybrids, I’m all in.

Basem Wasef,"The success of any hypercar hinges on three elements: ludicrous performance, decadent looks, and abject scarcity. Nail all three and you’re on the road to automotive legend. Flub one or more, and you risk becoming a footnote of folly. So it was with some controversy that McLaren’s ambitiously named Senna debuted to skeptical supercar enthusiasts. McLaren will make just 500 street legal copies of the car, plus 75 track-only GTR models, so its rarity is ensured. Combining extreme lightweighting with a 789-horsepower twin-turbo V8 engine, performance should hold up. But in pushing the $958,966 Senna’s visual allure and versatility into the (non-existent) backseat, McLaren won itself quite a bit of backlash. The critiques came not just from the armchair enthusiasts (aka internet trolls), but from people who are actually in a position to buy the thing. “Overpriced LEGO ride for McLaren fanboys” one multiple hypercar-owning friend groused to me in an Instagram message. The hate, folks, is real. In naming this car for the late, adored Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna, McLaren made its task more difficult. McLaren’s relationship with the Brazilian phenom was hot and heavy during the 1990s, when he scored a staggering 35 F1 victories and three driver’s titles with the marque. Senna died in a crash at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, and no driver since has quite filled his Nomex boots. McLaren says this car “embodies Ayrton Senna’s values,” and it donated $2.67 million from the auction proceeds of the final Senna produced to the driver’s foundation that supports children. But coming more than two decades after Senna’s death, the link between the late man and the new machine is flimsy at best. I’ve come to Portugal to draw my own conclusions about this maligned vehicle, whose looks pose the most pressing questions. Why has the Senna’s styling—or lack thereof—been such a trigger for enthusiasts? Maybe it’s because the bodywork lacks poetry. Unlike the Italian exotics whose curves ancient Roman sculptors would recognize as beautiful, the Senna is all lines, planes, and intersecting surfaces. It’s made for the wind tunnel, not the human eye or heart. But here in the pits at the Estoril Circuit outside Lisbon, the car makes a wacky kind of visual sense. It’s unapologetically mean, a weapon suited for the apexes and straightaways on which Senna the man won his first Formula 1 race 33 years ago. Maybe it doesn’t have the swoon-inducing allure of a Lamborghini Miura of McLaren F1. Maybe it doesn’t need it. That depends though, on how it drives. Though the Senna’s doors open up and outwards, taking a section of the roof within them, it takes some wriggling to get into the thin, hollow, carbon fiber seats. After closing the door with a clunk, I acquaint myself with the moonscape of carbon fiber and Alcantara, aka synthetic suede. If you order the leather trim and soft-closing doors, you’re missing the point. McLaren painstakingly stripped away the unnecessary bits in a form of automotive asceticism. Even the door struts remain visible (you can color match them to the brake calipers). The digital instrument cluster offers a minimalist, race-oriented setup displaying key information like engine rpms and gear position. The central, 8-inch infotainment touchscreen is oriented in portrait mode to save space. Other than that, it’s all windshield and the road ahead. Purists (aka masochists) can even delete the navigation, A/C, and Bluetooth hardware in the interest of maximum minimalism. The lightweighting efforts go deeper. The Senna is built around what McLaren calls the Monocage III, which weights just 207 pounds but forms the carmaker’s strongest chassis ever. Thanks in part to those stout, slight underpinnings, the Senna is the wispiest McLaren road car since the gloried F1. The automaker’s designers and engineers replaced seemingly inconsequential metal fittings with lighter, simpler carbon bits. They moved the door latches and window switches to the roof to avoid the extra mass that comes with extended wiring. The shrunken retracting window allows for a smaller, lighter window motor. It also comes with an optional, transparent lower panel, made of Gorilla Glass that provides a sideways view of the nearby tarmac. The entire door weighs just 21 pounds, less than half of the 720S’s 55-pound portals. And let’s face it: see-through body panels are damn cool. To go with the slimmed down look, the Senna offers aggressive aerodynamics. Active front air ducts and a rear spoiler create up to 1,763.7 pounds of downforce at 155 mph, gluing the car to tarmac while cornering. The system is not only smart enough to reduce that force at more human speeds to avoid overloading the suspension and tires, it also uses steering angle and throttle position data to manage the front to rear balance of the car and avoid nosedives during hard braking. McLaren says fine-tuning the massive rear wing’s movements was the hardest part of development. The wing, which weighs only 10.8 pounds but can support more than 100 times its mass, uses hydraulic pressure from the gearbox to adjust its height and angle of attack in fractions of a second. When fine-tuning the system on the famed Nürburgring Nordschleife, McLaren engineers noted that too-sudden changes in airflow could upset the car, requiring a refined algorithm that produced the necessary downforce without destabilizing the vehicle’s delicate handling balance. The suspension is also adaptive, using McLaren’s active hydraulic system. While I’m looking around the car’s interior, a technician hooks my helmet to the harness that will keep me from snapping my neck if I crash. Another clips my five point race harness into place (my helmet-limited field of vision makes doing it myself tricky). Pro driver Andre D’Cruze sits on my right, ready to help me around the 2.599-mile track. As I exit pit lane, I realize what all the fuss is about, and what all the ligthweighting and aerodynamic work has yielded. Objectively speaking, far cheaper cars match its performance numbers. But Senna’s most alluring attributes are its featherweight construction, tenacious handling, considerable downforce, and relentless brakes. A squeeze of the accelerator yields a frisson of oversteer. “Cold tires,” D’Cruze reminds me. Just like a racecar, the Senna’s vast reserves of power must be respected before they can be exploited. I back off the gas, then gradually get back on. Each dip into the throttle produces thrust that becomes more immediate, fierce, and violent as the warmed up tires find their grip. The 4.0-liter V8 spins so eagerly with each twitch of the right foot, you wouldn’t know it’s twin-turbocharged. The thing just wants to go. For weight savings and fun havings, McLaren ditched much of the sound deadening material. Gun the throttle, and the low-pitched sound bludgeons the cockpit. The wheel feels surprisingly light through my gloved hands, whipping the Senna into each corner with precision. Approaching the end of Estoril’s half-mile straightaway at 170 mph, I stab the left pedal. The car decelerates so abruptly, I have to release the brake and regain speed going into the hard right-hand corner. McLaren, you see, incorporated the brake booster from the race-prepped P1 GTR into the Senna. It also made drastic improvements to the six-piston ventilated front discs, which now require seven months to construct. That’s seven times longer than typical carbon ceramics. On the next go around, D’Cruze suggests I wait another 100 feet before braking. I come in at 177 mph, slam on the stoppers, manage to get over the feeling of being punched in the sternum by Joe Louis, and coax the Senna through the corner. Even with my safety belts pressing my rib cage snug against the firm seats, I struggle to keep my head up as the G forces work my cervical spine into a wet noodle. While the Senna applies the brakes to each wheel independently to help rotate the car into corners, lower speed bends still require proper weight transfer techniques to load up the front tires and avoid speed-sapping understeer. I tested the Senna in Race mode, which lowers the suspension in order to enhance the active aerodynamics, but McLaren brass banned the use of the ‘Dynamic’ handling mode, which would have allowed the car greater slides. With the transmission in automatic, it’s easy to keep the car in control, as it tends to upshift earlier than I would and avoid spinning the tires. Switching to manual mode and using the steering column-mounted paddles lets me taste more of those ginormous power reserves, devouring the meatiest parts of the torque curve and triggering the occasional (controlled!) powerslide. When my track time comes to an end, it takes a moment to fully digest the Senna’s extraordinary limits. Objectively speaking, far cheaper cars match its performance numbers. The $345,300 Ferrari 488 Pista and $293,200 Porsche 911 GT2 RS equal its 0-60 mph time of 2.7 seconds. The Lamborghini Aventador S, starting under half a million dollars, goes 9 mph faster. But numbers fail to tell the complete story. The Senna’s most alluring attributes are its featherweight construction, tenacious handling, considerable downforce, and relentless brakes. All of which lend it more in common with a race car than a street legal road car, leaving concessions to comfort and convenience by the wayside. Because commoners like you and me might wonder why wealthy enthusiasts put so much money into such a car, I reach out to one Senna deposit holder whose garage is filled with hypercars from the likes of Pagani, Koenigsegg, Lamborghini, and of course, McLaren. “The motivation for me was McLaren’s desire to be LM focused,” he says in an Instagram message, referring to Le Mans-inspired race cars that prioritize handling over raw speed. “The downforce and the visibility tricks are 👍.” When it comes to those controversial looks, he admits that the car received “some rough feedback” initially. “I think it needs to be seen in the flesh to really appreciate it,” he says. But the most telling bit comes last: “Most of the noise was from people that would never buy a McLaren anyway.” And who cares what those people think? McLaren sold every last Senna.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received. The tropical Atlantic has spawned three hurricanes, but none is more worrisome than Hurricane Florence. The National Hurricane Center advisory at 11 a.m. listed Florence as a Category 3 storm, with winds of 115 mph. That’s the threshold for major hurricanes. A hurricane hunter aircraft passed through at noon, however, and found Florence had winds of 130 mph, making it a Category 4 storm. Forecasts indicate Florence will continue to undergo rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm see sustained winds increase at least 35 mph over a 24-hour period. “Further strengthening is anticipated, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday,” the National Hurricane center wrote in its Monday morning update. The unfortunate forecast is due to a few factors. All weekend, Florence had strong upper level winds that kept it from really being able to wind up. But those winds have since slackened and Florence’s structure has become much more stable from Sunday night into Monday. Weekly sea surface temperature departure from normal in the Atlantic. Image: NOAA The second big factor favoring Florence’s rapid intensification is the remarkably warm ocean. The storm is cruising over an area where ocean surface temperatures are up to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), providing more fuel to turbocharge the hurricane. Those temperatures are about 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal for this time of year. “Now that Florence has these ingredients, and is developing a ring of intense storms around its eye, it will likely continue to strengthen to a major hurricane, likely a Category 4 storm soon,” Brian Tang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Albany, told Earther shortly before the Category 3 and Category 4 updates came in. Tang pointed to Harvey, Irma, and Maria last year as examples of other rapidly intensifying hurricanes in the Atlantic. But Florence still stands out in how much it’s expected to intensify. University of Oklahoma meteorology PhD student Sam Lillo tweeted that Sunday’s Florence forecast from the National Hurricane Center called for it to be the most rapidly intensifying Atlantic storm in the past 20 years. It’s a shockingly high-confidence forecast, but one that’s based on all available lines of evidence. “Given that these models have been unanimous, cycle after cycle, in predicting Florence undergoing rapid intensification, it has given forecasters at the NHC confidence to also forecast rapid intensification,” Tang said. Research published earlier this year indicates the magnitude of rapidly intensifying Atlantic storms is on the rise. Using satellite data from 1986-2015, the researchers found that rapidly intensifying storms saw wind speeds increase 4.4 mph per decade in the eastern and central Atlantic (there was no trend in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico). The researchers attribute this to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which is marked by warm waters in the Atlantic. But they also don’t rule out a climate change, which has warmed oceans the world over. Whatever the role the AMO and climate change play in influencing Florence, the impacts of the storm will likely be acute and potentially deadly. The storm is expected to smash into the East Coast by late Thursday delivering powerful surge, winds, and torrential rains. If you live anywhere between Georgia and New Jersey, pay very close attention to the forecast in the coming days.","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received.

Andrea Valdez,"One of WIRED's biggest stories this month actually traces its genesis to a moment all the way back in August. That's when a Google engineer named James Damore published a 10-page memo criticizing what he called the company's ""left bias"" and its creation of ""a politically correct monoculture."" The missive sent a shockwave through Google, which ultimately fired Damore, and prompted much internal discussion over the company's diversity efforts. Unsurprisingly, this internal reckoning has created some deep divisions within Google, and on January 26, senior writer Nitasha Tiku spoke to 15 current Google employees who say some of their coworkers are inciting outsiders to harass Damore's critics in public forums. These Googlers, many of them de facto diversity advocates, say they have had their personal details published online and received death threats. What's more, the employees say, their colleagues have ""weaponized human resources,"" goading others into saying inflammatory things that are then reported to HR in an attempt to have people punished or fired. It all points to a larger, more foundational problem Google now finds itself grappling with. As Tiku writes in her piece, ""The complaints underscore how Google’s freewheeling workplace culture, where employees are encouraged to 'bring your whole self to work' and exchange views on internal discussion boards, has turned as polarized and toxic as the national political debate."" Tiku's story offers a rare glimpse into Google, which has long been tight-lipped and insular, as it navigates an increasingly divided landscape. Of course, WIRED covered much more than that this month. Below are January's 10 most-read stories.

Mariella Moon,"Apple's Self-Driving Car Spotted on Freeway in New Video https://t.co/or1kNbtLMy by @julipuli pic.twitter.com/nBmmWNvY7B — MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) May 22, 2017 According to a report from The Information and Consumer Affairs, there seems to be a growing trend involving autonomous vehicles getting rear-ended by human-piloted cars. Carnegie Mellon software engineer Dr. Phil Koopman said it's probably because the self-driving systems don't quite drive like human drivers. Waymo's vehicles, for instance, tend to stop before turning, crossing an/merging onto intersection, and to give way to pedestrians. Human drivers, especially those who don't always follow traffic laws, tend to speed up when they're supposed to slow down. Tech giants and automakers might have to take that into account, seeing as self-driving cars will have to drive on the same roads with human-piloted ones at first. Thankfully, nobody got hurt in the August 24th Apple crash even though both vehicles got damaged.","Apple has been keeping most of its self-driving car plans and progress under wraps, but every once in a while, we get a small peek at what the tech giant has been doing.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Look, Im as sick of typhoons and hurricanes menacing humanity as you are. Theyre planetary bullies and they suck. But I can take a begrudging moment to appreciate how they look from space. The latest storm to give me pause is Super Typhoon Tramicurrently churning in the West Pacificand images courtesy of astronaut Alex Gerst. The images, snapped from the lofty perch of the International Space Station, show crisp white clouds against a deep blue ocean, the symmetry of the eye, and the swirl of clouds within the eye itself like a world within a world. In a Facebook post, Gerst quipped that it looks like somebody pulled the planets gigantic plug. A look inside Tramis eye. Photo: Alex Gerst Trami is the most powerful storm on the face of the planet right now. On Tuesday morning, it was packing sustained winds of 149 mph and gusts up to 184 mph. Thats down a bit from its 160-mph peak on Monday and there are signs the typhoon may have weakened a bit more, but dont let that or its gorgeous appearance fool you. Trami still poses a threat to Japans southern islands later this week as it begins it turn northward. The storm could even reach Honshu, Japans most populous island, early next week. In terms of destructiveness its unlikely to rival Mangkhut, which rocked the Philippines and Hong Kong last week, but its also not what disaster-weary Japan needs after a year of torrential rains. The Western Pacific is the most active tropical cyclone basin in the world, but this year has been particularly rough. There have been more major storms than usual and accumulated cyclone energya metric that uses wind from all cyclones in a basin and adds them up over timeis also higher than the norm. Research published in 2016 shows that landfalling storms in Asia have become 12-15 percent more intense since 1970, likely driven by warmer oceans. So while its easy to admire these stunning beasts over the ocean, lets not forget theyre often still beastly at landfall. And even when theyre not at their peak, they can still cause major damage.

Sasha Lekach,"If a real Bugatti Chiron sports car will set you back $3 million, might we suggest to you this life-sized, functioning Lego version, which will only set you back 1 million (in Lego pieces). At the Grand Prix Formula 1 event in Monza, Italy, Lego unveiled a functioning sports car that looks as close to the original supercar from Bugatti as is possible when using more than 1 million Lego Technic parts, more than 2,300 Lego motors, and 4,000 gear wheels in the engine. It's just about as one-to-one as you can get with building blocks. SEE ALSO: Bugatti Chiron is $2.9 million, but the Lego version is only $350 According to Lego, the 3,300-pound car can actually take you from point A to B; a former racing driver took it for a test drive and pushed it to 12.4 mph. Not racing-fast, but still, not bad, seeing as how it's Lego-based. To put it in perspective, a legit Chiron can reach 60 mph in only 2.5 seconds and has a max speed of 260 mph. The test drive with Andy Wallace took place at the Ehra-Lessien facility in Germany, where the real Chiron was first tested. The Lego Bugatti took more than 13,000 work-hours to develop and build, and thanks to Lego's tireless efforts, a driver and passenger can comfortably sit inside the vehicle. There's even a working brake pedal and speedometer that shows how fast it's going. The car's powered by two batteries, an 80-volt for the motor and a 12-volt for the steering and electronics inside the car, so there's no revving the engine or shifting gears here — but, hey, the lights work. The life-sized car was built only a few months after Lego showed off its Bugatti Chiron building set earlier this summer. But that tiny, $350 replica didn't generate the 5.3 horsepower of its life-sized big brother — impressive, as long as you don't compare it to the real Bugatti's 1,500 horsepower.","If a real Bugatti Chiron sports car will set you back $3 million, might we suggest to you this life-sized, functioning Lego version, which will only set you back 1 million (in Lego pieces).

Rich McKay,"(Reuters) - Former subtropical storm Alberto, which threatened to clobber the southeastern United States on Memorial Day, fizzled into a subtropical depression, with winds dropping to 35 mph (56 kph) as it rolled into southern Alabama on Tuesday, officials said. At its height, it was blasting sustained winds of 65 mph (105 kph) with gusts that packed full hurricane punches of 75 mph (121 kph), said meteorologist David Roth of the National Weather Service. “It’s slowly weakening and it’s not regaining any strength,” Roth said. “The chances of it spinning off tornadoes now has dropped to virtually zero.” Forecasters had feared the storm could bring dangerous high water to southern coastal states and possible tornadoes. The National Hurricane Center canceled coastal warnings and watches. Minor power outages were reported in north Florida, and the state’s emergency response team started closing shelters on Monday, citing a “lack of public sheltering need.” Some areas on Gulf Coast barrier islands remained under evacuation orders as authorities weighed the flood risks, officials said. Alberto will probably weaken through Tuesday as it moves northward to the Tennessee Valley and then into the Ohio Valley, finally withering into a “remnant low pressure storm” by Tuesday evening, with winds around 25 mph (40 kph), Roth said. The NHC warned it would still deliver heavy, potentially damaging rains of 2 to 6 inches (6 cm to 15 cm), with chances of 12 inches (30 cm) in some spots in north Florida and Alabama through Tuesday night, possibly spurring flooding. It is expected to dump up to 6 inches (15 cm) of rain as it moves northward to lower Michigan by Wednesday evening, officials said. Alberto’s top winds weakened on Monday to 45 mph (75 kph) when its center made landfall near Panama City, Florida, weather officials said, with a city fire official adding that the wind and rain knocked down trees but did not force any rescues. Royal Dutch Shell Plc was returning workers to the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Chevron Corp restored some production on Monday after the storm’s passage. Shell plans to restore production at its Ram Powell Hub in the Viosca Knoll area of the Gulf as it soon as the platform can be operated safely, the company said in a statement. Alberto, the first named Atlantic storm of 2018, spun up days before the formal June 1 start of the hurricane season, complicating holiday travel as it hit on the last day of the Memorial Day weekend. Authorities in Florida’s Franklin and Taylor counties issued mandatory evacuation orders for thousands of coastal residents. Deadly hurricanes in the United States and the Caribbean last year caused billions of dollars in damage, massive power outages and devastation to hundreds of thousands of structures.

Lucas Matney,"Tesla made a flurry of announcements this afternoon with the highlight being the company’s reveal of its $35k Model 3. That reveal grabbed the most headlines, but updates to the Model S and Model X lines brought the costs of high-end models down with maxed out Performance + Ludicrous Mode versions of the S and X receiving healthy $18k discounts.
The Model S has the same entry-level price at $79k but the price bump to go from the Standard Range to more souped up versions is a lot more accessible with some huge price drops on the Long Range and Performance models.
The Long Range Model S, which takes the top speed from 140mph to 155 mph and the range from 270 miles to 335 miles, now prices in at $83k, down from $96k. With $4k separating the standard and long-range models, it’s interesting that they even decided to keep the Standard Range version and didn’t just have the Long Range as the entry-level model with the Performance version (now $13k cheaper as well at $99k) maxing things out.
The Long Range Model X now starts at $88k, down from $96k. Moving up to the Performance model which drops the 0-60 mph time to 3.5 seconds is $104k, previously $117k. With both Performance models of the S and X, you can add Ludicrous Mode for $15k, an upgrade that used to be $20k.
How is Tesla able to make these big cuts? Well, Tesla CEO Elon Musk highlighted the company’s coming closure of its physical dealerships as a major catalyst for the price drop across its product line.
“Shifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected,” the company wrote in a post.

Darrell Etherington,"Lucid, one of the company’s that looks like it could have the best chance to potentially field a true all-electric competitor to Tesla’s Model S, is moving its headquarters to a new facility in Newark, California – one with twice the space of its current base of operations in Menlo Park. The new headquarters is intended to give Lucid room to grow, as it prepares to launch its Lucid Air, the first car from the company. The Lucid Air is a four door sport sedan with a top speed of over 235 mph, power output equivalent to 1,000 horsepower and a target launch date of sometime in 2019. Lucid’s goal with the car is to design something that can stand on its own, instead of just matching up favorably in a comparison chart with the Model S.

Seth Godin,"There's a commuter shortcut near my house. To make it work, you need to accelerate the SUV up a really big hill, breaking the speed limit by ten or twenty mph. Then roll a stop sign, avoid a few kids walking to school and gun it on the downhill. All to save three minutes. Meanwhile, the other commuters arrive at work with their psychic energy saved for the real work. The hard work of confronting the status quo. The first shortcut is selfish. It wastes resources and engages in risk to help no one but the driver. The other work, though, is priceless. Those are the hills worth taking. [PS hint: There's another session of TMS coming up soon.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","You might want to turn the sound on. I’m not sure if lizards can experience PTSD, but if they can, I have every reason to believe this science experiment induced it. New research released on Wednesday in Nature chronicled a bizarre experiment involving lizards from Turks and Caicos, a stick, and a leaf blower. The goal? To study how hurricanes influence natural selection, of course. Last year’s brutal hurricane season took a toll on wildlife in the Caribbean, as Hurricanes Irma and Maria rattled ecosystems from the Florida Everglades to Puerto Rico’s rainforest. Researchers are still digging into how wildlife bounced back from the pounding storms, but the new research goes one step further by looking at how the storms may have left an imprint on future generations of lizards in Turks and Caicos. Scientists’ ability to tease this out involved a weird twist of academic fate. An international team of researchers had been conducting studies of populations of Anolis scriptus lizards spread across two islands. They finished their fieldwork four days before Hurricane Irma slammed into their research sites with 165-mph winds. Two weeks later, Maria plowed through the area again with 124-mph winds. That gave scientists a rare opportunity to look at whether the lizards that survived were different, on average, from the pre-storm populations. They found that the lizards who weathered the storm had bigger toepads, longer forelimbs, and shorter back legs. The researchers hypothesize that the first two qualities allowed the lizards to cling for dear life with a stronger grip than their shrimpy-limbed brethren. Meanwhile, the shorter back legs allowed them to be more aerodynamic in the hurricane-force winds, acting like a wind sock rather than a piece of sheet metal. But why just hypothesize when you can test it out, amirite? The researchers took lizards to a lab of horrors to measure what they innocuously called “performance capacity.” In this case, it meant having the lizards do their best Jim Cantore impression by having them cling to a pole while a leaf blower tossed them about in hurricane-force winds (side note: leaf blowers are no joke apparently). Amazingly, the little buggers were able to hang on, even in winds up to 108 mph. While it may look like a lizard version of Saw, the researchers stressed that no lizards were harmed—when they finally lost their grip, they flew into a nice, soft net. All of them were returned to the locations where they had been collected. Even so, there’s no way to measure the psychological trauma potentially experienced by these poor lizards. The findings are the first of their kind to measure natural selection before and after a storm. In a world where climate change is projected to make hurricanes more intense, it could mean lizards are going to have to up their tree-hugging game if they want to survive.","I’m not sure if lizards can experience PTSD, but if they can, I have every reason to believe this science experiment induced it.

Aarian Marshall,"From a parking lot in a quiet, manufacturing-dominated suburb of Los Angeles, Elon Musk and his Boring Company tonight unveiled what he believes is the future of mass transit and the best way to eliminate the scourge of traffic: electric, autonomous vehicles carrying an extra set of wheels, shooting through layers of thin tunnels at speeds up to 150 mph.
If that sounds a little fantasticalwell, duh. Musks presentation, punctuated by a glitzy entrance aboard a Tesla Model X that traveled through the company's accent-lit, now-completed, 1.4-mile test tunnel, filled in a few details about his ambitious plans to destroy LA congestion with new and improved tunnel boring processes. But the test tunnel still seems to be a test tunnel, and the Boring Company in a deeply experimental phase. A bevy of questions remain.
""I think this is, like, really a panacea,"" Musk said standing in front of the tunnel, which extends from a SpaceX parking lot into the city of Hawthorne. A panacea for a terrible ill. Traffic, he said, is like acid on the soul.
A few big elements of the Boring Companys mass transit concept, which its calling the Loop, have changed since Musk last presented it this summer. Gone are the electric skates, the platforms that were to ferry vehicles throughout an extensive tunnel network whose tendrils BoCo would like one day spread throughout the LA metro area / the world. Instead, users will now have to mount specialized wheels on their own electric, autonomous vehicles, which will guide the vehicles along the tracks in the tunnels. These look a bit like bicycle training wheels, but sit parallel to the ground:
Gone, too, is the Boring Companys 16-passenger pod concept, the centerpiece of what Musk once said was a system that would put pedestrians and cyclists first. This is a system meant to carry peoples carsas long as they are fully electric and capable of driving themselves. For those without such vehicles, Musk said, cars would continually circulate the Loop system to pick up and drop off anyone who wants a ride. Press materials provided by the Boring Company say each tunnel should one day be able to support 4,000 cars per hourabout 16,000 passengers, provided each car is nearly full. Thats the capacity of about 11.5 full (but not packed) New York City subway trains.
We are no way saying there shouldnt be other means of public transport, Musk said during the Tuesday night event. Let us do everything we can along every direction to alleviate traffic.
The technology is also far from finished. The car that traveled through the test tunnel, which the company used to give demo rides to fans and journalists, only hit speeds of around 50 mph, not 150 mph. (Musk said it was capable of traveling 110 mph.) And Musk admitted to The LA Times that the ride was bumpy, and that the Boring Company kind of ran out of time.
The bumpiness will not be there down the road, he told the Times. It will be as smooth as glass. This is just a prototype. Thats why it's just a little rough around the edges.
Hawthornes city council allowed the company to fast track through the environmental review process because it's a demonstration project, not a functional form of mass transit, and because the city concluded its construction wouldnt disturb neighbors. Musk says the company digs so deeply beneath the earth that its tunneling isnt perceptible from above and rightly notes tunnels are safe in earthquake-prone spots like LA. BoCo spent just under two years and $10 million building this test tunnel.
Musk tweeted the Boring Company into existence in December 2016, when he cracked a joke about being so frustrated by LA traffic that he would buy a tunnel boring machine and just start digging. By early 2017, there was an honest-to-God hole in the SpaceX parking lot, the beginnings of the test track that the company unveiled today. Musk has argued that cities like LA can only quash traffic by going 3D down or 3D up, and that flying cars (that would be up) are too dangerous.
Thus, his vision: layers of underground road carrying hundreds of thousands of vehicles traveling at high speeds, transported into the netherworld by thousands of elevators woven throughout the sprawling city. (Musk likened system to ""wormholes"".) Boring has said it will charge riders $1 each, will finance this vision itself, and wont accept government funds.
Transportation engineers and urban planners have criticized the plan, which they argue does not address the underlying causes of traffic, like bottlenecks at highway on- and off-ramps (or the elevator entrances and exits where cars will enter the system) and urban sprawl. The plan faces another foe: the public environmental review process, which can sometimes take over a decade for an infrastructure project of this ambition.
To pull this off, Musk has acknowledged that he will have to bring down the cost of digging tunnels and speed up the processdramatically. Eventually, Musk has said, he would like his modified boring machine to beat his pet snail, Gary, in a race, increasing the standard boring pace by a factor of 14. (Professional tunnel engineers have publicly cast doubt on whether Musks innovations are possible. Also, the original Gary is long dead. BoCo now cares after Gary VI.) He has also said his tunnels reduced widthabout 12 feet at their widestwill also bring down costs.
Musk also announced last summer that the soil unearthed by his tunneling efforts would be repurposed into bricks, which will be sold through another Muskian spinoff, The Brick Store LLC. The bricks have already been used to build a Monty Python and The Holy Grail-type tower on the grounds of SpaceXs headquarters. BoCo has also promised to release life-size LEGO sets.
The Boring Company has also popped up all over the country. Theres this test tunnel, in Hawthorne, and the companys plan to build a small system running between one of three LA Metro subway stations to Dodger Stadium. (Musk told reporters Tuesday that he would like to build out the entire LA system by 2028, when the city will host the Olympics.)
Boring has also promised a DC to Baltimore connection, but hasnt received all the permits needed to make that project truly go. Plus, theres a high-speed connection between downtown Chicago and OHare International Airport, which Musk has promised to build for no more than $1 billion, a pittance for a major infrastructure project. Boring is reportedly in the midst of an environmental review process there. (That project, which had been championed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, may face political challenges now that Emanuel is leaving office.)
One project thats no longer on the Boring Companys list: another test tunnel in West Los Angeles. BoCo pulled out of that project after settling a lawsuit with two local neighborhood groups, which argued the company was attempting to circumvent city rules by getting a metro-wide project appealed piecemeal.
So yes, its been a long and confusing road to this point. Musk has proposed a raft of ideas associated with his tunneling. Many have been questionable, but most have been exciting, if for nothing but their originality. But maybe this meandering is the way to the future. Its certainly the way of Musk, a man whos never been much for the traditional, stodgy way of doing things, where you mull over a plan, announce it in a carefully worded press release, then spend the next few years executing it just like you said you would. Some CEOs wear suits and sit in the backs of limos. Others emerge from tunnels in rumpled flannel. You decide which group make better showmenand which change how things really work.

Nicole Lee,"If you're a little worried about handing over the keys to your Tesla to a valet, then you might be tempted to engage the car's ""Valet Mode,"" which limits the speed of the car to 70MPH and tops out the power and acceleration to just 25 percent. But that also locks out the glove compartment and the trunk, and access to certain vehicle settings will be disabled. Now, however, Tesla's latest software update will now let you adjust the top speed of your car with a specific speed limiter feature, and directly from your mobile app. According to the update, this speed limiter feature will let you ""limit vehicle speed and acceleration with speed limit mode"" and that the maximum vehicle speed can be set between 50 to 90 mph. So if you're concerned about little Timmy Junior putting the pedal to metal but you don't want to go full Valet Mode on him, then this might be a good way to control the speeds without locking him out of the rest of the car's features, for example. There are other companies that allow a similar Valet Mode feature. Corvette, for example, has one that locks down your infotainment system, but also has a Performance Data Recorder tech that apparently records what's going on in your car while someone else is driving it, which is legally problematic in some states. Tesla's Valet Mode, however, supposedly doesn't have such a recording feature. The software update for the speed limiter mode is rolling out starting today, and will gradually be available to the whole fleet.","If you're a little worried about handing over the keys to your Tesla to a valet, then you might be tempted to engage the car's ""Valet Mode,"" which limits the speed of the car to 70MPH and tops out the power and acceleration to just 25 percent.

Jake Holmes,"If you need to travel 3 mph faster than you could in your current Bentayga, the Speed is for you.
Bentley
The Bentley Bentayga is getting sportier still with the introduction of a new Speed model. Like all prior Bentley Speed models -- e.g., the Continental GT Speed -- it's ludicrously powerful and fast. Specifically, Bentley says the luxury SUV will sprint to 62 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds and top out at 190 mph. That's 0.2 second quicker and 3 mph faster than the regular Bentayga.
Bentley is also keen to point out that speed figure, translated from 306 kilometers per hour, makes the Bentayga Speed the fastest production SUV you can buy today. It just barely pips the Lamborghini Urus, which has its terminal velocity quoted at 305 km/h -- or so close that there's essentially no difference between the two. But, hey, bragging rights are bragging rights.
Providing all that performance is a reworked version of the Bentayga's 6.0-liter twin-turbo W12 engine, in this case dishing up 626 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque, the former an increase of 26 hp over the existing Bentayga W12. It's also an 84-hp gain over the available Bentayga V8. The SUV's Sport mode has been retuned, Bentley says, for better throttle responses, sportier exhaust sounds and a firmer ride from the Bentley Dynamic Ride active anti-roll system.
A big SUV traveling at 190 mph needs a lot of stopping power, so the Bentayga Speed is available with carbon-ceramic discs that Bentley claims are the largest on any production car. They were tested to withstand temperatures up to 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit and save 44.1 pounds versus the standard stoppers. The brakes hide behind 10-spoke 22-inch wheels.
Bentley designers restyled the Bentayga for Speed duty with a bigger roof spoiler, tinted headlights, darkened exterior trim pieces and subtle ""Speed"" badges. The cabin features Alcantara trim and illuminated ""Sport"" door-sill plates, though as with any Bentley, customers can personalize the cabin to their liking. No pricing has been announced for the Speed just yet, but based on past experience with the Continental GT Speed, it'll be a pretty penny.",The 626-hp SUV is the latest in Bentley's extremely powerful Speed range.,2019-02-14T17:25:57Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Bentley Bentayga Speed claims fastest SUV crown at 190 mph - Roadshow,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/bentley-bentayga-speed-suv-revealed/,https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/eMBOw2wtbxdwWy9mY4DEFdWiKL4=/2019/02/14/67e9ade2-b3a4-4737-a5ec-a2452832c59c/bentley-bentayga-speed-ogi.jpg,,Cnet.com,mph,1
Darrell Etherington,"As a transportation reporter, I’ve been in a lot of cars using either autonomous or semi-automated Advanced Driver Assistance (ADAS) features, both on public and private roads, and yet I’d never been in an accident during a demonstration drive for any of these features before now. On Tuesday, January 30, myself and two TechCrunch video production staff were riding in a modified Hyundai Genesis equipped with technology created by autonomous systems startup Phantom AI, traveling south on Bayshore Freeway near Millbrae, CA. In addition to the three TechCrunch staff, there were also two Phantom AI team members in the car, including founder and CEO Hyunggi Cho, and President and co-founder Chan Kyu Lee. Lee was at the wheel during the test, which was a demonstration of the startup’s Autopilot-like SAE Level 2 partial autonomous system, designed to maintain lane position, maintain distance between itself and vehicles ahead, and switch lanes automatically once directed using the turning indicator. During the demonstration, while the L2 system was engaged and we were traveling at 60 MPH according to Phantom (though the human-machine interface in the video above shows 70 MPH as our set cruising speed), a pickup truck ahead dropped a poorly secured garbage bin from its cargo bed onto the roadway. The car in front, a white Nissan Rogue, applied the breaks to prevent hitting the trash bin, and our driver noticed the sudden stop and applied the brake in the Genesis with force to attempt to prevent a collision, but there was very little he could do at that stage and our car collided with the Nissan going approximately 20 MPH. The Genesis suffered significant damage to the front end, as you can see above, though it was still technically drivable (but did begin leaking radiator fluid) and we first pulled to the shoulder as instructed by the California Highway Patrol, who were on the scene nearly immediately. We were then directed by the Patrol to a Chevron station just beyond a nearby exit, where we parked on the shoulder of a turnaround and gave our contact information to a patrolman, while the drivers involved provided full statements to the authorities. Cho told us that the Automatic Emergency Braking system would’ve normally engaged at that point and prevented the collision, but it was disabled for the demo because it had been throwing too many false positives and was undergoing tuning. Lee’s manual disengagement, which resulted from pressing the brake pedal to the floor, as you can see in the video, didn’t occur fast enough for us to shed all our speed. Cho immediately made sure no one was hurt (we weren’t, just shaken up) and after being cleared to leave the scene, we decided to follow through and move to an area of Foster City, where we rode in the startup’s Level 4 autonomous test car (a separate Genesis) around sparsely populated residential streets without incident. That may seem like an odd choice given we’d just experienced an accident riding in a car equipped with a different version of the company’s technology, but the follow-up demo was a separate system, speeds were much lower and there was a different safety driver at the wheel, and we were also honestly just all a little rattled and confused following the collision. We provided Phantom AI with the opportunity to supply a full account of what occurred from their perspective, based on reviewing the data from the vehicle, and they supplied a breakdown of what occurred from their perspective, which you can read in full below. The video at the top of this article also documents the crash from within the vehicle, using a Rylo 360-degree camera. Footage was trimmed for length and exported to 1080P frames from a 4K 360-degree source automatically using Rylo’s software, and the license plate of the vehicle hit was obscured for privacy, but otherwise the footage is unedited. We were conducting a demo of the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) feature, and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) feature of our L2 system. Our Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) functionality was disabled for demo purpose. For a frame of reference we’ll use the moment of impact at t, and express the time line in t minus x seconds. t minus 6: 50m apart from the front car; our car was cruising at 60MPH with L2’s Cruise Control feature active t minus 6: A trash can from the pickup truck 2 or 3 cars apart started flying off the trunk t minus 5: Our driver realized that something was up as the car in front abruptly decelerates t minus 4 to t minus 3: Our driver began taking over the L2 system; braking started and our L2 system was disengaged (can be clearly seen in the HMI display) t minus 3 to t: Braking was applied as strong as possible, with braking force : 5~6m/s^2 (you can see from the speedometer we went from 60MPH -&gt; 25MPH for 3 seconds). As you can see the driver was doing everything he could within these 3 seconds, expecting an impact. t minus 0: impact at ~20MPH So our driver could’ve clearly had a slightly faster reaction time, applied brake 1-1.5 seconds earlier, and braked harder since the maximum possible braking of a vehicle is about 8m/s^2. But at that instant since he had you, a reporter in the car, he was clearly overwhelmed and the anxiety caused the slight delay in reaction time for decision making. In hindsight we should’ve enabled our emergency braking functionality, as this would’ve been a rare opportunity to test/demonstrate our automated braking system which would’ve braked harder than the human driver. What happened was an unfortunate minor incident that we had a human driving error which had we enabled our full system, could have been avoided.","As a transportation reporter, I’ve been in a lot of cars using either autonomous or semi-automated Advanced Driver Assistance (ADAS) features, both on public and private roads, and yet I’d never been in an accident during a demonstration drive for any of thes…",2018-02-01T15:37:46Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",We were in an accident during an automated driving tech demo,http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/01/we-were-in-an-accident-during-an-automated-driving-tech-demo/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/image-uploaded-from-ios-2.jpg,techcrunch,TechCrunch,mph,1

SEE ALSO: Tesla unveils its monster Tesla Semi truck and lets us step inside Arriving in 2020, and, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, designed to “give a hardcore smack-down to gasoline cars,” the new all-electric Roadster will have world-record-beating specs.

The gleaming red car literally rolled out of the back of one of the Tesla Semi Truck’s cargo bays. It then proceeded to race up and down the runway at insane or what Musk is now calling, “Plaid” speeds.

Image: Tesla To illustrate the massive range, Musk pointed out that Roadster drivers could manage a trip from LA to San Francisco, then back to LA — all without recharging. The car will offer all-wheel drive, and it's a four-seater. This is no conventional luxury car. It has a base price of $200,000 — more than $100,000 over the base price of the Tesla Model S. The ""Founder"" series will be a run of 1,000 vehicles that cost $250,000 or more. To reserve a ""regular"" model, it'll cost you a $50,000 deposit, and reservations are open now. Want the Founder model? That'll cost you the full $250,000 up front. Silicon Valley millionaires better start lining up now. And they probably will, even though there are as yet no details on exactly what perks that model will have.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The sun isnt up on Hurricane Willa, but its clear the storm is a monster. GIF: Colorado State University It was a nice two weeks of quiet in the tropics, wasnt it? Unfortunately, that quiet is over. Over the weekend, Hurricane Willa rapidly intensified into a Category 4 beast thats beelining for the Mexican coast. It will bring fierce winds, powerful surf, and rains that could trigger landslides. Willa has unfortunately followed the Hurricane Michael playbook. The storm was named on Saturday morning, and then got to work rapidly intensifying. The textbook definition for rapid intensification is a storm that sees sustained winds increase at least 35 mph over 24 hours, a criteria Willa has met and then some. Its winds jumped from 40 mph to 100 mph between Saturday and Sunday morning and kept ramping up to 155 mph by Sunday evening. That puts it a hair below Category 5 strength. On Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned that slight strengthening is possible today, and Willa could become a Category 5 hurricane later this morning. Willa could weaken a bit as it nears land on Thursday afternoon or evening, which is a welcome deviation from the Michael playbook. But regardless, the storm will still be formidable. A hurricane warning extends for 175 miles along the Mexican coast from the city of Mazatlan to San Blas. Tropical storm warnings stretch even further north and south across the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Nayarit. In addition to powerful winds, the storm will also bring torrential rain. The NHC calls for a wide area of 6-12 inches of rain with up to 18 inches possible. That could cause flash floods and landslides. The inland desert will also see up to 6 inches of rain, but the smaller amounts in a dry landscape could still lead to dangerous flash flooding, too. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, the NHC warned. Willa is the Eastern Pacifics 23rd named storm of the year. Thats well above the average of roughly 16 for this time of year. Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), a measure that factors in how powerful and long-lasting storms are, is also pretty bonkers. As of this morning, the ACE value for the Eastern Pacific stood at 302.5, nearly two-and-a-half times higher than normal for this time of year. A burgeoning El Niño has likely given a boost to the season owing to the warm water and weaker upper level winds in the eastern tropical Pacific. Climate change has also warmed the oceans, another key ingredient for helping hurricanes spin up and sustain themselves. Some research has suggested future warming could make Category 4 and 5 storms more common in the region, though it remains an active area of study.","It was a nice two weeks of quiet in the tropics, wasn’t it?

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Your humble Earther weather correspondent went the roof of Gizmodo Media’s offices to capture the above picture. By the time he descended to the ground floor, all hell had broken loose. Powerful winds made umbrellas abstract sculptures of plastic, metal, and fabric. And that’s too bad for their owners, as torrential rains turned city streets into rivers as lightning forked across the sky and the National Weather Service New York office urged residents to “SEEK SHELTER NOW inside a sturdy structure and stay away from windows.” Which is why I am holed up in our offices (far from windows of course!) writing this blog instead of heading home. So, what the hell happened on a day that started sunny and stayed that way until 15 minutes before the gates of hell appeared over Midtown? If you’re a Twitter user, you’ve probably seen the term derecho thrown around today, as well as on Monday when the Washington, D.C. region was buffeted by powerful storms and the president drove through an area under a freaking tornado warning (pro tip: do not do this even if you’re leader of the free world). A derecho is basically a powerful windstorm that moves in a straight line unlike tornadoes, which spin in a tight area, or hurricanes, which spin over a much larger area. Making things even more confusing: some derechos can come with tornadoes. So, was this a derecho? Well, it’s complicated. The pattern of wild weather began this morning. Those same sunny skies helped heat the land up, while winds from the south drew even more hot, humid air into the region. Temperatures peaked in the upper 80s in New York and 90s further south. A cap of stable air in the atmosphere allowed all that heat to build up, a setup that Capital Weather Gang wrote this morning would help “rapidly destabilize the atmosphere this afternoon.” We saw that start in central Pennsylvania, where the powerful series of thunderstorms built into the afternoon before lumbering toward the I-95 corridor. Along the way, they dropped hail the size of baseballs and left a wake of lightning that looks like an open wound across Pennsylvania. The storms then plowed into New York right at rush hour. I didn’t have an anemometer on the roof of Gizmodo Media HQ, but I feel safe saying it was windy as fuck. Video showed gusts swirling water out of a rooftop pool. And wind gusts have already hit 40 mph in Massachusetts, which is next in line to get hammered. Forecasts indicate winds could top out at 70 mph in some locations. So yes, storm bad. But derecho bad? According to the Storm Prediction Center, “by the present definition, derecho winds must meet the National Weather Service criterion for severe wind gusts (greater than 57 mph) at most points along the storm path.” They also have to widespread. So far, at least, this storm hasn’t met the official derecho criteria. But you should still exercise extreme caution, avoid driving on flooded roadways, and stay away from rooftops and other areas that could expose you to lightning.","Your humble Earther weather correspondent went the roof of Gizmodo Media’s offices to capture the above picture.

Sasha Lekach,"Jaguar is joining the revolution with its first all-electric vehicle coming out later this year. The Jaguar I-PACE made its public debut at the Geneva Motor Show earlier this week, and car lovers everywhere are already freaking out. The vehicle has a 90-kilowatt battery that powers the engine for up to 240 miles (only slightly less than the 295-mile range of the Tesla Model X.) The I-PACE will be shown at the New York International Auto Show later this month and will be available in the U.S. during the second half of this year. The new vehicle joins the PACE series, a family of SUVs including the smaller E-PACE and SUV sports car F-PACE. SEE ALSO: Volkswagen's I.D. Vizzion concept is a self-driving, electric dream car Also revealed Tuesday was the pricing for the four-door battery-powered vehicle: $69,500 to start. Compare this to the Tesla electric SUV, the Model X, which starts around $82,000. The I-PACE boasts 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds. The Tesla equivalent used to take 6 seconds and was upgraded to 4.9 seconds, but reaches a top speed of 130 mph, while the I-PACE only makes it to 124.

""Id like to believe that you were minutes away from creating an unspeakable Christmas tragedy when I stopped you.

Alex Davies,"Over the past few years, the global auto industry has come to something of a two-part consensus: First, the future of driving involves running on electrons, not exploding petroleum. Second, the best way to package those electrons is in the kind of vehicle people really want: an SUV. Audi has the E-tron, Jaguar the iPace. Cadillac is leading General Motors electrification scheme with an SUV. Porsche just announced its small SUV, the Macan, will soon come with a battery. And as you might guess from those company names, these vehicles do not come cheap.
Polestar has a different approach. Volvos electric- and performance-based brand today unveiled the Polestar 2, which makes a point of not being a luxury SUV. They already have enough coming, CEO Thomas Ingenlath says of customers who want the pricey, hulking things. His team has spent more than three years working on a midsize, five-door fastback, a sedan-like design for a vehicle aimed not exclusively at the fancy. A car that has a lot in common with the one Elon Musk has been busy building.
Along with a zero to 62 mph time under five seconds, the Polestar 2 offers 11-inch center screen running Google Android software.
As the oh-so-creative name indicates, this is Polestars second vehicle, though the Polestar 1 functioned more like a proof-of-concept for the relaunched brand: It was a hybrid rather than full-electric, was based on an old Volvo concept, and cost $155,000more than an Audi R8. This new EV is meant to be the brands proper first car: all-electric and original.
On the spec front, the Polestar 2 holds its own. Pulling power from a 78-kWh battery, the two motors produce more than 400 horsepower and nearly 500 pound-feet of torque. They can get the car to 62 mph in less than five seconds and take it 275 miles between charging stops. Inside, you get an 11-inch center screen that runs on Google Android software, which should make for a more pleasant user experience compared to most automakers native systems.
The Polestar 2 now starts at $63,000, and in about a year, Polestar aims to have a version available for $45,420. Even thats a luxury price point, but add in a $7,500 federal credit and rebates from various states, and the cost of the car can drop closer to $30,000still not cheap, but far below the Audi and Jaguar EVs that start around $70,000.
When you look at its price, specs, and size, you see that the Polestar 2 has one obvious competitor: the Tesla Model 3. Elon Musks car for the masses currently starts around $42,000 and beats the Polestar by a bit on acceleration and range. But while you could call Polestar a Tesla-fighter, the electric space is become rather crowded. So its a Jaguar-, Audi-, Mercedes-, BMW-, and more-fighter, too.

The Mantis Q weighs 1 pound and can be folded to fit into a backpack, making it ideal for families and casual photographers. The drone has three automatic flight modes: “journey mode,” which flies on a straight, designated path; “point of interest,” which circles an assigned object; and “return to home,” which automatically returns the drone near its takeoff area. The Mantis Q is supposed to be able to recognize faces from up to 13 feet away and can take photos either through gesture control mode if the user waves their hand, or through a voice command like, “Take a selfie.” Image: Yuneec Yuneec’s offered the cheaper Breeze 4K since 2016, but it costs $400, only has a flight time of 12 minutes, and doesn’t come with voice controls.

Imad Khan,"It seems that the NHTSA has some safety concerns. ""Using a non-compliant test vehicle to transport children is irresponsible, inappropriate, and in direct violation of the terms of Transdev's approved test project,"" NHTSA Deputy Administrator Heidi King said in a press release. Earlier this March, NHTSA approved Transdev to test and demonstrate its autonomous shuttles. NHTSA claims the agreement never included actually transporting children as if it were a school bus and Transdev did not receive permission to do so. The NHTSA claims that regular yellow school buses go through ""rigorous"" standards to ensure kids are safe. Either way, it took the NHTSA over a month to respond. Transdev announced its plans in early September, and even released a upbeat orchestra-backed launch trailer showcasing its vision of the future. While the shuttles are autonomous, it doesn't mean it's unmanned. A safety operator is on board while students are riding to ensure smooth operation. Top speed for the shuttle is currently 8 MPH. There were plans to push speed further, but that might be in limbo now. And Transdev isn't the only company experimenting with futuristic school buses. Both Daimler and Google have announced plans for electric, WiFi clad buses as well. Since NHTSA's cease and desist, Transdev has not commented on Twitter or put out a press release in response to the action.","Sorry kids, neither you nor robots can be trusted.

Rhett Allain,"The Parker Solar Probe just earned the title of the fastest-moving manmade object. Launched by NASA this past August, this robotic spacecraft is currently very, very near the Sun, on its way to probe the outer corona of our local star. OK, I know you have questions. Let me just jump right into it. How fast is it going? According to NASA, its current speed is 153,545 mph (or 68.6 kilometers per second). But really, that just means super fast. It's nearly impossible to imagine something that fast when the fastest man-made stuff on Earth is perhaps a rail gun projectile at about 2.52 km/s. That means the Parker Solar Probe is traveling at a speed that is 27 times faster that the fastest thing we've got down here. Zoom fast. What does this have to do with the speed of light? Of course, light is even faster. Light has a speed of about 3 x 10 8 m/s (300,000 km/s). But why does that matter? You can't get an object up to (or greater than) the speed of light. Why? Let's start with an example. Suppose I have a force of 1 Newton and I push on an object at rest with a mass of 1 kg for 1 second (I'm using easy numbers). The momentum principle says that the momentum is the product of mass and velocity. Also, the force applied to an object tells us the rate of change of momentum. This means a 1 Newton force for 1 second gives a CHANGE in momentum of 1 kg*m/s (the change part is important). This mostly works for super high speeds. The momentum principle still works as long as you use a better definition of momentum. It should look like this (in one dimension). In this expression, the p is momentum (don't ask why) and the c represents the speed of light. Notice that as the velocity gets closer to the speed of light, you get a much smaller increase in speed for the same force. In fact, if the velocity was equal to the speed of light you would be dividing by zerowhich is generally a bad thing. Just to be clear, there aren't two models for momentum. You can always use the more complicated version of momentum. Try this: Calculate the momentum of a baseball with a mass of 0.142 kg and a speed of 35 m/s. First do this with the simple formula of mass times velocity and you get 497 kg*m/s. Now try it with the more complicated formula. Guess what? You get the same thing. I recommend using the simple formula whenever possible. Just how fast is the Parker Solar Probe going compared to the speed of light? If you divide the probe's speed by the speed of light you get 0.00023. Actually, we can write this as 0.00023c (where c is the speed of light). It's fast, but it's not light-speed fast. Why is this speed relative to the Sun? You will probably see something about the speed of the Parker Solar Probe labeled as the heliocentric velocity. What's the deal with that? On Earth, this is rarely an issue. If you are driving your car at 55 mph, everyone understands that we are measuring this velocity with respect to the stationary ground. In fact, velocities only really make sense when measured relative to some reference frame. On the Earth, the obvious reference frame is the ground. What if you didn't want to use the Earth's surface as a reference frame? Imagine a police officer pulling you over in your car and saying ""oh hello, I clocked you at 67,055 mph."" That could indeed be true since the Earth isn't stationary. In order to orbit the Sun, it has to travel with a speed of 67,000 mph to make it all the way around the Sun in one year. Yes, that's fast (with respect to the Sun). If you wanted to measure the speed of the Parker Solar Probe with respect to the Earth, you would have a tough time because you wouldn't just have one value. As the probe moves closer to the Sun, the probe and the Earth can be moving in different directions. So even though the speed relative to the Sun could stay constant, its speed relative to the Earth would change since the Earth is turning in its orbit around the Sun. If you really want to get crazy, you could use some other reference framelike the galactic center. But let's not get crazy. How does the probe break its own speed record? The probe will go even faster than it is already traveling. NASA projects a slightly faster speed as it gets closer to the Sun in 2024. But why does it get faster when it is closer to the Sun? There are two key ideas here. The first is the gravitational force. This is an attractive force between the Sun and the probe. The magnitude of this force increases as the distance between them decreases. Oh, don't worryyou can't notice an increase in gravitational force as you move closer to the ground. Even if you moved a vertical distance of 1000 meters, this is insignificant compared to the size of the Earth with a radius of 6.37 million meters. The other part of the problem is circular motion. Imagine the space probe traveling in a circular orbit (which isn't actually true). In order for an object to move in a circle, there needs to be a force pulling it towards the center of the circle. The magnitude of this sideways force is proportional to the square of the object's velocity, but inversely proportional to the radius of the circle. Putting the gravitational force and the required circular force together, I get the following expression for the orbital velocity. In this expression, M s is the mass of the Sun and G is the gravitational constant. But the main point is that the velocity increases as the radius decreases. It's just physics. Homework If you want some fun physics homework questions, I have you covered. Here you go. Calculate the kinetic energy of the Parker Solar Probe at its current velocity (with respect to the Sun). Yes, you need to look up or estimate the mass of the probe. Suppose you were going to get the probe up to speed by having a human on a stationary bike connected to a generator. The human can produce 50 Watts for as long as you like (maybe it's two humans who take turns). How long would it take to get the probe up to its current speed? The probe has been in space for about 3 months (let's go with 3 months). Suppose that the probe was traveling at a constant speed this whole time (use its current velocity). Create a plot of speed vs. time as measured relative to the Earth. Remember, in 3 months the Earth changes direction. How many candy bars would the probe need to ""eat"" to get to its current speed. Yes, I'm assuming the probe eats. This might be useful too. More Great WIRED Stories","The probe just broke the record to become the fastest human-made object, relative to the sun.

Matt Burns,"General Motors is spinning up its electrification plans and today announced the stunning, poorly-named Buick Enspire concept at Auto China 2018. As a concepts go, this one looks great and rather feasible. GM says its powered by Buick’s eMotion powertrain that can produce a maximum output of 410 kW (roughly 550 hp). This should make it good for a 4 second sprint to 60 mph. Range is clocked at 370 miles and the battery can be recharged to 80 percent within 40 minutes. It supports both fast and wireless charging. The 2018 Buick Enspire all-electric concept SUV Inside is an augmented reality windshield, OLED display and wood center console. And since this is just a concept and nothing is real, the Enspire features a 5G connection. GM made a big promise in 2017 to release 20 electric vehicles within the next five years. The company is going all-in on electric vehicles and something like this Buick would fit nicely in the world of crossovers and mild SUVs. I think it looks better than the Tesla Model X, but of course, the Model X is real and this is just a concept. The Envision was announced in China where the Buick nameplate is well-loved. It will be interesting to see if GM releases this sharp SUV under a different brand though. To me, throw a new grill on it, drop the dumb name and that SUV could be the future of Chevy.

Megan Rose Dickey,"For those of you keeping track of the scooter saga in San Francisco, Supervisor Aaron Peskin has filed a resolution in opposition of California State Assembly bill 2989. The bill, authored by Assembly Member Heath Flora and sponsored by electric scooter startup Bird, seeks to increase the speed limit of electric scooters from 15 to 20 mph, increase the wattage to 250 to 750, let people ride them on sidewalks and only require minors to wear helmets. San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors and the Municipal Transportation Agency are actively creating a permitting process to better regulate scooters. The intent is to ensure “sensible, regulatory frameworks,” Peskin said earlier this week. In legislative meetings earlier this week, members of the public and supervisors expressed concerns pertaining to people operating scooters on sidewalks, as well as people riding them without helmets. This bill, introduced back in February, would essentially enable the opposite of what San Francisco envisions. “While San Francisco policymakers pursue common sense regulation of standup electronic scooters to enhance the public benefit of this new shared mobility technology and to reduce potential harm to the public, state legislators seek to eliminate elements of the Vehicle Code that exist to protect the health and safety of members of the public including users of standup electric scooters,” Peskin wrote in his resolution.

Eric Adams,"Honda has built a reputation by keeping its feet on the ground. Even when it ventures into the water to add outboard motors to its collection of cars, trucks, lawn mowers, and motorcycles, Honda’s known for efficient, economical, and reliable machines. But the company is reaching into the stratosphere (or something near it) with the the $4.9 million HondaJet. The business jet (basically a less lavish private plane) entered service in earnest this year after two decades of fastidious, often-delayed development. Honda’s pristine new assembly line in Greensboro, North Carolina is steadily approaching full capacity, when it will build up to eight jets a month. A business jet might seem outside the scope of Honda’s core mission, but the challenge of cracking a competitive market with an innovative new product is nothing new for the company. So far, the HondaJet seems to pack enough classic Honda practical engineering prowess to impress the general aviation community. Efficient aerodynamics, high speed (nearly 500 mph), a novel engine configuration, and relative low cost tend to do that. The HondaJet is the second cheapest business jet on the market, after the Cirrus Vision Jet, and for many it’s a right-sized option for transporting six or seven people without relying on commercial airlines. Furthermore, it has proven easy and fun to fly thanks to its compact size and its agility, rare qualities in non-fighter jets. For a better look at how Honda builds the jet, we explored the Greensboro factory, and even took a joyride in a finished product.

Connie Loizos,"It sometimes reads like a terrible love story, the relationship between Consumer Reports and electric car company Tesla. Consumer Reports withholds its affection, Tesla addresses its errant ways, and not long afterward, the two come happily come together until the next car review. We saw this happen in late 2015, when Consumer Reports assigned Tesla’s Model S a “ worse-than-average ” rating in an annual report about the predicted reliability of new vehicles, knocking down the company’s share price by more than 10 percent in one day. Later, the car was re-instated by Consumer Reports as a top-rated ultra-luxury sedan after it updated its software to include automatic emergency braking at highway speeds. Something similar happened today. As you may have seen, Consumer Reports last week withheld its recommendation to buy Tesla’s more compact luxury car, the Model 3, after its testers “found flaws—big flaws—such as long stopping distances in our emergency braking test and difficult-to-use controls.” Specifically, the outlet reported, the car’s stopping distance of 152 feet from 60 miles per hour was “far worse than any contemporary car” it has tested and “about seven feet longer than the stopping distance of a Ford F-150 full-sized pickup,” which weighs about 7,000 pounds. (The Model 3 weighs roughly half that amount.) Tesla told Consumer Reports that its own testing had found stopping distances from 60 mph to 0 mph were on average 133 feet. Still, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also jumped on the phone with Consumer Reports’s head of auto testing to share information that Tesla had discovered about its braking system and to say the carmaker had an over-the-air software update in the works to address it. The update was since completed and shipped and now, Consumer Reports is both confirming that Tesla managed to improve the car’s braking distance by 20 feet, and it says it’s giving the Model 3 its highly sought-after recommendation — even while it hopes Tesla will also do more to improve the car’s center-mounted touch controls, which its testers worry are difficult to use while driving. It’s easy to characterize the whole thing as some sort of routine dance between reviewer and reviewee, but it’s a much bigger deal than that, insists Consumer Reports, which has been reviewing products for 82 years and remains a powerful force, even while its influence has waned somewhat in the era of anonymous online reviews. Indeed, the outlet notes in its newest review of the car that, until now, remote improvement to a car’s basic functionality on such a meaningful scale as Tesla just pulled off was “unheard of.” That kind of observation clearly pleases Musk, who launched a tirade against the media last week but today is praising Consumer Reports for its “high quality critical feedback.” He also says that more improvements are coming.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","We’re still a few weeks out from the official start of hurricane season, but tropical cyclones don’t care much for regulation. That’s why there’s a small chance one could spin up off the Florida Panhandle this week. A large, low pressure area filled with clouds and thunderstorms has developed across the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and it’s marching slowly northward toward the west coast of Florida. As it moves across warm Gulf waters and gathers strength over the next 48 hours, it has about a 30 percent chance of getting organized into a cyclone. Over the next five days, those odds rise to 40 percent, according to the National Weather Service. Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther that in all likelihood, any cyclone that does form would be classified a tropical or subtropical depression, with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph or less. But, he added, there’s a “small chance” of a named tropical or subtropical storm, one featuring wind speeds of 39—73 mph. “I wouldn’t rule it out, it’s just on the lower side of the probabilities,” Henson said, noting that water temperatures are a bit marginal right now. Regardless of how fierce the storm gets, Floridians are going to feel it. The entire Florida Peninsula could be in for heavy rainfall this week, with eastern Florida around Kennedy Space Center expected to see up to seven inches of precipitation. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing—central and South Florida are coming off a particularly dry dry season, with more than 30 percent of the state in moderate to severe drought as of May 8. “This will slowly alleviate some of the drought conditions,” Henson said, adding that there’s also some concern about localized flash flooding. Predicted rainfall totals for 7-day period ending on May 20. Image: National Weather Service The system has already brought record rainfall to the Florida Keys. By yesterday evening, Key West had notched 3.24 inches of precipitation—more than double the previous May 13 record in logs going back to 1871. On the off chance that the Gulf of Mexico does get a named storm this week, that’d be pretty special. Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach told Earther via email that since 1851, only four named storms have formed in the Gulf of Mexico in May. The last one was in 1976.","We’re still a few weeks out from the official start of hurricane season, but tropical cyclones don’t care much for regulation.

USA TODAY A Tesla that the driver said was in Autopilot mode struck a parked police vehicle in Laguna Beach, Calif. (Photo: Laguna Beach Police Department) SAN FRANCISCO — Tesla's innovative and controversial Autopilot software — which powers the partially self-driving features of its electric cars — is most often used for highway driving, according to the initial findings of an MIT study using volunteer owners. The research, shared at a conference in Cambridge, Mass. Wednesday, came a day after the latest crash of a Tesla using Autopilot, and as two consumer groups renewed criticism of the software's name and marketing, which they say dangerously misleads drivers. Launched in 2015, the software Tesla CEO Elon Musk once said could be ""safer than humans"" is receiving more scrutiny as the number of Teslas on the road increase and other automakers unveil their own, partially autonomous vehicles. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in on-going study of 34 Tesla owners who volunteered for the project, found Autopilot is used 36% of the time by drivers in the test group of 22 cars (some are owned by couples). ""That it's actually being used quite often by most drivers jibes with what Musk has said,"" Bryan Reimer, research scientist in the MIT AgeLab and associate director of MIT's New England University Transportation Center, told USA TODAY. Drivers are most likely to use it for highway-speed driving, with the next biggest cluster between 25 and 45 miles per hour, Reimer said in an address Wednesday to the New England Motor Press Association's annual tech conference.

(In more extreme cases, they film themselves while the car drives itself.) Reimer says that interviews with the test group's Tesla owners, who will be studied for the coming year, show a ""glaring gap"" in the understanding of such technology. That confusion may well have played a role in some of the recent crashes involving Teslas on Autopilot. The latest one happened Tuesday in Laguna Beach, Calif., where a Model S hit and totaled a parked, but empty, police car. In an earlier Utah crash, the driver — who sustained only a broken ankle after hitting a stopped fire truck at 60 mph — was looking at her phone and disengaged from driving for 80 seconds before impact. In March, the driver of a Model X died after his Autopilot-enabled car steered into a highway divider in Mountain View, Calif. A Tesla sedan with a semi-autonomous Autopilot feature rear-ended a fire department truck at 60 mph (97 kph) apparently without braking before impact on May 11, 2018, but police say it's unknown if the Autopilot feature was engaged. (Photo: South Jordan Police Department/AP) In each case, Tesla has responded by reminding consumers that the system is not meant to turn the vehicle into a self-driving car and that it requires constant driver oversight. But Musk's enthusiastic forecast for the capabilities of Autopilot, as well as its name, often override those admonitions, say two consumer groups. Consumer Watchdog and the Center for Auto Safety held a press conference in Los Angeles Wednesday to urge state and federal regulators to push Tesla to rename Autopilot and possibly require that it be tested further. ""People relying on Tesla (Autopilot) are getting killed, and that's what we're trying to stop,"" said John Simpson, privacy and technology project director at Consumer Watchdog, which has been dogging Tesla for years. Simpson said the two groups are urging the California Department of Motor Vehicles officials to investigate how the electric automaker's claims about the technology match up to Autopilot's reality. Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said that the consumer groups also are asking the Federal Trade Commission to look into what they call ""dangerously misleading and deceptive marketing practices"" associated with Autopilot. ""Tesla has captured the imagination of the buying public with car pitched directly to consumers by a celebrity CEO,"" Levine said. ""But the software and hardware (of Autopilot, which uses radar and cameras to scan the road ahead) needs to be improved, or the name has to be changed. These recent deaths should give politicians pause."" Tesla founder Elon Musk presenting the new Roadster electric sports vehicle (on background), presented to media on Nov. 16, 2017 at Tesla's Los Angeles design center. Tesla says the Roadster will accelerate from 0-60 mph in less than two seconds. Tesla says the new Roadster will cost $200,000 and will be released in three years. (Photo: /TESLA HANDOUT VIA EPA-EFE) One of the trickiest aspects of semi-self-driving cars involves the moment when a situation requires handing control back to the driver, also known as the ""handoff."" Automakers from Tesla to Nissan to Cadillac have used different kinds of feedback to force the driver to re-engage with the vehicle once this driver-assist tech is deployed. In the MIT study, of the nearly 20,000 studied Autopilot ""disengagements"" — when control was handed back to drivers — a scant 0.5% were initiated by the car, with humans taking over for reasons ranging from planned maneuvers to complex road scenarios. Nissan’s ProPILOT Assist technology, which is paving the way for future fully autonomous vehicles, is aimed at reducing the hassle of stop-and-go driving by helping control acceleration, braking and steering during single-lane highway driving. But drivers must constantly oversee the system, Nissan says. (Photo: Nissan, Wieck) That result suggests this particular test group does not seem to be abusing the system, which would trigger various warnings to take back control of the vehicle. The general public has been fascinated when it comes to the coming age of self-driving cars, a future heralded by some of technology's biggest names. But this effort took a hit in March when an Uber autonomous car killed a pedestrian in Arizona and led to the company pulling out of the statewide testing. Just how much confusion exists is hammered home by a finding from an MIT AgeLab survey question that asked respondents: ""To your awareness, are self-driving vehicles available for purchase today?"" Nearly 23% said yes. But there are no self-driving vehicles are available for purchase today; only cars with semi-autonomous features such as Autopilot. ""As I mentioned,"" says Reimer, ""there's a lot of confusion out there."" Follow USA TODAY tech writer Marco della Cava on Twitter.

Mark Kaufman,"On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast for the looming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, and it'll be an active one. Forecasters say that there's a 70 percent chance that the season will be active with hurricanes, but it's unlikely that we'll see the extremes of 2017, when six major storms (which have sustained destructive winds of at least 111 mph ) roared through the Atlantic. ""Last year was extremely active,"" Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in an interview. ""It was one of the strongest seasons on record."" SEE ALSO: Fighting climate change could save the world trillions of dollars This coming year, NOAA's analysis of long-term climate trends in the Atlantic Ocean, the temperature of the ocean, and other factors, don't add up to conditions that would stoke an extreme hurricane season. ""Right now we're not seeing any strong climate signals that say the season would be as strong as last year,"" said Bell. But, NOAA is seeing the signal for a season that is either ""normal"" or ""above normal."" There's just a 25 percent chance that the season will be ""below normal."" Image: Noaa For perspective, the rare 2017 season saw 17 named storms (winds higher than 39 mph), six of which were major hurricanes of Category 3 or above, like hurricane Harvey and Irma last year. Bell said that a ""normal"" season would be 10 to 12 named storms, with five to six total hurricanes, one or two of which would be major, devastating cyclones (think Hurricane Harvey or Irma). There's a reasonable chance, about 35 percent, that these storm numbers and intensities could be punched up a little more, however, and enter the ""above normal"" spectrum. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, though Bell notes the peak of the season is in August, September, and October. For this reason, NOAA will produce an updated forecast in early August. These are the names NOAA will use to name storms during this hurricane season. Image: NOAA The 2018 season begins as many areas are still reeling from the 2017 pummeling. Recovering from Hurricane Harvey alone has a price tag that exceeds $125 billion, according to NOAA. Puerto Rico is still in the process of recovering from Hurricane Maria, with more than 14,000 people still without power on the island, according to an ABC report. There are some 80 million Americans that live in hurricane territory, notes Bell, so he hopes people start preparing. This means getting flood insurance, having an evacuation plan, downloading the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) app, and heeding warnings. Since 1995, the Atlantic has experienced a high amount of hurricane activity said Bell, in large part due to a decades-long climate trend occurring in Atlantic, called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), in which warmer waters produce stronger storms. Some studies also suggest that as human-caused climate change worsens, extreme weather events could become more frequent and severe.","On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast for the looming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, and it'll be an active one.

Mat Smith,"Surprise! Tesla's new Roadster will be the fastest production car ever - in 2020 At last night's big Semi event, Elon Musk and Tesla had a special surprise, a prototype of the company's next Roadster. A follow-up to its original EV, the new car is a four-seater with a removable roof, a 200kWh battery capable of going 620 miles, and incredible performance specs. With a claimed 0 - 60 MPH time of 1.9 seconds, 8.9 second quarter mile and top speed of over 250 MPH, Musk claims it will be the fastest production car ever. The only problem? It's not coming out until 2020, and getting in line for a pre-order will cost $50k of the $200,000 base price, or $250,000 up front for a limited ""Founders Edition"" model. Keep on truckin'. Meet the Tesla Semi Tesla also showed off its Semi, an all-electric big rig with a 500 mile range, plus Enhanced Autopilot technology.

Associated Press,"(BIG WELLS, Texas) — At least five people were killed and several others hurt Sunday as an SUV carrying more than a dozen people during a suspected “smuggling event” crashed while fleeing from Border Patrol agents in South Texas, authorities said. The SUV carrying 14 people went out of control at more than 100 mph and overturned on Texas Highway 85, ejecting most of the occupants, Dimmit County Sheriff Marion Boyd said. “From what we can tell the vehicle ran off the road and caught gravel and then tried to recorrect,” Boyd said, adding that “caused the vehicle to turn over several times.” Four victims were dead at the scene, Boyd said. He said at least one and possibly two others died at a hospital. The Border Patrol said in a statement Sunday night that two other vehicles had been traveling alongside the SUV earlier in the day. An agent suspected they were conducting a “smuggling event,” according to the statement, which did not elaborate. The border agent stopped one of the vehicles and another agent stopped a second one. Multiple people from both vehicles were arrested. The third vehicle kept going when agents encountered it, and a sheriff’s deputy took over the chase prior to the fatal crash, the border patrol said. The incident comes amid heightened tensions over the treatment of immigrants at the southern border. The Trump administration has said tougher immigration policies — even separating children from their parents — are needed to deter immigrants from coming to the country illegally. Over a six-week period ending in May, about 2,000 children had been separated from their families, administration officials said Friday. Most of the occupants in the SUV were believed in the country without legal permission. Boyd said the driver and one passenger were believed to be U.S. citizens. The driver was among those hospitalized, and a deputy who assisted the Border Patrol with the chase found the driver sitting upright in his seat and took him and the passenger into custody. “This, I think, is a perfect example, of why are borders need to be secured,” Boyd said. Some injured were taken by helicopter to San Antonio, about 90 miles (144.83 kilometers) northeast. Dimmit County is directly north of Webb County and east of Maverick County, which border Mexico. “Our deepest sympathies go out to the families of those who died in the crash,” The Border Patrol said in the statement.",The vehicle went out of control at more than 100 mph and overturned,2018-06-18T01:17:36Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Five Dead After a Border Control Chase Ends With a Crash in South Texas,http://time.com/5314481/five-dead-texas-border-patrol-chase/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/ap18168793929032.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,mph,1

This week the German carmaker's head of electric vehicles revealed more about its charging capabilities and the company's plans to take on Tesla. SEE ALSO: Porsche and Audi take on Tesla with two gorgeous electric car visions Stefan Weckbach told Ars Technica the electric car is still very much a Porsche even if things look a bit different under the hood. ""The entire company is working towards a single goal: with Mission E, we will offer a fully electric Porsche, which is a perfect fit for our brand, finds approval with our customers, and rightfully bears the name 'Porsche.'"" In Autoblog, Weckbach added, ""Porsche is unlikely to lower itself to gimmicks of this kind or use sound effects"" to imitate the sounds of a engine-powered vehicle instead of an ion battery. It's embracing its electric status. Tesla claims its Model S can go from 0 to 62 mph in under 3 seconds in Ludicrous mode. Weckbach says the stat has problems, and Porsche been critical of Tesla's claims before. Instead Weckbach says it's more important to focus on ""reproducible performance and a top speed which can be maintained for long periods."" Porsche claims the Mission E will accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in under 3.5 seconds. A look at Porsche's Tesla competitor. Image: porsche An 800-volt super charger means a short charging time — 15 minutes for 250 more miles. The quick charge is dubbed ""turbo-charging."" The Mission E can go about 300 miles on a full single charge. It can still charge at a 400-volt station, which is the typical charging capacity, though it'll take a bit longer. The four-door car will also wirelessly charge in special charging garages with a coil installed in the floor. The Porsche will inductively charge over the coil. The electric car will also be part of a growing Porsche charging network that's trying to rival Tesla infrastructure. Charging stations are slated to go up at its 189 American Porsche dealerships.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The countrys midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota. So if you live in that area, listen up!
The mayhem is already beginning as moisture streams from the Pacific into the Southwest, where winter storm warnings are in effect as of Tuesday afternoon. Up to two feet of snow could fall in New Mexicos Sangre de Cristo Mountains, accompanied by winds whipping across ridge tops at speeds of up to 75 mph, according to the National Weather Service. That alone would be pretty wild, but its only a precursor to Wednesdays weather mayhem.
As the storm pushes inland, its pressurewhich drops as storms get strongeris expected to dip into the range of 970 millibars. Thats roughly on par with an average Category 2 Atlantic hurricane and could challenge the all-time low pressure record for Kansas. The drop will be driven by the storms winds as they wrap around its core in a counter clockwise direction, bringing moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico in contact with cold air from the Upper Midwest and Canada. The movement of the winds is called cyclonic, and pressure is expected to drop more than 24 millibars in 24 hours, which means this storm is shaping up to fulfill the criteria for a rare inland bomb cyclone. It could even take on a hurricane-like appearance.
The fascinating thing about this storm is how quickly it will intensify and the possible record-low pressures it will produce in the Plains, Jason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther. Another neat thing is that some models are indicating that this storm will strengthen so quickly, it could develop an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. This is a very rare for non-tropical systems and even more so for storms in the central U.S. (Its also rare for noreasters, which tend to be more comma-shaped.)
Weather geekery aside, the storm is going to make a mess of things. The area facing wind gusts up to 60 mphthe equivalent of a mature tropical stormstretches for more than 1,000 miles from Sturgis, South Dakota to the Texas-Mexico border. For comparison, the reach of Sandys tropical storm-force winds was 1,150 miles from edge to edge, although even thats not a perfect comparison, since tropical storm winds start at 39 mph.
So about those winds. The most intense blasts could rip up to 75 mph in the Rockies and Southern Plains. The rotation of the storm will also create what Furtado called a moisture pipeline straight out of the Gulf of Mexico. That means not only will it be windy, but also snowy. The National Weather Service is forecasting up to a foot or more of snow from Colorado to the Dakotas. Blizzard warnings are also in effect for large part of the region, and they could expand as the storm begins its onslaught.
Even after the storm clears out on Wednesday night, its impacts could linger. Aside from the heavy, blowing snow, areas on the Southern Plains could see wind-driven rain that could melt out what snowpack there is, aided by a blast of warm air on Thursday. Ed Vallee, the founder of Empire Weather, told Earther that flooding and melting snowpack is another unique impact could happen after the storm blows out into the Atlantic.","The country’s midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Florence has done something strange. The Category 4 storm — which is expected to make landfall somewhere in the Southeastern U.S. on early Friday morning as a major hurricane — has broken with a 170-year long history of Atlantic hurricanes to now target the United States. Since 1851, there have been 33 named-storms that churned within 100 miles of Florence's position in the middle of the Atlantic. None of them, according to a tweet from hurricane scientist Phil Klotzbach, ever made landfall in the U.S. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is on its way to the East Coast. Here's what to expect. But some unusual weather is steering Florence westward, straight into the U.S. ""All its friends of years gone by have all been going to the north, while this one is going to the west,"" Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said in an interview. 33 named storms (since 1851) have been within 100 miles of #Florence 's current position. None of these storms made US landfall. The closest approach was #Hurricane George (1950) - the highlighted track. However, Florence does not appear to be taking a climatological track. pic.twitter.com/4x02pasgPg — Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) September 7, 2018 Specifically, a potent mass of high pressure over the Atlantic has blocked Florence from traveling north, away from the U.S. ""Usually storms that are located there are already recurving toward the north,"" said McNoldy. ""This an anomalous storm."" Coming back to life Last Thursday, Florence had lost its status as a hurricane, weakening to a tropical storm, which has sustained maximum winds speeds of less than 74 mph. ""It weakened significantly,"" said McNoldy. The storm passed through an area of powerful wind shear — winds that hit storms at their sides, and weaken a hurricane's strength. But as meteorologists predicted, Florence made it through this temporary threat. ""As soon as it got out of that [shear] it began to regain strength,"" said McNoldy. ""There's nothing to inhibit it now."" What's more, hurricanes feed off of warmer ocean waters, and Florence has now entered an area of the Atlantic with waters that are typically warm enough to support a hurricane. But right now, these already-warm waters are even warmer than usual, noted McNoldy. The ocean temperatures Florence will pass through will peak near 85 degrees Fahrenheit, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. ""That certainly doesn't help the situation,"" McNoldy said. The end result is that the NHC forecasts a powerful, destructive storm hitting the Southeastern U.S. early Friday with intense wind speeds of 145 mph, which are then expected to fall to around 85 mph after moving inland. But from there, the situation will likely grow worse. There are no influential weather systems, like the high-pressure system that steered Florence toward the U.S. in the first place, to keep it moving along. This portends heavy rainfall and flooding as the storm stalls over the area. ""That's actually what happened last year for Hurricane Harvey,"" said McNoldy, noting that Harvey stagnated over Houston and dropped historic rainfall on southeastern Texas, becoming the second-most costly hurricane in U.S. history. As for Florence in the Southeastern U.S., ""It could remain in place for the entire weekend,"" said McNoldy.",Hurricane Florence has done something strange.

Heather Dockray,"Something as simple as booking a flight can be painful if you identify as trans. 
On Tuesday, United Airlines announced that they would be changing their booking options to be more trans-inclusive. Instead of forcing their customers to choose between male or female as gender options when booking, customers can now also select U (undisclosed) or X (unspecified), corresponding with whatever it says on their identification. Customers can also select ""Mx."" in lieu of Ms., Mrs., or Mr. when booking and in their customer profiles.
SEE ALSO: Flying 1,300 mph on airplanes would be great. But future aviation has other plans.
""United is determined to lead the industry in LGBT inclusivity, and we are so proud to be the first U.S. airline to offer these inclusive booking options for our customers,"" United's Chief Customer Officer Toby Enqvist said in a press release.
United partnered with the Trevor Project, a nonprofit that provides suicide prevention and crisis intervention services to LGBTQ individuals, as well as the Human Rights Campaign, one of the largest LGTBQ nonprofits in the country, to devise the program. Company employees also learned about preferred pronouns and how to create a more trans-inclusive workplace.
United Airlines' shift comes after a series of embarrassing incidents for the company, including a customer who was dragged off an airplane to make room for an employee who wanted to fly and a dog who was killed after a flight attendant stuffed his carrier into an overhead bin.

Michael Calore,"The lane of oncoming traffic ahead of me is clear, so I use one hand to spin the wheel to the left and point the hood of the car up Pescadero Creek road. My other hand is cradling the white cue ball that tops the stick shift, and as I tighten my grip, I push the stick forward and away to put the car into third gear. I back out the clutch and press the accelerator—really, just giving it a little nudge—and my passenger and I go leapfrogging straight up the hill, the exhaust popping and burping behind us. The mighty Brraapp comes rippling up through the back of the car and swats our ears in the same way a wet, low B-flat from the sousaphone in a New Orleans brass band rattles you when you’re standing a little too close but you don’t care because you’re so lost in the heat and the booze and the rhythm. I push down harder toward the floor and suddenly we’re doing 54 mph straight up the hill. It’s exhilarating. I shift again, to fourth gear. With each new slot, the pitch of the exhaust goes up and down as the engine speed automatically adjusts to match the new choice of gearing. With the release of the clutch comes another explosion of decibels. Braaaaaah. Suddenly we’re pushing 70. I giggle and say it again, the word I’ve been muttering like a mantra ever since I took the wheel 20 minutes ago, the word that defines this vehicle, the word that should be stamped onto the vanity plate at the factory: Silly. Chase Me The beast I’m driving is the 2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt. It’s a special version of the Mustang that Ford developed and brought to market to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the film Bullit. In that movie—if you remember, and I know you do—there’s a famous car chase scene where the good guy (Steve McQueen) drives a green 1968 Mustang fastback as he chases the bad guys’ black Dodge Charger up and down the hills of San Francisco. It’s easily the most beloved car chase in Hollywood history. When audiences saw it in the fall of 1968, it made the young Mustang—then just four years old but already a hit—even more desirable, masculine, and sexy. Never mind Steve McQueen. The original Bullitt Mustang. This car, the 2019 Bullitt edition, takes all the greasy DNA of the fetishized original and folds it into a modern Detroit chassis. On paper, the $46,595 Bullitt Mustang is not far removed from Ford’s recent Premium GT model Mustang. It’s got a 5-liter V8 with 480 horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque. Top speed is a silly 163 mph. The rev-matching manual transmission has six speeds, and shifting between them is as easy as reciting the alphabet. The performance-tuned suspension is borrowed from the Mustang GT, and the Brembo brakes are painted red so you can see them poking out from behind the front rims. In the dash is a B&amp;O sound system and the Mustang’s brand new all-digital instrument cluster. The car is shaped, of course, like a fastback. Silllly. Just like the ‘68 McQueenmobile, this Mustang comes in “dark highland green” (or straight black, but why would you ever choose that?) and is adorned with choice bits of Bullitt bunting. The film’s logotype-in-crosshairs logo sits at the center of the steering wheel, on the passenger-side dash, and on the dummy “gascap” on the rear where the Mustang badge would normally go. Then of course there’s that white cueball stickshift knob, just like the one in the vehicle that was driven in the movie. When I first walked around the car, I thought all the Bullitt badging felt a bit thirsty, but if you’re buying a Mustang, you really do need to advertise that your Mustang is more rare, more beastly, more obnoxious, and more silly than the all other Mustangs. So be it. Note the green accents in the interior, the Bullitt logo on the wheel, and the white cue ball on the stick shift. Sound Transport I take the Bullitt over the ridge and down to the ocean, where we’ll turn north and run up Pacific Coast Highway. I find some stretches of road where I can just cruise, and I lift my hand off the cue ball to test some of the settings. The only one I’m really interested in fiddling with is the exhaust mode selector. The nasty trumpeting I’ve been spraying all over the northern California hills for the last hour is the result of “Normal” mode. I switch it to “Quiet.” It really is quiet. The car’s bite on the road isn’t lessened one bit, but the air feels suddenly neutered, as if one of the world’s great orators has ceded the podium to a prim accountant who begins reciting quarterly earnings statements. I flip the selector up two notches to “Sport” mode. The foul bark comes back, deeper and stronger. Dare I try “Track” mode? I dare. What a woof! I could be considerate of the kind folks enjoying their lunchtime buffets in their cozy homes tucked among the vineyards as we go wheeling past. But no. This is Bullitt. This is American might. Listen to my engine! I purposefully let each gear rev higher than I should before up-shifting just to get the eardrums buzzing. I implore my passenger to say it with me: Silly, silly, silly. Soon, we are surrounded by minivans and Priuses as we ride tight, afternoon traffic all the way up through Half Moon Bay and into San Francisco. Sadly, this will be the Bullitt experience for most buyers—a modest 42 mph with plenty of red lights. But even when it’s stuck the pen, the Mustang can smell the open prairies. I can steal three lengths from just about anyone off the line at a green light, and I make a game of it, doing it again and again. Because that’s what bucketloads of horsepower and torque are for. It’s addictive. Even in traffic, I can’t stop giggling. Mechanical Music At dusk, Ford corrals the assembled journalists into a cocktail reception at a resort north of San Francisco. Naturally, the bourbon at the open bar is Bulleit. I spend some time chatting with the Ford company reps, all of whom are thrilled to be here, driving this car on the very streets that made it famous. We watch scenes from the 1968 film, we play Bullitt trivia games, we race Bullitt slot cars, and we shoot pool using a custom cue ball with the six-speed transmission mapped on it. We talk about the Mustangs of our youth. I tell them how I learned to drive behind the wheel of my parents’ 1988 Mustang GT convertible, which makes us all smile. When I ask the Ford guys about the differences between this Bullitt Mustang and the other current Mustangs, they rattle off a few stats but ultimately settle on one point: The key thing this car offers is a visceral experience different from what you get in other Mustangs. When you roll down the window and hear the engine kicking, when you feel the exhaust note curl up the small of your back, when you look down and see that cue ball, you’re getting something wholly unique. It’s fresh and rare and you can’t replicate it in any other car. The original ‘68 fastback, which has its own vibe, doesn't come close. The souped-up Mustang GT doesn’t take you there either. The Bullitt is its own singular and delicious brand of silly.

Patrick Allan,"You step into a street you thought was empty—then you hear it. A car is careening toward you, tires squealing as the driver slams on the breaks. You have less than a second to react and save your life. Here’s what you do. Plane travel is incredibly safe—your odds of dying on a commercial flight are about one in 11… Read more Read Before we get into it, know that your survivability when being hit by any vehicle greatly depends on the speed of that vehicle. If they’re going fast enough— 45 mph or more —you won’t have time to react, and the blunt force will be too great for any human bone structure to overcome. That said, there’s no harm in trying to dodge a speeding car headed your way. The trick is to lift, leap, protect, and roll. The most important thing, according to professional stuntwoman Tammie Baird, is that you try to get up on the hood of the car. Otherwise, you’ll bounce off the bumper or grill and back into the road—where you’ll land hard on the asphalt, and possibly be flattened onto it. So, lift the leg closest to the car, so there’s absolutely no weight on it. This positioning will ensure you get swooped up instead of knocked down, says Baird. Once you’re in a lifted leg stance, it’s time to leap. Propel yourself up with your weight-bearing leg so your butt or hip lands on the hood of the car first. As you come down on the vehicle’s hood, bring your arms and hands up to protect your head. If possible, spread yourself out as you hit the hood to reduce the force of impact. After that, it’s time to roll. Prepare for the momentum of the car to either roll you up onto the windshield and over the vehicle, or roll you back down the hood of the car because they’ve stopped. Whichever direction you go, don’t stop protecting your head. Remember: lift, leap, protect, and roll. When you’ve stopped moving, get up immediately if you’re able to. You don’t want to stay in the street and risk being hit again. Ask the driver to stay there (note their plates and take photos of the car anyway), call the police to report the incident, then go directly to a hospital. Just because you don’t feel any pain right then doesn’t mean you’re not hurt. Don’t let the adrenaline rush fool you. Seek medical attention and get yourself thoroughly checked out.","You step into a street you thought was empty—then you hear it.

Makena Kelly,"Finding your way through an airport can be an infuriating task. With cancellations, delays, and gate switches, you could find yourself running in circles forever before you board. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines wants to help make that jaunt from security to your gate a little less hectic with a little blue robot. The robot, Care-E, will meet you at the security checkpoint and take you wherever you need to go with your carry-on luggage on its back. To start your trip with the robot, it will prompt you to scan your boarding pass through nonverbal sounds and cues on its screen. KLM will launch the device at New York’s JFK and San Francisco’s International airports before the company decides if it will provide the service elsewhere. Care-E moves at around 3 mph, so if you’re running late and need to dash through the terminal to catch your flight, you may want to leave it at the security checkpoint. But if you’re early, you can use it for free with a two-day demo trial. KLM expects the robot guide to launch in either July or August, but you may be checking for delays on your phone for a little while longer, as the device isn’t fully functional yet. Smaller companies have tried to develop a smart airport device like Care-E but have repeatedly failed and fallen out of business due to airport policy changes on batteries and working out those kinks with relatively small teams.

Boyd added that it's possible a sixth passenger may have also died in the hospital. The wrecked vehicle was one of three that the Border Patrol suspected was involved in a ""smuggling event,"" according to the AP. Agents managed to stop the other two vehicles and arrest several passengers who Boyd claimed were in the country illegally. Officials said the driver of the SUV is a U.S. citizen. He was unharmed in the crash and was able to walk away from the vehicle, according to Boyd. He was arrested by Homeland Security. Boyd blamed the porous border for the deadly tragedies that plague counties neighboring Mexico.

Aarian Marshall,"Here at WIRED Transportation, we love a good, fast car: nimble, corner-hugging, fast as hell, shiny as all get out. This week was not supposed to be about those. We were ready to go all in on trucks, the lumbering elephants of the highway animal kingdom. There was, of course, last night’s glitzy Tesla Semi reveal —our own Alex Davies jetted down to the Tesla Design Studio in LA County to spend some time with the ultra-powerful, four-motor beast, which gets 500 miles per charge. Jack Stewart, meanwhile, checked out other happenings in the electric truck/saving-the-world sector and discovered all sorts of companies arguing that electric motors are better for shipping than the old school diesel kind. And now that Musk has trumpeted his truck’s autonomous features and startup Embark is using semiautonomous trucks to deliver fridges, I took a look at the future of truck driving jobs. And then it all went to pot, because Elon Musk rolled a new $200,000 Tesla Roadster out of the back of his new Semi in a puff of smoke, and everyone lost their goshdang minds. This week was a lot. Let’s get you caught up. Headlines Stories you might have missed from WIRED this week Tesla sure knows how to (re)design a vehicle. Sure, the new Semi features four motors and can go from zero to 60 mph in five seconds while hauling 80,000 pounds. But Alex saw a company designing for humans too, with thoughtful cab tweaks that should make it easier for humans to drive. At least until the company nails that autopilot thing. About that Tesla Roadster 2.0 : Musk says it goes 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds, with a max speed of 250 mph, making this one of the fastest surprises ever. Also possibly one of the fastest production cars in the world. Lest you think Tesla’s having all the fun, Jack checked out a little trumpeted but pretty cool project at the Port of Los Angeles, where Siemens is powering three electric trucks with overhead wire, like streetcars. Other companies experiment with trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells, while still more race to build batteries powerful enough, fast-charging enough, and light enough to power a long-haul trip. Alex reports on the startup Embark, which has been using semiautonomous trucks to haul refrigerators between a warehouse in Texas and a distribution center in California since last month. Today there’s a safety driver behind the wheel, but Embark wants to eventually let the vehicles go human-free on highways. Truck drivers will still be needed, to guide them through their last few tricky miles over surface streets. In fact, a bunch of those working on automated trucks insist they’ll still need truck drivers, at least for the next few decades. These jobs will change, though; I explore how. If your vehicle tastes run more toward fire engines, I hung out with the San Francisco Fire Department’s newest truck, a slightly smaller (but still red) vehicle built to make streets safer for cyclists and walkers alike. WIRED Transportation’s Inspirational Quote of the Week “When you wish upon a falling star, your dreams can come true. Unless it's really a meteor hurtling to the Earth which will destroy all life.

It’s the third lawsuit alleging racial discrimination brought against the carmaker by a black worker this year—and the first to seek class-action status. Meanwhile, General Motors is upping the electric ante. CEO Mary Barra said this week that the carmaker will profit off its EVs in four years, thanks to expected battery price drops. Today, the Chevy Bolt’s batteries cost about $145 per kilowatt-hour; Barra says they should hit $100 per kilowatt-hour by 2021. Volkswagen’s going all-in on electric—and China. The German automaker hooked up with Chinese state-owned company Anhui Jianghuai to make EVs in the spring, and now says it will spend $12 billion by 2025 to introduce 40 locally produced, low-emission vehicle models. Oh, Canada! Lyft makes it first foray into international markets—and the Great White North—with an announcement that it will launch service in Toronto by the end of the year. (Uber already operates there.) In the Rearview Essential stories from WIRED’s canon. More Musk, you say? Check out WIRED's 2012 interview with the inventor.

Adrienne So,"Many of my car journeys are within a mile of my house, hauling toddlers and groceries to and fro. It would be much easier, more fun, and better for the environment, if I could replace at least a few of those trips with an electric cargo bike. However, a few hurdles stand in my way. The first is cost. I loved the versatility and power of the R&amp;M Load, but at $7,000, it costs as much as my current car. Going completely carless would justify the price, but it’s hard to make the commitment. I don’t know what my mom would say if I picked her up at the airport and strapped her into a cargo box to ride home. But I can picture her face, and it’s not pretty. The second is convenience. Yuba, Riese &amp; Müller, and other e-cargo bike manufacturers only sell through preferred retailers. Since I live in a city that is positively infested with high-end bike shops, I find picking up an electric cargo bike to be a simple, if time-consuming, task. But for many others, stopping by a shop and riding your new bike home is a lot harder. If Yuba's preferred retailers aren’t in your city, you might be stuck taking a train and biking 50, or 100, miles back home. Animation by Rad Power Bikes Seattle’s Rad Power Bikes operates on the principle that everyone who wants an electric bike should be able to get one. The RadWagon, their e-cargo offering, starts at $1,599. It costs only a fraction more than a decent road bike. And since they’re direct-to-consumer, they will deliver a bike directly to your door. In terms of price and convenience, Rad Power Bikes already have the competition beat. Now it just remained to see if the bike itself was worth it. Built to Spill Rad Power asked if I wanted to assemble the bike or have it assembled for me. For an additional $199, Rad Power offers full assembly through a mobile bike shop called velofix, if you live within an area that velofix serves. But since the whole point was that anyone, anywhere, can order a Rad Power bike, I opted to put mine together myself. As I soon realized, bike building is a skill, performed in workshops by trained professionals with a set of specialized tools. I'm a card-carrying member of the Gadget Lab, and I have an outsized sense of my ability to assemble almost anything. However, that turned out to be mostly hubris. For three days, I spread the contents of the enormous box on several mats on my deck, snatched bags of screws back from my toddlers, and watched videos on YouTube. Eventually, I caved and begged my spouse to let me rummage around in his tool shed. While Rad Power does provide you with the tools that you need to assemble the RadWagon, you are much better off if you have access to a set of ratcheting hex keys and a torque wrench to measure how hard to tighten individual screws. I confess to still feeling slightly nervous every time I go over a large bump and hear a spring jiggling. If it's an option, I recommend getting the bike professionally built. Having an Ikea bookshelf fall down is one thing, but having a bike fall apart while going 20 mph is another. It's worth noting for the short people out there: You can pivot the RadWagon's handlebars to compensate for having shorter arms and a shorter torso. I'm 5'2"" and it can be difficult to find a bike—let alone a cargo bike—that will fit my frame. Get Your Motor Running If an e-bike seems mysteriously affordable to you, I would check to see which e-assist system they’re using. The Shimano Steps and Bosch eBike systems are by far the most prevalent, and will raise the price of any e-bike by almost a grand. They’re weatherproof, intelligent, integrated e-assist systems with incredibly long-lived batteries, that will only output precisely the amount of power you need to go as fast as you want. However, Rad Power is able to offer the RadWagon at a drastically lower price because instead of a Shimano or Bosch, it has a Shengyi e-assist system. The first tradeoff is the battery life. While you can travel around 100 miles with a Shimano battery, the estimated range on the RadWagon is 25-45 miles. I got to around 20 miles on one charge before I started to feel nervous about getting stranded. If you have a commute of longer than 10 miles, I would keep a charger at work. The RadWagon also tops out at a much lower speed, around 20 mph as compared to the R&amp;M Load’s 28 mph. The biggest difference is hard to describe. A Shimano or Bosch system is easy to calibrate. You can tinker with the gearing and different assist modes to tackle different terrain, or travel at different speeds. The intelligent motor will only provide just as much assistance as you need for every second that you're pedaling. The end result is that biking on a Shimano or Bosch system feels natural and intuitive. You can control the level of resistance that you feel on the pedals. You’re just more powerful, and with more stamina. The RadWagon also has five different assist modes. But rather than gauging the terrain or speed, the motor offers a certain amount of wattage per mode. For example, I found that in eco mode, the motor provided around 150 watts of power when I pedaled, versus 300 watts in standard mode. What I found was that in practice, the physical act of pedaling had little to do with how much propulsion the bike offered. One afternoon, I covered four miles without ever making a full rotation on the pedals. A half-rotation was enough to trigger the e-assist, and then I went back to coasting and daydreaming. My spouse actually liked this feature. He said that it made the motor seem more powerful. And the bike's e-assist was certainly effective. The bike's power and speed modes provided enough wattage for me to haul a cargo bike and groceries up a 30-degree hill. However, I like feeling resistance on the pedals. And going below 15 mph was hard. Even the lowest level of e-assist feels like an abrupt jerk when you trigger it at lower speeds. I enjoy my leisurely morning commute to my toddler's preschool, where she sits in her bike seat, talks, and sings. But I can't hear her if I'm going above ten miles an hour. She soon started objecting to our speedy, windy morning commutes, and I ended up turning off e-assist altogether. That wasn't as big a sacrifice as you might expect. After all, the bike also has a 21-speed Shimano drivetrain. But if I'm not using e-assist, we might as well get back on my old commuter bike. Ratchet Racket With all that said, the RadWagon is also the only e-cargo bike that I tested that falls within my personal budget. I might fantasize on a daily basis about selling my car, but I’d like to have one on hand in case either of my kids needed to visit the emergency room. With a max 45-mile range, I won’t be doing any epic bike tours on the RadWagon. And having ridden, and loved, both Shimano and Bosch systems, it was hard for me to overlook the Shengyi system's shortcomings. But a slightly jerky ride is more than compensated for by having an extra grand in your bank account. And for tooling around town, running errands, and hauling kids to and fro, the RadWagon works perfectly well. The RadWagon will be back in stock on Rad Power's website on August 13. Just make sure you can assemble it in a room where you can close the door.","Rad Power's RadWagon makes hauling groceries and kids a breeze, at a price you can actually pay.",2018-08-12T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","RadWagon Review: Finally, an Affordable E-Cargo Bike",https://www.wired.com/review/review-rad-power-radwagon/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b6dc81551297c21002b4523/191:100/pass/wagon.jpg,wired,Wired,mph,1
"Brett Clarkson, Doug Phillips","The regenerated Tropical Storm Kirk is one of those sequels nobody really wanted or asked for (see: Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 or Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo). The second installment of Kirk, resurrected Wednesday from the first Kirks remnants, was continuing to trek west toward the Caribbean at a decent clip, although not quite as fast as earlier in the week. Kirks top wind speeds had gone up by about 15 mph on Wednesday, from 45 mph in the morning to 60 mph in the afternoon, bringing Kirk closer to hurricane status, according to the National Hurricane Center. The minimum threshold for hurricanes is winds measuring 74 mph. A tropical storm warning, meaning that tropical storm conditions were likely over the next 36 hours, was in effect for islands along the eastern wall of the Caribbean including Barbados, St. Lucia, Dominica, Martinique and Guadaloupe. Kirk is about 1,800 miles southeast of South Florida and poses no immediate threat to our area. The storm is expected to be over the Lesser Antilles on Thursday afternoon. The Lesser Antilles are the arc-shaped line of islands that comprise form the eastern boundary of the Caribbean, separating the Caribbean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean. Watchers of the Atlantic tropics might recall that the short-lived first version of Tropical Storm Kirk weakened to a depression on Sunday before fizzling into a blob of clouds and storms by Monday. But regardless of whether or not Kirk intensifies further this time or remains a tropical storm, forecasters say the conditions up ahead in its path will not be amenable to the its long-term survival. Why? Wind shear. Shear, which refers to varying wind speeds in the atmosphere, is bad for tropical systems because it can weaken or kill them. Strong westerly shear is likely to continue to adversely affect Kirk while it moves over the Caribbean, and the system should weaken into a depression within 72 hours or sooner, and become a remnant low later in the forecast period, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. As of 2 p.m. Wednesday, Tropical Storm Kirk was spinning to the west at 18 mph about 300 miles east of Barbados. Meanwhile, an area of low pressure about 100 miles off North Carolina no longer has a chance of becoming a tropical depression, forecasters said. Finally, Post-Tropical Cyclone Leslie, in the central Atlantic a few hundred miles southwest of Portugals Azores Islands, has a 90 percent chance of becoming organized again over the next five days. brettclarkson@sun-sentinel.com or Twitter @BrettClarkson_","Sun Sentinel Tropical Storm Kirk, with winds up to 60 mph, is the sequel nobody wanted Sun Sentinel The regenerated Tropical Storm Kirk is one of those sequels nobody really wanted or asked for (see: “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2” or “Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo…",2018-09-26T19:04:49Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sun-sentinel.com'}","Tropical Storm Kirk, with winds up to 60 mph, is the sequel nobody wanted - Sun Sentinel",http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/fl-ne-kirk-comeback-atlantic-tropics-20180925-story.html,http://www.trbimg.com/img-5bac403c/turbine/fl-ne-kirk-comeback-atlantic-tropics-20180925,,Sun-sentinel.com,mph,1

Andrew Tarantola,"The convertible (code-named G14 by its design team) joins the coupe (G15) and a four-door Grand Touring edition (G16), the latter two of which were announced in June. Gone is the giant honkin' V-12 from the last time BMW made the 8-series, replaced with a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8. Even without the extra four cylinders, the 850i XDrives will still output 523 hp with 553 lb/ft of torque. That translates into a 3.6 second 0-60 that tops out at a speed-limited 155 mph. As the XDrive name indicates, the new 850i will offer AWD through an eight-speed automatic transmission, though the rear wheels will only powered if the vehicle's computer notices slippage. What's more, the rear wheels can be used to assist in steering -- helpful when taking extremely tight turns -- and the transmission is GPS-enabled, allowing it to effectively predict when it will need to change gears. The interior is similarly well appointed in terms of technology. The 850i will come with a digital instrument cluster, 12.3-inch infotainment hub, Bluetooth and Apple CarPlay compatibility (but oddly, not Android Auto), HUD and LED laser headlights. Its instrument buttons provide haptic feedback, so you won't have to take your eyes off the road to change the radio station on the optional 1375-watt Bowers &amp; Wilkins stereo. And like Lincoln's kneeling Aviator SUV, these new BMWs are NFC equipped, enabling drivers to use their similarly enabled phones to unlock the doors and start the car, all without a physical key or fob.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige. Spinning in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the hurricane has grown into a monstrous Category 5 storm, the most powerful type of hurricane with winds now reaching 160 mph. Tuesday evening, the National Hurricane Center called the cyclone ""an impressive hurricane,"" and forecast that the storm will ""move dangerously close to the main Hawaiian Islands as a hurricane Thursday through Saturday."" SEE ALSO: Why Trump's EPA wants to kill the nation's most ambitious climate change plan Hawaii's residents should ""prepare for a significant impact"" from Hurricane Lane, Ige said. National hurricane scientists emphasize that even if the center of the storm — where winds are strongest — doesn't pass directly over the islands, the state could still face serious problems from the storm. A storm this sprawling and powerful can bring threatening downpours and winds ""well away from the center of the hurricane, and impacts could be felt on any of the islands,"" the National Hurricane Center said. It's rare for powerful storms to veer near these well-populated tropical islands, in large part because hurricanes feed on warmer waters, and the oceans around Hawaii are often relatively cool for tropical seas. Yet, the National Hurricane Center notes that ocean waters along the storm's predicted track are currently ""warm enough to support a major hurricane."" Hurricane Lane is only the sixth Category 5 hurricane ever recorded in the central Pacific, Federal Emergency Management Agency atmospheric scientist Michael Lowry tweeted. But, Lane is the closest Category 5 storm to Hawaii that scientists have ever observed, he added. Although any year can bring warmer waters to a marine region, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and university scientists published research last year arguing that the tropical Pacific will likely see more ""extremely active"" hurricane seasons as human-caused global warming boosts ocean temperatures. As the planet continues an accelerated rate of warming due to human-caused climate change, around 95 percent of accumulated heat gets absorbed by the oceans, increasing the background levels of ocean warming and making warmer-than-normal temperatures more likely. ""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, recently said in an interview. A classic hurricane killer is wind shear — winds that hit hurricanes on their sides and can tilt them or blow off their top. But as of Tuesday night, government forecasters didn't expect increasing wind shear around Hawaii until Thursday evening, after some major effects are likely already felt in the state. As the storm skims the islands, or perhaps even makes landfall, severe and potentially historic flooding is expected. According to the National Hurricane Center, there will certainly be battering waves on the coast and potentially ""life-threatening flash flooding from heavy rainfall"" as water pours down the famously mountainous Hawaiian terrain.","Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige.

Andrew Liszewski,"Despite their growing popularity in cities like San Francisco as another alternative to cars, electric scooters have always seemed like nothing more than a pricier version of a toy I enjoyed as a kid. But the Unagi, an e-scooter that looks like it was actually designed for grown-ups, gave me a new appreciation for how practical they can potentially be. Unagi Electric Scooter WHAT IS IT? An electric scooter that doesn't look or run like a kid's toy. LIKE With an impressive range, and a top speed of 15.5 MPH, it's fun to ride. DISLIKE Braking can be finicky and abrupt, and you'll feel every bump on the road. Is an e-scooter for everyone? No, but the Unagi could potentially reduce the number of times youll need to hop in the car to complete a quick errand. A recent move to suburbia has meant that walking to a nearby restaurant for a quick lunch is no longer an option for me, and taking the car just to grab a quick burrito makes me feel too guilty. The Unagi is a happy medium between the two. I still prefer to walk when I can, but the e-scooter has greatly expanded the range of where I can go when time is limited, without having to reach for my car keys. Available in two versions, the E250 and E450, I tested the pricier and more powerful Unagi E450 which features a 200-watt electric motor built into the front wheel, and a 250-watt motor in the rear wheel, allowing it to tackle hills without a significant drop in speed. Both models can hit a top speed of 15.5 MPH (which feels a lot faster than it sounds) and have a range of about 15.5 miles thanks to a series of 25 (24 in the E250) 3,200 mAh lithium batteries hidden in the base of the scooter. The pricing reflects that power and speed, however, and the cheapest version of the Unagi goes for $890, while the model we tested is $1,090. You can get a well-equipped road bike for that much scratch, and if thats the experience youre after, it might be the better route. But if youre looking for the ease of a carminus the gas and insurance coststhe Unagi makes a strong case for its sticker shock. The design of the Unagi is definitely one of its more appealing features. Made from a combination of machined aluminum, carbon fiber, and a lightweight magnesium alloy for the handlebar assembly, the scooter looks like a team of designers spend some time to make it look like more than a toy, which should help adults feel a little less self-conscious about scooting around town. (Raises hand.) Weighing in at a little over 24 pounds, the Unagi is by no means lightweight, but it isnt impossibly heavy to move around, either. To make it easier to store, or bring it up the elevator to your office after your morning commute, the scooter features a handlebar that folds down using a unique hinge mechanism that securely holds it in either position. The hinge mechanism used for the Unagis folding handlebars is incredibly sturdy, but the release lever can be a bit tricky to slide. Photo: Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo) It works well; the handlebars dont feel loose when upright, and when folded down they can be used as a carrying handle. However, the sliding lever thats used to release the locking hinge mechanism can be a little difficult to move when the handlebars are in their upright position. You need to wiggle the handlebars a bit to get it to slide and unlock, and I still havent quite gotten the hang of it. One of the most unique features of the Unagi are its airless tires that surround each wheels electric motor hub with a series of rubber spokes. Companies like Bridgestone have been touting the advantages of these tires for years: they never deflate or go flat, and they provide additional shock absorption. As you get closer to the e-scooters top speed, youre going to feel every little bump on the road. Its airless tires are no match for a cars suspension system. GIF: Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo) The former might be true for the Unagi; youre never going to be stranded by a flat tire. But with wheels measuring just 7.5-inches in diameter, you still end up feeling every bump and crack in the road. At slower speeds the airless tires do a better job at absorbing uneven terrain, but as you get closer to 15 MPH I found myself constantly scanning the road ahead for the smoothest patches of asphalt I could find. Controlling the Unagi scooter is all done through a collection of buttons and levers surrounding a high-contrast display that provides details on your current speed, distance traveled, remaining battery life, and which riding mode youre in. Mode 1 limits the scooters top speed to 9.3 MPH, while mode 3 lets you get it up to 15.5 MPH, and they can be toggled on the fly by double-tapping one of the buttons. The graphical battery meter is the only feedback you have for how much longer the Unagi scooter will run, but I found it a little vague. It also tended to show more of an estimation of how much battery life was left given the current terrain you were on. So when riding up a steep hill it would drop to a single red bar, but once you hit the top and were back on level ground, it would immediately climb back up to three full bars again. An estimation of miles or minutes you had, based on the battery level, would be a nice addition here. Braking and accelerating are handled by a pair of large thumb levers which offer a good deal of precision, once you get used to how much force you need to use. As an added safety feature, the accelerator lever (on the right) wont function until the scooter is already moving, requiring you to manually kick off first. Its a feature that has probably saved me from a fall more than once while Ive been standing with one foot on the scooter, getting ready to ride. In comparison, I think the sensitivity of the braking lever (on the left) could use a bit of a tweak. It works, but even the slightest press will activate the scooters braking system with enough force to make you feel a little anxious about going over the handlebarsalthough that has yet to actually happen to me. The brakes work quite well, and can bring the scooter to a full stop from top speed in about 12 to 13-feet. But you really need to learn to have a gentle touch with it, which isnt always easy when youre bouncing around at 15+ MPH. As safety features go, the Unagi scooters got the basics covered with side reflectors, a series of bright red LEDs on the back that start flashing when the braked are applied, and a high-pitched electronic horn thats one of the most unpleasant sounds Ive ever heard. It will, without a doubt, get someones attention. And while theyll probably be mad at you for blaring it, at least theyll see you coming. Even on a poorly lit street, the Unagis headlight does a good job at illuminating your path. GIF: Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo) Ill admit that I wasnt expecting much from the Unagis headlight, but the cluster of LEDs it uses does a decent job at throwing enough light on the road ahead to see where youre going at night. Odds are youll be using the e-scooter in urban settings most of the time when street lights already provide a good amount of illumination, but even without them, the Unagis headlight still made it easy to spot obstacles. 1 / 3 If youre looking for something to ride up and down the street, and nothing more than a quick thrill, companies like Razor sell adult-friendly e-scooters for less than $300. But if youre looking for an alternative to a car, or public transit, or just dont want to work up a sweat biking to work every morning, the Unagi feels like an e-scooter that wants to be more than just a toy. Its certainly not cheap, but its much cheaper than paying for parking and gas to get around a crowded urban center. But even for someone like myself living in suburbia and working from home, in a little over a weeks time the Unagi has managed to work its way into my daily routine. Its made the boring walk to the community mailbox something I look forward to every evening, and its greatly expanded my range of lunch options. Now if only I could put snow tires on it. The Unagi Scooter is being launched today through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, and the single motor E250 model will be available for as little as $623 for the first backers, while the more powerful E450 option, which is what we tested, can be had for $763. Delivery is expected to start in January of next year for the first backers, with the final units shipping out in March. As with any crowdfunded product, theres always a level of risk involved, even when production-ready products can be demonstrated, as is the case here. If youd prefer to wait and see, the Unagi will eventually be available through the companys website, but without the discounts. [ Unagi Scooters ] README An electric scooter that looks like it was actually designed for adults. The top speed of 15.5 MPH feels a lot faster than it sounds. It takes about three or four hours to charge, but will run for about 15 mileswell over an hourdepending on how hilly the terrain is. The scooters battery icon doesnt give you the best idea of how long or how far youll be able to scoot. The braking control lever requires a light touch, and even then, stopping the scooter can feel abrupt, even at slower speeds. With a starting price of $890 its definitely not a toy, but it could very well replace a car depending on the length of your commute or your driving needs.","Despite their growing popularity in cities like San Francisco as another alternative to cars, electric scooters have always seemed like nothing more than a pricier version of a toy I enjoyed as a kid.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"How do you know where anything is in space? Sure, you can say, “Oh, that star, it’s the one in the middle of the Big Dipper,” but that’s not very useful in an era of incredible telescopes peeping at galaxies billions of light-years away. On January 1, 2019, scientists will adopt the newest, internationally standardized frame of reference to help locate things in space. The third edition of the International Celestial Reference Frame, or ICRF-3, is the most up-to-date version of the International Astronomy Union’s standardized reference frame. Imagine the universe as a graph from geometry—scientists need a place to put the origin and axes. “Nitty-gritty stuff like this is super important when you’re sitting on an Earth moving 70,000 mph around a star that is moving 450,000 mph around a galaxy center,” Grant Tremblay, astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told Gizmodo. Every physics problem starts with an innate step you might not realize: determining where the problem is taking place and the coordinates you’ll use to watch the physics happen. Astronomers need to do this, too, like drawing a graph in space. The ICRF-3 is the latest update to our reference frame, following ICRF-1 from 1998 and ICRF-2 from 2009. It places the center of the reference frame at the Solar System’s center of mass, and is oriented based on the position of distant bright radio sources called quasars. Those measurements were made using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), essentially a method of using the entire Earth as a telescope, collecting data from multiple radio telescopes and combining them to get the highest-resolution image possible. This most recent frame derives from measurements of 4,536 quasars, all between 100 million and 10 billion light-years away. At these distances, they’re basically stationary. The most recent edition also takes the motion of our own Milky Way galaxy into account for the first time, according to a press release from the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam. So, now we can determine where we are, more precisely than before, in the incomprehensibly vast cosmos. I hope this offers some comfort.","How do you know where anything is in space?

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It feels like 2018 is the year of rapid intensification. Storm after storm after storm has spun up from humble begins to cyclonic monster around the world. The latest cyclone to join the ignominious club is Typhoon Yutu which is in the midst of spinning up into a forecast Category 5 super typhoon by Wednesday. Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands lie squarely in the typhoons path. Yutu spent all of Tuesday ramping up and as of the latest Joint Typhoon Warning Center bulletin, it had estimated winds of 127 mph. Thats the equivalent of a very strong Category 3 storm, and with nothing but warm water in its path, Yutu is expected to continuing amping up. The storms winds could be roaring around 155 mph as it approaches Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands on Thursday morning local time. The National Weather Service Guam office has posted a typhoon warning calling for powerful surf and up to half a foot of rain. The hilly terrain of Guam will be but a speed bump for Yutu, which is forecast to keep climbing in intensity through the end of the week. Its winds could reach an astounding 172 mph, which would put it among the strongest storm on Earth this year. Thankfully, it will achieve that terrifying feat over open water with no threat to land. Some weather experts have been watching the storm via satellite and wondering if the official forecast is a bit underdone and if Yutu could be more intense than current estimates. Thats because theres a subjective element involved. Satellites dont measure storms wind speeds directly, but provide a snapshot of convection and the processes that indicate how healthy a storm is. Meteorologists use that data to estimate wind speeds using something called the Dvorak technique. Without getting into a bunch of equations, suffice to say forecasters use what the satellite imagery reveals about convection, temperatures within the storm, and a few other factors to come up with a T number, which can be translated into an estimated wind speed. The technique is super useful for remote parts of the Pacific that dont have the benefit of estimates from aircraft like the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administrations Hurricane Hunters. And Chris Velden, a hurricane expert at the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), told Earther that using the technique gets the mean state right most of the time, but it can break down when you have anomalous conditions like a very rapidly intensifying storm or decaying storm. Yutu is one of those storms, and while Velden said he felt the current official forecast was pretty spot-on, that doesnt mean the storm wont continue to push the limits of whats possible. This has potential to grow into a Category 5 real quickly, he said. People at the Joint Typhoon Warning Center are watching this.

Indemnis Parachute For DJI Drones straps onto DJI’s large drones and features a launcher that deploys a parachute when sensor detect flight anomalies.
To become certified, the Alaska-based company’s product had to pass a series of obstacles that included 45 functionality tests across 5 different failure scenarios. The tests were designed to ensure the parachute deploys at the right time, every time.
According to a press release, this product works like this:
“Nexus is a ballistic parachute launcher, triggered automatically if the drone suddenly begins tilting abnormally or falling. It deploys the parachute within 30 milliseconds at 90 mph, through a tube that rapidly inflates to keep the parachute lines away from the drone body and propellers. Indemnis offers the Nexus package today for the Inspire 2, and intends to offer it for Matrice 200 series and Matrice 600 series drones by late 2019.”

Roy Cooper said. ""This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall -- in some places measured in feet, not inches,"" Here are the startling numbers behind Florence's wrath -- so far: That's just the number of customers without power in the Carolinas. The number of people who lost electricity is far greater since a single customer can represent an entire home. About 809,000 of those customers are North Carolina, and about 155,000 are in South Carolina. South Carolina has reported its first death from Florence. A 61-year-old woman died Friday night when her car struck a tree that fell during the storm, state emergency officials said. In North Carolina, at least five deaths are related to the storm -- but ""several others are under investigation,"" Cooper said. ""Remember: Most storm deaths occur from drowning in fresh water, often in cars,"" he said. ""Don't drive across standing or moving water."" That's how hard the wind gusted in North Carolina's New River inlet. Both Wilmington International Airport and Fort Macon suffered gusts of 105 mph, the National Weather Service said.

Bryan Menegus,"This week, hitman and hobbyist runner Mark Iceman Fellows was convicted of the murders of English gangland figures Paul Massey and John Kinsella. Among the crucial pieces of evidence in his trial was a Garmin Forerunnera GPS-linked fitness watch that tied Fellows to pre-assassination reconnaissance on one his targets.
For those interested in the particulars of gang activity in the greater Manchester area, the Manchester Evening News has an excellent recap of the lurid events, which include an acid attack at a funeral, a bouquet of flowers from the infamous prisoner Charles Bronson, and Fellows surviving a bullet in the ass. Are these the hallmarks of crime in the UK? As an American non-gangster, I truly dont know if these are extraordinary circumstances or just What Happens Over There. 
Although police reportedly suspected Fellowss involvement in Masseys murder, during the three years between that hit and when Kinsella was gunned down while walking his dogs, it effectively became a cold case. A raid on Fellowss apartment after the second killing, however, turned up the Garmin.
According the Liverpool Echo, a photo taken at the Great Manchester Run showed Fellows wearing the watch less than two months before Masseys murder. And when authorities looked at the data on the Garmin, it put Fellows near Masseys home just days before thatin what prosecutors called a reconnaissance mission.
In court, a GPS expert explained that the watch not only tracked location data, but recorded speed as well, suggesting how specific parts of the route between Fellowss and Masseys neighborhoods were traveled. From Runners World:
Professor Last said the wearer set out initially traveling at around 12 mph, which suggested they were on a bike. When they reached the field, the speed dropped to about 3 mph, consistent with walking, before they stopped for about 8 minutes. According to the Liverpool Echo, this is the alleged escape route that Fellows ran or perhaps rode his bike on two months later, after gunning down Massey in his own driveway.
The running enthusiast site was not able to match the hitman with any public profile on the Garmin or Strava platforms, but its still poor OpSec to carry a surveillance device while plotting a felony.
Fellows, 38, is believed to have been paid £10,000 (around $12,800) for Masseys killing. On Thursday, he was sentenced to life in prison.","This week, hitman and hobbyist runner Mark “Iceman” Fellows was convicted of the murders of English gangland figures Paul Massey and John Kinsella.

Rayne Ellis,"On Wednesday, Hurricane Florence became the first major hurricane of the 2018 season in the Atlantic Ocean. On Thursday, astronauts saw the ominous storm swirling from space. NASA astronaut Ricky Arnold captured images of Florence as it strengthened on Thursday from his post on the International Space Station. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is our first major hurricane of the 2018 season in the Atlantic. Where will it go? ""#HurricaneFlorence strengthens in the early morning hours over the Atlantic,"" Arnold said on Twitter. In the photos, Florence seems massive, albeit somewhat disorganized since the hurricane's eye isn’t immediately noticeable and the storm has lost some of it's symmetry. The hurricane — now teetering between Category 2 and Category 3 status — gained some momentum in the Atlantic on Wednesday night, reaching wind speeds above 130 mph, making it a Category 4, if only for a few hours. As of right now, not much is known about what the hurricane is going to do next. Earlier today, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) released an update, suggesting that Florence has continued to weaken since it reached Category 4 status earlier this morning. NASA Image: nasa earth observatory According to this update, Hurricane Florence is now a Category 2, with wind speeds reaching 105 mph, which means it is no longer a major hurricane. This is likely due to wind shear, or strong opposing winds whipping over that portion of the Atlantic that can tear storms apart. However, meteorologists predict that this weakening is only momentary and believe that within the next 36 hours, Florence will regain intensity and again become a major hurricane.

Jennings Brown,"Ubers driverless cars are cruising around Pittsburg again, returning from their hiatus following a fatal crash in Tempe, Arizona.
That self-driving test car struck and killed a cyclist on March 13little more than nine months ago. A backup driver was behind the wheel, but police reports show they were streaming The Voice at the time of the collision. A week before the crash, an Uber employee, Robbie Miller, reportedly warned company executives in an email about safety concerns.
Ubers head of advanced technologies Eric Meyhofer announced in a blog post on Thursday that its driverless cars began driving on public roads again.
 The company received permission to test autonomous cars in Pittsburg from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation earlier this week. 
When reached for comment, a company spokesperson referred Gizmodo to Meyhofers blog, which highlights safeguards the company announced in July, safety reviews, and a safety report. This required a lot of introspection and took some time, Meyhofer writes. Now we are ready to move forward.
 Uber says starting today each test car will have two human operators prepared to take control in emergencies, and drivers will work in four-hour shifts. Previously, these operators worked eight- to 10-hour shifts. The company says it has also added cameras that make an audible alert when they detect distracted drivers, and reports them to a monitor team. These cars arent permitted to take passengers. 
Back in March, Ubers self-driving cars were reportedly driving up to 55 mph. Now, they are only supposed to go up to 25 mph, according to a report from the New York Times. The Times reports that the cars will drive on a circuit in the busy Pittsburghs Strip District, but only during weekdays when the sun is up. 
In the aforementioned warning email that an Uber manager sent to executives, he mentioned reports of the dangerous behavior of backup drivers. Millers email mentioned routine accidents:
This is usually the result of poor behavior of the operator or the AV technology. A car was damaged nearly every other day in February. We shouldnt be hitting things every 15,000 miles. Repeated infractions for poor driving rarely results in termination. Several of the drivers appear to not have been properly vetted or trained.
Ubers autonomous cars also started driving in Toronto and San Francisco on Thursday, but Uber says the cars will only be operated in manual mode by human driversfor the purpose of teaching the system scenarios it will face when the cars are free of their human masters.

Gina Martinez,"Hurricane Florence has downgraded to a tropical storm but is expected to regain hurricane status as its path hurls towards the U.S. East Coast in the next week. Florence’s wind speed have decreased and as of Friday the tropical storm has had a maximum sustained winds of 65 mph, down from 140 mph, but is expected to strengthen in the next coming days. Florence is currently 1,600 miles from the East Coast and moving toward Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center said. As Florence’s path moves closer to the U.S. coastline in the next week Florence is expected to regain category three hurricane status. It is not yet known if Florence will make landfall. The first Category 4 hurricane of 2018 of the Atlantic season, Florence formed near the Cabo Verde Islands last weekend. AccuWeather Hurricane Expert Dan Kottlowski expects high pressures to strengthen Florence. “An area of high pressure over the central Atlantic will bridge westward and join with an existing high pressure near the U.S. East Coast over the next several days,” Kottlowski said. “This setup will guide Florence on a west to northwesterly course into next week.” The National Hurricane Center said despite Florence eventual path, large swells will begin to affect Bermuda on Friday and the U.S. East Coast this weekend, resulting in life-threatening surfs and rip currents. NHC added that the risk of direct impact from the storm along the U.S. East Coast over the next week has increased but there it is is too soon to determine location, magnitude and timing of the impact. The National Hurricane Center has not yet issued any coastal watches or warnings as of their 5 p.m. ET advisory.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","In this photo provided by Daniella Fenelon, first responders work at the scene of an Amtrak train that derailed south of Seattle on Dec. 18, 2017. (Photo: Daniella Fenelon, AP) The fatal Amtrak crash south of Seattle occurred on track where equipment for automatic braking, which Congress has required on all railroads by the end of 2018, was installed but was still being tested. Train 501 was going 80 mph Monday in a curve posted for 30 mph when several cars derailed and dangled off a bridge above Interstate 5, according to Bella Dinh-Zarr, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board that is investigating. At least three people died in the accident and others were critically injured. The board will spend months determining what role speed and any other factors played in the accident before making recommendations about how to avoid future accidents. Congress set the deadline for railroads to install automatic braking after a collision in Chatsworth, Calif., in 2008 between a commuter train and a freight train killed 25 people. Safety advocates contend the technology could have prevented the accident. The technology collectively known as “Positive Train Control” provides signals between tracks and trains to slow down when speeding or stop at the appropriate signals if the engineer isn’t responding. Railroads are installing the technology piecemeal across the country at a cost of billions of dollars. ""The Positive Train Control equipment has been installed and is now still in testing, which is why the system has not been activated,"" said Jason Abrams, an Amtrak spokesman, said of the track owned by a Seattle-area transit company where the accident occurred. However, several Amtrak fatal crashes have occurred in recent years, even where automatic braking has been installed. More: Amtrak: Modern braking system coming to N.E. Corridor by year's end NTSB: Amtrak's systemic safety lapses, lack of equipment caused fatal train crash in Pa. On Monday, the Amtrak train was traveling without automatic braking along track owned by Sound Transit that was dispatched by BNSF Railway, according to Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson. “As far as Positive Train Control goes, we are huge supporters of Positive Train Control at Amtrak,” Anderson said. Sound Transit didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Keith Millhouse, rail-safety consultant and a former board chairman of Metrolink at the time of the Chatsworth collision, has advocated for Positive Train Control because rail accidents often result from human errors such as distraction that could be avoided with automatic braking. “The big tragedy here is that if indeed it was over-speed, positive train control would have prevented this accident,” Millhouse said. He said the accident was “eerily similar” to the fatal Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia in May 2015, which killed eight people and injured hundreds. The NTSB ruled that the engineer lost awareness of where he was on his route and headed into a 50-mph curve at more than 100 mph. Positive Train Control hadn’t been installed on that part of track by the time of the accident, but Amtrak completed it along its portion of the Northeast Corridor in December 2015. Benedict Morelli, a New York lawyer who represented passengers in the crash, said Congress should have hastened the requirement for railroads to adopt the technology before the latest accident. “I worry when I get on an airplane. Before I represented these people, I didn’t get on an Amtrak train and think, ‘God, I hope I don’t derail,’” Morelli said. “Now it’s happening and happening and happening. It just doesn’t make any sense.” Even when completed, the system is not foolproof. An Amtrak train struck a backhoe at 99 mph outside Philadelphia in April 2016, killing two people and injuring 36 — despite automatic braking being installed along the track. In a safety lapse between work shifts, the board found a night foreman lifted a closure on the track, which the day foreman didn’t resume, even though the backhoe remained on the track. Anderson refused to speculate about what caused Monday’s crash. But he said Amtrak listens to NTSB guidance and is making investments based on recommendations from previous accidents. “We take those very seriously and continue to make the investments recommended by the NTSB,” Anderson said. “Safety is the highest priority of the Amtrak board.” Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2AYDcrR",Train 501 was going 80 mph Monday in a curve posted for 30 mph when several cars derailed and dangled off a bridge above Interstate 5.,2017-12-19T17:02:55Z,"{'id': 'usa-today', 'name': 'USA Today'}",Amtrak train derailed on track that had automatic-braking technology — but it wasn't switched on,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/19/speeding-amtrak-train-derailed-track-without-automatic-braking/964483001/,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/becdab093f3b753cfa3857a0cf7a2c8a4a6e71b4/c=0-105-1023-683&r=x803&c=1600x800/local/-/media/2017/12/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636492767263577831-AMTRAK-DERAIL.JPG,usa-today,USA Today,mph,1

Andrew Tarantola,"""A 10-ton truck traveling at 600 mph"" : The US Navy showed off one of its newest toys this week, a nuke-hunting ballistic ""kill vehicle"" that knocks incoming missiles out of the sky through sheer force of physics. This is only the second time that the tests have been successful (two other attempts failed to connect) but that's still not bad for a prototype system described as being akin to ""a bullet shooting a bullet"". 11 years : After more than a decade of service, NASA's Dawn spacecraft will not see another sunrise, having run completely out of fuel this week. Oddly, it wasn't the only space telescope to go dark, the Kepler mission came to a similar conclusion after expending the last of its hydrazine fuel source. 6 percent : Turns out that despite there being seven billion of us, the worldwide market for smartphones is indeed finite. Global handset sales dropped by 6 percent over the last 3 months, which could explain why Apple is suddenly so reluctant to share its own sales numbers. $81 million per seat : It's no small feat getting crew and cargo up to the International Space Station, so when things go wrong with the Soyuz launch system, as they did earlier this month, technicians literally pore over the craft to see what went wrong. In this case it was a bent sensor pin that caused the launch failure. Luckily, nobody was hurt during the abort and Russia already has a backup launch scheduled for the start of December. $60,000 : That seems like an awful lot of money to offer a person to recommend your gimmick product to their million-plus Instagram followers, then sue them for when they don't do it, but hey we're clearly living in the end times where being an ""influencer"" is a real job, so sure, why not.","Gavin McInnes and his gang of Proud Boys, newly minted stars of the Alt-Right, took their first steps back toward irrelevancy this week when they got themselves banned from Facebook.

Susan Karlin,"After seven years of development, seven months in space, and “seven minutes of terror” plunging through the Martian atmosphere at up to 13,000 mph and 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, InSigh t touched the surface at a gentle 5 mph at 2:52:59 p.m. ET. NASA’s InSight Mars lander acquired this image of the area in front of the lander using its lander-mounted Instrument Context Camera (ICC). [Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech] “Whoo- hoo !” Hollering and applause erupted from the throngs of NASA staff, VIPs, reporters, and social media ambassadors packing the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Mission Control and press rooms. At viewing parties across the country, including in Times Square, and across hundreds of thousands of office screens and mobile devices, untold numbers looked on agog. Within minutes, her first image appeared: a dirt-spattered fish-eye view of Mars. “To be in the room when the data stops, to know how quiet it gets, and then once it comes back—the elation!” gushed NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine in the post-landing briefing. International Space Station astronaut Alexander Gerst weighed in : “I got goosebumps watching the coverage!” “Nice and dirty!” laughed InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt about the photo after garnering effusive applause. Since the mid-’80s—including some half dozen failed proposals—Banerdt has been trying to get the first seismometer on Mars since the 1976 Viking lander. “This is a longtime dream come true for me.” Watch a recap of the landing: Watch (and click around) a 360-degree video of the landing: The eighth successful Mars landing, InSight will remain on the flat Elysium Planitia expanse gathering data during the next two years that will reveal Mars’s internal structure and clues to the beginnings of all rocky planets, including Earth. The earliest data should arrive in spring. “Those answers are in the details of the structure formed very early in the planet’s history,” Banerdt told reporters at a pre-landing session last week. “On Mars, that structure has been preserved for the last 4.5 billion years; on Earth, it’s been scrambled up by plate tectonics and mantle convection, wiping away evidence of those earliest processes. So we’re going to Mars to study those early processes to help us understand how Earth got to where we are today.” The first mission to study the deep interior of Mars, InSight—or, Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport—will monitor the planet’s seismic activity, rotational wobble, and underground temperatures to determine the size, thickness, and density of its mantle, core, and crust, as well as current geothermal activity and number of meteorites. The lander will also have the first continuous weather monitoring on Mars, offering daily readings of temperature (now a balmy 93ºF ), wind, and barometric pressure.

[Credit: NASA/JPL] It was also a success for Mars Cube One (MarCO), a separate but coordinated mission testing the two first deep-space satellites, which relayed images of InSight’s descent in near real-time, and transmitted the lander’s first shot. MarCO will spend the next two weeks transmitting data on the Martian atmosphere. InSight has two cameras: one, a fish-eye lens offering 120- to 130-degree views that took the first shot; the other, a normal lens mounted on the seven-foot robotic arm. The latter will take 56 images that, when composited, will give scientists a 3D image of where the lander, seismometer, and heat flow sensor are, in space, from each other. The 3D imagery will assist in creating a digital elevation map and help with instrument placement—a task, that JPL science system engineer Elizabeth Barrett likens to “playing a claw game at a carnival, with blindfolds, on another planet.” An initial InSight selfie taken with its larger lens late Monday at JPL, after deployment of the solar panels.

(Note Earth and Mars lighting comparisons below.) The simulation stage boasts a true-to-size (3.5-foot-high x 20-foot-wide) model lander on fine gravel to test instrument placement on unstable surfaces, as well as instrument and camera function in that environment. Earth lighting (L); Mars lighting (R). [Photos: Susan Karlin] From here, it’s another three months to survey the area, place, and calibrate the instruments. “It’s a slow-motion mission compared to others,” said Banerdt. “It’ll be six months before we can get a glimmer of what we’re looking for. The more marsquakes, the better we can see the inside.” NASA will make raw images and seismic data available to the public and NASA’s Seismology in Schools program. “This science is for everyone,” said Banerdt. “It’s the start now of answering a whole set of questions,” NASA’s chief scientist Jim Green tells Fast Company. “The more we understand about Mars, the more we’ll understand about how terrestrial planets evolve. It might help us interpret exoplanets and whether they’re habitable. If humans are going to live and work on Mars, they’re not going to want to build habitats that marsquakes are going to knock down. We don’t do Star Trek; we don’t go where no human has gone before. We need to know as much as we can before we send humans.” See my feature on InSight for a more in-depth explanation of this science.","Backstage at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, you could hear a pin drop as the InSight lander descended to Mars without a hitch.

Mark Kaufman,"There's no doubt that hurricanes are complicated beasts with complex origins. But following the Atlantic's extremely active 2017 hurricane season, a group of scientists at Princeton University's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory have identified a connection between the six major hurricanes with winds over 110 mph that churned in the ocean, three of which pummeled the U.S. All were supercharged by unusually warm waters, and these warm conditions outweighed other weather factors. This research published on Thursday in the journal Science has significant climate change implications, as the world is expected to continue its accelerating warming trend. Hurricane Irma on Sept. 8, 2017. Image: nasa Critically, over 90 percent of the accumulating heat on Earth is absorbed by the planet's oceans. ""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" NASA oceanographer Josh Willis said. Hurricanes feed off warm waters. It's their fuel. But still, warm waters alone don't stoke hurricanes. SEE ALSO: How flocks of birds got trapped inside the eye of Hurricane Florence To pinpoint the factors that drove the 2017 hurricane season, the Princeton scientists used a sophisticated climate computing model to simulate the different wide-scale weather conditions on Earth. This is no easy task. Any hurricane season has a number of influences that may propel, or dampen, the storm season or any particular storm. ""It's quite complicated, theres many moving parts,"" Colin Zarzycki, a storm scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research who had no role in the study, said in an interview. ""It's not just ocean temperature. It's kind of a big tangled web."" Hurricane Harvey as seen from the International Space Station in August 2017. Image: nasa But even so, after simulating different weather conditions, it became clear that other major climate factors like cooling in the Pacific waters were overpowered by the effects of the unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic. The increase in 2017 hurricanes was caused ""mainly by pronounced warm sea surface conditions in the tropical North Atlantic,"" the researchers wrote. But there was another critical factor driving these storms. ""The key point is that the Atlantic was warmer than other open oceans all over the world,"" the study's lead author, Hiroyuki Murakami, said in an interview. This caused more warm air to rise up into the sky over the Atlantic, making the atmosphere more unstable and ripe for tumultuous storm activity. In short, the Atlantic ocean got an ""extra kick"" from all this rising motion, Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane scientist at Florida International University, said over email. ""As a result, thunderstorms that feed hurricanes become stronger,"" said Willoughby. Hurricanes Maria and Jose in September 2017. Image: nasa The power of warm waters The Atlantic wasn't just warm it was much warmer than Earth's other oceans. But regardless, just having unusually warm waters in the Atlantic is still going to fuel powerful storms. ""When you get an ocean basin that gets warm like that, it really primes the atmosphere to be conducive to these strong storms,"" said Zarzycki. ""When you boil it down, with warmer atmosphere and sea surface temperatures, under ideal conditions we would expect storms to be stronger."" That said, Zarzycki underscores that other weather factors like strong wind shear that pummels and weakens hurricanes can weaken or tear apart any storm. But without these weakening factors, hurricanes can really ignite as they did in 2017. Going forward, what might this all mean for the future storm activity? Should we expect more major hurricanes? In future decades, perhaps by 2080, warming oceans may boost the count of major storms in the Atlantic during a busy season from six to eight, said Murakami. This means more opportunities for giant storms to hit the U.S. coast. But in the next 10 years, he can't say if warmer oceans might generate more major hurricanes. Weather patterns, or natural variability, are just too unpredictable. Hurricane Maria passing over Puerto Rico. Image: nasa ""It remains uncertain as to whether we will see more frequent active hurricane seasons like 2017 in the upcoming decade due to the dominant influence of natural variability,"" Murakami said. For example, there's a major climate trend running on 30-year timescales called the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation, that can warm or cool vast swaths of the Atlantic, said Willoughby. Saharan dust from Africa also blows over the ocean, which can cool the waters, he said. And there are major influences from the Pacific Ocean that can drive down wind shear in the Atlantic. ""All of these well-established oceanic vacillations make it harder to define the long-term warming caused by us humans,"" said Willoughby. So, it's complicated. But one thing is much more certain: Warm oceans fueled the Atlantic's extremely active 2017 season. And overall, we can expect more warm water.","There's no doubt that hurricanes are complicated beasts with complex origins.

Megan Rose Dickey,"About a year ago, David Hyman, former Beats Music CEO and co-founder of music startup Mog that eventually sold to Beats Music, did something that was “very abnormal for me — career-wise,” he told TechCrunch. Hyman was an entrepreneur in residence at a giant real estate company. Because the music industry has changed so much, he said he didn’t want to do another music company. While at this real estate company, Hyman said he started riding electric scooters everywhere, realizing that “it was so much better to get on a rideshare scooter than to drive my car or take an Uber.” One day, Hyman rode one of these shared electric scooters to a grocery store in Oakland to buy some ice cream. Once he got back outside, the scooter was gone. He proceeded to look for the closest scooter, which was about one-quarter mile away, he said. But as he was approaching the scooter, someone scooped it up. That’s when Hyman said he had his epiphany. “I just want one when I open my door and I want to take it on BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) and jump off and go wherever I want,” Hyman said. “And so that embarked on a journey to find one to buy, but I couldn’t find a good one to buy in the U.S.” Hyman was looking for one that was portable and lightweight, with good range, torque and motor power. He landed on one he found on Alibaba, but still wasn’t completely jazzed about it. That’s where Unagi, founded by Hyman, comes in. Launching on Kickstarter today, Unagi is looking to raise $30,000 and start shipping the scooters in January. Unlike the other electric scooter startups that have cropped up over the past year, Unagi is taking a different approach. Hyman is betting that after people become accustomed to riding electric scooters via the likes of Bird, Lime, Spin, Skip and so forth, they’ll realize it’s cheaper to just buy their own. Though, Hyman admits he does not have any data to back up that hypothesis. “A lot of people are going to go through the decision cycle I went through, which is that they prefer ownership,” he said. “I don’t know if that’s one percent of the market or five percent of the market or 10 percent. I actually have nine UC Berkeley MBA students right now helping me figure out the market size.” The Unagi scooter itself is undoubtedly beautiful. That’s in part thanks to a design partnership the company formed with a firm out of China. The scooters are manufactured across 15 different Chinese plants, but Hyman said the company might start assembling the scooters in the U.S. “There’s this tax people talk about called the Trump tax,” he said. Right now, Unagi’s minimum production goal is 300 scooters upon launch, but Hyman thinks it’ll probably be somewhere between 500 to 1,000. Unagi comes in a couple of different models — a 250 watt for $890 and a $450 watt for $1,190. Both of the models have three riding modes: beginner (9.3 mph max speed), intermediate (12.4 mph max speed) and advanced (15.5 mph max speed). Compared to other electric scooters you could own, Unagi is a bit more expensive than its competitors. The Xiaomi Mi retails for $599 on Amazon while the Ninebot scooter costs $777. But Hyman said he’s not necessarily looking to get the price down, noting how you “pay a premium for beautiful design. That’s just the reality of it.” Hyman also pointed out that Unagi is built with carbon fiber instead of aluminum, as well as magnesium alloy handles. I rode the scooter once and didn’t feel entirely confident about the brakes, which are all electric (versus electric plus mechanical, or electric plus disc brake), on the downhill. Hyman took a look at the scooter I’d been riding and didn’t see any apparent problems with it. Minus the braking issue, the Unagi is fun to ride and will even get you up some hills in San Francisco. For future models, Hyman said he’s thinking about security and locking mechanisms. He envisions including GPS tracking to make it easier to recover your scooter if it gets lost or stolen. Unagi is entirely bootstrapped but is today launching a $30,000 Kickstarter campaign.","About a year ago, David Hyman, former Beats Music CEO and co-founder of music startup Mog that eventually sold to Beats Music, did something that was “very abnormal for me — career-wise,” he told TechCrunch.

Darrell Etherington,"SF Motors has revealed its first two models, electric vehicles aiming for 2018 production and 2019 street dates. The electric vehicle technology company with a headquarters in Silicon Valley, as well as a globe-spanning R&amp;D footprint and manufacturing facilities in both China and the U.S., and it’s aiming to distinguish itself rom the established market with unique powertrains, autonomous features and shared technology development. Their first two cars are the SF5 and SF7, a smaller and a mid-sized all-electric SUV. The SF5 is aiming to have a pre-order date of 2018, and will also aim to ship in 2019 to customers if all goes to plan. They’ll feature “proprietary” powertrain technology that will achieve 1000 horsepower and a 0-to-60 mph acceleration time of under 3 seconds. Range is rated at over 300 miles by EPA standards, SF Motors says, thanks to a “patented” battery system that emphasizes safety through design. The automaker is also working on a future battery system that would incorporate battery units directly into the vehicle’s chassis, for a more streamlined design. [gallery ids=""1613830,1613831,1613832,1613833,1613834,1613835,1613836,1613837,1613838,1613839,1613840""] A lot of SF Motors’ secret sauce comes down to in-house development of key systems, the automaker says, including its own in-house electronic controller design. It’s also testing “protective autonomy,” systems that use deep learning and LiDAR sensor perception to create a “safer ride,” with road tests in California, Michigan and China currently in progress as of earlier this month. The full extent of this system and how it works hasn’t been detailed, but it will automated driving tasks with “minimal human input” required, per SF Motors. The company is debuting its first target production vehicles today, but it’s also hoping to potentially provide its proprietary powertrain and battery tech design to other automakers via license, which could help it get over the early hurdles of production ramp that most young EV companies hoping to take on Tesla and other legacy automakers face.","SF Motors has revealed its first two models, electric vehicles aiming for 2018 production and 2019 street dates.

Steve Dent,"Pulsars are superdense neutron stars that form out of massive supernovae. They can only be found when their electromagnetic beams points directly to Earth like a nuclear-powered lighthouse. Pulsars have been found to rotate as fast as 1.6 milliseconds, or 38,500 rpm. They pick up the angular momentum of the massive stars that formed them, but are a fraction of the size. That translates into rotational speed, in much the same way figure skaters spin faster when they pull in their arms.
J0002, located about 6,500 light years away in Cassiopeia, isn't quite that fast. However, it does spin at a healthy 8.7 times a second, each time producing a gamma ray burst seen from Earth. Astronomers at Einstein@Home spotted it in 2017 while sifting through gamma ray data using computer cycles borrowed from volunteers. The photo above is a composite of older images from the DRAO observatory and new observations from the VLA. The latter shows the orange pulsar tail and and curved rim of the supernova remnant.
Scientists aren't sure why J0002 is moving faster than 99 percent of measured pulsars. One theory is that the collapsing star that formed it had regions of dense matter that pulled the newly formed neutron star like a ""gravitational tugboat."" Shortly after it formed, the supernova shell outran the pulsar, but interstellar gas eventually slowed the relatively sparse debris. Meanwhile, the pulsar acted like a cannonball, piercing the remnants and escaping them about 5,000 years after the explosion.
Pulsar J0002 will eventually escape our galaxy, too. Suffice to say, you wouldn't want to be in the way -- such objects are very small (12 miles across on average), but can weigh twice as much as our sun. And at 2.5 million MPH, it could travel from the Earth to the Moon in just six minutes.

Sarah Betancourt / AP,"(BOSTON) — A major Nor’easter pounded the East Coast on Friday, packing heavy rain, intermittent snow and strong winds as residents from the mid-Atlantic to Maine braced for coastal flooding.The Eastern seaboard was expected to be buffeted by wind gusts exceeding 50 mph, with possible hurricane-strength winds of 80 to 90 mph on Cape Cod. Also, heavy snow fell in Ohio, upstate New York on eastward. Boston south to Rhode island is forecast to get 2 to 5 inches of snow from the late-winter storm. Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker activated 200 National Guard members to help with the storm. “We’re expecting to see more severe flooding issues here than we did in the Jan. 4 storm,” when a Nor’easter lashed the region with heavy snow and rain, he said. Residents were taking matters into their own hands. In Duxbury, south of Boston, officials urged people to evacuate as soon as possible, and the fire department was preparing to use a high water rescue vehicle for the first time to help any residents who wind up stuck in homes during high floodwaters. Michelle Shaffer, 45, of the coastal Massachusetts town of Hull, lost her appliances under 5 feet of water during the last big storm. “I have a new washer, and my boyfriend just built a wooden platform for it. We got a couple of sump pumps,” said Shaffer, who evacuated to higher ground Thursday night. “This storm is going to be worse because it’s going over three high tides,” she said. The Coast Guard advised boaters to exercise “vigilance and extreme caution.” The National Weather Service warned that the storm would morph into heavier, wet snow later Friday. In New Jersey, officials worried that the storm could take a chunk out of beaches just south of Atlantic City that are still being repaired because of damage from previous storms. Winds were expected to increase drastically throughout the day, peaking Friday afternoon with gusts from 50 mph to 60 mph that could leave downed trees and power lines. The heaviest snowfall is expected to be in parts of western New York into northern Pennsylvania, with 8 to 12 inches likely. Across the East Coast, authorities told residents of coastal communities to be prepared to evacuate if necessary in advance of Friday morning’s high tide. The weather service said all of Rhode Island was under flood and high wind watches through Sunday morning. Airlines were making their own preparations. Delta, Southwest, JetBlue and American Airlines were allowing travelers to change their Friday and Saturday flights ahead of time to avoid delays and cancellations at key airports across the Northeast. Regional power utilities said they had extra crews on standby to deal with expected outages.","(BOSTON) — A major Nor’easter pounded the East Coast on Friday, packing heavy rain, intermittent snow and strong winds as residents from the mid-Atlantic to Maine braced for coastal flooding.

Rhett Allain,"Who doesn't love a good slow motion video? The Slow Mo Guys —Gav and Dan—sure do! In this video of theirs, they use a high speed camera to capture the motion of four different bullets. And lucky for me, the motion looks to be perfect for a video analysis: They give both a reference scale (the black and white markers in the back) as well as the frame rate (100,000 frames per second). Let's just jump right into an analysis. I will be using Tracker Video Analysis to get position and time data for each bullet after it leaves the weapon. The bullets are so small that it can be difficult to always see them—for all but the largest bullets, I can only mark the bullets when they are passing in front of the white backgrounds. Still, this should be enough for an analysis. Now for the data. I marked all the bullet positions so you don't have to. Here's a plot of position vs. time for each one ( you can also view the plotly version ). I'm pretty happy with this—however, there is a problem. During the video, Gav and Dan switched from the slow-mo view back to a commentary view because the 45 caliber bullet was taking too long. When they switched back to the slow motion view, their timing was off. You can see this in a graph of position vs. time for that bullet. Oh, you can also notice the missing data when the bullet passed in front of the black parts of the background. But how off is it? Let me first make the assumption that the bullet has a constant velocity in the horizontal direction. If this is the case, then a linear fit to the first part of the data gives a speed of 287.6 m/s. I should add that this speed would convert to 642 mph, which is faster than the speed listed on the video at 577 mph. Perhaps the displayed frame rate is different than the recorded frame rate? Maybe Gav and Dan could give me the answer here. Anyway, back to the data. From the linear fit, I get the following equation of motion for the bullet. This equation of motion should give the position of the bullet for any time. The ""jump"" time is at 0.00825 seconds. The constant velocity equation says that the bullet should have a position of 1.795 meters but the data from the video puts it at 1.886 meters. What about the reverse of this problem? If I know that the position is 1.886, what time should it be? That's a pretty straightforward problem to solve (algebraically). You can do that for yourself as a homework assignment, but I get a correct time of 0.008567 seconds. So, they were ""late"" by 0.000317 seconds. But wait! That's how far they were off in ""real"" time, but the video was played back in slow motion. It was recorded at 100,000 fps—but I assume it was displayed at 30 fps. That means this short time interval was actually off by 1 second. That's the mistake. But that's just a cosmetic error, not really what I wanted to look at. Instead, I want to know if it's possible to estimate the amount of air resistance on these bullets as they leave the muzzle. I have to admit that air resistance on bullets can be pretty tricky. When these suckers are moving super fast, the simpler models for air resistance don't always work. But no matter what, an air drag force on a bullet should push in the opposite direction of the motion of the bullet and slow it down. So I will see if I can estimate the acceleration of the bullet during this short flight. In one dimension, the acceleration is defined as the change in velocity divided by the change in time. That can be written as the following equation. I just need to find the velocity at the beginning of the trajectory and then at the end. This will just be the slope of the position-time graph at these two points. Then I can divide by the time of flight for a rough approximation of the acceleration. Here's what I get: Barrett: v 1 = 934 m/s, v 2 = 854 m/s, Δt = 0.0051 sec, acceleration = 15,686 m/s 2. This seems very high. AK-47: v 1 = 752 m/s, v 2 = 698 m/s, Δt = 0.0062 sec, acceleration = 8710 m/s 2. 45 cal: v 1 = 246 m/s, v 2 = 242 m/s, Δt = 0.012 sec, acceleraiton = 333 m/s 2. 9 mm: v 1 = 351 m/s, v 2 = 330 m/s, Δt = 0.0105 sec, acceleration = 2000 m/s 2. Since these values for the acceleration seem super high, I am going to roughly estimate the acceleration using a basic model for air drag. Here is the equation I will use: In this expression, ρ is the density of air (about 1.2 kg/m 3 ), A is the cross sectional area of the bullet and C is the drag coefficient. I can approximate the bullet size and mass from this wikipedia page and I will just use a drag coefficient of 0.295. With these values and the velocity right out of the barrel, I get an acceleration of 624 m/s. OK, that is high—but not quite as high as the measured acceleration. Still, I think the values from the video aren't super crazy. That bullet is moving really fast and interacting with the air that will make it slow down quite a bit—especially at first. Of course ballistics physics can get pretty complicated, but that will never stop me from making some rough estimates.",It's time to do some physics-based forensics.,2018-02-07T13:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Something's Off About This Slow-Motion Bullet Video,https://www.wired.com/story/somethings-off-about-this-slow-motion-bullet-video/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a7a53c4718a58091f20e07c/191:100/pass/slowmobullet.jpg,wired,Wired,mph,1

JAY REEVES and TAMARA LUSH / AP,"(MEXICO BEACH, Fla.) — The small Gulf Coast community of Mexico Beach was known as a slice of Old Florida. Now it lies in splinters. Hit head-on by Hurricane Michael, homes in this town of about 1,190 people were shattered or ripped from their foundations. Boats were tossed like toys. The streets closest to the water looked as if a bomb had gone off. What the 9-foot storm surge didn’t destroy, the 155 mph (250 kph) winds finished off. Now, rescuers and residents are struggling to get into the ground-zero town to assess the damage and search for the hundreds of people believed to have stayed behind. Mishelle McPherson and her ex-husband looked for the elderly mother of a friend on Thursday. The woman lived in a small cinderblock house about 150 yards from the Gulf and thought she would be OK. Her home was reduced to crumbled cinderblocks and pieces of floor tile. “Aggy! Aggy!” McPherson yelled. The only sound that came back was the echo from the half-demolished building and the pounding of the surf. “Do you think her body would be here? Do you think it would have floated away?” she asked. As she walked down the street, McPherson pointed out pieces of what had been the woman’s house: “That’s the blade from her ceiling fan. That’s her floor tile.” Drone footage of Mexico Beach on Thursday morning showed a stunning landscape of devastation. Few structures were unscathed. John Humphress, a storm chaser and drone pilot, arrived in Mexico Beach around 5 p.m. Wednesday, a few hours after Michael slammed into the coastline. He had one word to describe what he saw: “Apocalyptic.” State officials said 285 people in Mexico Beach had refused to leave ahead of the hurricane despite a mandatory evacuation order. A National Guard team went into the area and found 20 survivors overnight, and more crews were pushing into the area on Thursday. The fate of many other residents was unknown, authorities said. Humphress, who spent the night in his truck on a bridge near Mexico Beach, said he didn’t see anyone dead. On Thursday, residents who evacuated tried to return. The Rev. Eddie LaFountain, pastor at First Baptist Church in Mexico Beach, was one of them. He described the place as a “good family resort town” that attracts visitors seeking peace and quiet rather than the spring break-like atmosphere of other communities along the 200-mile Florida Panhandle. Most of the full-time residents, he said, have some connection to the hospitality industry. Some operate vacation home rentals, while others work jobs cleaning and maintaining the homes. Others own or work in restaurants, rent out kayaks or operate charter fishing boats. LaFountain himself has a lawn-mowing business. Despite the widespread destruction, LaFountain said he believes most people will rebuild. “I think the people here have a great heart and a lot of resilience. We call them stubborn and hard-headed. I think they will be back,” LaFountain said in a phone interview while driving back to Mexico Beach. A Florida hurricane expert said the footage of buildings in Mexico Beach stripped to their concrete foundations was no surprise. “This is what we expect with storm surge and high wind events,” said Craig Fugate, former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a former emergency management chief for the state of Florida. Florida has some of the most stringent hurricane building codes in the country, but they apply only to new or retrofitted structures. Mexico Beach is on the west end of what’s called Florida’s Forgotten Coast, so named because it is not heavily developed like many of the state’s other shoreline areas, with their lavish homes and high-rise condos and hotels. U.S. Route 98 runs right along the coast, where a few beachside restaurants offer oysters and other seafood, cocktails and a view of the Gulf of Mexico. Other communities along the Forgotten Coast include Port St. Joe, Apalachicola, Eastpoint, St. Marks and St. George Island, all places where folks from nearby Tallahassee, Georgia and Alabama like to escape for quiet weekends. As Republican Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted: “Mexico Beach is an old old #Florida town. It’s charm is that it feels like a trip back in time to a place unspoiled by development. I was told this morning that is is ‘gone.'” ___ Tamara Lush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida, Brendan Farrington from Tallahassee, Florida, and Jennifer Kay and Curt Anderson from Miami.","Hurricane Michael decimated the town of Mexico Beach, Fla., with wind gusts of 155 mph and 9-foot storm surges.",2018-10-11T21:24:42Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",It’s ‘Gone’: How Hurricane Michael Swiftly Flattened One Florida Town,http://time.com/5422631/how-hurricane-michael-flattened-mexico-beach-florida/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/hurricane-michael-damage-mexico-beach-florida.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,mph,1
Matt Jancer,"The first fully autonomous ground vehicles hitting the market aren’t cars or delivery trucks—they’re ­robo­-farmhands. The Dot Power Platform is a prime example of an explosion in advanced agricultural technology, which Goldman Sachs predicts will raise crop yields 70 percent by 2050. But Dot isn’t just a tractor that can drive without a human for backup. It’s the Transformer of ag-bots, capable of performing 100-plus jobs, from hay baler and seeder to rock picker and manure spreader, via an ­arsenal of tool modules. And though the hulking machine can carry 40,000 pounds, it navigates fields with balletic precision. WHAT: Dot, an autonomous ag-bot SIZE: 18 x 12 x 11 feet WEIGHT: 4.25 tons WEIGHT CAPACITY: 20 tons TOP SPEED: 12 mph Farmers map their land using an aerial drone or GPS receiver, upload that data to the Dot controller—a Microsoft Surface Pro—then unleash the beast into the field. The tireless machine can run around the clock, pausing only to refuel its 75-gallon ­diesel tank, and will save growers an estimated 20 percent in fuel, labor, and equipment costs. The first six Dots will be sold to farmers in grain-rich Saskatchewan, Canada, this spring (before a wider rollout next year). Get ready for a tech-tended bumper crop. Navigation Brain If the machine encounters an object that wasn’t included on the drone or satellite mapping imagery, it stops and beams a video to its remote operator. Mounting Arms The farmer uses a remote control to position Dot alongside the desired tool attachment, such as a seeder. Then four hydraulic arms hoist and secure the apparatus.

Connie Loizos,"Last night, super entrepreneur and Twitter addict Elon Musk posted some mesmerizing footage of the tunnel that his nearly two-year-old infrastructure company, Boring Company, is creating in Los Angeles right now, the first of four planned projects that Musk promises will reduce congestion in car-choked city cities. Musk also tweeted — not for the first time — that the company will unveil to the public the stretch of rapid-transit tunnel in the southern L.A. suburb of Hawthorne on December 10th, roughly five weeks from now. The idea, per Musk, is to host an opening event that night, followed by free rides for the public next day — though only the brave need apply. Musk has said previously that the system will be capable of whisking pedestrians, cyclists and private vehicles at speeds of up to 155 mph. Eventually, if all goes as planned, they will travel via an electric-powered platform called a skate that will comprise either a vehicle itself carrying up to 16 passengers or that will support a car that has been driven onto it. Elevators will move between these skates and the street level.

Pioneer Staff Report,"""The dangerously cold wind chills will cause frostbite in as little as 10 minutes to exposed skin,"" the weather service warning said. The forecast calls for overnight wind chills to range from 30 to 45 below zero throughout north-central and northwest Minnesota, as well as northeast and southeast North Dakota. According to The American Red Cross, frostbite occurs when there is freezing of a specific body part, such as fingers, nose or ear lobes, which are often exposed to the cold, or the toes, which although they may be covered, often see symptoms of frostbite. Hypothermia is another cold-related emergency and may quickly become life-threatening. Hypothermia is linked to the cooling of the body because of the failure of the body's warming system. Symptoms include shivering, numbness, glassy stare, as well as apathy, weakness, impaired judgment and, ultimately, loss of consciousness. The forecast for the Bemidji area calls for Tuesday's ""high temperature"" to be only near 10 below, with wind chills as low as 45 below. The temperature will continue to drop to about 23 below Tuesday night, with wind chills about 36 below. Here's a look at the rest of the week's weather service forecast: • Wednesday: Mostly sunny, with a high near 2 below. Light and variable wind becoming south around 5 mph in the afternoon. • Wednesday night: A 40 percent chance of snow after 1 a.m. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 12 below. Southeast wind around 6 mph. • Thursday: A 40 percent chance of snow, mainly before 1 p.m. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 4. Southeast wind around 6 mph. • Thursday night: A slight chance of snow before 7 p.m., then a slight chance of snow after 1 a.m. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 13 below.

Tom McKay,"Self-declared Flat Earth researcher and DIY steam rocket enthusiast “Mad” Mike Hughes has finally managed to prove the haters wrong about his ability to blast himself some 1,875 feet into the sky without being crushed or scalded to death, the Associated Press reported on Sunday. After the failure of two previous attempts to launch his steam-powered rocket with “RESEARCH FLAT EARTH” emblazoned on the side—first due to meddling government bureaucrats and then due to unspecified technical problems —Hughes finally managed to take off on Saturday from the Mojave Desert ghost town of Amboy, California. Video of the launch posted by AP freelancer Matt Hartman captured the moment the rocket took off, which seemed to take onlookers by surprise, including a nearby group of boys who appeared to be idly throwing rocks into a bigger pile of rocks. Here’s video from another angle shot by Amboy town manager Carlos Aceves, as well as footage of Hughes being extracted from the rocket by paramedics, via Route 66 News : After the Bureau of Land Management nixed his first attempt for a flight path that would have taken him over public land, Hughes modified his rocket to use an improvised vertical launch platform. Per the AP, hel Waldo Stakes said that they were only able to get the steam rocket to 340 psi instead of the planned 350 psi, but went ahead with the launch anyway because Hughes wanted to avoid yet another failed attempt and dispel rumors he wasn’t actually on board a previous rocket he managed to launch in 2014. Stakes estimated the speed at 350 mph. Hughes told the AP that outside of an aching back, he was fine and felt “relieved” the rocket launch was over. “I’m tired of people saying I chickened out and didn’t build a rocket,” he added. “I’m tired of that stuff. I manned up and did it... This thing wants to kill you 10 different ways. This thing will kill you in a heartbeat.” “Am I glad I did it?” Hughes concluded. “Yeah. I guess. I’ll feel it in the morning. I won’t be able to get out of bed. At least I can go home and have dinner and see my cats tonight.” Whatever calculations Hughes, who does not “ believe in science,” performed is not a matter of public record. But Stakes estimated the speed at around 350 mph, which is definitely fast enough to secure bragging rights. The AP noted the triumphant rocketeer’s future plans include building a “Rockoon,” which sounds like an air-launched rocket that involves a balloon instead of a plane and is apparently intended to get him high enough into the air to test his Flat Earth theory ( 68 miles, well above the breathable atmosphere and the Armstrong Limit where all bodily fluids would boil away in an unpressurized environment). Also he’s gonna run for governor, because sure, whatever.

Brett Williams,"Volvo's parent company envisions a world where in two years time, real-life flying cars could be hitting the open roads (and skies), finally fulfilling all of our sci-fi inspired fantasies of bi-modal travel. Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, the Chinese parent of auto brands Volvo and Lotus, just finalized its latest acquisition to snap up next-gen transportation startup Terrafugia. The company is best known for its futuristic flying car designs, the Transition and the TF-X — and with the new corporate support from Geely, Terrafugia is ready to set new targets for the crafts to be ready for flight. Terrafugia says that it will aim to offer consumers a shot at personal street-to-sky transport by releasing the Transition to the market in 2019, then following up with the more accessible TF-X rig by 2023. SEE ALSO: Video shows what Uber's flying taxis will look like The two vehicles promise to offer drivers... er, flyers, different experiences to get in the air. The Transition, which has been in development since 2009, has retractable wings and requires a full runway to take off into the skies. Terrafugia has already shown off footage of a working prototype, which the company has flown in OshKosh, Wisconsin. The company says the final production version of the craft will have a cruising speed of 100 mph, with about 400 miles of flight range. You can even reserve one now, if you're willing to wait two years and fork over $10,000. Terrafugia founder Carl Dietrich told us the final cost will probably be around $279,000 back in 2013, however, so the down payment isn't that much, considering. The TF-X is a different beast. The vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) craft is closer to the flying taxi designs shown off recently by Uber and flown in Dubai than the Transition, since it won't require a runway to get airborne. Unlike those VTOLs, however, the TF-X retains the ability to drive on the roads, making it a true flying car. Terrafugia says the TF-X will run on an all-electric system, with an estimated cruising speed of 200 mph and range of 500 miles. While the company says it'll be more accessible to consumers by the time it's fully developed, cost estimates haven't been specified. For now, expect the TF-X to cost around as much as a high-end luxury car. The plans to launch flying taxis by Uber and the city of Dubai depend on public programs to put the vehicles into service around 2020— but private crafts like these from Terrafugia and competitors like AeroMobil and Lilium could give wealthy enthusiasts a chance to get in the air first. Either way, our skies may be about to get more crowded.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":""Are you ready to fly with Uber?"",""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/az0i8uqa6v7fcxnwNkeb0kSpAMc=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fvideo_uploaders%2Fdistribution_thumb%2Fimage%2F82923%2F9…",2017-11-14T19:45:39Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",Volvo's parent company wants to sell you a flying car by 2019,http://mashable.com/2017/11/14/geely-acquires-terrafugia-flying-car-2019/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RZyjZ4YdWMtPACs6I3QH24Hm344=/1200x630/2017%2F11%2F14%2Fde%2Ff53cde99230940aca271e385635aa40b.d5b8e.jpg,mashable,Mashable,mph,1
Rhett Jones,"Virgin Hyperloop One is currently courting investment in Saudi Arabia with an eye toward building one of its high-speed transports in the Kingdom. But trouble at the top of the company threatens to shake investor confidence. One Hyperloop director of the board was arrested over the weekend, and on Monday, three others were replaced. Bloomberg reports : A list of directors that was updated on the company’s website Monday showed three members stepped down from the 10-person board: Jim Messina, a former adviser to President Barack Obama; Jim Rosenthal, a former Morgan Stanley executive; and Peter Diamandis, founder of X Prize. New board members are Bill Shor of Caspian Venture Capital; Yuvraj Narayan, chief financial officer of DP World; and Anatoly Braverman of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund. The changes were made several weeks ago, a person familiar with the situation said. In terms of prestige and name-recognition, it’s safe to say that Hyperloop’s board is experiencing a downgrade. One board member that hasn’t changed on the company’s website is billionaire tycoon Ziyavudin Magomedov, but his slot may soon need to be filled because he was arrested in Moscow on reportedly unrelated charges of fraud and embezzlement on Saturday. The company’s general counsel, Marvin Ammori, also reportedly left recently. It’s unclear at the moment why the members who left voluntarily chose to do so right now. We’ve reached out to Virgin Hyperloop One for comment and will update this post when we receive a reply. As for Magomedov, his arrest appears to be unrelated to any business dealings involving Hyperloop. The businesses he owns, like Far Eastern Shipping Co, took hits in Russian markets of up to 21 percent. In Russia, corruption is often seen as a prerequisite to making it to the top of an oligarchical system, and charges like this are regularly assumed to have political motivations. According to Bloomberg, Magomedov denied all charges when he appeared in court. It’s not exactly surprising to hear about trouble for Hyperloop. In recent months, we’ve seen its co-founder, Shervin Pishevar, step down following accusations of sexual harassment. Magomedov was co-chairman of the board with Pishevar before Richard Branson stepped in with an $85 million cash injection and subsequently took over the top board position. On top of those changes, Brent Callinicos, the company’s CFO, and its senior vice president for hardware engineering, Carl Jenkins, departed early last month. Hyperloop is trying to pioneer a complicated business filled with regulatory hurdles, no matter what country it works with. Its technology is still in the testing phase, with a run in December reaching speeds of 240 MPH. The ultimate goal of 700 MPH is still a long way off. And it’s hard to tell if Elon Musk’s Boring Company is a friend to the Virgin Hyperloop One or a potential competitor. That kind of development would certainly be a blow to Branson’s ego as he’s also watched Musk’s SpaceX rocket company chalk up numerous victories while Virgin Galactic has struggled to get its suborbital spaceflight business off the ground.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Hurricane Lane continues to bear down on Hawaii, posing a catastrophic threat to residents and tourists alike. The storm could bring hurricane force winds to the Aloha State for the first time in 26 years, along with pounding surf and torrential rain. Hawaii has only seen three hurricanes reach its shores in the historical record. That could end up being both a blessing and a curse for residents living on the island as they prepare. “Risks that feel unknown to an individual can increase someone’s risk perception, and perhaps, increase their attention to messages,” Gina Eosco, a social scientist supporting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Office of Weather and Air Quality, told Earther. “On the other hand, given the rarity of such an event, some individuals may feel, ‘it won’t happen here.’ In other words, they’re using optimism bias.” As of Thursday at 2 a.m. local time, Hurricane Lane was packing winds of 130 mph, making it a very dangerous Category 4. Every island is under a hurricane watch or warning and forecasters are calling for 10-20 inches of rain over a large area. Some spots could pick up 30 inches—nearly double Honolulu’s yearly rainfall—with rainfall rates approaching 4 inches per hour. Hilo has already recorded nearly a foot of rain, and landslides have been reported. Lane is chugging along at just 7 mph, allowing it to stir up large swells, and storm surge could top out at four feet. To cap all this off, the strongest winds, rains, and surge impacts tend to occur on a hurricane’s northeast flank because of the way tropical cyclones rotate in the central Pacific. That’s right where the Hawaiian islands sit relative to Lane. This is the most dire forecast Hawaii has faced since Hurricane Iniki made landfall in Kauai in 1992. That storm caused $3.1 billion in damage and left an indelible mark on Hawaiians’ memories. Having it as a touchstone could help ensure Hawaiians take Lane seriously. “Hawaiians are pretty akamai, clued up,” John Marra, director of NOAA Pacific Regional Climate Services, told Earther. “The impacts [of Iniki] imprinted on a lot of folks.... We’re a little bit more aware than you might think.” That awareness already has Hawaiians following the same sorts of preparations you’d expect to see along the Gulf Coast: boarding up windows, filling up gas tanks, and stocking up on water and food. The state has requested and the federal government has already granted a disaster declaration, which could speed the response after the storm passes. All that being said, Karl Kim, the head of the University of Hawaii’s National Disaster Preparedness Training Center, pointed out that certain groups remain very vulnerable. “[P]oor people, homeless, persons with disabilities, seniors, and immigrant communities may be at-greater risk,” Kim told Earther. A May 2018 count estimates there are 6,530 homeless people across the islands. Police in Honolulu are canvassing tent communities urging homeless to seek shelter ahead of the storm, but there are a lot of people to reach and not a lot of time left. People living in poverty could also wind up homeless after the storm, something Houston saw in the wake of Harvey. Even the best preparations could still underestimate the impacts of Lane. Marra said the breadth of areas that will likely see massive rainfall totals could stretch resources thinner and leave people forced to fend for themselves for longer in flooded, muddy conditions. Then there’s the infrastructure on the ground. The state also upgraded its building codes in 2010 so that all new residential construction must withstand wind gusts of up to 130 mph. But older buildings don’t have to be up to that code and are at-risk from both winds and flooding. If those homes collapse or roofs rip off, the flying debris could put anyone in harm’s way. Marra also raised concerns about compound flooding from storm surge and rain that would have nowhere to go except into people’s basements. All of which is to say, Lane could test Hawaii in ways Iniki did as well as new ways. If you’re in Hawaii, pay attention to the forecast and stay safe.","Hurricane Lane continues to bear down on Hawaii, posing a catastrophic threat to residents and tourists alike.

Benjamin Zhang,"The 2019 BMW M5 Competition Sedan. BMW BMW's legendary M5 sports sedan just got even better. On Tuesday, the Bavarian automaker unveiled the new 2019 BMW M5 Competition Sedan. With a 617 horsepower, 4.4-liter, turbocharged V8 under the hood, it's the most powerful M5 ever produced. According to BMW, the Competition Sedan can hit 60 mph in a brisk 3.1 seconds while the sprint to 124 mph from a standstill happens in just 10.8 seconds. The Bimmer will eventually reach an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph. However, an optional M Driver's package can raise that top speed to 189 mph. The M5 puts its power to the pavement through an eight-speed M Steptronic automatic transmission and a rear-wheel-biased intelligent all-wheel-drive. BMW The M5 Competition Sedan along with the recently introduced M2 Competition Coupe will form a new sub-segment of uber-hot performance machines within BMW's vaunted M division. As a result, the M5 Competition Sedan gets 17 more horsepower from the 4.4-liter V8 and can do 60 mph in 0.1 seconds quicker than the standard M5. In addition, the Competition Sedan receives a modified high-flow exhaust system, firmer engine mounts, lower ride height, redesigned anti-roll bar mounts, lightweight alloy wheels, and optional carbon ceramic brakes. BMW The M5 Competition will also receive exclusive design features like black high-gloss finishes on the door handles and M5 badging. The interior gets new seat belts and floor mats with BMW M logos. There's also an M Competition graphic that pops up on the instrument cluster at startup. The 2019 BMW M5 Competition Sedan enters production this July and will carry a starting price of $110,995.

Adrienne So,"This seems obvious, but most electric vehicles still feel like non-electric vehicles. If you know how to ride a bike, you also know how to ride an electric bike. If you can ride a skateboard, odds are you can probably figure out an electric skateboard. However, the Onewheel+, and now its update, the Onewheel+ XR, operates outside of the boundaries of physics and logic. Its unlike any board I have ever ridden. The thick deck is balanced on a fat, heavy tire thats 10 inches wide and 10 inches across. When you step onto the board, the Onewheels three gyroscopes and three accelerometers kick into action. The motor starts and all of a sudden you, and the board, are held level. Future Motion Inc. founder Kyle Doerksen designed the board to feel like snowboarding in powder. It really does. Unlike, say, a Boosted Board, the Onewheels chunky tire can tackle any terrain, like sand, dirt, or gravel. Rather than using a handheld controller, the Onewheel+ XR reads minute shifts in your body positioning. If you look and slightly lean towards where you want to go, it heads in that direction. If you recoil from going too fast, or thrust your body impatiently forward, it slows down or speeds up. The board also leans as you turn, giving you that intensely satisfying carving sensation. But Ive been snowboarding, surfing, and skateboarding since I was thirteen, and the Onewheel+ XR is the first board that Ive ever been on that, well, makes me a little scared. I took a spill off the Onewheel+ XR and sprained my knee. A snowboarder friend of mine sprained his ankle. Another friend, who also skateboards and snowboards, face-planted. Which isnt to say that the Onewheel+ XR isnt enormously fun. Its just more of an extreme sports toy than it is a commuter vehicle. I recommend strapping on a helmet and some wrist guards more than I recommend riding it to work. As it turns out, stepping outside the boundaries of intuitively understood physics has consequences. Home On The Range Future Motion first debuted the Onewheel+ in 2014. In 2018, they upgraded to the Onewheel+ XR, which has a range of 12-18 miles instead of 6-8 miles, and adds about 10 percent more power to motor uphill or scooch over rough terrain. The Onewheel+ XR is a more formidable object that you might think. Its around the same size as a skateboard, at 29 inches long and a little under 10 inches across. But it weighs 26 pounds. In contrast, a folding bike weighs around 10-12 pounds. When I carry it by the indented handle under the deck, it's hard to remember not to drop it on my foot. To start, you download the Onewheel+ app, turn on the board, and connect it to your smartphone via Bluetooth. The dashboard shows stats like the boards battery level, your speed, how many miles youve ridden on each trip, and your range. You also use the app to tinker with the boards settings, or what Onewheel calls Digital Shaping. It has five different selectable profiles, ranging from Sequoia to Delirium, each with different max speeds, different levels of responsiveness, and an estimation of whether theyd be best for town or trail. Sequoia is the laziest setting, with a max speed of 12 mph, while Delirium ramps things up to a ridiculous 20 mph. I found Mission (the middle setting with a max speed of 19 mph) to be the most fun to ride and the closest approximation of making deep turns on a powder day. My husband, however, preferred setting the board to Elevated, which has a max speed of 19 mph and a looser, more responsive feel. When I first got on it, it was so fun that it was a little hard to get off. And then I realized: Its a little hard to get off the Onewheel+ XR, period. To stop, you lift up either your heel or your toe on the frontside of the board. A blue line bisects the front panel, and to make the board stop moving, you have to relieve the pressure on one of those sides. Sometimes, you lift your heel up and the board doesnt stop, depending on where your foot is, or if youre wearing flip-flops ( Nota bene : Absolutely do not wear flip-flops). Onewheel+ chief evangelist Jack Mudd told me that if things got iffy, I could always just bail and jump off with both feet. What a coincidence! ""When things get iffy, just bail"" is actually a personal motto of mine! But figuring out when to bail is also a little hard because of the Onewheel+ XRs operational quirks. For example, it can go uphill as well as downhill. When you go downhill, it will slow down if you lean back to stay upright, but go faster if you lean forward (it also has regenerative braking, which means if you slow down, the battery will recharge). But if the hill is steeper than 20 or 30 degrees, the hill will scrape the end of the board as the Onewheel+ XR tries to hold you level. And if you scrape and stop, it's hard to start again. I imagine there are some brave souls who are willing to tip forward into empty space on a motorized board to get it restarted, but those people are not me. Funnily enough, it was on a hill that I met my doom. An off-leash dog bounded towards me happily as I Onewheeled down a hill. Too many things happening at once! I forgot how to stop, then I couldn't. All of a sudden I was on the ground with a sprained knee. Pay for Play Its worth noting that my husband, an experienced surfer and snowboarder, could not be kept off the Onewheel+ XR. He also could not be stopped from detailing the Onewheel+ XRs many advantages over something like a Boosted (I know, I tried). For example, it's highly water-resistant, and you can ride it through rain and puddles. You can attach a fender, so it doesnt kick up mud or grit on you. It also has LED lights under the deck, so its safer to ride at night. The battery life is also excellent. After four days of riding for over an hour, the battery only drained to 60 percent, and went back up to 100 percent after an hour on the charger. I felt perfectly fine going on trips within 3-5 miles of my house without worrying that the battery was going to run out. I have to admit that before I fell, I was a full-on proselytizer for the Onewheel+ XR. It is unbelievably fun to ride, especially if you live near trails, or broken roads, that prevent skateboarding from being a viable activity. You only have to search Instagram for the #onewheel tag to realize that the Onewheel+ has a bit of a cult following, with people eager to showcase all sorts of probably unadvisable feats on this addictive board (WIRED fave and pro surfer Kelly Slater is reportedly a fan). However, there are risks that Im willing to take while playing around that Im just not willing to take when I have to get somewhere on time. Especially after seeing several friends take spills, and falling myself, I dont feel that I can recommend the Onewheel+ XR to just anyone. That's not to say I don't fall off skateboards and bikes all the time, but I understand how those machines work and can usually assess and manage the risk of injury. The Onewheel+ XR is truly unique, so making that call can be more difficult. If youre willing to strap on a helmet and some wrist guards, and are willing to take some time to figure out what it's all about, then you'll have a ton of fun. But if youre looking for a quick and simple electric commuting vehicle to navigate through unpredictable barking dogs and kids going to school, while listening to a podcast? In that last case, the Onewheel+ XR might not be for you, especially not with a $1800 price tag. Maybe look into electric folding bicycles? After all, its not for nothing that my friends now refer to it as the Danger Wheel.",Onewheel's latest board is more for action sports enthusiasts than casual commuters.,2018-10-05T12:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Onewheel+ XR Review: Dangerously Fun,https://www.wired.com/review/review-onewheel-xr/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5bb6af8fffac9b2ce1d57934/191:100/pass/onewheel.jpg,wired,Wired,mph,1
lukeg22woo,"Time to build a bike. Where to start? This step will outline the design process and some options I considered before finalizing a design. Then the next steps will go into detail about choosing parts and putting it all together. What kind of bike? Before you can convert a bike to an electric bike, you need the bike. The two main choices are mountain bike or road bike. Consider where you will be riding, the size of motor you're interested in, and how much pedaling you want to do. In general, mountain bikes are more stable due to wider wheels and heavier frames. Road bikes also generally don't have a suspension system, which means you'll feel every little bump. This goes from being slightly uncomfortable to painful and/or dangerous as you get up to faster speeds. So, I personally think the safer bet is a mountain bike, and you still have tons of options for getting exactly what you want out of the bike. Buy, Modify, or Build? For those on a tight budget, pulling the dusty old mountain bike out of your garage might be the best bet. Craigslist is also a great source for cheap used bikes of decent quality. For new bikes, sites like BikesDirect have some really good deals because they cut out the middle-man retailer. If you find something that's almost what you want, it may make sense to purchase that complete bike and swap out any components you want to upgrade (that's what I did). Finally, if you're feeling ambitious, you can always just collect all of the parts that make up a bike and assemble them all yourself. Depending on the size and power of your motor, it's important to make sure that your bike of choice can handle the extra stress and weight of your conversion. One last thing to mention is that building a bike up from parts is not necessarily less expensive. In fact, it's often more expensive. The tradeoff is that you get exactly what you want and don't pay for anything else. Motor - Hub motor, mid-drive, or chainsaw? Hub Motor A hub motor is one that replaces either the front or rear wheel hub (the middle part) and occasionally both wheel hubs. They are generally the lowest cost option, most discrete, and lowest powered. They are commonly sold in power ratings of 250 to 1,000 Watts. Mid-Drive Motor Mid-drive motors go - you guessed it - roughly in the middle of the bike. They generally have an extra chain that drives the front crankset, which then drives the rear wheel. One of the coolest advantages of mid-drives is that they let you shift through your rear gears as you could on a normal pedal bike. This gives you a good range of speed and torque for everything from climbing steep dirt hills to cruising along your commute to work. I've seen mid-drive motors in powers from 750 to 10,000 Watts. There is a practical limit to power here. At some point (I'd like to say it's around 3,000 W), the amount of torque and speed is just too dangerous for a bicycle. Additionally, bicycle components are usually not designed to handle super-human amounts of torque. At the very least, your components will wear faster than normal; at worst, components will break as you ride (think wheel getting bent out of shape, chain snapping, chainring bending, etc). If you really want that much power, I'd suggest a small dirt bike or motorcycle. The motor I got is the "" Cyclone 3000 "" which is rated at 3,000 W. So far that's more than enough speed and torque for me. Chainsaw Mostly kidding about this one. You certainly can take apart a chainsaw and strap the motor onto your bike to make it go, but it's probably a gas motor (not electric), so it doesn't belong in this Instructable.",<!--dda7bd42579b4dc0937c45f979fc5c69-->Hi!

Doug Phillips,"South Florida is again part of the Sunshine State — at least temporarily. The drudgery of constant rain has eased up a bit and the sun will be out on Wednesday, but that tropical disturbance heading for the Gulf of Mexico is threatening to ruin the weather for the Memorial Day weekend. The disturbance is currently a broad surface low centered just east of Belize. Because of strong upper-level winds, the system has a low chance of development over the next two days, according to the National Hurricane Center. However, environmental conditions are forecast to eventually become more conducive for development. The system has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical or subtropical depression during the next five days as it slowly moves into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane center said in an tropical weather outlook at 8 a.m. Wednesday. A big factor for South Florida is that the peninsula will be on the east side — or the wet side — of the weather system. “Regardless of development, locally heavy rainfall is possible across western Cuba, the Cayman Islands and much of Florida during the next few days, and over much of Florida and the northern Gulf Coast during the weekend,” hurricane specialist Eric Blake said in the outlook. Given that context, here is the current forecast — through Monday — from the National Weather Service : Wednesday A slight chance of showers, then a chance of showers and thunderstorms after 8am. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 84. Southeast wind 6 to 8 mph. Chance of precipitation is 30%. Wednesday Night A 30 percent chance of showers, mainly after 2 a.m. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 74. Southeast wind 5 to 7 mph. Thursday A 30 percent chance of showers. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 84. Southeast wind around 8 mph. Thursday Night Showers likely, mainly after 2 a.m. Cloudy, with a low around 74. Southeast wind around 7 mph. Chance of precipitation is 60%. Friday Showers likely. Cloudy, with a high near 82. Southeast wind 10 to 14 mph, with gusts as high as 18 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%. Friday Night Showers likely. Cloudy, with a low around 74. Southeast wind 11 to 13 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%. Saturday Showers likely. Cloudy, with a high near 82. Breezy, with a southeast wind 13 to 17 mph, with gusts as high as 23 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%. Saturday Night Showers likely. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 75. Breezy, with a southeast wind 18 to 20 mph, with gusts as high as 25 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%. Sunday Showers likely.

Zac Estrada,"Volvo is synonymous with wagons and practical transportation, but it has also made a name for itself in recent years with sleek designs. The new version of the V60 wagon carries over the theme set by the large V90 wagon that debuted two years ago. The automaker showed the new V60 — which was built on similar underpinnings as the V90, S90, and XC90 large vehicles and the XC60 midsize SUV — on Wednesday at an event in Stockholm where Volvo wagons are a staple. The V60, introduced to the US in 2014, remains a niche vehicle in North America, but it’s popular across Europe. Rivals include the Audi A4 Allroad, BMW 3-Series Sport Wagon, and even the likes of the Subaru Outback. Volvo said on Wednesday that it has upgraded its Pilot Assist driver assistance system for “improved cornering.” The system supports steering, braking, and accelerating inputs at speeds up to 80 mph. The City Safety automatic braking system now also tries to mitigate oncoming collisions. In the US, the V60 will launch as a front-wheel drive version with 250 horsepower or an all-wheel drive version with 316 horsepower (both powered by gasoline engines). Elsewhere, the V60 will also be offered as a 390-horsepower plug-in hybrid or a new plug-in hybrid variant with 340 horsepower. Expect those versions to make their way to the US at some point, given Volvo’s pledge to electrify all of its cars by 2019. The V60 will also be available in the US with the Care by Volvo subscription payment plan that launched last year with the small XC40 SUV. Owners can choose to finance, lease, or subscribe to the Volvo, with Care by Volvo covering everything except fuel under one monthly payment, and customers can choose to swap into a new Volvo in as little as 12 months. The new V60 will be built in both Sweden and Belgium this year for global markets. Its sedan counterpart, the S60, will be the first product for Volvo’s Charleston, South Carolina, assembly plant that Volvo says will start producing cars late this year. The US-built S60 will be sold around the world, too and will be offered with similar engines as the V60. While the S60 will be shown later this year, we’ll see the V60 up close next month at the Geneva Motor Show.","The 2019 Volvo V60 was shown Wednesday in Stockholm, and will be available with the company’s new Care By Volvo subscription plan.",2018-02-21T15:56:14Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",The new Volvo V60 is a sleek wagon with more semi-autonomy,https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17035672/volvo-v60-2019-wagon-reveal,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cgMaKuI0HmhoMzvZ0NWzT7YDLF8=/389x777:2403x1831/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10269341/V60_long_lead_04_copy.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,mph,1
Reuters,"Rolls-Royce's concept flying taxi. Rolls-Royce British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce has designed a propulsion system for a flying taxi and is starting a search for partners to help develop a project it hopes could take to the skies as soon as early next decade. Rolls-Royce said on Sunday it had drawn up plans for an electric vertical take-off and landing (EV TOL) vehicle, or flying taxi, which could carry four to five people at speeds of up to 250 mph for approximately 500 miles. The company, which makes engines for planes, helicopters, and ships, joins a variety of companies racing to develop flying taxis, which could revolutionize the way people travel. Long the stuff of science fiction and futuristic cartoons such as ""The Jetsons,"" aviation and technology leaders are working to make electric-powered flying taxis a reality, including Airbus, US ride-sharing firm Uber, and a range of start-ups including one backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, called Kitty Hawk. Rolls-Royce's design will be showcased in digital form at the Farnborough Airshow, which starts on Monday. The company is looking for an airframer and a partner to provide aspects of the electrical system to help commercialize the project. Rolls-Royce said in a statement it was well-placed to play a leading role in the ""personal air mobility"" market. ""The initial concept vehicle uses gas turbine technology to generate electricity to power six electric propulsors specially designed to have a low noise profile,"" the company said, adding the design used its existing M250 gas turbine. Rolls's design would not require re-charging because the battery is charged by the gas turbine, it said, adding it could use existing infrastructure such as heliports and airports.",Rolls-Royce British jet engine giant Rolls-Royce has joined the race to build a flying taxi.

Andrew Joseph,"I imagine that staring down a big-league pitcher from 60.5 feet away is an incredibly nerve-racking experience. You have dudes like Jordan Hicks who can throw 105 mph with erratic control at times. Brewers infielder Hernan Perez did not present that issue to Austin Barnes on Sunday. The slowest hit by pitch in @MLB history? pic.twitter.com/yDrVS9UE4R — Cut4 (@Cut4) July 22, 2018 With Milwaukee down nine runs in the seventh inning and looking to preserve its bullpen, it brought Perez (again, a position player) in to pitch. He didn't exactly bring the heat to Barnes. The Dodgers catcher was hit with perhaps the slowest pitch you'll see a major-leaguer throw: a 48 mph slider. Yeah, that one didn't leave a mark. Oddly enough, the pitch came immediately after an 87 mph fastball - the only time Perez broke 80 mph in his appearance. He must have wanted to keep Barnes off-balanced. But hey, Perez did manage to escape the inning unscathed.

By Jim Shay,"In days ahead, there’s snow in the forecast Rain that will be moving into the region on Thursday, is expected to change to snow late tonight. While the National Weather Service says snow accumulation will be less than an inch, it could cause some problems for Friday morning’s commute. “A cold front approaches from the west today and passes through the region tonight,” the NWS says, “Precipitation is expected to start as rain, but as cold air filters in behind the front a transition to snow is anticipated late tonight into Friday morning.” The hourly forecast says the best chance of rain is between 8 p.m. Thursday to around 1 a.m. Friday. Snow is likely between 1 and 5 a.m. Friday, followed by a chance of snow to 8 a.m. That timing could cause some school delays on Friday; closings are unlikely. Friday will be cold and windy. Temperatures will be falling into the low 20s by 5 p.m. Friday. Northwest winds between 10 and 20 mph and gusts up to 28 mph, will create windchill values between 10 and 20 degrees. Saturday will be mostly sunny with a high in the upper 20s. Snow is expected Sunday morning into early afternoon before changing into rain. The NWS says the rain will turn back to snow early Monday morning. In its weather discussion, the NWS says, “for now too early to specify amounts, but there is some potential for an advisory level to possibly a warning level snowfall across mainly northern interior zones from Sunday into Monday morning.” According to the Northeast Regional Climate Center, snowfall has been above average in January. Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Stratford received 11.4 inches, nearly four inches above average. So far, total snowfall for this winter at Sikorsky airport is 20.1 inches or 6.6 above average this time of season. Sikorsky averages about 28 inches of snow a year. January’s average temperature was 1.5 degrees below normal for Sikorsky airport. Danbury’s average temperature in January was 26.1 degrees -exactly where it should be.

Jake Holmes,"The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety released its latest batch of test results on Thursday, showing how well popular new crossovers' pedestrian-detection systems work. The IIHS put 11 models from the 2018 and 2019 model years through a series of tests to see whether and how well the cars' safety systems brake to avoid hitting pedestrians.
The IIHS rated the vehicles as follows: The top Superior rating went to the Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4 and Volvo XC40. The Advanced rating was awarded to the Chevrolet Equinox, Hyundai Kona, Mazda CX-5, Kia Sportage and Nissan Rogue. The Mitsubishi Outlander scored Basic, the second-worst result, and the BMW X1 was at the bottom of the list with a ""No Credit"" score.
The RAV4 was one of four crossovers to earn the IIHS' highest Superior rating.
Nick Miotke/Roadshow
The IIHS used three separate tests to evaluate the crossovers' performance. In the first test, an adult-sized dummy walks into the roadway ahead of the oncoming car, with the test performed with the car driving at both 12 and 25 miles per hour. In a second test, which is run at the same speeds, the dummy is instead a child, which ""runs"" out from between two parked vehicles in front of the car. And in the final test, vehicles travel at 25 and 37 mph as they approach a pedestrian who's walking along the roadway in the same direction the vehicle is traveling (called the ""parallel test"").
Passing those tests wasn't easy for the crossovers. The Forester and RAV4 were the only models to avoid hitting the dummy in each of the first two tests. The XC40 managed to stop in the adult test at 12 and 25 mph, and in the child test at 12 mph.
""The best possible outcome is to avoid hitting a pedestrian altogether,"" David Aylor, IIHS manager for active safety testing, said in a statement. ""When a crash is unavoidable, sharply reducing a vehicle's travel speed would give someone on foot a far greater chance of surviving any injuries in a similar real-world encounter with a passenger vehicle.""
The Mitsubishi Outlander and BMW X1 showed the worst performance. The former only managed to slow by about 19 mph in the 25-mph parallel tests and by 11 mph in the 12-mph child test, with ""only minimal speed reductions"" in other tests. The X1 ""had minimal to no speed reductions"" in most tests and didn't brake at all in the 37-mph parallel test.
Pedestrian-detection systems are important -- pedestrian fatalities remain high on American roads. The IIHS says that such fatalities in 2016 were at the highest level since 1990, though they declined by 2 percent in 2017. Still, with IIHS studies showing that distracted driving is still prevalent and that General Motors' automatic emergency braking tech reduces crashes, there's ample evidence that pedestrian-detection features could help save lives.",But the BMW X1 and Mitsubishi Outlander fared poorly in avoiding dummies.,2019-02-21T15:02:32Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}","CR-V, Forester, RAV4, XC40 ace IIHS pedestrian-detection test - Roadshow",https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/iihs-pedestrian-detection-crash-testing/,https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/z3ZAllJYOupKWXpPyDbNHJqpF6c=/2019/01/18/2600aa50-71ff-4351-82c4-aba5494c1799/2019-toyota-rav4-hybrid-limited-ogi-2.jpg,,Cnet.com,mph,1

Katie Reilly,"Passengers on a Norwegian Cruise Line ship traveling toward Florida experienced extreme wind Sunday night that caused the ship to tilt to its side, injuring some passengers.
The Norwegian Escape encountered “a sudden, extreme gust of wind” estimated at 115 miles per hour, and several passengers were injured as the ship tilted to its port side, the cruise line said in a series of tweets.
“Several injuries were reported and those guests and crew received immediate attention or are being treated by the ship’s medical staff,” Norwegian Cruise Line said on Twitter on Monday. “There was no damage to the ship; she remains fully operational and continues her scheduled itinerary.”
The ship, which holds about 4,200 passengers and 1,700 crew members, was not damaged, and it arrived at Port Canaveral, Fla. on Tuesday.
Videos captured on board the ship during the intense weather show passengers screaming and trying to steady themselves, as furniture slides across the floor and glasses crash to the ground.
Passenger Aaron Black shared a video from a piano bar on the ship, showing tables sliding across the floor, liquor bottles falling off the bar and passengers struggling to cross the room without falling. He described seeing “injuries and a lot of broken glass all around the ship.”
“I remember thinking about how calm it was for sailing out of New York in March and suddenly we got hit by a large gust of wind and the whole ship kind of just tilted to the side for about 30 seconds,” Black told CNN. “Suddenly everything around me was starting to move.”

Rosie Perper,"Super Typhoon Mangkhut is hurtling through the Pacific, boasting 180 mph winds threatening millions of people across Asia in what is estimated to be one of the strongest systems on record. The system is currently hovering some 280 miles (450 kilometers) from the Philippines, and is approaching fast. According to the Global Disaster Alert and Coodination System ( GDACS ), the Philippines, Vietnam, the Chinese regions of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau would be affected. It added that nearly 37 million people are estimated to be in Mangkhut's path. GDACS estimates that the typhoon will have a ""high humanitarian impact"" based on the high wind speeds and the exposed population located in vulnerable areas. Mangkhut, which is equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, has prompted mass evacuations in the Philippines. Lt. Gen. Emmanuel Salamat, commander of North Luzon forces, said 2,000 families have been evacuated from their homes as of Friday. Tens of thousands more have been evacuated from China's Guangdong, CNN reported. The super typhoon is expected to touch down on the Philippines' largest island of Luzon on Saturday. Philippines flagship airline cancelled flights to cities in northern Luzon. Philippine budget airline Cebu Pacific, along with multiple Hong Kong airlines including Cathay Pacific, also announced flight changes. Philippine Civil Defense chief Ricardo Jalad said during an emergency meeting that about 4.2 million people in the northeastern Cagayan province are vulnerable from the typhoon, which has an eye measuring 78 miles (125 kilometers) across. According to GDACS, the storm formed over the north-west Pacific Ocean last Friday, and strengthened as it moved over the Mariana Islands and the US territory of Guam. The typhoon left parts of Guam without electricity, as well as knocked down power poles, destroyed houses, uprooted trees, and flooded large areas, the local newspaper Pacific Daily News reported. A satellite image of Typhoon Mangkhut in the Pacific Ocean, taken on Thursday morning. Japan Meteorological Agency via University of Wisconsin-Madison Bureau of Meteorology Australia tropical climatologist Greg Browning told news.com.au that Mangkhut is the most powerful storm system to have developed this year on earth. ""It's extremely dangerous as it's a very large system with very strong winds and a potential storm surge over a large distance. There will be very heavy rainfall associated with it which has potential to cause widespread damage."" The South China Morning Post on Wednesday reported that the system is already stronger any of the 15 past severe or super typhoons that were given the highest No 10 warning signal, and looks set to be one of the strongest to ever it Southeast Asia. The Philippines is expecting Mangkhut to be as strong as Super Typhoon Haiyan, which struck the island in 2013 and left more than 6,300 people dead. On Friday, Philippine residents in the northeast province of Cagayan reported experiencing strong winds and heavy rain. Across the world, extreme weather is surging. In the US, Hurricane Florence arrived in North Carolina, bringing massive floods and hurricane-force winds with a maximum sustained speed of 90 mph in what the US National Hurricane Center has warned could be a ""catastrophic"" situation.

MARCO UGARTE / AP,"(MAZATLAN, Mexico) — Hurricane Willa roared into a cluster of Mexican islands holding a prison colony and headed for a Tuesday afternoon collision with a stretch of the country’s Pacific coast, its 125 mph (205 kph) winds and high waves threatening high-rise resorts, surfing beaches and fishing villages. Willa briefly reached Category 5 strength on Monday, then weakened to a Category 3. But the U.S. National Hurricane Center warned that it was still likely to bring life-threatening storm surge, wind and rain to parts of western Mexico. The storm battered the Islas Marias, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) off the mainland, Tuesday morning. It was expected to blow ashore in the evening south of Mazatlan, a tourist resort of about 500,000 people with many U.S. and Canadian expatriates. As Willa closed in, the beach in Mazatlan almost disappeared, with waves slamming against the coastal boulevard, black clouds looming overhead. A few surfers took advantage of the high waves even as workers boarded up windows on hotels, shops and homes. Schools were closed and the streets nearly empty. The federal government issued a decree of “extraordinary emergency” for 19 municipalities in Nayarit and Sinaloa states. Officials said 7,000 to 8,000 people were being evacuated from low-lying areas, mostly in Sinaloa state, where small towns sit amid farmland tucked between the sea and lagoons. There was no immediate word on conditions in the Islas Marias, a group of islands that include a nature preserve and a federal prison. Forecasters said Willa would blow ashore somewhere along a 140-mile (220-kilometer) stretch from Mazatlan to San Blas. Bob Swanson, who is from Saskatchewan, Canada, and spends two to six months of the year in his house in the Cerritos neighborhood near the shore in Mazatlan, said he filled up his washing machine with water, filled his home fuel tank and gassed up his car in he needs to head into the mountains for safety. “I come from a country where we have hurricanes and vicious storms, so I’m kind of waiting with bated breath,” he said over the phone while sitting on his porch and smoking a cigarette. Enrique Moreno, mayor of Escuinapa, a municipality of about 60,000 people along Willa’s potential track, said officials were trying to evacuate everybody in the seaside village of Teacapan. He estimated 3,000 were affected but he expected some would try to stay. “The people don’t want to evacuate, but it’s for their security,” he said. On Tuesday morning, Willa was centered about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southwest of the Islas Marias and 130 miles (205 kilometers) southwest of Mazatlan. It was moving at 5 mph (7 kph). Hurricane-force winds extended 35 miles (55 kilometers) from the storm’s core, and tropical storm-force winds were up to 125 miles (205 kilometers) out. The U.S. hurricane center warned that Willa could bring 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of rain — with up to 18 inches (45 centimeters) in some places — to parts of Jalisco, Nayarit and Sinaloa states, with flash flooding and landslides possible in mountainous areas. Farther to the south, the remnants of Tropical Storm Vicente continued to bring heavy rain that caused dangerous flooding in southern and southwestern Mexico. Officials in Oaxaca state said seven adults and five children drowned or were killed in mudslides.","Hurricane Willa will most likely hit Mexico's Pacific coast resort area by Tuesday afternoon, with winds up to 125 mph and high waves.",2018-10-23T16:21:39Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Hurricane Willa Roars Toward Mexican Resort Area as Authorities Declare an ‘Extraordinary Emergency’,http://time.com/5431995/hurricane-willa-mexican-resort-area-authorities-extraordinary-emergency/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/hurricane-willa-noaa.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,mph,1
Andrew J. Hawkins,"Last year, Porsche unveiled the production version of the Mission E — an all-electric four-door that looked like a worthy rival to Tesla’s Model S. But rather than stick with that alluring and mysterious moniker, the Volkswagen-owned performance automaker opted for a new name: the Taycan. The name, which was announced at an event celebrating the automaker’s 70th anniversary, roughly translates to “lively young horse” in German, a reference to the leaping horse at the heart of the company’s crest. Also, it’s apparently pronounced “tie-con,” but it’s probably already doomed to a lifetime of mispronunciations. “lively young horse” in German “Our new electric sports car is strong and dependable; it’s a vehicle that can consistently cover long distances and that epitomizes freedom,” Porsche AG chief Oliver Blume said in a statement.

The car also has a range of just under 300 miles and is compatible with Europe’s growing fast-charging network. Porsche is part of the Volkswagen Group, and like many of its corporate brethren, it was caught up in the massive emissions cheating scandal that broke in 2015. The company even recalled 22,000 of its diesel SUVs this summer for containing the so-called “defeat devices” that were used to skirt emissions tests. And as countries and other automakers increasingly push toward electric vehicles, the pressure is on to take a big foothold in that section of the market. For both Porsche and fans of electric vehicles, the Taycan can’t come soon enough — even if it does sound kind of like a Liam Neeson movie.","Porsche unveiled the production version of the Mission E — an all-electric four-door that looked like a worthy rival to Tesla’s Model S.

Lightning Motorcycles, which is known for its LS-218 superbike, says its Strike electric motorcycle has 150 miles of range on a single charge and can reach a top speed of 150 miles per hour. The motorcycle’s battery can be charged in 35 minutes with a DC fast charger.
Lightning Motorcycles is one of several companies that have announced plans to sell mass market electric motorcycles.
Harley-Davidson, which first showed off a concept electric motorcycle four years ago, plans to sell a production-ready electric bike called LiveWire this coming August. LiveWire is supposed to be the first in what will be a portfolio of electric Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The LiveWire is more than double the cost of what Lightening Motorcycles plans to bring to market.
The battery powered LiveWire will do 0-60 mph in just over 3 seconds, go 110 miles on a charge, and have a base price of $29,799 MSRP.","A teaser image of headlights plus a few details about the upcoming electric Strike motorcycle from Lightening Motorcycles was apparently too much for some to bear.

Andrew J. Hawkins,"The rapid transit tunnel that Elon Musk’s Boring Company is digging beneath Los Angeles will open on December 10th, and free rides will be offered to the public the following night, Musk tweeted on Sunday evening. The two-mile test tunnel underneath SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California, is a proof of concept for an underground public transportation system, which aims to transport passengers and vehicles beneath congested roadways on autonomously driven electric platforms called “skates.” The skates will theoretically transport eight to 16 passengers, or one passenger vehicle, along magnetic rails at speeds of up to 155 mph (250 km/h), Musk tweeted. Pretty close, actually — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 22, 2018 In August, Musk shared a photo of a Tesla Model S in the same Hawthorne tunnel. ( Questions were recently raised about whether the second tunnel proposed by Musk would be wide enough to accommodate the all-electric vehicle.) In June, the company was selected to build a multibillion-dollar rapid transit link between downtown Chicago to O’Hare International Airport, though the project’s sub-$1 billion price tag has raised questions among tunneling experts. In August, the Boring Company said that it would build a second tunnel in LA to ferry Dodger fans between Los Feliz or East Hollywood and the ballpark in about four minutes for about $1. Last year, Musk said he hopes to connect New York City to Washington, DC via an underground hyperloop and has received tactic approval for the project from the Trump administration. Of course, transportation experts question whether tunnels are really an answer to the quandary of traffic congestion and overcapacity, in addition to questioning Musk’s claims that he can dig tunnels faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional boring technology.","The rapid transit tunnel that Elon Musk’s Boring Company is digging beneath Los Angeles will open on December 10th, and free rides will be offered to the public the following night, Musk tweeted on Sunday evening.",2018-10-22T14:30:13Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Elon Musk says the Boring Company’s first tunnel under LA will open December 10th,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18008674/elon-musk-boring-company-first-tunnel-la-date-opening,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fcGbdjYPNPKfoV1DGdKY4xfPQU0=/0x505:1536x1309/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9561081/elon_musk_the_boring_company_tunnel_photo_1.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,mph,1
