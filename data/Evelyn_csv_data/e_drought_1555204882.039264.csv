Matt Simon,"Cape Town is withering. If current projections hold, the South African city of 4 million will run out of water on May 11, known as Day Zero. It’s been three long years of drought—we're talking a once every 1,000 years kind of problem that Cape Town's water infrastructure just wasn't built for. The irony is that a whole sea of water laps at the shores of the coastal city. But if you wanted to drink it, you’d have to build an expensive, energy-intensive desalination facility. Cape Town is indeed rushing to bring such projects online, at least on a temporary basis, and in so doing is exposing a dire reality: Pockets of humanity around the world may have to rely on the sea to survive drought in the very near future. Because it’s likely that climate change is exacerbating this drought. Models show that for certain parts of the world, things are going to get real hot and real dry. The American South, for instance, could see a tripling of 95-degree-plus days per year by 2050. “Cape Town is a warning shot for us,” says Michael Kiparsky, director of the Wheeler Water Institute at UC Berkeley. “What we can see is that it's very possible for water crises—which emerge all the time around the world—to get close to the point of real, massive human disaster.” The key to managing water is diversifying. Think of it like stocks—if you’re all in on Enron and Enron implodes, so does your money. But invest in a range of companies and you can hedge against uncertainty. Same goes for water sources. Dams, however ecologically terrible their impacts, let you save up a stock of water. You may even decide to treat wastewater to boost your supply. And you’ll of course want to convince your populace to save water, even in times of plenty. Cape Town does not have a stellar portfolio. “The diversification of our water sources would have helped a whole lot earlier,” says environmental scientist Kevin Winter of the University of Cape Town. “It's difficult to do that because you need sometimes these triggers to be able to change the budgetary system and be able to think differently about a long-term strategy.” The city is certainly triggered now. (The local government was unable to provide comment before this story published.) And what it’s been able to do in recent months is pretty remarkable, at least from a public education perspective: A city that once consumed 290 million gallons of water a day now uses 160 million gallons. But that’s still a whole lot of water in a region where rain just refuses to fall. So Cape Town is turning to desalination to tackle the shortfall. Specifically, temporary reverse osmosis plants that’ll spin up in the coming months and provide fresh water. Not much of it in the grand scheme of things—4 million gallons a day—but still a start. Desalination is not a new idea. For decades now, researchers have been doggedly exploring the technology, which comes in two flavors. The first you can do at home if you like, just boiling water to collect steam and leave salt behind. The second is reverse osmosis, and involves forcing water through a permeable membrane to filter out the salt. Problem is, boiling water takes a ton of energy, as does pumping water. The technology is improving. Fancy new materials, like membranes just an atom thick, are making reverse osmosis more efficient. (That is, making it easier to push that water through.) “Desalination technology is going to change considerably in the coming years,” says Winter. “I think what the city is currently doing right now is to go slowly with its experiments and it will start to ratchet those up in time.” Which has some scientists crying foul. Late last year, a group of researchers published a paper detailing how desalinated water could theoretically be tainted by sewage piping into the waters off Cape Town. In their samples of sea water they found 15 pharmaceutical and household chemicals, as well as nasty microbes like E. coli. These are not things you’d want to suck into a desalination plant and turn into drinking water without some serious testing and purification if necessary. On top of the potential pollutants coming out of a desalination plant, there’s also the byproduct of brine (lots and lots of salt), which is pumped back out to sea, potentially disrupting ecosystems. That and desalination plants can kill sea critters by hoovering them up. “It doesn't make sense to me to solve one ecological problem by creating a whole lot more,” says the University of Cape Town’s Lesley Green, co-author of the paper, “which is saltier sea water and not managing the discharge of medicinal compounds and persistent organic pollutants.” Desalination may also present unexpected social costs in Cape Town, because not every citizen would benefit from it. “At home I have water, it flows out of the tap,” says the University of Cape Town’s Tom Sanya, an architect who specializes in sustainable design. “But we have a significant number of people in the informal settlements of Cape Town who don't have water flowing in their homes. If the city has up to now failed to supply each individual resident in Cape Town with water, then I can't be convinced that after investing heavily in technologies we’ll have enough money left to invest in distribution.” Still, in Cape Town, the ecological and social costs of desalination may pale in comparison to the consequences of not turning to the sea for help. The energy costs of the technology are still huge, but Israel has proven it can be done on a massive scale: The nation now makes more freshwater than it needs. And as certain parts of the world descend into a new era of heat and dryness, desalination is going to look like a mighty tempting solution. “It kind of depends on how bad you need the water,” says engineer Amy Childress of the University of Southern California. “And that's exactly where South Africa is, and it's where California would have been if we didn't have a rainy last year. It really is pure and simple—how bad you need the water and how unlucky you are with the drought.” Cape Town has been very, very unlucky. But it’s taking steps to diversify its water portfolio, and the rest of the world would be wise to follow. Otherwise it’ll be Enron for the lot of us.",Pockets of humanity may have to rely on desalination to survive drought in the very near future.,2018-02-09T12:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","Facing Water Crisis, Cape Town Turns to Desalination",https://www.wired.com/story/cape-town-sets-out-to-de-salt-the-sea/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a7ca47691799c50c824e6a3/191:100/pass/capetowndrought-913645188.jpg,wired,Wired,drought,1
Mark Kaufman,"Out West, the future is dry.
Amid an unprecedented 19-year drought in the expansive Colorado River Basin which supplies water to 40 million Americans seven Western states have acknowledged that the 21st century will only grow drier as temperatures continue to rise. And that means less water in the 1,450-mile Colorado River. On Tuesday, water managers from states including California, Utah, and New Mexico announced a drought plan (formally called a Drought Contingency Plan), which cuts their water use for the next seven years until an even more austere plan must be adopted.
Already, the drought has left water levels at Lake Mead the nearly 250-square-mile reservoir that's held back by the formidable Hoover Dam at their lowest levels in half a century. The water shortage has left telltale, white mineral ""bathtub rings"" around the basin, well over 100 feet high. 
""This is a long anticipated step that clearly needed to happen,"" Brad Udall, a senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University who had no role in the plan, said in an interview. 
""The bad news is we still have a lot of work left,"" added Udall. ""As the climate continues to change and warm in the Southwest, all science shows that the river is expected to decline in the future.""
""We all recognize were looking at a drier future,"" Tom Buschatzke, Director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources, said in a call with reporters on Tuesday.

The Colorado River and its reservoirs though certainly not yet low enough to imperil millions of Westerners are gradually evaporating while the desert land grows ever drier. The West is still expected to see yearly fluctuations in extreme precipitation, though the region can't escape the consequences of a steadily rising thermostat. ""We'll continue to see odd and unusual climate extremes, both wet and dry,"" said Udall. ""But these warmer temperatures just add an environmental load onto the system in very harmful ways.""
Just how much are the West's rising temperatures and associated heat waves so hot that they have grounded commercial jetliners in Arizona drying out the winding Colorado River basin? A study coauthored by Udall last year found that climate change was responsible for half the Colorado River's flow declines over the last century (with other factors like less rain accounting for the other drops). Though, a 2017 study found this number to be a bit lower, at around one-third. 
Either way, the climate effect is substantial and only expected to grow more potent: Over the last 40 years, Earth has experienced an accelerated warming trend and civilization's heat-trapping carbon emissions probably won't even peak for at least 10 more years. Already, the planet's carbon dioxide levels are likely the highest they've been in 15 million years.  
""It's projected to continue to get warmer,"" said Ursula Rick, Managing Director of the University of Colorado Boulders Western Water Assessment, in reference to the Colorado River Basin.

Accepting the reality of hotter climes, the latest drought plans will manage the total supply of water, so that levels at the two greatest reservoirs, Mead and Powell, don't drop to levels that would trigger automatic water restrictions and a takeover by the federal government. Lake Mead currently sits at around 1,089 feet. If it ever fell to 1,075 feet, water rationing would go into effect. 
""Theyre [drought plans] meant to avoid a crisis on the river,"" Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Brenda Burman said in a Tuesday call with reporters.
One important part of the plan allows upper basin states like Colorado to keep more water in Lake Powell (which generates great amounts of electricity and lowers their utility bills), rather than being required to send this water to the depleted Lake Mead but only as a reward if upper basin states slash their water use. Meanwhile, lower basin states like Arizona and California are expected to cut their water use, too.

Today's water woes are a significant departure from the 1980s and 1990s, fruitful times when Lake Mead even reached its storage capacity. The lake's levels were nearly 140 feet higher back then. 
""We've never seen 19 years like this. It's unprecedented,"" said Udall. ""The old ways of managing water in the West arent working and wont work in the 21st century.""
Although this latest drought contingency plan which must now get approved by Congress averts a near-term crisis, there's still a gaping hole in the scheme. California's thirsty agricultural Imperial Valley which claims rights to a whopping 70 percent of all the Colorado River water the Golden State is afforded each year did not agree to the plan. First, the Imperial Irrigation District wants $200 million in taxpayer dollars to fix the nearby environmental catastrophe that is the vanishing Salton Sea. (It's California's largest and often stinkiest lake, created by accident over a century ago, and is a long, winding water fiasco of its own.) 
But in the future, with water only growing more limited, the powerful water district will almost certainly have to slash its ample share of water consumption. ""They're going to have to contribute,"" said Udall.

The fate of the West over the coming decades, however, won't only be determined by water cuts and humanity's efforts to stymie climate change. It's dependent upon how many people choose to settle in the seemingly-idyllic, sun-blanketed Western world. ""The growth of the region is a big unknown,"" noted the Western Water Assessment's Rick. 
What's more, the ability of water to sustain the region is dependent on how people will want to live, said Rick. ""Will they want yards? Will they want their food to be locally grown?"" she asked. 
In a warmer world, the state and federal government can intervene like they're doing now to avert water crises and maintain societal desires. Though, at some point, water demand may be too great for a burgeoning, thirsty West. ""They can reduce demand but only to a certain point,"" said Rick. 
""The old ways of managing water in the West arent working and wont work in the 21st century.""
Now, states are watching the drought intently. It's evident that water managers see a water-limited future, stoked by climate change. Back in 2003, Udall noted that when he gave talks on future climate impacts to the water management community, he was sometimes given ""dirty looks."" 
But 10 years later, that changed. By 2013, the unprecedented drought caused Colorado River reservoirs to plummet. A truly unsettling drought had set in. And it hasn't gone away.
""Somewhere around 2013 I think the light went on,"" said Udall, describing how many water managers began to accept the scientific realities of long-term drought and climate change. ""The light went on that climate change is here, and now we gotta prepare for it.""","Out West, the future is dry.

LAUREN MARKHAM,"Outside a youth refugee facility in Sicily, a group of teenagers from Gambia who had crossed the Mediterranean from Libya told me that farming had become too difficult to sustain in their country as the semiarid Sahel region spreads ever wider across the continent, drying up people’s land. In Yemen, years of water scarcity helped lead to the country’s brutal conflict. El Salvador, one of the world’s most murderous countries, is just now recovering from a devastating drought, which only heightens the stakes and scope of the violence. In my book about youth migration from El Salvador, “The Far Away Brothers,” I write about a family that ended up on the wrong side of a gang-protected man in town. The family’s teenage twin brothers left because there was a price on their heads, but the challenges persisted for those who remained behind. The family’s fields produced less and less. The tomatoes took on a pallid, sickly color; other crops failed to grow at all. The family couldn’t survive from farming anymore, so more of the children considered going north. They haven’t yet, but nearly every day, one of the daughters tell me, she considers making arrangements to leave. Many things are exacerbating the effects of the drought in Central America, including pervasive deforestation and farmers overtaxing their land. But according to Climatelinks, a project of the United States Agency for International Development, the average temperature in El Salvador has risen 2.34 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1950s, and droughts have become longer and more intense. The sea has risen by three inches since the 1950s, and is projected to rise seven more by 2050. Between 2000 and 2009, 39 hurricanes hit El Salvador, compared with 15 in the 1980s. This, too, is predicted to get worse. When reporting a story among migrants living in the shadows of a Kenyan slum, I asked a group of men why they left their homes in rural Ethiopia. They were farmers there, like many generations before them, but they told me they could no longer make a living off their crops or even adequately feed their families. The rains had changed — it wasn’t just that they had lessened but that they had become more erratic; no rain when the crops needed it to grow, and then, when it was time for harvest, it would rain suddenly and terribly, ruining the crops. The men had left for Kenya to find work and send money back to feed their families. Like El Salvador, Gambia, Bangladesh and Guatemala, Ethiopia has been hit hard by climate change, though it is not even in the top 100 emitters of greenhouse gases. But the problem with climate change, of course, is that it is a problem that crosses borders. The anti-immigrant rhetoric of the Trump administration has made for elaborate and bombastic theater — but with real, and sometimes deadly, human consequences (see again the children separated from their parents at the border). But Mr. Trump means what he says: He wants immigration from poor countries to stop. He sees the problems in those countries as theirs, not ours — never mind the centuries of catastrophic foreign intervention in places like El Salvador and the rest of the Americas, the Arab world and sub-Saharan Africa, or the growing menace of the changing climate. If President Trump really wants to curb “illegal” migration to the United States for the long haul, he’d better get serious about climate change. The Trump administration can continue to eviscerate the E.P.A. and thumb its nose at global efforts to protect the climate. Or he can work responsibly to try to curb international migration by addressing the challenges of a warming planet. He can’t have it both ways.",Gang violence and lack of jobs are reasons people head to the United States.

Laura Mallonee,"If you drove through the Hamoun Wetlands of southeastern Iran centuries ago, you would have found an oasis. In the rainy season, lakes and marshes have drenched its more than 1,500 square miles, sustaining deer, flamingos and even leopards. Humans made a decent life for themselves by tending cattle, catching fish and cultivating the fertile ground. But when Hashem Shakeri drove through this year, he found a desert. A 20-year drought and poor water management have destroyed the wetlandsalong with wildlife, agriculture and whole villages they once sustained in modern Sistan and Baluchestan Province. Shakeri documented this loss for his haunting series An Elegy for the Death of Hamun. Wherever I went, people talked about the drought, he says. They believed that Hamoun had taken life away with itself. The Hamoun Wetlands have always suffered dry spells, but this one is particularly brutal. Trouble began in the early 1950s, when Afghanistan built a dam on the Helmand River, which feeds the wetlands, tamping its flow to Iran. The decline spiraled through the 1990s, when water diversions and a drought that hit in '98 triggered a full-blown water crisis. Animals and crops died. Fisheries closed. And nearly 100 towns were buried in sand whipped up by dustbowl winds. This had dire consequences for Sistan and Baluchestan Province, a 70,000-square-mile region home to 2.8 million people, mostly Sunnis. Many people lack basic access to clean water, food and education, subsisting on government handouts of just $10 per month. With unemployment at nearly 13 percent, some have turned to smuggling fuel and drugs. Humans have become hardened in their battle with the nature, Shakeri says. They are fighting tooth and nail to survive. It's a battle Shakeri has long followed from Tehran, a two-hour flight from Sistan and Baluchestan. He's wanted to document the drought for years but lacked the resources to do so until this year, when the International School of Media and Journalism in Aarhus, Denmark lent him a medium format camera. During two trips in May and October, he drove more than 850 miles through the region, accompanied by fixers who helped him communicate with locals, many of whom speak Baluchi instead of Persian. Shakeri focused on capturing scenes directly related to the droughtwhether dusty riverbeds, abandoned fishing boats or shriveled palms. He exposed his color film several stops over to soften the intense sunlight; it gives the images a washed-out, dreamy feel that captures the sense of disappointment, exhaustion, and stasis he encountered at every turn. ""To me, the poetry and narration of the image are very important,"" he says. ""At the height of bitterness and pain, I like to take beautiful pictures."" Unfortunately, the project is now on pause, since renewed US sanctions against Iran have made it impossible to find the 120 color film Shakeri uses. The sanctions also make life even harder in Sistan and Baluchestan. Though the United Nation Development Program has been working with Iran and Afghanistan on a deal to restore the wetlands, that will take years. In the meantime, relief seems as distant as the oasis that once was.

 Water shortage is a familiar story in Maharashtra
Drought has been declared in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, despite an ambitious government scheme to replenish ground water supplies. So what went wrong? BBC Marathi investigates.
""This year we received rains for only two days. But this is unlikely to last us for the next 15 days. The government will have to provide us water via tankers,"" says Nana Dudhare, the head of Akhatwada village in Khultabad district. 
Khultabad is among 151 administrative blocks in the state where drought was officially declared on 31 October last year.
Water shortage is a familiar story in Maharashtra.
In 2016 severe drought prompted the government to ask local municipalities to stop supplying water to swimming pools - in an unprecedented move, a train carrying half a million litres of drinking water was sent to the area of Latur.
But this year was meant to be different. 
A ground water conservation scheme that cost the government millions of rupees was expected to yield results. The Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyan, as it is known, has been touted as the solution to Maharashtra's water problems. 
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 The search for water can be long and arduous
The scheme aims to take advantage of years with good rainfall - by storing and conserving the rain water it hopes to create perennial sources of water in every village. It specifies nine methods of conservation, including digging farm ponds, deepening small streams and constructing small dams. It has another ambitious goal too: make 5,000 villages free of water scarcity every year.
It has been implemented in 16,522 villages across the state so far, including Akhatwada and the rains were reasonably better last year. Yet, the scheme does not seem to have had much of an impact given that many of these villages are already facing severe water shortage. The situation is only expected to worsen as the hot summer months approach. 
Much of the reason for this appears to be the programme itself.
Villagers in Akhatwada, for instance, complain that they were not consulted about the best methods to conserve water under Jalyukta Shivar.
""The government has its own set methods of doing the work, and we don't have a say. They decided which ponds and streams should be deepened and then abandoned most of them halfway. The machines were pulled out before the work was complete,"" says Somnath Kamte, a farmer who saw a pond dug in his property. 
Image copyrightBBC/NITESH RAUTImage caption
 Villagers complain that work has been only half-completed
He says that even the pond in his own farm is likely to run out of water in the coming days. 
Prof HM Desarda, an agricultural economist based in Maharashtra, has been one of the programme's biggest detractors. He filed a petition in the Bombay High Court in 2015 when the scheme was first announced, calling it ""unscientific"" and alleging that its implementation was faulty.
He says that the programme's method of water conservation is ""conceptually and operationally flawed"" and ""lacks a holistic approach"".
""In their anxiety to show that they have invented something out of the box, the government has gone ahead and implemented a programme with no basic understanding of the science of hydrology or even ecology,"" he told the BBC. 
He says that the proper way to carry out hydrology schemes was to examine the sources of water and adopt ""macro approaches"" to conserving it. By merely going to villages and digging ponds and deepening streams, he argues, you end up damaging fragile eco-systems and not solving the underlying problem. 
The Bombay High Court asked a panel to investigate Prof Desarda's objections, but he contested the findings, which upheld the ""scientific"" approach of the scheme, asking why the committee only visited nine villages when the programme had been implemented in more than 16,000.

In February, the court refused to scrap the programme in what was seen as a major relief for the government. 
The state water resources minister, Vijay Shivtare, says his government stands by the scheme. 
""A water-audit is undertaken before we begin any work in any village. Information like the amount of water needed, how much water is available to the animals, how much water is there for irrigation, the capacity of the storage pond in the village, the level of deficiency - all this information is gathered and submitted to local authorities,"" he told the BBC. 
A state parliamentarian too says that the programme was a ""top class scheme and no-one should criticise it"".
Mr Shivtare adds that it was unfair to call the programme a failure when the real issue was a lack of rain. He says that although there had been higher rainfall last year compared to previous years, it was still not enough for the programme to succeed. 
""The structure of Jalyukta Shivar was created on the assumption that a certain amount of rain will be received on average. If the rains do not come close to that, what do we do? The scheme never promised that water would come from the earth. It is meant to conserve the water falling from the sky,"" he told the BBC.

The BBC's Secunder Kermani reports from Herat. Shadi Mohammed, 70, wells up with tears as he walks through the makeshift camp on the outskirts of the western city of Herat, where he lives with his family. ""We are thirsty and hungry. We took what little we could with us, but lost most of it on the way. Now we have nothing. Eight of us live in this small tent,"" he says. ""My wife and my brother died. Half of our children are here. The other half were left behind."" Mr Mohammed is one of an estimated 260,000 people who have been forced from their homes in northern and western Afghanistan because of a severe drought in the region. The drought is adding to the misery in the country where levels of violence have been increasing since 2014 when international forces formally ended their combat mission. The Taliban are now reported to control more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since the US led invasion which drove them from power in 2001. But the UN says that this year, the drought has displaced more Afghans than even the conflict between the Taliban and the government.

JOHN R. ALLEN and DAVID G. VICTOR,"What makes climate change such a pernicious problem is that it increases the odds of those adverse conditions arising especially in places where government already does not function well. When the stress of climate change multiplies, so will the problems the military must handle.
While its always a good idea to look at uncertainties in any scientific assessment, the White House red-teaming is poised to investigate the wrong questions. The scheme, anchored in the climate-denier community, is designed to generate talking points for a president who is skeptical of climate science and thus will focus on whether climate change is happening at all and whether a little warming is all bad news.
A useful red team would investigate uncertainties in the opposite way, by focusing on the evidence that the climate is changing much more rapidly than originally expected. Getting serious about the odds that global warming could be much more harmful than expected could amplify previous assessments for the nations security.
Uncertainty is endemic to climate science because the exact level of future changes in climate are hard to pin down. The pathways that lead from warming to tangible harm to the nations coastlines, crops, military and overseas interests are highly complex. Some of the best scientific studies on these impacts including last falls assessment by 13 federal agencies have begun to look at how uncertainty and complexity interact in ways that make climate dangers look much scarier. Good intelligence estimates must grapple more fully with this as well, but doing that properly will be a lot harder now that the White House is instructing the rest of the government to avoid serious analysis of climate dangers.

Mark Kaufman,"What's up in earthquake country?
A compelling new report authored by two U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) researchers found that three powerful California faults have been strangely almost impossibly quiet for the last 100 years. Digging into the soil around these faults, Glenn Biasi and Kate Scharer found that big, earth-rupturing earthquakes have been a regular occurrence in the temblor-prone land over the last 1000 years.  
That's what makes the last 100 years so unusual.
""We should not see gaps of 100 years,"" Biasi said.
This study, published in Seismological Research Letters, is valuable to consider, not just for what it says about the region's past, but what it could mean for California's shaky future. Here are the big takeaways.
1. Expect the next century to be...busier 
While scientists cannot predict earthquakes, records of past temblors (preserved by transformation and changes in the ground) give researchers like Biasi a coherent understanding of how faults generally behave. Three of California's most important faults the San Andreas, San Jacinto, and Hayward carry most of the Golden State's load as they separate the massive Pacific plate from the great North American plate. These colossal slabs of Earth's crust are incessantly pushing and sliding against one another. 
At some point, something has to give. 
""The next century has to be busier than the last one.""
In the years between 1800 and 1918, there was a lot of give, with eight big, ground-rupturing quakes preserved in the geologic record. The most famous of these temblors, the infamous 1906 San Francisco quake, dramatically thrust the ground forward some 20 feet.
Now, after years of quietude, the pressure is building along these faults.
""It's reasonable that if theres a long quiescence we would expect a higher rate for the next 100 years,"" said John Vidale, a seismologist and director of the Southern California Earthquake Center.

It's unknown just how many more big quakes (of magnitude 6.5 or higher) might occur this century. But it's unwise to ignore the averages of past quaking activity. There's been three or four per century. So after the recent century of quiet, there may be a bit more action.
""The next century has to be busier than the last one,"" said Biasi. ""Our studies suggest that those probabilities are somewhat higher."" 
2. But we're not on the verge of an earthquake storm
Although it only takes one terrible quake to traumatize a region, the lack of big quakes over the last 100 years doesn't mean there's a looming flurry of violent temblors. 
""Were not on the verge of some earthquake storm in the next couple years,"" said Vidale. When faults have been quiet for some time, the risk for movement on a fault or section of a fault might double, at most, he explained. But it's not as if everything is now ready to blow.

""It's not that [the odds of a quake] skyrocket,"" said Vidale. ""The danger might be doubled but not everything is overdue. It's not 10-months pregnant.""
SEE ALSO: The West accepts its drought-ridden future, slashes water use
A still unknown circumstance hiding beneath the ground may be responsible for quiet along California's weighty faults, noted Biasi. The exceptional odds of such a quiet 100-year-period happening which came out to the extremely low odds of just 0.3 percent according to their models isn't some rare, statistical accident, emphasized Biasi. There may be some geologic events, or organization, transpiring below ground and slowing or suspending California's big faults. ""It's more likely there's some organizing influence at work,"" he said, noting that the busy quake activity in the preceding century may have changed or trigged something, like a freeway accident causing a pileup, but the road ahead is unusually (and temporarily) empty. 
""It may be that the organization [NR: what does he mean by organization?] is due to a flurry of activity from 1800 to 1918,"" Biasi said. 
3. The critical message
It's likely that Californians will see more quakes in the next century. To David Jackson, a California seismologist who has researched earthquake rates, that means that Californians need to remain prepared regardless of projected earthquake rates.
""We always need to be concerned about earthquakes,"" said Jackson.
He has some advice.
""Every time you hear the word 'earthquake' take a step to improve your resiliency,"" Jackson said. ""Do something.""
""Do something.""
Jackson himself, a renowned geologist, admits he still hasn't done all he can do to prepare for a quake. He recommends hopping online to the USGS, Southern California Earthquake Center, or The Great California ShakeOut, and learn how to prepare.
A major quake can rupture the pipes carrying water to your community. Do you have enough water a gallon a day per person to survive? Should you run outside during a quake (NO!)? Do you have a radio should cell towers go down? How do you shut off your leaking gas line? The violent shaking stopped now what do you do?

It's going to happen. ""A nice sharp jolt under the city could wreak havoc,"" said Vidale. 
But this inevitability might be easy to forget, after it's been relatively quiet. 
""People forget how expensive and disruptive an earthquake would be,"" said Vidale. This includes, critically, the government, who maintains or oversees roads, infrastructure, and building standards. ""The implication is were probably a bit complacent. The next 100 years might be a bit more exciting than average.""
4. The earthquake case is still open
This latest study underscores the point that it's been quiet in quake country and that's likely to change. But both Jackson and Vidale emphasize that the past century might not be as quiet as it appears. 
For one, there have been dramatic quakes along lesser faults, like the deadly 1994 Northridge, 1989 Loma Prieta (which stopped a World Series game), and 1971 Sylmar quakes. ""If you look at all the quakes that have happened, there's not a hiatus, said Vidale. The USGS's Biasi certainly isn't saying there's been a total quake drought just a drought of big quakes along the major faults. 
But Jackson, who five years ago posed a question about California's temblor hiatus in the talk ""Did Someone Forget to Pay the Earthquake Bill?,"" is skeptical that all the past quakes identified in this study by observing notable displacements in the ground were actually caused by earthquakes. His implication is if there were less quakes in past, perhaps the recent dearth of quakes wouldn't be so exceptional.

Until around 1900, humanity didn't have a means of scientifically measuring earthquakes, so our quake record is based upon observing clues of movement in the ground, a science called paleoseismology. Many of these fissures and breaks in the earth are almost certainly evidence of quakes. But other ground alterations might have come from other natural events, said Jackson. (These include things like major debris flows and erosion.)  
""Theyre pretty confident that every one of those displacements they see are the result of an earthquake,"" said Jackson. ""I dont quite accept that."" (Though, it should be noted that Biasi and Scharer addressed this in their paper: The deformation of the land around faults is often different than land alterations elsewhere.)
""It sheared my grandfather's house off the ground.""
But the past earthquake rates, said Jackson, still aren't the critical point. 
""Whether or not the story is true isn't as important as a reminder that earthquakes are happening,"" he said. 
Indeed, they are even if it's been temporarily calm along the big geologic players. But they'll hit again. Sometimes at 6:01 a.m., when you're tucked in bed, in calm, idyllic, California.  
The early morning 1971 Sylmar quake hit Biasi hard. ""It dumped all the dishes out of our house. It sheared my grandfather's house off the ground,"" he said. 
""That was my gentle introduction to earthquakes.""",What's up in earthquake country?

TYLER KEPNER,"The Orioles were by far the majors worst team last season, at 47-115, and the Yankees won 12 of their 19 meetings. That was good, but not great; the Red Sox pummeled the Orioles, going 16-3 against them. Even the Toronto Blue Jays (14-5) did better against Baltimore than the Yankees did.
Asked about the importance of games against weak teams and the American League could have several Judge was careful to praise the Orioles. But he added a telling revelation.
Thats our big thing, and I think last year a lot of times on teams that were below .500, we didnt do too well, he said. So thats been a priority of ours in spring training going into now: Just go out there and try to dominate every single pitch, every single team.
That was a secret to the best team in recent major league history, the 1998 Yankees: They never took a game off. That season, they went 21-1 against the overmatched Devil Rays and Royals, and 8-1 against the Expos, Marlins and Phillies, their worst interleague rivals.
So as the long schedule unfolds, keep track of not just the showcase games against the Red Sox, the Houston Astros, and those high-flying hopefuls from Queens, the unbeaten, unscored-on Mets.

Mark Kaufman,"Coastal cities like New York and San Francisco have already started legal battles with oil giants for knowingly fueling climate change. Now, landlocked communities in Colorado have filed their own suit against the oil companies Exxon Mobil and Suncor, both of which extract large amounts of oil and gas from the Colorado ground. The lawsuit, filed by Boulder County, San Miguel County, and the City of Boulder, seeks compensation from oil companies ""for the substantial role they played and continue to play in causing, contributing to and exacerbating climate change."" These climate alterations, they argue, have brought increased heatwaves, droughts, and fire to the region. They believe Exxon and Suncor should pay for the damages. Previously, lawsuits from coastal cities focused on sea level rise, not the other extreme manifestations of global warming. This is the first such climate lawsuit from an inland state, according to the local agencies which filed the complaint. SEE ALSO: In court, oil company admits reality of human-caused global warming, denies guilt ""A few pebbles are turning into a landslide,"" Kassie Siegel, director of the Climate Law Institute, a legal campaign to protect environments from climate change, said in an interview. ""It shows the tide is turning against fossil fuel producers,"" she said. ""This is about fairness. It's completely unfair that taxpayers are being asked to pay for the costs of the damages done by oil companies."" The Colorado counties contend that oil companies have known about the long-term effects of greenhouse gas emissions for 50 years. They cite a report that Stanford Research Institute scientists presented to the American Petroleum Institute in 1968. The report warned that carbon dioxide emissions would warm the planet, melt ice caps, and ""may be the cause of serious world-wide environmental challenges."" The report will likely serve as important evidence in the case, should the trial proceed and not be settled out of court or be derailed by a number of legal circumstances. ""I would expect that report and others like it would be key evidence in this case,"" said Siegel. A 2011 drought in Colorado destroyed a winter wheat harvest. Image: Denver Post via Getty Images The suit also cites the 2017 National Climate Assessment, in which 13 federal departments and agencies found that high-temperature events and forest fires, among many other adverse effects, are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. U.S. government scientists stated bluntly: ""This period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization."" Some Colorado communities, who know these climatic shifts will adversely affect their business and agricultural sectors, are now working to decrease their dependency on fossil fuels. By 2030, the City of Boulder plans to generate all of its electricity from renewable energies, like solar. ""Communities in Colorado and across the country are already doing what they can to curb their carbon emissions and are spending millions of dollars to adapt to a wide array of harms caused by global warming,"" Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement. ""Those costs will only multiply over the next few decades, and taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to foot the bill that the fossil fuel industry has knowingly run up over the last 40 years."" The Union of Concerned Scientists is a nonprofit science advocacy organization that often speaks out against climate change deniers. In the western United States, one obvious consequence of increased drought and heat are wildfires. Today's wildfires burn nearly year-round and burn significantly more land than wildfires did in the '70s, '80s, and '90s, posing an outsized harm to the forested state, which is consistently battling drought and low snow pack — similar to California. Both Exxon and Suncor sell oil in Colorado. Suncor has an especially prominent presence, as the company runs its operations out of Denver, a city currently facing drought. Suncor sends over 200 truckloads of Colorado crude oil to its refineries each day. Last month, some of the nation's largest oil companies presented their understanding of climate science to a federal judge in San Francisco, in which they admitted humans were contributing to climate change, but side-stepped responsibility. These proceedings move incrementally, so it's not yet known if that hearing will advance to the next step, and then, potentially a trial. But oil companies are now being hit with lawsuits from local governments on both coasts and the interior of the U.S. ""This shows you the list of governments that are being affected and that can take action is almost limitless,"" said Siegel. ""The question is who will be next.""","Coastal cities like New York and San Francisco have already started legal battles with oil giants for knowingly fueling climate change.

It coughs and wheezes like it’s gone asthmatic. It gurgles like someone drowning. It spits once, and then goes silent. Our dog, Kingston, raises his ears, but still keeps his distance from the sink, unsure if it might unexpectedly come back to life, but no such luck. Mom just stands there holding Kingston’s water bowl beneath the faucet, puzzling. Then she moves the handle to the off position, and says, “Alyssa, go get your father.” Ever since single-handedly remodeling our kitchen, Dad has had delusions of plumbing grandeur. Electrical, too. “Why pay through the nose for contractors when you can do it yourself?” he always said. Then he put his money where his mouth was. Ever since, we’ve had nothing but plumbing and electrical problems. Dad’s in our garage working on his car with Uncle Basil—who’s been living with us on and off since his almond farm up in Modesto failed. Uncle Basil’s actual name is Herb, but somewhere along the line my brother and I began referring to him as various herbs in our garden. Uncle Dill, Uncle Thyme, Uncle Chive, and during a period our parents wish we would forget, Uncle Cannabis. In the end, Basil was the name that stuck. “Dad,” I shout out into the garage, “kitchen issues.” My father’s feet stick out from underneath his Camry like the Wicked Witch. Uncle Basil is hidden behind a storm cell of e-cig vapor. “Can’t it wait?” my father says from beneath the car. But I’m already sensing that it can’t. “I think it’s major,” I tell him. He slides out, and with a heavy sigh heads for the kitchen. Mom’s not there anymore. Instead she’s standing in the doorway between the kitchen and the living room. She’s just standing there, the dog’s empty water bowl still in her left hand. I get a chill, but I don’t yet know why. “What’s so important that you gotta drag me out of—” “—Shush!” Mom says. She rarely shushes Dad. She’ll shush me and Garrett all day, but my parents never shush each other. It’s an unspoken rule. She’s watching the TV, where a news anchor is blathering about the “flow crisis.” That’s what the media’s been calling the drought, ever since people got tired of hearing the word “drought.” Kind of like the way “global warming” became “climate change,” and “war” became “conflict.” But now they’ve got a new catchphrase. A new stage in our water woes. They’re calling this the “Tap-Out.” Uncle Basil emerges from his vapor cloud long enough to ask, “What’s going on?” “Arizona and Nevada just backed out of the reservoir relief deal,” Mom tells him. “They’ve shut the floodgates on all the dams, saying they need the water themselves.” Which means that the Colorado River won’t even reach California anymore. Uncle Basil tries to wrap his mind around it. “Turning off the entire river like it’s a spigot! Can they do that?” My father raises an eyebrow. “They just did.” Suddenly the image switches to a live press conference, where the governor addresses a gathering of antsy reporters. “This is unfortunate, but not entirely unexpected,” the governor says. “We have people working around the clock attempting to broker a new deal with various agencies.” “What does that even mean?” Uncle Basil says. Both Mom and I shush him. “As a precautionary measure, all county and municipal water districts in Southern California are temporarily rerouting all resources to critical services. But I cannot stress enough the need to keep calm. I’d like to personally assure everyone that this is a temporary situation, and that there is nothing to be concerned about.” The media begins to bombard him with questions, but he ducks out without answering a single one. “Looks like Kingston’s water bowl isn’t the only one that’s run dry,” Uncle Basil says. “I guess we’re gonna have to start drinking out of the toilet, too.” My younger brother, Garrett, who’s been sitting on the couch waiting for normal TV to return, makes the appropriate face, which just makes Uncle Basil laugh. “So,” Dad says to Mom, halfheartedly, “at least the plumbing problem isn’t my fault this time.” I go to the kitchen to try the tap myself—as if I might have the magic touch. Nothing. Not even the slightest dribble. Our faucet has coded, and no amount of resuscitation will bring it back. I note the time, like they do in the emergency room: 1:32 p.m., June 4th. Everyone’s going to remember where they were when the taps went dry, I think. Like when a president is assassinated. In the kitchen behind me, Garrett opens the fridge and grabs a bottle of Glacier Freeze Gatorade. He begins to guzzle it, but I stop him on the third gulp. “Put it back,” I tell him. “Save some for later.” “But I’m thirsty now,” he whines, protesting. He’s ten—six years younger than me. Ten-year-olds have issues with delayed gratification. It’s almost finished anyway, so I let him keep it. I take note of what’s in the fridge. A couple of beers. Three more eight-ounce bottles of Gatorade, a gallon of milk that’s down to the dregs, and leftovers. You know how sometimes you don’t realize how thirsty you are until you take that first sip? Well, suddenly I get that feeling just by looking in the refrigerator. It’s the closest thing I’ve ever had to a premonition. I can hear neighbors out in the street now. We know our neighbors—run into them occasionally. The only time whole bunches of them come out into the street at the same time is July Fourth, or when there’s an earthquake. My parents, Garrett, and I gravitate outside as well, all of us standing, strangely, looking to one another for some kind of guidance, or at least validation that this is actually happening. Jeannette and Stu Leeson from across the street, the Maleckis and their newborn, and Mr. Burnside, who’s been eternally seventy years old for as long as I can remember. And as expected, we don’t see the reclusive family next door—the McCrackens—who have probably barricaded themselves inside their suburban fortress upon hearing the news. We all kind of stand there with our hands in our pockets, avoiding direct eye contact, like my classmates at the junior prom. “Okay,” my dad finally says, “which one of you pissed off Arizona and Nevada?” Everyone chuckles. Not because it’s particularly funny, but it eases some of the tension. Mr. Burnside raises his eyebrows. “Hate to say I told ya so, but didn’t I say they’d hoard what’s left of the Colorado River?” He shakes his head. “We let that river become our only lifeline. We should never have let ourselves become so vulnerable.” Used to be no one much knew or cared where our water came from. It was just always there. But when the Central Valley started to dry up and the price of produce skyrocketed, people started to pay attention. Or at least enough attention to pass laws and voter propositions. Most of them were useless, but made people feel as if something was being done. Like the Frivolous Use Initiative, that made things like throwing water balloons illegal. “Las Vegas still has water,” someone points out. Our neighbor, Stu, shakes his head. “Yeah—but I just tried to book a hotel in Vegas. A million hotel rooms, and not a single one available.” Mr. Burnside laughs ruefully, as if taking pleasure in Stu’s misfortune. “One hundred twenty-four thousand hotels rooms, actually. Sounds like a whole lot of people had the same idea.” “Ha! Can you imagine the traffic on the fifteen trying to get there?” says my mom, in a sour grapes kind of way. “I wouldn’t want to be caught in that!” And then I put my two cents in. “If they’re diverting the remaining water to ‘critical services,’ it means there’s still a little bit left. Someone should sue to get them to release a fraction of it. Make it like rolling blackouts. Each neighborhood gets a little bit of water each day.” My parents are impressed by the suggestion. The others look at me with an isn’t-she-adorable kind of expression, which ticks me off. My parents are convinced I’m going to be a lawyer someday. It’s possible, but I suspect if I am, it will just be a means to an end—although I’m not sure what that end would be. But that doesn’t help us now—and although I think my idea is a good one, I suspect there’s too much self-interest among the Powers That Be for it to ever happen. And who knows, maybe there isn’t enough water left to share. A phone chimes, receiving a text. Jeannette looks at her Android. “Great! Now my relatives in Ohio found out. Like I need their stress on top of my own.” “Text her back: ‘send water.’” My father quips. “We’ll get through this,” my mom says reassuringly. She’s a clinical psychologist, so reassurance is second nature to her. Garrett, who’s been standing quietly, brings his Gatorade bottle up to his lips... and for a brief moment everyone stops talking. Involuntary. Almost like a mental hiccup, as they watch my brother gulp the quenching blue liquid. Finally, Mr. Burnside breaks the silence. “We’ll talk,” he says as he turns to leave. It’s the way he always ends a conversation. It signals the conclusion of this loose little fellowship. Everyone says their goodbyes and heads back to their homes... but more than one set of eyes glance at Garrett’s empty Gatorade bottle as they leave. “Costco run!” says Uncle Basil late that afternoon, at around five. “Who’s coming?” “Can I get a hot dog?” Garrett asks, knowing that even if Uncle Basil says no, he’ll get one anyway. Uncle Basil is a pushover. “Hot dogs are the least of our problems,” I tell him. And he doesn’t question that. He knows why we’re going—he’s not stupid. Even so, he still knows he’ll get a hot dog. We climb into the cab of Uncle Basil’s four-by-four pickup, which is jacked up higher than should be allowed for any man his age. “Mom said we have a few water bottles in the garage,” Garrett says. “We’re going to need more than just a few,” I point out. I try to quickly do the math in my head. I also saw those bottles. Nine half-liters. Five of us. That won’t even last the day. As we turn the corner out of our neighborhood and onto the main street, Uncle Basil says, “It may take a day or so for the county to get the water up and running again. We’ll probably only need a couple of cases.” “And Gatorade!” says Garrett. “Don’t forget the Gatorade! It’s full of electrolytes.” Which is what they say on the commercials, even though Garrett doesn’t know what an electrolyte is. “Look on the bright side,” Uncle Basil says. “You probably won’t have school for a few days.” The California version of a snow day. I’ve been counting down the days for junior year to end. Just two weeks now. But knowing my high school, they’ll probably find a way to tack any lost days on at the end, delaying our summer vacation. As we pull into the Costco parking lot we can see the crowd. It seems like our entire neighborhood had the same idea. We do nothing but slowly circle in search of an empty space. Finally Uncle Basil pulls out his Costco card and hands it to me. “You two go in. I’ll meet you inside when I find a place to park.” I wonder how he’ll get in without his card, but then, Uncle Basil finds ways around any situation. Garrett and I hop out and join the hordes of people flooding the entrance. Inside it’s like Black Friday at its worst—but today it’s not televisions and video games people are after. The carts in the checkout line are stocked with canned goods, toiletries, but mostly water. The essentials of life. Something feels slightly off. I’m not sure what it is, but it hangs in the air like a scent. It’s in the impatience of the people in line. The way people use their carts—on the verge of being battering rams to make their way through the crowd. There’s a sort of primal hostility all around us, hidden by a veneer of suburban politeness. But even that politeness is stretching thin. “This cart sucks,” Garrett says. He’s right. One wheel is bent, and the only way to push it is to lean it on the other three wheels. I look back toward the entrance. There were only a couple of carts left when I grabbed this one. They’ll all be gone now. “It’ll do,” I tell him. Garrett and I forge our way through the crowds toward the back left corner, where the water pallets are. As we do, we overhear bits and pieces of conversations. “FEMA’s already slammed with Hurricane Noah,” one woman tells another. “How are they going to help us, too?” “It’s not our fault! Agriculture uses eighty percent of the water!” “If the county spent more time finding new sources of water, instead of fining us for filling our swimming pools,” one woman says, “we wouldn’t be in this position.” Garrett turns to me. “My friend Jason has a giant aquarium in his living room, and he didn’t get fined.” “That’s different,” I explain to him. “Fish are considered pets.” “But it’s still water.” “Then go drink it,” I say, shutting him up. I don’t have time to think about other people’s problems. We have our own to worry about. But it looks like I’m the only one who cares, because Garrett has already gone off to hunt for free samples. As I push the cart, it keeps veering to the left and I have to lean heavily on the right side to prevent the bent wheel from acting like a rudder. As I approach the rear of the warehouse, I can see that it’s the most crowded spot, and as I reach the last aisle to see the water pallets, I realize I’m too late. The pallets are already empty. In hindsight, we should have come straight here the moment the taps were turned off. But when something drastic happens, there’s a lag time. It’s not quite denial, and not quite shock, but more like a mental free fall. You’re spending so much time wrapping your mind around the problem, you don’t realize what you need to do until the window to do it has closed. I think of all those people in Savannah the moment Hurricane Noah made that unexpected turn and barreled straight toward them, instead of heading back out to sea like it was supposed to. How long did they stare unblinking at the news, until they packed up their things and evacuated? I can tell you how long. Three and a half hours. Behind me, people who can’t see that the water pallets are empty keep pushing forward. Eventually some employee will have the good sense to put a sign out front that says no water, but until they do, customers will keep piling in, pushing toward the back, creating a suffocating crowd, like the mosh pit of a concert. On a hunch, I maneuver my way to the side aisle, and to the racks of canned soda, which are also beginning to disappear. But I’m not here for soda. As I look around the stacks of drinks, I find a single case of water that someone abandoned there maybe yesterday, when it wasn’t such a precious commodity. I reach for it, only to find it pulled away at the last second by a thin woman with a beak of a nose. She stacks it on top of her cart like a crown on top of her canned goods. “I’m sorry, but we were here first,” she says. And then her daughter steps forward—a girl I recognize her from soccer—Hali Hartling. She’s annoyingly popular and thinks she’s much better at soccer than she really is. Half the girls in school want to be like her, and the other half hate her because they know they’ll never come close. Me, I just put up with her. She’s not worth the energy for me to be anything but indifferent. Although she always seems to bleed confidence, right now she can’t even look me in the eye—because she knows, just as her mother knows, that I had that water first. As her mother pulls their cart away, Hali leans closer to me. “I’m sorry about that, Morrow,” she says, earnestly, calling me by my last name like we do in soccer. Though by the looks of it, right now we’re playing for totally different teams. “Didn’t I share my water with you at practice last week?” I point out to her. “Maybe you could return the favor and share a few bottles with me.” She looks back to her mother, who’s already moving down the aisle, then back to me with a shrug. “Sorry, they don’t sell them by the bottle here. Just by the case.” And then she gets a little bit red in the face, and turns to leave before it becomes a full-fledged flush. I take in my surroundings. Crowds are still getting thicker, and things are vanishing from the shelves at an alarming rate. Even the sodas are gone now. Stupid! I should have grabbed some. I hurry back to my empty cart before someone else can take it. There’s no sign of Uncle Basil yet, and Garrett is probably off stuffing his face with something greasy. The Gatorade he requested is all gone, too. Finally I spot Garrett. He’s down one of the frozen aisles, pizza sauce all over his face. He wipes his mouth with his shirt, knowing I’ll comment. But I don’t bother—because I see something. Just past the frozen vegetables and ice cream, there’s a chest packed with ice. Enormous bags of it. I can’t believe people are such limited thinkers that they haven’t thought of this themselves! Or maybe they have, but denied that they could possibly be so desperate. I open the door and grab a bag of ice, and then another. “What are you doing? We need water, not ice.” “Ice is water, Einstein,” I tell him. I go for a bag, and realize they’re a lot heavier than I had anticipated. “Help me!” Together Garrett and I heave one bag of ice after another into our cart, until it’s piled as high as it can get. By now other people have taken notice, and have crowded the ice case, beginning to empty it. The cart is ridiculously heavy now, and almost impossible to push—especially with a bad wheel. Then, as we struggle with the cart, the jammed wheel scraping across the concrete floor, a man in a business suit comes up behind us. He smiles. “That’s quite a load there,” he says. “Looks like you could use some help.” He doesn’t wait for us to answer before grabbing the cart’s handle, and wrestling it forward far more effectively than we did. “Crazy here today,” he says, jovially. “Crazy everywhere, I’ll bet.” “Thank you for helping us,” I tell him. “Not a problem. We all need to help one another.” He smiles again, and I return the grin. It’s good to know that difficult times can bring out the best in people. Bit by bit, with short but steady lurches, we get the cart to the front of the store, and in one of the snaking checkout lines. “I suppose that’s my workout for the day,” he chuckles. I look at our cart, and decide that one good turn deserves another. “Why don’t you take a bag of ice for yourself,” I suggest. His smile doesn’t fade. “I have an even better idea,” he says. “Why don’t you take a bag of ice for yourselves, and I’ll keep the rest.” For a moment I think he’s joking, but then realize he’s dead serious. “Excuse me?” He manufactures a heavy sigh. “You’re right, that really wouldn’t be fair to you. Tell you what, why don’t we split it down the middle? I’ll take half, you take half.” He says it like he’s being generous. As if the ice is his to give. He’s still smiling, but his eyes scare me. “I think my offer is more than fair,” he says. I begin to wonder what business he’s in, and if it’s all about cheating people but making them think they’re not being cheated. It’s not going to fly with me—but his hands are firmly locked on the handle of our cart, and there’s nothing to prove that it’s ours and not his. “Is there a problem here?” It’s Uncle Basil. He’s arrived just in time. He glares at the man coldly for a moment, then the man takes his hands off the cart. “Not at all,” he says. “Good.” Uncle Basil says. “I’d hate to think you were harassing my niece and nephew. People get arrested for that.” The man holds eye contact with our uncle for a moment more before folding. He looks at the ice, his expression bitter, then leaves, not taking as much as a single bag. Uncle Basil’s pickup truck is parked illegally—halfway onto an island, having demolished a row of ficus. “Had to kick this sucker into four-wheel drive,” he says proudly—probably the first time he’s ever actually had to use it. Suddenly Uncle Basil’s midlife crisis truck is a blessing rather than an embarrassment. We load the bags of ice into the truck bed. “How about that hot dog?” Uncle Basil offers, trying to lighten the mood. “I’m full,” Garrett responds, even though I know that’s a nearly impossible feat for him. He just doesn’t want to go back inside. None of us do. And now there’s a small crowd that’s formed, watching us load the ice into the bed of the truck. Even though I try to ignore it, I know there’s a dozen eyes on us. “Why don’t I ride in the back of the truck bed with the ice?” I suggest. “No, it’s okay,” Uncle Basil replies calmly. “Ride in the cab. Some nasty potholes on the way back. Wouldn’t want you to bounce around back there.” “Right,” I agree as I hop into the cab of the pickup. And although no one speaks of it, I know it’s not potholes my uncle’s worried about. We pull onto our street, but for some reason it doesn’t quite feel like the same block I grew up on. There’s this strangeness, like when you accidentally turn one street too early, and, because all of the cookie-cutter houses look the same, you feel as if you’re in a parallel universe. I try to shake the feeling as I watch the houses go by through the car window. Our neighbors across the street, the Kiblers, usually lounge in their lawn chairs and “supervise” their kids as they play, which in reality means gossiping over glasses of chardonnay while making sure their children don’t get run over. However, today the Kibler kids play tag in the street without supervision. And even through the children’s laughter there’s this overwhelming silence that undertones everything; then again, maybe the silence was always there, and I’m only just noticing it now. Uncle Basil backs the truck into the driveway and we get straight to unloading. Even with the sun getting low in the sky, it’s still ninety degrees, and the ice is already melting. If we’re going to get all of this ice inside in time, we’re going to need to hurry. “Why don’t you go clean out the freezer so we can put some ice in it,” Uncle Basil says as he grabs the first bag from the truck bed. “The rest we can let melt and drink today.” “Better yet, why don’t you clean the downstairs bathtub,” I tell Garret. “We’ll let it melt there.” “Good idea,” says Basil, although Garrett’s not too keen on cleaning the tub. Dad emerges from the garage, greasy wrench in hand, clearly still trying to squeeze water from the pipes. “No Gatorade?” “They ran out,” I tell him, keeping it brief. Dad scratches his head. “Should have gone to Sam’s Club,” he says. “They keep more items stocked in the back of the store.” Although Dad smiles it off, I can tell he’s a little more disturbed than he lets on. I think he knows that Sam’s Club has most likely been cleaned out of all of its bottled liquids, just like every other store. Uncle Basil quickly changes the subject. “Thought you were going into the office today,” he says. Dad shrugs and grabs a bag of ice. “Best thing about having your own business is that you don’t have to work Saturdays if you don’t want to.” Except that Dad does work Saturdays. Some Sundays, too. A lot of people put in extra hours these days, considering how the price of produce has been rising—but even without that, Dad always told us that it takes a 24/7 commitment to build out a business. Yet apparently he’d rather haul ice than sell insurance today. I pull more ice from the back of the truck, but find, even in a thick plastic bag, it’s hard to grip now that it’s starting to melt. “Need some help?” says a voice from behind, and before turning around I know exactly who it is. Kelton McCracken. Your not-so-typical red-headed geek next door. Most kids of his strangeness are content killing zombies with an Xbox controller, but not Kelton. He prefers to spend his time practicing aerial reconnaissance with his drone, shooting critters with his paintball gun, and hiding in his tree house with a pair of night vision goggles, pretending to be Jason Bourne. It’s like he never matured past sixth grade, so his parents just bought him bigger and bigger toys. But today I can’t help but notice that there’s something different about him. Sure, he’s grown in this past year and looks a lot more mature—but it isn’t just that. It’s the way he holds himself. There’s a bounce in his step, as if this whole water crisis excites him in some sick way. Kelton smiles, revealing that his braces are off and his teeth have been wrangled artificially straight. “Sure Kelton, we could use some help,” says Dad. “Why don’t you give Alyssa a hand?” I go to hand him the ice, but as I hold it out to him, something comes over me, and I can’t seem to let go of the bag. Dad takes notice, confused by my hesitation. “Let him take the ice, Alyssa,” he says. I look down to the ice in my hands and then back to Kelton, realizing I’m still skeptical about allowing people to “help.” “Is there a problem?” Dad asks, in an intrusive, fatherly tone that demands an answer—which I don’t give. I force myself to hand the ice over to Kelton. “Just don’t expect a bag for helping,” I tell him, which makes my father give me a stern look, probably wondering what would possess me to be so nasty about it. Maybe later I’ll tell him about that guy at Costco. Or maybe I’ll just try to forget it ever happened. As for Kelton, I expect him to have a snotty comeback, but instead he just stands there, genuinely thrown by my comment. I regain my composure and force a smile, hoping it doesn’t look forced. “Sorry,” I tell him. “Thanks for helping.” We go inside to set the ice in the bathtub, but Kelton grabs my shoulder to stop me. “Have you sealed the drain?” he asks. “Not a good idea putting this ice in the tub unless you’ve sealed the drain. Even the tiniest leak and you’ll lose it all in a few hours.” “I thought my uncle had done that,” I tell him, even though none of us would have thought of it. As much as I hate to admit it, that’s probably the smartest idea I’ve heard all day. “I’ll go get you some caulking,” he says, and hurries off to retrieve the sealant from his garage, obviously happy for an opportunity to put his Boy Scout training into action. Kelton and his reclusive family always seem to have a worst-case scenario plan for anything. Dad would sometimes joke that Mr. McCracken lived a double life, working as a dentist by day and preparing for the end of the world by night. But recently the joke is becoming all the more real. It seems Mr. McCracken now spends most of his time welding cast-iron contraptions late into the night, as if he were drilling into the cavity of the gaping monstrosity that is his garage. Over the past few months Kelton’s family has assembled an over-the-top surveillance system, set up a mini greenhouse in their side yard, and lined their entire roof with some kind of unregistered, off-grid solar panels. Most recently, Kelton—who’s in far too many of my classes this year—is always bragging about how his father installed one-way bulletproof windows—bullets can shoot out from inside, but can’t penetrate from the outside. Even though the rest of our class thinks he’s completely full of it, I think it might be true. I wouldn’t put it past his father to do something like that. Aside from our complaints about the late-night welding, our families are generally amicable, but there’s always been a sense of polite tension when my parents deal with them. We once shared an area of grass between our two houses, until Mr. McCracken installed a picket fence right through my mom’s prize-winning vermilliades. The fence was obnoxiously taller than your typical whitewashed suburban barrier, but just low enough not to technically violate the rules and regulations of the Homeowners Association—which they always seem to be at war with. Once, they even tried to lay claim to the curb in front of their house as their own private parking spot, claiming that their property line extended a few inches into the street—but the association won that battle. Ever since then, Uncle Basil makes a point to park his truck right in front of their house whenever he can, just to mess with them. Kelton returns in a few minutes with the caulking and gets right to sealing the drain. “This might take a couple of hours to harden, so be careful when you pack the ice in,” he says, way more enthusiastic than someone ought to be about silicone sealant. There’s an uncomfortable silence between us that makes me realize that I’ve never actually spent time with Kelton one-on-one. Then something occurs to me that’s not just a conversation filler, but something important. “Wait a second. Don’t you guys have a big water tank behind your house?” “Thirty-five gallons,” Kelton brags, as he applies the caulking with the precision of a jeweler. “But that’s inside our house. The outside one’s for bodily waste, full of quaternary ammonium compound chemicals. You know, like that stinky blue soup at the bottom of a porta potty.” “Yeah, I get it, Kelton,” I say, duly disgusted—but more so by the fact that I haven’t begun to think about our toilets yet. “Well, I can’t say you guys didn’t think ahead,” I say, knowing that’s the understatement of the century. “Well, as my dad always says, ‘We’d rather be wrong than dead wrong.’” Then he adds, “I bet if your dad just thought ahead too, you’d probably be better off.” Kelton’s clearly not aware how insulting he can sound sometimes. I wonder if he ever won a merit badge for being Most Annoying. Kelton finishes up the job. I thank him, and he heads back home to shoot his potato launcher, or dissect bugs, or whatever a kid like him does with his free time. In the kitchen, my mom is scouring every surface with 409. Stress cleaning. When something’s out of your control, you bring order to the things you can. I get that. She’s never been the type, though, to leave the TV on as background noise—but she has it blasting in the family room. I’m not sure where my dad and uncle are. Maybe back working on his car. I find it odd that I feel I need to know. On TV, CNN is focused on the continuing crisis of Hurricane Noah. I don’t begrudge those poor people the attention, but wish some of it would turn toward us, too. “Any news about the Tap-Out?” I ask. “One of the local stations has regular updates,” Mom tells me, “but it’s that brainless anchor I can’t stand. And besides, there’s nothing new.” Even so, I switch to the brainless anchor, who my dad says got his start in porn, although I don’t want to ask him how he knows. My mom’s right; they’re just showing the governor’s statement from this morning, and trying without success to spin it. I switch back to the national news stations. CNN, then MSNBC, then Fox News, and back to CNN again. Every national broadcast is reporting on Noah, and only on Noah. Slowly it dawns on me why. There’s no radar image for a water crisis. No storm surges, no debris fields—the Tap-Out is as silent as cancer. There’s nothing to see, and so the news is treating it like a sidebar. I mention this to my mom. She stops cleaning for a moment, and watches the scrawl of secondary stories at the bottom of the screen. Finally something comes up: California water crisis deepens. Residents urged to conserve. And that’s it. That’s all the national news says. “Conserve? Are you kidding me?” My mom takes a deep breath and sprays the kitchen table again. “As long as FEMA does its job, who care’s what the news says?” “I care,” I tell her. Because if there’s one thing I know about the news, it’s that it decides for most people—including the federal government—what is and what isn’t important. But the big news stations won’t give the Tap-Out the critical airtime it needs—not until there are images that are as dramatic as winds taking off roofs. And if it takes that long for the Tap-Out to be taken seriously, it will be too late. Dry is out Oct. 2, 2018 by Simon &amp; Schuster Children's Publishing.","Neal Shusterman is back!

[ Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter. ] One of the authors, Dabo Guan, of Tsinghua University in Beijing and the University of East Anglia, Norwich, said the report was directed at the richer countries of the world, like the United States, to suggest that climate change will hit everyone, not just the poor, who could suffer dire food shortages.

MARC STEIN,"Lee saw a lot in his first five N.B.A. seasons and, after unexpectedly announcing his retirement on Nov. 19, he spoke with great fondness about much of that time. He is understandably proud of his rise from the 30th overall draft pick in 2005 to the Knicks’ captaincy and of eventually halting the Knicks’ eight-season drought without an All-Star. D’Antoni nudged Lee to a new level when he seized on the young forward’s passing ability, making him an efficient double-double specialist who could also operate from the elbow as a decision-maker. Lee’s experience as an observant rookie helped greatly when it was time to decide to play on or to walk away at age 34. On his first Knicks team, as part of the impossible-to-please Larry Brown’s disastrously brief coaching spell in the Gotham hot seat, Lee was surrounded by big-name veterans either in decline or barely hanging onto their N.B.A. existence. To name just a few: Stephon Marbury, Penny Hardaway and Steve Francis. “I kind of told myself then that I wanted to go out on my terms if I ever had the chance,” Lee said. “That’s not to disrespect anybody that chooses to do that. Everybody’s different, and I wanted to do it my way.” Photo Lee in the 2010 N.B.A. All-Star Game. Credit Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Lee, mind you, is the first to admit that it was far easier for him to exit early, because he had already won the championship that so many players in their 30s feel compelled to keep chasing. He won it in 2014-15, in the last of his five seasons with the Golden State Warriors. Lee’s hamstring injury in training camp opened the lineup spot that the inimitably loquacious and versatile Draymond Green has never relinquished, but Warriors fans will remember Lee as the first marquee acquisition of the Joe Lacob/Peter Guber ownership era, as Stephen Curry’s good buddy and as Golden State’s first All-Star after a drought of 15 seasons. You can look it up: For all of his supposed defensive liabilities, Lee in 2010 became the Knicks’ first All-Star since Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston in 2001, then in 2013 became the Warriors’ first All-Star since, again, Sprewell in 1997. But it is the title, Lee said, that “changes everything.” “To retire without having a championship, I think there would really be something missing,” he added. “And I would probably be doing what a lot of vets are doing — trying to align themselves with any team that has a chance.” That was the original plan in late June when he declined his 2017-18 player option with the San Antonio Spurs. And there were a few job offers for this season, after Lee surprised his detractors by carving out a role under the Spurs’ Gregg Popovich, a famously demanding coach like Brown. Lee earned Popovich’s respect, even praise, despite not being a noted defender or 3-point shooter — typically prerequisites to earn the coach’s trust. Lee, though, did not get the sort of offer he was hoping for. He had convinced himself to hold out for a spot with a true title contender, or a team promising major minutes. When neither situation materialized, starting the next chapter proved too tempting, especially once Lee factored in the good life he had built off the court to go with that championship ring in his safe. After a summer of injury rehabilitation on his left knee, and just days before his retirement announcement, Lee got engaged to the Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, who enjoyed a career renaissance in 2017. While their relationship was blossoming, Wozniacki was rebounding to reach No. 3 in the world, after falling as low as No. 74 last year. Photo Lee and his fiancée, Caroline Wozniacki, during a practice session at the United States Open this summer. Wozniacki, No. 3 in the women’s tennis rankings, sometimes hits with Lee, who was a junior player. “But it’s not a very pleasant experience,” he said, “because she’s very competitive and there’s nothing I can really do.” Credit Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Amid all that, Lee also accepted an offer from the Golden State minority owner Chamath Palihapitiya to enter the world of venture capital. So he is a rookie all over again, poised to start a new job that will allow him to split time between the Bay Area and Manhattan, which also happens to be one of Wozniacki’s favorite places when she can manage a break from tour travel. The stays on the West Coast should allow Lee to keep up with Curry, who was drafted by the Warriors a year before Lee’s arrival. “I think from the start we both had a chip on our shoulder when he came to the Warriors that we were going to try to start something new,” Curry said, explaining why, on top of their natural pick-and-roll chemistry, he and Lee formed such a close bond. They hatched so many superstitions and quirky sayings that it seemed at times to those in the Golden State locker room that the two had their own language. To this day, when he thinks of the Warriors’ title run in 2015, Curry refers to himself and Lee as “the last two standing” from Golden State’s bad old days. “I’m so happy for him,” Curry said. “He’s at peace because he is going out on his own terms, to an extent, which is great. Not everybody gets that opportunity.” Lee isn’t leaving sports completely. He has accompanied Wozniacki to the last two United States Opens, and at 6-foot-9, he is easy to spot at his fiancée’s matches. It turns out he even has a little-known tennis background. A left-hander, Lee was an accomplished junior at the 12-and-under level in St. Louis area before deciding to focus on his eventual profession. And now, with basketball behind him, he has begun the reconstruction of his tennis game in hopes of becoming a more credible foil for Wozniacki on the practice court. “We’ve hit a handful of times,” Lee said. “But it’s not a very pleasant experience, because she’s very competitive and there’s nothing I can really do. Photo Lee with Stephen Curry after a 2015 Warriors game in Boston. The pair have remained close friends. Credit Maddie Meyer/Getty Images “I can still serve it O.K.,” he continued, “and I’m still pretty good when I get to the net. But getting back timing on groundstrokes — and now at this height — it’s not easy.” Nor is squeezing that N.B.A.-size frame into a tiny courtside seat to watch his future wife play one of the world’s loneliest sports. “I tell people all the time — I don’t really get that nervous for a basketball game,” Lee said. “But to watch a one-on-one battle when Caroline’s playing and not be able to do anything except cheer, it’s as nerve-racking as it gets for me in life. It’s very difficult to watch when I want her to win so bad.” Joining #TeamCaro also means that he is routinely subjected to tennis trash talk via text from his former Dallas Mavericks teammate Dirk Nowitzki — “Dirk loves to give me a hard time if Caroline is playing a German,” Lee said — but he has been prepped to handle pretty much anything by now. “When you start your career playing for Larry and end your career playing for Pop, you can’t do much better than that,” Lee said. A half-decade in front of Madison Square Garden audiences also tends to toughen an athlete. “The best way to put it is that it’s like you’re on an audition every single game,” Lee said. “You’re on a stage. No matter where you are in the standings, you’re in the spotlight at all times. “I don’t know why, but for some reason I always enjoyed that.” A version of this article appears in print on December 3, 2017, on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: An All-Star Who Ended Ugly Streaks Starts His New Life.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought. But it looks like we could be granted a reprieve from the fourth horseman of the weather apocalypse—hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration updated its hurricane forecast on Thursday, and hey, good news. Due to a burgeoning El Niño, it’s likely that the rest of Atlantic hurricane season will be quieter than normal. It only takes one hurricane to do damage, though, and the peak of hurricane season is still ahead, so we’re not out of the woods yet. The forecast calls for 4-7 hurricanes, of which up to two could become major ones with winds of Category 3 or greater strength. All told, NOAA is forecasting there will be 9-13 named storms. That includes tropical storms, hurricanes’ weaker sibling (though they can still dump copious amounts of rain). Overall, forecasters give this season 60 percent odds of being less active than usual, a huge uptick from the 25 percent forecast issued in May. Saharan dust has played a role in tamping down activity, as have cooler-than-normal waters in the part of the Atlantic where tropical storms and hurricanes tend to form. But the biggest reason forecasters think this year could be quiet is the creeping presence of an El Niño, which is characterized by warm waters in the eastern tropical Pacific. Those warm waters kickstart a series of changes in the atmosphere, including powerful upper level winds that cut across the Atlantic hurricane basin and tear storms apart or prevent them from spinning up at all. Some storm systems will inevitably defy the odds, though, which is why forecasters continue to urge anyone living near the coast to stay vigilant. “There are still more storms to come—the hurricane season is far from being over,” Gerry Bell, NOAA’s lead seasonal hurricane forecaster, said in a statement. This Atlantic hurricane season has been a bit of a weird one so far. It started a few days early when a subtropical storm (yet another flavor of hurricane-like weather) formed in the Gulf of Mexico. Said storm then turned tropical as it passed over land and basically made landfall again on the Great Lakes, all of which is extremely not normal. Three other storms have formed including tiny ass Hurricane Beryl, the first hurricane of the season. The lower odds of a season of horrors like last year are a welcome forecast if ever there was one even with the statistical peak of hurricane season still ahead and the official end months away.","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought.

Mark Kaufman,"During the fall of the Maya civilization over 1,000 years ago, kings were killed in public, captives were taken hostage, and in one notably violent event in the city of Aguateca, Maya fled their homes during a surprise assault, without time to even grab their belongings. Though warfare can't be ignored, the toppling of the classic Maya civilization — renown for its massive stone temples and astronomical observatories — is believed to have another formidable culprit: crippling drought. And for the first time, scientists have deduced just how severe this centuries-long drought may have been. SEE ALSO: 2018 is only halfway over, but a troubling climate change trend is already apparent Rainfall was slashed in half over a vast swath of the low-lying Maya lands, researchers demonstrate in a study published in the journal Science on Thursday. Over this 200-year period, rainfall sometimes plummeted by 70 percent in the region, which encompasses much of today's Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Stone mask of the Maya rain God ‘Chaac’ in the Yucatán Peninsula. Image: MARK BRENNER ""If you imagine your local area, imagine if rainfall was reduced by half — but [for] over a hundred years,"" Nick Evans, a lead author of the study and paleoclimatologist at the University of Cambridge, said in an interview. Many lands would simply turn to desert, or doom once fertile agricultural areas. Take Los Angeles today, which historically gets 14 or 15 inches of rain a year. A decline by half, combined with the sun drying the land, would almost certainly transform it into an arid desert. And, unlike Californians today, the Maya didn't have the benefit of 21st Century aqueduct and reservoir systems. They lived on an expanse of flat land with little surface water. They needed rain dearly: Stone-carved masks of the Maya's rain god ""Chaac"" are prevalent throughout the ruins of the society. Hunting for ancient water To give the Maya drought a firmer number, Evans and his team gathered sediments from the bottom of Lake Chichancanab, a long, slender, salty lake in the heart of Maya country. They were in search of the mineral gypsum, which when forming, grabs water from the lake and traps the molecules. During times of evaporation, lakes become heavier in certain types of the water's oxygen and hydrogen, which gave researchers a confident idea of how fast the lake was disappearing. ""It's almost like measuring the lake water itself,"" said Evans. Modern day Lake Chichancanab Image: Mark Brenner Jason Briner, a paleoclimatologist at the University at Buffalo who had no involvement in the research, called the study ""very elegant,"" allowing the scientists to narrow in on just how much — or little — rain fell during the decline of the Maya. ""Bottom line: A series of droughts with 50 percent the average rainfall probably played a big role in a major shift in Maya civilization at that time,"" Briner said over email. A crippling drought may have further unsettled an already failing political structure, where elite royalty ruled society. Strained agricultural land may have also led to collapses in crop yields. And overpopulation — as estimates range that between 3 million and 11 million Maya inhabited the area — may have precipitated a scarcity of resources, further destabilizing the once infallible elites. ""If it all comes together, you may have a perfect storm,"" Daniela Triadan, an anthropologist at the University of Arizona who studies the Maya's mysterious past, said in an interview. The fall of the Maya The fall of the Maya, however, didn't completely extinguish their people. ""They didn’t quite disappear,"" Takeshi Inomata, also an anthropologist at the University of Arizona who had no involvement in the study, said in an interview. Ruins of the 31 meter-tall (100-foot) Pirámide de los Cinco Pisos. Image: Mark Brenner Maya descendants still live in the area today. Rather, the major Maya centers, built by elites, collapsed, said Inomata. These congested cities or population centers were already likely difficult places to live, even in the best of times. ""It was probably incredibly smelly and dirty, with people dumping garbage outside of their houses,"" said Triadan. ""It was sweaty, and hotter than hell."" And then, in some of these heavily populated places, the terrible drought came, and didn't lift for centuries. However, drought can't explain why everyone in Maya society abandoned their cities and villages. In the vast expanse of the southern lowlands, Inomata and Triadan said people deserted some flourishing population centers before the drought even hit. ""Why did the southern region seem to be doing well, and then why were they the first to leave and not come back?"" asked Triadan. ""I don’t think we can reduce it to climatic issues."" Ruins of the ancient Maya city of Calakmul. Image: Eduardo Fuster Salamero/imageBROKER/REX/Shutterstock The Maya civilization, then, declined in different ways in different areas, over a few centuries. ""The situation in each of these cities wasn’t the same,"" noted Triadan. The ancient drought is worth considering today, as climate change is driving precipitation extremes around the globe, like in California and parts of Africa. ""One might argue that we are more resilient to climate change than our predecessors — that we are able to better weather the types of drought conditions in California, or elsewhere across the West,"" said Briner. ""As much of the West is currently in flames, I’m not so convinced,"" he said, noting the large fires currently besieging California. ""And, as many drought-prone areas around the world become drier, climate change will stress the already stressed harder,"" he added. ""Yikes.""","During the fall of the Maya civilization over 1,000 years ago, kings were killed in public, captives were taken hostage, and in one notably violent event in the city of Aguateca, Maya fled their homes during a surprise assault, without time to even grab their…",2018-08-02T19:57:42Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",The fall of the Maya civilization was bloody and worsened by a 200-year drought,https://mashable.com/2018/08/02/maya-civilization-drought-collapse-climate-change/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/b-PVh0pA5_mgfeXMfbh7D6oZ0SI=/1200x630/2018%2F08%2F02%2Fdf%2F83839fb2c9c34660a101bdeab23f2a57.67b3b.jpg,mashable,Mashable,drought,1
Jessica Boddy,"The ancient Maya were an innovative people. They constructed intricate cities throughout the tropical lowlands of the Yucatán Peninsula, communicated using one of the world’s first written languages, and created two calendar systems by studying the stars. But despite their achievements, the thriving Mayan civilization mysteriously collapsed sometime between the eighth and ninth centuries. We still don’t know exactly why. The general consensus is that the Mayan collapse was caused by a number of things, including disease, war, and other sociopolitical conflicts. One natural factor may have contributed to all of these issues: drought. A particularly bad drought would have made it difficult for the Maya to collect enough drinking water and to irrigate their crops. It also could have encouraged the spread of disease and increased the strain between Mayan leaders and their people. Now, a new study quantifies just how harsh the Mayan droughts were. “We already knew that final stages of the Terminal Classic Maya period were characterized by severe droughts,” Fernando Gázquez-Sánchez, a study author and geochemist at St. Andrew University in Scotland, told Gizmodo. “However, our investigation evaluates the intensity of these dry periods.” By analyzing sediment from Lake Chichancanab in the Yucatán Peninsula, Gázquez-Sánchez and his colleagues found that compared to today, annual rainfall decreased by between 41 percent and 54 percent over the multi-decade Mayan drought. When the drought was most severe, rainfall plummeted by as much as 70 percent, the researchers wrote in their study published Thursday in Science. “This really represents the next step in understanding how drought affected the Ancient Maya,” Peter Douglas, a geochemist from McGill University who did not work on the study, told Gizmodo. “The authors are using very refined analytical techniques... and the result is that the droughts must have been very bad.” The team also found that the region’s relative humidity fell by somewhere between 2 percent and 7 percent compared to today’s climate. Those numbers have less direct implications for ancient Mayan crops, but they are an indicator that climate change was happening on a larger scale, Cambridge paleoclimatologist and co-author Nick Evans told Gizmodo. The key to unlocking all of these figures is a mineral in the lake sediment called gypsum. Gypsum forms down at the bottoms of lakes during droughts or dry conditions. In doing so, it traps water molecules in its structure, effectively preserving them like a “water fossil,” said Evans. The team developed a method to extract that thousand-year-old water and study the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes inside. During drought conditions, lighter water isotopes evaporate first, and the heavier isotopes are left to be trapped in gypsum. By tallying when those heavy isotopes were more common, the researchers were able to create rainfall and humidity estimates. Gázquez-Sánchez said this method of analyzing “fossilized water” could reveal a lot about worldwide climates ranging back millions of years. It could even tell us about the climate histories of other planets: Mars, for instance, also has gypsum deposits. “Our method could be used to analyze gypsum either onboard a rover vehicle, or eventually on Earth from a sample return mission,” Gázquez-Sánchez told Gizmodo. “This may open the door to reconstruct the past climate on Mars.” There’s still a lot the method could reveal about the ancient Mayan civilization collapse, too. Douglas told Gizmodo the new study is definitely a preliminary one, and is more of a jumping off point. But it is promising. “To move forward, we need better information on when and where drought happened,” he said. “If we can repeat these techniques in more locations, and get more precise ages for these kinds of geochemical signals, then climate scientists can really begin to work closely with archaeologists to understand how drought impacted the Maya in detail.” [ Science ]","The ancient Maya were an innovative people.

Credit Rijasolo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images • In 2015, the combination of rising demand for chocolate in Asian countries, unusual weather in major cocoa-producing countries of West Africa and attacks of fungus resulted in higher prices for chocolate. The factors just happened to coincide with Valentine’s Day. Britain is particularly vulnerable to shifts in the international food system: It imports almost a third of its food, and a weaker currency, driven in part by uncertainty over the country’s exit from the European Union next year, could make groceries even more expensive. The unexpectedly severe drought in India o f the past few years has affected hundreds of millions of people in the country. It has also had consequences for global markets, including for chickpeas, as India typically produces 10 times the amount of the legume as the next-biggest producer, according to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In Britain, hummus has quickly gone from being a niche snack, introduced to supermarkets in the 1990s, to being a staple. The dish, a specialty of the Middle East and the Mediterranean, was voted one of the products most likely to be found in Britons’ fridges in a 2013 survey of European food habits. Annual sales of hummus in the country total more than 100 million pounds, or about $140 million, up about 50 percent from four years ago, according to the research firm Kantar Worldpanel. Indeed, worldwide demand for hummus has driven up interest in chickpea production, and analysts expect a shift toward healthier eating will continue to bolster the dish’s popularity. Farmers in the United States, for example, were forecast to drastically raise their chickpea harvests last year, according to official data, after what was already a record year in 2016. And scientists from Scotland and Ethiopia are jointly exploring the development of drought-resistant chickpeas. For now, some manufacturers in Britain are trying to absorb the higher costs. Ramona Hazan’s London-based business, Ramona’s Kitchen, makes about 75 tons of hummus a month, both for supermarkets and for sale directly to customers. Each 250-gram tub costs about £1.60, but tighter margins resulting from higher chickpea prices mean she is now looking at diversifying. “We might look at pea and mint dips, extend our range to things not as chickpea-based,” Ms. Hazan said. Others have taken to searching for options elsewhere. AGT Poortman, which supplies chickpeas to companies that make hummus for British supermarkets, said its prices had increased around 40 percent from 2015 to 2017. To supply clients, it has asked them to allow it to buy chickpeas from a wider variety of places.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Farmers are struggling to afford even feeding their animals Australia's most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), is now entirely in drought, officials have confirmed. A dry winter has intensified what has been called the worst drought in living memory in parts of eastern Australia. NSW produces about a quarter of Australia's agricultural output. It was officially listed as ""100% in drought"" on Wednesday. The state and federal governments have provided A$576m (£330m; $430m) in emergency relief funding. The money is intended to assist farmers who are struggling with failing crops, water shortages and the cost of feeding animals. ""There isn't a person in the state that isn't hoping to see some rain for our farmers and regional communities,"" said NSW Minister for Primary Industries Niall Blair. On Sunday, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull warned that the country had become a ""land of drought"". Less than 10mm (0.4in) of rain was recorded in parts of NSW in July, officials said. Drier than normal conditions are forecast in the coming months. Mr Turnbull said farmers recognised that drought was ""part of the Australian climate"", but they needed support. Farmers in NSW were spending up to A$10,000 per truckload of hay to feed their animals, he said. ""What we have to is make sure we [the government] back them in when the times get as tough as they are now,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation earlier this week.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Were going to lose thousands of dollars worth of shrimp, T.J. said. And dont ask about the oysters. The shrimp business is off and on, always, he said. The oyster business has been really bad. Really bad. There are so few wild oysters left that the Wards turned to oyster farming two years ago. They did not yet know the status of their 750,000 to one million farmed oysters after the storm. We never thought it wouldve been this bad, said Melanie Ward, T.J.s wife. Downtown Apalachicola, with its neatly painted storefronts, counted itself lucky, despite the surge of seawater that left debris strewn everywhere. Shops that had been boarded up with plywood showed minimal damage a shattered window here, a watermark there. A county hospital that closed before the storm had a damaged roof. The bridge leading into town, proudly named after John Gorrie, the native son who helped pioneer air-conditioning, had reopened, though parts of it were limited to one lane and a sign warned, Drive at your own risk! Across the bay in Eastpoint, Apalachicolas more modest neighbor, where the slogan is Oysters since 1898, parts of scenic U.S. Highway 98 looked like a ghost town, the sand-swept road lined with mountains of wood where bayside shacks had stood before the storm. Eastpoint, at the foot of a state forest named Tates Hell, had already endured tragedy this year, when a wildfire caused by an out-of-control prescribed burn burned down 30 homes. When that happened, Apalachicola restaurateurs got together and fed their downtrodden neighbors. On Thursday, the cooks joined forces again, this time for a cookout in Apalachicola. Under makeshift tents outside Tamaras Café, they set up gas-powered grills and brought out food that would otherwise spoil in their powerless kitchens.","The small oyster town of Apalachicola, on a remote point on the Gulf of Mexico, had already suffered through drought and an oil spill.

George Dvorsky,"From floods and rain to droughts and unseasonably warm conditions, here’s the weather that Americans can expect in the coming months. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its long term weather forecast for Spring 2018, the period running from April until the end of June. Importantly, NOAA’s projections are just that: projections. They’re based on probabilities churned from intense number crunching and historical data. As always, stay tune to local weather conditions for more accurate reports as the season unfolds. Temperatures are expected to be above average for the southern two-thirds of the continental United States, extending from California to the central Plains and into the Northeast. Places most likely to be warmer than usual this spring include an area extending from the southwest across Texas and into the Gulf Coast. The northern half of Alaska and Hawaii should also be warmer than usual. Only the northern rockies will see temperatures below the norm. Right now, more than a quarter of the United States is experiencing drought, including southern California, the southwest, the northern and southern High Plains, and parts of the Southeast. NOAA expects drought to continue in most of these places, and even expand by June. On the positive side, drought conditions should wane in the northern Plains and the lower Missouri Valley owing to the usual spring rains. Speaking of rain, those of you in the northern United States can expect wetter-than-average conditions this spring, from the northern High Plains through to the Great Lakes region, Ohio Valley, and into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Hawaii and northern Alaska are also expected to see a bit more rain than usual. Below average precipitation is expected in the west and south, including California, the south-central plains—and in Texas and areas of Oklahoma where drought conditions are in effect. Spring hasn’t arrived, but heavy rainfall has already triggered flooding in the Ohio and Mississippi River basins, and record flooding has been recorded in the lower Great Lakes region. Until the end of May, folks in the lower Mississippi Valley, the Ohio River Basin, the Illinois River Basin, and in parts of the lower Missouri River Basin, should expect moderate flooding. People living near the Columbia River and upper Missouri River Basin aren’t off the hook, either, where minor flooding is possible thanks to the heavy snowpack that built up this winter. Mike Halpert from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center can tell you a bit more about what to expect this spring in this video. Again, stay tuned to local weather conditions, and be prepared for changing conditions.

JOHN SCHWARTZ,"Brad Udall, a senior scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on water supplies in the West, told a congressional panel last month that the lower basin uses about 10.2 million acre-feet of water from the river each year, while upstream flows provide just nine million. (An acre-foot is the volume of one foot of water over one acre, about 325,000 gallons.)
Beyond that drain, climate change is bringing on a long-term crisis. The Colorado River, and the entire Southwest, has shifted to a new hotter and drier climate, and, equally important, will continue to shift to a hotter and drier climate for several decades after we stop emitting greenhouse gases, he said in his testimony.
In an interview, Mr. Udall said the influence of climate change was already apparent in the West. Climate change is not some distant process, he said. Its here, its now, its in our faces. Its creating messes we have to deal with.
Jonathan T. Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan, said that politicians and policymakers needed to factor climate change into their plans. Lack of river water will lead people to pump more groundwater, which was deposited in the ice ages. Were using this fossil groundwater in unsustainable ways, he said.
In a warming world, Dr. Overpeck said, less water in rivers and lakes is inevitable, whatever relief a wet season might bring. But for the most part, Western political leaders dont want to talk about it, he said. It is the disaster thats over the horizon, if we dont talk about it.

Eric Niiler,"Beer drinkers might pay more and find less of their favorite beverage as climate change comes for barley. Scientists expect that extreme droughts and heat waves will become more frequent and intense in the regions that grow the grain. Many farmers are already adapting to the slowly warming planetwith advanced plant breeding techniques to create more drought-resistant grains, for example, and by using more efficient irrigation systems to conserve waterbut a new study out today in the journal Nature Plants says that many regions wont be able to cope with the arid conditions of the future. The work was done by a group of researchers in China along with Steven J. Davis, an environmental scientist at the University of California Irvine. The team looked at the areas around the world that grow barley, which is turned into malt for beer, and projected what will occur under five different climate warming scenarios by 2100. Using models of both economic activity and climate change, the group made predictions about what will happen to barley production, as well as beer price and consumption. During the most severe climate events, the study predicts that global beer consumption would decline by 16 percent, an amount about equal to the total annual beer consumption of the United States in 2011. It also expects average beer prices to double. Each country would be affected differently. The price of a single pint of beer in Ireland, for example, will rise by $4.84, followed by $4.52 in Italy and $4.34 in Canada. American tipplers will see beer prices rise up to $1.94 under the extreme events, the study said, and barley farmers will export more to other nations. Davis, who has published several papers on climate change and the Chinese economy, says many extreme drought and heat events will force farmers to feed barley to livestock instead of selling it to domestic breweries. When we have these shortages, our models suggest people are going to feed the barley to the livestock before they make beer, Davis said. That makes sense. This is a luxury commodity and its more important to have food on the table. The effects of climate change are already being felt by craft brewers, says Katie Wallace, director of social and environmental responsibility at New Belgium Brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado. In 2014, the US barley-growing regionMontana, North Dakota and Idahowas hit by an extremely wet and warm winter that caused crops to sprout early, rendering much of it useless. Farmers were forced to tap into reserves in storage. In 2017 and again this past summer, the Pacific Northwest was hit by severe drought that affected production of hops that give unique flavors to craft brews. Wallace says that climate change is on the minds of all craft brewers as they plan for how to avoid future shortages of both barley and hops. Its stressful, Newman said. We are seeing an increased level of vulnerability and some near escapes in some cases. All of these things have happened periodically, but the frequency is growing. The craft beer industry is already planning for the future, says Chris Swersey, a supply chain specialist at the Brewers Association, a trade group that represents 4,500 small breweries across the country. Swersey says he is skeptical of the papers findings, mainly because it assumes that the amount and location of barley production will stay the same as it is today. He says barley growing is already moving north to Canada, while researchers are hoping to expand barley's range with winter-hardy breeds. The industry is already aware that barley production is shifting, Swersey says. We need to be thinking ahead and be smart about what is our climate going to look like 50 or 100 years from now. Its not just the little guys who are thinking of climate change. The king of US beer production remains Budweiser, which produces the number 1 (Bud Light) and number 3 (Budweiser) top-selling brands. Budweiser buys barley from a vast network of farmers in the northern US and is investing in new breeds of drought-resistant barley strains, according to Jessica Newman, director of agronomy for Budweiser. Its all about getting the right varieties, getting the right mix, and getting the right technology to our growers, Newman says from her office in Idaho Falls, Idaho. She says Budweisers crop science lab in Colorado is working on new barley strains dubbed Voyager, Merit 57 and Growler. We are breeding for drought resistance and sprout resistance, Newman said. If we see rainfall coming earlier, or if it rains in the wrong time of year, the barley can sprout and it wouldnt be used. We also want it to use less water and fewer agricultural chemicals. Climate scientist Davis says he and his colleagues wrote the study as a thought exercise to perhaps stoke conversation about how climate change affects our daily lives. A paper on beer might seem a little bit frivolous when it's dealing with a topic that poses existential threats, Davis said. But some of us have a personal love of beer and thought this might be interesting. Climate change wont just alter the weather; itll also hit our grocery tabs and hobbies.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Alexandria Villasenor doesnt remember a world without climate change. When she was eight, Folsom Lake, the reservoir practically in her backyard in Davis, dried up amidst Californias epic drought. She peered at the dead fish on its former shores and felt her anxiety about the future start to grow.
The 13 year old has since moved to New York, but she was back visiting friends and family in Davis recently when the Camp Fire struck 90 miles to the north. Smoke wafted over Northern California, creating the most toxic air on the planet. Fearing for her health, Villasenor left. And in that moment, she knew she couldnt idly accept a future of ever-worsening drought, fires, and weather whiplash turning her home state into a climate change-fueled wasteland.
Villasenor cant yet vote intransigent politicians out of office or run herself. But she found inspiration in Greta Thunberg, the 15 year old Swedish activist who began striking each Friday in the run up to Swedens September 2018 elections to protest inaction on climate change and who has inspired tens of thousands of youths across Europe to follow suit. Eight weeks ago, Villasenor started walking to the United Nations in her own Friday climate strike, a tradition that continued this Friday in the face of polar vortex-fueled cold. Now, shes calling for a nationwide school strike on March 15 to talk about our future and send a message to adults to get their act together at this pivotal moment in history.
Like Thunberg, Villansenor speaks in blunt terms. 
If were not going to have a future, then school wont matter any more, Villasenor told Earther, explaining why she hopes students across the country will take to the streets.
Villasenors path to activism is both unique and all too common for her generation, which is growing up in a time where climate changes impacts are increasing apparent and time is running out to radically transform the worlds economy to confront the crisis. Since Thunberg began striking in Sweden last August, huge numbers of students have taken up the cause under the banner of #fridaysforfuture as the movement has spread across social media. Students went on strike in Poland at last years major climate conference where Thunberg also spoke. In Australia, which is currently broiling under a blistering heat wave likely fueled by climate change, an estimated 15,000 students went on strike in November. Just this Thursday, 45,000 students walked out of classes in Belgium.
Yet in the U.S., despite its huge role in causing climate change, has seen just a smattering of strikers across the country since Villasenor began her protest at the U.N. She pointed to rigid U.S. values and fear of breaking from them as some reasons the student strike movement has yet to catch on here. But in her view, now is the time for rule breaking.
We now have to start being more direct. Were not going to get anything done if we keep going by the rules, she said.
By setting a firm date of March 15, Villasenor said she hopes to galvanize a bigger, sustained movement. Student strikers in Australia and Europe have said theyll be taking to the streets in solidarity, and Uganda and Thailand strikers are considering action as well. The organizing is being done by a loose organization of students who check in on regular calls as well as Twitter DMs and Facebook Messenger. But Villansenor said other climate activism groups are planning to show their support with direct actions, including 350, Extinction Rebellion, and the Sunrise Movement. 
The theme will be coming together collectively to reimagining our future and how to get there.
If everyone gets involved, then more ideas can circulate around, Villansenor said. It will have to be a group project of the whole world. 
A little over a year ago, Splinters Hamilton Nolan wrote about the need for a general labor strike in response to continued assaults on the middle and lower class by the oligarch class. The words could just as easily apply to the students striking for their future:
One big strike. Labor is everyone. Look around. There is no one coming to save us. We can only save ourselves.","Alexandria Villasenor doesn’t remember a world without climate change.

"Ari Phillips on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","North Atlantic right whales are living the plot of a science fiction story: They are not having any babies. With the end of the winter calving season just around the corner, so far zero newborns have been spotted. With fewer than 450 of the whales remaining, and around 100 breeding females, this reproductive drought is the worst-case scenario for the imperiled species. Brian Sharp, Marine Mammal Rescue and Research manager with the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), told Earther that the calfless season adds to a disturbing trend of sub-par years for the whales, and that it’s “becoming more and more apparent how dire the situation is.” “The worst-case scenario is right now, we are there,” he said. “We’ve seen 18 known mortalities since 2016, and one of the things we know is that for every known mortality, whales die that we will never see.” North Atlantic right whales have been on the endangered species list since 1970 after being hunted to near-extinction by commercial whalers in the late 19th century. It looked like they were on a slow and steady rebound until about a decade ago. Since then, their numbers have started to come down due to a combination of environmental changes, entanglement in fishing lines, and encounters with ships. While the whales have averaged about 17 births per year over the last 30 years—with just one calf spotted in 2000, but 31 the next year—births have been below average for the past five years. If this trend doesn’t reverse soon, it will be hard not to consider extinction a real possibility. Sharp said that low calving years are to be expected, but if the 100 or so breeding females are not reproducing pretty regularly, then the species is in deep trouble. With whales being apex marine animals, their decline or success is indicative of our overall progress at protecting the ocean, according to Sharp. “They show us the health of the ocean,” he said, “and if we can’t preserve the species, then the oceans are failing.” North Atlantic right whales typically give birth off the southeastern coast of the U.S. between December and March before returning to their feeding grounds in the northeast in mid-April. Last year, two previously unseen babies were spotted in Cape Cod Bay after the migrating to the feeding grounds, and scientists will be watching closely for any potentially unnoticed newborns. But not even their feeding grounds are reliable anymore. As the Gulf of Maine warms due to climate change, their traditional food supply —tiny crustaceans called copepods—is shifting to waters with less strict protections from fast-moving ships and other threats. As Earther previously reported, under conditions of abundant prey, an average of just 13 human-caused deaths per year could cause North Atlantic right whales to decline toward extinction. But if the amount of prey in the ocean is reduced, toward levels similar to those seen in the 1990s, just 10 additional right whale mortalities annually could spell doom. Last year’s unusual mortality event, in which there was a total of 17 confirmed dead stranded whales—12 in Canada and five in the U.S.—easily exceeded these worrisome thresholds. Sharp said when the whales are forced to go to different areas at different times of year to find food, “they are not going to have that protection, that dynamic management system” that was developed over years of surveys. “It’s all human causes so it is all up to humans to fix them.” Regina Asmutis-Silvia, Executive Director of Whale and Dolphin Conservation North America, told Earther that as the climate changes and food supplies shift, right whales may not be getting the best sources of food, either. She said this is just one of a combination of factors causing her to grow increasingly concerned for the viability of the species. For instance, Asmutis-Silvia said that even when the whales don’t die from entanglement, the stress can impact their ability reproduce. “Entanglements can impact the female’s ability to feed, leaving her in poorer condition so she can’t calf, or it could also be the physical stress from the entanglement that increases her stress hormones and puts her in poorer condition,” she said, adding that ocean noise can also increase stress and inhibit reproduction. Bottom line, according to Asmutis-Silvia, is the need to stop killing the whales faster than they can reproduce. “It’s all human causes so it is all up to humans to fix them,” she said. In her opinion, it’s morally unacceptable for two affluent nations, the U.S. and Canada—which both have the means and legal mandate to protect the whales—to willingly allow them to edge closer to extinction. Preventing these unnecessary deaths can be done by taking measures to reduce fishing gear entanglements, reducing ship speeds in vulnerable areas so collisions are non-lethal, and enacting better monitoring and warning tools. Many of these initiatives remain voluntary in the U.S. and Canada, but as the degree of the problem becomes more apparent, federal and state authorities along with researchers and fishing and shipping industry members are looking for effective ways to better address the issue. “Perhaps right whales will finally be the species that grabs the public’s attention and makes everyone take notice about the growing number of threats facing the ocean and its inhabitants,” she said. Perhaps.","North Atlantic right whales are living the plot of a science fiction story: They are not having any babies.

Alex Wilhelm,"After years of drought and parched conditions, the U.S. tech IPO market could see a number of well-known players push forward with their debuts in 2018. That sentiment is grounded in the number of companies currently rumored to have filed or started preparation for a public debut. However, the wave may not manifest. In the past few years, there has been a surprising dearth of IPO activity. That lack of tech IPOs matters for the technology industry as liquidity is often the stuff that drives reinvestment. Notably, raising capital hasn’t been a problem for venture capitalists. But different forms of money are distorting the tech ecosystem’s makeup. It may be harder to raise seed money than before. That said, it may be easier to raise super-late-stage funds. Hell, even pre-seed has cropped up due to the market’s current oddities. But venture capitalists are, to some degree, raising on borrowed time. Paper returns must become real at some point. And given the sheer towering amount of frozen value amongst the Valley’s unicorns, there is quite a lot of defrosting to get to. Therefore, 2018’s IPO market matters quite a lot. With that in mind, let’s peek at the state of unicorns looking to go public. Market are good while IPOs are bad The American stock market is on a historic tear, regularly setting all-time highs while the president trumpets each new threshold the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaks. The Nasdaq is now thousands of points higher than the high watermark it set in the dot-com boom. Times are good, but the IPO cadence is not, as we alluded to above. Last December, Chris O’Brien of VentureBeat reported some data about the recent IPO market that was succinct: As for tech [in 2017], there were 37 IPOs that raised $9.9 billion. Again, that’s a solid increase from the 21 IPOs in 2016 that raised a paltry $2.9 billion. But it’s still considerably below the 56 IPOs in 2014 that raised $32.9 billion. That data, covering the U.S. market, shows the massive gaps in liquidity over the years. Why the data isn’t stronger when it comes to the number of IPOs that we see in the domestic market, especially in light of 2017’s ebullient stock market, isn’t clear. Put another way: If you weren’t going public when the Nasdaq was shooting past 7,000, what the hell were you doing? So markets are up, and IPOs may finally follow suit. Who is crashing through? Let’s find out. Who’s next? Partially summing the 2018 IPO narrative this morning was Axios’s Dan Primack. He noted that a number of famous unicorns are pushing toward public debuts: Unicorn stampede: Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has picked banks for an upcoming IPO that could value the company at $100 billion, per Reuters. This comes on top of the confidential filing for Dropbox, Spotify’s direct listing plan and continuing talk of a first-half Lyft float. We’ve covered the Spotify direct listing, Dropbox’s private filing and Lyft’s finances, as well. Xiaomi is a firm that we’ve yet to really hit on from a financial angle, which we’ll fix. But the list is large enough to warrant attention as-is. Add in Pinterest’s ever-rumored IPO, and the list starts to look impressive. Indeed, the amount of market value that could go public is huge: Dropbox’s last private valuation was $10 billion ; Spotify is now worth $19 billion ; Pinterest is worth $12.3 billion ; and Lyft is worth $11.5 billion. According to some reports, Xiaomi could be looking for a $100 billion valuation in its flotation. If all those IPOs actually happen this year, it would pump quite a lot of cash-on-cash returns through the VC ecosystem ahead of an inevitable correction. If that happens, perhaps VCs can raise again before summer turns to winter. Autumn may persist, however, as these prior warnings from 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2017 show. Even we got into the snark about this same situation one year ago. Happily for unicorn IPO bulls, there is more than mere IPO rumor to suggest that many big names will go public in 2018. Barrett Daniels, an IPO expert, accountant and recent Equity guest, told Crunchbase News that he too has heard that IPOs are looking solid for the current year: “Literally everyone I know in the IPO world, and I am talking about some really smart people that are very much in the know when it comes to IPOs, think 2018 is going to be a monster year,” Daniels explained. “That said, guessing how the IPO market is going to play out in a given year is an impossible exercise and one that often makes people look silly.” That last quip, about looking silly, is quite fair. So before we leave with our hopes high for an active cycle, let’s caveat. Don’t get excited Even though market conditions look good, and there are companies long-incubated that are ready to go, don’t be too certain that we will indeed finally see the IPO wave that has long been expected. In the past, we have seen a wide range of results from IPO-ready companies. Box tried to go out but had to try again. AppDynamics nearly got out but got bought. Good Technology thought that it was going to go public, as well. It was wrong. So just because there are a number of companies pointing in the direction of an IPO does not guarantee that such an exit will happen. 2018 may finally be the year that 2017, 2016 and 2015 just couldn’t be. However, it could be a repeat. But today, the omens look positive.

JOSE A. DEL REAL,"He added that it was difficult to know what next year might bring in terms of rain and snowpack, and pointed out that many towns and areas that aren’t connected to the state water system are subject to limited water availability. “I think that gets to the heart of the issue,” Mr. Swain said. “How do we define ‘drought?’ There are different definitions formally, but I think in a practical sense it can mean a lot of things depending on your perspective.” Mr. Rizzardo urged Californians to remain mindful of how much water they are using. “Water conservation is a way of life in Southern California. But with a little precipitation, they get a little rain and they think, ‘We can run our sprinklers again!’” he said. “The day after we have our first good rainstorm, and I see my neighbor watering his lawn, I’m thinking, ‘Oh, god.’” California Online Photo Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the White House this month.

A handful of sign-wavers gathered outside the Joshua Tree courthouse Tuesday, where two parents were released amid accusations of felony child abuse. They were there to offer their support after the couple had spent five days behind bars. Last week, the parents, Daniel Panico and Mona Kirk, were arrested after police officers discovered their children living in a makeshift desert shelter made of plywood and thin sheeting. Garbage and human waste surrounded the area. Their three children were taken into protective custody. But since their arrest, another view has emerged. Friends and supporters have vocally questioned whether their living situation itself constitutes abuse. The couple’s supporters have accused the police of punishing the family for being poor, reflected on the signs: “Guilty of Being Poor” “Being Homeless is not a crime.” “Poverty is not a choice.” Mr. Panico and Ms. Kirk pleaded not guilty to the charges and were released, though they still do not have access to their children. “We are just minding our own business, trying to raise our three kids on little money,” Mr. Panico told The Los Angeles Times in the courtroom on Tuesday.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Weeks of extreme heat and drought have baked Welsh fields to a crisp. But amidst the desiccated remains of crops, bizarre circles of green have emerged. While I would like to tell you it’s aliens, it’s definitely not aliens. It’s the remains of ancient settlements emerging from centuries of slumber. These are crop marks, the 21st century’s answer to crop circles. Great Britain as a whole has been facing wild run of heat, with Wales getting the worst of it. The country just had its hottest June on record, according to the U.K. Met Office. The Porthmadog, a small port town in northwest Wales, recorded the hottest June temperature in the United Kingdom when it reached 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 degrees Fahrenheit) on June 28. At the same time, Wales recorded one of its five driest Junes on record, getting just 22 percent of its normal rainfall. It’s no surprise the fields have dried out, but the halos and lines of green in their midst—dubbed crop marks—are a shock. They’re relics of the Iron Age, a period which lasted from roughly 800 B.C. until 50 A.D., showing where forts and settlements once existed. Iron Age settlements in Wales were usually surrounded by ditches that acted as deterrents for would be invaders. Over time, those settlements were abandoned overrun by invading Romans, who effectively ended the Iron Age in the region. Top soil filled them in, making them both more fertile than the surrounding land and able to retain water. When the current drought hit, these relatively wetter, fertile patches of land have helped keep plants nourished even as everything around them dies, according to research by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW), which has been documenting the ghostly reminders of our ancestors. This latest dry, hot spell has provided an exceptional opportunity to view and catalog the sites—some which were already known—from the air. “We have had periods of dry weather in the past, where cropmarks and parching have exposed archaeology, but this current spell is really exceptional both in extent and longevity and the last time it was to this extent was probably back in the 1970s,” Louise Barker, a senior investigator of archeology at RCAHMW, told Earther. It’s a weird juxtaposition of how we used to live and how the way in which we live now is messing with the planet. While no analysis has been done of the current heat wave racking the U.K., research has shown that climate change is almost certainly playing a role in making heat waves around the world more intense and likely to occur. Future projections indicate more of the same: Wales, and indeed all of the U.K. is projected to get hotter and drier in the future, according to projections put together by the Met Office. “Whilst this obviously presents many challenges, one opportunity that arises from this is the discovery of new heritage sites in desiccated grassland and crops which are visible as parch and crop marks,” Barker said. Climate change has afforded weird archeological opportunities elsewhere in the world. Melting glaciers have offered a glimpse of life 6,000 years ago in Norway and thousands of years ago on Alaska’s North Slope, which researchers are now scrambling to excavate. In a more modern twist, NASA climate scientist Ben Cook pointed Earther toward remnants of forgotten towns that appeared after the recent five-year California drought caused reservoirs to drop precipitously. At the same time, a rise in drought conditions is making looting more likely in Mongolia by affecting herding opportunities, showing just one of the many ways climate change will have bizarre, unintended consequences.","Weeks of extreme heat and drought have baked Welsh fields to a crisp.

Jennifer Ouellette,"Enlarge / Barley grain used in the production of beer at the Asahi Kanagawa Brewery in Japan 9 There's nothing quite like putting your feet up after a long, hot summer day and enjoying a refreshing cold brew if you're a beer lover. But a warming climate could give rise to global barley shortages, with a resulting shortage of beer. That's the conclusion of a new study just published in Nature Plants. Beer brewers account for roughly 17 percent of the barley consumption worldwide, although it varies from region to region, with the vast majority of crops harvested as feed for livestock. If barley becomes too scarce, more of it will be funneled to livestock, since beer is technically a luxury good. The shortage of barley will give rise to steep price hikes and corresponding decreases in global consumption. While the most affluent beer lovers will still be able to indulge in a pint or two, ""Future climate and pricing conditions could put beer out of reach for hundreds of millions of people around the world,"" says study co-author Steven Davis of the University of California, Irvine. Davis himself is a beer aficionado and home brewer, who frequently travels to China for research collaborations. During one such trip a couple of years ago, he spoke with a scientist at the Chinese Agricultural Academy of Sciences, who was studying the global supply of beer. (China is currently the largest consumer of beer and thus would be hit hard by a severe barley shortage.) They decided to collaborate on a study investigating the impact of climate change on beer, partnering with other researchers in the United Kingdom and Mexico. Mad for mash Brewers start the process by exposing grain to moisture so that it germinates, converting the starches into sugars. When the sugar levels are just right, they roast the grains, resulting in a malt for kicking off the fermentation into beer. In principle, any grain can be malted: wheat, rye, corn, and rice. But for beer, barley is the undisputed king, because it germinates quickly and has a rich flavor when roasted. While brewers occasionally experiment with adding rice or wheat to their brews, ""That's usually frowned upon as padding,"" says Davis. ""The purists want you to use barley,"" Even wheat beers are still mostly barley. Barley farmers in Montana are already feeling the impact of a warmer climate, although they are more likely to talk publicly about ""erratic weather"" or ""drier, hotter summers"" in that Republican stronghold, rather than the politically charged ""climate change."" They are struggling to grow barley crops in more frequently occurring conditions of severe drought and extreme heat. Hot, dry weather compromises grain quality, making it more likely the barley will be sold as feed, at one-third the asking price of barley sold for beer. And climate scientists predict it will only get worse for the region, with statewide temperatures rising 4° to 5° Fahrenheit by 2055. Enlarge / No barley, no beer: A beer brewer pulls malted barley from the mash tun at Wynwood Brewing Company in Miami, Florida. Barley is a fairly temperate crop, predominantly grown in cooler regions like the Northern Great Plains, North Central Europe, Australia, and the Asian steppe. So it's likely that barley farmers can adapt to gradual changes in the climateat least that's the ""somewhat heroic assumption"" Davis et al. made in their study. Farmers could selectively breed their crops, or tweak them genetically, to develop more drought-resistant barley, for instance. They could also change their farming practices to increase yields in warmer conditions. That's why the researchers focused on the most extreme years for their study, with shifts so severe that it's unlikely farmers would be able to adapt fast enough. According to Davis, under the most-favorable scenario they modeled, where the world avoids two degrees of warming (an increasingly unlikely scenario), roughly ten percent of those years will be extreme by the end of the 21st century. Under the worst-case scenario, it will be roughly every other year. Extreme heat and drought would ""pretty much become the norm,"" he says. To the extreme The researchers took those extreme climate events and modeled their impact on barley yields in 23 world regions. Then they studied the effect of the resulting barley shortages on the supply and price of beer in each region, under several different scenarios. They concluded that the largest barley growing regions would experience declines in crop yields of 3 to 17 percent, depending on the severity of the conditions. Beer prices would double on average, and consumption would decrease by between 4 percent and 16 percent in the best and worst case scenarios, respectively. Naturally, there would be regional variations. Price swings are tied to the ability and willingness of consumers to pay more for beer, or, alternatively, to drink less of it, thereby decreasing consumption, per Davis. Beer is already expensive in Australia and Japan, for instance, so beer drinkers there wouldn't feel the brunt of the sticker shock quite so much as other regions, like Belgium, Germany, or the Czech Republic. In Ireland, Davis estimates that people could pay an extra $20 per six pack. ""Not having a cool pint at the end of an increasingly common hot day just adds insult to injury."" It's difficult to say whether barley shortages will affect craft brewers or big commercial brewers like Coors more, according to Davis. One could argue that fans of craft beers already are sufficiently affluent to afford more expensive beers, and thus might be more willing to pay even higher prices during a shortage. Coors' customers might be less willing. Then again, Coors has the market dominance to be able to get good barley even in shortage years, with large enough profit margins to ride out the lean times. A shortage of beer might not strike you as the most pressing life-or-death impact of global climate change, given the rising sea levels, stronger hurricanes, and worsening wildfires that have been making headlines of late. But most people rarely stop to consider all the little ways a warmer climate will impact their day-to-day lives. ""In an affluent country like the United States, people might not be so concerned if their bread gets 10 to 25 cents more expensive,"" says Davis. ""It could be that luxury goods are actually more visible, in terms of the impact of climate change on affluent consumers. There is definitely a cross-cultural appeal to beer, and not having a cool pint at the end of an increasingly common hot day just adds insult to injury.""

BEN SHPIGEL,"Of course, now he misses in the snow, muttered Raiders fans everywhere. Vinatieri missed an extra point later, leaving the Colts 11 points behind, all hope of a comeback dissolved.
The Chiefs defense, suspect all season, sacked Andrew Luck three times and held Marlon Mack, who last week blasted the Houston Texans for a franchise-record 148 rushing yards, to all of 46. The Colts played the opening quarter as if blindfolded: nine offensive plays, three punts. Against the Chiefs, who had more passing touchdowns (50) this season than punts (45), there may be no worse sin than empty possessions.
On his first series, Mahomes took Indianapolis apart for 90 yards in five plays, capped by a 10-yard scamper by Damien Williams, who finished with 129 yards on 25 carries. Given the ball again just 27 seconds later, the Chiefs went 70 yards, the majority coming on one play: Hills 36-yard reverse for a touchdown.
Before Luck completed a pass, Kansas City led by 17-0. With misdirection, precision and, at times, brute force, the Chiefs asserted themselves in a way the Colts hadnt encountered: Not once during a three-month surge from 1-5 to 10-6 did Indianapolis face a top-five offense.
The Chiefs are a top-one offense. Mahomes is a top-one quarterback. The chants of M.V.P. reverberated loud and long. So many times over the years, Kansas City confronted a quarterback deficit in the playoffs. John Elway and Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Ben Roethlisberger all foiled the Chiefs.
Already they have advanced deeper than any predecessor since Joe Montana helmed the team 25 years ago. They know how fleeting this moment can be, and if they win next Sunday, surpassing the teams of Montana and Trent Green and Alex Smith and all the others, Mahomes will add to his growing legend to stories that delighted fans will pass down, stories that may seem apocryphal, but are not.","The Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes (15) dissected the Colts’ defense, throwing for 278 yards.

Andrew Freedman,"The wildfires raging across Southern California have scorched tens of thousands of acres of land, destroyed hundreds of homes, and disrupted countless lives. While the scenes of flames screaming up hillsides, and smoke trailing hundreds of miles out over the Pacific are dramatic, they're not unprecedented. In fact, they're not even that rare. However, they are likely to be more damaging in the future, and more common in certain parts of California and the American West in general, thanks to climate change and other factors. SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying Wildfires, particularly during the fall, are endemic to California. In Southern California, the biggest blazes tend to flare up when the dry, warm Santa Ana winds blow, sometimes unceasingly for days on end. This week, for example, the Santa Ana wind event began on Monday, and is not forecast to stop until Friday night. Flames from a wildfire leap above traffic on Highway 101 north of Ventura, Calif., on Dec. 6, 2017. Image: Noah Berger/AP/REX/Shutterstock Much of the time during these events Southern California gets lucky, and there are no major blazes to speak of. It's not one of those years. This year is proving to be California's worst wildfire season on record. In October, more than 40 were killed and at least 10,000 homes lost when fires tore through Sonoma and Napa Counties, devastating the community of Santa Rosa, in particular. Known as ""El Diablo"" winds in this area, the offshore airflow was instrumental in propelling the wildfires faster than people could get out of the way, let alone allow firefighters to squelch the flames. Santa Ana winds result from a particular weather pattern featuring a high pressure area anchored over the Great Basin, and a low pressure area southwest of California, over the Pacific Ocean. The air pressure contrast between these two systems results in a funneling of air from east to west. As the air descends from the higher elevations toward the coast, it warms and dries, leading to extremely low humidity. These background conditions set the scene for a major fire, provided there's a spark. This year, there's been added fire risk from repeated heat waves that have sent temperatures soaring into the triple-digits as late as October, further drying out vegetation that is now serving as fuel for the fires. “It’s the coincidence of an ignition,"" that determines whether a Santa Ana event will lead to major fires, said Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, in an interview. ""And the two big causes of ignitions during Santa Ana wind events are power lines that blow down from the strong winds and arson."" The winds themselves can initiate a fire by downing power lines, something suspected in the fires that affected Northern California in October. Power outages preceded the Thomas Fire in Ventura on Tuesday, as well. Upper level winds showing the huge area of high pressure, or ""ridge,"" in the jet stream across the West, highlighted with the blue box. Image: earth.nullschool.net Importantly, the winds also make the fires nearly impossible to contain, blowing hot embers well ahead of the fire line, allowing blazes to hop across 10-lane highways with unsettling ease. The National Weather Service has been warning of the likelihood for ""extreme fire behavior"" with any fire that starts during this long-lasting wind event, going as far as designating the fire danger as ""extremely critical"" in the Los Angeles area. Once the fires get going, they can create their own weather, sucking in air from surrounding areas and lofting it upwards, promoting further fire growth and unpredictable behavior. Longer term trends This week, the high pressure area, or ""ridge"" in the jet stream, is extremely pronounced, part of a tendency toward more extreme weather patterns across the country. Recent studies indicate there may be connections between altered weather patterns, which are favoring drier conditions in California, and climate change. Last summer was the state's hottest on record, following a wet winter, which in turn followed the worst drought in modern California history. These episodes of weather whiplash have left the Golden State's trees stressed, making them more susceptible to toppling over from strong winds. Multiple studies have found that long-term climate change, which is mainly due to human emissions of greenhouse gases, is raising the risk of large wildfires in the Western U.S. However, according to the USGS' Keeley, this doesn't apply to the lower elevations of southern California. His research has shown that the warming climate is leading to more frequent and larger fires in Northern California, particularly in high elevation forests, he said. There are broader, non-climate forces at work, too. Population growth is placing more people in harms' way, including by building in areas at the so-called wildland-urban interface, or WUI, where areas that traditionally burn as part of their natural ecology butt up against homes and businesses. In short, urban sprawl is not helping solve our wildfire problem. Keeley emphasized this point, saying that it's not just climate change, but global change that will alter wildfire severity and risk going forward. Wildfires are likely to have more catastrophic human impacts due to population growth along with climate change, he said. California statewide average temperatures for June through Nov. 2017. Image: noaa/ncei. For example, he cited a 1964 wildfire that burned almost the exact same area as the deadly Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa. However, back then, the blaze caused no fatalities and only destroyed about two-dozen homes. Since that fire, though, he said the population in that area grew fivefold. “We need to be thinking about all the global changes that are taking place,” Keeley said. In the near-term, though, the Santa Ana winds are forecast to increase on Wednesday night, and may hit 70 miles per hour in some spots of Southern California on Thursday. In other words, this latest round of fires, which is a sign of the state's heritage and future challenge in a warming world, may yet grow worse.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":""These fires may be a glimpse into SoCal's future under climate change."",""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-UjmGCjSM8A3WRuM-dU4wz3FFDc=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F12%2F2c93672f-2bfe-c7a0%2Fthumb%2…",2017-12-06T22:40:04Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",The combustible mix behind Southern California's terrifying wildfires,http://mashable.com/2017/12/06/causes-of-southern-california-terrifying-wildfires-climate-change/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/44W3cplqc12pcASZtA9Xo3fYuNs=/1200x630/2017%2F12%2F06%2F0c%2Ff6cdf617cb964daf939a45ff2bdc5e85.b9168.jpg,mashable,Mashable,drought,1
Mark Kaufman,"Ash is once again raining down upon California's Bay area, as the parched land to the north ignites. Not eight months after firestorms ravaged Northern California wine country, the flames have returned to the region. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, reports that the County Fire started at around 2:00 p.m. on June 30, and as of the morning of July 1, had rapidly spread to 16,500 acres. The agency says 110 fire trucks have been deployed to the Yolo County area, which abuts California's famed Napa wine valley. Yolo itself is also rich in vineyards and tasting rooms. SEE ALSO: A landmark climate change ruling could go up in smoke after Justice Kennedy retires Both of these areas typically have hot, dry summers. Even so, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Drought Monitor shows these regions are experiencing ""abnormally dry"" conditions. Meaningful rains aren't expected during the summer, and lacking winter rains left the region with about 30 percent less rainfall than usual, as of late June. These parched lands, combined with hot temperatures and wind, fueled the County Fire, as well as others to the north, like the Pawnee Fire. In October 2017, historic fires in and around the wine country burned down over 8,000 structures, killing 44 people. These flames were helped by "" diablo winds "" reaching 79 miles per hour and vegetation that had been turned to tinder, after being dried out by the hottest California summer on record. More extreme wildfires are an expected part of California's future, as scientists say climate change has begun to lock into a cycle where ""climate whiplash"" is the norm. Under these conditions, the state will alternate between years of extreme drought followed by deluges of rain. And during times of extended drought, more wildfire is expected. Already, the pattern appears to have emerged. From 2012 to 2016, the state experienced its worst drought on record, and likely worst in centuries more. This was followed by a winter deluge, one of the wettest in the state's history.","Ash is once again raining down upon California's Bay area, as the parched land to the north ignites.

Andrew Freedman,"It's 2018. Donald Trump is president of the U.S., Elon Musk will soon send a sports car into space aboard a massive rocket, and Cape Town, South Africa, will run out of water in 79 days. Triggered by an intense drought, officials in Cape Town are poised to turn off the taps to about 3.2 million people on or around April 12. Given seasonal rainfall patterns, it's doubtful to impossible to avoid this once-unthinkable situation, since the region is in the midst of its typical dry season and unlikely to get much rain before then. SEE ALSO: These visualizations make disturbing 2017 temperature milestone look like modern art The drought in Cape Town began in 2015 and has refused to yield. It's brought the community closer and closer to ""Day Zero,"" which is the point when the water in the reservoirs no longer can provide safe drinking water. That date has been pegged as April 12, recently revised from April 21, according to the Western Cape Water Supply District. The predicament the city finds itself in is ironic, since the municipal government has been at the forefront of the movement for global cities to take a leading role in the fight against climate change. The city has sought to cut its emissions of global warming pollutants, such as carbon dioxide. But now the region finds itself in the grips of a withering drought that may be exacerbated by climate change, forcing city and regional agencies to take draconian actions to curb water use. Once water in the reservoirs falls below a certain level, residents won't have running tap water or water to flush their toilets, businesses and schools may be forced to close, and other significant disruptions will take place. According to meteorologist Bob Henson at Weather Underground, last ditch efforts to avoid Day Zero could include accessing groundwater supplies, which would involve drilling deep wells, and constructing portable desalination plants that convert salt water to fresh water. The six dams supplying Cape Town with water stood at just 27 percent of capacity as of Jan. 24., according to the Western Cape Water Supply District. A media statement issued by the district said Cape Town residents are still using too much water when compared to the restrictions in place. Cape Town is located in an area that has a Mediterranean climate, with a wet season lasting from about June through September, when a series of cold fronts and low pressure systems strafe the region with rain and wind. From October to April, during the region's summer months, the weather systems tend to spin up to the south of South Africa, leaving an area of high pressure in control that keeps much of the country dry. Climate projections show that droughts like this ongoing one are likely to become more common as the Earth warms in response to higher amounts of greenhouse gases in the air. In the case of South Africa, climate models project that areas of tranquil high pressure will become more common, sapping the atmosphere of moisture and lift needed to produce rainfall. Bare sand and dried tree trunks standing out at Theewaterskloof Dam, near Villiersdorp, South Africa. Image: Roger bosch/AFP/Getty Images Climate models project continued year-to-year variability in rainfall in Cape Town, with a net decrease in precipitation over time. ""Not a permanent drought. Dry years and wet years. And “moderate” years in between. But the chance of dry years increases as we go towards the end of the century,"" wrote Piotr Wolski, a hydroclimatologist at the University of Cape Town. ""And the chance of wet years decreases as we go towards the end of the century. That’s our New Normal, at least on the rainfall side."" Wolski analyzed rainfall data for the areas near Cape Town's dams and found that the ongoing drought, which began in 2015, has a return period of about 311 years. This figure shows a trend in rainfall in the WCWSS region over the last 84 years. That trend is towards lower rainfall. Image: Piotr wolski He found that there has been a trend toward declining rainfall in Cape Town during the past 84 years, which is increasing the odds of severe droughts. This is in keeping with other climate data from elsewhere in the world that shows that climate change intensifies hydrological extremes, such as droughts, by raising temperatures and evaporation rates. ""Simply, if that trend was not there, a drought of [the] magnitude experienced in 2017 would be much less likely. Or, to put it in another way, if that trend was not there, then the 2017 drought would likely be much less severe,"" Wolski wrote on his blog.","It's 2018.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","As the U.S. grapples with one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, Australia is getting a head start on what looks to be an equally brutal year of bushfires. Since early August—wintertime in the southern hemisphere— hundreds of bushfires have flared up in the Australian provinces of Queensland and New South Wales, prompting some local authorities to declare bushfire season open more than a month ahead of schedule. This freak fire lashing has experts extremely worried for what lies ahead as Australia transitions into spring and then summer. “We’re dreading what the rest of the season holds for us,” former New South Wales Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Greg Mullins told Earther. Fueling the flames is a drought that’s been described as the worst in living memory. Last winter was Australia’s hottest on record and the driest since 2002, and for large swaths of eastern and southern Australia, there’s been little rain to slake the thirst since. About 60 percent of Queensland is currently in drought. So is 100 percent of New South Wales, a province that produces a quarter of the nation’s crops. Many of its fields are looking frighteningly brown. This winter has also been unusually warm, and that combination of heat and drought is causing landscapes to light up like a tinderbox when something provides the spark. For the most remote fires, the spark is often lightning, but a large number of the blazes are being started by humans as well. Mullins said farmers often use small, contained fires to burn off weeds or undergrowth outside of fire season, but some of those burns have gotten out of hand this winter. Fire managers, who typically use the winter to conduct prescribed burns that reduce fire fuel, are grappling with a similar issue because of the parched conditions. “At least some of the fires in New South Wales originated as hazard reduction burns that got out of control because it was so flammable,” Lesley Hughes, an ecologist with the Australian Climate Council, told Earther. None of this bodes for the months ahead, especially with the eastern Pacific tipping into an El Niño state, something that normally delivers warmer, drier weather to southern Australia. “We’re looking down the barrel at this insane fire season,” University of Tasmania fire ecologist David Bowman told Earther. “It’s difficult to exaggerate just how extreme the whole thing is.” Bowman, Hughes, and Mullins all pointed to climate change as the key driver of longer, more intense fire seasons in Australia, like the one this year’s lining up to be. A 2015 report by the Australia Climate Council reached a similar conclusion, noting that climate change is upping the likelihood of fire weather by increasing the frequency of heat waves and, in southern Australia, exacerbating drought. For Mullins, who’s been fighting bushfires since the early 1970s and whose father was a firefighter for over 60 years before him, decades of life experience tell him how profoundly the fire season has changed. He recalled how the onset of dangerous fire weather used to be far more predictable. Today, it’s not only harder to say when a fire outbreak will occur, but the worst fires are on a scale nobody’s prepared to fight. “It’s the new normal,” Mullins said. “We can’t handle it.”","As the U.S. grapples with one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, Australia is getting a head start on what looks to be an equally brutal year of bushfires.

LEAH C. STOKES,"We say the extreme rain caused this disaster. We say it was the fire. And we say that multiple years of drought didn’t help. But what caused the rain, the fire and the drought? There is a clear climate signature in the disaster in Santa Barbara. We know that climate change is making California’s extreme rainfall events more frequent. We know it’s worsening our fires. We know that it contributed substantially to the latest drought. There are simpler stories we could tell. Stories with more proximate causes: Those people bought in dangerous places. Those people should have left their homes. Those people are somehow to blame. These events are normal. These things just happen there. But these simple stories mask a larger truth. How many times do we need to hear adjectives in their superlative form before we spot a pattern: largest, rainiest, driest, deadliest? Records, by their nature, are not meant to be set annually. And yet that’s what is happening. The costliest year for natural disasters in the United States was 2017. One of the longest and most severe droughts in California history concluded for most parts of the state in 2017. The five warmest years on record have all occurred since 2006, with 2017 expected to be one of the warmest yet again. I have researched climate change policy for over a decade now. For a long time, we assumed that climate policy was stalled because it was a problem for the future. Or it would affect other people. Poorer people. Animals. Ecosystems. We assumed those parts of the world were separate from us. That we were somehow insulated. I didn’t expect to see it in my own backyard so soon. Climate change devastated ecosystems, species and neighborhoods in Houston and much of struggling Puerto Rico last year. Now climate change has ravaged one of the wealthiest ZIP codes in the country. We know now that even the richest among us is not insulated. These extreme events are getting worse. But when I read the news after each fresh disaster, I rarely see a mention of climate change. Whether it’s coverage of a fire in my backyard or a powerful hurricane in the Caribbean, this bigger story is usually missing. To say that it is too soon to talk about the causes of a crisis is wrongheaded. We must connect the dots. Climate change helped cost my friends’ businesses’ revenue. Climate change helped put my community in chaos for weeks. Climate change paved the way for lost lives next door. If climate victims here and across the globe understood that carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels played a role in their losses, perhaps they would rise up to demand policy changes. We know this could happen because research from the political scientist Regina Bateson, now a congressional candidate in California, shows that being a crime victim can spur people into activism. Perhaps some of the people affected by the fires in California, the hurricanes in Puerto Rico and Texas, and the drought in the Dakotas will be similarly motivated. Maybe some of these climate change victims will become the climate policy champions we sorely need. It is never too soon after one of these disasters to speak truth about climate change’s role. If anything, it is too late. If we do not name the problem, we cannot hope to solve it. For my community, as much as yours, I hope we will.

Mark Kaufman,"Nearly 40 large wildfires now burn across the United States. Blazes are expected this time of year, with hot air, dry land, and gusty winds stoking big fires throughout the western U.S. But today, twice as much land is burned than in the early 1980s, when the U.S. Forest Service started keeping good fire records each year. As hotter climes and increased drought parch the land, this means that modern wildland firefighters are exposed to more flames than they have been since record keeping began. SEE ALSO: California's wine country fire has been brewing for years These firefighters are extremely well-trained, but sometimes the worst happens: Flames surround fire crews and force them to take cover under foil-like tents, called emergency fire shelters. Here, they wait for the scorching flames to pass overhead. Although deploying this last-ditch option is rare, the results can be tragic. Five summers ago, 19 firefighters, battling flames in an Arizona area that had experienced extreme drought, perished inside their fire shelters. For this reason, the Forest Service has devised improved shelters over time, and this fire season, they've introduced robust prototypes, designed by NASA. Scientists at the space agency, unsettled by the deaths of the 19 firefighters in 2013, decided to employ an inflatable heat-shield technology — meant to withstand the up to 5,000-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures spacecraft experience when falling through the atmosphere — to create more robust fire shelters. In total, firefighters and fire equipment operators are now carrying around 40 of these prototypes into fire territory, in areas all over the country. An artist's rendering of NASA's inflatable heat shield technology. Image: NASA In laboratory tests, where researches shot fire at the shelters, the results show the NASA tents — which expand like a fluffy blanket when exposed to hot temperatures — can protect firefighters against deadly heat for considerably longer than the current shelters, designed in 2002. ""It is a marked improvement,"" Tony Petrilli, the Forest Service's Fire Shelter Review Leader, said in an interview. The very first fire shelters, from decades ago, gave the firefighters inside about 12 seconds of lab-tested ""survivability,"" said Petrilli. The current shelters offer 54 seconds of survivability. And NASA's prototypes lasted for about 90 seconds. ""It's a very extreme test, but it does not necessarily reflect the most extreme fire in wild settings,"" noted Petrilli. Fire shelter prototypes being prepared for outdoor testing in an Alberta, Canada forest. Image: U.S. Forest Service/Ian Grob But before the NASA shelters can replace the current shelters, Petrilli needs to ensure that they hold up in the real world, as the bundled and folded tents are lugged through rough terrain and tossed around. ""The biggest job the shelters have to withstand is being carried around,"" said Petrilli. The NASA fire shelters, like all fire shelters, must be pretty light, weighing in at around four pounds. Wildland firefighters are already burdened with heavy packs, and can't take on much more baggage. ""Forty-five or 50 pounds is not unusual,"" said Petrilli. ""The vast majority of firefighters don’t want to carry more weight."" This makes the NASA prototypes particularly well-suited for the task. The thin fabric is embedded with pepper-like bits of graphite. When exposed to heat, this graphite makes the fiberglass insulation expand — so the material only gets bigger when exposed to scorching temperatures. Still, said Petrilli, ""There’s no guarantee of survivability in even the biggest, bulkiest shelters."" Wildland firefighters work in the smoky Boise National Forest in 2016. Image: Forest Service/Kari Greer The material can't withstand long periods of direct contact with flames (not much can). Before deploying the shelters, firefighters are trained to seek out an area where little fire will burn on the tents, such as ground with scarce vegetation. The idea is for the fire to burn around or near the tents — which still produces sizzling, deadly heat — but not directly on the tents, said Petrilli. Even the earliest fire shelter, though inferior in many ways to NASA's technology, has already proven quite effective in protecting professionals combating wild flames. ""That old-style shelter saved hundreds and hundreds of lives,"" said Petrilli. NASA's formidable heat shields have protected astronauts and spacecraft from deadly heat for decades. Perhaps they'll be equally effective at shielding firefighters.","Nearly 40 large wildfires now burn across the United States.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","On Tuesday, NOAA and NASA released their much-anticipated analyses of global climate trends for 2018. As we expected, the agencies confirmed it was the fourth-warmest year on record for planet Earth. But the reports also highlighted just how striking a year it was for the U.S. specifically, with most of the country feeling the heat and various regions experiencing either extreme rainfall or drought.
Across the world, global temperatures were 1.42-1.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the long-term average, placing 2018 behind 2016, 2017, and 2015 as the fourth warmest on record. The U.S.-specific numbers closely mirror the planetary heat wave: Overall, temperatures were about 1.5 degrees higher than the 20th-century average according to NOAA, making it Americas 14th-warmest year. With the exception of the northern Great Plains, which had a relatively average year, most regions of the countryparticularly the West, Southwest, and Southeastwere warm.
 Pockets of the Mid-Atlantic and Southwest saw their warmest year on record when it came to overnight low temperatures, and most of the country saw overnight low temperatures that far exceeded the 20th-century average. Nights, in other words, are getting uncomfortably sweaty for many Americans.

This is one of the most significant and emergent themes in the 21st century, Deke Arndt, chief of the climate monitoring branch for NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information, told reporters on a press call, adding that considering just morning-time low temperatures, the U.S. had its 7th-warmest year on record. This, Arndt explained, is what wed expect in a warming world, where the shrinking of the so-called atmospheric boundary layer at night amplifies warming.
Heat aside, there were also some notable patterns when it came to rainfall or a lack thereof. It was the third-wettest year on record for the country, but the rain didnt fall evenly. In fact, it was concentrated like a bullseye over the Mid-Atlantic, with nine states along the Appalachiansfrom Tennessee to Massachusettsexperiencing their wettest year on record, according to Arndt.
The southwestern U.S. around Four Corners, meanwhile, was desperately thirsty. Most of Utah and Arizona, along with large portions of Colorado and New Mexico, experienced drought conditions all year, continuing what Ardnt described as an entrenched and very intense dry spell that began ramping up in the late 1990s.
The fingerprints of climate change can be seen across this wet-dry seesaw. On the wetter side, a warmer atmosphere can hold and dump more water vapor, and climate scientists predict an uptick in rainfall intensity and total rainfall the Northeastern U.S. as a result. Ardnt called 2018 an exclamation point on a trend were seeing toward more big rain, particularly in the Eastern U.S.
The link between the drought out West and our warming world is a bit more subtle: As Gavin Schmidt, director of NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies, explained on the press call, current precipitation levels arent that unusual when considering the last few thousand years of history. But the drying of the soilwhich impacts not only our crops, but how prone landscapes are to catching fireis the result of both reduced precipitation and warmer temperatures, the latter of which is attributable to increased greenhouse gases, Schmidt said.
The bottom line? Climate change is real, and its effects are coming home to roost. The most sobering statistic from the new report makes that clear: Americans lost $91 billion to weather and climate disasters last year, the fourth-largest total since 1980. While the agencies didnt quantify how much of those losses was attributable directly to a climate change versus where and how we choose to live, theres ample evidence some of these disasters are being amplified in a warming world.
The report comes on the heels of a State of the Union address in which President Trump touted American oil and natural gas production, while failing to mention climate change.","On Tuesday, NOAA and NASA released their much-anticipated analyses of global climate trends for 2018.

""In California, persistent heat and dryness increased fire danger,"" wrote the U.S. Drought Monitor on July 24, the day after the Carr fire began. In particular, the area around Redding is experiencing conditions worse than ""abnormally dry,"" and is now listed as experiencing ""moderate drought."" Much of the entire heat-stricken Northern Hemisphere has recently experienced record heat waves or above-average summer temperatures. Redding could be experiencing its warmest July on record, according to KRCR News meteorologist Rob Elvington. Redding's scorching 2018 summer isn't an anomaly. Each of the city's last June-July average temperatures for the last five years have been among the five hottest on record, noted Elvington. These conditions have helped further dry out the land and spawn a fire that leapt over the Sacramento River last week. Those conditions also stoked a towering vortex that propelled the Carr Fire's own violent weather system. ""This is a large and dangerous plume dominated fire in which spreading is not driven by the wind, but rather the fire itself,"" the National Weather Service wrote over the weekend.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","It’s not every day we hear Americans are doing an okay job on the conservation front, but that appears to be the case when it comes to water usage. A new U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) report finds U.S. water consumption is at its lowest level in more than 45 years. Americans withdrew 322 billion gallons of water a day in 2015, down from 354 billion gallons per day in 2010. It’s the continuation of a “sharp but steady” downward trend that’s been evident since 2005 according to USGS, which tracks American water usage every five years. That’s welcome news considering the water woes many Americans out West have faced due to persistent drought —a problem climate change will only exacerbate. The dip in water use from 2010 to 2015 was driven by a nearly 20 percent drop in consumption by power plants, which account for about 40 percent of all American water usage. That can be attributed to the use of newer, more efficient water-based cooling systems, an increase in the use of dry cooling towers, and the shuttering of aging coal plants with inefficient water usage, per the report. But individual consumers also played a role. Public supply water withdrawals—for residences, public pools, parks, commercial spaces and more—account for 12 percent of American water usage. This consumption was down in 2015, too, with the average per-capita water use dropping from 88 to 82 gallons per day. Hearteningly, the public supply trend was driven largely by declines in water use in California and Texas, two states with high water consumption that have been hit by serious drought in recent years. In California, Governor Jerry Brown imposed mandatory water restrictions in 2015, while in Texas, the voluntary efforts of utility companies to conserve water seem to be paying off. The report notes that San Antonio’s water system reduced its per capita usage 42 percent “simply by focusing on education, outreach, and regulations.” More broadly, a smorgasbord of policies have helped Americans save water across the country, including the National Energy Policy Act of 1992, which established efficiency standards for toilets, faucets, shower heads and more, and EPA WaterSense, a program that certifies consumer products as water efficient. There’s no such thing as a simple success story, though. As Kathie Dello, Associate Director of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute pointed out to Earther, the decline in water usage has actually been a challenge for some utilities, which have had to raise their rates in order to keep revenues up. Then there’s climate change. As the EPA’s now-defunct ( RIP ) page on water and climate states, “climate change is likely to increase water demand while shrinking water supplies.” We’ll see this in South Florida, where rising sea levels are causing surface aquifers to become tainted with salt, a problem that’s only going to get worse. Meanwhile in the South and West, already drought-prone areas are likely to become hotter and drier while reservoir-replenishing snowpack diminishes. “The delicate conversation between conservation and consumption isn’t going away, especially with declining western snowpack and limited storage,” Dello said.

Mark Kaufman,"When elephants fall into deep holes, they often get trapped. Unfortunately, in drought-ridden Kenya, nomadic ranchers frequently have to dig deep holes to find water for both themselves and their livestock. And at night, thirsty elephants seek out these wells. The adults, with great long trunks, have little problem reaching the water, but the junior, inexperienced elephants can tumble in. If the animals can't be pulled out, the elephants are forced to abandon their young. SEE ALSO: Rhino experts aren’t banking on unproven IVF technology to rescue threatened species Over a dozen of these abandoned elephants now live at the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary, being taken on daily walks into the woods and fed milk with bottles. It's a unique form of conservation, where the local Samburu people — a semi-nomadic pastoralist group — collectively owns, manages, and profits from tourists that visit the 3,400-acre property. Caring for the young elephants — who grow to be the largest land animals on Earth — is a dramatic departure for the Samburu, who once feared the giant, intelligent animals. ""A typical Samburu has never been close to the elephants,"" Sammy Lemoonga, the Harvard-educated head of the sanctuary who was raised as a nomadic rancher, said in an interview. Historically, the Samburu stayed away from the elephants to avoid conflict. People and elephants have a long history that includes people killing elephants, and sometimes, elephants trampling people, Lemoonga said. Conservation International, an environmental organization that promotes biodiversity, has captured footage of the Samburu raising orphaned elephants, thirsty elephants seeking out well water, and a lone African lioness capturing a wildebeest outside the sanctuary. A short-documentary called My Africa, released Monday and narrated by Academy Award-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o, along with a virtual reality experience, illustrates the sanctuary's unexpected conservation story. Rescuing elephants may turn out to be profitable for the Samburu. Presently, the eco-tourism industry in Kenya is doing quite well, Richard Vigne, director of the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya where the last male northern white rhino recently succumbed to old age and illness, said in an interview. Many wildlife conservancies, like Ol Pejeta, rely heavily on tourism to sustain themselves — and protect their wildlife. There is already a well-established orphan elephant program in Kenya, the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, which has reintroduced some 200 elephants back into the wild, showing it can be done. Vigne said if the two-year-old Reteti Elephant Sanctuary can successfully prepare abandoned elephants for the wild — while also generating money for conservation — it could prove to be a positive endeavor. It's also likely that more baby elephants will be abandoned in the area, and the culprit is severe drought. ""The majority of elephant and human-wildlife conflict happens when there’s a drought,"" said Lemoonga, referring to the elephants seeking deep holes, dug to find water during severe droughts. Although a deluge of rain hit Kenya in April, the country has been mired in a drought for around four years. In February 2017, the Kenyan government declared a national drought emergency. Generally, elephants in this part of Kenya aren't poached for their tusks, Lemoonga said, because people have a livelihood in ranching. Of the 14 orphaned elephants at the sanctuary, 13 were orphaned after falling into the primitive wells, not because their mothers were killed. Extreme droughts are likely to be a continuing story in Kenya, and the greater Horn of Africa. ""What we’ve seen for the past several decades is a decline in rainfall especially during the longer rainy season,"" Jessica Tierney, associate professor in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Arizona, said in an interview. Tierney published a study on past and future rainfall in the region in 2015. ""In fact, that decline has been more severe than at any time in the last 1,000 years,"" she said. ""So, that raises some concern in terms of what the future holds for rainfall in the Horn of Africa."" The Samburu are preparing for more abandoned elephants, whether they're rescued from wells or left alone after poachers kill their mothers. The Samburu are also building more housing for guests, which at $800 a night per bed, ""brings in plenty of money,"" said Lemoonga. Samburu keepers bottle-feeding rescued elephants. Image: Ami Vitale This doesn't just support elephants, which are fed milk infused with vitamins and other nutrients. It also supports the Samburu themselves with medical care, scholarships, and infrastructure. Although the elephants are an attractive eco-tourism opportunity, the Samburu won't keep the animals. They've developed a plan to ""rewild"" the elephants, Lemoonga said. At age four or five, they will be permanently brought out of their stables and brought to a rewilding site in the sanctuary, where they'll be weaned off their bottles and increasingly made to rely upon natural vegetation. The young elephants are already walked through their natural environs each day and fed some natural food, in preparation for their future release. At the Samburu sanctuary, wild African animals that happen to pass through — giraffes, bison, and elephants — all realize they're safe, even though there's no fence or boundaries distinguishing the true wilderness from the sanctuary, said Lemoonga. ""When you see wild elephants in the sanctuary they're very calm and friendly,"" he said. ""Same with the giraffes."" This is a new experience for both the elephants and the Samburu people, two groups who once actively avoided each other. Today, as water becomes increasingly scarce, they may come to depend on one another ever more.","When elephants fall into deep holes, they often get trapped.

NICHOLAS KRISTOF,"A year ago in Madagascar, I met a family ready to marry off a 10-year-old girl, Fombasoa, because of a drought linked to climate change. And there are increasing reports that poverty linked to climate change is leading to child marriage in Malawi, Mozambique and other countries. In Kutubdia, climate change is not the only issue. The seas are rising, but in addition, Kutubdia itself seems to be sinking. The upshot is that the island’s shoreline has retreated by about a kilometer since the 1960s, farmers say. Even when land is mostly dry, occasional high tides or storm surges bring in saltwater that poisons the rice paddies. Thousands of climate refugees have already fled Kutubdia and formed their own neighborhood in the mainland Bangladeshi city of Cox’s Bazaar. A similar injustice is apparent in many poor countries. “Climate change contributes to conflict,” noted Neal Keny-Guyer, the C.E.O. of Mercy Corps, the aid group. He observed that a drier climate is widely believed to have caused agricultural failures, tensions and migrations that played a role in the Syrian civil war, the Darfur genocide and the civil war in northeastern Nigeria. Photo Mokbul Ahmed, standing on a Kutubdia beach fortified by concrete blocks, points to where he had lived and farmed. Credit Thomas Nybo/Redux, for Unicef Aside from reducing carbon emissions, Keny-Guyer said, Western countries can do much more to build resilience in poor countries. That can include supporting drought-resistant or saltwater-resistant crops, and offering micro-insurance to farmers and herdsmen so that a drought does not devastate them. Mercy Corps is now developing such micro-insurance. The evidence of climate change is increasingly sobering, with the last four years also the hottest four years on record since modern record-keeping began in the 1880s. We’re also coming to understand that climate change may wreak havoc, changing ocean currents, killing coral reefs and nurturing feedback loops that accelerate the warming. It turns out that 99 percent of green sea turtles hatched in the northern Great Barrier Reef are now female, because their sex is determined by temperature. Most of the villagers I spoke to both in Madagascar and in Bangladesh had never heard of President Trump. But the outlook for their descendants may depend on the actions he takes — and his withdrawal from the Paris climate accord is an unhelpful surrender of American leadership. Americans were recently horrified by a viral video of a starving polar bear, which may or may not be linked to climate change. Let’s hope we can be just as indignant about the impact of climate change on children like Munni.

JENNIFER MEDINA and SARAH MERVOSH,"The fires are fueled by extreme heat and parched vegetation from years of drought. And firefighters have repeatedly been vexed by the soaring temperatures and rugged terrain of the current fires. Scientists say climate change is a central factor in creating the atmospheric ingredients that make wildfires like California’s more extreme. Warmer global temperatures, driven by the greenhouse gases emitted from man-made activity like burning coal and driving cars, has led to droughts as well as more intense heat waves that last longer. The result: increasingly intense fire seasons that start earlier and last longer. “You combine drought and heat, you get record wildfires. It’s not rocket science,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said it is still not possible to quantify the role that climate change plays versus other factors from more housing developments to the way forests are managed. But, Mr. Wehner said, “It’s fair to say that there is a human influence, and it’s not small.” The Mendocino Complex Fire is a combination of two fires that ignited a few miles apart, Ms. Tolmachoff said. In instances where multiple blazes are close enough together and affect the same area, she said, officials consider them one fire, called a complex. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, which started on July 27 and was 34 percent contained as of early Tuesday. It has so far destroyed 143 structures, including 75 residences. Despite its size, no one has died in the Mendocino Complex Fire, Ms. Tolmachoff said. Of the top 20 largest wildfires in California, about half have come in the last decade, according to Cal Fire. “That says a lot about the way things are changing in California,” Ms. Tolmachoff said.","Two fires have combined in Northern California to form the largest wildfire in state history. The Mendocino Complex has doubled in size in the past four days and now spans more than 283,000 acres.",2018-08-07T18:23:18Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Fires Grow to Largest in State History,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/us/california-fires-mendocino.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/08/us/08calfire-03/08calfire-03-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,drought,1
Tom McKay,"Wildfires in California have continued to ravage large portions of the state, with the Thomas fire in southern California now entering its 13th day and claiming over 267,500 acres of land, CNN reported. The wildfire is now the third-largest in California history and is just 40 percent contained, with over 8,400 firefighters and $110 million in resources deployed to fight it. Now-familiar scenes posted by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department and others this weekend showed Ventura and Santa Barbara counties descending into a nightmarish state, just as with a prior spate of wildfires elsewhere in California earlier this year. Ventura resident Patricia Rye told KEYT she had woken up in the middle of the night after her son-in-law arrived and did not have time to grab anything before the fire approached her building. “I didn’t have time to take anything,” Rye said. “My wallet, or any of my personal things. I literally left with the clothes on my back. If I had been thinking I would have got into my car, but I wasn’t thinking so my car was there.” Elsewhere, CNN reported, thousands of people were evacuated and animals at the Santa Barbara Zoo were loaded into cages in anticipation of a possible emergency. The Thomas fire could be on track to become the largest fire in recorded California history, the L.A. Times reported, potentially surpassing both the 2003 Cedar fire (273,000 acres) and the 1889 Santiago Canyon fire (300,000 acres). UCLA and U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist Jon Keeley told the paper that half of the largest wildfires in the state since 1861 have occurred in the last 15 years, with humans primarily to blame—both as a result of arson or accidental fires being started by them or due to persistent regional drought, which is linked to climate change. “We think that this fire, the Thomas fire, is likely very large in part not just because the Santa Ana wind event is long, but there was this very extreme drought between 2012 and 2014,” Keeley said. “... What extreme droughts do is they cause dieback of the vegetation,” he added. “Basically a canopy of the vegetation dies and oftentimes the entire plant dies. So you have lots of dead vegetation out on the landscape from the drought. And when the Santa Ana winds blow embers ahead of the fire front, they’ll ignite spot fires, but only if they land on dead vegetation.” Associate director of the Center for Environmental Journalism at the University of Colorado, Boulder Michael Kodas wrote in the L.A. Times that prior to 1995, the U.S. averaged one “mega-fire” of more than 100,000 acres a year. California now experiences one such fire a year on its own, while the U.S. averages nearly 10. Elsewhere in the paper, concerned readers urged fellow residents to stop building homes or developments in the wildland-urban border zones where the fires spread. [ CNN / L.A.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list? Tropical Depression Rosa made landfall in Baja California on Monday and is crawling into the Southwest, bringing with it the threat of flash floods from southern Arizona to Idaho. All told, 9 million people are under a flash flood watch or warning as of Tuesday morning Mountain Time as Rosa lumbers inland. The storm attained Category 4 status at its peak late last week, but has lost steam since then (at least in the wind department). It made landfall as a tropical storm in Baja California late last night and has since become Rosas lowly remnant low. But the winds were never the biggest concern for the Southwest. Instead, its the threat of torrential rain as the storm brings tropical moisture to an arid landscape. More than half an inch of rain has already fallen in and around Phoenix, making this one of the heaviest rain events to hit the city since 1990. Phoenix is already up to its seventh-wettest October on record despite it being just Oct. 2. With the heaviest bands of rain to come in the afternoon, the storm is likely to continue climbing the record books. All told, up to six inches of rain are expected in Arizonas mountains. That may not sound like a lot, especially after Florences recent deluge in the Carolinas, but the parched soil ups the risk of runoff. The scenic slot canyons and dry washes that cut across the desert landscape are disguised highways for water, waiting for rain events like this to send torrents rushing downstream. A recent drought has hardened soils even further, which could help accelerate the runoff process. Large portions of the Four Corners area are in exceptional or extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Rosas rain will certainly help alleviate that drought, but it will also exact a toll on the desert landscape and those living in it. Indeed, footage from Phoenixitself chock full of impervious pavementand the surrounding area shows that roads are already becoming inundated as the aforementioned dry washes fill up with frothing, muddy water. The Utah National Guard has already been activated according to CBS News, and we could see more resources mobilized as flooding continues to unfold. Its weird but not unprecedented for tropical systems to amble into the Southwest. Tropical Depression Storm Newton reached Arizona in 2016, the last tropical system to hit the region. Rosas remnants are just the latest example of a growing problem: Heavy rain events are on the rise owing to a warmer atmosphere. Were seeing that trend driven by named storms like hurricanes Harvey, Lane, and Florence as well as random rain events like the one that hit Kauai in April. The Southwest has seen a five percent increase in heavy downpours since 1958 even as the region becomes drier, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment. This type of weather whiplash poses a huge infrastructure challenge as city and state planners have to figure out how to prepare communities both for downpours and water conservation in increasingly dry times.","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list?

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Right now, some 7,200 Central Americansincluding many women with small childrenare migrating north toward the U.S. in large, openly visible groups called caravans. Its a dangerous journey that may involve crossing more rivers and encountering human traffickers, but the desperation is real for many communities in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador from where these families hail. A complex mix of issues has pushed these people to flee their homes, including violence and economic troubles. But theres also climate change. Central America, in general, has had chronic impacts of climate change, Ana María Mendez Libby, the country director of Oxfam Guatemala, told Earther. The next migrants are going to be climate migrants. Honduras is the country most affected by climate change already, according to a 2018 report that looked at the years 1997 to 2016, while Nicaragua was among the top five most affected. The main influence climate change is having on this region is driving temperatures up and making rainfall more variable. For more than 1 million families who rely on agriculture in the Dry Corridor, the tropical arid forest region of Central Americas lowlands along the Pacific coast that suffers from irregular rainfall, the devastation can look like years of severe drought exacerbated by El Niño, with blips of intense flooding when torrential rains hit. Experts cant always quantify the number of people who migrate out of a country, but they can estimate migration based on the number who get sent back, explained Mendez. And those estimates show migration from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, in particular, has shot up over the last 10 years. This spike followed years of severe drought in the Dry Corridor. The situation reaching a new level in 2015, which saw the worst drought in 30 years. This year, the drought continues with the governments of these three countries reporting nearly 700,000 acres of losses in corn and bean crops. In El Salvador, this triggered an emergency response. Theres also a leaf rust disease thats been plaguing the coffee crops since 2012, which is linked, in part, to climate variability. And these events dont only impact the people who work the bean, coffee, and corn fields. Reduced agricultural production also impacts parents who rely on these staple crops to feed their children. The 2015 drought, for instance, left more than 3 million people suffering from food insecurity. During El Niño years that spur more drought, Honduras children see a drop in nutrition, school attendance, and ultimately an increase in migration, per the U.N. Human Rights Council. The main driver is, yes, desperation, Mendez told Earther. They have seen its not a seasonal desperation. Its an ongoing continuous desperation for their entire life. Of course, people flee these countries for many other reasons too, violence being an obvious one. El Salvador and Honduras have the highest murder rates in the world, per the World Bank. And people are also escaping economic hardship, according to Mendez. Honduras is the second poorest country in Central America, and Guatemala experiences income inequality at extreme levels, according to the CIA World Factbook. Then, there are also sociopolitical norms that lead to the oppression of women, like El Salvadors flat-out criminalization of abortion. The list of reasons goes on. They dont want to migrate. They dont want to be away from their families. They dont want to be away from the connection they have to their land. Theres no clean water, Mendez said. Theres no health, no education. There are no secure environments mainly for women and children and youth. The role agriculture and environmental woes have played in the lives of those walking among the migrant caravan remain unclear, but these are the types of circumstances that can push a person whos been considering the journey over the edge, said Diego Pons, a research scientist at Columbia Universitys International Research Institute for Climate and Society. They dont want to migrate, Pons told Earther. They dont want to be away from their families. They dont want to be away from the connection they have to their land, but if its not producing enough to feed their families, [migration] is one of the solutions they have to do. If the caravan succeeds in safely reaching the U.S.-Mexico border, this may be a template for future mass migrations. As climate change drives temperatures higher and results in more extreme weather, the number of people looking for an out will only increase. And with an El Niño forecasted later this year, the number fleeing may go up soon. People like Pons are focused on figuring out how to help farmers manage future climate risks in order to help them stay home, which is where most want to be. Until then, get ready. As Salvadoran Environment and Natural Resources Minister Lina Pohl put it this week, The next migrants are going to be climate migrants.","Right now, some 7,200 Central Americans—including many women with small children—are migrating north toward the U.S. in large, openly visible groups called caravans.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","We’re still a few weeks out from the official start of hurricane season, but tropical cyclones don’t care much for regulation. That’s why there’s a small chance one could spin up off the Florida Panhandle this week. A large, low pressure area filled with clouds and thunderstorms has developed across the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and it’s marching slowly northward toward the west coast of Florida. As it moves across warm Gulf waters and gathers strength over the next 48 hours, it has about a 30 percent chance of getting organized into a cyclone. Over the next five days, those odds rise to 40 percent, according to the National Weather Service. Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther that in all likelihood, any cyclone that does form would be classified a tropical or subtropical depression, with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph or less. But, he added, there’s a “small chance” of a named tropical or subtropical storm, one featuring wind speeds of 39—73 mph. “I wouldn’t rule it out, it’s just on the lower side of the probabilities,” Henson said, noting that water temperatures are a bit marginal right now. Regardless of how fierce the storm gets, Floridians are going to feel it. The entire Florida Peninsula could be in for heavy rainfall this week, with eastern Florida around Kennedy Space Center expected to see up to seven inches of precipitation. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing—central and South Florida are coming off a particularly dry dry season, with more than 30 percent of the state in moderate to severe drought as of May 8. “This will slowly alleviate some of the drought conditions,” Henson said, adding that there’s also some concern about localized flash flooding. Predicted rainfall totals for 7-day period ending on May 20. Image: National Weather Service The system has already brought record rainfall to the Florida Keys. By yesterday evening, Key West had notched 3.24 inches of precipitation—more than double the previous May 13 record in logs going back to 1871. On the off chance that the Gulf of Mexico does get a named storm this week, that’d be pretty special. Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach told Earther via email that since 1851, only four named storms have formed in the Gulf of Mexico in May. The last one was in 1976.","We’re still a few weeks out from the official start of hurricane season, but tropical cyclones don’t care much for regulation.

Kyle Hyatt,"You'd think that Volkswagen would have had its fill of impacting the environment. Apparently that's not the case at a Volkswagen factory in Puebla, Mexico, where the automaker has been using cannons to change the weather. These cannons are designed to break apart hail before it forms and rains down on freshly-built cars, and they fire a highly compressed blast of gas into the sky to do so. Farmers in the area surrounding the factory have claimed that the hail cannons have caused drought conditions that damaged their crops and are suing the company for $3.7 million. The above video is an example of an agricultural hail cannon at work, just for reference. Volkswagen isn't the only entity in the region using the cannons, other farmers have them installed as well to prevent the hail from damaging their crops, and the cannons' manufacturer states that its effective radius is only around 600 square feet around the area where the gas is fired. The cannons are fired automatically when certain meteorological conditions are met, but Volkswagen issued a statement from its volcano lair... sorry, I mean from its corporate communications office to Jalopnik, that it would immediately cease the use of the cannons in automatic mode and that it would move to install antihail netting over the storage yards where the cannons are installed.

Swapna Krishna,"The US is only currently committed to funding the ISS through 2024, but most expected that we would continue our support through 2028. At that point, NASA was expected to turn over the US operations of the station to commercial space companies. However, it's unlikely that will be doable by 2024 or 2025; losing the ISS as a low Earth orbit destination so early would be a blow to both NASA and private spaceflight companies. The argument in favor of ending ISS operations early is that we can focus those resources on deeper space exploration. However, that assumes the two are in opposition to one another; they are, in fact, not. The ISS is a necessary stepping stone for missions that take us beyond Earth's orbit. If the US ends support for it before we have a viable method to actually venture into deep space, we could end up with a spaceflight drought because we have nowhere in orbit to send our astronauts. Remember that it's looking like human flight certification for both SpaceX and Boeing won't be until late 2019/early 2020. Nothing is set in stone yet, but the International Space Station has been a crucial example of how countries can work together, regardless of what's happening back on Earth. A signal from the US that we are no longer interested in ISS activities could affect international partners who also are not currently committed to the station beyond 2024. The desire to free ourselves from the shackles lower Earth orbit is certainly understandable, and one many share. But it may not be the best idea to accomplish that at the expense of the ISS.","It appears that there's a troubling line item in President Trump's proposed budget.

Russ Bynum / AP,"(SAVANNAH, Ga.) — The winter calving season for critically endangered right whales is ending without a single newborn being spotted off the southeast U.S. coast, a reproductive drought unseen for three decades that experts say brings the rare species a perilous step closer to extinction. “It’s a pivotal moment for right whales,” said Barb Zoodsma, who oversees the right whale recovery program in the U.S. Southeast for the National Marine Fisheries Service. “If we don’t get serious and figure this out, it very well could be the beginning of the end.” Researchers have been looking since December for newborn right whales off the coasts of Georgia and Florida, where pregnant whales typically migrate each winter to give birth in warmer Atlantic waters. Trained spotters in airplanes who spend the season scouting the coastal waters for mother-and-calf pairs found nothing this season. They wrap up work when the month ends Saturday. Zoodsma said she doesn’t expect any last-minute calf sightings. If she’s right, it will be the first year whale spotters have recorded zero births since survey flights began in 1989. The timing could hardly be worse. Scientists estimate only about 450 North Atlantic right whales remain, and the species suffered terribly in 2017. A total of 17 right whales washed up dead in the U.S. and Canada last year, far outpacing five births. With no rebound in births this past winter, the overall population could shrink further in 2018. One right whale was found dead off the coast of Virginia in January. “It is truly alarming,” said Philip Hamilton, a scientist at the New England Aquarium in Boston who has studied right whales for three decades. “Following a year of such high mortality, it’s clear the population can’t sustain that trajectory.” Right whales have averaged about 17 births per year during the past three decades. Since 2012, all but two seasons have yielded below-average calf counts. Scientists will be looking for newborn stragglers as the whales return to their feeding grounds off the northeastern U.S. this spring. That happened last year, when two previously unseen babies were spotted in Cape Cod Bay. Right whale researcher Charles “Stormy” Mayo of the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts, said he was hopeful some calves were born this season off the Carolinas or Virginia, where scientists weren’t really looking. It’s also possible right whales could rally with a baby boom next year. Females typically take three years or longer between pregnancies, so births can fluctuate year-to-year. The previous rock-bottom year for births — just one calf spotted in 2000 — was followed by 31 newborns in 2001, the second-best calving season on record. “I still think next year or the year after, we could see dozens of right whales calving down here,” said Clay George, a wildlife biologist who oversees right whale surveys for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. With future births uncertain, researchers say more needs to be done to prevent human causes of many right whale deaths. Necropsies performed on the 17 dead whales last year found at least four were struck by ships and at least two died from entanglement in fishing gear. Hamilton said speed restrictions on ships in waters where right whales are most frequently found might be expanded throughout the eastern seaboard to further protect the giant mammals as they roam. Meanwhile, some commercial fishermen are testing gear with ropes that have built-in weak points designed to break rather than ensnare a large whale. Others are working on ropeless lobster pots that use inflatable bags to bring the traps to the surface. “It all has to happen quickly,” Hamilton said. “We can’t handle waiting 10 or 20 years.” Some conservationists are trying to force immediate change. The groups Defenders of Wildlife and the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit in January saying the federal government has failed to protect right whales as required by the Endangered Species Act and called for new regulations on the fishing industry. Scientists suspect entanglements are partly to blame for fewer right whale births as well. Even in cases that aren’t fatal, researchers say, the stress on ensnared females likely makes pregnancies more difficult. Research has shown most females right whales are now dying by age 30, less than half their expected lifespan. And the adult females that had babies last year, identified by unique markings on their heads, were giving birth for the first time in seven or eight years — more than double the typical span between pregnancies. “Right now, the sky is falling,” Zoodsma said. “I do think we can turn this around. But it’s sort of like, what’s our willpower to do so? This is a time for all hands on deck.”",Right whales have hit a reproductive drought,2018-03-26T21:38:13Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",‘The Beginning of the End.’ An Endangered Whales Species Comes Closer to Extinction,http://time.com/5216204/endangered-right-whales-extinction/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/right-whales-extinction-babies.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,drought,1
Adam Rogers,"You can see it on satellite imagery—a chaotic blur of wind and water shaped like a giant alien starfish over Australia, extending a tentacle diagonally across the Pacific and right into the Golden Gate. It’s called an atmospheric river, over a thousand miles of water and wind. This weekend is going to be as wet as an entire typical April. On the official scale, the storm will probably top out at “strong”—it might have enough water vapor transport to rate as “extreme,” but probably won’t reach “exceptional,” the real freak-out level of flood danger. That means several inches of rain. This is how California gets most of its disastrous floods, but also most of its drinking water. It’s a crazy way to do business, but understanding these atmospheric rivers might be the key to making sure the human race doesn’t die of thirst. Atmospheric rivers come ashore on nearly every west-facing coastline on Earth. A few times a year one of them does what this weekend’s storm will do: shotguns over Hawaii and into Northern California. “It tails all the way back into the tropics, almost to the date line,” says Michael Anderson, the California State climatologist. “It’s going to come through pretty quick.” Onshore, the fast, wet air from one of these so-called Pineapple Expresses ricochets upward off the coastal mountain ranges like a tennis ball catching the top of the net. The air rises; the water falls. That’s called “orographic enhancement,” and it’s how you get massive bursts of rain and floods. Somewhere between 30 and 60 percent of California’s entire water supply comes from atmospheric river storms. And they are intense. In one study of six years of California rainfall, monitored hour-by-hour, just 1,460 hours qualified as atmospheric river storms. But that scant 2.8 percent of time accounted for over 50 percent of the rainfall the researchers measured. California hoards more than half of that rain as snowfall on the tops of the Sierras. The rest it tries to save in reservoirs—a dozen big ones and about 150 littler ones scattered up and down the state. In the rainy winter months, the reservoirs fill up—ideally—leaving space for the snowmelt to come in the summer. Ideally. During the winter, all the reservoirs stay empty enough to absorb flood waves from storms. “But on April 1, that reserve space starts being relaxed so they can capture snowmelt,” Anderson says. “With a storm this time of year, you still have that flood reserve space, so there’s room for the reservoirs to catch that water. The question will be, as that reserve space is being relaxed, can that water be kept for the conservation pool?” It’s a balance—hold onto water for a rain-free summer and possible drought, be ready to capture snowmelt, but leave enough room to store a flood wave during the storm season. Every reservoir has a rule curve that says how much water is too much. But atmospheric rivers can make it tough to know when to apply those rules. In November and December of 2012, the Lake Mendocino Reservoir absorbed water from two atmospheric river events, enough so that the water encroached into the “flood pool,” which is supposed to stay empty for emergencies. “So the reservoir operators released the water. It was the prudent thing to do,” says F. Martin Ralph, a research meteorologist at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “But nobody knew that there would be no more atmospheric rivers basically for the rest of the year, and that was the beginning of the drought. They never had a chance to refill the reservoir in the spring.” So Ralph, along with the Sonoma County Water Agency (which regulates the drinking water in Lake Mendocino), the US Army Corps of Engineers (which operates the flood prevention aspects of the reservoir), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which monitors the salmon fishery that’s part of the lake’s hydrology) are all working on a finer-grained system. “It’s possible that with modern weather prediction we can see with some certainty these atmospheric rivers coming a few days ahead, so hypothetically one could consider keeping some of that extra water temporarily, and every day looking at the forecast to see if there’s an atmospheric river,” Ralph says. “If there’s not, the chance of there being a flood problem is essentially zero.” The idea’s still in a planning stage; Ralph’s group is now trying these “forecast-informed reservoir operations” at Mendocino and Prado in southern California. (It's still status quo ante at other reservoirs, like Like Oroville—where the people in charge will be trying out their new spillway, rebuilt since the old one crumbled during last year's rains. But if the new approach works—and so far it seems like it may—reservoirs can keep the water for a not-rainy day. That day may be coming. Or it might not. Water in the American west was variable and unpredictable even before humans started pumping enough carbon into the atmosphere that it’d change the climate. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor. That by itself would strengthen atmospheric rivers. But a warmer atmosphere means warmer poles, which reduces the temperature difference between the middle of the planet and the ends. That means weaker winds and weaker ARs. “However, there’s a big asterisk on that. It’s inevitable that some storms will be just as strong in terms of wind as they are today, and they will have available to them more water vapor,” Ralph says. “There could be a class of atmospheric river storms that are a lot stronger than we’ve seen in the past.” Ralph’s ideas for managing reservoirs better might end up being a necessary adaptation to a changed climate —and not just in California. The northwestern US gets a quarter to a third of its annual rainfall from atmospheric rivers, and they cause floods there, too. Arizona’s and Idaho’s big winter floods are often due to atmospheric rivers; a few years ago one even caused major flooding in Nashville. They are the drivers of flood and drought around the world. So understanding those ocean-spanning tendrils on satellite maps may be the solution to what’s arguably going to be humanity’s most pressing problem: figuring out what to do when the rains come, and when they don’t.",An atmospheric river means this weekend is going to be as wet as an entire typical April.,2018-04-06T17:30:46Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",An Atmospheric River Will Hit California With a Month's Worth of Rain,https://www.wired.com/story/a-months-worth-of-rain-will-hit-california-this-weekend/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ac6bb0b19970475a8fa4ab4/191:100/pass/sfrain_623351114208.jpg,wired,Wired,drought,1

Bill Chappell,"A satellite image provided by DigitalGlobe shows the 416 Fire northwest of Hermosa, Colo., which has forced the closure of the San Juan National Forest. AP The San Juan National Forest in southwestern Colorado is closed to visitors on Tuesday due to a large wildfire and dry, warm conditions that raise the risk of further blazes. Forests are also closed in Arizona and New Mexico, areas that are also suffering from a severe drought. Evacuation orders are in effect, as Colorado Public Radio reports on the blaze known as the 416 fire: ""Residents of over 2,000 homes have been ordered to evacuate because of a fire that started in the forest north of Durango, which doubled in size to about 25 square miles over the weekend. No homes have been lost to the fire."" As of Monday night, the fire was 15 percent contained, the Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team said. For the immediate future, the weather is expected to bring no relief, as temperatures will be in the low 80's and humidity will drop to the single digits. Fire risks are at ""historic levels,"" San Juan National Forest Fire Staff Officer Richard Bustamante said, adding, ""Under current conditions, one abandoned campfire or spark could cause a catastrophic wildfire, and we are not willing to take that chance with the natural and cultural resources under our protection and care, or with human life and property."" The San Juan National Forest comprises some 1.8 million acres across nine counties.

Mark Kaufman,"An hour’s drive from Las Vegas stands America’s Hoover Dam, a commanding barrier of concrete holding back the trillions of gallons of Colorado River water held inside Lake Mead. The dam is a proud place, built by thousands of hands and with 5 million barrels of concrete. Its golden elevator doors, Gotham-esque pillars, and stoic guardian angel statues line the lofty walkways atop the structure. A U.S. flag beating patriotically over the desert gets swapped out every few days, and then put out for sale in the visitor center. Yet, in the 80 years since the great dam’s completion, the 1,450-mile Colorado River – which sustains some 40 million Americans in places like Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles — has been gradually growing weaker, and the water level beyond the noble dam has fallen considerably over the last two decades. The writing is easily spotted on the steep rocky walls of the Lake Mead reservoir, where a bathtub-like ring shows where the water once sat during more fruitful times. SEE ALSO: New islands are being left behind by rapidly retreating Arctic glaciers Today, however, the water sits 150-feet below that line, and human-caused climate change is a major reason why. Over the last century, the river’s flow has declined by around 16 percent, even as annual precipitation slightly increased in the Upper Colorado River Basin — a vast region stretching from Wyoming to New Mexico. The ""bathtub"" ring in Lake Mead behind the Hoover Dam, showing the low level of water in 2015. Image: Jae C. Hong/AP/REX/Shutterstock New research published in the journal Water Resources Research argues that over half of this decline is due to sustained and rising temperatures in the region, which ultimately means more water is evaporated from the river, diminishing the flow. But it’s really been in the last twenty years that matters have deteriorated into a major drought, edging the region toward a potential water-rationing crisis. It's the worst drought in Colorado River history. “The river since 2000 has been in an unprecedented decline,” Brad Udall, coauthor of the new study and senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University, said in an interview. “There’s no analog, from when humans started gauging the river, for this drought,” said Udall. Global temperatures compared to average surface temperatures. Blue shows colder, orange and reds warmer. Image: nasa Global temperatures compared to average surface temperatures. Blue shows colder, orange and reds warmer. Image: nasa To be clear, tens of millions of Americans are not yet imperiled by the drought, but trouble lies in the years ahead. If trends continue, Udall previously projected considerable declines of Colorado River flow by around 20 percent in the next 30 years. By the century's end, this number could increase to 35 percent. The Southwestern U.S. cities dependent on the Colorado River for life and prosperity will have to adapt to a world that’s now warming at an accelerating pace. ""We need to adapt to drier circumstances,"" Karl Flessa, a geoscientist at the University of Arizona who studies water policy in the U.S., said in an interview. In practice, this means using significantly less water both in communities and agriculture (which drinks some 80 percent of the Colorado River), Flessa, who had no involvement in the study, said. The Colorado River Basin Image: usgs Over the last 150 years, humanity has emitted enough greenhouse gases into Earth’s atmosphere to bring carbon dioxide levels up to the highest they’ve been in 800,000 years. The planet is already warmer than it’s been in 120,000 years. “We’re locked in — we can’t go back to the way it was before,” Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan who has previously studied the Colorado River but had no role in this study, said in an interview. To determine the climate’s role in the diminishing river flow, Udall and his team employed a widely used weather model with precipitation data from the last 100 years to determine how the Colorado River would have likely flowed without an increased warming of 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, they compared this model with the warming that has actually occured over the last century, showing how much influence rising temperatures have had on the river’s decline. “It’s a compelling and extraordinarily detailed piece of work — it really nails it,” said Flessa. “The message is climate change is going to decrease the amount of water in what is already a stressed system."" The Hoover Dam. Image: Shutterstock / Palm Tinnapat Rising temperatures, however, are only half the story. Udall found that the other 50 percent of diminishing river flow comes from rain and precipitation falling in the wrong places, meaning areas that are less likely to feed into the Colorado River system. For instance, more plentiful rainfall in Utah deserts will simply evaporate away, said Udall. Still, this study underscores that rising temperatures play an outsized role in the diminishing Colorado River flow, as more heat waves and longer warm seasons dry out the long, winding river. And although some climate analyses predicted more rainfall this century in the Colorado River basin, the rains haven’t yet, and might not ever, come. “Banking on increased precipitation to bail us out is a really bad bet,” said Udall. Instead, Udall emphasized “the need to stop emitting greenhouse gases.” “As long as we keep increasing temperatures on the planet, we’ll have less and less water in the Colorado,” said Overpeck.","An hour’s drive from Las Vegas stands America’s Hoover Dam, a commanding barrier of concrete holding back the trillions of gallons of Colorado River water held inside Lake Mead.

"Madison Park, CNN","(CNN) It may take until September to contain the largest fire in California history, which is now nearly the size of Los Angeles. So far, two firefighters have been injured while fighting the Mendocino Complex Fire, which consists of two fires -- the Ranch Fire and the River Fire -- in Northern California. The pair have burned 292,692 acres and was 34% contained as of Tuesday evening. The colossal fire altogether has destroyed 75 residences, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. Cal Fire estimated that full containment could take until September 1. The Mendocino Complex Fire ignited on July 27. Last year's Thomas Fire, which is the second-largest fire in California history, took more than six months to extinguish after burning 281,893 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.

Trump weighs in on wildfires This week, President Donald Trump appeared to blame California's environmental protection laws for the cataclysmic fires. Administration officials declined to offer any clarity on Trump's series of tweets. Trump claimed in his tweet that the fires were being ""made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized."" He also added that water in the state was ""being diverted into the Pacific Ocean,"" in a tweet that named California Gov. Jerry Brown. ""This does not merit a response,"" said Evan Westrup, Brown's spokesman. Environmental scientists, California water experts and local officials have disputed Trump's claims. ""It is climate change that is causing this,"" says Michael Mohler, spokesman for Cal Fire. ""There is no other way to explain explosive fuel conditions, that come with increased winds and higher temperatures."" California's multiyear drought ended last year, but it also left a lot of dried and weakened plants and trees. ""You don't recover from six years of drought overnight,"" Mohler said. California has approximately more than 100 million dead trees in the state due to drought and infestation from bark beetles. Dead trees pose a major hazard as they allow wildfires to spread rapidly in hot, dry conditions. Cal Fire's vegetation management crews are out year-round to thin and remove such trees, while also doing prescribed burns. Experts cite hotter temperatures causing lengthier fire seasons, that burn up dry, dead vegetation as factors for more wildfires. Other fires in the state continue Cal Fire reported that warm temperatures, with highs in the 90s and triple digits, are expected in most areas of the state -- which isn't good news for firefighters. But a slight cooling is in the forecast for the weekend. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling the wildfires across the state. The second biggest fire in California is the Carr Fire, located in Shasta County in the northern part of the state. The deadly fire has been burning for more than two weeks and consumed 172,055 acres, as of Tuesday evening. It has killed seven people and destroyed more than 1,100 homes. The next largest fire is the Ferguson Fire, near Yosemite National Park, with 94,992 acres. That fire which has lasted more than three week, has killed two people.

Kristen V. Brown,"In September, the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave the green light to a version of the plant Camelina sativa, an important oilseed crop that had been genetically engineered using CRISPR to produce enhanced omega-3 oil. What was interesting about this approval was that the USDA did not ask that the inventors of the plant endure the usual regulatory hoops required to sell biotech crops. The next month, a drought-tolerant soybean variety developed with CRISPR also got a quick pass from the USDA. That’s because while those crops were certainly gene-edited, they were not genetically “modified,” according to USDA regulations. While scientists used CRISPR to snip and tweak the plant’s DNA, they did not add any foreign DNA to it. This, the USDA has now repeatedly found, means those CRISPR-edited plants fall outside of regulatory purview. An interview in Nature with the CEO of Yield10 Bioscience, which developed the camelina, gives new insight into how that regulatory technicality is already making it significantly faster and cheaper to bring new biotech plants to market—shaving years and tens of millions of dollars off production. “It eliminates that huge barrier to entry for agbiotech companies,” CEO Oliver Peoples told Nature. Had the company been forced to endure the usual USDA regulator process, he said, it would have taken at least six years and $30 million to $50 million to test and collect the data required to bring the crop to market. Instead, he said, “We did this in two years and [the USDA’s decision] took two months, and I assure you we didn’t spend $30 million on it.” In April 2016, the USDA gave the first free pass to a CRISPR crop, clearing white-button mushroom that had been edited to not brown as quickly. In its letter to the scientist who developed the engineered mushroom crop, the USDA wrote that because the new mushroom “does not contain any introduced genetic material” it wasn’t even subject to the agency’s GMO regulations. Since the 1990s, the USDA has regulated which genetically modified crops can head to market, not because of fears of harm to human health but because of fear that crops with foreign DNA could accidentally cause environmental damage. A mushroom that simply had some of its DNA deleted, the agency said, seems to present no such threat. Yield10's strategy took a similar tack. Camelina oil is used as a biofuel and a substitute for fish oil in aquaculture. So scientists wanted to spur the plant to produce more oil. To do so, they used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to create breaks in both strands of the plants DNA. They didn’t insert any new genes, but when the plant’s own repair mechanisms kick in to rejoin the DNA, it automatically inactivates an undisclosed gene the boosts oil production. Since those first mushrooms, at least five CRISPR-edited plants have sidestepped the USDA regulatory process. Last year, the agency explained the approach, writing that it “regulates the products of biotechnology and not specific biotech techniques,” so “products of so-called ‘new genome-editing techniques’ would be regulated … only if they pose plant pest or noxious weed risk.” The approach is a stark contrast to the FDA’s approach to gene-edited animals: Last year, t he agency said that it would like to regulate any animal whose genome has been intentionally altered as an “animal drug” regardless of how it was edited or for what purpose. None of the CRISPR plants have made it to market yet. But it seems likely CRISPR produce isn’t so far off from our supermarket shelves.

 Mallappa bought everything needed for his funeral as he didn't want to ""further burden his family""
When Mallappa, a farmer in India's southern state of Andhra Pradesh, left his home in August last year, he told his family he was going to ""buy groceries"". They never dreamed he had decided to take his own life and was actually buying all the things they would need for his funeral. BBC Telugu's Hrudaya Vihari reports. 
Among the things Mallappa bought that day last August were a white cloth to cover his body, bangles for his wife, incense, a garland and a laminated photograph of himself to be displayed in his house after his death.
Upon returning to his village, he placed them all on top of his father's grave, located on his farm.
Along with the items was a note explaining that he had decided to end his life because he could not afford to repay his loans - some 285,000 rupees ($4,000; £3,100) that he had borrowed from banks and money lenders. 
The note said that he had bought everything since he didn't want to further burden his family with the cost of a funeral. 
He then went to a small hut near his field, which he would use to rest during the day while tending to his crops. It was there that he took his own life. 
Early the next morning, his son, Madhavayya, who was taking the cattle out to graze, saw the pile of new things on his grandfather's grave - his father's laminated photograph was among them. 
""I sensed something wrong and I rushed towards the hut. To my shock, my father's body was lying there,"" he told the BBC, weeping.

 Madhavayya discovered his father's body inside a hut he used to rest in
Mallappa's story is becoming a depressingly familiar one in India. 
Indian agriculture has been blighted by falling crop prices, a depleting water table and drought in the last few years.
Farmers struggle with debt, and crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. At least 300,000 farmers across the country have killed themselves since 1995.
Travelling to Mallappa's farm, his peanut crop - ruined due to drought - is easily visible from the roadside. 
""We have six acres of land. We drilled four tube wells to irrigate our crops, but three of them never supplied us with any water. The drought meant that even the fourth tube well did not give us enough water. We had planted tomato and peanuts, so we took a decision to divert water to the tomato crops since we felt we had a better chance of getting a good price for them,"" Madhavayya said. 
But the tomato harvest fetched a rock-bottom price. And Mallappa's hopes - of repaying his debts from his earnings - were dashed.
Good harvests across the country over the last year have led to a crop glut, leading prices to nosedive.
The low price for tomato in 2018 meant that farmers lost roughly 1,000 rupees for every acre of tomato they harvested. Many of them dumped their entire crop on the roads to protest the price they were being offered for it.

Mallappa's family says they never had the slightest indication that he was planning to end his life. 
""When he left for the town that day, he told us he was going to pay off some of the interest on his loans, and would also come back with some provisions and fertiliser,"" Madhavayya said.
""It seems he had planned his suicide for about a week, but none of us had the slightest idea.""
We met Mallappa's wife, Marekka, in the one-room house where she lives with Madhavayya. Her three daughters are married and live in nearby villages, while her younger son moved to the southern city of Bangalore in search of a job.
""He was continuously taking loans for his crops, but they always failed because of the never-ending drought. This year, he thought he could pay off his debts with the harvest, but then we couldn't even do that,"" Marekka said. 
She recalled that on the day he went into the town to shop for his own funeral, Mallappa had received a visitor in the morning.

 Marekka, Mallappa's wife, says they never suspected what he was planning
She said that at least one of the people who he owed money to had threatened him.
Officials say that the drought in the region has been unprecedented - one of them told the BBC that it was the worst on record for the last 54 years.
""Mallappa's death is an example of the severity of drought here. Instead of standing as security, owning agricultural land has become a liability for farmers,"" said SM Bhasha, a human rights activist.
""The conditions in rural areas have deteriorated. The intensity of drought in many parts of the state is increasing. Villages are emptying - only the old are staying on. There isn't even enough drinking water.""
Part of Mallappa's loan was waived by the state government as part of a scheme intended to give relief to indebted farmers.

 Mallappa's son Madhavayya says he is still pinning his hopes on the next harvest
After his death, the government said it would provide his family with 500,000 rupees as compensation. A local official, Gopali Sreenivasulu, told the BBC that they would also settle his bank loans, amounting to 150,000 rupees. 
However, his family is yet to receive any money.
Madhavayya says that he is still pinning his hopes on the tomato crop - and the possibility that the next harvest could fetch a better price.
""We don't know what our fate is,"" he said. ""I am just irrigating the tomato plants in the hope that this may fetch money. If there are no rains and the crop fails, we will have no choice but to sell our land and cattle and migrate to a town.""
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Protests by farmers often involve family members carrying photos of those who took their lives
As we leave the village, we stop by the studio where Mallappa had his photograph laminated. 
The man inside, Govindu, who also works as a freelance photographer, remembered him. ""I took an advance and asked Mallappa to come two days later to collect the laminated photograph."" 
When Mallappa returned two days later, Govindu said, he hadn't laminated it yet. But Mallappa told him he needed it done immediately since he had no time. 
""So I put everything else aside and did it on priority,"" Gonvindu said. 
""When I came across the news of his suicide in the newspaper, I realised he was the same person. If I had known what he was planning to do, I would have at least tried to delay it.""

SIMON ROMERO and THOMAS FULLER,"We had dry winds and low humidities and it extended that dry period, Mr. Rasch said. It also created ideal fire conditions. Driven by extreme winds, the Camp Fire swept through the town of Paradise on Nov. 8, burning more than 153,000 acres and destroying more than 13,500 homes. The death toll, already at 81, is likely to rise. The fire is now about 80 percent contained. Years of drought have parched Californias forests, killing more than 100 million trees this decade. Although a wet winter two years ago helped fill the states reservoirs, most of California is classified as being in a moderate drought. Now with the storm, meteorologists are worried that heavy rain could trigger mudslides. Mr. McLean of Cal Fire said firefighters have cut paths into steep hillsides to help arrest the fire and are now concerned with the stability of paths and dangers to those working in the area. Youve gone from dirt to mud, he said. The rains will also flush the toxic ash and debris from the fires into storm drains and waterways.

Qatar Charity implemented 421 water projects in Somalia, benefiting more than 1mn drought-affected people in the country.
This comes as part of Qatar Charitys efforts to enable poor and 
drought-affected communities to access safe drinking water sources in 
their areas of origin by digging wells and water pools.
Qatar Charity gives these projects a high priority as they play a role in fighting drought.
Qatar Charity also strives to provide water for poor and needy people facing great difficulty in searching for clean water.
Qatar Charity made a huge progress in implementing water projects in 
Somalia last year, as it dug 44 artesian wells at various depths, and 
371 surface wells, as well as 6 water pools in different governorates 
and regions of Somalia.
The number of beneficiaries of water projects from wells and water 
pools in 2018 increased significantly, with more than 1mn beneficiaries,
 while the number of beneficiaries of water projects in 2017 was about 
506,688.
Qatar Charitys head office in Somalia, Abdinur Mursal, said that 
providing safe drinking water to thousands of Somalis, especially in 
remote areas, is one of the top priorities of Qatar Charity Office to 
contribute to community development in Somalia.
He added that Qatar Charity implements many other projects in 
Somalia, such as service facilities from schools, hospitals and medical 
clinics.
Qatar Charity also builds houses for the poor and implements 
income-generating projects that provide job opportunities and reduce the
 unemployment rate in the country, as well as sustainable development 
projects, resettlement and food security.
Through its Somalia office, Qatar Charity has strategic partnerships 
with international organisations such as the United Nations 
International Childrens Emergency Fund, the Food and Agriculture 
Organisation of the United Nations, the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees, the International Medical Corps,the International 
Committee of the Red Cross, and Global One.
Qatar Charity also strengthened its presence within the international
 humanitarian system and its keenness to co-ordinate international aid 
efforts across the world by joining the Somali NGO Consortium in the 
second half of 2018 and participating in the last Alliance meeting.","Qatar Charity implemented 421 water projects in Somalia, benefiting more than 1mn drought-affected people in the country.

"Katie Valentine on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","“Green gold.” “Future plant.” “World vegetable dromedary.” These are just a few of the terms used for the prickly pear cactus, a humble plant that, according to a new book co-published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, can serve as a lifesaving crop for many countries, especially those struggling to adapt to climate change. “It’s actually a fairly amazing crop that can grow in most dry areas of the world,” Makiko Taguchi, a cactus expert at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, told Earther. “And the dry areas of the world are expanding in some places.” The prickly pear is, as Taguchi says, “amazing” for a few key reasons. First, it’s extremely easy to grow: the flat, spiney cladodes, or pads, of the cactus will grow roots wherever they touch soil, so generating a new crop of cacti is as easy as spreading rows of pads on the ground. It’s also extremely hardy: prickly pears can grow in harsh, arid lands where other plants refuse to grow (as long as temperatures don’t dip below freezing, that is). “When they can’t grow anything else, cactus is there to feed the people as well as their animals.”﻿ Second, it barely needs irrigation—and in regions that get at least a little periodic rain, it doesn’t need it at all. Like other cacti, it stores water in its pads, which can be up to 95 percent liquid. It also uses a form of photosynthesis—crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM—that allows it to shut down during the day, when it’s hottest and the rate of water loss would be highest, and collect carbon dioxide during the night. Because of its low water needs, it’s a plant that can thrive even in drought conditions, when other crops wither and die. That’s good news for regions experiencing more frequent and more intense droughts, because the last amazing thing about the prickly pear is that both the cactus’ pads and its fruits are edible, and make nutritious and water-rich foods for humans and their livestock. “In countries like Ethiopia and Madagascar, where they’re experiencing extreme drought, a lot of the people there are actually surviving on cactus,” Taguchi said. “When they can’t grow anything else, cactus is there to feed the people as well as their animals.” A few years ago, for instance, Madagascar was in the midst of a multi-year drought. Crops failed, and many were forced to sell their livestock. But the country narrowly avoided a famine in part because it was able to survive on prickly pear. It’s these life-saving qualities that prompted the UN FAO to spread the word about the prickly pear with the new book, Crop Ecology, Cultivation and Uses of Cactus Pear, co-published by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), which delves into the spiny plant’s history, ecology, and uses around the world. The FAO hopes the book, which also contains tips for growing cacti crops, will help alert arid regions to the cactus’ potential. The book’s release comes as higher temperatures due to climate change are increasing the risk of severe drought around the world. Years that are hot and dry are more likely to result in extreme droughts than years that are cool and dry, and in some places— like California —climate change is making the hot and dry years more frequent. Luckily, the prickly pear thrives in hot, dry weather, and the cactus can even help facilitate the growth of other plants when it’s planted in regions with dry, degraded soil. The prickly pear is native to Mexico, a country where it’s steeped in culture: The plant is featured on the Mexican flag, and Mexico is one of the few places that regularly eats prickly pear pads—or nopales—as well as the plant’s fruit. The pads are grilled and served in salads, tacos, stir fries and other dishes, while the fruit is typically eaten raw or made into jams, juices, or even gelato. The fruits are water-dense and have a refreshing taste similar to watermelon, Taguchi says, while the pads are slightly bitter with a taste typically compared to green beans. The fruits, according to Taguchi, have more antioxidants than apples and tomatoes, and are rich in flavonoids and vitamin C. Apart from Mexico, prickly pears are grown in 26 countries, with countries like Morocco and Algeria beginning to grow the plant for its seed extract, which can have cosmetic and medicinal uses. Cacti were spread from Mexico to Europe by the Spanish conquistadors, who—like the cacti-obsessed of today—valued the plant for its decorative purposes. The plant’s popularity is spreading around the world, Taguchi says, and the UN hopes the book will continue to boost prickly pear’s popularity. “We have been receiving a number of requests from countries in Africa mainly and some South Asian countries for technical support,” she said. “Some countries are realizing that [cacti] are growing in the wild, but they’re not being used.” The prickly pear’s resilience is a rare piece of climate-related good news when it comes to crops. The unpredictable rainfall and temperatures that come with climate change have the potential to disrupt the production of cocoa, coffee, and even corn and wheat. But prickly pear, as well as standing firm in the face of climate change, may even have the potential to help fight it: researchers in Mexico have been looking into ways to turn the cactus’ tough, spiny skin into renewable biogas. Prickly pear, of course, isn’t a miracle crop for everyone: in parts of the world that are getting wetter, for instance, the cactus won’t thrive. And even where it does, other sources of protein and carbohydrates will be necessary for a complete diet. Taguchi says the FAO is looking into a variety of crops, including perennial rices and wheats which could be resilient to different forms of future climate scenarios. Crops that are indigenous to certain regions are also high on their list of priorities, because these crops can tend to be more resilient to climatic changes than introduced crops. But for those regions where hot and dry is becoming more and more the norm, the FAO is going to continue to press for more prickly pear cultivation.

Daniella Cheslow,"Residents wait to fill containers at a source for natural spring water in Cape Town. Bram Janssen/AP In the front yard of a modest house in Cape Town's Khayelitsha township, Samantha Tibisono washes her clothes with water from a communal tap. She lives in Site C, a neighborhood where nearly two-thirds of residents live in shacks with no running water. The city provides communal taps and toilets for sanitation. But lately the taps have run dry. Inside their home, Tibisono's daughter Asavela, 17, points to buckets of water on shelves and under a table. ""Sometimes [we go] two days without water,"" she says. Parched by a historic three-year drought, Cape Town officials have warned for months of a ""Day Zero""—a moment when people will have to line up for daily water rations because the dams that supply the city will be too low to pump water to houses. But many people around the city already face a water shortage. Some say every day is Day Zero. Hose Woes To stave off Day Zero, Cape Town has imposed sharp limits on water consumption — 13 gallons per person per day — with high fees for overuse. (By comparison, the average American uses 88 gallons a day.) The city also lowered the water pressure in its pipes, which officials say is the reason that Tibisono's tap is sometimes empty. Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson says frugal residents have helped pull the city back from the brink. Since January, water consumption has fallen from over 600 million liters a day to about 520 million. That's half of daily consumption in 2015. ""Provided we continue our current water-saving efforts, Day Zero can be avoided completely this year,"" Neilson said in a statement. Down the street from Tibisono, Kwande Kulu sprays vehicles with a pressure hose. He says city officials threatened to close his car wash for wasting municipal water. So he paid to drill a well and now uses groundwater to wash the cars. ""If you have a borehole, you're sorted,"" he says. ""You're safe."" (That's a deep, narrow shaft bored into the ground to extract water.) One of his customers, Zola Mfakado, drinks beer and eats grilled sheep meat while he waits for his car. He says he's one of the lucky few in the township with a flushing communal toilet. Many others use buckets. About 13 percent of Cape Town's residents lack indoor plumbing, according to a 2013 city report. ""The issue of Day Zero doesn't mean anything to us because we've always been on day zero,"" Mfakado says. Trickle-Down Economics The water shortage in Cape Town has had far-reaching economic consequences. Labor lawyer Michael Bagraim, a South African Parliament lawmaker with the Democratic Alliance opposition party, says Day Zero warnings helped curb water use—but also scared away tourists from the country's second-largest city. Agriculture has likewise been affected, with crops drying out and farmers releasing water from private dams to help shore up the dwindling supply. Bagraim estimates that the water shortage has led to the loss of about a quarter-million jobs in the Western Cape province that includes Cape Town. And prices for fruit, vegetables, and wheat are expected to rise. ""It has created anxiety in the business community,"" Bagraim says. ""That fear translated into many of the businesses saying, 'Well, we want to retrench.'"" City counselor Xanthea Limberg says Cape Town is working on several desalination plants and groundwater development projects, which should begin to bolster the water supply in the coming months. For now, residents are relying on charity and their own ingenuity. At the Isikhokelo Primary School in Khayelitsha, Principal Yoliswa Qomoyi recently put covers and padlocks over outdoor taps — and closed all but one faucet in each of the student bathrooms — to comply with water restrictions. She asked parents to send their kids to school with water. ""With us, there is high unemployment rate, so parents cannot afford to buy them water from the supermarkets. Its not easy for them,"" Qomoyi says. On a recent morning, she was relieved to see a truck pull up to the school loaded with 500 gallons of water in two pallets of bottles. Schoolboys wearing matching green cardigans and gray slacks hopped into the truck and formed a chain to pass them to their classmates, who carried them into the school's courtyard. Hlomla Myendeki, 12, says he walks more than a mile to school, carrying water from home that he often has to share when he arrives. ""How can you stand with other learners but you can't share with them?"" he asks. As he spoke, students crowded against a wall to pose for pictures with hundreds of water bottles.. Awonke Matinise, 12, says the water shortage can makes school difficult. ""Sometimes I get thirsty and realize that there's no water in our school,"" she says. ""So I just have to just stand there and write the papers."" Schoolboys unload donated water at the Isikhokelo Primary School in Khayelitsha township. The principal shut off most taps to keep to tight water restrictions and has told students to bring their own water. Daniella Cheslow/NPR The Burden Of Thirst The water that arrived at the Isikhokelo school came from the Gift of the Givers Foundation. The charity's Cape Town program manager, Ali Sablay, says he constantly fields calls from schools, institutions and homes for the elderly. ""There's a real panic,"" he says. The charity hopes to provide longer-term solutions to the water shortage. In February it bought a drill rig to dig 200 groundwater boreholes across Cape Town in the coming months. Sablay recently visited the rig at the Peak View Secondary School in the suburb of Athlone. It clattered in the schoolyard as it probed the earth for groundwater and splattered fine wet dust over students on their lunch break. Sablay says that after the water from the borehole is treated, it will supply not only the school but also the surrounding neighborhood. ""That will be a big relief to the school community,"" says Peak View Principal Oswald De Villiers. The vast majority of his students live in townships, he says. To get water, they have to walk to communal taps. ""Once we find water,"" he says, ""we are going to give each and every learner five liters a day to take home, so we can also ease the burden on them."" Water Pleasure For now, the water restrictions are a hardship even for the fairly well off. Musician Bylelwa Sakayi, a mother of two young children, says the rules and limits are hard to comply with. ""You have to run after [your kids] when they go into the loo and remind them—constantly remind them—not to flush,"" she says. Sakayi's brick house in Khayelitsha has indoor plumbing. But she lives in fear that authorities will cut off her water or charge her high rates if she exceeds restrictions. For a recent music gig, Sakayi stayed at a hotel in a Cape Town suburb—and got a rare treat. ""Before I got dressed and made up, I went into the shower,"" she says. ""I let it run, I let it run. It felt so good."" Daniella Cheslow is an international reporter covering climate and cuisine. When she's not on the road she works as an editor at NPR headquarters in Washington.

Tom McKay,"Southern California’s Thomas fire is now officially the largest in modern state history, Cal Fire announced late Friday night, after surpassing the 273,000-plus acre Cedar fire from 2003. Per CNN, Cal Fire says the blaze has now burned through some 1,063 buildings and is just 65 percent contained weeks after starting on December 4th. It also said it expects fire crews to be working on the blaze 24/7 until at least January 7th. The fire began in Ventura County and spread to neighboring Santa Barbara County, fueled by flame-optimal winds and plenty of dry brush to burn. As the L.A. Times reported, the official list of wildfires only dates back to 1932 because prior records are less reliable. One contender for the all-time spot remains the 1889 Santiago Canyon fire, which reputedly scorched some 300,000 acres (and some research supports those accounts ). Large stretches of southern California now lie in ruins. In some cases, the fire spread so fast that terrified residents were forced to evacuate without their possessions in the dead of night as smoke surrounded their homes. “I feel like I’m spinning,” local resident Jeff Jacobson, whose house was mostly burned, told the L.A. Times. “I’m overwhelmed and stressed, which is hard because I need to be clear-minded.” According to officials, this is the worst season for wildfires in memory. Wildfires have ravaged vast parts of the state this year, with blazes burning from southern California all the way up to wine-growing regions hundreds of miles to the north. The frequency of massive fires in the state has dramatically increased in the last few decades, due to both accidental blazes started by humans and trends linked to climate change like extreme droughts. “We think that this fire, the Thomas fire, is likely very large in part not just because the Santa Ana wind event is long, but there was this very extreme drought between 2012 and 2014,” UCLA and U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist Jon Keeley told the Times. “What extreme droughts do is they cause dieback of the vegetation,” he added. “Basically a canopy of the vegetation dies and oftentimes the entire plant dies. So you have lots of dead vegetation out on the landscape from the drought. And when the Santa Ana winds blow embers ahead of the fire front, they’ll ignite spot fires, but only if they land on dead vegetation.” Fire officials said that the blaze is contained enough that any further spread will be the result of deliberate actions by firefighters, not uncontrolled expansion. “The main fire itself will not have any growth,” the California City Fire Department’s Captain Brandon Vaccaro told the Times. “Any growth that we see or is reflected in the acreage will be based on the control burns.” [ CNN ]","Southern California’s Thomas fire is now officially the largest in modern state history, Cal Fire announced late Friday night, after surpassing the 273,000-plus acre Cedar fire from 2003.

"USA TODAY, Kristin Lam, USA TODAY","The desert pops with color during a rare super bloom near Palm Springs.
 USA TODAY
California is completely drought free for the first time since 2011 as a wet winter winds down, scientists said. 
Abnormally dry conditions linger in less than 7 percent of California, the U.S. Drought Monitor said on Thursday, as storms have filled reservoirs, built snow pack and improved soil moisture. The state had experienced some form of drought for 376 consecutive weeks, according to the National Drought Mitigation Center. 
Parts of Southern California are drier than normal, the drought monitor said in its weekly report, because of prior years of little rain, but none qualify as having drought conditions. Reservoirs in San Diego County are only at 65 percent capacity.
While Newsha Ajami, Stanford University's Director of Urban Water Policy, described the drought report and this winter's rain and snow as exciting, she said they are not signs for a wet future. 
""If we have a few more years of this, then maybe our groundwater conditions will be in a much better shape and we might be in a better shape to deal with another potential drought, which will come,"" Ajami said. ""California has a Mediterranean climate so we do experience a lot of ups and downs in our weather conditions.""  
Multiple years of dry periods back to back, Ajami said, can cause drought conditions. The water year before the drought began in December 2011, Ajami said California recorded rainy, snowy and cool conditions similar to the way it did this year.
Record hot and dry years thereafter led then-Gov. Jerry Brown to declare a drought state of emergency. Between 2010 and 2016, more than 102 million state trees died on 7.7 million acres of the forest, the U.S. Forest Service said. 
The state only ended executive orders for water restrictions in 2017, when less than 9 percent of the state recorded drought conditions. But at the start of 2019, more than 75 percent of the state experienced some level of drought.
Above average amounts of rain and snow since have boosted water supplies and the the snowpack in mountain ranges including the Sierra Nevada, where the state recorded levels 153 percent of average at the end of February. Wildflowers have also blossomed in Southern California because of the rain.

Related: Mudslides, floods, rain, howling winds: California hit by dangerous storm
But downpours have also triggered mudslides and flooding, including in areas burned by recent wildfires. Rain transformed the Sonoma County wine country town of Guerneville into an island and caused millions in damage to highways in the San Jacinto Mountains east of Los Angeles. 
As the capital reports 126 percent of normal rain levels, according to the National Weather Service's Sacramento office Wednesday, the situation is far different from when state campaigns encouraged residents to let their lawns fade to gold for the summer.
Regardless of current drought conditions, Ajami said, conserving water and using the resource efficiently and consciously should be an everyday practice.
""The reality is we will be going in and out of drought over time,"" Ajami said. ""We can't waste water for purposes that are not necessary.""

Reuters Editorial,"TAOS, New Mexico (Reuters) - A man was arrested on Saturday on charges of starting a forest fire in Colorado that has destroyed structures and forced hundreds to evacuate their homes in one of dozens of wildfires raging across the drought-hit U.S. southwest. Jesper Joergensen, 52, was taken into custody for suspected arson that started the Springs Fire, the most active of around 10 blazes in Colorado, the state hardest hit by fires, according to Costilla County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page. Joergensen is not a U.S. citizen and will be handed over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement once he has faced arson charges, said a Costilla County detention officer. The officer could not immediately say what nationality Joergensen held. The fire has scorched over 38,000 acres (15,378 hectares) between the towns of Fort Garland and La Veta in southern Colorado, forcing more mandatory evacuations of homes and ranches on Saturday in a mountainous area of public and private land. The fire continued to grow, fueled by temperatures in the mid 80s Fahrenheit (27 Celsius) and had zero percent containment as of Saturday afternoon. Air tankers and helicopters dropped fire retardant and water on the blaze. Authorities asked evacuated residents not to fly drones to check on their properties as the devices posed a danger to aircraft and would force them to be grounded. An unknown number of structures were consumed by the fire, said Bethany Urban, a public information officer. No injuries have been reported. Gusty winds, single-digit humidity and hot temperatures have fueled the fires and could ignite new blazes in the U.S. West, the National Weather Service said in several warnings. The largest wildfire in Colorado, the 416 Fire, has charred almost 47,000 acres about 13 miles (21 km) north of Durango in the southwest corner of the state, and is 37 percent contained, said public information officer Brandalyn Vonk. About 10 smaller wildfires were burning in New Mexico and three in Arizona, with much of the two states suffering extreme or exceptional drought conditions. All but the northeastern corner of Colorado is experiencing moderate to exceptional drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Seth Borenstein / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — With three strong hurricanes, wildfires, hail, flooding, tornadoes and drought, the United States tallied a record high bill last year for weather disasters: $306 billion. The U.S. had 16 disasters last year with damage exceeding a billion dollars, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. That ties 2011 for the number of billion-dollar disasters, but the total cost blew past the previous record of $215 billion in 2005. Costs are adjusted for inflation and NOAA keeps track of billion-dollar weather disasters going back to 1980. Three of the five most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history hit last year. Hurricane Harvey cost $125 billion, second only to 2005’s Katrina, while Maria cost $90 billion, ranking third, NOAA said. Irma was $50 billion, for the fifth most expensive hurricane. Western wildfires fanned by heat racked up $18 billion in damage, triple the previous U.S. wildfire record, according to NOAA. “While we have to be careful about knee-jerk cause-effect discussions, the National Academy of Science and recent peer-reviewed literature continue to show that some of today’s extremes have climate change fingerprints on them,” said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society. NOAA announced its figures at the society’s annual conference in Austin, Texas. The weather agency also said that 2017 was the third hottest year in U.S. records for the Lower 48 states with an annual temperature of 54.6 degrees (12.6 degrees Celsius) — 2.6 degrees warmer than the 20th century average. Only 2012 and 2016 were warmer. The five warmest years for the Lower 48 states have all happened since 2006. This was the third straight year that all 50 states had above average temperatures for the year. Five states — Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and New Mexico — had their warmest year ever.

SCOTT BRANSFORD and CHRISTINA CARON,"As of Saturday morning the fire, which is known as the Carr Fire, had burned more than 80,000 acres, up from more than 40,000 on Friday. It has destroyed 500 structures and forced the evacuations of approximately 39,000 people, the authorities said on Saturday. Mr. Kewley, who lives about two miles from the Bledsoes near the Sacramento River in Redding, about 160 miles north of Sacramento, said the family had been keeping track of the fire but did not receive evacuation orders on Thursday. Then he said he saw the fire “start chewing through the other side of the river.” “Eight o’clock rolls around and everything just exploded, and everything was on fire,” he said, adding that subdivisions a mile away were “lighting up like the Fourth of July.” In the neighborhood in Redding where Ms. Bledsoe and the two children perished, the smoldering wreckage of incinerated homes lined the streets, sometimes juxtaposed with dwellings that had remained intact or sustained only minor damage. Downed power lines snaked across streets, which were largely empty except for the police and fire personnel surveying the damage and utility workers making repairs. The topography of the area, a mix of rolling hills, canyons and flatlands, spoke to the combustibility of landscapes in this part of Northern California, where communities are often built into what fire experts call the wildland-urban interface. Interspersed between streets and cul-de-sacs were swaths of open space filled with drought-stressed oaks, manzanita and brush, all of which provide powerful fuels when ignited.","Ed Bledsoe left his wife and great-grandchildren to run errands and gather supplies.

JENNIFER MEDINA and INYOUNG KANG,"Q. Can you talk more about the difference between the eras that father and son governed in? A. Pat Brown proudly presided over California during a time of phenomenal growth — every day, for a decade, 1,000 people a day moved here, and another 1,000 babies were born. He felt the urgency to provide water, schools, roads and colleges for current and future Californians. He governed with exuberance and a faith that unlimited resources would build the largest, greatest state in the country. By the time his son took office in 1975, only eight years after Pat Brown had been defeated by Ronald Reagan, bigger was no longer better. Smog, traffic, budget deficits, a recession, a drought, student protests, racial unrest had all changed the complexion of California. Q. Is there anything about the Brown family story that many or most Californians could relate to? Or are they just totally in a league of their own from the get-go? A. There are a lot of ways in which the Brown family saga resonates for many Californians. They are descendants of immigrants — German and Irish, in their case — drawn here for the same reasons that so many have come for decades: opportunity, openness, lack of an established social order. They stayed because of a deep attachment to the people, the land, the sense of California exceptionalism, an appreciation of everything from the Russian River to the U.C. system.","Wednesday: The historian Miriam Pawel talks about the governor’s family history, Christine Blasey Ford wants an F.B.I. investigation, and a Santa Barbara teenager finds $10,000.",2018-09-19T12:36:57Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","California Today: California Today: To Tell the Brown Family Saga, Start in 1852",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/us/california-today-browns-miriam-pawel.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/19/us/19californiatoday1/19californiatoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,drought,1
Gabriel Burin,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina’s economy is ending a year of “endless storms,” in the words of President Mauricio Macri. The storms included a severe drought, the ripple effects of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, the crash of the country’s peso currency, and policy missteps. 
The country is now suffering the worst of a recession that is expected to last until the second quarter of 2019, when the government hopes a strong recovery will take hold. But rising unemployment and high inflation remain serious threats to that rosy outlook. [L1N1YI0SW] 
SCORCHED SOY FIELDS 
A dry spell that set in a year ago on the Pampas grains belt continued unabated for months, scorching soy fields and withering Argentina’s top export. The country’s 2017-2018 soy crop was the poorest in nine years, and other key grains like corn also suffered from the lack of rains. 
The drought contributed to a jump in agricultural market prices and left China without one of its main feed suppliers just as trade tensions soared with the United States. 
EXPOSURE TO FED PAINS 
Monetary policy in Washington was another source of pain for Argentina. The first Fed rate move of 2018, in March, triggered a flight from all emerging market assets. Latin America’s third-biggest economy was particularly exposed due to its bulging macro deficits and heavy load of dollar-denominated debt. 
Investors turned to sell mode on the country’s sovereign bonds, making it hard for the country to borrow on international markets. Fears of financial instability prompted ordinary Argentines to begin exchanging their pesos for safe U.S. dollars, driving down the value of the Argentine currency. 
1 PESO = $2.5 CENTS 
Foreign exchange chaos ensued. The peso, which had been hovering at 20 per dollar ($5 cents) since January, lost its footing in a downward spiral that sent it to 30 against the dollar ($3.3 cents) in August and to 40 ($2.5 cents) in September. 
The central bank reacted by raising interest rates and selling dollars, with little success. Macri turned to the International Monetary Fund for help, adopted a strict monetary plan to fight escalating inflation and passed an austere budget in Congress amid violent protests. 
MISTAKES, CORRUPTION, POLITICS 
Macri, whose approval ratings have tumbled, has acknowledged some mistakes, such as setting economic goals that were too optimistic and failing to coordinate policies. Economic confidence was further eroded by a corruption case that implicated major construction contractors and former President Cristina Fernandez, whose reappearance as a likely candidate in next year’s election has unnerved investors. Fernandez has denied the charges against her.

IVAN PENN and INYOUNG KANG,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) California has been a leader in trying to counter the forces contributing to climate change, from its stringent standards for auto emissions to its mandate that 50 percent of the state’s electricity come from carbon-free sources by 2030. Now, with climate concerns magnified by extreme summer temperatures and catastrophic wildfires, lawmakers are considering a move that would go further: a proposal to mandate 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2045. The bill’s sponsor, State Senator Kevin de León, says that with the Trump administration’s efforts to bolster electricity generated from fossil fuels, California and other states must chart their own course on energy policy. And, partly owing to recent events, he thinks the bill can pass within three weeks. “Because of the fires, because of the extreme drought, because of the anti-environmental edicts coming from this president, there’s a huge ground swell of support,” Mr. de León said of his proposal, designated Senate Bill 100.",Wind turbines lined the Altamont Pass near Livermore in 2013.

Increasing research effort is being focused on the ecological effects of drought on the world's tropical forested regions. Rowland et al. measured the multiyear effects of drought on the litterfall of leaves, flowers and fruits, and twigs in a Brazilian forest. Drought was simulated by covering a 1-hectare experimental plot with plastic panels 1 to 2 meters above the ground. Litterfall over 14 years was compared with that on an uncovered neighboring plot. Litterfall of flowers and fruits decreased by more than half during the first 4 years. After 10 years, where trees survived, the fall of reproductive parts recovered to levels that exceeded those in the control plot.

Sasha Lekach,"Climate scientists may be self-censoring in order to get their work funded through government grants. New data released by NPR this week shows that grants and research proposals from the National Science Foundation (NSF) using the term ""climate change"" in their title or summary have dropped by 40 percent this year when compared to 2016. SEE ALSO: Shocking no one, the EPA's Scott Pruitt denies findings of new climate science report That's only 302 grants using the term this year compared to 520 last year, NPR reported. And according to researchers, that reduction might have everything to do with a political climate that's hostile to their work. Jacquelyn Gill, assistant professor of paleoecology at the University of Maine's Climate Change Institute, said in an interview Wednesday that the decrease is likely a self-preservation tactic. Scientists know that work concerning climate research is closely watched and certain terms flagged. Gill said scientists are ""often coached to talk about climate change without talking about climate change."" So they communicate more specifically and avoid the politically-charged term. ""You want to protect the funding. You want to do the research. You want to avoid spurious lawsuits,"" she said, ""but you also want to be make sure the work you are doing is impactful."" Gill worries that the balancing act will eventually eliminate climate change from the national dialogue, all because of this ""language game."" Even though the specific focus areas within climate research will persist, like extreme precipitation, drought, effects on animal behavior, and more, the overall umbrella term might morph over time. The NSF, with a budget of $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2017, is one of the largest funders of climate science research in the U.S. An NSF spokesperson said the organization doesn't comment on outside analyses, so they wouldn't weigh in on the declining use of the term. To NPR, the same spokesperson added, ""NSF takes no position on the language used by researchers to describe physical processes and outcomes if the merit review process judges the language to be appropriate.” Not everyone thinks that scientists are censoring themselves to work around a hostile administration, however. Texas A&amp;M University atmospheric sciences professor Andrew Dessler has an alternate hypothesis of what's happening with the climate change proposals. He thinks the conversations and research about climate change are changing and becoming more specific as the science advances. There's more to discover from narrower fields, such as ""extreme weather,"" than the more all-encompassing concept of climate change. ""I'm skeptical that people are self-censoring,"" he said in an interview on Wednesday. Instead, the focus is shifting. Dessler said he would have no qualms about submitting a research grant proposal using the term ""climate change."" NSF grants aren't the only space where ""climate change"" is slowly vanishing because of political pressure from the current administration. Look to the U.S. Department of Energy, which earlier this year asked researchers to remove ""climate change"" and ""global warming"" from project descriptions seeking funding approval. Or there's the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which removed its extensive climate change website in April and has not fully restored it since. Both EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and Energy Secretary Rick Perry reject the mainstream climate science evidence showing that global warming is largely human-caused. No matter what you call it or how hard you scrub government websites, the manifestations of climate change, with changing weather patterns, hotter temperatures, drought, and sea level rise, are still happening, and will only get worse with time.","Climate scientists may be self-censoring in order to get their work funded through government grants.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Despite being surrounded by water, Cape Town found itself at risk of running out of water When Cape Town revealed it was fast hurtling towards the moment it would become the first city on earth to run out of water earlier this year, it caught the world's attention. Initial predictions said the taps in this South African city of four million people should have run dry by April. But despite the odds appearing stacked against it, the dams never fell to 13.5% - the level needed to reach ""Day Zero"", which has now been pushed back to next year at the earliest. The rains have finally arrived, and Cape Town appears to pulled itself back from the brink - for now. So, what lessons have been learned? Icebergs could be the answer At times like this, it is probably always worth thinking outside the box. But when Nick Sloane - a South African salvage captain known for righting the Costa Concordia - announced he could solve the issue by dragging a 100 million tonne iceberg north from the Antarctic, more than a few eyebrows were raised. But, Capt Sloane assured the BBC's Newsday programme, it is completely possible. ""At any one time there are thousands of icebergs which have broken off drifting around the Southern Ocean,"" he said. ""Most of the icebergs are pushed south by the Agulhas current. We going to try and guide the iceberg into a different current: the Benguela current."" Image copyright AFP Image caption Cape Town residents had to queue for water The current, he explained, is cold so the iceberg would be preserved - and crucially would be taken some 1,200 nautical miles north to near Cape Town, where it should - in theory - come to a halt on the sea bed. But why go to all this effort? Well, one of these icebergs would provide enough water for a third of Cape Town's residents for an entire year. Cape Town's deputy mayor Ian Neilson still needs to be convinced though - especially because moving icebergs thousands of miles is not without risk, and definitely not cheap. ""The questions are: 'What is the price, how long is it going to take?'"" he told the BBC. ""So a really strong case would need to be made."" And anyway, the city already has its own plans in place to supplement its dams. ""Certainly, we are driving projects around ground water, water reuse and desalination, and until we see something better that's what we will do,"" he explained. Image copyright Reuters Image caption An iceberg measuring at least 500m by 500m could be the answer to Cape Town's water crisis Which seems to suggest that another idea, mooted more than a decade ago, to drive water 2,500 miles from the Congo River to Cape Town is probably not going to happen. Which is good, because that water is also being eyed up as a possible solution to Africa's vanishing lake. You can live on 50 litres of water a day... The crisis really caught the world's attention after it was announced citizens would only be allowed to live on 50 litres of water a day. But Capetonians quickly adapted. Ninety-second showers, unflushed loos and dirty cars are matters of pride in Cape Town homes, while some restaurants have completely shut off their bathroom taps, forcing customers to opt for hand sanitizer instead, and many public swimming pools are empty. And it has worked. ""We have got our overall consumption down by 50%,"" said Mr Neilson. ""It could not have been achieved by just a small number of people. Very clearly, there has been a change in people's approach to water."" Image copyright AFP Image caption Last year, religious leaders, including Khoisan leader Ockert Lewies, pictured, gathered at the bottom of Table Mountain to pray for rain Of course, there are places still boasting perfectly manicured, green lawns. But generally these all come with a sign on the wall declaring - somewhat defensively - ""borehole water"", meaning they are not using the mains supply. Borehole digging, in turn, has become a new source of income for Cape Town's entrepreneurs, with adverts offering the service on lampposts across the city. And if you still suspect your neighbour of not doing their part, there is a handy interactive map which shows exactly how much each street is using.... the poorest residents already do When Day Zero was first announced, there was a bit of finger-pointing towards the city's informal settlements, where it was claimed by some that taps ran almost non-stop. Quite simply, Mr Neilson said, this was not true. According to South Africa's News24, even before the drought, homes in Cape Town's informal settlements used just 40 litres per day. Image caption Research by Martine Visser and Johanna Bruhl, of the University of Cape Town, showed usage dropped from 540l per household per day in January 2015, to 280l in January 2018. ""Informal settlements use less than 4% of the water. That's not the place where the problem is,"" Mr Neilson said. ""The big usage was what takes place behind big walls."" It may not be a good idea to tell tourists Day Zero may have been enough to frighten Capetonians into action, but it had an unfortunate side effect: it also scared the tourists. Cape Town and the wider Western Cape welcome more than 1.6m international visitors a year - not to mention the 2.1m South Africans who holiday in the region. But at the height of the crisis, an informal study of 18 businesses by the province's tourism agency, Wesgro, found revenue for January and February had fallen by up to 20% year-on-year. Which, when 300,000 people rely on tourism for their wage across the Western Cape, was not good news. Image copyright AFP Image caption These tourists were not put off by the warnings of water shortages But Wesgro responded, encouraging tourists to become part of the solution, and promoting sustainable, ""water-wise tourism"". They also sent out the message that Cape Town was still open for business - and it looks like it is working: August and September are seeing year-on-year increases in bookings of 4% and 5% respectively. And finally: Prevention is better than cure Cape Town, Mr Nielson admitted, was taken by surprise by the three-year drought which led to the dire warnings. ""The rainfall that we have had has fallen off the charts, and it happened instantly - overnight,"" he says. ""Change can happen and hit you far more quickly and more dramatically than you anticipated. So how do you prepare for that? ""If you depend on just one source of water supply only, you need to change and diversify. You must start putting things into place before this disaster happens so you already have this resilience built in."" Image copyright AFP Image caption The dams, like this one outside Cape Town, still have a long way to go to refill Cape Town should now be able to build up its own ability to withstand another drought like this one, not only with its water plans, but also by putting in new legislation to ensure homes are more water-efficient in the future. But more than that, it is hoped people will stick to the changes they have made - albeit eventually in a less draconian way. After all, following the last big drought it took a decade for water consumption to reach its previous levels, Mr Neilson said. And what's more, saving water has now become a badge of honour for the city's residents.",How did Cape Town - on the verge of being the first city to run out of water - come back from the brink?,2018-05-13T00:59:28Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Icebergs and empty pools: Five things Cape Town's Day Zero taught us,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-43989106,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/63BD/production/_101233552_d97228e1-5d99-45b5-8fbb-5e4079a3eecd.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,drought,1

Linda Smith, 64, and her husband Jim were feeding kangaroos hit by drought conditions in Queensland when the 6ft (1.82m) grey turned on Jim. The couple and their son fought off the attack, said by wildlife officials to be rare, with a broom and a shovel. The animal hopped off into the bush before emergency services arrived. The incident occurred in Millmerran, about 80km (50 miles) south-west of Toowoomba in Queensland. Speaking from hospital, where the couple are both being treated, Mrs Smith told the Brisbane Times that some 30 kangaroos and wallabies usually arrive each night to be fed because of the drought, and are given grain and chaff. She said: ""This one kangaroo came in and I thought it was Golly Gosh, one of the kangaroos we have raised. He was a huge grey, would have been at least 6ft."" As her husband, also in his 60s, fed the kangaroo it turned on him. ""Jim was on the ground and the kangaroo just kept at him,"" Mrs Smith said.

JORI FINKEL,"Ms. Ellegood said she was especially surprised to see ecological images crop up from artists not known for that work. Flora Wiegmann made a piece called “Reduction Burn,” a six-channel video of a dance performance that she choreographed. Her title refers to “hazard reduction burns,” the planned fires often used to deforest areas on the verge of becoming tinderboxes. The first section of her work establishes the dancers, wearing sleeveless green shirts, as a forest, swaying like trees in the wind. The third evokes a fire spreading (thanks to red accents in the costumes and more dynamic jumping and spinning movements), while the final sections show the fire collapsing into embers. “This process is regenerating for the forest,” said Ms. Wiegmann, noting that it allows for “new growth.” For the artist the cycle is suggestive of individuals overcoming personal injury or trauma and “all the political and social flare-ups happening today,” she said. In his gallery at the Hammer, Charles Long has created a small forest’s worth of stumplike, treelike or loglike sculptures. His point of departure was fallen-tree sightings close to home in Mount Baldy, a mountain village east of Los Angeles. “I started noticing over the last two years a lot of the big old trees in our village were sort of choking out and getting cut down because of the drought and overcrowding,” he said. “It happens so much that people don’t even remove them, they just chop them up and leave them all over the village.”","At the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, the artist MPA stands between her works “Eye” (2018) and, right, “Sunglasses (Left)” (2018), part of the museum’s “Made in L.A.” biennial.",2018-06-03T21:01:25Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Signs of the Apocalypse at the Hammer Museum,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/03/arts/design/hammer-museum-los-angeles-biennial.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/02/arts/02hammerpreview1/02hammerpreview1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,drought,1

America's golden state is renowned for its hot, dry, sunny climate - and recently for drought and wildfires - so the BBC's Dan Johnson was at least expecting a break from typical British weather when he was posted to Los Angeles at the start of the year. That's not quite how it worked out.
Three months in Los Angeles. It sounded like a wonderful way to spend the winter. I had visions of weekends at the beach and afternoons by the pool. But I arrived to find it was raining. A storm passing through, I was assured. It would be gone in a few days and then the sun would shine. And it did. 
But then another storm came in - and another, and another. I kept tuning in for the local TV weather forecast presented by a man called, I kid you not, Dallas Raines. There wasn't a hint of gloom about his own sunny outlook and bright shiny smile but his map told a very different tale. Downtown Los Angeles saw more rain in January and February than during the whole of last year. It was welcomed by the locals. Refreshing, they said, and much needed to replenish reservoirs and ward off wildfires.

Parts of California have experienced drought since 2011. But after 376 consecutive weeks the state has at last been declared drought-free. The LA River, normally just a trickle at the bottom of a concrete canyon storm drain, has been a gushing torrent, trillions of gallons of water funnelled but then flushed straight out into the Pacific Ocean. There was flooding in the north of the state. Mudslides buried homes on hillsides still cracked and scorched from last year's wildfires. Roads are splitting open and the city's soaring freeways are afflicted by potholes. Drivers panic because they don't know how to deal with the wet conditions.

People here are used to the weather being a constant, pleasant, mostly dry 20 to 25C, a reliable steady backdrop to LA life. Suddenly, though, it's become a topic of conversation. People talk about the weather. Then they talk about how much they're talking about the weather. Then finally they agree not to talk about the weather. Roofs are leaking after being pounded so heavily. Doors have swelled and filled their frames, drains have overflowed. Rainbows have become regular sights, hailstones a new threat.

During one storm more than 1,000 lightning strikes were recorded. Trees came down. A plane was hit and had to turn back. The airport suffered a power cut. Snow was forecast even as low as the Hollywood sign. In the mountains ski resorts have boomed as long as the roads have been passable and the whole place is green, so green.

The hillsides around LA are lush and the views are stunning. Forget ""smog city"" clouded with pollution, in between the showers the air's been clear and fresh. I've had more time on the ski slope than the beach but I've also been out walking the hills and trekking the canyons taking in the beautiful transformation.

Los Angeles is rarely recognised as a pretty city but when the rain stops and the clouds part it really has looked its best. And on the hills that rise from Lake Elsinore, about an hour away, Walker Canyon has been smothered with a blanket of bright orange poppies. They call this the super bloom. It happens most years, but few can remember it being so colourful, so vibrant and so widespread.

There were queues right down the freeway to take a look. The police had to block roads and divert drivers into a shopping centre car park where they were put on shuttle buses back to the canyon. I met a couple who travelled more than 400 miles (650 km from Utah. The crowds rivalled Disneyland, one reporter exclaimed. The portaloos overflowed and the fleet of ice cream vans was selling out fast as finally the sun shone and things began to warm up.
The orange coated hillsides were quickly covered in people desperate to capture this curious event, posing for pictures of themselves rolling amongst the poppies. Eventually the authorities had to restrict access as the crowds grew unmanageable and the flowers were getting damaged. And the tourists weren't the only ones flocking. Millions of butterflies have been migrating through the state.

Numbers of the Painted Lady butterflies hit an all-time low last year but now they're back, fluttering streams of brown and orange, skipping on the breeze over the hills and through the suburbs of LA.

Like the poppies, the butterflies might feel like a sign the dry times are over. But no-one's under any illusions here. This state still faces massive issues with water conservation, the drought risk and the threat of more deadly wildfires. 
And as I write this it's started raining again. The rumble of thunder has been a familiar sound here so far this year. It may not be what I'd hoped for but it has done something to redress nature's delicate balance.

Three months ago, eight people disappeared on a flight deep in the Amazon. Small planes are often the only way to get around - but because most landing strips are unofficial, pilots have to lie about where they are flying. And this means that when planes go missing, it can be unclear where to look for them.

Nina Chestney,"LONDON/INCHEON (Reuters) - Society would have to carry out “unprecedented” changes to the way it operates to keep global temperatures from rising by less than targeted or it risks increases in heat waves and flood-causing storms and the chances of drought in some regions, a U.N. report said on Monday. Keeping the Earth’s temperature rise to only 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) rather than the 2C target agreed to at the Paris Agreement talks in 2015, would have “clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems,” the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said on Monday in a statement announcing the report’s release. The IPCC report said at the current rate of warming, the world’s temperatures would likely reach 1.5C between 2030 and 2052 after an increase of 1C above pre-industrial levels since the mid-1800s. Keeping the 1.5C target would keep the global sea level rise 0.1 meter (3.9 inches) lower by 2100 than a 2C target, the report states. That could reduce flooding and give the people that inhabit the world’s coasts, islands and river deltas time to adapt to climate change. The lower target would also reduce species loss and extinction and the impact on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems, the report said. “Every extra bit of warming matters, especially since warming of 1.5C or higher increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes, such as the loss of some ecosystems,” Hans-Otto Pörtner, who leads one of the IPCC’s working groups, said in the statement. The IPCC met last week in Incheon, South Korea to finalize the report, prepared at the request of governments in 2015 to assess the feasibility and importance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. The report is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement during the Katowice Climate Change Conference in Poland in December. To contain warming at 1.5C, manmade global net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach “net zero” by mid-century. Any additional emissions would require removing CO2 from the air. UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE The report summary said renewable energy would need to supply 70 percent to 85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit, compared with about 25 percent now. Using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the share of gas-fired power would need to be cut to 8 percent and coal to under 2 percent. There was no mention of oil in this context in the summary. If the average global temperature temporarily exceeded 1.5C, additional carbon removal techniques would be required to return warming to below 1.5C by 2100. But the report said the efficacy of measures, such as planting forests, bioenergy use or capturing and storing CO2, were unproven at a large scale and carried some risks. But the effects of not meeting the 1.5C target would mean huge changes to the world. The lower level would mean the Arctic Ocean would be free of sea ice in summer only once per century not at least once a decade under the higher target. Coral reefs would decline by a still unsustainable 70 percent to 90 percent instead of being virtually wiped out under the higher increase. “The report shows that we only have the slimmest of opportunities remaining to avoid unthinkable damage to the climate system that supports life as we know it,” said Amjad Abdulla, the IPCC board member and chief negotiator for an alliance of small island states at risk of flooding as sea levels rise.

THOMAS FULLER and MAX WHITTAKER,"One of the trees in the grove, the Grizzly Giant, a massive, battered and gangly sequoia, is estimated to be 1,800 years old (“plus or minus a few centuries,” according to the National Park Service). Early last week, just a few days before visitors were welcomed back into the grove, a deer was calmly enjoying the shade of the trunk, which measures nearly 100 feet in circumference, one-third of a football field’s length. Partly financed with a $20 million gift from the Yosemite Conservancy, a private philanthropic organization, the renovation involved ripping up nearly an acre and a half of pavement near the trees where cars and trams would pass and replacing it with walking paths made of packed dirt held together with resin. Visitors are now encouraged to take a free shuttle bus from a new parking lot a 10-minute drive away (there is still some handicapped parking at the grove itself). The clanging, smoke-spewing diesel trams which previously took visitors on a tour of the grove have been removed. “We are not trying to take away anyone’s freedom,” said Scott Gediman, a spokesman for the park. “Take your car, but then park it. And walk.” With bark that can be more than one foot thick and high levels of tannins to repel insects, giant sequoias are regarded by experts as some of the world’s most resilient trees. Close to 130 million trees of other species died in California over the past decade after being weakened by a five-year drought, but no mature giant sequoias perished, according to Sue Beatty, a restoration ecologist who helped lead the project. Even so, Ms. Beatty and other experts said they saw some signs of stress in the sequoias.","After a three-year restoration project, the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias in Yosemite National Park has reopened, with less asphalt and more concern for the health of the trees.",2018-06-18T09:00:12Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",A Renewed View of Some of the World’s Oldest Trees,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/us/yosemite-sequoia-mariposa-grove.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/16/us/00yosemite-01/00yosemite-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,drought,1

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"My apologies to anyone who doesn’t happen to live in the Northeastern United States. I don’t want you to feel bad for us. But I do want you to recognize the fact that we’ve been walloped with four enormous snowstorms in three weeks. Adding insult to injury, the most recent one occurred the day after spring “began.” Perhaps this GIF will properly illustrate what we dealt with: For those of you who don’t often look at maps, that’s the southern two-thirds of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Northern Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio. On March 18th, they are all mostly snow-free with the exception of Western New York and the Appalachians. On March 22nd, they’re all completely blanketed. NASA’s Aqua satellite took image one, while MODIS ( Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiomete ) took image two. You can pretty clearly see the foot-plus of snow it dropped across the area, including over 16 inches near Washington, DC, and 20 inches on Eastern Long Island, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory. Late-winter/early spring snowstorms aren’t all that rare, despite how badly they suck. And they really do suck: This most recent one left over 90,000 without power, reports NBC. This hell-cycle probably won’t last, though. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) projects a higher probability that much of the US will be warmer than colder this spring, with potential for worsening drought in the southwest, as we’ve reported. However, there’s a greater-than-average chance that the Northeast will be wetter than normal. Also, climate change or whatever, etc. Anyway, hopefully spring has really begun now, and this will be the last time you hear people from over here complain about the weather.

PENN BULLOCK,"Potatoes can tolerate cold, drought and poor soil, and need less water, fertilizer, pesticide and labor. Since the 1990s, China has outstripped all other countries in production.
Potatoes are hardly new to China. They were introduced about 400 years ago, and feature in beloved regional dishes, like the shredded Sichuan specialty called tudousi.
But for starch, Chinese consumers prefer rice and noodles.
One workaround is to process the tubers into potato flour, which is then mixed with wheat flour to make steamed bread, noodles and cakes. The government also promotes regional potato dishes, and supports the production of fries and potato chips.

CHARLES McDERMID,"“This is the time when evil is on the land, when dogs and snakes must be watched with special care and when all living things seem to wilt under some baleful influence.” So said a 1975 article in The Times, fulsomely describing the dog days of summer. The term originated in ancient times, linked not to humankind’s best friend, but marking when Sirius, the Dog Star, began rising at dawn. (In the U.S., according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac, the dog days begin today.) It was once believed that Sirius combined forces with the sun to create midsummer’s intense heat. The dog days have often been associated with ill fortune. The Roman poet Virgil described in the Aeneid how Sirius, “bringer of drought and plague to frail mortals, rises and saddens the sky with sinister light.” Pure superstition, right? In 2009, a Finnish study tested folklore saying wounds are more infection-prone during this time. “This study was conducted in order to challenge the myth that the rate of infections is higher during the dog days,” the authors wrote. “To our surprise the myth was found to be true.” The dog days end partway through August. Until then, avoid sharp objects.

CORAL DAVENPORT,"The White House memo notes that multiple scientific and defense reports have recently concluded that climate change poses a significant threat to national security, but it casts doubt on those reports, saying, these scientific and national security judgments have not undergone a rigorous independent and adversarial peer review to examine the certainties and uncertainties of climate science, as well as implications for national security. 
Earlier this month, the director of national intelligence released its 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment, which concluded that Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond. Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security.
The report listed specific threats posed by climate change, such as the threat of rising sea levels to the safety of low-lying military installations and the likelihood that increased drought and flooding could lead to mass human displacement and increased conflict. The report concluded that climate-driven food shortages could increase the risk of social unrest, migration, and interstate tension in countries such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq and Jordan.

MIRIAM JORDAN,"Thanks to its mild climate and rich soil, Ventura County produces a variety of crops all year. In the plains around Oxnard, Calif., the vast strawberry fields have been spared from the fires. But thousands of immigrants toiling in the fields initially lacked masks to protect them from the thick, acrid smoke that wafted across the county. Volunteers have descended on the fields to hand out masks since last week. “We have been moving mask distributors up and down the coast,” said Lucas Zucker, policy director of the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, known as Cause. The California Strawberry Commission has urged workers to wear masks, and some growers have distributed them. One 44-year-old farmworker from Mexico who gave his name as Alfonzo said he worked without a proper mask before Cause gave him one. “My throat was aching, but I have my family to support and the rent to pay,” said Alfonzo, who earns $10.50 an hour in the fields. Ventura County growers are used to Santa Ana winds, and many have lost crops before, mainly to frost. But they said they were surprised to see wildfires so close to the ocean and so late in the year, which highlights the severity of a yearslong drought. “This is a complete game-changer for a lot of us,” said Leslie Leavens, a fourth-generation farmer whose family grows avocados and lemons on 800 acres in Ventura Country. As for Ms. Brokaw, she said she was confident that the majority of her trees would survive, even if there are barely any avocados for her to sell this year. “The orchard can be rejuvenated,” she said. “We are committed to this, long-term.” Continue reading the main story",The largest of the fires has damaged a portion of the harvest in the country’s most productive region for both crops.,2017-12-14T00:10:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",More Victims of the California Wildfires: Avocados and Lemons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/us/california-fires-avocados.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/14/us/14avocados-promo/14avocados-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,drought,1
Michael Hardy,"Philadelphia utilizes sand filtration. Los Angeles? Aeration discs. Almost every city uses waste-eating microorganisms. The Clean Water Act of 1972 mandated that every municipality in America must clean its sewage before discharging the water back into rivers, lakes, or the ocean. Today, there are around 16,000 publicly owned wastewater treatment plants in operation across the country, all of them responsible for transforming what we flush down the toilet into something usefulor at least something not actively harmful.
Chicago-based photographer Brad Temkin became interested in water treatment infrastructure while working on a previous project about rooftop gardens. One of the purposes of such gardens is to absorb rainwater, thus reducing runoff and street flooding. That got him wondering what happens to all the rainwater that isn't captured, which led him to ask permission to photograph Chicago's network of underground water tunnels. The more Temkin learned about water, the more he wanted to know. ""We take it for granted,"" he says. ""It's the most valuable resource we have, outside of air, and we just assume that it's always going to be there.""
Temkin's quest led him to photograph water treatment systems across the country including Atlanta, Houston, Phoenix, and Seattle. Each city faces a different set of challenges. In Houston, it's all about flood prevention, while for Phoenix, currently enduring its 19th straight year of drought, it's all about maintaining the water level in its aquifer. Because most water infrastructure is underground, few people ever see it; Temkin had to get special permission from each city to photograph their facilities. Photographing in sewers required its own set of precautions, including an oxygen meter and gas mask in case of emergencies. When he was near running water or an open manhole he had to wear a harness.
The photographer found himself drawn to the unusual architecture of these underground tunnels and cisterns. ""All my pictures are about making an interesting image first, and then hopefully saying something,"" he says. For their part, many water sanitation workers seemed gratified that someone was shining a spotlight on their industry. ""I had people thank me for showing this world that they see everyday. They're excited about it.""
Although a book of the photographs will be published in April by Radius, Temkin says the series is ongoing. He hopes to photograph water infrastructure in San Diego, Israel, and possibly even further afield. A committed environmentalist, he's less interested in highlighting threats to the natural world than potential solutions. ""For all the bad things that are happening, I think we're at our best when facing a problem,"" he says. ""I'm more interested in how we fix things than in how we screw them up.""

Jessica Conditt,"With more data than ever and a rapidly evolving ecosystem, the Fourth National Climate Assessment lays out in clear, authoritative terms how humans are driving global warming, how its dangers are manifesting in our everyday lives, and how much worse it could become in the future. Here's how it begins: Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future -- but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur. The report lays out a handful of current catastrophes caused by climate change, including drought in the Colorado River Basin and Nebraska, dying coral reefs off the coasts of Hawaii, heavy flooding in Louisiana, unprecedented rain damaging farms across the Midwest, massive fires in the Northwest, and hurricanes in Texas. All of these disasters were catalyzed by human-driven climate change. No question. However, Light and other experts are still struggling to convince some people that climate change is a reality. Some people, like the President of the United States. ""It's a sense of frustration that we continue to have to fight yesterday's battles over and over and over again,"" Light said. President Donald Trump denies climate change as a fact, consistently calling into question the science behind global warming and undermining the authority of researchers in the field. Under Trump, the US has withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement (an international accord to curtail global warming), dismantled the Clean Power Plan (an Obama-era mandate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants), and unwoven clean-air proposals handled by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Trump administration was congressionally mandated to release the Fourth National Climate Assessment, and it did so on Black Friday, a chaotic day of full-bore capitalism and post-Thanksgiving coma observed across the country. Many climate scientists saw this move as an attempt to bury the report. On top of that, Trump tweeted the following message on November 21st, two days before the report's publication: ""Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?"" Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2018 ""Which is a fundamental mistake,"" Light said. ""There's been decades of trying to educate people that there's a difference between climate and weather.... One can't help but feeling disheartened when the President of the United States, who has access to the hundreds of government scientists that produced this report -- this is his government. He has access to them and there isn't any reason he should be making mistakes like that."" The Fourth National Climate Assessment isn't designed to make policy recommendations, and it doesn't. It's a comprehensive, apolitical investigation of climate change backed by more than 300 scientists, and it's also a warning. If steps aren't taken to slow the effects of climate change, the US can expect bigger fires, heavier floods, more destructive hurricanes, and all of the negative social consequences that come with. The report describes the future as follows: Climate change threatens to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities that result in higher exposure and sensitivity to extreme weather and climate-related events and other changes. Marginalized populations may also be affected disproportionately by actions to address the underlying causes and impacts of climate change, if they are not implemented under policies that consider existing inequalities. Unchecked, global warming poses dozens of threats to life on Earth, from rising sea levels and melting ice caps, to devastating drought, fire, famine and disease. Light called out a handful of real climate-change effects that are at the forefront of his mind, playing out right now: intense, long-lasting heat waves that pose a danger to people without access to air conditioning, and extreme rainfall making it more difficult for crops to grow in the Midwest. ""We can attribute the wider spread of certain kinds of diseases, especially tropical diseases and vector diseases, foodborne and waterborne diseases, toward changes in the climate,"" Light said. ""And this is a slowly but nonetheless increasingly unfolding public health crisis that is not terribly well acknowledged, but I think that all of us have to be more concerned about and we know will get worse as we move forward."" ""We don't have that leadership at the federal level right now."" While the federal government drags its feet on addressing climate change, states and cities are stepping up with clean-air protections of their own. For instance, the US is on track to uphold its obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement, due in part to efforts by the United States Climate Alliance, a bipartisan group of 17 governors committed to seeing the accord through a reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. ""We can avoid the worst scenarios and impacts that we talk about in the report, but it is something that's going to require a lot of more effort,"" Light said. ""We've got great leadership coming out of California in particular, but also more than a dozen other states, hundreds of cities, thousands of businesses, but we don't have that leadership at the federal level right now. That's the part where we have a lot of improvement we can still do."" The Fourth National Climate Assessment is clear. It doesn't inject politics into its science, and it doesn't mince words -- even in the introduction, which closes as follows: [The Fourth National Climate Assessment] concludes that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans' physical, social, and economic well-being are rising. These impacts are projected to intensify -- but how much they intensify will depend on actions taken to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the risks from climate change now and in the coming decades.","Hurricane Katrina claimed nearly 2,000 lives when it struck the Gulf Coast of the United States in 2005, submerging New Orleans in floodwater and devastating the region for more than a decade.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Californias 2018 is officially the worst year for wildfires in recorded state history, the Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday, citing the National Interagency Coordination Centers year-end statistical analysis. The 1.8 million acres of California land that burned last year was more than any other state in 2018, and it far surpassed 2017's tally of 1.3 million acres in California. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean confirmed to the Times that the wildfires were unprecedented.
The Times wrote:
More than 100 people were killed and 17,000 homes and 700 businesses were destroyed in a state where fires are considered one of the annual seasons. Crews responded to more than 8,000 fires last year.
Its a surprise its that amount, but in a sense because of what Ive seen over the last year, no its not, McLean said. Its what weve been living through.
... Firefighters said the most devastating blazes had the most extreme behaviorwind-driven ember storms that created spot fires far beyond defensive lines and, in the case of the Carr fire, a fire tornado that ignited objects lifted into the air.
Many of the recorded deaths happened during the Camp Fire, which rampaged across Butte County and killed some 86 people, mainly as it rolled through the town of Paradise and burned most of it to the ground. The Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire, both in November, burned more than 250,000 acres alone, the Times noted.
After a seven-year drought from 2010 to 2017, much of California remains a tinderbox with estimates that there are over 147 million dead trees throughout the state. The end of the drought poses its own problems, as fast-growing grasses and other small plants can dry out and catch flame themselves, carrying blazes right to other sources of fuel. Californias rapidly growing population (which has almost doubled since the 1970s) has also brought many more communities into areas at high risk of fires.
Recent research has also indicated that the historical distinction between the December-February wet season and the fire season has largely disappeared, in part due to climate change.
Last year, Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott told the AP that the state government should consider a ban on building homes in potentially fire-prone areas, saying: Firefighters are living climate change, its staring them in the face everyday. He added that officials owe it to residents and emergency personnel alike to make such decisions, so that they dont have to keep going through what were going through.
California fire officials are planning a major effort to thin forests throughout the state in an effort to stave off future wildfires, but per the San Francisco Chronicle, some experts are questioning whether it will really be enough. Thinning forests reduces available fuel but can also dry out the forest floor or promote growth of less fire-resistant plants, the paper wrote. Denser forests may burn longer, but they may also burn less intensely.
University of California, Santa Barbara UC Cooperative Extension wildfire researcher Max Moritiz told the Chronicle, Its not fair to say that fuel treatments wont do any good. It may provide some protection in some places. But most of us studying this agree that you cant just do this and (expect to) make much headway.
McLean told the paper the efforts may not stop the catastrophic scale of wildfires in recent years, but It gives the folks in those areas time to evacuate and it also give the firefighters a chance to get in there and mitigate the fire.
According to the LA Times, fire officials are bracing for the worst. McLean said that the recent wet winter has promoted even more growth in fuel, saying that its fire management programs have to continue forever. Its an ongoing process from here on out.

Luke Fox,"TORONTO Auston Matthews called it.
Once coach Mike Babcock reinserted the slumping William Nylander on his right side, the Maple Leafs star centre took it upon himself to play monkey exterminator.
""Hes going to score a goal, and the weight of the world is going to be off his shoulders,"" Matthews accurately predicted Wednesday, ahead of Thursdays matinee versus the Wild.
""I told him Ill definitely be looking for him tomorrow, and I told him to shoot everything.""
And so it was written, that a Nylander-Matthews-Nylander give-and-go on a buttery behind-the-net cycle would see Nylander glide out from behind goalie Devan Dubnyks right blind spot and snap a wrist shot high and clean and only 256 days in the waiting.
""I was like, ‘Oh my God, I cant believe it. Finally.’"" Nylander said post-game. ""There are a couple more things I can do better. But its at least been nice that youre able to get chances when youre not playing at 100 per cent. Because then when you are at 100 per cent, youll be good.""
Riding elation from his first goal of the season, his first in an unlucky 13 games dating back to April and his first point of his past nine outings, snapping the greatest production drought of his career and likely his life Nylander leapt into the arms of a giddy Travis Dermott, un-swallowed himself from a group hug, reached back to his nameplate and threw an imaginary monkey over the glass and deep into Section 323.
""Thats big for him,"" Matthews said, finding a positive after the Maple Leafs squandered the 3-2 lead that Nylander’s marker gave them and fell 4-3 to the Wild. ""He can get goin again.”
Matthews can empathize. Used to lighting lamps at will, he went 13 games without a goal in his rookie year and still wound up lifting the Calder Trophy.
""I felt like the weight of the world was coming down on me. People were saying trade me and all that stuff. It can definitely weigh on you as a player, as a person,"" Matthews explains.
""But I think once that one comes, you feel that extra jump in your step. Youre back feeling confident and hopefully get back on a roll.""
A 22-year-old with two 20-goal seasons, Nylanders 2018-19 has been anything but the projected giant step in forward progress that a smart exec like Leafs GM Kyle Dubas is banking on. Hes copped to frustration and anger, and over the break had his aunt/hairdresser chop off his flowing locks.
Nylander sat out training camp with a contract impasse you may have read about it, and hes been scrambling ever since to catch up to race in which the other horses were already at full stride and rounding the quartermark as he stepped into the starting gate.
Cringe-watching Nylander bobble pucks and get line-juggled and scuffle to a minus-4 rating on a plus-34 freight train has served as a warning for all involved.
""Its certainly not the way that you want it to play out. You dont want players missing two months of the season plus training camp and exhibition in their preparation time,"" Dubas told Sportsnets TV panel before the game, mindful he cant take a similar if-you-got-time-use-it approach with impending RFAs Matthews and Mitch Marner.
""The inclination is that everyone wants to be patient, everyone wants to take their time, but were wide-open on those. Everyone realizes these are paramount discussions. Both Mitch and Auston bring leadership. Theyre obviously excellent young players, and theyre key, key parts of our franchise, not only on the ice but off the ice.
""Our goal is to get those done as soon as we can and keep an open dialogue with their representatives.""
Though the organization did an excellent job muting expectations for Nylanders true return by pulling out a sports-scientific mid-January timeline, Dubas conceded Thursday that team success helped obscure the underwhelming performance of Torontos new $45-million man.
""Its another case of adversity for William. Luckily, with the team playing the way that it has, its sort of masked that and given him some breathing room,"" Dubas said. ""Well see him on the verge of returning to his usual form.""
To a man, Nylanders teammates have been publicly supportive and patient throughout this four-month process.
""He came to the rink with the attitude every single day of happiness and pure joy,"" Marner says of how Nylander handled the dry spell.
""Its a great relief to him and our team that hes getting on that scoresheet now. Hes found his groove. Now its going to be scary for other teams now we got him back.""
The pressure doesnt suddenly evaporate with one perfectly placed shot.
With great compensation comes great responsibility.
Babcocks promotion of Nylander to the top six which, conversely, demotes a hard-working Kasperi Kapanen to Nazem Kadris perpetually in-flux third line isnt so much a reward of merit as it is a coach doing everything in his quiver to get an important forward engaged.
Nylander ranks just eighth among Leafs forwards in average ice time (15:02) and skates on the seldom-used second power-play unit, and it was telling that with Thursdays points on the line and Leafs goaltender Michael Hutchinson pulled early, Nylander didnt see time 6-on-5.
The ignition has been turned. The gas pedal needs slamming.
""Ideally what [that first goal] is going to do is get him to compete harder, skate harder and take a load off him and get going,"" Babcock said.
""I thought he was going to get the winner here tonight; I thought one was going to be enough. In the end, it wasn’t. That’s all he got.
""We need him to help our team and be a productive Leaf. We think he can be, and it’s just a matter of time.""","William Nylander’s drought serves as a warning for Maple Leafs’ Kyle Dubas Sportsnet.ca Nylander scores but Maple Leafs, Hutchinson lose to Wild NHL.com Leafs vs Wild: GDT and Liveblog Pension Plan Puppets Marner takes all-star snub in stride, will be glad to…",2019-01-04T00:27:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sportsnet.ca'}",William Nylander’s drought serves as a warning for Maple Leafs’ Kyle Dubas - Sportsnet.ca,https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/william-nylanders-drought-serves-warning-maple-leafs-kyle-dubas/,https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/William-Nylander.jpg,,Sportsnet.ca,drought,1
Ainsley Harris,"The tech IPO drought may finally be over–for a certain kind of tech company. Utah-based startup Pluralsight made its public debut this morning, raising $310.5 million at a valuation of nearly $2 billion. The company originally set a price range of $10-$12 per share, later increased that to $12-$14 per share, and then yesterday announced $15 per share pricing. The stock opened on the Nasdaq at $20 per share, a pop of 34%. Two months prior, fellow enterprise technology startup Dropbox saw its shares increase 36% on day one, also trading on the Nasdaq. The stock is now worth over $30 per share, giving Dropbox a valuation of $12.2 billion. Similarly, in April, DocuSign jumped 31% and Zuora nearly 43%. Of the recent enterprise IPOs, Pluralsight and Dropbox operate the most similar business models, leveraging B2C customers to generate interest on the part of more lucrative B2B customers. “When we were out on the road, the investors recognized that immediately,” says Pluralsight cofounder and CEO Aaron Skonnard. “We have this awesome B2C consumer base, we’re helping individuals learn these skills. They take us into their business, and that’s a key part of our go-to-market. And that’s exactly what they heard from Dropbox.” In the end, the offering was more than 20 times oversubscribed. The central difference between Pluralsight and other enterprise tech companies is the importance of Pluralsight’s outward facing talent. The company offers customers access to a library of technology courses, covering topics including front-end web development, data science, and security. Each course is taught by a contracted industry expert, who is paid according to the course’s popularity. (Some instructors have earned upwards of $1 million.) Yet Skonnard chooses to distance Pluralsight from “education” or “edtech” labels, and investors have endorsed that distinction. “This is ongoing professional skills enablement. It’s more like we’re embedded in their product problems, we’re part of that supply chain to deliver the innovation for the company,” he says. “That’s also why we also don’t compete with the bootcamps or the MOOCs, because they’re bringing people into the [tech] industry. Our customer is more the CTO and the CIO.” By focusing on existing employees of large companies, Pluralsight has avoided the fate of education startups like Dev Bootcamp and Iron Yard, both of which shut down last year. MOOCs, in turn, have become useful classroom tools, but only mildly successful businesses. 2U, which operates online graduate programs and recently teamed up with WeWork, is one of the industry’s few bright spots. Pluralsight’s business, in contrast, does not hinge on a high-stakes, binary outcome like a hiring decision. Instead, the company promises to increase employees’ technology skills over time, and give senior managers tools to evaluate their teams’ strengths and weaknesses. Skonnard cites, by way of example, Pluralsight’s relationship with Barclays. A 19-year-old coder at the London-based bank, self-taught via Pluralsight, caught the eye of executives when he developed a Siri-driven mobile app. The bank signed a contract for 1,500 licenses, upped the count to 7,800 licenses the following year, and now pays subscription fees to cover 15,000 licenses. Among Barclays’s technology teams, “We’re about 50% penetrated,” he says. Now he’ll have to repeat that success at dozens more companies. Pluralsight has a presence in roughly two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies, but is only 5% penetrated in those accounts. The runway, Skonnard says, is “huge.” Pluralsight was founded in 2004. After initially bootstrapping the company, Skonnard raised $27.5 million in Series A funding in 2013, and $135 million in Series B funding the year after. Former U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan sits on the company’s board.","Enterprise tech startups are a hit with investors, while Snap and other consumer tech companies flounder.

Eleanor Beardsley,"Dairy farmer Dominique Rochat says the Swiss government's water deliveries have allowed him to keep his cows in the high mountains. Eleanor Beardsley/NPR There's a distinct sound to summertime in Switzerland. I first heard it driving up a winding mountain road at night. A curious tinkling sound was coming from the darkness around me. It got louder and closer, until I realized it was the clanging of cow bells in the surrounding pastures. For centuries, between late May and early October, dairy farmers have been bringing their cows up to graze in the high mountain pastures. But this summer, because of a severe drought in July and August, cows grazing in mountain pastures haven't had enough to drink. So water has been delivered to them. Dairy farmer Dominique Rochat, who has 110 cows, says the grass is succulent up here at 4,500 feet. Rochat spends the summer with his cows, staying in his 17th-century chalet. He says the tradition of grazing cows in the high pastures in summer also gives farmers a chance to harvest enough hay in the plains below for their cows in winter. But this summer could have been a disaster, says Rochat. ""A milk cow can drink 40 to 50 gallons a day, so my herd consumes up to 1,300 gallons a day up here when it's hot,"" he says. ""But our government reacted just in time with these water deliveries, because it's allowing us to keep our cows in the high mountains through the end of the season."" Rochat says that's doubly important during this drought, because there is no hay to spare from a sparser than usual harvest down below. Rochat's chalet is about an hour's drive north of Lausanne, up a narrow, twisting mountain road much too perilous for a water truck. So he gets water deliveries by helicopter. This morning's delivery, which I've come specifically to witness, is cancelled at the last minute due to fog. But Rochat shows me a video he took of last week's delivery on his cell phone. He says the Swiss army helicopter scooped 2,000 gallons from Lake Neuchatel in a giant red bag, then flew it up the mountainside. ""Look, it's spectacular,"" he says, pointing to the screen. ""The way the pilot lowers the copter down and the vigilance of the people on the ground who control the water bag so we can fill up my cistern. It's not something you see every day around here!"" But water deliveries by helicopter and truck are taking place almost every day in Switzerland this August. Traditionally, farmers collect rain water and snow-melt in cisterns for use in summer months. You see the centuries-old round stone cisterns near every chalet. But that system was no match for the scorching heat wave this year. According to the Swiss weather service, July and August 2018 are the driest on record since 1921, while recent temperatures haven't been so consistently hot since the 1880s. ""In the 20 th century, heat waves of this intensity would occur once in 10 or 15 years,"" says Martin Beniston, a climatologist who recently retired from the University of Geneva. ""And now we've had like four or five since the big 2003 heat wave. Things are changing rapidly, as if we are having a northward shift of the Mediterranean climate to north of the Alps."" This summer, because of a severe drought in July and August, cows grazing in Swiss mountain pastures haven't had enough to drink. Eleanor Beardsley/NPR Jean Claude Pittet is a second-generation dairy farmer. He hopes to pass his dairy business on to his son. But with the increasingly frequent droughts, he says he doesn't know what's going to happen. ""I don't know if my son will be able to do this his whole life like my father and I have,"" says Pittet. Pittet and his wife, Mireille, are driving their tractor up to even higher pastures where one of their cows has given birth. The couple says luckily they have been able to get water delivered by truck this summer. Mireille points to where the rainwater is collected in gutters along the slanted roofs of the chalet and funneled to the cistern. She says usually it's enough. But not this year. ""We would have really had problems without those water deliveries,"" she says. Around the back of their chalet, the couple's cows are milked twice a day inside a small barn. They sell double-cream butter and the famous Gruyère, or Swiss cheese, in a front room. Eric Treboux, a forest ranger in the Swiss canton [or state] of Vaud, says repercussions of the water shortage go beyond cows. ""Switzerland is known as the water tower of Europe, because we have the Alps with all of the glaciers,"" says Treboux. ""Snow melt and runoff from the glaciers feed rivers like the Rhone, the Rhine, the Po and the Danube. Europe's major rivers all have their source here in Switzerland."" Treboux says less snow and receding glaciers will continue to affect agriculture. But the phenomenon will also influence other activities dependent on those rivers, like tourism and hydroelectric power. Climatologist Beniston says melting glaciers are probably the most obvious evidence of rapid climate warming. ""We know that the Swiss Alpine glaciers have lost one third of their volume since the beginning of the 20th century,"" he says. Beniston says as temperatures heat up, as much as 90 percent of the glaciers could disappear by the end of this century. ""If the glaciers would disappear entirely, it would have major implications for seasonality and the quantity of water flowing from the Alps and supplying low-lying areas in France, Germany, Holland and central and northern Italy,"" he says. Back at Rochot's mountain chalet, I meet Jacques Henchoz, director of agriculture for Vaud. He tells me the Swiss are a nation of herders. ""Our agriculture economy is based primarily on grazing and milk and cheese production,"" he says. ""But with the weather getting hotter and drier over the last 20 years, things are changing."" Henchoz says providing water in the high pastures for dairy cows is going to be the biggest challenge facing Swiss farmers this century.",Water scarcity and heat are threatening two of Switzerland's main agricultural products: milk and cheese.

"AP, AP","Joey Logano holds the trophy after winning the NASCAR Cup Series Championship auto race at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Homestead, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (Photo: The Associated Press) HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) Ford slammed the door on NASCAR's longest championship drought when Joey Logano drove a Fusion to victory in its final race. Logano won Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway to give the American automaker its eighth drivers' title, but first since Kurt Busch in 2004. Ford also won the manufacturers' title, the first time it has won the top two prizes in NASCAR in a season since 1999. Ford had two of the four entries in the championship field, one each from Team Penske and Stewart-Haas Racing, the teams it recruited to end its championship slide. The crown went to Roger Penske, a longtime Ford supporter and friend of Edsel Ford II, grandson of Henry Ford. ""Delivering the manufacturers' championship and the driver's championship, where it's been a drought for them and for Edsel,"" Penske said, ""and all the people that have done so much at Ford, and they've stayed committed with us. This is part of building a brand."" Penkse and Edsel Ford shared the championship moment in victory lane. Team Penske returned to the Ford brand in 2013 and has been the cornerstone of the blue oval groups bid to challenge Chevrolet and Toyota for tops in NASCAR. ""It means a lot to me personally to have both the drivers' and manufacturers' championship,"" Ford said. ""It has been since 1999 and I was there with Robert Yates and Dale Jarrett. Doing it again, 19 years later, it is absolutely indescribable to me."" Ford led all three manufacturers with 19 wins in 2018, including eight by Kevin Harvick, four by Brad Keselowski, three by Logano, two by Clint Bowyer and one from Aric Almirola and Kurt Busch. ""This means so much for Ford Motor Company and all of our employees that work so hard,"" said Mark Rushbrook, global director for Ford Performance. ""I just can't believe this right now. We have worked so hard for the last three years to build up the program and to have this 2018 season and have 19 wins, the manufacturers' championship and the drivers' championship.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A firefighter was killed on Saturday while battling a wildfire burning near Yosemite National Park, California state fire officials said, bringing to at least 10 the number of such deaths this year as wildfires rage across the U.S. West. Braden Varney was killed on the fireline while operating a bulldozer at the Ferguson Fire early this morning, said Scott Maclean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). Further details on Varney’s death were not immediately available. “The winds are really erratic, there’s just no moisture in the vegetation, it is still so dry regardless of what rains we’ve had,” Maclean said. Varney was using the bulldozer to try to hold back a blaze that has burned 150 acres (61 hectares) in rugged, inaccessible forest near Savage Trading Post, some 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Yosemite in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains and about 140 miles (225 km) east of San Francisco. Nine U.S. wildland firefighters had been killed up to Tuesday as the United States faced another extreme year for wildfires, according to National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) data. Fourteen wildland firefighters died in all of 2017 when the United States suffered its second worst wildfire year on record, with 10 million acres (4 million hectares) blackened. Varney worked for CalFire. The last CalFire firefighter to die was in December 2017 on the Thomas Fire, the largest in California’s history and one of a rash of blazes that destroyed thousands of homes and killed 43 people in the state. Nearly all of California faces abnormally dry or drought conditions, even though the state’s historic 2012-2017 drought is officially over, according to the Drought Monitor agency. The state has had its worst start to the fire period in a decade, with 220,421 acres burned through Thursday morning, according to NIFC data. U.S. wildfires have already burned more than 3.3 million acres this year, more than the year-to-date average of about 3 million acres in the past 10 years, according to the NIFC tracking website. As the summer continues, the risk of large wildfires is set to reach normal levels in much of the Southwest and Rocky Mountain areas, thanks to strong summer rains, but risk levels will remain above normal in California through at least October, according to NIFC data.

Mr Macron said the tree would be a reminder of ""these ties that bind us"". But a Reuters photographer on Saturday took a shot of only a yellow patch of grass on the White House south lawn where the tree once stood. The tree, a European sessile oak, came from the site of the Battle of Belleau Wood, which took place in the summer of 1918. Nearly 2,000 US soldiers died in the battle north-east of Paris.

Mark Kaufman,"A triple whammy of disease, climate change, and deforestation has threatened around 60 percent of the planet's wild coffee species. While this hasn't yet imperiled the world's coffee supply, it jeopardizes your favorite coffee's resiliency in the face of profound planetary change.  
In new research published Wednesday in Science Advances, botanists and plant researchers determined that 75 of 124 wild coffee species are now threatened with extinction, based upon widely-used International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria. For the coffee drinker, this matters:  Experts emphasize that wild species hold the key to maintaining a healthy, vibrant, and flavorful coffee supply.
""The coffee we drink today exists because of access to wild species,"" Aaron Davis, the senior research leader for Plant Resources at The Royal Botanical Gardens Kew and lead author of the study, said in an interview. 
One of the two most popular coffee species that everyone drinks today, robusta, was barely even known until the early 1900s. It was just a wild species, growing in remote forests.
""It went from being almost unknown to being a major global commodity that's amazing,"" said Davis.
Wild Arabica coffee.

Like most every food commodity, coffee today is grown on farms. But its wild predecessors exist in specific regions, like Ethiopia and Sudan. And these regions are being hit hard. 
In 2012, Davis and other coffee researchers visited south Sudan, the only place outside of Ethiopia that hosts the wild species of Arabica, which accounts for 60 to 70 percent of the world's coffee. Seventy years previous, coffee collectors had journeyed to this Sudanese land. They wrote that it teemed with wild coffee plants. 
But things have changed.

""It was dry as a bone the landscape completely changed over 70 years,"" Hanna Neuschwander, the director of communications for World Coffee Research, an industry-funded agricultural organization for coffee, said in an interview. 
There were few older plants and young seedlings there, said Davis, who noted the area has also been hit with deforestation.
""It's under huge pressure,"" he said. ""If that [deforestation] carries on for another 10 years, there will be nothing left.""
Losing these wild plant species some of which haven't been seen in 100 years wipes out a valuable gene pool that can be used to create coffee breeds with the ability to fend off the warming climate and the spreading of disease, which is already an established threat.

""The coffee industry is invariably going to face challenges that were aware of, and potentially challenges that we dont know exist yet,"" said Neuschwander. ""If you dont have those wild species protected, you have probably crippled your ability to address the problem because you just don't have the genetic toolkit.""
Similar to many crops, like the essential ingredients in beer, the farmed coffee today is especially vulnerable to two of the most-well predicted and currently-unfolding consequences of climate change, increased heat and drought. 
""Increasing greenhouse gases are warming the planet and changing patterns of extreme heat and drought,"" Nathan Mueller, an assistant professor of earth system science at the University of California, Irvine who researches global food security, said over email.
""As farmers are increasingly exposed to new climate conditions and changing pest pressures, the genetic diversity of wild crop relatives may be essential to breeding new coffee varieties that can withstand these pressures,"" Mueller, who was not involved with the study, added.
Both Arabica and robusta which comprise nearly all the world's store-bought coffee don't tolerate low moisture or drought. And Arabica doesn't do well in hotter than normal temperatures, noted Davis. 
Due to climate change, previous research found that wild Arabica may go extinct in around 60 years.
""It's a longer term threat but its shorter term than some people might imagine,"" said Neuschwander. ""Itsounds far away, but thats in my lifetime,"" she added.

A critical conservation solution, though, would be to preserve the wild coffee seeds (and genes) in seed banks or collections. The researchers found that around 55 percent of wild species are preserved in gene banks. But but that doesn't yet provide relief, simply because these few seed banks aren't yet reliable, complete, or well-funded.
""Some of them literally just have handwritten notes on paper about the varieties they have in their collection,"" said Neuschwander.
The massive coffee industry knows it must address the problem, which could cost over $20 million dollars, she noted.
But such is the reality in a coffee world threatened by disease, pestilence, and accelerating climate change.

During his 1984 reporting trip to Mali, Burkina Faso and Ethiopia, he explored the devastating impact of the drought and subsequent famine. Later, while covering Haitis earthquake in 2010, he was unsettled by scenes of death and destruction. He approached it carefully, figuring out how to show something horrific had happened, but avoiding broken and bloodied corpses.
There seems to be some racial imbalance when it comes to covering people of color in that situation as opposed to covering folks who were killed in Paris, he said. You just dont see something comparable in white enclaves.

Mark Kaufman,"Some 10,000 years ago, after the frigid Ice Age ended, humans tamed the nutritious grain, barley. It blossomed in a fertile realm of early civilization spanning contemporary states like Israel, Palestine, Jordan and beyond. Then 5,000 years later, peoples in the Zagros Mountains of modern-day Iran learned to brew barley beer. Today, farmers globally harvest tens of millions of tons of the crop each month. But barley, like many crops, has a flaw: Its yields plummet during heat waves and drought both extreme consequences of a warming planet. As a primary ingredient in beer, this poses a real threat to the future global supply of frothy ales, lagers, and stouts. The extremes are detrimental to just about every crop but barley is near and dear to just about everyone or at least people who like beer, Collin Watters, the head of the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee, a state organization, said in an interview. And new research published this week supports Watters' barley observations. Barley ready for harvest. Image: U.S. Department of Agriculture/Bill scruggs A group of scientists from the United States, United Kingdom, and China have now forecast how barley harvests would be disrupted by different climate scenarios this century, which are dependent on how much heat-trapping greenhouse gases modern civilization pumps into Earths atmosphere. In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Plants, the researchers conclude that if greenhouse emissions continue unchecked (often called business as usual), barley harvests will drop by 17 percent by the century's end. Textbook economic consequences would follow. With a choked barley supply and burgeoning population, beer prices would catapult: Todays average six-pack in the U.S. would cost more than $20, the researchers found. Beer prices would be jacked up by nearly 200 percent, or perhaps more, in stout-quaffing Ireland. Prices really skyrocket in a high-emissions world, Nathaniel Mueller, a study coauthor who researches how environmental change influences agricultural systems at the University of California Irvine, said in an interview. Barley has historically flourished under a stable and temperate climate system. But with temperature and heat extremes now increasingly stoked by the highest carbon dioxide levels on the planet in at least 800,000 years, both farmers and barley have real vulnerabilities. SEE ALSO: Why scientists think cows could be the largest animals on land in 300 years At the end of the day, were really dependent upon favorable weather conditions, and farmers have located in places where conditions tend to be favorable, said Mueller. As the climate changes around them, theyll be increasingly exposed to these extreme events. And when it comes to the future reckoning of droughts and heat waves, the science is strong. We have a high certainty of how things are changing, Andreas Prein, who researches climate and weather extremes at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an interview. Prices really skyrocket in a high emissions world With higher temperatures, the worlds water cycle experiences more extremes. This is already occurring all over the U.S., in the south, California, the desert southwest, and beyond. You get strong rainfall in extremes, or you get nothing, said Prein, who had no role in the study. Floods and droughts both are not good for farmers."" The vulnerability of barley The problem isnt simply that barley harvests fall during heat waves and drought. Its that the barley used in beer in a process called malting has to be of a specific, vigilantly grown, high-quality. It really is this special crop that needs a certain set of growing conditions, Watters, who wasn't involved in the study, said. Barley used in beer-making, for example, must be low in protein. Warmer weather, or heat spells at an importune time in the growing process, can mean doom for a beer-worthy crop. Generally, the hotter and drier the climate is, that normally indicates higher protein, said Watters. And that is bad for making beer. Its more complicated than just a loss of production, he added. Malted barley ready for brewing beer. Image: u.S. Department of Agriculture A spell of drought hit Montana barley farmers in 2017. Around June 1, it was like someone just turned off the spigot, and we didnt have rain for months, said Watters. Farmers with irrigation were able to contend with the dryness, but pumping water is hugely expensive, and it cant always be relied upon. Its a finite resource, said Watters. Barley isnt alone in requiring specific, consistent growing conditions. The coffee bean has already been hit with similar, well-documented struggles. Its not just can you grow coffee somewhere its can you grow good coffee, said Prein. Beer saviors? Future barley crops arent necessarily imperiled yet. For one, the study found that under low greenhouse gas emission scenarios, barley crops and ultimately beer prices are only impacted in minor ways. Accordingly, if global society can dramatically reduce carbon emissions in the next two decades which would require a prompt and politically challenging transition to renewable energy paradigms our beer supply will likely be alright. Its in our hands what future we want to see, said Prein. Whats more, ancient farmers found ways to grow barley under new, unfavorable conditions. Beginning about 5,000 years ago during the onset of the Bronze Age, farmers increasingly left over-populated areas in the modern day Middle East and began to spread north, to colder climes. They persevered, and found a way to successfully grow barley. A lesson from the Bronze Age is that it all depends on how much flexibility the farmers enjoy, Xinyi Liu, an archaeologist at Washington University in St. Louis who researches prehistoric food cultivation, said in an interview. Global climate temperatures in 1884. Blues show cooler than average. Image: nasa Global temperatures in 2017. Yellows and reds show warmer than average. Image: nasa Back then, farmers capitalized upon a diversity of adapted barley varieties, known as landraces. This diversity allowed them to find and develop strains that could withstand new, challenging growing conditions in places like northern Europe and the high-elevation Tibetan Plateau, said Liu. Of course, these were colder, not warmer, environments like the ones we're facing now. Today, however, the industrial agriculture world is largely focused on barley varieties that produce consistently ample harvests as opposed to maintaining biodiverse, potentially adaptable barleys. Were now in an era of the higher yield varieties that means less variety in the overall pool, said Liu. The landraces have been overlooked by the modern scientific progress and so forth, he added. Though, more drought resistant barley varieties are in the works said, Watters. Breeding programs, like those in Montana, try and build in some tolerance to adverse conditions, he said. In the end, if emissions persist as they are and farmers cant adapt, the inevitable solution might be creating beer without barley. We should keep open-minded about what we can use to make beer, said Liu, suggesting other grains like millets. Already, major producers like Budweiser for better or worse depending on ones pallet use rice along with some malted barley to brew copious amounts of beer. The coming decade and beyond will be pivotal in determining the fate of the worlds beer supply, and critically, the future cost of beer. Regardless of our climate path, farming and harvests will continue. And like they have in years past, farmers will still remain largely beholden to the whims of weather but weather that is now unquestionably warming, disrupting the climate, and making things weird. They hope for the best, but anticipate the worst, said Watters.","Some 10,000 years ago, after the frigid Ice Age ended, humans tamed the nutritious grain, barley.

"AP, AP","Kevin Harvick celebrates in Victory Lane after winning the NASCAR All-Star auto race at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., Saturday, May 19, 2018. (AP Photo/Chuck Burton) (Photo: The Associated Press) CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — It's been 16 years since Mark Martin won the Coca-Cola 600, and a Ford driver has not been to victory lane for the marquee event since. A Ford driver hasn't hoisted a Cup championship trophy since 2004, either. There have been some highlights during this past decade of mediocrity, but coming up empty every year in the chase for NASCAR's biggest prize got very tiring to the Ford group. ""Four years ago we got very serious about, 'We don't just want to be here, we want to be here to win,'"" said Mark Rushbrook, global director at Ford Motor Co. ""To do that, we knew we had to fix everything."" Ford Performance was launched along with a technical center created as the headquarters for engineers to assist its teams across multiple series. Its first success came two years later when Ford returned to Le Mans on the 50th anniversary of its 1966 victory and won the GT class. Gains have been made across all Ford's motorsports programs, and the company is currently the hottest manufacturer in NASCAR. Ford has won seven of the 12 Cup points races this season, its 2,296 laps led account for 59 percent and Ford drivers have 17 stage victories. Kevin Harvick is the force behind that success with five Cup victories, including the last two. Add his Saturday night win in the $1 million All-Star race, and Harvick is on a three-race winning streak. That bodes well for Ford in Sunday night's Coca-Cola 600, a race Ford drivers won four consecutive years from 1999-2002. The blue oval has not triumphed in NASCAR's longest race of the year since. Harvick has five of the Ford seven wins this season, and Joey Logano and Clint Bowyer have also been to victory lane. Ford drivers hold seven of the top 10 spots in the Cup standings. Matt Kenseth, who drove a Ford to two Daytona 500 wins and the 2003 championship, returned to the manufacturer earlier this month to help Roush Fenway Racing catch Ford front-runners Stewart-Haas Racing and Team Penske. Logano, winner at Talladega this year, noted Toyota was the dominating brand at this point last season. SHR, in its first year with Ford, wasn't a strong title contender and Penske drivers Logano and Brad Keselowski felt overmatched in their aged Fusions. Ford will move to the Mustang in an update in 2019, but tweaks to the rules package have helped Ford teams catch Toyota. ""Last year, the Toyotas were on fire and really good,"" Logano said. ""I think this year with some of the rules changes and really the way the rules have been regulated, enforced, it has brought it to more of an equal playing field."" Kurt Busch was the last Ford driver to win a Cup title, in the 2004 launch of the playoff system, and it capped consecutive championships for the manufacturer. He believes the commitment from the company has always been the same, from Edsel Ford II on down, but the engineering support has dramatically improved. ""The Ford Performance group, I see it everywhere, with all their different forms of motorsport collaborating together,"" Busch said. ""Whereas Ford Racing before... felt like it was more focused on the NASCAR program and didn't use information from IndyCar or Cosworth in Formula One or sports cars. What I see now is information channels that are able to communicate quickly and gather data from all different branches of motorsports that Ford is involved in."" Ford Performance initially housed a simulator used exclusively by its NASCAR teams. IMSA and WEC programs began using it, and the simulator has graduated into use for both Ford Performance production cars and now mainstream Ford products. To prepare for Le Mans, the drivers from Chip Ganassi Racing drove thousands of miles of Le Mans simulation so that the track would not be foreign when the manufacturer made its ballyhooed return. Ford's sole intent was to celebrate its 50th anniversary victory by winning the race, and with just one test on the track before the 24-hour race, the Tech Center was critical in preparing the program. Ford Performance began with seven engineers in 2013 and now has 45. They are busy preparing the Mustang for Cup introduction next year, and also the Mustang for the Supercars Series in Australia. Rushbrook said Ford Performance is reminded often about its Cup championship drought, and believes the program has nine drivers capable of winning races and contending for the title. Harvick is having a season like Truex did last year in which the championship appears to be his and Ford's to lose, but the Ford program is strong across the board. ""We certainly don't want to be peaking too early,"" said Rushbrook, ""but we are definitely here to win races and championships."" Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Matt Simon,"Travel with me to the year 2100. Despite our best efforts, climate change continues to threaten humanity. Drought, superstorms, flooded coastal cities. Desperate to stop the warming, scientists deploy planes to spray sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere, where it converts into a sulfate aerosol, which reflects sunlight. Thus the planet cools because, yes, chemtrails. It’s called solar geoengineering, and while it’s not happening yet, it’s a real strategy that scientists are exploring to head off climate disaster. The upside is obvious. But so too are the potential perils—not just for humanity, but for the whole natural world. A study out today in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution models what might happen if humans were to geoengineer the planet and then suddenly stop. The sudden spike in global temperature would send ecosystems into chaos, killing off species in droves. Not that we shouldn’t tackle climate change. It’s just that among the many theoretical problems with geoengineering, we can now add its potential to rip ecosystems to shreds. The models in this study presented a scenario in which geoengineers add 5 million tons of sulfur dioxide to the stratosphere, every year, for 50 years. (A half century because it’s long enough to run a good climate simulation, but not too long that it’s computationally unwieldy. The group is planning another study that will look at 100 years of geoengineering.) Then, in this hypothetical scenario, the sulfur seeding just stops altogether—think if someone hacks or physically attacks the system. “You'd get rapid warming because the aerosols have a lifetime of a year or two, and they would fall out pretty quickly,” says study co-author Alan Robock, a climate scientist at Rutgers University. “And then you'd get all this extra sunlight and you'd quickly go back up to what the climate might have been without the geoengineering.” We’re talking a rise in land surface temperatures of almost a degree per decade. “Even if you do it over five years, you're still going to get this rapid warming,” he says. Now, species haven’t survived on Earth for 3.5 billion years by being wilting flowers; if the climate changes slowly, species can adapt to withstand extra heat or cold. But suddenly blast the planet with a massive amount of solar energy that quickly, and you’re liable to catch a species off-guard. And it’s not just temperatures they’d have to adapt to. Dramatic shifts in precipitation would force species to quickly move to new climes or face destruction. Species like amphibians, which are sensitive to temperature and precipitation changes, would have a tough go of it. And of course, not all species have the option of fleeing. Populations of trees and clams and corals would be pretty much kaput. Even if a species is particularly resistant to these changes, the downfall of a keystone species could bring its whole ecosystem crashing down. Take coral, for instance. “If you lose the corals, you lose the species that live within those corals and you lose the species that rely on those species for food,” says John Fleming, a staff scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute who wasn’t involved in the study. “And so it really is an up-the-chain process.” Knowing these risks, it might seem implausible that humans would just suddenly stop geoengineering efforts once they’ve started. Why not just keep pumping sulfur dioxide into the air ad infinitum to keep the planet on life support? Robock explains that the scenario they used isn't definitive—it's just a possible option. And there's a possibility that we might not willingly stop geoengineering. Say the world came together and decided that solar geoengineering is our only hope for survival. Planes start flying over the equator, spraying millions of tons of gas. The planet cools—but alas, this doesn’t affect everyone equally. Some nations might find themselves the beneficiaries of extra precipitation, while others descend into drought. In that situation, a massive country like China or India suffering ill effects could blame the geoengineers and demand they stop. “There is the potential for clubs of countries to wield a lot of power to make a global geoengineering deployment work more for their interests than for less powerful countries,” says lead author Chris Trisos of the University of Maryland. Or maybe the Earth itself plays a wildcard. Volcanoes spew their own sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere all the time; get a big enough eruption and you can send the climate into disarray. That happened in 1815 with the eruption of Mount Tambora, which led to the Year Without a Summer. Or Laki in 1783, which caused famine in India and China because it weakened vital monsoons. “If there was a series of volcanic eruptions that produce a cooling effect, then that might be the reason why people say, ‘Well, actually, we better stop doing the solar engineering,’” says University of East Anglia environmental scientist Phil Williamson, who was not an author of the paper but who penned a companion analysis of it. “And then you get the rebound effect as a result of that.” To be fair, science’s exploration of solar geoengineering is still in its early days. Hell, the technology to do it doesn’t even exist yet. It may well be that scientists find that deploying aerosols is just too risky. Maybe a better idea is 2 CO 2 sequestration. Or marine cloud brightening, as another way to bounce light back into space. But now is the time to start considering the ethical and regulatory pitfalls of pursuing such a strategy. Late last year, Congressman Jerry McNerney introduced a bill that would require the National Academies of Science to produce two reports—one that looks at research avenues and another that looks at oversight. “I hope that we can sooner rather than later figure out what the potential benefits and risks are of doing this geoengineering so society will know whether it's even a possibility,” says Robock. “If not, if it's too dangerous, then it'll put a lot more pressure on us to do mitigation soon rather than later.” “The ultimate fear with geoengineering is that we're trying to alter a system that's much too complex for us to truly predict,” says Fleming. “So doing that can put us in a worse situation than we're in already.” In the meantime, here’s an idea: Let’s dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The whole of life on Earth would certainly appreciate it.","Seeding the atmosphere with sulfur could keep temperature from rising—but once we stop, the backlash could destroy entire species.",2018-01-22T16:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",How Engineering Earth’s Climate Could Seriously Imperil Life,https://www.wired.com/story/how-engineering-earths-climate-could-seriously-imperil-life/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a628d7aa04f826ebb50db99/191:100/pass/frogs-760284233.jpg,wired,Wired,drought,1
Southern California Public Radio,"Amid record-setting heat in the state's south, California's water managers measured the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which supplies water to millions. Department of Water Resources officials trekked to the mountains Thursday to check the snow depth, one gauge of the state's water supply. Snow levels are about one quarter of normal. ""It's not nearly where we'd like to be,"" Frank Gehrke, a state official, acknowledged after carrying out manual measurements of winter snowfall in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Statewide, the snowpack was at about 27 percent of the average for this date. Last year, the Februrary snowpack measurement was 174 percent of normal, said Doug Carlson, Department of Water Resources spokesman. “You can see what a dramatic shift the weather has made since last year,” Carlson said. At the peak of California's recently ended five-year drought, Gov. Jerry Brown ordered 25 percent water conservation in cities and towns and declared a drought emergency. Heavy rains in Northern California last year finally snapped the drought, and Brown declared the emergency over in April. But the drought never really seemed to end in some Southern California areas, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles. Los Angeles received only one significant rain in almost the last 12 months. In Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, which are about 100 miles north of Los Angeles, the lack of rain and dry vegetation were perfect fuel for a December wildfire that grew to be the largest recorded in state history. When it finally rained, the scorched earth turned into deadly mudslides. The most recent weekly U.S. drought monitor, a product of the federal government and others, shows only small patches of the state, in Southern California, in the mildest form of drought. That compares to 2014 and 2015, some of the driest years in history in California, when much of the state was rated as in the most severe categories of drought. In the middle of the state's winter rain and snow season, no rain is in the forecast. In Southern California, ""it really is pretty grim,"" said Swain, who has tracked the stubborn weather patterns blocking rain from the state's south for years. Carlson, spokesman for the state's Department of Water Resources, which carries out the snowpack surveys, said the dry weather is a growing concern, although reservoirs are still fuller than usual thanks to last year's rain in Northern California. Considerations of what constitutes a drought vary, and include: rainfall, the state of waterways, soil dryness, and other measures. Any decision to declare a new drought emergency if the winter remains dry, or later, would be up to Brown. If this winter ends without a generous snowpack up north, Southern California’s large water agencies will use the bumper supply of water they saved from last year’s record rain and snow. The L.A. Department of Water and Power used excess water from the Owens River last year to replenish storage reservoirs and percolate water into underground aquifers. That water can be pumped out and sent south on the L.A. Aqueduct in the coming year. The LADWP also expects to buy more water from the Metropolitan Water District, said DWP Sr. Assistant General Manager Richard Harasick. MWD imports water from Northern California and the Colorado River. Thanks to last year's wet winter, Metropolitan stored a record 1.2 million acre feet. That’s enough to supply the region for a couple of dry years. In a single dry year, the agency would draw down 100,000 to a half-million acre feet, said Metropolitan Senior Engineer Demitri Polyzos. An acre foot is about what three families would us in a year. Despite that buffer, Polyzos said Southern Californians cannot take the stored supply for granted. “We need everyone to do their part and conserve and to continue to conserve. That is how we're going to get through potentially dry consecutive years,” Polyzos said. This story has been updated.","89.3 KPCC California measures the Sierra Nevada snowpack amid dry winter 89.3 KPCC File: The snow survey tube sits in the snow placed there by Frank Gehrke, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program for the Department of Water Resources, after …",2018-02-01T19:46:34Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scpr.org'}",California measures the Sierra Nevada snowpack amid dry winter - 89.3 KPCC,https://www.scpr.org/news/2018/02/01/80377/california-measures-the-sierra-nevada-snowpack-ami/,https://a.scpr.org/i/c1a63b5f37c89e1089f232863885773d/190808-full.jpg,,Scpr.org,drought,1

Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. One of the biggest fires, the Ute Park Fire, has burned 36,083 acres in New Mexico and is only 23 percent contained. A wildfire in southern Colorado, the 416 fire, is now at 2,250 acres and only 10 percent contained. The hottest day of all will be Monday for parts of the Southwest, with highs approaching 110 degrees from Phoenix to Palm Springs, California, and temperatures into the 90s from Denver to Salt Lake City and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Because of such intense heat, an excessive heat warning has been issued for Southern California and Arizona. Also, gusty winds are expected in Nevada and California today. Temperatures in Arizona and Southern California have prompted excessive heat warnings on Monday. Relief from rain in the East An additional 3 to 6 inches of rain fell in the mid-Atlantic states over the weekend -- flooding highways, streets and neighborhoods. Saturated ground, combined with gusty winds, uprooted some trees on top of homes in the Washington, D.C. area. Because of more than 2 feet of rain in the last 30 days in parts of the East, many rivers are rising over of their banks. The Potomac River, northwest of Washington, D.C., is forecast to be in major flood stage later today. It will possibly be at its highest level since the 1990s. The storm system that brought all the rain this weekend is finally moving out this morning. Storms were moving through New York and New England on Monday. The hard-hit areas from Maryland to North Carolina will see minimal rainfall over next few days. Rainfall totals to start the week will be mostly under 1 inch across the Northeast. After a stormy Sunday from New Mexico to Georgia, severe weather will calm down slightly Monday. Tennis ball-sized hail was reported Sunday in western Texas. Winds gusted 60 to 77 mph in parts of central Texas, producing damage yesterday and this morning. Storms continue to fire up this morning in southern and central Texas with flash flooding reported near Austin, where 4 inches of rain has fallen just this morning.

Mark Kaufman,"Americans find modern climate science increasingly convincing, and a damaging mix of exceptional drought, storms, and record-breaking heat is the reason why. 
The results of a new survey conducted in November 2018 by the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute and the research organization The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Researchfound that nearly half of Americans said today's climate science ""is more convincing than five years ago, with extreme weather driving their views.""
Overall, seven in 10 Americans reported that climate change is happening. 
The results of the survey demonstrate that most Americans consider climate change a reality and acknowledge that human activity is at least somewhat responsible, Trevor Tompson, director of The AP-NORC Center, said in a statement. 
The poll gathered responses from just over 1,200 American adults, who were selected randomly from every state in the country. The random sample of Americans gave their answer over the phone or over the web.
While 48 percent of Americans found today's modern climate science more convincing, 36 percent answered that their climate views haven't changed. Just 16 percent said that the climate science ""has become less convincing.""
U.S. government atmospheric, marine, and earth scientists, however, have little doubt that the climate is experiencing profound change, and human activity is the dominant cause, as illustrated by recent reports from U.S. government scientists. 
""This period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization,"" the congressionally mandated Fourth National Climate Assessment, states. 
SEE ALSO: Antarcticas once sleepy ice sheets have awoken. That's bad.
""This assessment concludes, based on extensive evidence, that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,"" the report adds. 
Of the nearly half of Americans who said climate science has become more convincing, three-fourths of them attribute their changing views to the nation's recent bouts of extreme weather. In 2017 and 2018 alone, the U.S. experienced record-breaking heat, record-breaking flooding, record-breaking wildfires, and the relentless continuation of widespread drought over a huge swath of the Southwest.
Political leaders, however, had a comparatively smaller influence over changing how Americans felt about modern climate science. Eighteen percent of those surveyed responded that the views of political leaders were an ""influential factor"" in their changing views.
President Trump, who has by far the most influential reach on Twitter, consistently denies or jokes about global warming. Additionally, powerful Republican politicians continue to publicly sow doubt about climate science. Yet according to this recent poll, their efforts may be significantly overshadowed by the damaging realities of extreme weather. 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found that in 2017 the U.S. ""experienced a historic year of weather and climate disasters,"" with 16 separate billion-dollar disasters.
In total, 71 percent of Americans today reported that climate change is happening, which is similar to a 2017 poll from the same research organizations. As is well understood, most of the doubt about human-caused climate change comes from Republican voters. Of Americans who said climate change is happening, just five percent of Democrats said it can be explained by natural changes in the environment rather than human activity, as compared to nearly 30 percent of Republicans. 
This is consistent with 40 years of sustained Republican suspicion about the sciences, environmental historian James Turner previously explained to Mashable. 
But for the majority of Americans that do acknowledge the climate is changing, more are becoming convinced by mainstream, globally-agreed-upon science. After all, it's difficult to ignore extreme, pummeling weather.","Americans find modern climate science increasingly convincing, and a damaging mix of exceptional drought, storms, and record-breaking heat is the reason why.

Mark Kaufman,"Just as scientists confidently predicted last century, climate change is pushing weather to extremes all over the planet. A new report, published Monday by the American Meteorological Society, again proves the point. The 100-page report assessed 17 extreme weather events from 2017 including floods, droughts, and heat waves and determined global warming either significantly boosted the odds of these events, or simply made such extreme, often deadly events possible in the first place. ""We are in a world that is warmer than in the 20th Century, and we keep moving farther from that baseline,"" Martin Hoerling, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientist who worked on the report, said at the 2018 American Geophysical Union conference on Monday. ""There are very few places escaping from the warming that is occurring on our planet today,"" Hoerling added. Global temperatures compared to the average, with blues showing cooler temperatures. Image: nasa Global temperatures compared to the average, with yellows and reds showing warmer temperatures. Image: nasa For each extreme event, the report outlines just how much climate change increased their likelihood, which is a growing field of science known as attribution research. And when it comes to heat waves, rain, and drought, scientists have a good handle on how climate change exacerbates these events, often by modeling the chances of extreme weather events in the absence of today's globally disrupted climate. ""These attribution studies are telling us that a warming Earth is continuing to send us new and more extreme weather events every year, Jeff Rosenfeld, editor in chief of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, said in a statement. Extreme deluges Of note, Earth's hydrological, or water systems, have been propelled to the extreme. One reason is simple: Warming temperatures mean more water vapor is loaded into the atmosphere. Specifically for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the air can hold 7 percent more water. That can mean historic, prolonged deluges. Overflowing water surging out of California's damaged Oroville Dam spillway in 2017. Image: Dale Kolke/ California Department of Water Resources In the U.S., scientists pointed out deluges during the 2017 California winter that threatened to collapse the state's largest reservoir (the Oroville Dam), and the most extreme rain event in the nation's history, Hurricane Harvey. ""No single storm (Oroville) or instantaneous precipitation rate (Harvey) was to blame; rather, the damages were caused by precipitation that did not seem to stop,"" the authors wrote. The report also highlights severe 2017 flooding in Bangladesh, Peru and China. In Bangladesh, for example, extreme rain fell for six straight days before the expected monsoon, or summer rainfall season, even began. Human-caused warming, the authors found, was 100 percent responsible for the unusual rainfall event. Heat, heat, heat Heat waves, the number one natural killer of humans, made a strong appearance in 2017 ( and then again in 2018 ). Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1800s, climate change has boosted the average global temperature by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 degree Celsius. This background warming makes typical heat waves all the more extreme, resulting in record heat. ""Im virtually certain that nearly all heat waves have been made more severe by climate change,"" Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said this summer amid a flurry of global heat waves. SEE ALSO: Smokey Bear's world is on fire. But the old mascot won't die. In 2017, southern Europe experienced an ""exceptional heat wave"" which was nicknamed ""Lucifer."" Temperatures in the Balkans and Italy sustained in the triple-digits for days, records fell, and nighttime temperatures elsewhere exceeded over 85 degrees. Such a scorcher is three times more likely than it was in more temperate 1950s, the authors conclude. And while Europe burned, China did the same. The northeastern portion of the country saw its hottest temperatures on record, as a sustained mass of warm air hovered over the vast region. The authors concluded that climate change, all the more enhanced by decreasing Arctic sea ice (which ultimately helped produce this block of warm air), were the environmental culprits. While once rare, severe heat events in this part of China are now believed to have a one in five chance of happening during any given year. Paralyzing Drought A particularly harsh drought hit the Northern Great Plains of the U.S. in 2017 even threatening an essential ingredient in beer. This event, which proved to be a billion dollar disaster, hit Americans with a double whammy. Hot temperatures dried out the soil, easily outpacing dismal, record-low rains. After modeling different climate scenarios, researchers determined that this event was 1.5 times more likely under our current climate scenario, wherein the atmosphere is saturated with its highest levels of carbon dioxide in some 15 million years.","Just as scientists confidently predicted last century, climate change is pushing weather to extremes all over the planet.

"AP, AP","Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh watches the first half of an NFL football game against the Cleveland Browns, Sunday, Oct. 7, 2018, in Cleveland. (AP Photo/David Richard) (Photo: The Associated Press) OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) Baltimore safety Eric Weddle proudly proclaimed this wasn't the same Ravens team following a spirited victory over the Broncos in Week 3. He might have spoken too soon. The Ravens (3-2) have dropped out of first place in the AFC North following their 12-9 overtime loss to the revamped Cleveland Browns on Sunday. The performance was reminiscent of Baltimore's struggles in 2017 when it failed to make the postseason for the third consecutive year. The Ravens couldn't muster a touchdown and committed two turnovers, including one in the red zone, against a Cleveland defense that is ranked in the bottom third of league. Baltimore gave up 342 yards passing and a touchdown to rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield. The secondary also allowed a long play downfield in overtime that set up the game-winning, 37-yard field goal by Greg Joseph with two seconds remaining. Coach John Harbaugh defended his team's ratio between passing attempts (57) and the number of times the Ravens ran the ball (25) at his Monday news conference. ""That's not a topic for us,"" he said. ""You do whatever you can do to move the ball and score points. We've been doing a pretty good job of that until this last game. We just need to put more points on the board. Nine points. it's tough to win games that way. That's the bottom line. This run-pass balance thing, I don't understand why it's even a topic."" Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco was 29 of 56 for 298 yards and an interception on the Browns 2-yard line with his team leading 3-0. He was also sacked twice. Baltimore had broken an NFL record earlier this season with 12 touchdowns on its first 12 trips inside the red zone. However, the Ravens have since cooled down and were held scoreless in three red-zone opportunities against Cleveland. ""They took some of the big plays away from us and made us go the long, hard way,"" Flacco said about the Browns. ""We turned the ball over a couple times, and we had them getting a little tired. We just weren't able to keep and sustain it for anything significant. We had our chances. In these kind of games when you have little chances, you have to be able to take advantage of them. The couple that we had, we probably just didn't execute well."" Entering the year, Flacco was provided with more talent at wide receiver with the free-agent signings of Michael Crabtree, John Brown and Willie Snead. That trio has made plays throughout the season. Crabtree led the team with six catches for 66 yards against Cleveland. Brown had four catches for 58 yards and Snead caught five passes for 55 yards. However, Crabtree had a couple of critical drops that would have extended drives. He also could not hang onto a potential game-winning touchdown in the final minute of regulation. After the game, Crabtree took responsibility for the loss. ""I should have made that catch,"" Crabtree said. ""The game would have been over. I put that on me. If I have to catch 2,000 balls a week in practice, I'm going to have to do that."" The Ravens have to quickly regroup and prepare for the Tennessee Titans, which will close out a string of three consecutive road games. Baltimore will face its former defensive coordinator Dean Pees, who retired after the 2017 season before accepting the same role in Tennessee. ""We're quick to get over wins, and we have to be quick to get over losses,"" linebacker Terrell Suggs said. ""We're going to get back to the drawing board and come Wednesday, this one's going to be behind us. We're going to be ready for Tennessee."" ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

This puts the blaze's burned area as larger than New York City, and nearly the equivalent of the sprawling city of Los Angeles. The fire has destroyed 1,063 structures and damaged 280 more. During the past week, firefighters have made significant gains, with the state reporting 78 percent containment as of early Sunday morning. The record size was eclipsed on Dec. 22, with additional growth possible before full containment is made sometime in early 2018.

The state is seeing a trend toward more damaging wildfire seasons, with 14 of the 20 largest blazes on record occurring since they year 2000. This is due to a combination of factors, from climate change to urban sprawl. Temperature departures from average during summer 2017 across the state of California. Image: noaa/ncei. The Thomas Fire, along with other blazes that erupted across the state during the late summer and fall, resulted from a combination of climate extremes that are becoming more common in the state as a result of global climate change. Repeated, record heat waves sent temperatures soaring into the triple-digits as late as October, drying out vegetation that is now serving as fuel for the fires. Meanwhile, a large bulge, or ridge, in the jet stream has been steering Pacific storms away from California week after week, pushing the fire season deeper into the year.

With blazes burning in both Northern and Southern California, firefighters on the front lines are being pushed to the brink, many working 24-hour shifts to bring the infernos under control, said Batallion Chief Lucas Spellman of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. ""We're all very exhausted. But at this point, we have people depending on us and we have a job to do and we're not going to stop until these fires are put out,"" Spellman said in an interview with ABC News' Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos.

Firefighters working around the clock have gotten the blaze 25 percent contained.

Michael Mcgough,"An atmospheric river is sending rain Sacramento’s way this week, dropping as much as 4 feet of snow in the Sierra and giving a little bit of relief to Californians concerned about another drought. A wet March so far has aided the Sacramento Valley in inching closer to the average totals for the water year. The atmospheric river will no doubt help, but you’re probably wondering: What is an atmospheric river, anyway? The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines them as “relatively long, narrow regions in the atmosphere – like rivers in the sky – that transport most of the water vapor outside of the tropics.” For California, this means that streams of moisture are being pulled by wind from the tropics to the West Coast. Here are five other things to note about atmospheric rivers. Good news, bad news... The good news: Atmospheric rivers help provide much-needed rainfall, can give major boosts to snowpack in areas like the Sierra, and National Weather Service forecasts can accurately predict and map them in advance. The bad news: They also bring heavy rains, sometimes posing significant flood risks to Western states. Always be on the lookout for flood and flash food warnings. In some Southern California counties, mudslides are a risk. Like any moderate to severe storm, atmospheric rivers can lead travel problems and delays, as well as to power outages. Most are weak systems Despite sometimes being nicknamed “ horizontal hurricanes, ” the NOAA notes that many rivers don’t cause significant damage. Winds from the approaching system in inland Northern California are expected to see winds top out at 20 mph, but the Bay Area could see gusts reach 35 mph by midweek. How big are they? Atmospheric rivers span anywhere from 250 to 370 miles, according to the NOAA. How about some examples? Pineapple express is one of the better-known types of atmospheric river. It takes moisture streams from Hawaii to California and nearby states, and is one of the stronger AR systems. That's the type heading for the Bay Area, as well as parts of Southern California, this week. Other quick facts As explained by NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory : Atmospheric rivers are an important part of Earth’s water system, and must exist somewhere on earth at any given time. A handful of them account for as much as half of some West Coast states’ annual rainfall totals; therefore, they are critical to California’s water supply.","Sacramento Bee What is an 'atmospheric river,' anyway?

Andrew Freedman,"The weather in the Plains states has been anything but normal lately. Oklahoma — a state synonymous with tornadoes — didn't have a single twisters through April 30, a new record. Instead, states from Texas north to Nebraska have been dealing with dust storms and sprawling, fast-moving grass fires as unusually dry weather has taken its toll on the region. That tornado and precipitation drought changes on Tuesday, as a complex series of storm systems unleashes several rounds of severe thunderstorms across the region. SEE ALSO: Epic deluge in Hawaii may have broken all-time U.S. rainfall record, with 4 feet in 24 hours The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) — the arm of the National Weather Service responsible for issuing severe thunderstorm outlooks — issued a ""moderate risk"" outlook for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday.

Plot of annual tornado count, adjusted to remove overcounting from multiple sightings of the same tornado. 2018 is in black. Image: noaa spc. ""Tornadoes, a couple of which could be strong, very large hail, and damaging winds will be possible,"" the SPC stated on its website. Severe thunderstorms are also expected to flare up in Nebraska and Iowa on Tuesday afternoon and evening. Other areas, outside of Kansas, are also at risk for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday, even if forecaster confidence is lower. These places include Texas and Oklahoma, northward into Iowa. One limiting factor for storms, and a forecasting wild card, is the recent dryness that has contributed to the dire fire weather conditions in the past several weeks. Fires singed more than 350,000 acres in Oklahoma, killing more than 1,000 cattle. Fires are still burning in Oklahoma and Kansas today, at the same time the atmosphere is threatening to unleash a totally different type of hazard. While moisture from the Gulf of Mexico has flowed northward into the heart of what is commonly referred to as ""Tornado Alley,"" the dryness of soils in these states could act to inhibit the formation of severe storms. The threat of severe weather will ramp up on Wednesday and linger into Thursday as a series of storms dives into the Southwest, and moves across the Plains and Midwest. By Friday, it's quite possible that Oklahoma will have recorded its first tornado of the season. While tornado season usually peaks during the next few weeks, the same weather pattern responsible for the extraordinarily chilly April across much of the U.S. helped put a lid on severe storm activity up until now.

BeauHD,"The scientists examined precipitation trends and other data to determine the most likely causes of these huge losses and gains of water around the world. Their findings in a new study reveal that of the 34 ""hotspots"" of water change in places from California to China, the trends in about two-thirds of those areas may be linked to climate change or human activities, such as excessive groundwater pumping in farming regions. In eight of the 34 regions, the researchers said the trends reflect ""possible"" or ""probable"" impacts of climate change, including losses of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, precipitation increases in the high latitudes of Eurasia and North America, the retreat of Alaska's glaciers and melting ice fields in Patagonia.

James Vincent,"Ever since the beginning of the AI boom in the early 2010s, there’s been a corresponding drought in talented AI developers and researchers. The way to fix this is to educate more of them, and today, MIT announced a $1 billion initiative to do exactly that: it will establish a new college of computing to train the next generation of machine learning mavens. Importantly, the college isn’t just about training AI skills. Instead, it will focus on what MIT president L. Rafael Reif calls “the bilinguals of the future.” By that, he means students in fields like biology, chemistry, physics, politics, history, and linguistics who also know how to apply machine learning to these disciplines. (Presumably, Reif feels safe borrowing the term “bilingual” because, in the future, AI will be doing all the translation anyway.) interdisciplinary learning should mean better, saner artificial intelligence Two-thirds of the planned $1 billion commitment has been raised so far, with $350 million coming from Stephen A. Schwarzman, CEO of the private equity firm Blackstone. The new college will be named after Schwarzman, and it will include 50 new faculty positions, half of which will focus solely on computer science, while the rest are jointly appointed by the college and other MIT departments. The college is scheduled to open in September 2019, and its new building is planned to be completed in 2022. MIT is also angling the college as an ethically minded enterprise; one of its stated aims is to research “ethical considerations relevant to computing and AI.” It’s a frequent criticism of contemporary AI efforts that researchers sometimes ignore the history and lessons of the fields they are trying to “disrupt.” More collaboration should help. “As computing reshapes our world, MIT intends to help make sure it does so for the good of all,” said Reif in a press statement. “The MIT Schwarzman College of Computing will constitute both a global center for computing research and education, and an intellectual foundry for powerful new AI tools. Just as important, the College will equip students and researchers in any discipline to use computing and AI to advance their disciplines and vice-versa, as well as to think critically about the human impact of their work.”","The AI world agrees: we need more AI talent, especially with knowledge of other disciplines like physics, chemistry, history, and linguistics.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"But Dr. Tebaldi, a statistician who lives in Colorado, where she works at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, acknowledged that the study might provide little comfort to Northeasterners who experienced the bone-chilling cold during the last week of December and the first week of January. While Arctic air is milder because of climate change, the question of whether global warming is actually leading to more cold spells has been much debated. We know. Global warming is daunting. So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. Some recent studies have suggested that the loss of Arctic sea ice because of warming could be a factor, by influencing air circulation patterns, weakening the jet stream and allowing more polar air to shift southward, at least in some regions. But Dr. Tebaldi said her group’s study found no connection to sea-ice loss. World Weather Attribution is one of a number of scientific teams that in recent years has begun to analyze weather events for signs of the influence of climate change. The group, with members from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, Princeton University and other institutions as well as Climate Central, has found that global warming increased the likelihood of Hurricane Harvey’s torrential rains, a heat wave in Australia and other events. But some analyses have found little or no effect of climate change, including one of a Somali drought in 2016-17. The idea behind such rapid studies is to get scientific analysis to the public as soon as possible after an event. In this case, Dr. Tebaldi said, the analysis was even more rapid than usual — published just three days after the cold spell ended — because the researchers used methodologies that had already been developed, and because the study relied only on observations, not on computer models that can take time to run.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The statue of Indian independence leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is 182m high On 31 October India will unveil the world's tallest statue, which has cost hundreds of millions of dollars. BBC Gujarati's Roxy Gagdekar spoke to local farmers who say they are aghast that the government has spent so much money on it while they struggle to make ends meet. For years Vijendra Tadvi, a 39-year-old farmer in the western state of Gujarat, has been struggling to find water to irrigate his three acres (1.2 hectares) of farmland. He grows chilli, corn and groundnuts. Like millions of farmers across India, he relies on monsoon rains to water his crops. or he pumps out groundwater, which supports 80% of the rural water supply and farm irrigation. But long dry summers followed by erratic rains have led to frequent drought and shrunk the incomes of farmers like Mr Tadvi. So in 2015, Mr Tadvi found a job as a driver on a construction site to supplement his income. The Gujarat state government was building a 182m (600ft) high statue, billed as the tallest in the world. The bronze-clad tribute to Indian independence leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel cost 29.9bn rupees (£330m; $430m). And Gujarat's government is reported to have paid more than half of that amount. The remainder came from the federal government or public donations. ""Instead of spending money on a giant statue, the government should have used it for farmers in the district,"" Mr Tadvi said, adding that farmers in the area still lack basic irrigation facilities. The statue is complete and Mr Tadvi has found more work as a driver on construction sites. But he is still unimpressed by the government's largesse. Image caption Vijendra Tadvi says the government should spend money on farmers, not statues The ""statue of unity"", as it is known, is the centrepiece of a sprawling memorial to Patel. A formidable nationalist leader, he was born in Gujarat and went on to become independent India's first interior minister and deputy prime minister under Jawaharlal Nehru. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is also from Gujarat, commissioned the statue when he was the state's chief minister in 2010. In recent years, Mr Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has embraced Patel in an attempt to claim his legacy - and they have accused the opposition Congress party of sidelining him to benefit Nehru's descendants, three of whom have served as prime ministers. Congress ruled India for 49 of its 71 years as an independent nation. The plan for Patel's memorial includes a three-star hotel, a museum and a research centre that will focus on subjects ""close to his heart"" - such as ""good governance"" and ""agriculture development"". All of this is about 10km (6.2 miles) from Mr Tadvi's village, Nana Pipaliya, in the largely poor, rural and tribal Narmada district. Many of its households continue to live in hunger, primary school enrolment has been falling and malnourishment persists, according to a report published in 2016 by the state government. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Farmers are increasingly protesting over loan waivers and crop prices But the government believes the memorial will boost the district's economy, as they expect about 2.5 million annual visitors. ""It will lead to employment opportunities for locals and will also increase tourism in the area,"" said Sandeep Kumar, a senior official involved with the project. Locals are sceptical. ""We want to ask the government: why can't they fund a project to support farmers and improve their standard of life?"" said Lakhan, a tribal activist who only goes by his first name. ""We were promised water for irrigation but the situation remains the same."" Nana Pipaliya is in what is known as a ""command area"" of a nearby dam - lands that are supposed to receive water from a designated irrigation project. But, Mr Tadvi said, he and other farmers were still deprived of water. ""I grow only one crop per year, while people with irrigation facilities grow up to three crops annually,"" said Bhola Tadvi, a farmer who relies solely on rainwater for irrigation. According to the 2011 census, some 85% of the district's working population is engaged in agriculture, a sector which is dominated by small farmers who own two to four acres of land. District officials told BBC Gujarati that the government was committed to ensuring that water was made available to them. Lakhan said thousands of farmers were struggling to access water for irrigation. Image caption Farmers regularly suffer heavy losses caused by drought Half of India's population works on farms, but farming contributes only 15% to the country's GDP. In fact, agriculture growth in India has dwindled to 1.2%. Farms employ a lot of people but produce too little, and tens of thousands of farmers struggle to repay crop loans taken from banks and money lenders. Earlier this year, farmers in the neighbouring state of Maharashtra staged a massive protest demanding a waiver on the repayment of loans and better prices for their crops. In 2017, farmers from drought-affected districts in the southern state of Tamil Nadu brandished human skulls and a held live mice between their teeth to draw attention to their plight. Here in the shadow of Patel's statue, farmers have resorted to stealing water. They say they can see the water passing by their farms through a canal that transports it from the dam, but it's illegal to divert the water so they are forced to steal it. One of the farmers said he had laid a pipe underground from the canal to his farm, adding that nearly all farmers in the area did this to survive. ""We don't have any option but to take the water illegally as there are no sources of water left for us.""","India is set to unveil the world's tallest statue, whose $430m price tag has angered local farmers.",2018-10-27T23:48:31Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Indian farmers fume at $430m cost of Gujurat statue,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-45978120,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/70D3/production/_104038882_gettyimages-1052438830.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,drought,1

BILL PENNINGTON,"Worse, a day earlier, Billy Payne, then the Augusta National chairman, had delivered a harsh rebuke, saying Woods did not live up to role model expectations and had disappointed all of us, and more important, our kids and our grandkids.
All in all, not a great day for the worlds top-ranked golfer, who had won 14 major golf championships and was still expected to vault past the record, Jack Nicklauss 18.
But the Augusta National scene on Tuesday found Woods humbled and changed in ways unimaginable from the 2010 Masters. Yes, he is still chasing a 15th major championship, but tellingly, he seems less frantic about that pursuit than ever. Asked if he would have expected such a lengthy major drought, Woods calmly answered, Yeah, I would say that I wouldnt have foreseen that, for sure.

Eric Niiler,"There was a time many years ago when cars guzzled gas like beer, teenagers raced them on Friday nights, and Detroit automakers boasted about their vehicles' ever-increasing horsepower and speed. Since then, cars have become safer, cleaner and more efficient, mostly as a result of tougher standards from Washington. A new Trump administration proposal might bring that half a century of vehicular progress screeching to a halt, some experts say, by shrugging its collective shoulders at the growing danger of climate change and the fuel-efficiency standards designed to combat it. The White House wants to freeze future auto emissions standards and ban California from making its own tougher rules for carbon emissions from vehicles. First, a look at the numbers. A little-noticed report issued by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) predicts that the Earths temperature will rise a whopping 7° Fahrenheit (4° Celsius) by 2100, assuming that little or nothing is done to reverse emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The current Paris climate accords call for nations to pledge to keep warming below 3.6° F (2° C) by centurys end. The Trump administrations climate change scenario would likely entail catastrophic melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, causing rising sea levels that would flood low-lying coastal areas from Maine to Texasnot to mention warmer oceans that could spawn ever-stronger hurricanes alongside pockets of inland drought, and a collapse of agriculture in many areas. The NHTSA report came up with these doomsday numbers to argue that automobile and truck tailpipe emissions after 2020 will have such a small global impact on overall greenhouse gases that it's not worth tightening the screws on Detroit automakers. What they are saying is we are going to hell anyhow, what difference does it make if we go a little faster, says David Pettit, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Thats their theory of how they are dealing with greenhouse gas emissions. Pettit and others say the NHTSA report and the Trump administrations proposal to roll back future tailpipe emissions standards would allow Detroit to build bigger, thirstier cars than would have been permitted under President Obama-era rules. Pettit notes that he has gone from driving a 7-miles-per-gallon Chrysler in the late 1960s to a Chevy Bolt today, largely as the result of stricter federal standards that require automakers to sell clean cars alongside their SUVs and trucks. In addition to throwing up its hands at climate change, the Trump administration also argues that continuing to increase fuel economy requirements will make the overall vehicle fleet less safe, because people will continue to drive older cars longer than they otherwise would. The argument is that the higher price tags on more fuel-efficient cars will deter consumers from buying new vehicles equipped with more advanced technology that also improves safety. But Giorgio Rizzoni, director of the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University, says the administration has it backwards. His study of the past 40 years concludes that safety and fuel efficiency have grown at the same time. If the Trump administration rules are passed, American carbuyers might end up seeing vehicles with less advanced technology on the dealer lot than overseas buyers, says Austin Brown, executive director of the UC Davis Policy Institute for Energy, Environment and the Economy. The cars would look the same on the outside, but they would burn more gasoline, cost more money and create more emissions, he says. That's because US cars with weaker fuel standards won't be sold on worldwide markets, he adds. The Trump administration held public meetings on the proposal this week in Fresno, California; Dearborn, Michigan; and Pittsburgh. The deadline for written comments is October 23.

According to The Local news website, nudists have been complaining to officials in provincial Smaland about livestock visiting their beaches, saying that their presence is ""unhygienic and could pose a health risk"". It says the roasting summer heat affecting much of continental Europe has led to drought throughout the country, and has meant that farmers have been struggling to feed their animals. This has meant that some farmers have decided to slaughter their cattle earlier than usual; but others have instead decided to bring their livestock to nearby nudist beaches, in order to cool them down, public broadcaster SVT reports. ""When it's this dry, you don't want cows to be brought to slaughter out of necessity. They need to be able to bathe, eat and drink,"" municipal official Peter Bengtsson says. Complaints from bathers have led to municipal Vaxjo's Culture and Leisure Department taking a vote on whether the cattle were ok to visit, and have ruled they ""have just as much right to be there as the human visitors"". Mr Bengtsson says that bathers should not be at risk of contracting infections such as E.Coli, but that farmers should refrain from taking cows in the water if there are people around who want to swim. He noted that birds also frequent Smaland's nudist beaches, but said that if bathers express concerns about allergies or safety as a result of ground damage, officials may talk to the animals' owners.

SOMINI SENGUPTA,"This year, heat has been a problem in both northern and southern hemispheres. In Alaska, warmer-than-usual temperatures forced the cancellation of sled dog races, while cities in New Zealand, where the weather is generally so temperate that most homes dont have heating or air-conditioners, broke heat records. On Tuesday, Wellington, the capital, soared past 87 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest since record-keeping began in 1927, and Hamilton topped 91 degrees, the highest since record-keeping began in 1940.
Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, a forecasting service, said that in preparing for how climate change affects the weather, we have to be prepared for a wider range of possibilities.
Some preparation is connected to resiliency. Mayors promise to make their cities more resilient to climate change after one disaster or another. Scientists experiment with crop seeds that are more resilient to the vagaries of extreme heat and drought.
Dr. Kolden, the fire specialist, noted that as a species, we pride ourselves on being resilient. But that human trait can also have a downside. Its why, often, even when officials tell us to evacuate from a fire zone or a flood plain, we dont. We think well make it, because weve made it before. Or that the forecasters are wrong.
In our DNA, weve got this extreme resilience baked in, Dr. Kolden said. That ends up being our downfall when it comes to the changing conditions.

ERIC SCHMITT and CHARLIE SAVAGE,"Many of the recent airstrikes have targeted large groups of suspected fighters, killing more than 10 people in a single fierce swoop. Africa Command has disclosed strikes and estimated death tolls in a series of terse news releases, earning scant attention from Congress or the news media.
Along with the European Union and the United Nations, the United States also has continued to invest in so-called soft power assistance to Somalia, providing humanitarian aid such as food to drought victims, and development programs on education and training.
Officials cited signs of recent incremental progress in efforts to help the Somali government build a functional national army. And in December, the United States re-established a permanent diplomatic presence in Somalia for the first time since 1991. The current United States ambassador to Somalia, Donald Yamamoto, lives in Mogadishu, although the mission consists of a windowless bunker at the well-guarded airport.

And in late February, the Shabab claimed a double bombing and the siege of a hotel in Mogadishu that killed at least 25 people.
General Olson said the military would continue to go after the Shabab as long as that is its mission.
We go after the network when the network presents itself, whether a single node or a concentration, he said. Weve developed intelligence and are sussing out the relationship between the leadership and those being led; between those being led and those being trained or recruited or massed for an attack.
We understand the network better than we have in years past, General Olson said.","Even as the Trump administration pulls back from counterinsurgency operations elsewhere, airstrikes targeting Islamist militants in Somalia have soared.",2019-03-10T20:41:27Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",U.S. Airstrikes Kill Hundreds in Somalia as Shadowy Conflict Ramps Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/us/politics/us-somalia-airstrikes-shabab.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/10/us/politics/10dc-somalia2/10dc-somalia2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,drought,1
"Jim Halley, USA TODAY High School Sports","Deer are a common sight in Manitou Springs, Colo., and on Tuesday, three deer disrupted a baseball game between host Manitou Springs and rival St. Mary’s (Colorado Springs), according to the Colorado High School Activities Association. In the top of the sixth inning, the deer entered the field and it took 10 minutes for officials, even with an assist from Manitou Springs shortstop Joey Allen, to shoo the deer off the field through a side gate. Manitou Springs is at the foot of Pike’s Peak and with a lesser than usual snowpack this year, drought conditions are in effect in the area and apparently the vision of all that green grass was too hard to pass up for the fauna. This is not the first time that deer have disrupted games at Manitou. Football games as well as boys and girls soccer games have often been delayed by the animals.

Mark Kaufman,"Solar geoengineering is widely viewed as risky business. 
The somewhat sci-fi concept to use blimps, planes, or other means to load Earth's atmosphere with particles or droplets that reflect sunlight and cool the planet has crept into the mainstream conversation as a means of reversing relentless climate change, should our efforts to slash carbon emissions fail or sputter. But geoengineering schemes come with a slew of hazards. A number ofstudies have cited the ill consequences of messing with Earth's sun intake, including big falls in crop production, the likelihood of unforeseen adverse side effects, and critically, a weakened water cycle that could trigger drops in precipitation and widespread drought.
Yet new research, published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, acknowledges these problems but finds a potential fix: only deploying enough reflective specks in the atmosphere to reduce about half of Earth's warming, rather than relying on geoengineering to completely return Earth to the cooler, milder climate of the 19th century. In other words, giving Earth a geoengineering dose that would reverse a significant portion of the warming, but not enough to stoke the problematic side effects.  
""We wanted to clear up if some of the issues that weve seen were the result of doing too much geoengineering,"" said Peter Irvine, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and lead author of the study.
In the early 2000s, the notion of geoengineering sounded like a ""really outlandish idea,"" Irvine admitted. But this new research, building on other studies, illustrates that such a planetary-wide undertaking if applied cautiously, incrementally, and with careful dosing might not be so far-fetched, after all. 
""It looks like, surprisingly, it works quite well,"" said Irvine.

That's not to say Irvine and his research team are promoting the idea of deploying geoengineering on the planet anytime soon. They aren't. Rather, this research is a piece of the puzzle that may ultimately reveal if geoengineering could work without unleashing widescale harm to the planet, particularly plunges in rainfall (in part due to reduced sunlight resulting in less energy driving rainfall and precipitation).
""I dont think it makes any sense to do it now,"" David Keith, a solar engineering researcher at Harvard University and study coauthor, said. ""And if it doesnt make sense, we shouldnt do it,"" he added, noting that any geoengineering deployment would likely still be some two decades away.  
SEE ALSO: Will cockroaches really inherit the Earth?
""This is the type of work that researchers should be doing to understand the potential climate impacts of solar geoengineering,"" said Jon Proctor, who researches the impacts of geoengineering on agriculture and had no role in the study.  ""However, we are still far from understanding the full costs and benefits of solar geoengineering to economic and ecological wellbeing,"" added Proctor, who is a Ph.D. candidate in agriculture and resource economics at UC Berkeley.
To see how providing a ""half dose"" of geoengineering would affect the planet, the study's researchers visited the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) super-advanced climate model at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory to simulate Earth's future climate. Specifically, they doubled the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere (from 1990 levels) and then ""turned down the sun,"" so to speak, to mimic the effects of solar geoengineering under such conditions. 
The results cut Earth's warming by about half. And critically, the cooling effect did not wreak havoc on Earth's water system by decreasing rainfall in vast regions around the world. In such a carbon-saturated atmosphere, the simulated geoengineering also tempered extreme, crippling deluges (which are becoming more common as the climate warms) and reduced the intensity of hurricanes. ""By choosing to half warming, were going to get close to restoring the water cycle,"" said Irvine. 
A smaller portion of the world about half a percent saw an uptick in the extreme weather stoked by climate change. 
Such a geoengineering endeavor certainly wouldn't solve all the planet's environmental woes in a warmer world. ""No it's not perfect,"" said Irvine. But halving warming might cut into the weather extremes wrought by the highest atmospheric carbon dioxide levels Earth has experienced in millions of years. Already, Earth's CO2 levels are likely the highest they've been in some 15 million years. 
""I hope that the paper can be a springboard to rethink some common assumptions.""
The possibility that geoengineering could alter the globe's water cycle and produce widescale drought is a big red flag, said Keith, but he hopes this study illustrates that such damaging changes might be avoided, though there's still ample research to be done. ""I hope that the paper can be a springboard to rethink some common assumptions [about geoengineering],"" he said. 
What's more, Keith emphasized that this study isn't just coauthored by known geoengineering researchers like Keith and Irvine, but diverse, well-respected atmospheric scientists like MIT's Kerry Emanuel, an accomplished climate researcher. ""Having these different names on the paper should make this be considered more seriously,"" said Keith. 
Coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel and creates ~35% of global CO2 emissions.
The UK reduced coal usage by 78% since 2013 (mostly by adding renewables) and as a result reduced total CO2 emissions by 21%.
Eliminating coal is one of the best options for CO2 reductions.
 Robert Rohde (@RARohde) March 5, 2019
If the time ever comes for geoengineering in a political climate where climate deniers in powerful government positions still make unfounded claims that plants are in dire need of more carbon Keith underscores that it can't be an emergency, last ditch effort, like deploying a parachute. Whether achieved by big weather balloons, blimps, or other methods, solar geoengineering would have to be done carefully, methodically, and incrementally. 
In short, it's a fantasy that a massive fleet of blimps will one day suddenly take to air and release bounties of reflective particles in the skies when crops fail and Antarctica unleashes an unstoppable flow of ice into the seas. 
""Solar engineering might not be a good choice in an emergency,"" said Keith. ""If it makes any sense at all, it makes sense to gradually ramp it up.""","Solar geoengineering is widely viewed as risky business.

Jonathan Shieber,"Weather and climate-related disasters cost the U.S. economy $80 billion last year — and have hit the nation’s bottom line to the tune of roughly $100 billion per year over the last five years, according to a new survey from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
That tally comes as NASA reported that 2018 was also the fourth warmest year ever recorded — continuing a trend of record-breaking global temperatures.
It looks like the anthropogenic causes of climate change are becoming harder to ignore.
Indeed, the NOAA’s Climate.gov report was very blunt about the causes of the increasing frequency with which natural disasters are occurring across the country:
The past three years (2016-2018) have been historic, with the annual average number of billion-dollar disasters being more than double the long-term average. The number and cost of disasters are increasing over time due to a combination of increased exposure, vulnerability, and the fact the climate change is increasing the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters.
In total, the U.S. was hit by 14 separate disaster events whose costs were more than $1 billion: the litany of climatological horrors included two tropical cyclones, eight severe storms, two winter storms, prolonged drought and wildfires (that probably burned all the partridges out of their pear trees).
As the NOAA report notes, this tally is the fourth highest number of total events ever recorded — behind 2017 and 2011 (tied at 16 natural disasters) and 2015, which saw 15 natural disasters worth more than $1 billion slam the U.S.
Last year was also one of the costliest for the American economy in terms of the impact from natural disasters. The $80 billion price tag is only topped by 2017, when storms, fires, floods and drought cost the economy $312.7 billion (a record); 2005, when the number hit $220.8 billion and 2012 when $128.6 billion was lost due to climate-related disasters.
Of the events that are the most damaging and costliest to the U.S. economy, hurricanes rank the highest. And from 2016-2018 the U.S. was impacted by six separate hurricanes that cost the economy more than $1 billion. In all, those disasters wrought some $329.9 billion in economic damage and killed 3,138 people.
While there’s a tragic, historic precedence for the damage caused by hurricanes, the Western wildfire seasons of the past two years are unprecedented in size and scope in modern history. With costs running over $40 billion, the wildfire costs in the U.S. for the last two years are equal to the cost from fires for the previous 37 years combined.
Meanwhile, NASA scientists have said that the past five years have been, collectively, the warmest years in the modern record.
2018 is yet again an extremely warm year on top of a long-term global warming trend, said GISS Director Gavin Schmidt, in a statement.
Since the 1880s, the average global surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit — and this warming is caused in large part by increased emissions into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, Schmidt said.
The impacts of long-term global warming are already being felt  in coastal flooding, heat waves, intense precipitation and ecosystem change, said Schmidt, in a statement.
It’s important to note that overall global warming contributes to drastic shifts in climate patterns and climate change. It doesn’t mean that there won’t be conditions of extreme cold as (ahem) some people seem to think.
In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People cant last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2019
In fact, global warming hasn’t gone anywhere… yet.
There is a plan being proposed by Democrats in the House of Representatives that aims to push the U.S. to rapidly decarbonize its economy in a bid to offset some of the worst effects that are expected should global temperatures continue to rise (and if anyone wants to send that to me, I’d be obliged).
Given that most reports put a 12-year time frame around reversing the worst impacts of climate change, and U.S. reports put the potential economic damage of unchecked warming at somewhere close to $500 billion, getting a move on toward possible solutions seems like a good idea. Let’s hope Congress can follow through.","Weather and climate-related disasters cost the U.S. economy $80 billion last year — and have hit the nation’s bottom line to the tune of roughly $100 billion per year over the last five years, according to a new survey from the National Oceanic and Atmospheri…",2019-02-06T21:50:12Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","Weather and climate-related disasters cost the US $80 billion in 2018, but go ahead and say climate change isn’t real",http://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/weather-and-climate-related-disasters-cost-the-us-80-billion-in-2018-but-go-ahead-and-say-climate-change-isnt-real/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-28-at-8.53.34-AM.png?w=764,techcrunch,TechCrunch,drought,1
MATT STEVENS,"Good morning.
(Want to get California Today by email? Heres the sign-up.)
Since its just a few days after Christmas, I thought now would be a good time to check back in on the N.B.A. Christmas, after all, is perhaps the most celebrated day of the regular season, and a signal that we are almost halfway through it.
So I asked one of our N.B.A. experts, Marc Stein, to give us a little update on how Californias four teams are doing. He told me something surprising and raised an intriguing question: This is the 34th season in which California has housed four N.B.A. franchises and the state is 0 for 33 when it comes to sending all four teams to the playoffs in the same season. Could this be the year that the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers and Sacramento Kings finally conspire to end that drought?
As Marc pointed out, all four teams have winning records. Heres his quick take on where each of them stands:
Warriors (23-13) 
The champs are 15-5 when their four best players (Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson) have been healthy enough to play together so no one is deeply worried about them just yet. But Green and Thompson are mired in shooting slumps, depth and advancing age are two more concerns and the teams marquee off-season acquisition, DeMarcus Cousins, has yet to appear in a single game. Its a good thing for the Warriors that the rest of the West, while ridiculously deep with competent teams, doesnt appear to house a consensus threat to the overwhelming preseason favorites.","Friday: Considering whether all of the state’s teams can make the playoffs, President Trump weighs in on the killing of a police officer, and the year in pictures.",2018-12-28T13:59:58Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Could This Be the Year California Sends Four Teams to the N.B.A. Finals?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/us/california-today-nba-christmas.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/26/sports/26lebron2/26lebron2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,drought,1

"USA TODAY, Mike Hembree, USA TODAY","NASCAR drivers dish on the many autographs they have signed. USA TODAY Sports Clint Bowyer carries a checkered flag Monday that he had not earned in 190 races. (Photo: Michael Shroyer, USA TODAY) MARTINSVILLE, Va. – Five takeaways from Monday’s STP 500 at Martinsville Speedway as Monster Energy NASCAR Cup teams enter the first non-race weekend of the year: One of the people most responsible for Clint Bowyer’s drought-ending victory in Monday’s race wasn’t at the track – and by his design. Tony Gibson is production manager at Stewart-Haas Racing. He’s involved with every car that rolls out of the team’s shop as the leader of what he calls the grunts – the mechanics who put cars together on virtually every working day. Gibson became one of them this season after three decades on the NASCAR road, many as a crew chief. He chose to leave the traveling circus to return to the “real world” and enjoy some off weekends. His impact, however, remains. “He's a racer,” SHR competition director Greg Zipadelli said of Gibson. “He's back there digging, just simply helping. We're focused on the quality of our race cars. Every single one of them needed to be better than what they were last year, and by adding some people, splitting some roles up, it allowed people to pay attention to little details. “What he has done is he's allowed other people to do a better job at what they needed to do because he took a little bit of load off of a lot of people.” Cautions to the wind: The STP 500 was odd not only because it was held on Monday – weekend snow messed up the schedule – but also because it was one of the calmest races in recent Martinsville Speedway history. The field raced through the first 384 laps of the 500-lap race without producing an accident that led to a caution flag. The only caution of the event that was prompted by an on-track incident occurred on lap 385 when contact between Austin Dillon and Jamie McMurray sent McMurray into the outside wall. There were three earlier cautions, but all were scheduled – the first a competition caution at lap 52 and the second and third for the ends of stages. Martinsville, which has been on the Cup circuit since the first season in 1949, has an average of 13 cautions per race. Battling droughts: Clint Bowyer’s victory ended a six-year, 190-race winless streak for the Kansas driver. It was a long, painful journey, but it didn’t approach the Cup Series’ longest drought between wins. That dubious honor belongs to former series champion Bill Elliott, who endured a 226-race losing streak between victories at Darlington, S.C. in 1994 and Homestead, Fla. in 2001. Last Slide Next Slide Bowman leads Chevy: Monday’s race wasn’t a thriller for Chevrolet teams as Ford and Toyota claimed the first six finishing spots. Hendrick Motorsports newcomer Alex Bowman, the replacement driver for the retired Dale Earnhardt Jr., was the top Chevy driver in seventh place. Bowman said the race was eventful for him even though there were only four caution flags. “I had my hands full,” he said. “It wasn’t mellow for me. I’m a little worn out. That was a physical one for me, at least. I changed some stuff inside the race car that made me able to go faster but probably wore me out a little quicker. Hembree: Bowyer ends long skid, gives son checkered flag he promised Wife says no: Kansas fan Clint Bowyer nixed for Final Four, but title game possible Hembree: Snow at Martinsville rekindles memories of epic havoc 25 years ago “I’m glad that I didn’t fall out of the seat there because it was pretty physical, but it was fun.” Easter break: The first of only three off-weeks in the February-to-November Cup Series schedule arrives this week as no national-series races are scheduled because of the Easter holiday. Drivers are likely to be spread across the continent – and perhaps beyond – as they enjoy a few days away from racing. Martinsville winner Clint Bowyer is a fan of the University of Kansas basketball team and might be expected to be at the Final Four in San Antonio over the weekend to watch the Jayhawks. Bowyer mentioned that possibility in his post-race press conference Monday night, but his wife, Lorra, ended that thought process with one word: “No.” Last Slide Next Slide","Five takeaways from Clint Bowyer's drought-ending victory Monday at Martinsville Speedway, including his behind-the-scenes weapon.",2018-03-27T17:09:32Z,"{'id': 'usa-today', 'name': 'USA Today'}",Five takeaways: Clint Bowyer's behind-the-scenes weapon helped end long skid,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2018/03/27/takeaways-nascar-clint-bowyer-drought-ending-behind-scenes-weapon/462107002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/30dead04d4d0041ba1ae33f7a8707f0f330afa08/c=0-4-255-148&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/03/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636577514562678694-Bowyer-checkered-flag.jpg,usa-today,USA Today,drought,1
Camila Domonoske,"Drone footage captured by Anthony Murphy shows the outline of an ancient henge, visible in the pattern of crops grown in a field near Newgrange, Ireland. Anthony Murphy/Mythical Ireland A drone flight and a lingering dry spell have exposed a previously unknown monument in Ireland's Boyne Valley, forgotten for thousands of years and long covered by crops — which, struggling to cope with a lengthy drought, finally revealed the ancient footprint. Photographer and author Anthony Murphy discovered the site. He was flying a drone near Newgrange, a famous prehistoric stone monument in County Meath, on Tuesday, taking pictures of the known archaeological attractions. Then he saw something strange — a perfect circle, etched in the color of the crops, in an otherwise unremarkable field. Murphy runs the website Mythical Ireland (also the name of his latest book), which focuses on the megalithic monuments of the Boyne Valley. He knew the local sites well — every passage tomb, every banked enclosure, every archaeological dig. And he'd been flying drones here for months. He'd never seen this. He shouted at another photographer, who was flying his own drone nearby, ""What the f*** is that?"" ""I've been telling all the media here that I shouted 'What the hell is that,' but it was actually a stronger expletive,"" Murphy tells NPR. ""When we saw this, we knew straight away, this had never been seen or recorded before."" A closer look revealed two concentric circles, the inner one evenly segmented. They immediately sent pictures to archaeologists, who confirmed their suspicions. Murphy and his colleague, Ken Williams, had found the footprint of an ancient henge, or enclosure, that may be some 4,500 years old. In the background you can see ""Site P,"" a known henge in the Brú na Bóinne World Heritage Site. Anthony Murphy was photographing Site P when he noticed something strange in a field nearby — the previously unknown henge visible in the foreground, in the field. Anthony Murphy/Mythical Ireland The area around Newgrange is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with a number of ancient and prehistoric monuments, including other henges. The region has been pored over by archaeologists for decades. But this henge was thoroughly hidden, until the drought revealed it. Ireland is famously green, of course, with rainfall usually abundant. But this summer it's been gripped by an unusual heatwave and a lengthy dry spell. ( The New York Times notes that ""[c]limatologists say that it is hard to connect any single weather event to climate change, but that heat waves and extreme swings in precipitation are expected effects."") Crops are fading in the drought. And the unusual weather circumstances made the remarkable photos possible, Murphy explains. ""In the late Neolithic, people would have built this henge out of timber,"" he says. Imagine massive posts — possibly whole tree trunks — planted in pits and postholes. ""Over time, when the monument fell out of use, the wood all rots away and the holes kind of fill up with organic material,"" he said. ""But they leave a sort of a fingerprint, or a footprint."" Archaeologists can see it in soil samples. And, in a drought, you can see the impact on crops. ""Those filled-in holes retain a slight amount more moisture than the surrounding soil,"" Murphy says. ""The crop that is growing out of those features has a very small advantage in terms of additional water and it's very slightly healthier."" In normal weather, the difference is undetectable — that's why Murphy had flown drones overhead before without noticing it. And even in a drought, it's too subtle to see from the ground. But combine the dry spell with the aerial view, and suddenly the outline is obvious. The photos are intriguing, as well as surprising. There are numerous henges in the Boyne Valley, but they don't have the same pattern of regular gaps that this henge does. ""That's not just highly unusual,"" Murphy says. ""It's unique."" ""This is internationally significant and we now need to figure out what it means,"" archaeologist Steve Davis of University College Dublin told the BBC. ""It has some characteristics that we've never seen before. For example, the very odd double ditch sections."" The function of prehistoric henges is a topic of debate, although many scholars suspect they were ceremonial sites. Archaeologist Geraldine Stout told the Irish Times she believes many monuments around Newgrange were built for prehistoric pilgrims, as part of a ""sacred landscape."" More research would be needed to determine the precise age and construction of this newly discovered henge. The BBC reports that it is located on private land and there are currently no plans to excavate. Ireland's National Monument Service confirmed to the Irish Times that it will be doing ""further technical work to help determine the nature of the site."" ""[F]rom the drone images visible on social media, it is a very significant find which fits within the knowledge of large prehistoric ritual enclosures and associated ritual landscapes as at Brú na Bóinne,"" the name of the region's World Heritage Site, the service said. Murphy, the writer and photographer who found the site, is delighted — he calls it ""a little bit of a miracle"" that he uncovered the henge. It was a question of lucky timing, he says. ""The last time we had a drought, a spell where we had no rain for this long, was in 1976,"" he said. ""And of course in 1976, there was no such thing as drones, and there was much less emphasis on aerial photography or aerial archaeology... "" And then, he says, there was the sheer luck of having a grainfield right on top of the remains of the henge. ""If there was just ordinary grass in that field,"" he says, ""this thing would never have shown.""","As crops get thirsty in Ireland, some plants are faring better than others.

While a ""10-year challenge"" showing a decade's difference in the same person's photo trends online, people concerned about climate change are posting before and after photos of glaciers, coral reefs and drought-stricken landscapes to make a point about climate change.
The most recent 10-year challenge (they pop up fairly often) first appeared just after New Years, as they often do. It suggested people post photos of themselves as they are today and as they were a decade ago.
Facebook, Instagram and Twitter responded with gusto. Celebrities especially seemed to enjoy showing how they'd matured/cleaned up/buffed up/hired better stylists/upgraded their wardrobes.
While many of the postings quickly ran to the silly, a more somber variant has appeared, with people posting photos of scenes from across the globe showing how rapidly things are degrading in a warming world. They're often accompanied by the line, ""The only #10YearChallenge we should care about.""
The real #10yearchallenge? Climate change. According to @IPCC_CH#SR15, we have just over 10 years to #ActOnClimate before we cause irreparable damage to our planet.

The juxtaposed photos highlight the sometimes extreme changes that have come about in as little as a decade, including glaciers retreating, former marinas turned to dry land due to drought, mass bleaching of one thriving coral reefs and starving polar bears.
It's the physical manifestation of an on-going issue. Scientists report that 2018 was the warmest year on record for the world's oceans. The Antarctic Ice Sheet is melting six times faster than it was 40 years ago and reached a record low for January this year.
The cause is a rise in warmth-trapping greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.
Humans have increased the Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution began, according to NASA. The extra carbon dioxide has caused temperatures to rise to levels that cannot be explained by natural factors, scientists report.
During the 20th century, the Earth's average temperature increased about 2 degrees Fahrenheit, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows.  
In Florida, conservation tour leader Jim Abernathy saw his Instagram account blow up when he posted a montage of before and after photos.
Hed seen the regular 10 Year Challenge posts online and thought they were a waste of time. I dont care what people looked like 10 years ago, he said.
But then I thought, We should we looking at real problems, The number of responses he got shocked him. Though he admitted it could have been that he simply doesnt spend a lot of time online as hes usually on his boat leading scuba tours to visit sharks and other marine life.
Lots of people disputed the one of the starving polar bear. But I happen to know the photographer, Paul Nicklen. It was his shot and it was real, he said.

"AP, AP","AP GANGNEUNG, South Korea (AP) — That Russian gold medal drought at the Pyeongchang Olympics is closer to ending. Teen figure skaters Alina Zagitova or Evgenia Medvedeva will almost certainly take gold in one of the Winter Games marquee events after they went 1-2 in the women's short program Wednesday with the highest scores ever. Medvedeva had not lost a competition in two years until she was beaten by Zagitova at the European Championships in Moscow. That set the stage for an Olympic showdown, and with the Russian team having no gold medal so far, the spotlight was even more glaring for them. They responded with world records. Medvedeva had set the previous mark for a short program in the team event, when her team won silver. Zagitova handled the free skate. Russia had never won Olympic gold for women until Adelina Sotnikova took home the medal in Sochi. Another is looming heading to Friday's free skate to conclude Olympic figure skating. It should break the Russian gold medal drought unless one of their teammates beats them to the podium. Medvedeva wasn't at her best, yet her mark was a record 81.61. A group of Russian fans swayed together in the stands and chanted her name when that number was posted. ""I'm satisfied with my performance today. It was not my best, but it was OK,"" she said. ""All the battle is still ahead."" Three skaters later came her training comrade, 15-year-old Zagitova, who put down a more difficult program, including a triple lutz-triple loop combination that outdid Medvedeva's flip-toe loop combo. So, another world record, 82.92. And again the Russian fans rocked back and forth, this time chanting Zagitova's name. ""Well done to her,"" Medvedeva said. ""She did everything she could.""

"AP, AP","FILE - In this Oct. 11, 2017, file photo, Cleveland Indians' Francisco Lindor warms up before an American League Division Series playoff game against the New York Yankees in Cleveland. Determined to end their World Series title drought in 2017 after coming so close the previous season, the AL Central champions were bounced in the playoffs by the New York Yankees despite taking a 2-0 series lead. It was a bitter finish for a team that won 102 games and reeled off 22 straight victories. But while there was a sense of finality for some Cleveland fans, manager Terry Francona said these Indians aren’t done. (AP Photo/Phil Long, File) (Photo: The Associated Press) CLEVELAND (AP) — Once the pain from their postseason elimination eased, the Cleveland Indians didn't panic. Instead, they stayed mostly intact — and confident — this winter. Determined to end their World Series title drought in 2017 after coming so close the previous season, the AL Central champions were bounced in the playoffs by the New York Yankees despite taking a 2-0 series lead. It was a bitter finish for a team that won 102 games and reeled off 22 straight victories. But while there was a sense of finality for some Cleveland fans, manager Terry Francona said these Indians aren't done. ""I don't think anybody should be pessimistic right now,"" Francona said last month. ""My goodness, we have the best record in the American League the last five years. This has been a good run of baseball, and I don't see that going anywhere."" With one of baseball's top rotations, anchored by two-time Cy Young winner Corey Kluber, the Indians are aiming to win their first Series since 1948 and end the majors' longest championship dry spell. NEW LOOK: Cleveland's power and bullpen were both drained during the offseason. The club chose not to re-sign first baseman Carlos Santana (23 homers, 79 RBIs) or outfielder Jay Bruce (36 homers, 101 RBIs with Indians, Mets) as free agents. Cleveland tried to offset those losses by adding first baseman Yonder Alonso, who changed the launch angle of his swing last season and connected for a career-high 28 homers. Reliever Bryan Shaw may have angered Indians fans with spurts of inconsistency, but he pitched in at least 74 games the past four seasons and took the ball whenever Francona asked. He's gone and so is side-armer Joe Smith leaving the Indians to fill two major relief spots this spring. ROOKIES TO WATCH: Technically, center fielder Bradley Zimmer is no longer a rookie after playing 101 games last season, but his first year was incomplete when he shattered his left hand sliding into first base in September. Zimmer's loss deprived the Indians one of one their best base-stealing threats in the offseason and forced Francona to move second baseman Jason Kipnis to center field. Switch-hitting catcher Francisco Meija struggled during 11 games last September, but the 21-year-old is the top prospect in Cleveland's organization and it may not be long before he's up permanently. THEY'RE SET: There are few, if any, middle infields better than shortstop Francisco Lindor and second baseman Jose Ramirez. The All-Stars affect the game offensively and defensively. Unfortunately, they both struggled at the plate in the division series, dooming the Indians. Ramirez's days at third base — he played 88 games there last season — appear to be over, but his versatility is a huge asset for Francona. THEY'RE NOT: Left fielder Michael Brantley remains a major question mark. The club exercised its $12 million contract option on him for this season, not knowing with certainty if he'll be available for the opener after undergoing ankle surgery. Brantley has played in just 101 games over the past two seasons and the Indians can't afford to go through another year with him being in their lineup regularly. ON DECK: Kluber, Carlos Carrasco (18-6) and Trevor Bauer (17-9) are locked into starting spots, leaving Josh Tomlin, Danny Salazar, Mike Clevinger and Ryan Merritt it to battle for two openings this spring. It's possible that Clevinger could wind up in the bullpen. With Brantley's status unclear, the Indians remain in the market for an outfielder to add depth. The club would like to secure Lindor long-term with a multiyear extension, but the 24-year-old and his agents have turned down previous deals and don't seem rushed to finalize one now. ___ For more AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A 5.4-acre park on the roof has a half-mile walking loop, an outdoor theater and gardens populated by dozens of mature trees. It’s an elevated park that has been compared to the High Line in New York. The tech offices that surround the center connect directly with the park, as does a gondola that will whisk visitors to the park for the sidewalk below. During a week in which the Trump administration has sought to put infrastructure on the agenda, the transit center, which was built with close to $600 million in federal money from the stimulus package during the Great Recession, is a rubber-meets-the-road test for America’s infrastructure plans. The center was built on top of a giant underground concrete box designed to be the San Francisco terminus for both CalTrain, the railway that runs through Silicon Valley to San Jose, and high-speed rail, which is meant to connect San Francisco with Los Angeles. Building the 1.3-mile tunnel that will bring the tracks into the station will take years and hundreds of millions of dollars.

To better help you anticipate rain and snow storms, Environment and Climate Change Canada is coming to iOS and Android.
The new WeatherCAN app supplies you with information directly from Canada's official weather source. The app includes a new high-resolution, zoomable radar with map so you can better anticipate the next big thunderstorm or blizzard. The radar is four times better than the ones currently available, according to The Star.
""With how much Canadians care about weather, I realized there was an opportunity to have a tool,"" Environmental Minister Catherine McKenna told The Star. 
When you open the app, type in your location or add a new one if you're not home to see current weather conditions over the next 24 hours. WeatherCAN includes current, hourly and 7-day forecasts for more than 10,000 locations in Canada.
WeatherCAN also includes detailed forecasts so you can plan ahead or turn on notifications to get alerted to incoming weather. 
The app gives users climate information and weather facts, too. For example, you can learn more about droughts with Canada's Drought Monitor and drought-prone regions. The menu includes a weather glossary to better understand meteorological events. 
WeatherCAN is available in English, French and some Indigenous symbols for northern locations. Units are also customizable between Metric and Imperial. 
WeatherCAN didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Josh Hill,"Two seasons ago, the Chicago Cubs historic World Series drought came to an end. The pain was over and the lovable losers were finally winners. Now the new World Series drought will enter a third year following a stunning loss in the NL Wild Card to the Colorado Rockies. It’s only a truly shocking loss if you look at the team names. Nothing about this last month for the Cubs suggests they should have made it into the postseason, and their season ending with a whimper is all the proof you need that this team wasn’t meant to hang. There will inevitably be grumbling about the idea of the Wild Card, and the optics of a team that won posted the best second-best record in the league not making the NLDS isn’t great but neither are the optics of anything the Cubs did up to this point. All Chicago had to do was win one of their last two — games they hosted at Wrigley — and couldn’t manage to do that. Don’t blame the Wild Card for the Cubs collapse, if anything thank it for saving us from whatever disaster that likely awaited against Milwaukee. Here’s a look at how things stand with one Wild Card game in the books: What’s Next For Chicago? A lot of reflection before making some big decisions this winter. Chicago desperately needs to figure out what’s going on with its pitching, a problem area that dates back to 2016. It seems every winter the Cubs are searching for a closer, but there are so many other areas of need to address. Will Yu Darvish remember how to be a starting pitcher? Can the Cubs find another top starter to really round out its rotation? Is there anyone on the market that can plug the holes in the bullpen? On top of all this will be the $400 million Bryce Harper question. Will the Cubs spend even more gobs of money to further pad a superteam that has played in one World Series since being anointed the next baseball dynasty? There are so many crucial questions big and small for the Cubs and that will be a defining narrative heading into a long offseason. What’s Next For Colorado? There will be downers among you that try to poo-poo the idea that the Rockies belong in the Postseason. Don’t let that negativity ruin what is an amazing team to watch. Colorado entered the postseason winning 9-of-11, including a tiebreaker game in Los Angeles last night. This was the Rockies third game in their third different city in as many days — that’s outrageous. The fact that they took a team that many thought would hold the No. 1 seed out of the running is about as big a confidence boost as a team can get. Going up against Milwaukee — a team that has similarly gotten hot at the right time — is going to be a damn fun series to watch. Christian Yelich is white hot right now and the Brewers have been infected with his swagger in ways that helped them surge to a 20-7 record in September. Colorado has proven, however, that it is battle tested and ready for a challenge. The Rockies already knocked off the second-best team in the National League and now have their sights set on toppling the Brewers as well. Di you watch this team on Tuesday night? Guys like Nolan Arenado and Trevor Story are Stars waiting to blossom under the bright lights of the postseason. They might not have it in them to pull off a miracle run to the World Series, but at the very least we should get one of the most entertaining series of the entire postseason right out of the gate.","FanSided Rockies stun Cubs in NL Wild Card, and now the real fun begins FanSided Two seasons ago, the Chicago Cubs historic World Series drought came to an end.

That’s the first recorded time the nation has had more pigs than people. Spain’s hog explosion has been driven by annual demand for millions of tons of pork products like its famously delicious jamón ibérico, the most expensive varieties of which can go for hundreds of dollars a pound. And it’s been pretty bad for the environment and caused a number of food safety scandals, according to the Guardian: The soaring pig population is a key factor in making livestock the fourth-largest generator of greenhouse gas emissions after transport, electricity generation and industry. Pig farming also consumes vast quantities of water in a country frequently affected by drought. With each pig consuming 15 litres a day, altogether the industry uses more water than the cities of Zaragoza, Seville and Alicante combined. Nitrates from the animals’ waste products are also beginning to contaminate ground water, environmentalists say. Pork production has also been hit by a series of food safety scandals. This year a police investigation was triggered when a customer returned a worm-riddled ham to a branch of the French supermarket chain Carrefour. Police uncovered a network of unscrupulous suppliers and more than 50 tonnes of ham that was destined for the incinerator but instead has been relabelled with new sell-by dates. Ham production in Spain has long had an association with animal welfare —as the Atlantic noted in 2011, scientific research has shown stressed livestock experience muscle glycogen breakdown and their meat is often full of stress hormones. Jamón production also relies on a complicated ecological balancing act on the part of Spanish farmers. However, as the Guardian wrote, there’s been a recorded increase of nine million hogs since 2013, demand habitually exceeds supply, and the Spanish pork sector has become much more industrialized. (Globally, meat production and factory farms in particular are huge sources of pollutants and greenhouse gas, though cattle is by far the worst variety of livestock for the environment.) Spain, though, is second fiddle to Denmark, which earlier this year was reported by European statistical agency Eurostat to have 215 pigs for every 100 residents.","There are now enough pigs in Spain that technically everyone could have one, and there’d be pigs to spare.

Mark Kaufman,"Cyclone Idai left death, destruction, and a sprawling inland sea in its wake. 
The powerful tropical cyclone which struck Mozambique last Thursday as the equivalent of a Category 2 or 3 hurricane with winds of around 100 mph has left at least 150 dead and 600,000 in need of help in the flooded nation said the EU, though the Associated Press reports over 300 fatalities as of March 21 when accounting for deaths in neighboring Zimbabwe.
The cyclone's widespread flooding in part overshadowed by simultaneous and historic flooding in the Midwest has left behind an inundated area some 200 square miles in size (518 square kilometers), with the inland sea reaching up to 15 miles wide, according to satellite images from the European Space Agency (ESA). 
The destruction is particularly severe around Mozambique's fourth largest city, Beira.

""The situation is terrible. The scale of devastation is enormous. It seems that 90 per cent of the area is completely destroyed,"" said the Red Cross's Jamie LeSueur, who is working in the region. 
Though there's little evidence showing that the planet is experiencing more cyclones and hurricanes, there is mounting evidence that illustrates these storms are growing stronger compared to storms in the 21st century.
What's more, cyclones, like any big storm today, can now carry more water: The world has warmed by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 Celsius, over the last century, and for every 1 degree C of warming, the atmosphere holds seven percent more water. 
Since the 1960s, only three tropical storms of category 3 or stronger have hit Mozambique, according to Weather.com.
When the total number of fatalities are confirmed and the great inland sea dissipates, Idai's rampage may end up being the worst storm on record in the Southern Hemisphere, the EU noted.","Cyclone Idai left death, destruction, and a sprawling inland sea in its wake.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","If you live along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, theres a good chance youve noticed a distinct lack of vibrant autumn foliage this year. From North Carolina to Pennsylvania, lots of trees are still green, while others have gone from green to brown. Western Marylands normally-fiery fall foliage is being described as disappointing and pretty drab, while recent reports from Pennsylvania and Virginia suggest forests in these states are past due for a color change. A plant physiologist at Appalachian State University described western North Carolinas foliage as the strangest Ive ever seen, while the Foliage Network, which provides regular fall foliage reports across the country, summed up the dismal state of affairs in an October 25 update on the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast thusly: Yeesh...This is truly a bizarre foliage season. So what the hells going on? The decline in light availability associated with winter is a primary cue for foliage to start changing color and trees to start dropping their leaves. But the weather also plays a role. The pump for fall colors is the cool nights and warm days, Anne Hairston-Strang, a forest hydrologist at Marylands Department of Natural Resources Forest Service told Earther. Cool temperatures and longer nights signal to trees that its time to stop producing green chlorophyll. As this photosynthetic pigment degrades, yellow and orange carotenoids present throughout the growing season are unmasked. For some trees, autumns changing light conditions also trigger the production red, pink, and purple anthocyanins. Hairston-Strang noted that the start of fall in Maryland was abnormally warm, which likely delayed the onset of color production. Summer into September was also very wet, which Hairston-Strang said can further delay fall colors and result in a less vibrant show. These conditions werent limited to Maryland. Across the Mid-Atlantic and into southern New England it was unusually warm and wet this summer, with conditions remaining swamp-like well into September. Michelle Stoll, a public information officer at the Virginia Department of Forestry, said her states leaves were definitely behind and pointed to the recent raininess as a likely culprit. There are other factors that might be contributing to garbage autumn in some locales. Frost damage can cause leaves to go right from green to brown. Drought during the growing season can also stress trees out, causing their leaves to drop without a color show, according to Kevin Smith, a plant physiologist with the U.S. Department of Agricultures Forest Service. Foliage diseases, which often infect trees in late spring or early summerand are also associated with very wet weather can have a similar effect. People know fall foliage being part of senescence or aging, and it is that, Smith told Earther. But its healthy aging. As for the effects of climate change? The frost-free season has been gradually lengthening across the Northeast, a trend thats expected to continue and could lead to more delayed seasons like this year. In New England, a combination of warmer and wetter winters is expected to threaten iconic color-producing trees like sugar maple, according to a recent government report. Smith noted there could be myriad potential effects, from changes in species composition to changes in the genetic makeup of the species present, but was reluctant to predict how that might impact future fall foliage displays. The good news for leaf peepers this year? The foliage in upstate New York and New England, while somewhat delayed due to the warmth, seems to have eventually made a vibrant showing. I have been following color in New Hampshire and Maine, and this has been a great year, Smith said. Its been pretty much on the money.","If you live along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, there’s a good chance you’ve noticed a distinct lack of vibrant autumn foliage this year.

SCOTT REYBURN,"“The problem these days is that wherever the exhibition is, whether it’s Beirut or Beijing, you see the same contemporary art again and again,” said Tom Eccles, director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at the Bard College, New York, one of the three international curators of “Like a Moth to a Flame.” “Overproduction and overdistribution are an issue.” “We thought it important to root the exhibition in a place,” added Mr. Eccles, who with his fellow curators aimed to create a portrait of Turin through objects that the city’s residents have collected over the centuries. The guest organizers were particularly struck by how many locals visited Turin’s Egyptian M useum, arguably the finest of its type in Europe. The curators of “Like a Moth to a Flame” borrowed numerous pieces from the museum, creating dramatic juxtapositions of ancient and modern in OGR Torino’s cavernous postindustrial spaces. Giddily asymmetrical mid-1970s “Bariesthesias” step sculptures by the Italian kinetic artist Gianni Colombo are memorably combined with a monumental second millennium BC black marble statue of the Egyptian lioness goddess Sekhmet. Photo A “Cementarmato” relief by Giuseppe Uncini was exhibited by the Milan dealer Galleria Tega at the Artissima fair. Credit Galleria Tega “We wanted to include in the show pieces that people would recognize,” said Mr. Eccles, referring to the statue. “The exhibition was aimed at the people of Turin rather than a global elite. We wanted to ask the question, What place does art have in our lives?” And what place does a commercial art fair have? Lasting four days, Artissima is generally regarded as Italy’s destination art fair. That it coincides with Piedmont’s truffle season always helps (though this year drought severely depleted supplies). This time round 206 galleries exhibited and 52,000 visitors attended, according to the organizers, slightly more than the slightly smaller rival MiArt fair held in Milan in April. Artissima “is always quite good and small. There is not the rush that we are so used to,” said Fatima Maleki, a London-based collector. “We have always found something special at that fair.” Like most of the world’s second-tier art fairs, Artissima emphasized its international credentials (62 percent of the exhibitors were non-Italian) and offered what it hoped would be an appealing mix of new art and neglected classics. For those interested in the latter, the Milan dealer Galleria Tega, for example, was showing wall sculptures of the Rome-based conceptual artist Giuseppe Uncini (1929-2008), including two of his admired “Cementarmato” reliefs, combining concrete and rusted iron wire. One, dating from 1962, sold at the fair for 250,000 euros, or about $290,000; another from 1959, is still available at €280,000. Photo “Untitled,” a 2017 silver gelatin print by Joanna Piotrowska. The London-based artist will be featured in a major show of new photography at MoMA in New York in 2018. Credit Courtesy the artist and Madragoa, Lisbon This was pretty much the maximum price level for sales at Artissima, most of the works being by living artists and priced at under €30,000. The Lisbon dealer Galeria Madragoa priced the black-and-white photographs of the London-based Joanna Piotrowska, who will feature in the “ Being: New Photography ” show next year at MoMA in New York, at less than $3,500. In Ms. Piotrowska’s recent “Frantic” series, the artist asked adult residents of Lisbon and Rio de Janeiro to construct “play houses” in their homes, with psychologically revealing and at times disturbing results. Three of these photographs sold to collections that already follow the artist’s work, according to Matteo Consonni, co-founder of Madragoa. “We had great curatorial response,” added Mr. Consonni, “but a cold reaction from a buying public that I found very conservative, quite an uncommon thing for Artissima.” Maybe drought and the dearth of truffles was making the public in Turin less receptive. But the paradoxes of today’s art world remain. For many people, contemporary art fairs and the cerebrally curated exhibitions in postindustrial spaces that accompany them have become a different world. That world could do worse than reach beyond its captive audience of collectors and curators, to what Ms. Steyerl, the ArtReview Power 100’s most influential person, describes as “art’s larger communities.” Turin, at least, has given it a go.

DAVE PHILIPPS,"The cost is enormous. Horses grazing private pastures are projected to cost taxpayers $1 billion overall. Adding the rest of the excess horses on the range would cost another $3 billion-plus. The bureau doesn’t have the money to do this, so it has urged lawmakers to consider options long banned. One would sterilize 98,000 mustangs in the wild. Another would put about that number of captive mustangs up for sale “without limitation,” meaning they could go to slaughter. Given past experience, most probably would. Other proposals include paying people $1,000 to adopt a horse. None of these costly options would be a lasting fix. Wild horse advocacy groups have blasted the plans and are preparing for a legal fight. In all likelihood, though, none of these ideas will make it out of Washington. Particularly unlikely is the slaughter option. No one in Congress wants to vote to turn an American symbol into sausage. This inertia leaves one other possibility that is becoming increasingly likely: starvation. If the herds grow too large, they will exhaust the land’s ability to sustain them. A drought or harsh winter will lead to a die-off. It has happened before. A recent die-off in Arizona suggests it is starting to happen again. Good, some might say; let nature take its course. But the conditions leading to a die-off would have an impact well beyond wild horses. If herds have exhausted the land, everything else suffers: native wildflowers and lizards, sage grouse and butterflies — as well as ranchers who rely on the same range and hunters who want to see thriving populations of deer and bighorn sheep. Lions may be the best way to avoid such a catastrophe. Despite what the bureau says, a working predator-prey relationship could thrive if we would let it. Lions hunted wild horses in North America for millions of years, and they still do. Biologists studying mustangs have had their research upended by lions eating their subjects. One University of Nevada study found that in several mountain ranges of the state, horses made up the majority of lion’s diets. Some lion mothers who were collared and tracked feasted almost entirely on mustangs, and taught their young to do the same. Another study found that during the summer lions kill a horse every other week. Biologists have documented valleys where just a few lions keep a herd in check. That kind of balance could be a boon not just for the wild horse program but for the entire Western ecosystem.",Wild mustangs are overrunning parts of the West. The government has failed to control them.

"USA TODAY, Gabe Lacques, USA TODAY","The Mariners have the longest active postseason drought in American sports (Photo: USA TODAY Sports) Bryce Harper, a National League MVP at 23, is a free agent at 26, peddling his services in an industry that’s grown to nearly $11 billion in annual revenues. His combination of skills, age and marketing cachet make him an excellent fit for any major league franchise. Even the Seattle Mariners. Harper, who has 184 career home runs and a lifetime.900 OPS, rejected a 10-year, $300 million contract offer from the Nationals in September, and is a good bet to set a new standard for the most lucrative contract in North American sports history. It may take weeks for that process to play out. In the meantime, USA TODAY Sports will examine why every team could use Harper’s services – some more than others, certainly some better-equipped to procure them. A case for Harper and the Mariners joining forces: On the field Perhaps you’ve heard: The Mariners have some job openings. Well, that’s one way to look at it. The other is that Seattle general manager Jerry Dipoto is strip-mining his club, taking several steps back from an 89-win season to re-tool, as is vogue these days. So Robinson Cano and James Paxton and Edwin Diaz are gone, and Edwin Encarnacion and Jay Bruce are here, though probably not for long. Third baseman Kyle Seager, the piece Dipoto probably wants to move most, is likely marooned in Seattle, with the market limited for.221 hitters with about $60 million remaining on their contract. As for the farm system? Oh, it ranked last in the major leagues by Baseball America at season’s end, though the additions of pitcher Justus Sheffield and outfielder Jarred Kelenic in the Paxton and Cano/Diaz deals should goose that standing a bit. Part of the reasoning in rebuilding now is that the Mariners are light years behind the Houston Astros, on the field and elsewhere, and it makes sense to recede as Houston continues to ride high. It makes sense, sure, but the question here is, just how long do the Mariners plan to hide from Houston? After all, the Astros retain a consensus top 10 farm system even after significant graduations to the big leagues the past five seasons. Perhaps they’ll experience a bit of brain drain after losing assistant GM Mike Elias and decision sciences maven Sig Mejdal to the Baltimore Orioles. That said, waiting out the Astros doesn’t appear a sound strategy. And while the Mariners are largely lauded for rebuilding and avoiding the “middle ground” that that’s allegedly the death of the modern club, the odds are also lengthy that they hit on a large collection of homegrown players just as the Astro window might open. Yes, forgive the Mariner fan if he or she feels a bit jaded by going all in on drafting and development. Since the franchise’s last playoff berth in 2001, the club has burned top six overall picks on Jeff Clement, Brandon Morrow, Dustin Ackley, Danny Hultzen, Mike Zunino and Alex Jackson. We’ll avoid the hindsight of mentioning eventual stars that the franchise bypassed, but suffice to say that if there’s a 21st-century Branch Rickey, he’s never held an office at Safeco Field. At some point, the Mariners will want some players. More young talent could come if they’re inclined to deal All-Star outfielder Mitch Haniger four years shy of free agency – and he’s pretty much their last blue chip asset from the 2018 squad. And if that happens, it’s hard to imagine how long it will take to rebuild faith and hope among Mariners fans. Off the field There’s no shortage of sophisticates among Mariners fans, with the base perched in a well-educated, progressive region that hatched many of the modern thinkers among baseball media and executives. This, also, is true: Mariners fans love their stars. Their 17-year playoff drought – the longest active streak in major North American sports – hasn’t been totally bereft of hope. They won 93 games in 2003-2004 as the prinicipals from their 116-win 2001 season slowly faded. From 2007-2018, they won at least 85 games five times, including 87-, 86- and 89-win seasons in 2014, ’16 and ’18. Mariners fans, understandably, did not respond to these intermittent bursts. After drawing 2.67 million in an 88-win 2007 season, attendance bottomed out at 1.72 million in 2012. When the club finished just a game out of a wild-card spot in 2014, they barely cracked 2 million. Those numbers would have been worse were it not for one man: Felix Hernandez. The 2010 Cy Young Award winner turned Safeco into a house of joy on days he pitched, the “King’s Court” filling the third base side with yellow shirts. That phenomenon peaked in 2012, when Hernandez threw a perfect game. Lookout Landing calculated that King Felix produced a 19% bump on days he started that year. Hernandez turns 33 in April and produced a 5.55 ERA during a 2018 campaign in which he was banished to the bullpen for a turn. In 2019, his starts will largely be A Thing if only to say goodbye, as he’ll earn $27 million in the final year of his contract. After that, what compelling reason will fans have to visit Safeco Field? And how low will attendance go in the time it takes the Mariners to tear down, and convince fans they’re a winner again? That’s not to say Harper will be an automatic drawing card during the lean years, certainly not at the level inspired by Ichiro and A-Rod and Junior and the Big Unit. Yet he’d certainly lend them considerable credibility – at the box office and otherwise – if and when the Mariners crawl back in the 89-win rent district. Last Slide Next Slide Can they pull it off? With a franchise valued at $1.45 billion and annual revenues of $288 million, as estimated by Forbes, the Mariners certainly have the cash. After Hernandez’s departure, pitcher Mike Leake, second baseman Dee Gordon and Bruce all fall off the books after 2020 – assuming they’re not dealt before then. Seager follows suit in 2021, leaving them plenty of flexibility to structure a Harper deal to both parties’ liking. With caps in place on both domestic and international spending, there’s only so much cash the Mariners can throw at drafting and development, anyway. Harper won’t play a game over the age of 30 until the 2023 season, by which time the Mariners’ wise and prudent rebuild should be bearing significant fruit. Right? Will it happen? Doubtful. Mariners ownership has clearly given Dipoto the green light to play hero ball with the franchise; building around a proven player would surely disrupt that narrative. Fair enough. Yet this current rebuild will almost certainly drive more fans away from SoDo, at a time sporting options in Seattle are about to increase. If it works, great – winning is always the ultimate balm. If it fails, well – the relevance hit the Mariners endure would be even harder to overcome.

KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"The remains of a house in Perryville, Mo., after a tornado. Credit Jon Durr/Getty Images Extreme weather events caused a total of $306 billion in damage in the United States last year, making 2017 the most expensive year on record for natural disasters in the country, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. A trio of major hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, contributed hundreds of billions to the total. But the year was seemingly mired in disaster, from a freeze in the Southeast that damaged fruit crops in March, to hail storms that whipped across Colorado, Oklahoma and other central states in May, to the tornadoes that struck the Midwest in June. Unusual consequences of extreme weather could be found all over the map. Thirteen cows died in a field in Pennington County, S.D., after ingesting anthrax spores from the soil; they had changed their grazing patterns during a drought that lasted much of the year in South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana. The cows’ demise was a small part of the $2.5 billion of damage that struck the three states. In all, there were 16 natural disasters that caused more than $1 billion of damage in 2017. In 1980, when NOAA first started tallying records, there were three, adjusted for inflation. Scientists cannot always say with certainty that a given natural disaster was influenced by climate change. But some may be related to warming, and the contiguous United States experienced its third-warmest year on record in 2017. The temperature average was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, said Jake Crouch, a climate scientist from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center.

[ New York Times] And Finally … The New York Times asked readers to share with California Today their experiences fleeing the fires in Los Angeles and Ventura. Here, lightly edited, are some of the responses. “My husband and I along with our 18-month-old fled our house Wednesday morning on Casiano Drive. As we left, embers were falling from the sky and helicopters were flying low overhead spraying water. A completely surreal experience. We just bought our house in April. It’s our dream home. And as I type this, a house right next door to our neighbor’s is in flames. I’m not sure if our house will make it, but thankfully we are all safe.” — Lisa Goh “I got the emergency alert on my phone of fire at 5 something in the morning. I saw an alert of a six-acre fire near Mulholland Drive, east of the 405. That’s just a couple of miles away. By 6:15 the fire had reached 50 acres and I was already packing bags and calling my husband who is on business in Boston. By 6:30 I knew for sure we had to get out of there. I told our two nannies to wake up immediately and get their bags packed as well as the kids bags packed. I told them to pack as if we would never see this house again.” — Gwen Gottlieb “After dinner in Westlake, we were driving home down the grade and saw the red glow of the fires. It was awful and we just prayed for all in its path. Thirty minutes later we arrived in Ventura and the streetlights flickered. Then the entire city went dark. At that point we figured it was from the fires and headed inside. Not 20 minutes later I looked out my bedroom window and saw the red glow extremely close. I told my daughters we need to start gathering items as it must be spreading. Within minutes I saw the fire crest our hill and it was panic. We literally had minutes to get anything we could grab along with our pets (including our one week old kittens and a nursing Mom) and leave. We headed to Oxnard Shores to my fiancé’s parents’ home. At that point the entire mountain range of Ventura was ablaze.” — Stephanie Jensen Want to submit a photo for possible publication? You can do it here.

Katherine Lam,"WARNING: ARTICLE CONTAINS GRAPHIC IMAGE Nearly 200 horses were found dead in a stock pond on Navajo land in Arizona after widespread drought and famine hit the area, officials said. About 191 wild horses died of natural causes in the pond in Gray Mountain, Navajo Nation Vice President Jonathan Nez said in a news release. Nez and Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye went to the scene to assess the incident last Wednesday. “These animals were searching for water to stay alive. In the process, they unfortunately burrowed themselves into the mud and couldn’t escape because they were so weak,” Nez said in the news release. The horses will be buried onsite after they were found dead in a stock pond. (Navajo Nation) The horses will be buried onsite. Officials will be spreading hydrated lime to speed up decomposition before they are buried. The pond will then be permanently closed and covered and a new watering hole will be created at a different location. This isn’t the first time dozens of horses were found dead near a watering pond. Officials said the incident was a seasonal issue as Navajo communities attempt to solve their growing wild horse population. The Navajo Nation — territory that covers parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah — has an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 feral horses on the land. Navajo Nation officials said the ecosystem cannot support the amount of horses. “This tragic incident exemplifies the problem the Navajo Nation faces in an overpopulation of feral horses,” Begaye said. Arizona has been experiencing an unusual dry spell after a winter with little rain and snow. About 10 percent of Arizona is seeing exceptional drought, AZCentral reported. The forecast for the next three months also doesn’t offer much hope for more rain to quell the drought. Katherine Lam is a breaking and trending news digital producer for Fox News.

The Canadian Press,"ATLANTA The players bounced up and down on a hastily erected stage in the middle of the field, confetti falling all around as they hoisted the championship trophy. It's a familiar scene at the end of any season. Only this time, a team from Atlanta was doing the honours. The title drought in over in the A-T-L. Josef Martinez and Franco Escobar scored goals, Brad Guzan came up with a couple of clutch saves and Atlanta United gave the city its first championship since 1995 with a 2-0 victory over the Portland Timbers in the MLS Cup final Saturday night. Cheered on by the largest crowd in franchise history, United captured the crown in just its second season to set off a huge celebration in a city that has known so much sporting heartbreak. Owner Arthur Blank lifted a trophy and got soaked with champagne less than two years after his other team, the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, squandered a 25-point lead in an epic Super Bowl collapse. ""My first night in my new house in Atlanta, I went to bed at halftime of the Super Bowl,"" defender Jeff Larentowicz said. ""I woke up and I read the headlines and I couldn't believe what I saw."" Now, United had written a new headline. Champs. ""Hopefully, we can transcend that past,"" Larentowicz said, ""and move on to a new future for the city."" Martinez, capping the greatest goal-scoring season in MLS history, put United ahead in 39th minute. Escobar added an insurance goal in the 54th, turning the final minutes into a raucous, flag-waving celebration and sending coach Tata Martino out with a title in his final game as coach. He's reportedly headed to Mexico to take over as that country's national coach. ""If I had to choose the way to leave somewhere, this is the best way,"" Martino said. ""This is the way I wanted it to happen."" Atlanta reveled in its first title since the Braves won the 1995 World Series a gap of 8,442 days, for those counting. ""Most of us aren't from here, so we don't know the pain that they've been through,"" said United captain Michael Parkhurst, who finally broke his own drought after playing on four runner-up teams. ""I'm just happy that we could come through for them tonight. I know there were a lot of anxious and stressed-out fans."" After a surprising run in the playoffs, the Timbers were denied their second MLS championship after winning the cup in 2015. They prevailed on the road at Dallas, Seattle and Kansas City before coming up short in Atlanta. ""I'm extremely proud of the work we've had the entire season,"" coach Giovanni Savaarese said. ""To be able to get to the MLS Cup, we played a lot of difficult teams."" Since major league sports came to Atlanta in 1966, the only other team to win a championship in one of the five major sports also came on the soccer pitch. The Atlanta Chiefs claimed the title in the North American Soccer League's inaugural season in 1968. While that team laid the groundwork, Atlanta United carried the sport to unprecedented levels in North America. The team shattered the MLS attendance record a year ago in its first season, and then took the mark even higher by averaging more than 53,000 per game this year a level of support that would fit right in with the Premier League or La Liga. The crowd of 73,019 on Saturday easily eclipsed the previous record for an MLS Cup 61,316 at New England's Gillette Stadium in 2002. Almost as soon as the final whistle blew, a victory parade through the streets of Atlanta was announced for Monday. Queen's ""We Are The Champions"" blared throughout Mercedes-Benz Stadium. ""The first goal is always going to be massive one way or the other,"" Guzan said. ""The second one really broke their backs."" United kept the ball in Portland's end of the field much of the first half. It seemed only a matter of time before Atlanta broke through. Appropriately enough, it was Martinez. Portland tried to clear the ball, but a sliding tackle by Parkhurst sent the ball rocketing back toward the Timbers net. Martinez managed to win possession from Jeremy Ebobisse at the top of the area, leaving the most prolific goal scorer in league history all alone against goalkeeper Jeff Attinella. It was no contest. Martinez, the league's MVP and Golden Boot winner after scoring 31 goals during the regular season, cut to his right to escape the sprawling keeper, easily sliding the ball into an open net to send the packed house into an uproar. ""I was feeling a lot of pressure before the game,"" said Martinez, who added four more goals in the playoffs. ""My neighbours were putting flags all around my house and pushing notes under my door."" The Timbers finally created a scoring chance in the 42nd minute. Looking to atone for his mistake, Ebobisse slipped in behind the defence and was all alone in front for a cross. His header was right on the mark, but Guzan dove to his right to punch it away with both hands. It was Portland's only shot of the opening half. The Timbers created far more opportunities over the final 45 minutes, but couldn't get it past Guzan. Escobar was the one who finished off the Timbers. MVP finalist Miguel Almiron sent a free kick into the box, where Martinez managed to get a head on it. His attempt was heading wide of the net, but Escobar slipped free at the far post to deliver a sliding goal. The defender's second score of the playoffs doubled his goal output for the entire regular season. ""It's not every day you get to win a title,"" Guzan said, speaking for an entire city. ""To be a part of this is truly special.""","Atlanta United beats Timbers to capture MLS Cup TSN Atlanta United wins MLS Cup in second season, ends city's sports title drought CNN Atlanta United 2-0 Portland Timbers: MLS Cup final – as it happened The Guardian Major League Soccer eyes expansion, commiss…",2018-12-09T03:03:19Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Www.tsn.ca'}",Atlanta United beats Timbers to capture MLS Cup - TSN,https://www.tsn.ca/atlanta-united-beats-timbers-to-capture-mls-cup-1.1223276,https://www.tsn.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1223361!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/atlanta-united-celebrates.jpg,,Www.tsn.ca,drought,1

"USA TODAY Sports, Scott Gleeson, USA TODAY Sports","SportsPulse: From San Antonio, our college basketball experts break down Loyola Chicago's chances of pulling off the unthinkable and getting to the national championship game. USA TODAY Sports Loyola Ramblers center Cameron Krutwig (25) shoots against Michigan Wolverines forward Moritz Wagner (13) in the first half in the semifinals of the 2018 men's Final Four at Alamodome. (Photo: Jamie Schwaberow, USA TODAY Sports) SAN ANTONIO — Loyola-Chicago has seized control of its national semifinal matchup against Michigan, leading 29-22 at halftime in the Final Four. The Ramblers, as good of a shooting team as any in these NCAAs, haven't shot many three-pointers (they're 0-for-3 from beyond the arc). But they've relentlessly attacked Michigan and scored in the paint. Big man Cameron Krutwig has been particularly effective, using his old-school post moves to score on Michigan's Moe Wagner. And Marques Townes' quickness (eight points) has been on display early on as well. Loyola has also gotten a nice boost from its bench with Aundre Jackson chipping in eight first-half points. The Wolverines, meanwhile, have been cold. They went more than seven minutes without scoring a field goal during a drought, and are only in the game because big man Wagner has taken advantage of the Ramblers' lack of size. The 6-11 forward has a double-double (11 points, 11 boards) through the first half. But Loyola hasn't made it easy for him to get the ball. Michigan shot just 2-for-13 from three-point range in the first half.

"AP, AP","Whenever Eric Desjardins reunites with his 1993 Montreal Canadiens teammates, the topic of Canada's ongoing Stanley Cup drought doesn't come up in conversation.
""We don't see it that way. Canadian team, American team, it's just that we were part of the NHL,"" the former star defenseman said. ""Sure, it's been a while in Montreal, but we don't really talk about the 26 years.""
That's right. With the NHL playoffs set to open Wednesday, it will be going on 26 years since the Canadiens or any other Canadian team brought home the Cup.
Desjardins, who enjoyed a 17-year career split between Montreal and Philadelphia, chalks up the drought to NHL expansion across the United States and league-wide parity ushered in with the introduction of the salary cap in 2005.
""It's supposed to be our national sport, and we're supposed to be the best at it,"" said Desjardins, who's from Montreal. ""But now, the way the league's structured I think it could go anywhere. ... I think anybody can win it now. And I think it makes it more interesting.""
Still, the 49-year-old acknowledged a quarter century between Cups in Canada is far too long, and Desjardins can see himself rooting for any Canadian team making it to this year's Final.
""If the Final's between Pittsburgh and Winnipeg, yeah I would root, even though I like Pittsburgh,"" he said. ""But yeah, against Calgary, Winnipeg, I would cheer for the Canadian team.""
Canada's Cup hopes this spring rest on three teams Calgary, Winnipeg and Toronto to end the drought. Of course, most current Canadian-born NHL players weren't alive to see Desjardins and Co. celebrate their five-game series win over the Wayne Gretzky-led Los Angeles Kings.
Sabres forward Jason Pominville is among the exceptions.
He was 10 when his hometown Habs won, and Pominville still vividly recalls Game 2 of the series in which Desjardins scored all three goals in Montreal's 3-2 overtime win after the Canadiens lost the opener.
""I remember watching that and celebrating in my living room, and fist-pumping when he scored,"" Pominville said. ""I was a big fan of Gretzky, too. But when you're in Montreal, it's tough not to root for that team when you're growing up.""
In Montreal, there was a time when winning the Cup was considered a birthright. The Canadiens still top the list with 24 championships, 23 coming after the NHL was founded in 1917.
And yet, Montreal hasn't reached the Final since '93, while only five Canadian teams have done so; Vancouver is the only one to make two appearances during the drought, in 1994 and 2011.
Then there are the Maple Leafs, who haven't reached the Final since winning the Cup in 1967, the last year of the NHL's Original Six era.
The low point might have been the 2016 playoffs, the first since 1970 to not feature a Canadian team
This was not always the case. From 1927 to 1995, the lengthiest stretch for a Canadian team not appearing in the Final was two years. It last happened in 1991-92, when Pittsburgh won consecutive championships by beating Minnesota and Chicago.
As for Canada's lengthiest Cup drought before the '93 Habs, it was a six-year span from 1936-41.
The current drought has gone on for so long, former executive-turned broadcaster Brian Burke said the math simply doesn't add up.
""It doesn't make sense. There's 31 teams, so seven out of 31 teams, a Canadian team should win every four-and-a-half years,"" said Burke, who has worked in the front offices in Vancouver, Toronto and Calgary.
The problem, Burke said, is Canadian teams are at a disadvantage because many players don't want to play north of the border for several reasons.
The first, he said, is a lack of privacy and the amount of pressure placed on players to win north of the border. Burke said a large number of players, including Canadians, often list all seven Canadian teams on the no-trade clauses of their contracts.
""Even in Calgary, we had our lists where players got to put 10 teams on a no-trade list, and all the Canadian teams were on those lists,"" he said.
The second issue is Canada's taxation rate.
""There's no privacy. Horrible personal criticisms on social media, and then you take home way less money, so it's pretty easy,"" Burke said.
He can only imagine how much national attention will be paid to the next Canadian team to win it all.
""The next GM that wins a Cup in Canada, they'll be naming schools after him, and streets,"" Burke said.
Don't think Flames GM Brad Treliving hasn't given ending the drought some thought.
""Hey, that's all you dream about,"" he said, while attempting to keep the pressures of winning in Canada in perspective.
""You got to bed at night and it's no different than any other manager or any other person involved in the game: That's what you want to accomplish"" Treliving said. ""If you really put the energy and the effort into doing the right things, the results will come.""
Having lost in the Final twice, Desjardins can't remember a sweeter moment than winning the Cup.
""It's a reward that's indescribable,"" Desjardins said. ""When you win, you can share it. You share it with your teammates, you share it with the coaching staff.""
In Canada, it will be shared with an entire nation.

John Rogers,"The so-called Camp Fire in Northern California in many ways has become the worst wildfire in the history of a state whose topography and climate have long made it ripe for devastating blazes. With terrain ranging from steep, tree-topped mountains to dry, brush-covered hillsides, and matched with a climate that frequently varies from light rainy seasons to drought years, California has been home to deadly, destructive wildfires since record-keeping began in the early 20th century. Figuring out just how bad a wildfire is requires taking into account several statistics, including not only lives lost and homes destroyed but other buildings burned and the amount of forest, timberland and brush laid to waste. A look at what makes for the worst wildfire and where the most recent blaze falls in those categories: DEADLIEST CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES The Camp Fire, which destroyed the historical mining town of Paradise, is the most deadly in state history, with 84 fatalities as of Friday, according to statistics from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Its also the deadliest in the U.S. in a century. With hundreds of people still reported missing, the death count is likely to rise. The states second-deadliest wildfire, Los Angeles 1933 Griffith Park blaze, killed 29 people, most of them workers hired under a Depression-era Works Progress Administration program to widen roads and build trails in the sprawling wilderness park on the edge of downtown Los Angeles. Those workers had no experience fighting fires and no water readily available when flames erupted. They became trapped in a canyon when they tried to stop it with shovels and their feet by stomping on hot spots. The Tunnel Fire of 1991 killed 25 when it roared down the densely populated hillsides of Oakland, trapping people in homes and on narrow, winding streets. This third-deadliest wildfire began as a small blaze that firefighters thought they had contained, only to see it roar back to life when smoldering embers ignited other brush as fierce winds erupted. LARGEST CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES The Mendocino Complex Fire last year blackened more than 459,000 acres, or 717 square miles (1,857 square kilometers), much of it in the Mendocino National Forest, making it the largest in state history, state statistics say. Thats nearly triple the size of the Camp Fire that has consumed more than 153,000 acres, or 240 square miles (620 square kilometers). But only one person died in the 2017 blaze. Last years Thomas Fire, which scorched about 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometers) in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, is the states second largest. It killed two people. The Cedar Fire, which roared across about 427 square miles (1,106 square kilometers) in 2003, was the largest in state history at the time and is now the third largest. It is also the fifth deadliest. The blaze, which began in the Cleveland National Forest, killed a firefighter and 14 other people. Most were residents of a rural San Diego County canyon who didnt have time to outrun the wind-driven flames. Currently the Camp Fire is 16th on this list. MOST DESTRUCTIVE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES This statistic is based on total structures destroyed, including homes, businesses and other buildings. The Camp Fire is far and away the leader with nearly 19,000 buildings lost, including 13,954 homes. Last years Tubbs Fire, which burned through California wine country, is a distant second at 5,636 structures. Its also the states fourth-deadliest wildfire, having claimed 22 lives. The third deadliest, Oaklands Tunnel Fire, is also the third most destructive, claiming 2,900 buildings. ARE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES GETTING WORSE? Statistically, it would appear so. Fifteen of the 20 most destructive California wildfires have occurred in the past 20 years. During that same period, 10 of the states 20 deadliest wildfires have broken out, including four in just the past two years. Sixteen of the states 20 largest wildfires have erupted since 1998. ___ Rogers reported from Los Angeles.","The so-called Camp Fire in Northern California in many ways has become the worst wildfire in the history of a state whose topography and climate have long made it ripe for devastating blazes.

Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan,"This week, scientists from Harvard, MIT, Princeton, and the NOAA published a paper in the influential journal Nature Communications matter-of-factly discussing the possibility of “solar geoengineering,” or dimming the sun to slow the melt of global ice and the mass extinction of species on Earth. “The idea is simple,” wrote the researchers behind a separate Harvard project that will test one such sun-dimming technology this year. “Spray a bunch of particles into the stratosphere, and they will cool the planet by reflecting some of the Sun’s rays back into space.” Thanks to us, the star that has nurtured life on Earth for millions of years is now a big liability.

It’s hard to say if that’s why videos of Sol, the artist Daniel Rozin‘s show at New York’s bitforms gallery, look almost ominous. The show, which includes three pieces from 2019, builds on Rozin’s past interactive work; each piece is in the vein of his “Mirror” works, which are made up of a dense collection of 3D cameras and motors that sense the bodies of visitors and reflect their form back to them as they move around the art.
In one piece, Cracked Mud, shards of brown ceramic arranged to look like a drying riverbed ripple around a glowing orb of light.
Another, called Sunset Mirror, is a digital screen showing a time-lapse of a sunset. Visitors control the speed of the sun’s arc by moving around the piece.
The third piece, called Fabric Mirror, is a cascade of fabrics in gold and deep red, folded and pinned into a complex drapery that shimmers and rearranges itself as visitors walk by. The gold, origami-esque shapes seem to reference the Space Age.

Mark Kaufman,"Fire has returned to California's wine country as the flames thrive on bounties of parched land. The County Fire began on Saturday afternoon and since then has devoured over 1,000 acres of land each hour. As of Tuesday morning, the Golden State's largest fire had spread over 70,000 acres in Yolo County and into the edges of Napa County. The return of fire to the region, which cast ominous, orange glows over San Francisco to the south, is especially unwelcome after last October's firestorms in the region, which were the deadliest in the state's history. SEE ALSO: A landmark climate change ruling could go up in smoke after Justice Kennedy retires But such a fire — ultimately produced by a grim mix of dry land, hot temperatures, and gusty winds — wasn't unexpected. Fire managers knew there was "" significant fire potential "" here. Any spark could turn into a nasty conflagration due to the exceptional amount of parched vegetation, or fuel, just waiting to burn. ""There's indications we have record fuel loading right now,"" Brenda Belongie, lead meteorologist of the U.S. Forest Service's Predictive Services in Northern California, said in an interview. ""There's lots of dry grasses."" ""Grass is a big fire curator,"" said Belongie. ""You add wind to that and you’ve got a good combination."" In the short term, grasses have just shot up this April, when the region received some much-needed rain after a drier winter. ""Timing is everything, said Belongie. ""We got rain in April which allowed the grass crop to just explode."" But grasses in past years have also proved to be big fuel contributors. Specifically, an abundance of grasses and other vegetation from the previous winter (2016-2017) were left to burn. This vegetation flourished after that profoundly rainy winter, one of California's wettest on record. And that winter was followed by another extreme: The state's hottest summer ever recorded. All this vegetation proceeded to dry out, and was then followed by April's growth. ""It's last year's leftovers and this year's additions,"" said Belongie. A caravan of fire trucks en route to the County Fire on July 2, 2018. Image: JOHN G. MABANGLO/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock But that's not all. Much of the land burned by the Country Fire, as well as the Pawnee Fire to the north, ""has not burned in decades,"" Gregory Giusti, a former forestry researcher for California's Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, said over email. In short, decades of built-up vegetation, or fuel, has not been naturally thinned out by normal wildfire events. ""I don’t believe any of the acres currently burning have been impacted by the past fires so the fuel loads [grasses and vegetation] are heavy,"" said Giusti. The result of all this fuel, combined with weather conditions, has proven incendiary. ""This is certainly unprecedented fire growth for this time of year,"" Gabe Lauderdale, a public information officer for Cal Fire, the state's fire protection agency, said in an interview. Lauderdale notes that later in the season, like September, is when the land is even drier and more susceptible to large fires. A fire like this in early July, however, ""is not unknown,"" said Belongie. Along with dry fuel and the shape of the land (""fire loves to run uphill""), the third factor of windy or hot weather can come at anytime, and stoke surges of fire. ""Weather is like the two-year-old in the group — it's constantly changing,"" she said. Fortunately, the land burning so far is largely undeveloped. ""Though that is no comfort for those who do live the in fire's path,"" said Giusti. California may be increasingly susceptible to loads of dried-out grasses in the future. Climate scientists say to prepare for periods of alternating extremes of grim drought and winter deluges — just like the abrupt transition from the state's worst drought on record (2012-2016) to a winter rife with flooding. This means loads of vegetation will shoot up, but might soon become parched for years at a time under the famously sunny, and often cloudless, California sky.","Fire has returned to California's wine country as the flames thrive on bounties of parched land.

CBSDenver,"DENVER (AP) — Extreme fire danger prompted officials to shut down a sprawling forest that includes some of Colorado’s most stunning mountains in a region that attracts tourists from around the world, a rare tactic also being used in neighboring states as the U.S. Southwest struggles with severe drought. National forests and parks in Arizona and New Mexico have already been shut down as precautions. San Juan National Forest officials in southwestern Colorado closed hundreds of miles of trails and thousands of miles of back roads to hikers, bikers, horseback riders and campers Tuesday to prevent the possibility of an abandoned campfire or any other spark from starting a wildfire. It’s the first full closure of a national forest in Colorado since 2002, which was another very dry year. (credit: USFS) The closure will remain until sufficient precipitation eases the fire danger. The move comes as the residents of over 2,000 homes have been forced to evacuate because of the 416 Fire that started June 1 in the forest that has burned about 31 square miles. It is 15 percent contained. Another fire nearby, the Burro Fire, has burned about 4 square miles. Authorities are still investigating how the fire started. No homes have been lost although the fire came close to buildings Sunday night, authorities said. Fire managers credited advance fire mitigation work by homeowners for helping firefighters save the structures. (credit: CBS) Much of the U.S. West is experiencing some level of drought and the Four Corners region — where Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado meet — is at the center of a large patch of exceptional drought. In New Mexico, the Santa Fe National Forest, along with portions of three national park sites, closed June 1 because of the fire danger. The Santa Fe forest is among New Mexico’s most popular getaways. The U.S. Forest Service also is planning to bar recreation in a handful of ranger districts in the Cibola National Forest outside of Albuquerque beginning Friday. Portions of national forests in Arizona were also closed in late May because of severe fire conditions. Full forest closures are not common and the Forest Service stresses they’re only done as a last resort. Burro Fire (credit: San Juan National Forest) The Coconino National Forest in Arizona shut down completely because of fire danger in 2006 for nine days. A 2002 shutdown lasted nine weeks, including both Memorial Day and July 4 holidays, and other national forests had closures that year. Colorado’s latest closure will also bar non-recreational uses, although ranchers, for example, who use some of the forest’s over 2,800 square miles for grazing will be able to seek exemptions, San Juan National Forest spokeswoman Cam Hooley said. If any exemptions are granted, those users would be required to take precautions, such as carrying water, shovels and fire extinguishers and possibly only allowed in during certain times of the day, she said. “We recognize that this is difficult for the local businesses and the local economy and just ask that people just be understanding and patient,” Hooley said. The region, which is also home to Mesa Verde National Park, relies heavily on visitors to support its economy and fire managers have tried to help encourage them to keep coming by including links to tourism information in their regular fire updates. One of the main tourist attractions, a historic scenic railroad that takes riders through the majestic San Juan Mountains in the forest, has suspended its service and furloughed its seasonal workers. It may reopen later this month with diesel engines to replace its traditional coal-fired locomotives that can throw sparks. Sweetie Marbury, the mayor of nearby Durango — about 10 miles from the fire — said there are plenty of things people can do in the area, including river rafting, cycling and fishing and learning about history at places like Mesa Verde and Chimney Rock National Monument. She noted that the city did recover from a huge spill of wastewater from an old gold mine in 2015. “We are resilient in Durango. We bounce back,” she said.

"AP, AP","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) Danny Willett ended his title drought in thrilling fashion, winning the DP World Tour Championship by two shots despite a last-hole blunder on Sunday. It was the 31-year-old Englishman's first victory since the 2016 Masters, secured with a final-round 4-under-par 68 for an 18-under total of 270. Francesco Molinari finished in joint 26th place to win the European Tour's Race to Dubai. Molinari, winner of the Open Championship and the BMW PGA Championship this year, secured the title when his closest rival Tommy Fleetwood failed to win the tournament. Willett held a two-shot lead on the 18th tee after making a birdie on the 17th, but pushed his tee shot slightly into the bank of a creek that divides the 18th fairway, and then hit a brave second shot from the rocks before making par.

Joshua Emerson Smith,"After the Camp Fire obliterated the town of Paradise this month in Californias most horrific wildfire to date, everyone from President Trump to Gov. Jerry Brown raised concerns about the states overgrown and drought-stricken forests. Both administrations called for a significant increase in logging on federal and private lands earlier this year to thin timberland characterized as tinderboxes ready to explode. However, according to research scientists and ecologists, wildfires increasing toll on life and property in recent years has been overwhelmingly driven by global warming and patterns of development not the states most densely wooded areas. The fires that are getting everybodys attention right now are not about forest management, said Leroy Westerling, a professor and researcher specializing in global warming and wildfire at the University of California at Merced. The major factor is climate change across the west, he added. Regardless of fuels management, we just wouldnt be burning like this, especially in Northern California, in a normal year. In fact, few if any of Californias most destructive blazes dating back to the early 20th century have been driven by densely packed forests, according to a review of records kept by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. The most devastating and deadly conflagrations have most often resulted from high winds whipping fire through dried out chaparral and grasslands. These blazes often torch sprawling subdivisions that abut undeveloped landscapes, such as the Tubbs Fire did in Santa Rosa last fall. The major factor is climate change across the west. Regardless of fuels management, we just wouldnt be burning like this... in a normal year. — Leroy Westerling, a professor and researcher at the University of California at Merced Even the Camp Fire, which occurred in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, spread on strong westerly winds blowing down from the mountains across heavily logged forests before jumping from house to house. Trees were one of the only things that remained intact after walls of flame swept through the town of Paradise. Researchers call for change amid the status quo Now a chorus of academics and ecology and policy experts have spoken out across the state from Stanford University to Sonoma State University to University of California at Santa Barbara calling on regional governments to tighten zoning rules and even consider buying people out of homes in fire-prone areas. Weve got to do something smarter than what weve been doing, said Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College, who has proposed the creation of flood and fire bonds that would allow local governments to purchase and set aside property in high-fire areas. Backstory: Reporting on wildfire, logging and climate change » This is very clear. Get people out of there. Go back to the cities and towns and counties, planning boards and zoning commissions and have a very different approach, Miller added. However, the opposite seems to be happening throughout the state. For example, residents in parts of Santa Rosa that burned in 2017 have started to rebuild. And in San Diego County, officials have approved several sprawling new suburban developments despite the concerns of environmental groups and several lawsuits. Our experience shows wildfires burn right into the city of San Diegos long-established neighborhoods, so halting new suburban home building is no panacea, said county Supervisor Ron Roberts, whos held the post since 1995 and also sits on the states California Air Resources Board. The projects this board has recently approved meet stringent, modern fire safety standards, and during our public, televised deliberations, fire authorities responded positively during extensive questioning about their confidence in the safety of those developments, Roberts added. Those in Southern California are used to bracing for dry fall seasons when so-called Santa Ana winds create dangerous fire conditions. Using the latest technology in building materials and clearing defensible space around homes are established practices. Still such precautions only go so far, such as in the recent Woolsey Fire that rushed through scrublands on high winds destroying homes from Oak Park to the opulent Malibu coast. Northern California now also appears to be increasingly facing this dangerous recipe for wildfire, said Noah Diffenbaugh, an earth science professor at Stanford University and the senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. Autumn precipitation has been decreasing, and is likely to decrease in the future as global warming continues, he said. So when those winds occur, theyre occurring over a backdrop of record dry vegetation. Pressure ramps up to log the forest Much of the official government narrative around wildfire in California has centered on the more than 129 million dead and dying trees ravaged by drought and bark beetles that are scattered across the state. Officials have repeatedly pointed to forests that have turned an ominous red and gray, especially in the central and southern Sierra Nevada as evidence that forests pose a threat. Timeline: Californias intense tree mortality follows a culture of fire suppression driven by logging interests » On Tuesday, Trump called on congress to pass legislation that would dramatically expand the federal governments authority to remove dead and dying trees as well as salvage logging following wildfires. The move comes just days after U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke blamed radical environmentalists for preventing adequate management of forests, telling Breitbart News: You have dead and dying timber. You have years of neglect. It was like a flamethrower of embers shooting through the forest. The comments echo recent statements made by House Republicans such as Rep. Tom McClintock, whose district covers much of the southern and central Sierra Nevada. In the name of protecting endangered species, we placed increasing tracts of land off limits to forest management, allowing our forests to become dangerously overcrowded and overgrown, he said in October at a meeting of the Tuolumne County Alliance for Resources and Environment, a group that among other things advocates for logging on public lands. Brown has repeatedly blamed climate change for the recent fires while reiterating concerns about overgrown forests. The president has talked about how our forests are managed. Thats an element, Brown said in recent national news broadcast, after surveying wildfire damage with Trump. The fact is that managing the forest is part of it, he added, while also acknowledging the role of climate change. Theyre a lot denser than they were 200 years ago. Over the last two years, top forestry and firefighting officials have spent countless hours in public and private meetings discussing how to address overgrown timberland and their potentially catastrophic threat. The fact is that managing the forest is part of it. Theyre a lot denser than they were 200 years ago. — Gov. Jerry Brown, after survey wildfire damage with President Trump While the states most destructive and deadly fires are largely not associated with current forest conditions, some researchers fear that could change in the future. As those dead logs fall on top of one another, they can jackstraw and create the conditions for wildfires of unprecedented scale, said Malcolm North, a research ecologist with the Forest Service. People will say that usually those big logs dont burn, but ten years from now you could get a fire in the concentrated down wood, he said, and if that happens, were going to see fires that weve never seen the likes of before. Chad Hanson, a research ecologist with the Earth Island Institute's John Muir Project, dismissed the argument as an excuse to prop up the logging industry. He said that removing dead trees, known as snags, would likely increase the chance of a large fire. I have to say that it's shocking to me that scientists funded by the Forest Service would push snag removal as fire management right now, after the Camp fire just blew through an area where the Forest Service had removed nearly all of the snags and then burned down most of Paradise, he said. Forest Service official countered, saying that efforts to increase logging will be based on the best science. Its for restoration of the forest ecosystem, to protect it from catastrophic wildfire and insect and disease outbreak, said John Exline, ecosystem management director with the Pacific southwest region of the Forest Service. Its a combination of everyone rolling up their sleeves and working together. Noah Berger/The New York Times Standing dead trees, called snags, in an area burned in the Rim Fire in California, July 7, 2016. A scientific debate is intensifying over whether too much money and too many lives are lost fighting forest fires, which biologists say are beneficial to ecosystem health. Standing dead trees, called snags, in an area burned in the Rim Fire in California, July 7, 2016. A scientific debate is intensifying over whether too much money and too many lives are lost fighting forest fires, which biologists say are beneficial to ecosystem health. (Noah Berger/The New York Times) The vision for thinning the forest Brown set an ambitious goal earlier this year to increase mechanical thinning on private lands from about 250,000 acres last year to about 500,000 acres annually within the next five years. He also ordered the first-ever creation of Cal Fire crews dedicated solely to thinning forests. The six 10-person teams will be tasked with using chainsaws and controlled burns to help achieve a goal of treating 60,000 acres a year. At the same time, the U.S. Forest Service has also set a goal of increasing logging and controlled burns, from about 222,500 acres last year to about 500,000 acres a year by 2025. While thinning out all of Californias 8.9 million acres of dead and dying trees using chainsaws is financially and practically speaking impossible, state officials have focused on projects around backcountry communities most at risk. Clearing timber in these areas can reduce fuel loads, but also give firefighters better access when trying to protect homes and other structures using large vehicles. Cal Fire is now doling out $155 million in grants to help start the process near backcountry communities. The money comes on top of $170 million in recently awarded funds to local government agencies and nonprofits for everything from fire-prevention education to cutting down trees to burning the harvested wood in biomass plants to generate electricity. Officials have said that a key part of the equation will be convincing private landowners not currently engaged in timber harvesting to start thinning their property. But the state will have to dramatically boost its logging infrastructure, such as adding new sawmills in the southern Sierras. There has been a downward trend in timber harvesting in California since the 70s and 80s, so you cannot turn that around on a dime, said Helge Eng, deputy director of resource management with Cal Fire. It takes time to attract new sawmills to certain parts of the state and attract the workforce, but I think the grants will help with that. And even with new mills in place, clearing out smaller diameter trees doesnt make landowners a lot of money. Most of the profit is in harvesting larger and more fire-resistant trees, which forestry experts say would only increase the danger of wildfire. Still, the governors plan if not Trumps has won over many ecologists because they believe strongly that the forests could benefit tremendously from removing smaller trees and shrubs, known as understory. Beyond concerns about backcountry blazes, such vegetation can suck up limited moisture making a particular stand more vulnerable to drought. As overgrown forests are exposed to drought and beetle infestations, larger trees die, opening up the canopy for shade-tolerant trees, shrubs and bushes. Beyond the loss of habitat for certain native species, these landscapes are more prone to dry out and fuel the types of wind-driven wildfires that have devastated communities throughout the state in recent years. If we could restore the fuels there to a more appropriate density and structure through thinning and prescribed fire we could make them much more resilient to climate change, said Westerling of UC Merced, but its getting harder and harder to get ahead of that. It requires a lot of resources. Craig Thomas, conservation director for the nonprofit advocacy group Sierra Forest Legacy, also said that he supports cutting down smaller trees in targeted areas, as long as private landowners and federal officials dont turn to logging larger old-growth trees once a sawmill is established. Im hoping that this doesnt devolve into another way to bag some big trees, he said. Weve had enough of that. Getting fire back into the backcountry Another huge selling point for the environmental community: The state and federal governments plans acknowledge the need to ramp up prescribed burns. Reestablishing fire has been the finding of the fire science community of the last 25 years, Thomas said. Californias forests are, somewhat ironically, overstocked because of aggressive fire suppression that started in the early 20th century and continue through today, according to researchers. Timber sales in California, and throughout the west, peaked in the 1980s before efforts to protect several species of spotted owl brought levels down. While logging was dramatically curtailed, the Forest Service and Cal Fire continued battling backcounty blazes with zeal. Ecologists have long criticized the state and federal government for putting out lightning strikes that burn far from homes and communities because such fire clears out brush and smaller trees that live beneath the canopy. Reestablishing fire has been the finding of the fire science community of the last 25 years. — Craig Thomas, conservation director for the nonprofit advocacy group Sierra Forest Legacy Unlike bark beetles that prefer larger trees, fire clears out this understory, while also creating habitat essential to a number of native plant and animal species. While its not as precise as logging and carries the threat of spreading quickly, controlled fires are the most cost-effective way to thin out the forest. While there is overlap in the rhetoric of the Brown and Trump administrations on forest management and wildfire, its unclear for how long the two strategies will converge. Both promised to embrace prescribed fire and limit logging of lucrative old-growth trees. However, forestry experts have said that once efforts are underway, private landowners and timber companies will likely push for less prescribed fire and looser limits on logging.

Mark Kaufman,"In the early 1970s, Dr. Seuss was struggling. Amid the growing environmentalist movement in the United States, punctuated by President Richard Nixon's creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the establishment of the now-beleaguered Endangered Species Act, Dr. Seuss — otherwise known as Theodore Geisel — wanted to write a conservation-themed book for children. But stricken with writer's block, he couldn't. ""He struggled and struggled to do it,"" Nathaniel Dominy, an anthropologist and evolutionary biologist at Dartmouth College, said in an interview. SEE ALSO: Iceland gets away with killing dozens of huge, endangered whales. Here's why. That is, until Dr. Suess made a journey to Kenya. In a new study published Monday in the journal Nature, Dominy and his team make a compelling argument that after Seuss spied the rarely-seen patas monkey in Kenya, his writer's block lifted, and he wrote his famed book, The Lorax. The cover of ""The Lorax."" Image: wikimedia commons The patas monkey ""just looks like a Seuss character,"" said Dominy. ""The resemblance is striking."" The Lorax is mustached character who rails about the destruction of the fictional Truffula trees, as they're chopped down for their silky foliage. It's an environmental disaster, replete with logging, factory pollution, and the trees' depletion. In reality, the Lorax-looking patas monkeys largely depend on a tree — the whistling thorn acacia — common in the Kenyan area Seuss visited. What's more, the Lorax character has a ""signature mustache"" and orange coat — just like the patas monkey. Seuss struggled to write a conservation-themed book in California, where he also happened to be resisting attempts by developers to chop down trees around his San Diego home, Donald Pease, a study coauthor, said in an interview. But when Seuss visited the Mount Kenya Safari Club in 1971, he suddenly became inspired to write The Lorax. ""He wrote 90 precent of it in an afternoon on the back of a laundry list,"" Pease, a famed literary historian said, noting that Seuss likely watched a patas monkey eating the hardened sap from a whistling thorn acacia. (Eating that sap won't harm the tree.) ""The relationship of inimitable dependence disclosed something to Dr. Seuss that created a kind of eureka moment,"" said Pease. ""We think Dr. Seuss created the Lorax, through inspiration, by seeing the patas monkey,"" added Dominy. Africa's whistling thorn acacia. Image: wikimedia commons To further bolster the argument — and test if the Lorax may have simply been modeled after another Seussian cartoon character — the study's authors employed sophisticated facial recognition technology to see if the Lorax identified more with local monkeys in the area Seuss visited, or other Seuss cartoons. ""We found that the Lorax is better characterized by primate face space than even the most similar-looking Seussian character,"" write the authors, specifically referrencing a blue monkey and patas monkey. ""There's something not random about this, from the perspective of the computer,"" said Dominy. ""It really could have a happened,"" Trudy Turner, a primate anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who had no involvement in the study, said in an interview. Turner has seen patas monkeys in Kenya, and said Seuss could very well have seen a patas, or two other closely related species, ultimately inspiring The Lorax. ""The idea is absolutely delightful,"" Turner admitted. A prophetic tale? Almost 50 years after The Lorax was published, the patas monkey ""species as a whole is okay,"" said Dominy, even though they're rarely seen. But in Kenya specifically, the patas monkeys are not okay. Their populations in Kenya have plummeted by half over the last few decades, said Dominy, because the tree they depend, the whistling thorn acacia, is struggling. A rendition of Dr. Seuss' Lorax from the 2012 Universal Pictures film, ""The Lorax."" Image: UNIVERSAL/KOBAL/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK ""This tree has been getting hammered in recent years,"" said Dominy. This area of Africa has experienced a decline in rainfall more severe than any time in the past 1,000 years, tied to human-caused climate change. Animals here, like rhinos and elephants, are forced to graze more on the drought-tolerant trees' leaves, which in turn makes the trees more susceptible to drought. The trees are also chopped down and used to make charcoal. These are obvious environmental struggles in Kenya, perhaps reminiscent of the depletion of the Truffala trees in The Lorax. ""Such findings suggest that we are witnessing a prophetic example of life imitating art imitating life,"" write the authors in the study. And perhaps a quote from The Lorax itself is the best way to explain why all of us should care about the future of the environment: ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.""","In the early 1970s, Dr. Seuss was struggling.

With his shotmaking skills working for him, Pouille has a punchers chance to this thing a step further. Pouille also has a chance to make his first ever grand slam final appearance and his 10th final appearance overall for his career. Pouille has won seven of his last nine matches on hard court.   
Novak Djokovic is coming off a two sets win over Kei Nishikori that took 12 games to decide. In the victory, Djokovic won 85 percent of his first serve points and 89 percent of his second serve points. Djokovic only had to play 49 minutes due to Nishikori retiring early in the second set due to cramps and exhaustion from previous matches. As if Djokovic wasnt the favorite already to win the tournament, he now has the privilege of not having to work much during his quarterfinal match. He didnt need it, but this is a massive advantage for Djokovic with likely two more matches to go. Djokovic hopes to make a grand slam final appearance for the 10th time in his last 16 tries. Djokovic also makes the final of the Australian Open for the seventh time in his career with a victory here. Djokovic has won 10 of his last 11 matches on hard court.     
Theres no previous matches between these two players.
Pouille is a really good player with shotmaking skills and an aggressive offensive game that could give Djokovic some trouble. He came into this tournament struggling, but Pouille is not a pushover by any means and does have five career wins over top-10 players. With that said, picking anybody but Djokovic in this match wouldnt be wise. Djokovic not only has his entire game going for him, but hes as rested as he can be after playing less than an hour in his quarterfinal match. There are training sessions that Djokovic has that last longer than his previous match. The only thing scarier than playing a Djokovic in peak form is playing a rested Djokovic.

"AP, AP","TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) Mark O'Meara seized control with five birdies on the front nine and closed with a 7-under 66 for a four-shot victory Sunday in the Cologuard Classic, his first victory on the PGA Tour Champions in more than eight years.
At 62 years, 1 month, 17 days, he's the fourth-oldest winner in the history of the 50-and-over tour.
O'Meara had a one-shot lead going into the final round and stretched it to four going to the back nine. He was never seriously challenged the rest of the way to pick up his first victory since the Senior Players Championship toward the end of the 2010 season. The Hall of Famer went 8 years, 4 months, 20 days between victories, the second-longest gap on the tour.
O'Meara finished at 17-under 202 on Omni Tucson National's Catalina Course. He matched the tour record with eight straight birdies in an opening 66 and shot 70 in breezy conditions Saturday.
Darren Clarke holed a 50-foot birdie putt on the 18th for a 68 to tie for second with Willie Wood, Kirk Triplett and Scott McCarron, who each had 69. Defending champion Steve Stricker had a 70 to tie for sixth at 11 under.
Former baseball star John Smoltz tied for 53rd at 1 over in his tour debut, closing with a 73. The 51-year-old Hall of Fame pitcher got into the field on a sponsor exemption.
O'Meara has three PGA Tour Champions victories, also winning the 2010 Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf. He won 16 times on the PGA Tour, the last two in 1998 at the Masters and British Open.
Mike Fetchick is the tour's oldest winner at 63 years to the day in the 1985 Hilton Head Seniors. Jay Haas is second at 62 years, 10 months, 7 days in the 2016 Toshiba Classic, and Gary Player third at 62 years, 9 months, 22 days in the 1998 Northville Long Island Classic. Craig Stadler holds the record for longest gap between victories at 8 years, 8 months, 28 days.

Firmino headed in a late third for Liverpool at Vicarage Road, for his first top-flight goal since Sept. 15.

Aria Bendix,"Harvard University has purchased thousands of acres of vineyards in the last six years, but it may not be solely interested in producing wine. The institution is scooping up land with prime access to groundwater, a resource that's become increasingly scarce along California's Central Coast. From 2011 to 2017, California was hit by one of the worst droughts in its history. It was a situation so dire, California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency. Though the emergency was lifted in April 2017, the US Drought Monitor still classifies some California areas as suffering from extreme or severe drought, characterized by water shortages and crop loss. Read more: California's mega-farms have a dark side that could put our supply of fruits, vegetables, and nuts at risk At a time when water resources are limited, land where groundwater is abundant becomes inherently valuable. That pattern is likely to continue as rising global temperatures threaten to exacerbate drought conditions in California and other areas of the American Southwest. The Wall Street Journal reports that investors first approached Harvard about investing in groundwater-rich land in 2012. From there, Harvard gained ownership of a company called Brodiaea, which started to buy up large tracts and plant vineyards. A newly-planted vineyard in Cuyama, California. George Rose/Getty Images The investment money came from the university's $39 billion endowment, which is the largest academic endowment in the world. The Wall Street Journal reports that Harvard's vineyards are now worth $305 million — more than three times what they were worth in 2013. Harvard isn't the only university using its endowment to invest in coveted natural resources. In 2017, Bloomberg reported that both Northwestern University and Rice University had invested in Black Stone Minerals LP, a Houston-based oil and gas company that publicly trades minerals. Oklahoma State University has also acquired the rights to more than 2,000 active wells across 14 states. Because these rights are tied up with the oil, gas, and coal rights on the same land, they've proven incredibly lucrative. But the process of burning coal or drilling for oil can produce harmful emissions that lead to more extreme global temperatures. When those temperatures lead to drought, Harvard's vineyards could become even more precious. Richard Sauret demonstrates the irrigation system at his vineyard in Paso Robles, California. Lucy Nicholson/Reuters Though Harvard has insisted that its investments are ""purely agricultural in nature,"" the university has shown an interest beyond growing and selling grapes. The Wall Street journal reports that Matt Turrentine — the man who approached Harvard about investing in vineyards, and later filed the paperwork to create Brodiaea — hired hydrologists to claim that Harvard's vineyards were separate from areas required to limit their groundwater drilling. Brodiaea has already hired rigs to drill wells on Harvard's property in the Cuyama Valley. In May, environmentalist Kat Taylor, who is married to billionaire Tom Steyer, resigned from Harvard's board of overseers due to ethical concerns about how the university was spending its endowment. Her resignation letter explicitly referenced ""water holdings that threaten the human right to water."" In a statement given to Harvard's newspaper, The Crimson, a university spokesperson addressed Taylor's concerns. ""We agree that climate change is one of world's most urgent and serious issues,"" the spokesperson said, ""but we respectfully disagree on the means by which a university should confront it.""",Harvard University has purchased thousands of acres of California vineyards worth an estimated $305 million.

The song is currently number one on Amazon in the UK and, per Huffington Post, managed to hit the UK's Top 20 as of Monday. The chart-based protest could hit a snag, though, courtesy of England's men's soccer team, which takes the field on Wednesday evening in Russia to play for a spot in the World Cup final. With the team's success, the 1996 soccer anthem ""Three Lions,"" written for the 1996 Euro tournament squad, has moved from ironic cheer to a full-throated anthem and is currently everywhere on UK music charts. To add some emotional heft to the ""Three Lions"" story: English coach Gareth Southgate was a member of that 1996 team and missed a crucial penalty kick that ended England's run in that tournament. Top that redemption story, Green Day. And if England defeats Croatia on Wednesday, reaching Sunday's World Cup final against France, it's very likely to become ensconced at number one no matter what Trump does or says. Of course, given the long, agonizing stretch English fans have experienced since the country's last World Cup win in 1966 (basically international soccer's version of the Chicago Cubs' infamous World Series drought), the ""American Idiot"" pranksters probably won't mind.","You have to hand it to the Brits: they know how to balance giant, floating symbols of protest with more clever forms of channeling anger.

Paul Elias / AP,"(SAN FRANCISCO) — Thousands were forced to flee their homes Monday as major wildfires encroached on a charred area of Northern California still recovering from severe blazes in recent years, sparking concern the state may be in for another destructive series of wildfires this summer. Severe drought has already forced officials in several western states to close national parks as precautions against wildfires and issue warnings throughout the region to prepare for the worst. In California, officials said unusually hot weather, high winds and highly flammable vegetation turned brittle by drought helped fuel the fires that began over the weekend, the same conditions that led to the state’s deadliest and most destructive fire year in 2017. Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday declared a state of emergency in Lake County, where the biggest fire was raging about 120 miles (190 kilometers) north of San Francisco, a rural region particularly hard-hit by fires in recent years. The declaration will enable officials to receive more state resources to fight the fire and for recovery. Jim Steele, an elected supervisor, said the county is impoverished and its fire-fighting equipment antiquated. He also said the county has just a few roads into and out of the region, which can hinder response time. Steele said the area has also been susceptible to fire for many decades because dense brush and trees in the sparsely populated area, but the severity of the latest blazes is unexpected. “What’s happened with the more warming climate is we get low humidity and higher winds and then when we get a fire that’s worse than it’s been in those 50 years,” Steele said. The fire that broke out Saturday evening has forced 3,000 residents from their homes and destroyed at least 22 buildings. It is the latest devastating blaze to rip through the isolated and impoverished county of just 65,000 people in the last few years. In 2015, a series of fires destroyed 2,000 buildings and killed four people. The following year, an arsonist started a fire that wiped out 300 buildings. Last year, the county was among those ravaged by a string of fires that ripped through Northern California wine country. “I think we’re all just so traumatized and overwhelmed with all these fires year after year, this whole community is at a breaking point,” said Terri Gonsalves, 55, who evacuated her home around midnight Sunday. She put four goats into her truck after she looked out her back window and saw a big hill aflame. She is staying with her daughter in nearby Middletown, a small city where dozens of homes were destroyed in 2015. “When this stuff happens, we rally around each other.” Fire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox said more than 230 firefighters were battling the Lake County fire in a rugged area that made it difficult to get equipment close the blaze. A forestry scientist says it’s difficult to forecast how severe California’s wildfires will be this year, but said the drought-dried vegetation throughout the state is a bad omen. “You have a lot of grass and its dry and that’s cause for concern,” said Keith Gilless, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley’s department of environmental science. Authorities on Monday afternoon lifted evacuation orders in Tehama County, where two wildfires were burning. Multiple homes and businesses in the city of Red Bluff were destroyed. A Red Bluff police officer helping residents evacuate lost his home, authorities said. Red Bluff Police Lt. Matt Hansen said people had donated about $10,000 in cash along with furniture and clothing to the family as they search for a rental home. Residents also fled a wildfire in Shasta County. No cause has been determined for any of the fires. Last year, California’s costliest fires killed 44 people and tore through the state’s wine country in October, causing an estimated $10 billion in damage. While the weekend’s blazes were the first major ones of the season to hit California, others have raged throughout the west for weeks. Earlier this month, a Colorado wildfire forced residents of more than 2,000 homes to evacuate. The last evacuees returned home last week. The fire north of Durango was in the Four Corners Region where Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah meet — the epicenter of a large U.S. Southwest swath of exceptional drought, the worst category of drought. Moderate to extreme drought conditions affect those four states plus parts of Nevada, California, Oregon, Oklahoma and Texas, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. __ Associated Press writers Lorin Eleni Gill and Janie Har contributed to this story from San Francisco.","The fire has forced 3,000 residents from their homes and destroyed 22 buildings",2018-06-26T02:02:32Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",California Governor Declares State of Emergency as Wildfires Force Thousands to Flee,http://time.com/5321840/california-wildfires-state-of-emergency/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/ap18176135007776.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,drought,1

(AP Photo/Robert Franklin) (Photo: The Associated Press) SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Arike Ogunbowale overcame a first-half scoreless drought of nearly 17 minutes to finish with 27 points, leading No. 5 Notre Dame past Georgia Tech 85-69 on Sunday. Jackie Young scored 22 points on 10-of-13 shooting, Jessica Shepard had her eighth double-double with 15 points and 11 rebounds and Kathryn Westbeld added 10 points. Coach Muffet McGraw's Irish (23-2, 11-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) won their eighth straight despite 19 turnovers. Kaylan Pugh had 13 points, Francesca Pan 12 and Chanin Scott and Kierra Fletcher scored 10 each for the Yellow Jackets (15-11, 4-9 ACC), who were tied 39-all at halftime. Notre Dame, which led 48-18 at halftime in Atlanta on way to a 77-54 victory over the Yellow Jackets a month ago, started this second half on a 6-0 run. Ogunbowale made two free throws and Shepard and Young had baskets, prompting Georgia Tech coach MaChelle Joseph to call a timeout. Marina Mabrey then stripped Scott of the ball, ran after the turnover and fed a streaking Young for a 51-43 lead with 6:15 left in the third quarter. An 8-0 burst later in the quarter helped the Irish take a 64-54 lead, and they scored 13 straight points in the fourth quarter. BIG PICTURE Georgia Tech: Joseph had used 10 players halfway through the first quarter and employed full-court pressure to tire injury-plagued Notre Dame, which has only seven scholarship players. The strategy worked, forcing an uncharacteristic 15 turnovers by Notre Dame, nine in the second quarter. The Yellow Jackets eventually opened a 39-35 lead on Scott's 3-pointer. Notre Dame: Ogunbowale scored the team's first eight points, then didn't have another point over 16:45 of the first half. McGraw's halftime talk was a short one for Notre Dame, which returned to the court to shoot with more than five minutes remaining, a good four minutes ahead of Georgia Tech.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","California's first measure of snowpack for 2018 is coming up well below levels recorded the same time last year. And there are concerns the drier start this winter could send the state back into drought. AP Frank Gehrke, right, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program, for the Department of Water Resources, checks the snowpack depth as Courtney Obergfell, left, and Michelle Mead, center, both of the National Weather Service, look on during the second snow survey of the season Thursday, Feb. 1, 2018, near Echo Summit, Calif. (Photo: Rich Pedroncelli, AP) The dry times are back. Drought has returned with a vengeance across much of the U.S., with the worst conditions across southern and western parts of the nation. As of Thursday, 38.4% of the continental U.S. is in a drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. That is the highest percentage since the 40% recorded in May 2014. In California, which emerged from a brutal four-year drought last year, 44% of the state is now considered to be in a moderate drought. That's a dramatic jump from just last week, when the figure was 13%. Major winter storms have mostly bypassed the West, meaning that much-needed mountain snow has not fallen, said NOAA meteorologist Richard Heim, author of this week's Drought Monitor. This winter, snow sensors across the Sierra Nevada show the snowpack is just 30% of average for this time of year. The Sierra provides water to millions of Californians. ""It's not nearly where we'd like to be,"" Frank Gehrke, a state official, said after measuring winter snowfall in the Sierra on Thursday. Extremely warm weather is causing most of the precipitation to fall as rain instead of snow. ""This will have major ramifications for western water managers if they don’t get some major winter storms soon,"" Heim said. Whether California heads into another drought cycle will depend largely on how much rain and snow falls during February and March. Further east, the amount of snow on the ground is also far below average across the Colorado River Basin, where a 17-year run of mostly dry years has left reservoirs at alarmingly low levels. ""Mountain snowpack was abysmally low, reaching record low levels for this time of year in parts of New Mexico and Colorado,"" Heim wrote in the monitor this week. Climate scientists and managers of water agencies describe the situation as a “snow drought,” driven in part by winter temperatures that are well above the long-term average. The southern Plains has also been bone-dry, where some spots haven't seen a drop of rain in months. In Amarillo, Texas, for example, no measurable precipitation has fallen for a record 111 days. ""Some areas are having impacts similar to the 2012 drought,"" said Heim, who added that agricultural interests are seeing the worst impacts now. In Oklahoma, pasture conditions were generally poor and deteriorating and 79% of the winter wheat crop was rated in poor to very poor condition, the Drought Monitor said. Looking ahead, drought is expected to either persist or intensify over the next several months, the Climate Prediction Center said. ""The general trend of increasing drought coverage should continue through the end of April, as most areas of drought are expected to persist, along with development forecast in parts of southern California, central Colorado, and the southern Plains,"" the center said. The lack of rain across the southern tier of the nation is typical during a La Niña winter, which is currently in effect. La Niña is a periodic natural cooling of the central Pacific Ocean that affects weather and climate in the U.S. and around the world. Overall, some 87 million Americans are living where there's a drought. That is the highest number since last March, when over 89 million lived in drought conditions. Another ominous sign: There have been over 3,200 wildfires so far this year, which have charred some 71,000 acres, the National Interagency Fire Center said. Both of those numbers are far above average and among the highest in the past decade. As of early February, based on the average of the past 10 years, 1,800 fires would have occurred, scorching 39,000 acres.

Adele Peters,"A stereotypical photo depicting hunger in sub-Saharan Africa might show a gaunt victim. When photographer Chris de Bode traveled to Cameroon–in an area where conflict, drought, and a swelling population of refugees have led to ongoing food shortages–he focused on the food instead. On one plate, with rice, mango leaves, and maize, we see the half-eaten meal of a family that fled from a village on the border with Nigeria when armed men attacked. They now live in a makeshift refugee camp, but there isn’t enough food; after begging, they’ve managed to gather one meal for the day for seven people. This is a bowl of “super cereal.” This milky liquid is an emergency supplementary food for children and adults. It is used as a protein supplement to prevent and address nutritional deficiencies. It is a precooked powder of corn, wheat, and rice fortified with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) and contains milk powder, sugar, and oil. The powder is mixed with water and cooked for 5 to 10 minutes as a porridge. [Photo: Chris de Bode] Another photo shows a bowl of “super cereal,” a milky white porridge used as an emergency supplement. Another plate, with ground maize and a green sauce made from mango leaves, shows the daily meal for a mother and her two youngest children. Her two older children, ages 12 and 15, will have to go to a nearby village to beg for their own food. At a market, de Bode photographed items like a stunted yellow pepper, a battered onion, and a bruised, split tomato–all luxuries, though an onion costs about a penny–and maize husks, which also find their way into many meals, despite their toughness and lack of nutrition. It’s onion season this month in the extreme-north of Cameroon and most stalls in Mémé market have dishevelled red onions to sell. Eating vegetables is a luxury in this part of the world. One onion costs 10 CFA (2¢) from the market. [Photo: Chris de Bode] Cameroon has been at war with Boko Haram since 2014. The northern part of the country, already the poorest region before the conflict began, has been especially hard hit. Boko Haram has kidnapped hundreds of people and forced them to work as farmers for the group; in some places, militants have issued death threats to farmers who don’t want to give up part of their harvest. The group has also stolen at least $6 million worth of livestock. When some farmers have fled from their homes because of attacks, even if they’ve later returned, they’ve often missed crucial timing for planting or tending to their crops. Near the border with Nigeria, the government has forced farmers to cut down tall crops, like maize, because of the risk that enemy soldiers might be hiding in the field. Border closures have also decimated the local economy. To add to the challenges, the region is struggling with drought. Lake Chad–which spanned an area almost the size of Maryland in 1963–has shrunk by 90%, making it harder to irrigate crops. Some brands of fertilizer have been banned because they can also be used in explosives. Traders sometimes can’t deliver food to markets because of violence. And tens of thousands of Nigerians fleeing violence have come to Cameroon, further straining limited food supplies (the government has been criticized for forcibly sending some refugees back ). Earlier this year, the UN reported that only a tiny fraction of the aid money needed in the region had been received. “We call it a silent emergency, where there’s not enough awareness and response and funding to support the needs at the scale that they are,” says Alex Carle, director of programs and partnerships at the British Red Cross. A bag of tanne leaves used to season bland food. These leaves are from a potato plant and can be bought in the local market. It’s a speciality to this region of the extreme-north of Cameroon. When you only eat one meal day, and the options are bland boiled maize, people look for anything to add some flavor to their meal. This bag costs 50 CFA (less than 10¢). [Photo: Chris de Bode] The branches of the Red Cross working in the region provide cash to support some people in the area (giving them the option to spend it on food, when food is available, or on whatever else is needed, like repairing homes damaged in fighting), and work to bring in food when it runs out at markets–though the conflict and treacherous roads make that difficult. The organization reached out to Chris de Bode to create the photo series. “One of the most important decisions I [made] was to kind of stay away from the stereotypical image we have from these hunger-torn areas where people suffer, and make these images which we all know,” says de Bode, who visited Cameroon in 2017 to take the pictures. “I felt by doing the same, which I’ve done a lot over the years, it wouldn’t add anything. Images of someone suffering can be exploitative, he believes. And if they’re commonplace, they’re also easier to ignore. Looking at a plate of food–not unlike the parade of meals depicted on Instagram–makes it easier for someone thousands of miles away to begin to imagine themselves in the same situation.",This photo series looks at the harsh life of refugees through the meager meals they’re forced to scrape together.

"DON J. MELNICK, MARY C. PEARL and MARK A. COCHRANE","What has been particularly worrisome in recent years is that the world’s largest forests, the taiga of Russia and its boreal forest cousins that ring the Arctic and store much of the world’s carbon, experienced wildfires at a rate and scale not seen in at least 10,000 years, according to paleoecological records. The explosive rise in wildfires has occurred for two major, interrelated reasons: climate change and human behavior. As land surface temperatures rise, there has been a general warming across all seasons, with intense periods of heat during the warmest parts of the year, longer intervals without rain and marked reductions in relative humidity. Heat waves and droughts cause vegetation to dry into combustible fuels, enabling small fires to become widespread infernos. Tossing a cigarette butt out a car window or failing to extinguish a campfire can end up obliterating hundreds of thousands of acres within weeks. Research on wildfires in the United States over the past 20 years found that 84 percent were started by people, accounting for 44 percent of the land burned. Moreover, when no controlled burning takes place to eliminate flammable brush and deadwood that has built up on forest floors, those forests become ripe for intense fires that are difficult or impossible to control. As we have seen in the unexpected, catastrophic fires last year in Gatlinburg, Tenn., and this year in Sweden, troubled by record heat and a worsening drought, wildfires are no longer limited to regions typically considered prone to such events. People and communities must recognize and come to grips with serious fire danger conditions and have advance plans for responding to disastrous wildfires. Australia has imposed special construction requirements for fire-prone areas to mitigate wildfire damage, but new, firewise policies for construction and development should exist everywhere wildfires loom as a threat. Climate change has made wildfires collectively one of the most destructive extreme natural events we face, and this trend is likely to worsen in the coming years. Unless we take careful and thoughtful actions, providing education and incentives for adapting to wildfires as well as enforcing stricter rules to prevent them, we risk much more than we realize.",Are we locked in a worldwide pattern of persistent and catastrophic wildfires?,2018-08-08T19:12:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Earth Ablaze,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/opinion/wildfires-california-climate-change.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/07/opinion/08Melnick/merlin_141928866_4065b9eb-dcaa-47a5-b5c7-2755f2cba9f3-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,drought,1

"AP, AP","Levante's Roger Marti, right,scores a penalty during a Spanish La Liga soccer match between Real Madrid and Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid, Spain, Saturday, Oct. 20, 2018. (AP Photo/Paul White) (Photo: The Associated Press) MADRID (AP) Real Madrid reached the worst scoring drought in its history in a 2-1 home loss to Levante in the Spanish league on Saturday. Julen Lopetegui's team went more than 465 minutes without finding the net before Marcelo ended the streak in the second half at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. Madrid hadn't scored in four straight matches, and its winless streak is now at five games. It has lost four of its last five matches, including the last three. Madrid fans jeered the team and Lopetegui, who is under heavy pressure just months after joining the Spanish powerhouse. Levante entered the game with the league's third-worst defense after conceding 14 goals in eight matches. It scored early on Saturday with goals by Jose Luis Morales in the sixth minute and Roger in the 13th. Marcelo pulled one back in the 72nd. Madrid, which began the match without Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema who are coming off injuries, created many chances but was unable to break through the Alaves defense. Madrid struck the woodwork three times and had a goal by Mariano Diaz disallowed for offside in the final minutes. Lopetegui's team had entered the match enduring its worst scoreless streak since 1985. Its slump began with a demoralizing 3-0 loss at Sevilla, then it was held by Atletico Madrid to a 0-0 draw at home in the city derby, lost 1-0 at CSKA Moscow in the Champions League and was beaten 1-0 at Alaves to drop to fifth in the league standings. ___ More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports ___ Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Levante won the match 2-1. (AP Photo/Paul White) (Photo: The Associated Press) MADRID (AP) After seeing their team suffer its worst scoring drought and lose for the fourth time in five matches, Real Madrid fans ran out of patience. They loudly jeered coach Julen Lopetegui and his players after Madrid reached 481 minutes without finding the net in losing to Levante 2-1 at home in the Spanish league on Saturday. Lopetegui, only three months into his stint with Real Madrid, defended himself against the critics. ""Football matches are won by scoring goals and not according to who deserves to win,"" he said. ""We did what we needed to do because we had 34 or 35 shots on goals, 14 or 15 of which were on target. We had goals ruled out, hit the woodwork three times.... We attacked a lot and looked dangerous. The stats aren't worth much at all, what counts are the goals. This is the way things go in football."" Local media immediately questioned whether Madrid should fire Lopetegui before next weekend's clasico at Barcelona or give him a chance to try to save his job against the rival. Lopetegui insisted he wasn't too concerned. ""I'm more motivated than ever,"" he said. ""I worry about quickly picking up the boys and keep believing, because it's the only way to change this run."" Before the clasico, Madrid hosts Viktoria Plzen on Tuesday in the Champions League to try to rebound from a 1-0 loss at CSKA Moscow. The European champion could drop further in La Liga by the end of the weekend. Madrid is three points behind surprising leader Alaves. The winner of the Barcelona-Sevilla game later Saturday will move to the top of the standings. Atletico Madrid, two points behind Sevilla, visits struggling Villarreal also on Saturday. ANOTHER DRAW Valencia couldn't manage more than 1-1 against struggling Leganes at home, being held winless for the fifth time in six matches. Valencia has only one win this season, 1-0 at Real Sociedad two rounds ago.

TYLER KEPNER,"Yelich, who had never played for a winning team with Miami, was thrilled to be on board. The Brewers have the longest playoff drought in the N.L. Central (they last reached the postseason in 2011), but were coming off a second-place finish. They have drawn more than 2.5 million fans to Miller Park this season for the 11th time in 12 years, despite playing in the majors smallest market. I thought the one thing he would notice about our park, in deference to Miami, is theres people there, for one thing, Uecker said. I mean, really, people are screaming and hollering at Christian Yelich when he runs on the field, before he even comes to bat. And its not only because of what hes done here late in the season. Once he got into the lineup and people started watching him on a daily basis, it was just the way he operates. Nothing revolves around him. Its always the team. That motivation has made the recent attention somewhat awkward, Yelich said, but the pennant race has crystallized the more important goal of winning. Teammates and coaches are happy to rave about him, anyway. Darnell Coles, the hitting coach, praised Yelichs sophisticated understanding of his own swing, a skill he also recognized in tacticians like Tony Gwynn, Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez. Infielder Travis Shaw called Yelichs swing easily repeatable, because of its simplicity and his ability to quickly correct flaws. As a boy, Yelich loved the Dodgers and their smooth left-handed slugger, Shawn Green; he remembers how Green would toss his batting gloves into the crowd after home runs. Yelichs own sweet swing was self-taught, he said, never molded by a private hitting coach. Its just how Ive always swung a baseball bat, Yelich said. I was the first person in my family to play baseball. No one was like, Heres how you swing. It was just like, Lets go hit and figure it out along the way. I always kind of figured it out. Yelich, in other words, is not a product of the launch-angle craze in which players tailor their swings to hit fly balls. Through Monday, according to Fangraphs, only 23 percent of his batted balls had been fly balls, ranking 137th out of 144 qualified hitters. Yet Yelichs ratio of homers to fly balls ranked first, with nearly 33 percent of his fly balls leaving the park.","Robin Yount, Ryan Braun, and maybe soon another Brewers Most Valuable Player",2018-09-26T14:23:00Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Christian Yelich Has the Brewers Soaring and Makes a Case for M.V.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/sports/milwaukee-brewers-christian-yelich.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/sports/yelich-topper/yelich-topper-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,drought,1
