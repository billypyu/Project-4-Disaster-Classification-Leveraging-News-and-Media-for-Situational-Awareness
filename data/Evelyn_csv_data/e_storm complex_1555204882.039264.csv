George Dvorsky,"During its 15th flyby of Jupiter, NASA’s Juno spacecraft captured a rare image of a Jovian “brown barge.” It’s not nearly as impressive or picturesque as the Great Red Spot, but this big brown splotch is yet another reminder of many complex atmospheric processes happening on our Solar System’s largest planet. Also known as brown ovals, brown barges are large cyclonic regions that typically form in Jupiter’s dark North Equatorial Belt or, less frequently, in the dark South Equatorial Belt, according to NASA. This particular storm is located in the southern belt. Juno, which has been orbiting Jupiter since July 2016, took this picture on September 6, 2018 at a distance of 7,425 miles (11,950 km) from the planet’s cloud tops. The color-enhanced image was created by citizen scientist Kevin M. Gill, who used data from the spacecraft’s JunoCam, which is accessible to the public. NASA says it’s the first close-up view of this atmospheric phenomenon, providing an unprecedented glimpse of the detailed structures within the storm. Brown ovals are typically hard to see, but this time we got lucky. As NASA describes in a press release, “They can often be difficult to detect visually because their color blends in with the dark surroundings. At other times, as with this image, the dark belt material recedes, creating a lighter-colored background against which the brown barge is more conspicuous.” This atmospheric feature is reminiscent of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot—an anticyclonic storm that’s been continuously observed by astronomers for the past 350 years. Unlike the persistent Great Red Spot, however, brown barges don’t last very long. This storm will eventually run its course, dissipate, and likely go through a new cycle of reorganization. Most features within Jupiter’s belts and zones are short-lived, lasting anywhere from three to 15 years. Juno has now completed 15 flybys of the gas giant. Its next close encounter will happen on October 29, 2018. The good news is that Juno is still less than halfway through its mission; the spacecraft is scheduled to make another 20 flybys, the final one occurring on July 30, 2021. Hopefully there will be plenty more brown splotches and other exotic phenomenon in the months and years to come.

You should know your states most pressing environmental issues before you head to the polls, and Popular Science has a guid e to help you brush up. The guide is technically on science policy issues, but almost all of them relate to ways that legislation (or lack of it) can affect the air you breathe, the water you drink, and the ground you stand on. A few highlights: Environmental issues are some of the trickiest ones in politics, because legislators and officials are trying to juggle environmental issues with other concerns, and there tend to be tradeoffs. For example, the two voters guides we linked for California disagree on a water-related proposition: it would restore wetlands, but it would also take money away from the effort to reduce carbon emissions (to name just a few considerations in what is, itself, a complex proposal).

MIRIAM JORDAN and ILANA PANICH-LINSMAN,"TIJUANA, Mexico The skies opened before the border did. A downpour, a blessing for this rain-starved region of Mexico, was a curse for thousands of migrants parked in a squalid encampment. Having started lightly overnight, the storm unleashed its full fury Thursday morning, quickly flooding the open-air sports complex near downtown Tijuana where most members of a migrant caravan from Central America have been parked since they started arriving two weeks ago. Within hours, nothing was left on the spit of dirt many had claimed and inhabited in a tent, or a lean-to fashioned from plastic, blankets and tarp except fetid muck. The little they had was reduced to piles of soggy blankets, backpacks and stuffed animals they struggled to protect under plastic sheets. Up to an inch of rain pounded Tijuana every hour, according to local meteorologists. Some families sought refuge under a large, overcrowded, open-sided tent. Madeline Julissa, 8, stood clutching a baby doll whose body was drier, and better covered, than her own; the girl wore a summer top and damp pants pushed up to mid-thigh. Her family of three, including her mother and baby sister, had lost their shelter, fashioned from plastic and tarp, to the heavy rainfall.","A downpour quickly flooded the open-air complex sheltering arrivals from Central America, reducing their few belongings to a soggy mess.",2018-11-30T17:44:59Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Rains Turn Squalid Migrant Camp Near California Border Into Scene of Fetid Misery,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/us/migrant-camp-tijuana.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/30/us/01migrants9/merlin_147511233_a7fc710d-95a5-4d69-93ed-d90c40c659d1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,storm complex,1
JOHN SCHWARTZ,"Photo Braving the elements in West Stockbridge, Mass., last week. The Northeast found itself dealing with another winter storm on Wednesday. Credit Ben Garver/The Berkshire Eagle, via Associated Press John Schwartz, a New York Times reporter who covers climate change and the environment, is answering reader questions about the winter storm in the Northeast United States, the second to hit the region in less than a week. Ask your questions by emailing storms@nytimes.com. If it’s cold, how can there be climate change? That’s a common question — one asked, in various ways, by the president of the United States. But it’s based on a fallacy. Weather is not climate. Weather refers to day-to-day conditions; climate is about long-term trends. And the long-term trends show a planet that is warming, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Even with occasional Arctic blasts of bitter cold, which we’ve seen in much of the United States in recent years, 2017 had the second-highest surface temperatures ever recorded, surpassed only by 2016 — which was the third “hottest year” in a row. The trends are clear, even if you can make a snowball in March in Central Park. Really, though — is there some connection between climate change and this cold weather? Scientists have been looking at phenomena like cold spells, which occur when air from the Arctic dips south. After all, the Arctic is warming as a result of climate change, and that appears to be weakening the jet stream, which tends to hold that cold air up toward the top of the world. As Marlene Kretschmer, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told The Times in January, the connection is not yet fully established. “There’s a lot of agreement that the Arctic plays a role, it’s just not known exactly how much,” she said. “It’s a very complex system.” The weather report shows temperatures in the mid-30s or higher in some regions. How can it snow if the temperature is above freezing? The temperature near the ground is above freezing, but up in the clouds, where the snow forms, it’s well below freezing. Falling through the warmer air, however, can have an effect on the snowflakes, which may partially melt and clump together on the way down. Newscasters keep calling this storm “Quinn.” Is naming winter storms new? Relatively speaking, yes. The Weather Channel began naming storms in 2012. Not everyone approves, including my colleague Henry Fountain, who had this to say in January about the winter storm that was given the unfortunate name “Grayson.” My regular tweet to ignore the Weather Channel's name for this storm. It serves no useful purpose and is simply a marketing ploy. Plus this particular name is especially god-awful. — Henry Fountain (@henryfountain) Jan. 4, 2018 What’s the deal with buying toilet paper and milk? Good Seinfeld impression! The question is why do people slam the grocery stores before a storm for supplies like toilet paper and milk? At least if you get eggs, too, you can make French toast. But how much milk do you expect to drink? ( About 65 percent of people become lactose intolerant after infancy anyway — which, come to think of it, might explain the toilet paper.) Seriously, though, you’d be better off preparing for storms by stocking up on good, bright LED flashlights and spare chargers for your cellphone in case the power goes out.

SHERI FINK,"Dr. Perez Pantoja has made house calls upstairs, especially when the generators were down. He has seen a lot of depression and anxiety. Night comes with a chorus of frog song. On a recent evening, the woman with dementia wandered the halls and cried. Ms. Olivera, the administrator, hugged her. In the recreation room, a man with lung cancer and diabetes, Aurelio Hernandez Perez, 76, gave himself a breathing treatment, knowing the generators would soon be switched off. Another man walked by, his arm in a cast. He said he had fallen in the dark and then waited days in pain before getting an X-ray. A man in a yellow shirt returned from visiting his wife in the hospital, where she was being treated for pneumonia, another disease that has claimed more lives after the storm this year than in the same months in previous years. Jose Santiago Tanco, 63, a diabetic, slid into a cot in the hallway as he did each night, fearful of sleeping alone upstairs. “How am I going to ask for help?” he said. Ms. Rodriguez de Jesus often spends evenings visiting her son and daughter-in-law, who live across the courtyard. Her home telephone stopped working after the power failed, and she did not have a cellphone. So when she left them at night, she knew they would stare out their windows until she arrived home and waved a small lantern like a pendulum from her dark apartment to let them know. Then she closed the shutters and went to sleep. When power returned to part of the Hill Brothers area last week, the company that administers Comunidad del Retiro finally had the chance to get service restored to the complex. It had to pay a private electrician to do the work. During the dark months, two of the complex’s most fragile residents had died; it was not clear, Ms. Olivera said, what role the loss of power might have played in hastening their deaths.

Devin Coldewey,"Some people, when they look up at the sky and see a cloud, think “dog” or “fluffy.” And some people think “it’s a waning cumulus with a feathered edge suggesting a pressure system from the north ending in an updraft, which would probably cause turbulence. Also looks a bit like a dog.” Clearly one of those people created these complex, beautiful renderings of weather data. The idea behind this project at ETH Zurich, led by Markus Gross, is that different visualizations of detailed weather data may be highly useful in different fields. He and his colleagues have been working on a huge set of such data and finding ways of accurately representing it with an eye to empowering meteorologists from the TV station to the research lab. “The scientific value of our visualisation lies in the fact that we make something visible that was impossible to see with the existing tools,” explained undergraduate researcher Noël Rimensberger in an ETHZ news release. Representing weather “in a relatively simple, comprehensible way” is its own reward, really. The data in question are all from the evening of April 26, 2013, the date chosen for a large-scale meteorology project in which multiple institutions collaborated. The team created different ways to visualize different bodies of data. For instance, if you were looking down on a whole county, what’s the use of seeing every little ripple of a cloud system? What you need is larger trends and ways of picking out important data points, such as areas likely to develop precipitation, or where the beginnings of movement suggest a cold front moving in. [gallery ids=""1627090,1627089,1627088,1627093,1627087""] On the other hand, such macro data has no place when you’re looking at the formation of clouds over a single locality, or why a storm seems to have struck with unnatural fierceness there. And again, what if you’re a small aircraft pilot? A little rain and clouds you might not mind, but what if you want to see patterns of turbulence in the country and how they move as the day wears on? Or if you’re investigating what led to a crash at a particular location and time? These visualizations show how a large set data can be interpreted and displayed in many ways and to many purposes. Tobias Günther, Rimensberger’s supervisor on the project, pointed out that the algorithms they used to interpret the reams of data and create these simulations are far too slow at present, but they’re working on improving them. Still, some could be used if time isn’t of the essence.

Devin Coldewey,"There’s a lot about snow we don’t know. Where does it come from? Where does it go? What does it taste like? Admittedly there are tentative answers to these questions. But there are yet more complex ones like how exactly, on a microscopic level, snow melts in mid-air. That’s the focus of one project at NASA, the results of which are both practical and beautiful. Snow is a critical part of the weather system (did you know there’s a whole “cryosphere””), and the ways in which it forms and melts can help meteorologists predict, for example, the likelihood or severity of a storm. But it’s not enough to catch a flake in your hand and look closely. Like anything else, you need a mathematical model of a phenomenon in order to understand it properly. Jussi Leinonen has been working on this problem for years at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “I got interested in modeling melting snow because of the way it affects our observations with remote sensing instruments,” he said in a news release. As you can imagine, it’s rather important for a rocket science lab to be able to understand and predict weather patterns. Leinonen’s contribution has been an exact model of how and why snowflakes melt — which types of flakes, at what temperatures, in what ways, and so on. The basic version is this: water collects in concave regions of snowflakes where it can stay liquid. Those little lakes expand, eventually covering the whole ice crystal and encasing the core, which also eventually melts. Sounds straightforward, but Leinonen’s model shows how this happens at an extremely detailed level with arbitrarily shaped snowflakes and clumps thereof. The 3D visualization of this process is remarkably beautiful, and more importantly seems to be correct. With an accurate model meteorologists can profile different snow and rain types, see how they perform in various conditions, and produce relevant details like how those differences would affect a radar image. No word on when we can get a screensaver of snowflakes melting with high precision. Leinonen published his research in the journal Geophysical Research.","There's a lot about snow we don't know.

Andrew Freedman,"The weather in the Plains states has been anything but normal lately. Oklahoma — a state synonymous with tornadoes — didn't have a single twisters through April 30, a new record. Instead, states from Texas north to Nebraska have been dealing with dust storms and sprawling, fast-moving grass fires as unusually dry weather has taken its toll on the region. That tornado and precipitation drought changes on Tuesday, as a complex series of storm systems unleashes several rounds of severe thunderstorms across the region. SEE ALSO: Epic deluge in Hawaii may have broken all-time U.S. rainfall record, with 4 feet in 24 hours The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) — the arm of the National Weather Service responsible for issuing severe thunderstorm outlooks — issued a ""moderate risk"" outlook for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday. In the outlook, the SPC highlighted a small area of Kansas at greatest risk of storms that could bring large hail, damaging winds, and a few potentially strong tornadoes. Plot of annual tornado count, adjusted to remove overcounting from multiple sightings of the same tornado. 2018 is in black. Image: noaa spc. ""Tornadoes, a couple of which could be strong, very large hail, and damaging winds will be possible,"" the SPC stated on its website. Severe thunderstorms are also expected to flare up in Nebraska and Iowa on Tuesday afternoon and evening. Other areas, outside of Kansas, are also at risk for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday, even if forecaster confidence is lower. These places include Texas and Oklahoma, northward into Iowa. One limiting factor for storms, and a forecasting wild card, is the recent dryness that has contributed to the dire fire weather conditions in the past several weeks. Fires singed more than 350,000 acres in Oklahoma, killing more than 1,000 cattle. Fires are still burning in Oklahoma and Kansas today, at the same time the atmosphere is threatening to unleash a totally different type of hazard. While moisture from the Gulf of Mexico has flowed northward into the heart of what is commonly referred to as ""Tornado Alley,"" the dryness of soils in these states could act to inhibit the formation of severe storms. The threat of severe weather will ramp up on Wednesday and linger into Thursday as a series of storms dives into the Southwest, and moves across the Plains and Midwest. By Friday, it's quite possible that Oklahoma will have recorded its first tornado of the season. While tornado season usually peaks during the next few weeks, the same weather pattern responsible for the extraordinarily chilly April across much of the U.S. helped put a lid on severe storm activity up until now. Mother Nature has a lot of catching up to do if the season is going to turn out to be close to average.","The weather in the Plains states has been anything but normal lately.

Mark Kaufman,"There's no doubt that hurricanes are complicated beasts with complex origins. But following the Atlantic's extremely active 2017 hurricane season, a group of scientists at Princeton University's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory have identified a connection between the six major hurricanes with winds over 110 mph that churned in the ocean, three of which pummeled the U.S. All were supercharged by unusually warm waters, and these warm conditions outweighed other weather factors. This research published on Thursday in the journal Science has significant climate change implications, as the world is expected to continue its accelerating warming trend. Hurricane Irma on Sept. 8, 2017. Image: nasa Critically, over 90 percent of the accumulating heat on Earth is absorbed by the planet's oceans. ""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" NASA oceanographer Josh Willis said. Hurricanes feed off warm waters. It's their fuel. But still, warm waters alone don't stoke hurricanes. SEE ALSO: How flocks of birds got trapped inside the eye of Hurricane Florence To pinpoint the factors that drove the 2017 hurricane season, the Princeton scientists used a sophisticated climate computing model to simulate the different wide-scale weather conditions on Earth. This is no easy task. Any hurricane season has a number of influences that may propel, or dampen, the storm season or any particular storm. ""It's quite complicated, theres many moving parts,"" Colin Zarzycki, a storm scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research who had no role in the study, said in an interview. ""It's not just ocean temperature. It's kind of a big tangled web."" Hurricane Harvey as seen from the International Space Station in August 2017. Image: nasa But even so, after simulating different weather conditions, it became clear that other major climate factors like cooling in the Pacific waters were overpowered by the effects of the unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic. The increase in 2017 hurricanes was caused ""mainly by pronounced warm sea surface conditions in the tropical North Atlantic,"" the researchers wrote. But there was another critical factor driving these storms. ""The key point is that the Atlantic was warmer than other open oceans all over the world,"" the study's lead author, Hiroyuki Murakami, said in an interview. This caused more warm air to rise up into the sky over the Atlantic, making the atmosphere more unstable and ripe for tumultuous storm activity. In short, the Atlantic ocean got an ""extra kick"" from all this rising motion, Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane scientist at Florida International University, said over email. ""As a result, thunderstorms that feed hurricanes become stronger,"" said Willoughby. Hurricanes Maria and Jose in September 2017. Image: nasa The power of warm waters The Atlantic wasn't just warm it was much warmer than Earth's other oceans. But regardless, just having unusually warm waters in the Atlantic is still going to fuel powerful storms. ""When you get an ocean basin that gets warm like that, it really primes the atmosphere to be conducive to these strong storms,"" said Zarzycki. ""When you boil it down, with warmer atmosphere and sea surface temperatures, under ideal conditions we would expect storms to be stronger."" That said, Zarzycki underscores that other weather factors like strong wind shear that pummels and weakens hurricanes can weaken or tear apart any storm. But without these weakening factors, hurricanes can really ignite as they did in 2017. Going forward, what might this all mean for the future storm activity? Should we expect more major hurricanes? In future decades, perhaps by 2080, warming oceans may boost the count of major storms in the Atlantic during a busy season from six to eight, said Murakami. This means more opportunities for giant storms to hit the U.S. coast. But in the next 10 years, he can't say if warmer oceans might generate more major hurricanes. Weather patterns, or natural variability, are just too unpredictable. Hurricane Maria passing over Puerto Rico. Image: nasa ""It remains uncertain as to whether we will see more frequent active hurricane seasons like 2017 in the upcoming decade due to the dominant influence of natural variability,"" Murakami said. For example, there's a major climate trend running on 30-year timescales called the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation, that can warm or cool vast swaths of the Atlantic, said Willoughby. Saharan dust from Africa also blows over the ocean, which can cool the waters, he said. And there are major influences from the Pacific Ocean that can drive down wind shear in the Atlantic. ""All of these well-established oceanic vacillations make it harder to define the long-term warming caused by us humans,"" said Willoughby. So, it's complicated. But one thing is much more certain: Warm oceans fueled the Atlantic's extremely active 2017 season. And overall, we can expect more warm water.","There's no doubt that hurricanes are complicated beasts with complex origins.

They had something in common, of course, but Dropbox has always been about purely about managing files in the cloud, while Box has been focused on enterprise content use case cases in the cloud — and that’s a very different approach. As Shria Ovide pointed out in her analysis on Bloomberg after the filing, the S-1 also proved that Dropbox has always been a “ a consumer software company with a side hustle.” That side hustle was the enterprise business. (She also pointed out on Twitter that they may be the first company to use a cupcake emoji in their S-1, which is actually kind of cool). Consumer with a dash of enterprise It turns out that vast majority of Dropbox’s revenue came from consumers. It added up to over $1 billion in combined business and consumer revenue, which isn’t too shabby, but it’s still a completely different approach. Dropbox has always offered an attractive consumer storage tool. It’s well integrated into desktop OSs and it has a nice mobile tool. I use it and for $10 a month I get a terabyte of storage. I can back up my life there and it incorporates neatly into Finder on my Mac. When I capture screens they go automatically to Dropbox. It provides a place to backup my photos from my phone. It’s convenient and easy and it works. It seemed that such a tool would translate nicely to business, but Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis, who has been following this space for years, says Dropbox has always primarily been confined to teams on the business side. “Dropbox is primarily a consumer company with 500 million users, [with] only about 300,000 teams using their business offering,” he told TechCrunch. That’s not to say they aren’t trying to capture more of the enterprise. In the weeks prior to the IPO, they made a pair of announcements designed to increase their enterprise credibility including one with Google to store G Suite documents natively in Dropbox and one with Salesforce to embed Dropbox folders in Salesforce Sales and Marketing clouds. For now though, even with this business push, Pelz-Sharpe points out that most of Dropbox’s business customers are small teams of 3 or more people with a dash of larger implementations. “Nor are people building much on top of Dropbox in the way of business applications – it remains primarily a very efficient file sharing system,” he explained. Differences with Box This in contrast to Box, which has been working primarily with large enterprise companies for years to solve much more complex problems around content. Aaron Levie from Box said he’s absolutely rooting for Dropbox, but they have always been going after different markets, since Box decide to go enterprise about two years into its existence. “We are fundamentally building two very different companies. Both are large markets. While there is no limit to the scale they could become, we have built a very different business around how do you serve [large companies] and deal with unstructured company data — and it’s a very different product set [from Dropbox],” Levie told TechCrunch. Dropbox was off to a great start today with stock soaring, up nearly 40 percent in early trading, but however Dropbox ends up doing in the days and months ahead, they will do it having made their mark mostly as a consumer company — and that’s fine. If they continue to build their enterprise business over time, it will be all the better for them, but it turns out up until now, the only thing Box and Dropbox had in common was both had “box” in their names.","As Dropbox had its IPO moment this morning, more than 10 years after launching, we can finally put one myth to rest.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images A violent storm on the Sun could cripple communications on Earth and cause huge economic damage, scientists have warned. Why are solar storms such a threat? In 1972, dozens of sea mines off the coast of Vietnam mysteriously exploded. It was recently confirmed the cause was solar storms, which can significantly disrupt the Earth's magnetic field. Today, the effects of a similar event could be much more serious - disrupting the technology we rely on for everything from satellites to power grids. The cost to the UK economy alone of an unexpected event has been estimated at £16bn. There are good reasons why we are vulnerable to events taking place millions of miles from Earth. What causes an extreme solar event? The Sun is a star, a seething mass of electrified hydrogen. As this fluid moves around, it builds up energy within its complex magnetic field. This magnetic energy is released through intense flashes of light known as solar flares and through vast eruptions of material and magnetic fields known as coronal mass ejections or solar storms. While flares can disrupt radio communication on Earth, solar storms pose the greatest threat. Each storm contains the energy equivalent to 100,000 times the world's entire nuclear arsenal, although this is spread throughout an enormous volume in space. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The northern lights over Finland The Sun rotates like a vast spinning firework, launching eruptions into space in all directions. If one of these heads towards our planet, with a magnetic field aligned opposite to the Earth's, the two fields can merge together. As the solar storm washes past, some of the Earth's magnetic field is distorted into a long tail. And when this distorted magnetic field eventually snaps back, it accelerates electrified particles towards the Earth. Here, they strike the upper atmosphere, heating it and causing it to glow in a spectacular display known as the northern and southern lights. But this distortion of the Earth's magnetic field has other, more significant effects. It is thought to have triggered the sea mines back in 1972. The mines were designed to detect small variations in the magnetic field caused by the approach of metal-hulled boats. But their engineers hadn't anticipated that solar activity could have the same effect. When will the next extreme weather event happen? Scientists are looking for clues as to what triggers these vast eruptions and, once they have been launched, how to track them through interplanetary space. Our records of the Earth's magnetic field go back as far as the mid-19th Century. They suggest an extreme space weather event is likely to occur once every 100 years, although smaller events will happen more frequently. In 1859, the Carrington Event - most extreme solar storm recorded to date - caused telegraph systems to spark and for the northern lights to be spotted as far south as the Bahamas. The next time it happens, the effects are likely to be far more serious. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Observers at the launch of a satellite With every solar cycle, our global community has become more reliant on technology. In 2018, space satellites are central to global communication and navigation, while aeroplanes connect continents and extensive power grids crisscross the world. All of these could be badly affected by the aftermath of extreme solar events. Electronic systems on spacecraft and aeroplanes could be harmed as their miniaturised electronics are zapped by energetic particles accelerated into our atmosphere, while power networks on the ground can be overwhelmed by excess electrical currents. More like this Planning ahead Enough satellites and power grids have failed during past space weather events to make it clear that the Sun must be closely monitored, to help predict when a solar storm will affect Earth. Forecasters are working on this all over the world, from the UK's Met Office to the Australian Met Bureau and the Noaa Space Weather Prediction Center in the US. All being well, they can detect when a storm is heading towards Earth and predict its arrival time within six hours. That still leaves relatively little time to prepare but forecasting would cut the cost to the UK economy from £16bn to £3bn. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Mauna Kea Observatory summit, in Hawaii Space weather now appears on the UK government's risk register, alongside other, more familiar risks such as a flu pandemic and severe flooding. It has been rated at the equivalent risk as a severe heatwave or the emergence of a new infectious disease. Government agencies are now speaking to power companies, spacecraft and airline operators to ensure they have plans in place to limit the impact of an extreme space weather event. It is vital, for example, to make sure enough power is available to refrigerate supplies of food and medicine as well as to make sure water and fuel can be pumped as needed. If communication with some satellites is lost, familiar technologies such as sat-navs and satellite television could stop working. Spacecraft engineers study extreme events so they can build resilience into spacecraft, protecting vulnerable electronics and installing backup systems. Image copyright Getty Images An accurate space weather forecast would enable operators to further protect their assets by ensuring they were in a safe state as the storm passed. Many planes fly over the north pole en route from Europe to North America. During space weather events, aircraft operators re-route aeroplanes away from the polar skies, where most of the energetic particles enter Earth's atmosphere. This is to limit exposure to enhanced radiation doses and ensure reliable radio communication. We have learned much about space weather since the events of 1972 but as modern technologies evolve, we need to make sure they can withstand the worst the Sun can throw at us.

GLENN THRUSH,"Traditionally states, and not the federal government, have been responsible for hashing out the details of assessing damage, processing claims and distributing funding in the wake of national disasters, a system intended to give local decision makers control over how their communities are rebuilt. But states and cities, unaccustomed to dealing with the complex logistical and oversight issues of administering programs geared at fast-tracking billions in capital projects, are now finding themselves overwhelmed by the demands, even though such challenges have been well-documented since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Many of the areas most prone to repeated hurricanes, especially Louisiana, Texas, Puerto Rico, and now North Carolina, have all experienced similar problems as they adjust to a new normal in which disaster agencies are permanently mobilized and f ederal disaster money is now one of the single biggest sources of government money used to help rehabilitate or preserve low-income housing. We are really good at disaster recovery programs, hazard mitigation, helping individual people who are in trouble, but not at this kind of thing, said the states emergency management director, Michael A. Sprayberry, who contends that the lessons learned under Matthew will help the state more efficiently distribute post-Florence disaster funding. We have had to hire and stand up a completely new staff roughly 50, 60 new people so this is a whole new ballgame. It took more than 10 months to comply with federally mandated environmental reviews and other red tape, Mr. Sprayberry said, which is contributing to the frustration. There will be a news release from HUD saying that the state is going to be receiving funding, which right then sort of automatically raises the level of expectations, he added.",North Carolina has had an especially hard time distributing money earmarked by Congress to help low- and moderate-income homeowners in the wake of disasters.,2018-09-24T23:32:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","North Carolina, a ‘Slow Spender’ State, Struggles to Hand Out Storm Aid",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/us/north-carolina-florence-matthew-disaster-aid.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/us/00nchousing-02/00nchousing-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,storm complex,1
George Obulutsa,"Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, Kenya, Jan. 15, 2019.
THOMAS MUKOYA/Reuters
Gunmen blasted their way into a hotel and office complex in the Kenyan capital on Tuesday, sending workers fleeing for their lives as others cowered under their desks from an attack claimed by Somali Islamists al Shabaab.
At least one person was killed and eight wounded, hospital officials said. Police warned the terror attack may still be ongoing, with the assailants still inside the upscale 14 Riverside Drive complex.
The main door of the hotel was blown open and there was a human arm in the street severed from the shoulder, said Serge Medic, the Swiss owner of a security company who ran to the scene to help civilians when he heard of the attack from his taxi driver.

Medic, who was armed, entered the building with a policeman and two soldiers, he said, but they came under fire and retreated. An unexploded grenade lay in the lobby, he said.
One man said he saw two armed men with scarves on their head and bandoliers of bullets, Medic told Reuters, as gunfire echoed in the background, more than two hours after the attack began.
A woman shot in the leg was carried out and three men emerged covered in blood. Some office workers climbed out of windows. Many told Reuters that they had had to leave colleagues behind, still huddled under their desks.
Theres a grenade in the bathroom, one officer yelled as police rushed out from one building.
We heard a loud bang from something that was thrown inside. Then I saw shattered glass, Geoffrey Otieno, who works at a beauty salon in the complex, told Reuters. We hid until we were rescued.
Kenya has often been targeted by al Shabaab, who killed dozens of people in a shopping center in 2013 and nearly 150 students at a university in 2015.
We are behind the attack in Nairobi. The operation is going on, said Abdiasis Abu Musab, the groups military operations spokesman.

According to its website, 14 Riverside is home to the local offices of international companies including BASF, Colgate Palmolive, Reckitt Benckiser, Pernod Ricard, Dow Chemical and SAP, as well as the dusitD2 hotel, part of the Thai hotel group Dusit Thani.
The Australia embassy is across the road from the compound. Kenya is an expatriate hub for diplomats, aid workers, businessmen and others operating around east Africa.
I just started hearing gunshots, and then started seeing people running away raising their hands up and some were entering the bank to hide for their lives, a woman working in a bank in the complex said, adding she had heard two explosions.
Kenyan television featured appeals for blood from local hospitals and showed police cordoning off the route to ensure vehicles could move quickly. Red Cross ambulances ferried victims away.
Al Shabaab says its attacks in Kenya are revenge for Kenyan troops stationed inside Somalia which has been riven by civil war since 1991.
The Kenyan troops, concentrated in the south, originally went into Somalia to try to create a buffer zone along the border. They are now part of an African Union peacekeeping force supporting the weak U.N.-backed central government.","Gunmen storm Nairobi hotel compound in deadly attack claimed by al-Shabab The Globe and Mail Extremists attack hotel in Nairobi; al-Shabab claims role CTV News Kenya hotel complex under attack, al-Shabaab claims responsibility CBC.ca Gunfire, explosions erupt…",2019-01-15T13:31:43Z,"{'id': 'the-globe-and-mail', 'name': 'The Globe And Mail'}",Gunmen storm Nairobi hotel compound in deadly attack claimed by al-Shabab - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-gunshots-heard-at-hotel-office-complex-in-kenyan-capital/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/JM317SyckmZ0E3Q9Lw2xe9LfO3c=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKCWHTUIU5GCPFP33NWVQIUDBE.JPG,the-globe-and-mail,The Globe And Mail,storm complex,1
PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Though Puerto Rico is home to 3.4 million United States citizens, the tax code treats the island as both a foreign and domestic entity. American affiliates in Puerto Rico get tax breaks like the ones granted to foreign companies, while the goods they produce are sold as made in America. The tax on intellectual property, which includes patents and design rights, would make Puerto Rico less attractive for business, compared with foreign countries that offer lower tax rates for manufacturers, said Ramón Ponte, president of the Puerto Rico C.P.A. society. “A lot of companies are going to look at the numbers and decide that, under the circumstances, it’s better to leave,” he said. “The issue is not Puerto Rico versus the mainland: It’s really Puerto Rico versus its competitiveness with other foreign jurisdictions.” If Republicans want to protect American jobs, as President Trump has pledged, then Congress should consider Puerto Rico a domestic entity, said Mr. Rosselló, who spent last Wednesday on Capitol Hill, making one last push for support. The governor predicted the tax plan would renew debate on the island about its commonwealth status. A vote on the tax bill could come as early as Monday or Tuesday. Mr. Rosselló accused Republican leaders — several of whom made highly publicized trips to Puerto Rico after Maria — of reneging on Congress’s commitment to help the island regain its financial footing. Photo Mylan, a mainland pharmaceutical company with operations in Puerto Rico, would be one of the businesses affected by the new tax. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times “Congress essentially turned its back on Puerto Rico, and essentially failed in its mission,” said Mr. Rosselló, a member of the island’s pro-statehood New Progressive Party who also identifies as a Democrat. “It’s just penalizing Puerto Rico. It’s putting Puerto Rico in a worse-off position than it was yesterday.” Last year, a special law — called Promesa, or “promise” in Spanish — was enacted to restructure Puerto Rico’s more than $70 billion debt. It established an eight-member, bipartisan task force that concluded in a December 2016 report that Congress needed to address the complex federal tax policy for Puerto Rico. The report underscored that jobs on the island and in other territories — including the United States Virgin Islands, which were also hammered by Hurricanes Irma and Maria — are American jobs. “The Task Force believes that Puerto Rico is too often relegated to an afterthought in congressional deliberations over federal business tax reform legislation,” lawmakers wrote. The group said it was “open” to giving tax incentives to American companies on the island as long as they were geared toward improving Puerto Rico’s economy and raising employment, as opposed to bolstering companies’ bottom lines. A 2012 Senate investigation found that Microsoft employed 177 workers on Puerto Rico, but reported some $4 billion in earnings there from profits channeled to the island to reduce the software giant’s tax burden. Microsoft sold brands and copyrights — that is, intellectual property — to its Puerto Rican affiliate to avoid paying higher mainland taxes. Among the task force’s recommendations that the final tax bill ignored: allowing lower-income Puerto Rican families with one or two children to qualify for an additional child-tax credit that currently kicks in only after a third child. Last month, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said lawmakers would address Puerto Rico’s tax concerns in negotiations with the Senate. “It is our intention to make improvements to our tax reform legislation as it relates to Puerto Rico when we go to conference,” Mr. Ryan said in a Nov. 16 statement issued jointly with Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress. Now, however, it appears Puerto Rico’s requests will have to wait until next year, when Congress could draft bills to extend tax credits or make technical corrections to the law. One of Ms. González-Colón’s suggestions, to create “opportunity zones” offering tax incentives for manufacturing, remains a possibility, said Representative Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. “I think more can be done as well, but I think this is important,” he said. “We are just absolutely committed to helping that island rebuild.” Still pending before Congress is Puerto Rico’s request for more than $94 billion in hurricane relief aid. The island continues to suffer deeply after Maria: Only 65 percent of its power generation has been restored. An exodus of Puerto Ricans has taken away workers crucial to reigniting the economy. More than 243,000 people have landed in Florida from the island since Oct. 3. Puerto Rico is sensitive to tax decisions made in Washington. In 1996, President Bill Clinton authorized the repeal of a 1976 provision that gave American companies significant tax incentives to establish their subsidiaries on the island. Those perks helped turn the island into a biotech manufacturing hub, but critics countered that most of the benefit went to wealthy investors, not local workers. Once the incentives were fully phased out in 2006, at a time when manufacturing was declining across the nation, Puerto Rico plunged into a recession that has lasted for more than a decade.

Frederic Lardinois,"OpenStack is one of the most important and complex open-source projects you’ve never heard of. It’s a set of tools that allows large enterprises ranging from Comcast and PayPal to stock exchanges and telecom providers to run their own AWS-like cloud services inside their data centers. Only a few years ago, there was a lot of hype around OpenStack as the project went through the usual hype cycle. Now, we’re talking about a stable project that many of the most valuable companies on earth rely on. But this also means the ecosystem around it — and the foundation that shepherds it — is now trying to transition to this next phase. The OpenStack project was founded by Rackspace and NASA in 2010. Two years later, the growing project moved into the OpenStack Foundation, a nonprofit group that set out to promote the project and help manage the community. When it was founded, OpenStack still had a few competitors, like CloudStack and Eucalyptus. OpenStack, thanks to the backing of major companies and its fast-growing community, quickly became the only game in town, though. With that, community events like the OpenStack Summit started to draw thousands of developers, and with each of its semi-annual releases, the number of contributors to the project has increased. Now, that growth in contributors has slowed and, as evidenced by the attendance at this week’s Summit in Vancouver. In the early days, there were also plenty of startups in the ecosystem — and the VC money followed them, together with some of the most lavish conference parties (or “bullshit,” as Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth called it ) that I have experienced. The OpenStack market didn’t materialize quite as fast as many had hoped, though, so some of the early players went out of business, some shut down their OpenStack units and others sold to the remaining players. Today, only a few of the early players remain standing, and the top players are now the likes of Red Hat, Canonical and Rackspace. And to complicate matters, all of this is happening in the shadow of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and the Kubernetes project it manages being in the early stages of the hype cycle. Meanwhile, the OpenStack Foundation itself is in the middle of its own transition as it looks to bring on other open-source infrastructure projects that are complementary to its overall mission of making open-source infrastructure easier to build and consume. Unsurprisingly, all of this clouded the mood at the OpenStack Summit this week, but I’m actually not part of the doom and gloom contingent. In my view, what we are seeing here is a mature open-source project that has gone through its ups and downs and now, with all of the froth skimmed off, it’s a tool that provides a critical piece of infrastructure for businesses. Canonical’s Mark Shuttleworth, who created his own bit of drama during his keynote by directly attacking his competitors like Red Hat, told me that low attendance at the conference may not be a bad thing, for example, since the people who are actually in attendance are now just trying to figure out what OpenStack is all about and are all potential customers. Others echoed a similar sentiment. “I think some of it goes with, to some extent, what’s been building over the last couple of Summits,” Bryan Thompson, Rackspace’s senior director and general manager for OpenStack, said as he summed up what I heard from a number of other vendors at the event. “That is: Is open stack dead? Is this going away? Or is everything just leapfrogging and going straight to Kubernetes on bare metal. And I don’t want to phrase it as ‘it’s a good thing,’ because I think it’s a challenge for the foundation and for the community. But I think it’s actually a positive thing because the core OpenStack services — the core projects — have just matured. We’re not in the early science experiment days of trying to push ahead and scale and grow the core projects, they were actually achieved and people are actually using it.” That current state produces fewer flashy headlines, but every survey, both from the Foundation itself and third-party analysts, show that the number of users — and their OpenStack clouds — continues to grow. Meanwhile, the Foundation is looking to bring up attendance at its events, too, by adding container and CI/CD tracks, for example. The company that maybe best exemplifies the ups and downs of OpenStack is Mirantis, a well-funded startup that has weathered the storm by reinventing itself multiple times. Mirantis started as one of the first OpenStack distributions and contributors to the project. During those early days, it raised one of the largest funding rounds in the OpenStack world with a $100 million Series B round, which was quickly followed by another $100 million round in 2015. But by early 2017, Mirantis had pivoted from being a distribution and toward offering managed services for open-source platforms. It also made an early bet on Kubernetes and offered services for that, too. And then this year, it added yet another twist to its corporate story by refocusing its efforts on the Netflix-incubated Spinnaker open-source tool and helping companies build their CI/CD pipelines based on that. In the process, the company shrunk from almost 1,000 employees to 450 today, but as Mirantis CEO and co-founder Boris Renski told me, it’s now cash-flow positive. So just as the OpenStack Foundation is moving toward CI/CD with its Zuul tool, Mirantis is betting on Spinnaker, which solves some of the same issues, but with an emphasis on integrating multiple code repositories. Renski, it’s worth noting, actually advocated for bringing Spinnaker into the OpenStack foundation (it’s currently managed on a more ad hoc basis by Netflix and Google). “We need some governance, we need some process,” Renski said. “The [OpenStack] Foundation is known for actually being very good and effectively seeding this kind of formalized, automated and documented governance in open source and the two should work together much closer. I think that Spinnaker should become part of the Foundation. That’s the opportunity and I think it should focus 150 percent of their energy on that before it builds its own thing and before [Spinnaker] goes off to the CNCF as yet another project.” So what does the Foundation think about all of this? In talking to OpenStack CTO Mark Collier and Executive Director Jonathan Bryce over the last few months, it’s clear that the Foundation knows that change is needed. That process started with opening up the Foundation to other projects, making it more akin to the Linux Foundation, where Linux remains in the name as its flagship project, but where a lot of the energy now comes from projects it helps manage, including the likes of the CNCF and Cloud Foundry. At the Sydney Summit last year, the team told me that part of the mission now is to retask the large OpenStack community to work on these new topics around open infrastructure. This week, that message became clearer. “Our mission is all about making it easier for people to build and operate open infrastructure,” Bryce told me this week. “And open infrastructure is about operating functioning services based off of open source tool. So open source is not enough. And we’ve been, you know, I think, very, very oriented around a set of open source projects. But in the seven years since we launched, what we’ve seen is people have taken those projects, they’ve turned it into services that are running and then they piled a bunch of other stuff on top of it — and that becomes really difficult to maintain and manage over the long term.” So now, going forward, that part about maintaining these clouds is becoming increasingly important for the project. “Open source is not enough,” is an interesting phrase here, because that’s really at the core of the issue at hand. “The best thing about open source is that there’s more of it than ever,” said Bryce. “And it’s also the worst thing. Because the way that most open source communities work is that it’s almost like having silos of developers inside of a company — and then not having them talk to each other, not having them test together, and then expecting to have a coherent, easy to use product come out at the end of the day.” And Bryce also stressed that projects like OpenStack can’t be only about code. Moving to a cloud-native development model, whether that’s with Kubernetes on top of OpenStack or some other model, is about more than just changing how you release software. It’s also about culture. “We realized that this was an aspect of the foundation that we were under-prioritizing,” said Bryce. “We focused a lot on the OpenStack projects and the upstream work and all those kinds of things. And we also built an operator community, but I think that thinking about it in broader terms lead us to a realization that we had last year. It’s not just about OpenStack. The things that we have done to make OpenStack more usable apply broadly to these businesses [that use it], because there isn’t a single one that’s only running OpenStack. There’s not a single one of them.” More and more, the other thing they run, besides their legacy VMware stacks, is containers and specifically containers managed with Kubernetes, of course, and while the OpenStack community first saw containers as a bit of a threat, the Foundation is now looking at more ways to bring those communities together, too. What about the flagging attendance at the OpenStack events? Bryce and Collier echoed what many of the vendors also noted. “In the past, we had something like 7,000 developers — something insane — but the bulk of the code comes down to about 200 or 300 developers,” said Bryce. Even the somewhat diminished commercial ecosystem doesn’t strike Bryce and Collier as too much of an issue, in part because the Foundation’s finances are closely tied to its membership. And while IBM dropped out as a project sponsor, Tencent took its place. “There’s the ecosystem side in terms of who’s making a product and selling it to people,” Collier acknowledged. “But for whom is this so critical to their business results that they are going to invest in it. So there’s two sides to that, but in terms of who’s investing in OpenStack and the Foundation and making all the software better, I feel like we’re in a really good place.” He also noted that the Foundation is seeing lots of investment in China right now, so while other regions may be slowing down, others are picking up the slack. So here is an open-source project in transition — one that has passed through the trough of disillusionment and hit the plateau of productivity, but that is now looking for its next mission.

Andrew Freedman,"It all started innocently enough. Shortly before New Year's celebrations kicked off in the Southeast, a record-cold air mass blew in from the north. This air had a direct connection to the Arctic, spilling out as if someone left the Northern Hemisphere's refrigerator door open. This frigid air oozed across the Gulf of Mexico, into Florida, and served as one of the catalysts for a low pressure area to develop in the Bahamas on Tuesday. Snow flurries were even reported on an oil platform off the coast of Louisiana. SEE ALSO: Incredible photos from space show off the historic East Coast 'bomb cyclone' The cold air sitting over unusually warm Atlantic Ocean waters helped set up a huge thermal, or heat, contrast, which the East Coast's bomb cyclone was then able to take advantage of and intensify at nearly unheard of rates late Wednesday and Thursday. During the 24 hour period ending at 10 a.m. ET on Thursday morning, the storm's central air pressure dropped by 59 millibars, to 951 millibars, which put the blizzard in the upper echelon of rapidly intensifying storms. No other non-tropical storm has intensified this rapidly off the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coast in the past 30 years or more.

So much to see! pic.twitter.com/OS4hLO9wOd — Jeff Frame (@VORTEXJeff) January 4, 2018 After the cold air moved into the Southeast, all that was needed for a storm to form was a trigger to come along. Mother Nature delivered multiple triggers on Wednesday, when three distinct, potent waves of energy embedded within the jet stream moved over the area. According to meteorologist Alex Lamers of the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, meteorologists are scrambling to understand how this storm got so strong, so quickly. The temperature contrast was just one of the key ingredients that set this storm off, he said. “You had a really anomalously cold air mass south to the Gulf,"" Lamers said in an interview. “I think that was a big driver, just the big gradients in temperature and moisture,” he said. Some other factors, he said, may not be known now, and will require further study by researchers. “I think that was probably a big factor, and then jet [stream] dynamics probably played a big role too,” Lamers said. Winds at the upper levels of the atmosphere, within the highway of air that steers weather systems, promoted ascending air and storm intensification, Lamers said. 10 AM official WPC analysis has low pressure down to 951mb, a remarkable drop of 59 millibars in 24 hours. Also 38mb in the last 12 hours. pic.twitter.com/TgoLDS9J7h — Alex Lamers (@AlexJLamers) January 4, 2018 Sam Lillo, a meteorology Phd. student at the University of Oklahoma, said the jet stream disturbances acted ""like a vacuum, evacuating mass out of the column of atmosphere [and] resulting in decreasing pressure at the surface."" ""Even one shortwave interacting with the low and its subtropical connection would've resulted in a strong Atlantic storm. The three shortwaves also aren't perfectly phasing, so the actual ceiling for the strength of this storm was likely even higher."" Another ingredient in the bomb cyclone was unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Western Atlantic, Lillo said in a Twitter message. ""These origins, along with the unusually high Atlantic sea surface temperatures are important because there has been extraordinary influence from latent heat fluxes and deep convection in this storm...,"" he said, referring to the formation of powerful thunderstorms as part of the low pressure area. The above normal sea surface temperatures also produced an unusually sharp zone of temperature contrasts, which helped to fuel the low pressure area, Lamers said. Such storms, after all, feed off of the differences in air masses, so the bigger the contrast in air masses, the stronger the storm may get.

The main difference between a rapidly intensifying storm like the one on Thursday and one that intensifies at a more typical rate for the Northeast is that storms that undergo bombogenesis tend to produce higher wind gusts, as well as more thunderstorms. They can also be more difficult to predict, since computer models may struggle to predict their complex evolution. With winds gusting to at least 80 miles per hour, and a foot-plus of snow already falling in the Mid-Atlantic and New England, it's clear that the bomb cyclone of 2018 lived up to most of the hype. Now it's up to meteorologists to figure out how to better predict more storms like it in the future.","It all started innocently enough.

Ed Cara,"A California family plagued by bed bugs for months has come away with some solace: On Wednesday, a civil court jury ordered their former landlords to pay them $1.6 million over the ordeal. In 2012, Liliana Martinez and her husband alleged in their complaint, their apartment complex in Inglewood, California became infested with bed bugs. They complained to the management company that maintained their building, Westland Industries, and had their home fumigated and furniture thrown out. But the bugs kept on biting over the next four months, only being eradicated after numerous complaints and the complete removal of carpeting from the home. In 2014, after they moved out, they sued the owners, Amusement Six Apartments, for breach of warranty of habitability, emotional distress, negligence, and breach of contract. During the infestation, their 3-year-old son Jorge Maravilla Jr. reportedly become so ridden with bites that he developed permanent scars from scratching them, while their 3-month-old daughter was bitten repeatedly on her back as she slept. The shoddy attempts to fix their situation, along with a concurrent cockroach infestation, the family alleged, left them feeling as they lived in “slum-type living conditions.” “It was very emotional, seeing my son going through that itching and all that bleeding,” Liliana Martinez told CBSLA. The jury ultimately sided with them, awarding the family exactly $1,593,500 in damages. The young son was personally awarded over $800,000. “I really think it’s important to give a voice to those who don’t have a voice or who can’t stand up for justice on their own,” the family’s lawyer, Brian Virag, told the New York Times. Virag has represented clients in other civil bed bug lawsuits, including a recent case in which residents of another Los Angeles apartment complex were awarded a $3.5 million. Virag says the $1.6 million award is the largest he’s seen for a single-family lawsuit. Bed bugs have become notoriously difficult to get rid of in recent years, thanks to their growing resistance to once-foolproof chemical pesticides. It’s believed this resistance, along with other factors, has allowed them to storm back from being nearly wiped out in the middle of the 20th century. And nowadays, experts recommend a combination of chemical and non-chemical approaches (such as cooking them to death with steam) to eradicate them. In addition to being an emotionally draining nightmare, some recent research has suggested that bed bugs could also be a serious health risk, thanks to the copious amounts of histamine they leave behind in their poop. Martinez says they will use the money to help fund their son’s medical care.

Miriam Kramer,"We all know about Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the extreme, Earth-sized storm that's been swirling on the huge planet for decades. But what about the world's other, less well known tempests? A series of studies published in the journal Nature this week reveal new discoveries about the way that Jupiter's atmosphere functions and the storms that swirl within it. In particular, one of the studies details the nature of the cyclones spinning in the clouds of Jupiter's north and south poles. SEE ALSO: This is what Jupiter sounds like In the planet's north pole, one large cyclone is surrounded by eight other polar cyclones, and a large south polar cyclone is encircled by five cyclones, according to the new study produced using data from NASA's Jupiter-exploring Juno probe. A computer-generated image showing Jupiter's south pole. Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM ""Prior to Juno we did not know what the weather was like near Jupiter's poles. Now, we have been able to observe the polar weather up-close every two months,"" Alberto Adriani, Juno co-investigator, and lead author of the cyclone study, said in a statement. ""Each one of the northern cyclones is almost as wide as the distance between Naples, Italy and New York City — and the southern ones are even larger than that. They have very violent winds, reaching, in some cases, speeds as great as 220 mph (350 kph). Finally, and perhaps most remarkably, they are very close together and enduring. There is nothing else like it that we know of in the solar system."" That's for sure. Jupiter's storms are complex beasts that defy explanation at this point. The dynamics of the storms in the south and north poles of the world are mysterious, and scientists aren't sure how they formed or how they have persisted. Even Saturn's storms aren't a good proxy for the dynamics at play on Jupiter. Saturn actually has one hexagon-shaped storm at each pole, so why does Jupiter have more than one and why don't they merge together? It's also odd that the cyclones at the north and south pole on Jupiter aren't the same. ""The Juno observations so far provide concrete evidence that the Jovian poles display multitudes of structure at its poles, but that structure is not identical at both poles, even though the stability and structures have remained stable over 11-months,"" planetary scientist Padma Yanamandra-Fisher, who wasn't an author on the new study, said via email. ""How? Why? These are questions that will engage Jovian researchers for years to come."" In general, storms on Jupiter are pretty badass. A storm called the North North Temperate Little Red Spot 1 is 3,700 miles across. Yes, a storm that's over 3,000 miles across — which is roughly the distance from California to New York — is considered ""little"" on Jupiter. The huge planet's storms can also swirl for years and years because Jupiter, unlike Earth, doesn't have any continents that would break up airflow feeding these tempests.","We all know about Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the extreme, Earth-sized storm that's been swirling on the huge planet for decades.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper called the storm ""historic"" The outer bands of Hurricane Florence are lashing parts of the US East Coast. Officials warn of life-threatening storm surges in both North and South Carolina as the hurricane moves towards land with maximum sustained wind speeds of 100mph (155 km/h). More than 100,000 homes are already without power as weather conditions begin to worsen. Officials have warned the storm has the potential to kill ""a lot of people"" amid risks of ""catastrophic"" flooding. More than a million people along the coastlines of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia have been ordered to evacuate. Thousands had taken shelter in emergency facilities by Thursday night. Photographs showed residents crowded into corridors with blankets on inflatable mattresses and mats. What is the latest? Conditions deteriorated throughout Thursday as wind speeds gradually strengthened in coastal areas. Some areas of North Carolina saw almost a foot of rain just a few hours, and footage showed sea levels begin to surge in land. Media caption BBC on the ground as Hurricane Florence arrives For now Hurricane Florence remains a category two storm, with no significant weakening expected before the hurricane's eye makes landfall on Friday morning. The National Hurricane Centre (NHC) says that despite the gradual lowering in wind strength, the storm remains extremely dangerous because of the high volume of rainfall and storm surges predicted. Media caption Why do people ignore hurricane warnings? ""Inland flooding kills a lot of people unfortunately and that's what we're about to see,"" Fema administrator Brock Long told a news conference on Thursday morning. He said that people living near rivers, streams and lowland areas in the region were most at risk. How bad is it expected to get? The latest weather predictions show the storm slowing to a near standstill as it pummels the coast with ""copious amounts of rain"" from Thursday night to Saturday. Wind speeds are only expected to weaken on Saturday as the storm moves slowly across land. Meteorologists have warned floodwaters may rise up to 13ft (4m) in areas as some rivers see their flows ""reversed"". Media caption People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane Parts of the Carolina coast are expecting 20-30 (50-75cm) inches of rain, with isolated regions seeing up to 40in of downpour. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, is imposing a 12-hour curfew from 19:00 local time on Thursday. Petrol stations in the area are reporting shortages and energy companies predict that one to three million homes and businesses may lose power. Officials have warned restorations to electricity could take days or even weeks. Over 1,400 flights have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com, as most of the coastal region's airports are closed to ride out the storm. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned people: ""Today the threat becomes a reality."" Emergency workers are arriving from other parts of the US to aid in rescues. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.

Is global warming to blame? The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas.

Reuters Editorial,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Seven refineries in eastern Louisiana plan to continue normal operations while keeping a careful eye on Tropical Storm Gordon, whose forecast path moved eastward on Tuesday with landfall in Mississippi, said sources familiar with plant operations. Being west of the storm, the refineries should be on the side of Gordon producing the least rain and wind, though all of the plants have prepared for high wind and possible flooding. At PBF Energy’s 190,000 bpd Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery, which is 72 miles (116 km) west of Biloxi, Mississippi, where Gordon is forecast to make landfall, scaffolding erected for planned maintenance has been removed until the storm ends, sources familiar with plant operations said. No change in operations were planned at the Chalmette refinery, the sources said. A PBF spokesman declined to discuss operations at the plant. The Valero Energy Corp 125,000 bpd plant in Meraux, Louisiana, also plans to keep running as usual overnight and into Wednesday. “Business as usual,” said a source familiar with plant operations at the Meraux refinery. A Valero spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment about operations at Meraux. Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s refineries in Convent and Norco, Louisiana, are prepared for high wind and rain, a company spokesman said. Operations at the 502,500 bpd Exxon Mobil Corp refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were normal on Tuesday, said Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin. The company has activated its storm preparedness plan for the refinery and adjoining chemical plant, Nordin said. Production is expected to continue normally overnight and into Wednesday at the Baton Rouge complex, said sources familiar with plant operations. Phillips 66’s 247,000 bpd refinery in Alliance, Louisiana, was operating normally on Tuesday, a company spokesman said. A spokesman for Marathon Petroleum Corp declined to discuss operations at the company’s at the company’s 556,000 bpd Garyville, Louisiana, refinery.

FRANCES ROBLES,"The bureaucracy around the housing repairs was so complex that the first repairs did not begin until more than five months after the hurricane. A full year after the September 2017 storm, a New York Times review found that thousands of Puerto Ricans were still living in ruined houses. For many of them, the FEMA money left over after trickling down through so many middlemen hardly made a dent in what they needed. Lisandra Oquendo, who lives in Punta Santiago on Puerto Ricos eastern coast, was told that her house had been approved for $18,000 in FEMA repair funds, and she was stunned at how little was accomplished with the money. The contractors patched up her roof, gave her a generator, replaced more than a dozen broken window crank operators, installed several appliances, two windows and a door, and cleaned mold off the walls. But because her roof is made of concrete, she said, they told her they could not repair it. They said, We dont do paint, we dont do floors, we dont work with cement, she said. So what do you do? Contractors have said that the rates they collect cover a variety of expenses, including shipping fees, workers compensation insurance, vehicle and warehouse rental, taxes and profit. But prices charged for equipment and appliances often bore little relation to what was charged on the retail market, even in storm-ravaged Puerto Rico. According to Department of Housing records, FEMA paid for about 12,400 people to receive generators at a cost of $3,700 each. The 5,500-watt portable devices and supplies they came with cost the contractors about $800 each, other documents show. FEMA paid $666 apiece for new bathroom sinks, but the contractors who actually bought and installed them paid $260 apiece. FEMA paid almost $4 a square foot to repair roofs; the work was done by subcontractors for $1.64 a foot. The deal the Department of Housing signed required smoke detectors in every sleeping area, so each of the 122,000 houses in the program was equipped with the devices, for which FEMA was billed $82 apiece. A receipt reviewed by The New York Times showed that one subcontractor ordered them in bulk from an Ace Hardware store in the city of Aguadilla for $6.99 each. Fifty-eight percent is being taken off the top as overhead and profit from the two contractors above us, said Brandon Padgett, owner of BVP Construction in Houston, which conducted repairs on 52 houses under the program. Is there 58 percent overhead and profit needed to implement this? No, because we are doing 90 percent of the work.","FEMA is spending more than $1 billion on emergency repairs to homes in Puerto Rico damaged by Hurricane Maria, but much of it is going to contractors charging steep markups and overhead.",2018-11-26T10:00:19Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","$3,700 Generators and $666 Sinks: FEMA Contractors Charged Steep Markups on Puerto Rico Repairs",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/fema-puerto-rico-housing-repairs-maria.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/us/prcontract-promo/prcontract-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,storm complex,1

Sometimes her intention is to capture the smell of the park after a storm, or a flower she’s found there, sometimes what she’s foraged will become one of some 40 ingredients that make up an entirely different, often complex perfume. “I like to gather all my subjects,” she says, as her feisty Border terrier, Pop, investigates a patch of sticky willow. “This is the beginning of the process for me.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Hurricane Sandy was one of the most destructive storms in U.S. history. But beyond the catastrophic losses of life and property, the storm also dealt a blow to the American weather modeling community. The American weather model whiffed on the initial forecast, but its European counterpart was dead on. Nearly six years later and the phrase “the Euro nailed Sandy” is still a running joke in the meteorological community, shorthand for both the continued superiority of the European model’s ability to predict major weather events like hurricanes while also mocking people who obsess over a model that has its own deficiencies and occasional high profile whiffs. Behind the scenes, though, the weather modeling arms race is heating up with the American model getting a major upgrade early next year. This competition about more than model supremacy: Lives and property are at stake. Witness last year, when weather disasters cost the U.S. a record-setting $306 billion. In Puerto Rico, the disastrous Hurricane Maria claimed an estimated 3,000 lives according to a government-commissioned survey published this week. An increase in extreme weather brought on by climate change only makes it more important for our weather models to get it right. Step outside and the weather is inherently obvious and easy to understand. The sun kisses your skin, the warm air causes the sweat to build behind your knees, maybe a slight breeze ruffles the grass. You pop your umbrella open as a thunderstorm pours and run to the basement as a tornado touches down. But these basic experiences are the result of a chaotic series of interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, sea ice, incoming sunlight, and a host of other planetary-scale features. Models are how we try to make sense of all this complexity, and meteorologists use them as guidance when they’re forecasting hurricanes, snowstorms, or the chance of an afternoon shower. There are a ton of weather models out there. National meteorological agencies make most of them but so do private companies (did you know Panasonic—yes, the electronics company— nailed Irma ?). For much of the world, however, two models are the backbone of forecasting: the Euro, and the American model known as the Global Forecast System (the GFS). These models are created and maintained by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), respectively. The two agencies were founded with divergent missions, which in part informs some of the differences in their weather models today. NOAA is focused on “climate, weather, oceans and coasts” while ECMMWF was established to “produce accurate climate data and medium-range forecasts,” or forecasts generally covering the range of 3-7 days. “The European Center has a very narrow mission compared to either the [UK] Met Office or the U.S. National Weather Service (which is part of NOAA),” Richard Rood, a weather and climate expert at the University of Michigan, told Earther. “That mission is medium range forecasting, that is what they do very very well. In the U.S., our resources—which are quite substantial—are diffused across a larger set of products.” The “Euro nailed Sandy” meme arose because ECMWF had Sandy’s weird track pegged more than a week out. The GFS eventually worked out the same track for the storm. Similarly, the Euro bested the GFS when it came to Hurricane Joaquin last year when it consistently and correctly predicted the storm would stay out to sea (the GFS had it coming ashore along the Mid-Atlantic for a while). John Morales, the chief meteorologist WTVJ in Miami who has seen no shortage of hurricane model runs, told Earther he relies heavily on both models for short-term forecasts. “However, for days 3-7, while still looking at the output from both models, I lean strongly towards the European global model,” he said. “It truly is difficult to beat, especially in the medium range.” So what’s the Euro’s special sauce? The scale of computing power each agency has at its disposal is measured in petaflops. To put that measure in perspective, it would take your measly human brain 31.7 million years to do the number of calculations that a one petaflop computing system can do in a second. NOAA has computers capable of reaching 8.4 petaflops, ECMWF tops out at around 8.5 petaflops. All that power allows each group to run its model fast enough to spit out results for the entire planet a few times a day at fairly high resolution. The Euro recreates conditions up to 50 miles (80 kilometers) into the atmosphere and has a resolution on the ground of roughly 5.6 miles (9 kilometers). The GFS runs simulates the atmosphere up to 33 miles (53 kilometers) above the surface with a resolution of eight miles (13 kilometers). That resolution difference is partly why the GFS isn’t as strong as its European counterpart when it comes to forecasting specific weather events. It’s essentially looking at the atmosphere with slightly blurry vision, while the Euro’s view is closer to 20/20 vision. But there’s another key difference, which is how the two groups use data to start their models running. The Euro uses continuous data compiled from satellites and weather stations over a 12 hour period to set up initial conditions. These essentially give the model a sense of what the planet’s weather has been up to lately. “This allows [the Euro] to make better use of observations and especially satellite observations which come in a nearly continuous stream,” Massimo Bonavita, a senior scientist working on at data assimilation at ECMWF, told Earther. In comparison, the GFS assimilates a few snapshots of data. Basically, by the time the GFS gets out of the starting gates, the Euro already has a running start. “[The question is] how do we do something disruptive to make the step to the next level, not how do we catch up?” But help is on the way on many fronts for the GFS. A new version of the model is coming in early 2019. It will run on a new dynamic core, something that Brian Gross, a senior advisor for the unified forecast system at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (which is part of NOAA), likened to the engine of a car. “Replacing the engine is much like you do if you replace engine in your car,” he said. “You will get a lot more miles out of this. That will future-proof us, [allowing us to run] higher resolution models with more advanced physics.” The new engine is already being tested alongside the current GFS and Gross said the early results are “pretty encouraging in terms of forecast track improvement intensity improvements” for hurricanes. The next generation of the GFS is hardly the end of the line for weather modeling. Neil Jacobs, a NOAA deputy administrator appointed by Trump, told Capital Weather Gang in April that improving weather modeling is a “top priority of the administration.” There are also efforts afoot to create something called an unified forecast system, which will basically take all the models under NOAA’s purview from the GFS to ice, ocean, land, and more and link them up into what will be a super model game of telephone. “You don’t exactly have one model that does everything,” Rood, who is part of task force working on that project, said. “What the unified system gives you is a more controlled environment for prediction problems.” Those problems can range from will it rain in Omaha in the next few hours to will Nebraska face drought conditions in the next four weeks. Rood added that the most important question about how to improve American weather forecasting is “how do we do something disruptive to make the step to the next level, not how do we catch up.” Social media has played no small role in stoking the feud between the Euro and the GFS. You can find people saying things like the GFS “ crapped it’s [sic] pants ” forecasting Hurricane Lane or that it whipped up a “ scare-icane ” earlier this summer, as well as the fact that it “ nailed the forecast for Harvey.” Will meteorologists and armchair weather forecasters ever stop fighting about these two weather models and their battle for supremacy? Probably not. But things are a little more subdued behind the scenes. Gross told me that I would be “disappointed” if I was searching for beef between NOAA and ECMWF. “A measure of friendly competition has always been present among major forecasting centres,” Bonavita said. “This is actually very positive because it stimulates development and provides diversity in the forecasting ecosystem.” Indeed, both centers collaborate, sending scientists across the Atlantic to learn from each other. And it’s not like the Euro never comes in second place. The model infamously whiffed on what ended up being a minor Mid-Atlantic snowstorm this year, calling for up to 20 inches of snow in Washington, D.C. And both the Euro and GFS see skill drop offs in the summer and have biases toward warmth or cold and wet or dry in certain locales. “There are a lot of statistical analysis that show the Euro being superior, but the Euro operational model can, at times, be wildly inconsistent with forecast solutions too,” Matt Lanza, a Houston-based meteorologist and managing editor of Space City Weather, told Earther. “We are taught that it’s called model ‘guidance’ for a reason. Guidance doesn’t mean an answer key; it’s meant to guide you through a complex process.” Indeed, that’s why anyone flashing a model run on social media without caveats is a huge red flag. Models aren’t forecasts, they’re one possible outcome in an inherently messy system. Ultimately, it requires people to interpret them. “I consider the human element in the forecast a strong suit,” Morales said. “My experience allows me to recognize patterns and understand biases. Generally our human-produced forecast is significantly more reliable than the machine forecast alone.” The same sentiment echoes among the folks behind the machines, too. “We’re a community that’s fascinated by the science and the ability to provide useful information to our customers,” Gross said. “We all have something to contribute.”","Hurricane Sandy was one of the most destructive storms in U.S. history.

Rachel Becker,"Climate change is already making devastating hurricanes wetter — and similar storms are likely to unleash more rain and faster winds by the end of the century, new research says. When Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria struck the US in rapid succession in the fall of 2017, the storms and their aftermaths killed thousands of people and caused an estimated $265 billion in damage. Harvey became the second costliest storm after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. Now, new research published today in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world. The study also predicts that in a warmer future, these storms would be even wetter and windier. A second paper (also published today in Nature) took a closer look at Hurricane Harvey. It shows another way people may have made the storm’s rain and flooding more severe: by building cities. Hurricanes should, theoretically, be more intense and wetter on a hotter planet. After all, warm ocean water fuels hurricanes, and warmer air holds more moisture — which means more rain. Recent studies back that up; analyses of Hurricane Harvey, for instance, reported that 15 percent or more of the rainfall could be attributed to global warming. “It’s a very important confirmation.” Today’s paper provides yet more evidence about the ways in which climate change shapes extreme weather events, says Dim Coumou, an atmospheric scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who was not involved in the study. “It’s a very important confirmation of our understanding of how hurricanes change with global warming.” Climate scientist Michael Mann says that some of the results make perfect sense. “We expect greater rainfall and flooding from hurricanes as ocean surface temperatures and atmospheric moisture content increases in a warming world.” But he cautions that the papers use a single climate model, so “it is difficult to draw other general conclusions from these studies.” The study started because Christina Patricola, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wanted to find out how exactly climate change fit into the recent spate of devastating storms. So she simulated more than a dozen hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina. She and her co-author Michael Wehner plugged in ocean temperature, atmospheric conditions, and watched the simulated storms spin toward land. The models weren’t perfect, the study acknowledges: the simulations didn’t quite capture Hurricane Maria’s track, or the rapid intensifications of Katrina, Maria, and Irma. But the models were close — and that’s where the experiments could start. Patricola tweaked the conditions to watch what would happen if Katrina, Irma, and Maria had unfolded in a pre-industrial world, and found that global warming boosted the deluge by between 4 and 9 percent. The team also analyzed wind speeds, but didn’t see much of a contribution of global warming for the recent storms. That could change in the future. Patricola found that if we continue to burn fossil fuels unchecked through the year 2100, some of those same storms would drop 25 to 30 percent more rain, and the winds would blow up to 33 miles per hour faster. It’s a thorough, convincing study, Coumou says — but there are still some big questions left to answer. The study doesn’t examine how climate change might alter the speed at which hurricanes travel along their paths, for example, or how future hurricane rainfall and storm surge might combine to drive heavy flooding. The question of flooding is where today’s second study comes in. Hydrologist Gabriele Villarini at the University of Iowa and his colleagues at Princeton University took a close look at Hurricane Harvey, which dumped five feet of rain on Houston and killed at least 93 people. Previous studies analyzed at how much of that rainfall could be attributed to global warming, and found it was around 15 precent or more. And we’d expect that when developers slap down impermeable surfaces like concrete and asphalt, the amount of water slicking off those surfaces increases. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important.” But Villarini’s team took a slightly different tack and looked at how the city’s footprint and skyline might have changed both runoff and the rain. They modeled how much rain the hurricane would have dropped on the city had the buildings been replaced with farm fields. And they found that the rough texture of the city with its buildings and complicated skyline snagged and slowed down the humid air flowing over it, boosting conditions for precipitation. To be clear, Hurricane Harvey would have dropped rain over Houston no matter what was there. But the presence of the city exacerbated the flooding across Houston by about 21 times, on average, the study says. The team doesn’t know precisely why. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important,” Villarini says. They also don’t know if these findings are specific to Harvey, or whether they’d hold up when another storm hits a different city. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem.” Still, the findings suggest that urbanization could make the flooding impacts of hurricanes worse, and in multiple different ways. “This is, as far as I know, a new result and, as the authors point out, has important implications for urban planning,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT who was not involved in the study, says in a statement emailed to The Verge. Together, the two studies show that we need to be ready for the complex ways a warmer world could change extreme weather events. And preparing for these events won’t be easy, according to Villarini. Politicians, urban developers, and engineers will all have to be involved, and will have to work together to figure out ways for their communities to survive future storms. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem,” he says.","New research published in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world.

ALAN BLINDER,"Free tarps are being handed out at the parking lot on 15th Street! The Federal Emergency Management Agency, fearing that unchecked rumors could create new perils, has turned to an increasingly familiar page in its response playbook and set up a web page labeled Hurricane Michael Rumor Control. Responding to speculation about payments at places like Sams Club, the agency wrote, FEMA is not writing checks to survivors in person at any locations. Points of distribution have FEMA- and state-provided supplies, including food and water that survivors can pick up for personal use. The solution for some is to try to avoid information entirely: I dont even listen to the radio right now, said Ryan Fountain, whose home in a nearby town suffered minor damage. While the internet helps emergency officials rebut speculation, researchers note that the same platforms often allow rumors to spread farther and faster than ever before. With cellphone service still at a premium the governors office reported that just 54 percent of service was restored in Bay County by Wednesday, a week after the storm it is harder to strike down speculation. The general public is not very good at differentiating truth from rumor related to disasters, Dr. Jun Zhuang, an associate professor at the University at Buffalo who received federal funding to study speculation after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, wrote in a summary of his findings. The public tends to spread rumors and is unlikely to correct false information, even after it has been debunked. Schools will be closed so long that students are certain to be held back! Ending a rumor is not easy. School administrators across the Panhandle, for example, are still assessing damage to buildings and mapping plans for the rest of the year. Ms. Sales county is flying a plane towing a banner a rare sight on the less-toured east side of the Hathaway Bridge over Panama City with tips about how to obtain updates, and is distributing fliers to residents. But she conceded that even emergency officials are prone to rumors, at least among themselves. Sometime on the day of the storm, she said, there was a call between the emergency operations center and someone about a firefighter. Then the buildings phone service went dead. Word spread through the Panhandle, including its emergency centers, that Bay Countys fortified complex was on fire. It was not.",Bed bugs have infested a shelter. FEMA is distributing free cash.

Marcus Gilmer,"President Donald Trump rode political conspiracy theories all the way to the White House, and now he now finds himself at the center of one. SEE ALSO: Mueller reportedly wants to question Trump about his Tweets By now, you've probably heard about QAnon, the online conspiracy theory figure whose following makes the Illuminati look like the burglars from Home Alone. Supporters of the conspiracy showed up at Trump's rally in Tampa on Tuesday and have even targeted Tom Hanks on YouTube, making their presence known in the mainstream. Trump has helped feed the beast, whether he knows it or not. The followers of ""Q"" are always on the lookout for clues anywhere, anything that reinforces their absurdly detailed, multi-layered mega-conspiracy — an umbrella that connects everything from the Mueller probe to Pizzagate to the 1999 death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. Even as the White House has tried to condemn these conspiracies, Trump's own words and actions have only hardened the resolve of the #QAnon crowd. Okay, what the hell is QAnon? While the QAnon conspiracy has been growing larger and larger, getting boosts from far-right celebs like Roseanne Barr and former MLB pitcher Curt Schilling, it didn't really hit the spotlight until Tuesday night. Since then, you can take your pick of explainers of the vast web of theories and how ""EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED."" It's such an incredibly, ever-evolving mess that, just like snowflakes, no two explainers are alike. You could delve into any number of them, from Vox to the New York Times to the Washington Post to Buzzfeed, and still not fully grasp the breadth of QAnon. At its core, the QAnon crowd believe a person with high intelligence clearance, named ""Q,"" has been posting clues (or ""drops"" or ""bread crumbs"") about how Trump is actually working to flush out enemies of the state on the anonymous image boards 4chan and 8chan. For instance, according to QAnon, the Mueller probe is actually Trump and Robert Mueller working together to bring down Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama who were actually the ones compromised by Vladimir Putin. And, along the way, Trump has, inadvertently or not, helped give the QAnon followers what they've been looking for: a ""storm"" that will cleanse the federal government for all good patriots. ""The calm before the storm"" Trump himself kicked off this whole mess with what, at the time, seemed like innocuous Trump bluster, violent bravado that was very much in line with previous comments he had made. During an October 2017 photo op with military staff, Trump said, “You guys know what this represents? Maybe it’s the calm before the storm.” TRUMP: ""Maybe it's the calm before the storm.""... REPORTER: ""What storm Mr. President?"" TRUMP: ""You'll find out."" (via Satellite News) pic.twitter.com/bWMzGrDPNa — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) October 5, 2017 Trump being Trump, he refused to elaborate on the comment, leading to speculation it could be a hint at forthcoming military operations. But the phrase ""the storm"" came to be the central point of a growing conspiracy that Trump was actually that major agent of change who had ascended to the White House to flush out members of the Deep State, Obama loyalists, and other ""enemies of the state."" It had conspiracy theorists already primed for when, three weeks later, the first ""drop"" from the mysterious ""Q"" was made on 4chan. The number 17 Perhaps the biggest QAnon clue that Trump repeatedly references, whether he knows it or not, is the number 17. Q is the 17th letter in the alphabet so it goes to follow that the number 17 holds a lot of significance for the QAnon believers. And those following the developments from this week raised a collective eyebrow when, on Wednesday morning following the rally where the QAnon supporters were spotted, Trump dashed out a tweet with the number 17 in it...This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2018 Now, Trump has tweeted the number 17 plenty of times before and had even explained his changing of his ""13 Angry Democrats"" phrase to ""17 Angry Democrats"" on Sunday, a fairly reasonable explanation, right? Nope. The number was out there, catching the attention of those over at Reddit's QAnon hub, r/greatawakening. r/greatawakening Image: mashable screenshot It even cropped up after Trump's call on Wednesday to Rush Limbaugh's show, he got flagged by the Reddit QAnon followers for saying he'd visited Washington 17 times before his election, echoing what he said at his Tuesday rally in Tampa. They believe Trump was sending them a message. And, if you want one more example of how deep the belief in ""17"" goes, consider that when Trump was given a jersey by the University of Alabama college football championship team that had the number 17 on it, the QAnon crowd went nuts (via the New York Times ). Of course, the number could refer to the fact that Alabama was champion of the 2017 season or that it was, according to Alabama, their 17th national championship. This seems pretty easy to explain away. But not to QAnon. To them, all of these were secret messages from the president, little winks to let them know he knows they know. Looking for anything And that's the thing about the QAnon crowd: the messages are often so cryptic and vague, you could warp just about anything to make it seem like it's connected, a benchmark of many conspiracy theories. When Trump dropped a few tweets with typos in them on Wednesday — again, a very normal Trump thing to do — QAnon followers went deep looking for hidden messages from Trump, noting his misspelling of ""smoking"" as ""smocking"" had a conspiratorial meaning and that multiple typos added up to a hidden message about, of course, Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. Another example of grasping for straws: an otherwise harmless tweet from Trump promoting ""Small Business Saturday."" From The Washington Post : Q once posted in entirety: _Conf_goTWIT_P_act-small#_ RED1_RED2_ Q Nonsense? Probably, but later that same afternoon in November, Trump tweeted, “Happy #SmallBusinessSaturday ” Small and small. To devotees, it’s proof that Trump really is working with Q. It's either a very, very deep and complex conspiracy Trump is working here or it's just one big game of Calvinball, where the rules and connections are made up as we go along. Everything Trump says and does can be twisted to meet QAnon's needs, a dangerous possibility considering Trump has never been one to reflect and choose his words carefully. Trump's conspiracy history Finally, the reason so many people are willing to embrace Trump as being at the center of such a sprawling conspiracy is because the president has himself embraced several baseless conspiracies. Whether it was the Obama "" birther"" theory that he helped spread, questioning Vince Foster's suicide, or suggesting Supreme Court justice Anton Scalia was murdered, Trump has been the poster child for conspiracy theorists. By even giving these theories (and more) a mere public nod, he's legitimized them in the minds of those who believe them, making it easier for them to believe he's at the center of QAnon's fantastical web. Where does it end? It's become serious enough that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about it on Wednesday during a press briefing. Sanders distanced the White House from QAnon by saying the president ""condemns and denounces any group that would incite violence against another individual."" But we've already seen what can happen when conspiracy theories can spill into real life violence, both with Pizzagate and, thanks to an incident a few weeks ago at the Hoover Dam, even QAnon. Whether QAnon leads to more violence remains to be seen.","President Donald Trump rode political conspiracy theories all the way to the White House, and now he now finds himself at the center of one.

Andrew Freedman,"Barely two months after wildfires swept across California wine country, a strong Santa Ana wind event propelled fast-moving flames across Ventura County, California on Monday night, killing at least one and destroying more than 100 homes. The blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, expanded from nothing to 31,000 acres in just a few hours thanks to fierce Santa Ana winds. The strong winds also caused power outages, plunging thousands of residents of Santa Barbara and Ventura into the dark as flames rushed in. SEE ALSO: 'We're just existing': What it was like to survive the deadly Northern California wildfires The fire has come close to downtown Ventura, a city of more than 100,000 people about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Social media images taken by evacuating residents show nightmarish scenes of onrushing flames. According to the Ventura County Fire Department, 27,000 people have evacuated. One of the structures that succumbed to the fast-moving flames was a large apartment complex. Santa Ana winds blow offshore, from east to west, tapping into warm and dry conditions inland. Close to the coast, these winds compress the air coming off the hills and mountains to the east, further warming and drying out the air mass, and helping to dry out already combustible vegetation. The fire threat had been anticipated, as the National Weather Service issued a rare ""critical"" fire outlook for Southern California on Tuesday due to the Santa Ana wind event. High wind warnings and red flag warnings were in effect for much of Southern California. The Thomas Fire was visible from space, via the Suomi-NPP satellite as well as other observing platforms. Heat signature from the Thomas Fire depicted from the Suomi-NPP satellite on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: NOAA. Typically, the fire season in Southern California peaks in October, but it can occasionally flare up again in November and December. In this case, a strong area of high pressure has built in across the West, and the clockwise air circulation around that high pressure is responsible for triggering the Santa Ana wind event. The Storm Prediction Center, which is part of the National Weather Service, issued a forecast discussion on Tuesday morning warning that fire weather conditions will further deteriorate during the day, as winds increase, humidity drops, and temperatures climb. The Weather Service has designated parts of Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernadino, and Riverside counties as being in ""extremely critical"" fire weather risk, which is the highest category. These areas could see sustained winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour, the Storm Prediction Center said, with gusts up to 80 miles per hour in hills and mountains. Relative humidity levels could drop to as low as 4 percent in these areas, the center stated. The immediate Los Angeles metropolitan area is included in the slightly less serious zone of ""critical"" fire danger. The October wildfires that killed more than 40 people and destroyed more than 10,000 structures in northern California also occurred during a period when strong, dry offshore winds were present. Such winds can allow a fire to spread quickly and erratically, including by spreading burning embers far out in front of the main blaze. This hampers firefighting efforts and can force hasty evacuations.","Barely two months after wildfires swept across California wine country, a strong Santa Ana wind event propelled fast-moving flames across Ventura County, California on Monday night, killing at least one and destroying more than 100 homes.

Reuters Editorial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s power company said it had restored power to over 1.1 million homes and businesses by Thursday morning after a transmission line failure cut service to almost all of the island’s 3.4 million residents the day before. The Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA, was working to restore power to the less than 30 percent of customers in the U.S. territory still without power after Wednesday morning’s blackout. The power line failure in southern Puerto Rico was the latest in a string of operational and political headaches for the bankrupt, storm-ravaged power utility. The utility has struggled to escape the headlines since Hurricane Maria wiped out power to all of Puerto Rico on Sept. 20. Maria, the worst storm to hit the island in 90 years, devastated Puerto Rico’s electrical grid, and thousands were still without power at the time of Wednesday’s blackout. PREPA said on Twitter that several power plants were back in service, including units at Central Aguirre, EcoElectrica, Central Costa Sur, Yabucoa and Palo Seco. The blackout was caused by the failure of a 230-kilovolt transmission line between the oil-fired Aguirre generating complex in Salinas and AES Corp’s ( AES.N ) coal-fired power plant in Guayama, PREPA said in a statement on Wednesday. PREPA estimated on Wednesday that it would take 24 to 36 hours to restore service to all customers that had power before Wednesday’s blackout. Before the outage, PREPA said 1.43 million homes and businesses had electric service. That is 97.2 percent of the utility's 1.47 million total customers. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2jYDF9s ) Many of the remaining 40,000 customers have been without power since Hurricane Maria. PREPA has suffered several blackouts since the storm, including an outage last week affecting about 870,000 customers, and has been in bankruptcy since July, owing some $9 billion to mutual funds, hedge funds and other investors.

Anthony J Nash,"Fortnite might look simple from an outside perspective, but the game is surprisingly complex, and there's a lot to keep track of. Unfortunately for fans, the in-game tracking system is pretty barebones, with players only able to see a few stats sprinkled across the current season. Luckily, several third-party tracking sites have begun tracking these kinds of complex stats, and in an effort to find which offers the most comprehensive view of things, we've taken a look at some of the best Fortnite tracking sites out there.
The Fortnite Tracker Network has a ton of customization options when it comes to what stats you want to view. You can look at things like your overall kill/death ratio, your stats across various seasons, and even how you're improving or declining over a specific period of time. It also offers a ""TRN rating,"" which is its own version of an ELO ranking that compares you to every other Fortnite player. Players can check how they rank through each match on the leaderboards and even go game-by-game if they want to break down their stats.

Storm Shield One also offers a variety of stats to look at but also offers up a much different UI and a generally different look. Players on Storm Shield One can also compare how they play against some of the world's best Fortnite players, like Ninja or Tfue. For the Save the World portion of Fortnite, this is likely the most comprehensive site out there, as it tracks nearly everything you do in the game mode. Storm Shield One also offers the ability to check out what's for sale in Fortnite's in-game shop, allowing you to see if you're missing out on anything without opening the game.

Fortnite Master started out as a buggy site but quickly grew to be one of the better tracking sites out there. Not only does Fortnite Master give you a detailed history of your play, but it also offers in-depth guides on challenges, as well as the ability to check out the site in a variety of languages.

Scott K. Johnson,"Enlarge / Hurricane Florence as captured from the International Space Station by astronaut Alex Gerst. reader comments 7 In the last few years, teams of scientists have developed a consistent protocol for rapidly analyzing the influence of climate change on extreme weather events. Within a week of the disaster, reports have been available to inform the conversation about whether we can expect more events like it in the future. But on Wednesday, we saw the first example of something new—an analysis published before the event even happened. A group led by Stony Brook University’s Kevin Reed ran a very simple computer model experiment on Hurricane Florence —which isn’t due to make landfall until Friday—and quickly released the top-line results. The rapid studies we’ve been seeing are done by examining the historical weather record to estimate how rare and extreme a given storm or heat event would be in that area of the globe. From there, climate model simulations are used to see if climate change is expected to change the frequency of that type of event. Future-casting In this case, there’s obviously no data available for a thing that hasn’t happened yet. Instead, the researchers focused on a much more limited question that is faster to answer: how does a warmer world change this storm? In the counterfactual world where global warming never happened, it’s impossible to say if Hurricane Florence would even have been born. Even small changes can have complex consequences on the atmosphere, such that events would play out completely differently. But that’s not the point. Since Hurricane Florence is occurring in this warmer world, we can simply examine the effect of warmer temperatures. To do this, the researchers took the current state of the world on Tuesday, dropped that into their model as a starting point, and pressed play to simulate ahead to Sunday. For a comparison simulation, they took those starting conditions and essentially subtracted out global warming. In this counterfactual world, the storm looks significantly different. Hurricanes are fueled by energy from the evaporation of warm seawater, so it’s no surprise that warmer sea surface temperatures should give the storm a boost. The size of the boost in this case is pretty remarkable, though. The model analysis showed the real-world Florence dumping 50 percent more rain near the coast than it would in a world without human-caused warming. Bigger and wetter The basic scaling of rainfall with the increased moisture available in a warmer atmosphere means you expect to see at least a six-percent increase. Studies have shown that add-on effects can put that number in the neighborhood of 15 percent for storms like hurricanes, and one study estimated a whopping 38 percent increase for Hurricane Harvey, for example. Still, 50 percent is even greater, and the team has not yet shown what factors caused such a large increase in the model simulation. The modeled hurricane clearly stays stronger when simulated under current-day conditions, but it’s also larger. The diameter of the storm is about 80 kilometers (50 miles) greater than in the cooler simulation, which would translate into higher storm surge flooding on the coast. Team member Michael Wehner told Ars that the team is working to repeat this analysis with updated observations as the storm barrels down on the Carolinas, so we'll get to see how similar the results are for each iteration. The researchers also plan to repeat their work after the storm and carefully compare with the “forecast” analyses. That will help show how useful this trial run of pre-storm analysis was. For their part, the group behind the within-one-week studies explained Thursday that they won’t be providing an analysis of Hurricane Florence in the near future (for reasons ranging from complex historical data to swamped workloads). But they did comment on these pre-storm results, writing, “More analyses are needed to assess the robustness of this quick analysis, although the basic result that global warming increases the precipitation is a very robust one supported by observations and modelling studies.”",Simple analysis suggests global warming boosts Florence’s rain by 50 percent.,2018-09-13T18:05:44Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",A quick simulation of Hurricane Florence done without climate change,https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/first-ever-pre-storm-study-looks-at-climate-change-and-hurricane-florence/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/florence_alex_gerst_nasa-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,storm complex,1

According to Boeing, that plant will be shut down on Tuesday to give its more than 6,000 employees a chance safely evacuate ahead of the storm. In a statement to Business Insider, the company declined to say when the plant will reopen and instead told us ""operations will resume when it is safe to do so.""

Andrew Freedman,"Arctic scientists are poring over data coming in from the vast, normally frozen region, after the North Pole's version of a heat wave swept across the area for the past week. Not only was the region near the North Pole the warmest it has been during the month of February since at least the 1950s, but one of the northernmost land-based weather stations, known as Cape Morris Jesup, exceeded the freezing mark on an unprecedented nine separate days during the month. On Feb. 25, that weather station remained above freezing for about 24 hours, which is virtually unheard of during February, when there is no sunlight reaching the ground there. Arctic sea ice in the Bering Sea and to the north of Greenland actually declined during February, a time when sea ice usually expands toward its seasonal maximum in early to mid-March. SEE ALSO: 'Beast from the East' brings snow to UK, mainland Europe along with frigid temperatures Scientists interviewed for this story say that the Arctic warming event, technically known as a warm air intrusion, may be a common feature of the Arctic climate, as comparatively mild and moist air from the midlatitudes is transported north by storm systems. However, this event was not like the others, researchers said. In Greenland, monitoring stations registered unprecedented warmth at the top of the world's largest island. The recent persistence and widespread coverage of above average temperatures in the #Arctic is particularly noteworthy to me. Map shows the air temperature departure (anomaly) so far this winter (to-date). pic.twitter.com/RgaA6i22NS — Zack Labe (@ZLabe) February 26, 2018 ""I think it's fair to say that this event is unprecedented in our record — both in terms of the magnitude and (for Kap Morris Jesup at least) the duration,"" said Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute, in a Twitter message, using the Danish spelling for Cape Morris Jessup. ""The warm event at KMJ is not record breaking in terms of the highest ever recorded temperature in February, but that event in 2011 was very short-lived compared to what we have seen this year...,"" she said. ""A prolonged period like this has definitely not been seen before."" She said some of the warmth in northern Greenland was likely due to downsloping winds known as Foehn winds, which can increase air temperatures. But that doesn't explain the warmth in the Arctic overall, when compared to average February conditions. ""But when we look at the high Arctic overall, the temperature record since 1958 has never seen a warm spike of this magnitude in February,"" she said. ""Having said that, the last few winters have seen similar events of very warm air coming in to the Arctic, though not nearly as large in magnitude,"" Mottram said. Temperature departures from average on Feb. 26, 2018, showing the red splotch of warmth across the Arctic. Image: climate reanalyzer. ""I'm pretty surprised by quite how large the temperature anomaly is this year and how persistent."" Noting cold temperatures on the west side of Greenland, Mottram emphasized that this was a weather event that was superimposed on top of rising average temperatures in the Arctic. The rising baseline makes it easier to attain all-time record highs, like a rising basketball floor making it more likely that a player will be able to dunk the ball in the net. A study published in 2017 found that these types of warming events have been increasing in frequency and duration during winter as the Arctic continues to warm at more than twice the rate of the rest of the globe. The northerly warm airflow opened up the sea ice north of Greenland. This large open water area is very unusual. I haven't seen a similar event like this before in the almost 25 years I now work with satellite data. pic.twitter.com/RJcONASaO4 — Lars Kaleschke (@seaice_de) February 26, 2018 ""What’s exactly driving these changes is not clear, but having storm tracks move further north (i.e. the North Atlantic storm track) may be tied to the northward retreat of the ice edge,"" said Julienne Stroeve, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, in an email. ""Thus, while having temperatures exceed freezing during winter is not uncommon, but it may be becoming more common as the climate changes and the ice edge continues to retreat."" Stroeve said that it's not just summer and fall sea ice showing steep declines, but that this is occurring year round now. ""What it shows us too is that the winter sea ice is now also starting to respond as every winter now for the past 4 winters has been more extreme than the year before in terms of record low sea ice,"" she said. The Arctic heat wave — though most wouldn't consider temperatures in the mid 30s to low 40s Fahrenheit to be ""hot,"" this the Arctic in the dead of winter — has its roots in a weather system that pumped mild and unusually moist air into the Arctic from the Atlantic, while another storm system did the same from the Pacific side of the Arctic. Winds blew from the southeast off the east coast of Greenland for the past week, driving this mild and moist air northward, toward the North Pole, where temperatures were about 45 degrees Fahrenheit higher than average for this time of year. The warm air intrusion followed two other related and noteworthy weather events, a sudden warming of the stratosphere, known as a sudden stratospheric warming event, and a splitting of the polar vortex. These are both complex phenomena, but a sudden stratospheric warming event typically occurs when energy from the lower atmosphere travels upwards, and this can disrupt the area of low pressure and high westerly winds that comprise the polar vortex. One area of the vortex wound up in the Western U.S., while the other went to Eurasia, where it's helping to cause an Arctic outbreak in Europe known as the ""Beast from the East."" The net result of these events was that the ultra-cold air typically found in the Arctic during February drained out of the region, as if someone opened the Northern Hemisphere's freezer door and left it ajar. Daily 2 meter surface air temperature for the Arctic averaged above 80°N. Individual years from 1958-2017 are shown by the sequential blue/purple to yellow lines. 2018 is indicated by the red line. The white line shows the average temperature. Image: zack labe Zack Labe, a climate scientist at the University of California at Irvine, has a knack for creating compelling visuals of Arctic sea ice trends and air temperatures. His data corroborate this narrative, and this analogy, showing a sharp and persistent spike in air temperatures during February to the north of 80 degrees North Latitude. ""The duration of this warmth is remarkable and a common feature of the last several winters,"" Labe said in a Twitter message. He said that while warm air intrusions occur every winter, this one is unusual for occurring during February, lasting longer than a week, and for ""the extent/magnitude of the moisture transport into the Arctic."" ""I think the takeaway is that the dramatic wintertime warming of the Arctic continues in addition to a long-term trend in decreasing sea ice. These effects, along with others, have significant physical, environmental, social, and political consequences for the Arctic and beyond,"" he said.","Arctic scientists are poring over data coming in from the vast, normally frozen region, after the North Pole's version of a heat wave swept across the area for the past week.

Ryan Truchelut,"WeatherTiger's Ryan Truchelut gives you all the information you need to stay warm and dry. Mixed and/or Frozen Precipitation Chances (Photo: National Weather Service) North Florida, this is happening. It’s been four years since the last significant frozen precipitation in the Big Bend and nearly three decades since the last measurable snowfall in Tallahassee in December 1989. But I can say with confidence that a messy mix of ice, sleet and snow will likely be outside your door Wednesday morning. Some are even calling this winter storm the Snolepocalypse. You may now rush to Publix to purchase your emergency French toast supplies of bread, milk and eggs. Looking at the meteorological set-up, the key pieces needed to square the circle of Florida snow have fallen into place in the last few days. First, a powerful Arctic high pressure system over the mid-South has brought in rare sub-freezing temperatures at the surface. Next, a tropical air mass remains lurking over the southern Gulf and Bahamas to provide moisture. Finally, a pair of upper-level disturbances, the matches for low-pressure development, are diving south out of the Plains. Minus the presence of the Val ""Iceman"" Kilmer himself, the pattern could not be more favorable. WINTER STORM WARNING: As uncertainty regarding these ingredients has decreased, both global and mesoscale weather models have converged on a solution in which Tallahassee is on the western edge of a zone of frozen precipitation that will extend west to between Lake City and Jacksonville. In Tallahassee, a wintry mix is likely to start after 3 a.m. and end before 11 a.m., and is likely to be formidable enough for a time to make driving dangerous. For this reason, the National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for Leon County and east effective through noon Wednesday. There are two major uncertainties to discuss. The first is precipitation amount. Model ensembles have trended higher over the last few days and are now in good agreement that Tallahassee will receive more than just a trace of frozen precipitation. While the most likely liquid-equivalent amount total is around 0.1"" (50 percent chance), Tallahassee sits on a sharp gradient in expected totals between very little precipitation to our west and 0.5"" or more toward Lake City.

(Photo: Hali Tauxe/Democrat) It is plausible but not likely that a small shift east would bring these heavier amounts into Tallahassee, dramatically upping our impacts (20 percent chance). Also possible — though not expected — is the scenario in which accumulating wintry precipitation stays just to our south and east (30 percent chance), and Tallahassee sees just a few stray flakes or sleet pings. The second uncertainty is precipitation type, which is notoriously difficult to forecast until a winter storm is under way. That's because a powerful storm like this one turns the atmosphere into a complex layer cake of above and below freezing levels, into which snowflakes aloft fall, melt, and potentially refreeze. Freezing rain occurs when a relatively thinner layer at the surface is below a melting band, while ice pellets occur when the surface cold layer is thicker. Based on current trends and short-range ensembles, I believe the most likely outcome in Tallahassee is for sleet to be dominant in the first half of the storm, with a change-over to some light snow in the latter half. A good rule of thumb in these kind of marginal winter events is that 0.1 inch of rain is the equivalent of around 0.75 inches of snow, so as indicated by the NWS, there is potential for up to 1 inch of snow accumulations should it be the dominant precipitation type. More likely, however, is a thin coating on grassy surfaces. Further east towards Lake City, freezing rain is likely to be more prominent in the wintry mix. Glaze is very destructive to trees and power lines, especially our sprawling oaks, so any trend further west with the track of the low is Tallahassee’s worst-case scenario. This would mean not only heavier overall accumulations, but a higher chance of ice damage and power outages. Overall, while precipitation type is the least confident part of the forecast, I do not see a trend towards heavier icing afoot. A final risk to keep in mind is that whatever ice or snow we see during the day is going to melt in the afternoon, with highs topping out around 40. Any ponding on roads will refreeze overnight as temperatures are expected to be below 32 for at least 10 hours, which means a possibility of black ice and unsafe travel conditions continuing into Thursday morning as well. All in all, let’s stay off the roads as much as humanly possible and just enjoy a nice cup of hot cocoa until the Snolepocalypse is over. It should go great with that French toast you made.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Marina Galperina to Gizmodo","I sat for a while trying to figure out what image should be at the top of this post. Punching in different keywordshurricane, wildfire, heat waveturned up photos from around the world. Eventually, I settled on Southern Californias Woolsey Fire bearing down on the mansions of Malibu, because it best encapsulates this moment in time. Its the perfect metaphor for 2018, the year when climate changes influence on our weather crystalized further, when it the flames showed up in our proverbial (and in some cases, literal) backyard. And the planet, our home, will go up in smoke if we dont act soon. It wasnt just fires either. Heat, winds, water, and other weather disasters created horrific damage all over. Here are all the ways the world burned in 2018, a catastrophe that will only get worse if we dont address climate change soon. Flames The Woolsey Fire was a $1.6-billion disaster that wouldve been the worst imaginable fire this year if not for what was happening in Northern California at the same time. The Camp Fire burned an entire town to the ground, left dozens dead, thousands without a home, and caused California to temporarily have the worst air quality on the planet. But Californias fire story doesnt even stop there. In August the Mendocino Complex became Californias largest in history, just a year after the Thomas Fire took the title. Oh, and of course there was the Carr Fire, which also cracked the list of most destructive fires in Californias history and spawned a massive firenado. And flames were hardly limited to California. British Columbia saw day turn into night thanks to wildfires. Sweden went up in smoke. So did Siberia. Even as winter has quashed the flames in the northern hemisphere, now its Australias turn to face unprecedented fire conditions. Heat You cant really have flames with heat. And in a warming world, theres heat in spades. This year will likely go down as the fourth-warmest on record for the globe. Next year could be even hotter. While only the Earth itself really experiences the global average temperature, the rest of us felt its rise in the form of heat waves. The aforementioned Scandinavian fires wouldve been impossible without record heat that seared the region this summer. In fact, much of Europe was gripped by heat, and weird things happened. The ice on top of Swedens tallest mountain shrunk so much, it lost the title of tallest mountain. Englands long-buried ancient villages emerged in the form of crop markings. Then there were the records. Temperatures rose above freezing at the worlds northernmost weather station in the dead of the dark, Arctic winter. Japan had its hottest day ever recorded. A heat wave led to the hottest day ever recorded in all of Africa. Pakistan saw the hottest April day ever recorded on Earth. Death Valley recorded the hottest month on Earth period. It was hot, yall. Waves, wind, and rain After 2017, you would think we could get a break with the hurricanes and typhoons and whatnot. But no. The U.S. saw record-setting Florence and Michael devastate North Carolina and Florida, respectively. Each storm is a multi-billion dollar disaster, marking a second straight year of multiple violent hurricanes hitting the U.S. A freak tropical storm also made landfall in the Great Lakes, because why not. Other cyclone basins also delivered punch after punch after punch. The eastern Pacific churned out multiple storms that underwent rapid intensification. In the central Pacific, Hurricane Lane brought torrential rain to Hawaii, while Walaka washed an entire island off the map. In the western Pacific, we saw a freaky annular typhoon with a huge eye as well as widespread destruction in the Marianas Islands thanks to Typhoon Yutu. The basin also spawned the strongest storm on Earth of 2018: Super Typhoon Mangkhut had winds reach 200 mph over the open ocean, though thankfully they quieted down by landfall. This list is hardly exhaustive, but then, wed be here for days if it were. The point is were seeing more catastrophic weather, climate change is in part behind it, and the time to address it is in short supply. The weather wont stop in 2019. There will be more records and losses and questions about how to rebuild or even if we should. But that doesnt mean were screwed. It means we need courage, and on that front there are some encouraging signs, including new members of Congress who actually get the monumental challenge we face and are willing to rise and meet it. Hopefully with their leadership, 2019 will look a little less bleak.","I sat for a while trying to figure out what image should be at the top of this post.

George Dvorsky,"As temperatures outside dipped to well below freezing, and as blizzards pounded the Antarctic research station, German scientists were carefully tending to a remarkable veggie garden—one requiring no soil or natural sunlight. The success of their first harvest, which produced vibrant-looking lettuce, radishes, cucumbers, and other treats, represents a promising test run for similar greenhouses that could one day be built on Mars—or beyond. It’s called the EDEN-ISS project, and it’s taking place at a greenhouse located a thousand feet from Neumeyer-Station III, a research base sponsored by the Alfred Wegener Institute, the German Aerospace Center (DLR), and other institutions. By growing vegetables in one of the most uncompromising environments on Earth, the scientists are hoping to replicate conditions found on the Moon, Mars, and other celestial bodies. Success here means future offworld colonists should be able to grow their own food, and not depend on complex and costly supply missions. With no soil or natural sunlight, the German scientists grew their crops using a closed water cycle and optimized levels of carbon dioxide and artificial lighting. After just three weeks, Paul Zabel, an Antarctic gardener (how cool a title is that?), collected eight pounds of lettuce, 18 cucumbers, and 70 radishes. And they looked amazing! Other crops included basil, parsley, chives, and coriander. A stubborn batch of strawberries is taking its sweet time; the researchers are still waiting for the first successful harvest of the tasty fruit, telling German newsite Deutsche Welle they just have to be “patient.” Meanwhile, the temperatures outside reached -4 degrees F (-20 degrees C). Zabel usually spends between three and four hours a day tending to his garden, and he’s had to deal with some adversity, including minor system failures and a powerful storm—the strongest to hit the region in more than a year. Zabel is one of 10 researchers currently posted at the remote Antarctic station. They eventually hope to produce nine to 11 pounds of fruits and vegetables per week, which could happen as early as this May. This achievement is a first for German scientists, but it’s not the first time that plants have been grown on the frozen continent. The McMurdo Station and Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station have hosted hydroponic greenhouse experiments before, with successful results. And NASA has even managed to grow some greens on the International Space Station. The difference here is that the German scientists are trying to produce a wider range of vegetables, and to set the groundwork for similar stations to be set up on the Moon or Mars. What’s more, the system could also be used on Earth in places where the climate is harsh or unpredictable. The scientists do not appear to have attempted to grow any greens of a... uh... recreational nature, but given the success of these crops, it seems it would be quite possible. The thought of having some sweet leaf, sitting back and admiring the red Martian landscape sounds perfectly out there.

Adam Rogers,"This past year, 2017, was the worst fire season in American history. Over 9.5 million acres burned across North America. Firefighting efforts cost $2 billion. This past year, 2017, was the seventh-worst Atlantic hurricane season on record and the worst since 2005. There were six major storms. Early estimates put the costs at more than $180 billion. As the preventable disease hepatitis A spread through homeless populations in California cities in 2017, 1 million Yemenis contracted cholera amid a famine. Diphtheria killed 21 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, on the run from a genocide. Disaster, Pestilence, War, and Famine are riding as horsemen of a particular apocalypse. In 2016, the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere reached 403 parts per million, higher than it has been since at least the last ice age. By the end of 2017, the United States was on track to have the most billion-dollar weather- and climate-related disasters since the government started counting in 1980. We did that. Transnational corporations and the most powerful militaries on Earth are already building to prepare for higher sea levels and more extreme weather. The FIRE complex—finance, insurance, and real estate—knows exactly what 2017 cost them ( natural and human-made disasters : $306 billion and 11,000 lives), and can calculate more of the same in 2018. They know that the radical alteration of Earth’s climate isn’t just something that’s going to happen in 100 years if we’re not careful, or in 50 years if we don’t change our economy and moonshot the crap out of science and technology. It’s here. Now. It happened. Look behind you. Let me rephrase: Absent any changes, by 2050 Earth will be a couple degrees hotter overall. Sea levels will be a foot higher. Now, 2050 seems as impossibly far away to me as 2017 did when I was 12 years old. I live in the future! And I like a lot of it. I like the magic glass slab in my pocket and the gene therapy and the robots. I mention this because in 2050, my oldest child will be the same age I am today, and I have given him a broken world. I don’t want that. So 2017 taught a lesson, at last, that scientists and futurists have been screaming about. Humanity has to reduce the amount of carbon it’s pumping into the air. Radically. Or every year will be worse from here on out. But 2017 also made plain the shape of the overall disaster. All those fires and floods and outbreaks are symptoms of the same problem, and it’s time to start dealing with that in a clear-eyed way. It’s also time to start building differently—to start making policies that understand that the American coastline is going to be redrawn by the sea, and that people can’t keep building single-family homes anywhere they can grade a flat pad. The wildland-urban interface can’t keep spreading at will. People can’t keep pumping fresh water out of aquifers without restoring them. Infrastructure for water and power has to be hardened against more frequent, more intense storms, backed up and reinforced so hundreds of thousands of people don’t go without electricity as they are in post-hurricane Puerto Rico. In short: Change, but also adapt. Fire season in the West is now a permanent condition; don’t build buildings that burn so easily in places that burn every year. Hurricanes and storm surges are going to continue to walk up the Caribbean and onto the Gulf Coast, or maybe along the seaboard. Don’t put houses on top of the wetlands that absorb those storms. Don’t insure the people who do. Build ways for people to get around without cars. Create a power grid that pulls everything it can from renewable sources like wind and solar. Keep funding public health research, surveillance, and ways to deal with mosquito-borne diseases that thrive in a hotter world. And the next time someone in a city planning meeting says that new housing shouldn’t get built in a residential area because it’s not in keeping with the sense of the community and might disrupt parking, tell them what that means: that they want young people to have lesser lives, that they don’t want poor people and people of color to have the same opportunities they did, and that they’d rather the planet’s environment get crushed by letting bad buildings spread to inhospitable places than increasing density in cities. This apocalypse doesn't hurt everyone. Some people benefit. It’s not a coincidence that the FIRE industries also donate the most money to federal political campaigns. Rich people living behind walls they think can’t be breached by any rising tide, literal or metaphoric, made this disaster. And then they gaslighted the vulnerable into distrusting anyone raising the alarm. The people who benefit have made it seem as if this dark timeline was all perfectly fine. It isn’t. And that’s why it’ll change. In 1957 Charles Fritz and Harry Williams, the research associate and technical director, respectively, of the National Academy of Sciences’ Disaster Studies Committee, wrote a paper that sparked the field of disaster sociology. Their findings were counterintuitive then, and somehow remain so. People in disasters, they said, don’t loot and riot. They help each other. “The net result of most disasters is a dramatic increase in social solidarity among the affected populace during the emergency and immediate post-emergency periods,” they wrote. “The sharing of a common threat to survival and the common suffering produced by the disaster tend to produce a breakdown of pre-existing social distinctions and a great outpouring of love, generosity, and altruism.” In a disaster, we help each other. The trick is recognizing the disaster. Through that lens, fixing the problem and protecting one another against its consequences isn’t merely inarguable. It’s human nature. We’re all in this together.","The past year was one of the worst on record for natural disasters.

Merrit Kennedy,"The active part of the landfill in Toa Baja is currently a hot, rancid, open dump. Federal regulations require trash piles to be covered daily with earth. But the site's supervisor says that's currently impossible. José Jiménez-Tirado for NPR Outside Puerto Rico's capital, a three-story-high mountain of debris and waste sits smack in the middle of what was a suburban soccer field before Hurricane Maria devastated the island. Blue bleachers peek out from the edge of the trash pile, as a line of trucks rolls in to dump even more tree branches and moldy furniture. Workmen wearing yellow hard hats operate diggers to add the new waste to the growing pile in the center of the field. Puerto Rico is struggling under the weight of its own garbage. Even before Maria hit two and a half months ago, the Environmental Protection Agency says most of the island's landfills were filled beyond capacity and that nearly half were under orders to close. Puerto Rico's Solid Waste Authority estimates that the powerful hurricane created 6.2 million cubic yards of waste and debris — and it needs to go somewhere. That's enough trash to fill about 43 football stadiums with piles of waste eights stories high, according to a measure used by FEMA. And it has to go somewhere. Workmen at the soccer field say the site became a makeshift dump because the landfill for the Toa Baja municipality, near San Juan, is so flooded with trash that wait times can be hours. When the soccer site becomes too full, the workers say waste is then moved to the landfill in dump trucks. In Maria's wake, local governments are supposed to separate tree branches and other ""green waste"" for composting so that it doesn't clog up landfills, says Antonio Rios, the head of Puerto Rico's Solid Waste Management Authority, the agency that sets the U.S. territory's waste policy. That composting process isn't happening everywhere, Rios acknowledges. Green debris is still winding up in overflowing landfills across the island, though he says authorities are trying to divert additional material to landfills that have more room. Rios points out that the hurricane has created other types of waste, things like broken kitchen appliances and food that went rotten because of a lack of electricity. The landfill in Toa Baja is managed by the private firm Conwaste and takes in trash from at least four municipalities. It has been deeply troubled for years. The site is supervised by 25-year-old Lionel Ruiz. Last month, he says, they accepted 36,000 tons of waste — that's 70 percent more than the month before the hurricane. Ruiz points to trash-filled trucks waiting in a line that stretches down a dirt road and off into the distance. ""It's more busy than usual,"" Ruiz says. ""You see the line? We never have that line in normal operation."" In 2008, the EPA ordered the Toa Baja landfill to close by 2014 because it posed an ""imminent and substantial endangerment to health and the environment."" Heaps of tree branches, moldy furniture and other debris from Hurricane Maria piles up at a former soccer field now being used as a dumping site in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico. Most of the island's landfills were already over capacity before the storm devastated the island in September. José Jiménez-Tirado for NPR The EPA said environmental inspectors found evidence that the landfill did not have a system to control liquid seeping through the garbage pile and into the ground. The agency found that this substance, called leachate, could potentially contaminate a nearby aquifer and wetlands. In 2012, the EPA allowed the landfill to push back the closure for an unspecified amount of time. The landfill was allowed to create a new, smaller area that used more environmental precautions — such as a lining to prevent seepage — and start accepting waste there. The story is much the same across the lush tropical island of Puerto Rico. The EPA got directly involved in the island's landfills in 2002, and has since ordered at least 12 of the approximately 29 landfills to close, which can be a years-long process. It's not immediately clear how many sites — most of which are already at capacity — have actually shut down. Rios of the Solid Waste Authority estimates that at current recycling rates, all of the island's landfills will be full in 20 to 25 years. Even the newly added space in Toa Baja's landfill is rapidly filling up, Ruiz says. Before the hurricane hit, he said he thought it would take five years for that area to fill up; Maria has sped up the timeline. He's grappling with immediate problems. Birds and insects circle around what is currently a hot, rancid, open dump. ""This is the active area of the landfill, you will see a lot of uncovered material,"" Ruiz says. Workers would normally cover the expansive mess with earth every day to comply with federal regulations, but he says they haven't been able to do so for a week because the private trucks they use are now being used by FEMA. The uncovered mounds of rotting garbage is upsetting to people down the hill in the neighborhood of Candelaria, people like 83-year-old Angelo Fernandez. ""The smell, the stink!"" he says, totally exasperated. ""Every time they leave it open, the smell is awful."" In his 41 years living here, he's seen mountains of trash rise from the ground, parts of which are now covered with dirt and vegetation. But the waste lies just inches under the surface. ""It is getting bigger, it is getting bigger and bigger — that was never this height — never,"" Fernandez says. ""All that mountain you see there is garbage!"" He says people living in Candelaria suffer from asthma and other breathing problems because of the landfill. They cough a lot. Actually closing a landfill is expensive, costing approximately $200,000 per acre, according to Rios. Puerto Rico is struggling with more than $120 billion in debt and pension obligations, and has filed for a bankruptcy-like procedure — and that was before the hurricane. The EPA has acknowledged that the budget crisis is making it more difficult for local governments on the island to handle the garbage problem. The municipalities ""have always had limited funds to implement the environmental and engineering controls required to improve, and ultimately close, the landfills,"" the agency says. And Puerto Rico's Environmental Quality Board hasn't required municipalities to set money aside in case their landfills needed to close. Another issue, Rios says, is that some of the landfills now under closure orders aren't charging garbage trucks high enough fees to generate the money to actually shut down. Ultimately, the troubled landfill system is ""a public health issue and it's about to collapse really soon,"" says Agustin Carbo, former head of the Solid Waste Authority. He says Puerto Rico also needs to think beyond landfills rather than just open new ones. Recycling rates on the island are about half of what they are on the U.S. mainland. ""We need to look for different alternatives,"" he says, particularly because Puerto Rico has limited space. That might include a number of other waste management techniques such as ""waste-to-energy,"" which uses methods like incineration to produce electricity and heat. Most importantly, he says, ""people need to change their behavior and it's quite complex, how you change that in a small island. But it can be done — it just, people need to understand what's at stake here."" Those stakes are clear to Fernandez, who lives next to the landfill. He says that if it closed for good, ""I think it would be a better place to live. I know it would be.""","Even before Maria hit, most of the island's landfills were filled beyond capacity and nearly half had EPA closure orders.

Luke Plunkett,"For Civ fans, the future has been set in stone since October 2016: no matter how good Civilization VI was at launch, it wouldnt be done until it had gotten two expansions. Well, now its got them.
Building on the content introduced in 2018's Rise &amp; Fall, and adding a whole raft of its own new features, Gathering Storm radically transforms the way Civilization VI plays, going well beyond the usual add new leaders and menus routine by shaping the way the world itself behaves around you.
For the last couple of years, even after Rise &amp; Falls release, Civilization VI has existed in a weird place. Its a very good game, but also rarely feels like it has excited the series fanbase like 2010's Civ V. There are probably a number of reasons for this; Civilization V is still fantastic (and even looks great despite its age), and its matured scalewith both its expansions already out and settled inmakes it seem more fully-featured.
We might also just be hitting a point in the life of this series where a new Civilization is like a new iPhone, an exercise in pleasing but diminishing returns. There are only so many of these games people can play in their lives before the fundamental building blocks of their design start to blur into each other.
Thats my generalising guess, anyway, and I think its a bit unfair on Civilization VI, which has tried harder than most other games in the long-running series to differentiate itself from its predecessors. I remarked at launch that it felt much more board-gamey than other Civ titles, which has always been the latest games strongest point, and Im glad that its being leaned on so heavily in Gathering Storm.
My favourite thing about Civilization VI has always been how physical it is. Because its districts spread out from your cities across the map, and your precious builders are so powerful with their terrain-shifting abilities, Civilization VIs world has always felt incredibly tactile, as much a plaything as the games units and menus.
The main focus of Gathering Storm, as you might have guessed from the name, is on this world. Only now were exposed to its perils. No longer is a map simply a blank canvas, waiting for the player to fill it up with cities and farms. Its now a living place, one that is heaving and resisting human occupation at every turn.
Maps are now littered with hazards. There are volcanoes that erupt, rivers that flood, droughts that ravage crops, blizzards sweeping over polar regions, hurricanes swirling across the seas and tornadoes roaming the plains, all designed to remind the player that the planet is an immovable, immortal force shaping your games, and that it is constantly going to wreck your shit.
On the bright side, its not like these effects are entirely random. This is a millennia-spanning strategy game, not a SimCity map. Most of Gathering Storms fury is tied to its geography; of course a river floods, thats what rivers do, and if you want to settle next to a volcano then dont go crying to Sid Meier when fire and brimstone rains down on your city every thousand years or so.
Natures wrath keeps you on your toes (you can reduce the intensity of disasters if you like, or even turn them off), and youll even need to clean up after the damage left by most events, but its not all bad news. Theres risk v reward at play, because volcanic eruptions might destroy a district, but the ash left behind makes for amazingly fertile farming ground, so theres definitely incentive (or at least compensation) if youre forced to build a civilization in dangerous territory.
You spend most of a Gathering Storm game as the victim, helplessly watching on as the planet lashes out at your cities but towards the end of a game, as you reach the industrial era and beyond, the tables have turned and its you who is hurting the planet. This expansion goes big on mans environmental impact on the Earth, tracking everything from temperature increases to sea level rises, even finding a very Civ-like way to turn it into a competition, with each sides contribution to CO2 levels compared.
This all has a massive impact on your game, far beyond existing as numbers in a menu screen. As temperatures and sea levels rise, destructive storms become more frequent, while the rising sea itself is even more important, as it slowly floods the maps coastal areas, trashing improvements and districts and creating housing shortages as your citizens flee inland.
At times it can be confronting, and even depressing to play through the later stages of a game in Gathering Storm. Civilization games have always felt a bit frantic and finite as you approach the modern era, like a giant doomsday clock is ticking down in the skies above you, but to now see the world eroding at its fringes as you do so makes it so much worse.
Though I do appreciate the added busywork this provides. I tend to pursue science victories in Civ, which unless the shit is really going down usually involves barricading my borders with fortresses and clicking next turn until my spaceship launches. Its usually a boring way to end things, but having to manage the end of the world (and its associated cleanup and civil works responsibilities) at the same time made for an interesting challenge.
Weirdly, theres also some psychological relief to be found in taking direct action against climate change, instead of just reading depressing tweets all day and resigning yourself to the impending death of all insects and essential crops. In Gathering Storm climate change is something you can proactively fight, as youre able to build coastal flood barriers and switch an entire Civilization to clean and renewable sources of energy, so its great that the game can make me feel empowered about the process, even if the sensation is fleeting and artificial.
I dont mention renewable energy in passing, because power is now very much a thing in Civilization VI. Cities with industrial intentions can no longer just churn out tanks for free, they need to be powered in order to run at their optimal output. At first you can only do this with coal and oil, which of course plays a huge role in melting ice caps, so later on in the game its very much worth the extra time to build stuff like solar farms and hydro plants.
Keeping the lights on across a Civilization can be a bit of a hassle, straying into the realms of micromanagement when this is a series that works best with broader brushstrokes, but its worth it for the granular control it encourages over your environmental decisions.
That resource management extends to introducing supply requirements for the upkeep of unitsfighters need aluminium, tanks need oilwithout which theyre severely underpowered. Strategic resources themselves are now also commodified; no longer listed as abstract sources, theres now an actual numerical value applied to how much of it youve got, so you can trade stockpiles of iron for coal, and check at a glance whether youve got enough oil to power your units and cities.
Less successful is the expansions other big introduction, or technically reintroduction. Civilization Vs World Congress makes a long-awaited return, only its now nowhere near as cool.
Where in Civ V it was a powerful tool, able to quickly and drastically shape world affairs with tools like trade embargoes, now players are continually being asked to vote on inane, randomly-generated issues like whether duplicates of a luxury resource should provide a boost, or whether a single players trade routes should be worth a few extra gold coins. 
I found very quickly that Id rather be clicking straight through most proposals as they werent worth my time, but you have to vote on every single issue, which sucks. Im the immortal leader of a world superpower, surely somebody else can handle backwoods trade negotiations!
Returning alongside the congress itself is the ability to win a diplomatic victory, though this has undergone a few important changes. Diplomatic wins are now earned by collecting votes at the World Congress, which can be bought/influenced by spending a new resource for Gathering Storm, called diplomatic favour. You can also spend favour in trade negotiations, and can earn/lose it with war declarations. 
Its a new way to win, and I like how this new system encourages more wheeling and dealing behind the scenes to gather more favour, but diplomatic wins can still feel cheap and sudden, particularly since its so easy to game the AI into trading diplomatic favour with you.
A final addition worth mentioning is that to go with the increased busywork of cleaning up/protecting your cities from climate disaster, the endgame has also been beefed up with additional tech and civics. Theres a whole extra era of near-future government types, advanced aquatic builder improvements like seasteads (think BioShock) and offshore wind turbines, and even the return of the Giant Death Robot, which can be upgraded through future tech research and which is wonderfully overpowered.
Whats new in this expansion is of course super important, but its also worth pointing out what hasnt changed. The continued failure of the AI to present coherent diplomatic positions, reactions that make the barest of sense and implausible trade suggestions continue to plague Civilization VI. Anyone hoping for a magical fix in this department will be disappointed.
Which is sad, because a big part of what makes this series special is its character. Ive criticised other 4X games for lacking Civs heart, since the feeling that youre dealing with actual characters can really help elevate the experience, but in Civ VIs case the spirit of your artificial opponents has never matched the quality of the animation and voice acting.
What theyre lacking in brainpower is at least partly made up for by the nuts and bolts of Gathering Storms new characters. Some are just rearrangements of existing ideas given pretty faces, but others arrive loaded with genuinely intriguing new possibilities. The Maori begin every game at sea, for example (borrowing one of Colonizations greatest tricks) and earn bonuses in the turns it takes them to establish a capital, while Eleanor of Aquitaine is available across two factions, able to lead either England or Spain.
Like I mentioned up top, the long-held view by many fans, born not just of their experiences with Civilization V but of Paradoxs titles as well, was that at launch Civilization VI was a raw and unfinished thing, whose true power and focus would only be revealed after a couple of expansions. This line of thought held that at launch Civ V was a hexagonal travesty, for example, but after two expansions its now considered an all-time classic
I think this view is unfair, and maybe even a little bit self-destructive. Thats not how games work, and to hold every big strategy release to that standard is unrealistic. Civilization VI was a great game at launch, and an even better one after Rise &amp; Fall.
Its now better still.

LIKED
The series has been crying out for the return of environmental effects, and their implementation here is almost perfect.
DISLIKED
There's a bunch of stuff that seems to have been added for the sake of adding more stuff, not because it makes the game any deeper or more enjoyable.

PLAYED
Around 80 hours at Prince and King difficulty as the Maori, Canada, England, Korea and Norway. Completed science, conquest, cultural and diplomatic victories.
I call these expectations destructive though because it feels like Gathering Storm, in its attempt to add so much to Civilization VI, has maybe added too much. At any given moment theres now so much to keep track of, from trade routes to spy networks, strategic stockpiles to science gains, climate status to diplomatic relations, city loyalty to religious affairs. Its a heavy load, and Civ VIand its interfaceis creaking under the strain of it.
I look over everything added in this expansion and aside from the environmental and climate system, few of the additions really made a dent in my enjoyment of the game. The World Congress revival is a bust, and the game would have survived easily without it. And its odd seeing so many new things added to the game, to the point where even a casual small-map playthrough requires loads of menu gazing, when fixing (or at least doing a better job of obscuring) the poor AI would have been a more welcome change.
The very heart of Civilization VIs original premise, with its emphasis on shaping the world and expanding your citys footprints across it via districts was fantastic, and Id have loved to see that honed and refined furtherlike the climate systems and late-game improvements haverather than simply seeing more complex systems piled atop of it.
This is why I love the environment impact and disasters in Gathering Storm so much. They really play to Civ VIs strengths directly; this is a game all about building, but floods and rising sea levels are a direct and elegant means of challenging this in an exciting new way.
Yes, its a shame Gathering Storms other introductions couldnt have the same impact, and that some will no doubt be disappointed that this second expansion couldnt put a bow on the Civ VI experience like Civ V enjoyed with Brave New World.
Yet even taking its whiffs and missed opportunities into account, Ive still loved every hour Ive spent with Gathering Storm. Its an expansion that may not stick its landing, but which should still be applauded and admired for the way it sets out to change the very world we play on, and succeeds.","For Civ fans, the future has been set in stone since October 2016: no matter how good Civilization VI was at launch, it wouldn’t be done until it had gotten two expansions.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Super typhoon reaches the Philippines At least two people have died after a massive storm brought destruction to the northern Philippines. Typhoon Mangkhut ripped through the Philippines' main island of Luzon, and is now moving west towards China. Almost all buildings in the city of Tuguegarao sustained some damage, a government official said, and communications were down in places. More than four million people were in the path of the storm, which packed winds of 185km/h (115mph). Thousands were evacuated amid warnings of 6m (20ft) storm surges. In the first confirmed deaths, police found the bodies of two women killed in a landslide in the city of Bangio. Officials say the death toll will rise. The deadliest storm on record in the Philippines was Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which killed more than 7,000. What is the latest? The typhoon made landfall at Baggao, in the north-east of the Philippines, at about 01:40 local time on Saturday (17:40 GMT on Friday). After losing some of its wind speed over land, it was downgraded from a super typhoon and is now travelling with wind speeds equivalent to a category four hurricane. Image copyright AFP Image caption Typhoon Mangkhut has caused widespread damage Image copyright AFP Image caption The powerful storm was felt in the Philippine capital Manila The storm - known locally as Ompong - has a cloud diameter of about 900km and is heading west at about 30km/h. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) billed the storm as the strongest tropical cyclone the world has faced so far this year. The Philippine Red Cross shared footage of rising flood waters and winds ripping through towns on Saturday morning. Image copyright AFP Image caption Flooding and landslides are expected Image copyright AFP Image caption Authorities though say preparations are better than in previous years The typhoon is forecast to pass near Hong Kong on Sunday afternoon. Authorities there have urged residents to stay indoors when the storm approaches. Weather experts say it may be the strongest tropical storm to hit the territory in decades. In nearby Macau, shops have been boarded up and residents have been sticking tape on their windows. The typhoon is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday. How prepared is the Philippines? Authorities in the Philippines have said they were better prepared for the storm than in previous years. Warnings have been issued in dozens of provinces. Travel by sea and air has been restricted. Flights have been cancelled, schools shut and the army is on standby. Media caption People in Aparri tied down their roofs ahead of Typhoon Mangkhut The authorities have also warned that heavy rains could trigger landslides and flash floods. ""We are really frightened,"" Delaila Pasion, who had fled her home, told AFP news agency. ""They say it is so strong, we were too scared to remain."" ""During previous monsoon rains, half of our house was destroyed so I wanted to take my grandchildren to safety,"" she told journalists. Image copyright AFP Image caption Officials are preparing food and supplies for affected residents The Philippines is routinely hit during the typhoon season. In China, where the storm is predicted to hit late on Sunday or early on Monday, the authorities have raised storm alerts to ""yellow"", which is the second level on the four-tier warning system. High-speed rail services have been cancelled in parts of the south, local media report. Hong Kong battens down By Robin Brant, BBC News China correspondent Tape has been stuck to the windows; ominous Xs can be seen on the inside of homes and offices, and some bamboo scaffolding appears to have been taken down or secured as a precaution. Passengers planning to fly out of Hong Kong's international airport on Sunday have been warned to expect ""severe disruption"". Officials have asked people to stay indoors and - to the few who may be thinking about it - not to go out surfing or storm chasing. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Businesses in Hong Kong have begun to prepare for the incoming storm This is a place used to preparing for approaching storms but they know this one is big. Mangkhut may be classed as a super typhoon, again, by the time it passes, or hits, Hong Kong at some time on Sunday. At its current rate, forecasters say it could be the strongest typhoon they've seen since they started making records in the 1940s. Is global warming to blame? The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these rare events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data. Are you in the area? How are you preparing for the typhoon?

John Biggs,"Lego – or LEGO – is expensive and kids – my kids in particular – want a lot of it. Our basement looks like the returns department of a major toy store, covered from corner to corner with toys and, most notably, and endless minefield of little building blocks. And we enjoy building models and imaginative play and my youngest child, Guthrie, loves Star Wars. But all that quality plastic is expensive and the Star Wars kits are the most expensive of all. What are we to do? Add his favorites to holiday gift registries so his grandparents can buy it for him? Spend hundreds of dollars on ships that crash and leave a field of debris and minifigs for miles? Or do we turn to the Internet, that fount of all solace, and find Lepin. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there were Lego knock-offs. The most popular come from a company called Lepin which I first learned about from this surprisingly complete review of the First Order Tie Fighter set. This video, which features a surprisingly thorough look at Lego vs. Lepin, was a family favorite for a while, taking precedence over the Star Wars trailers and Bad Lip Reading my kids usually watched. They were mesmerized by the slow and steady pace of the video and I was mesmerized by the thought that I could save some money on my Lego. Before you get excited about the morality or legality of these knock offs understand that I well know that Lego deserves every penny they get. After building the Lepin set I began to better understand the care that goes into a good Lego set and the satisfaction of having a product that doesn’t fall apart mid-flight. That said, this was an experiment and it was truly to surprising to see such a complete and blatant copy of Lego’s kit come in a plain brown paper sack. Unlike other knock-offs I’ve seen – swap meet Louis and fake Rolexes, for example – the Lepin kit was a one-to-one copy of the original, albeit with a few major issues. So I hit Alibaba and bought the Tie Fighter kit, a model that at once pushed all the right nostalgia buttons for me and the excitement buttons for my children and was sufficiently complex and expensive that we didn’t want to order the real model. I would build this Tie Fighter… for science. The kit cost $48 with $12 shipping and arrived in two weeks. It came in a plain brown padded envelope with an instruction manual and little bags of pieces. The Lepin pieces aren’t organized in any discernible way although some of the larger pieces are stuck together in the same bag while smaller pieces are crammed inside multiple smaller bags. There is no bag order and the manual does not expect you to open any bag first. Basically your best bet is to dump out all the pieces and get building. The first thing you’ll notice is that the pegs are completely smooth with a few indented where the injection mold went in. These blocks have no Lego branding and are instead disturbingly bare, as if someone had sandblasted away the logos on a real kit. The minifigs are also problematic. The faces and painting aren’t quite as crisp as Lego’s and the accessories – in this case a little hose connecting to the pilot’s helmet – was oddly connected to the helmet itself, a cost-saving measure that looks like it could snap off and get lost fairly easily. Once you’ve organized your pieces you can begin assembling the kit. This is when you meet another cost-saving measure. The manual shows only the piece you just assembled in color. The rest of the pieces are greyed out. This means you don’t know what the kit is supposed to look like as it’s being built which makes it especially hard to assemble the internals. Further, the entire manual is chock full of steps. While the Lego kit paces you through each step, placing one or two steps on the page, this manual is chock full of them. It’s very easy to get lost. We built this model in two days. My son was able to build quite a bit of it but I stepped in at the end because I liked the challenge and he got bored. Soon we discovered the fatal flaw in the Lepin system: the models don’t stick together. My wife’s father used to make injection molded toys. He always speaks reverentially of Lego, repeating to us over and over that the company repeatedly destroys is plastic molds to make new ones, thereby ensuring that each piece is crisp, clean, and straight. The molds, you see, are the most expensive part of the process, costing tens of thousands of dollars to manufacture. To create new molds for something as complex as this is wildly costly but, as far as plastics lore goes, Lego is more than willing to spend that cash. Lepin isn’t. As you begin building you’ll find that some of the straight pieces curl up. The hinges don’t quite stick together. The big boards don’t quite match. As you build you find yourself wondering if the whole thing will hold and, in the end, it won’t. For example, this model uses four little U clamps that stick out on each side to connect to four bars embedded into the wings. These U clamps sometimes seem to click into place but when they don’t the wings fall off and break, requiring another ten minutes of rebuilding. These are not built for rough play – or any play at all – because even the hatch into which you slide your pilots will fall off if you close the door all the way. The tolerances – those sweet, Danish, Lego tolerances – are gone here, leaving behind something that is best displayed on a shelf. If you or your kid are fine with having knock-off Lego on a high shelf where no one can get a better look at it then by all means pick up a model or two. But understand you will be disappointed. While this is a near exact clone of the original kit, the little differences add up to a mess. This Tie Fighter is currently next to our hermit crab cage, untouched, while Poe Dameron’s X-Wing is regularly strafing Storm Troopers and the rest of the Lego is being repurposed into bases, houses, and Minecraft adventures. The only toy that isn’t being played with is the Lepin kit. That says a lot. Sure you can save money, but should you? Lego shouldn’t cost so much and our kids shouldn’t want so much of it but, in the end, aren’t we teaching them the value of tactile play, the power of building out of constituent parts. Further, I won’t begrudge a kid who wants to play with Lego the ability to build their own Tie Fighter if this is all they can afford. But, in the end, Lego wins in a head-to-head, minifig claws down. Should you buy Lepin? The stalwart brand defender in me says no. However, if you’re looking to save a buck and want to give your kids the joy of building a knock-off – but not the joys of playing with it – then you can probably get away with this little bit of C-3PFaux. May the Force, as they say, be ever in your favor.

The Conversation,"When those first fat drops of summer rain fall to the hot, dry ground, have you ever noticed a distinctive odor? I have childhood memories of family members who were farmers describing how they could always ""smell rain"" right before a storm. Of course rain itself has no scent. But moments before a rain event, an ""earthy"" smell known as petrichor does permeate the air. People call it musky, fresh — generally pleasant. This smell actually comes from the moistening of the ground. Australian scientists first documented the process of petrichor formation in 1964 and scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology further studied the mechanics of the process in the 2010s. Petrichor is a combination of fragrant chemical compounds. Some are from oils made by plants. The main contributor to petrichor are actinobacteria. These tiny microorganisms can be found in rural and urban areas as well as in marine environments. They decompose dead or decaying organic matter into simple chemical compounds which can then become nutrients for developing plants and other organisms. A byproduct of their activity is an organic compound called geosmin which contributes to the petrichor scent. Geosmin is a type of alcohol, like rubbing alcohol. Alcohol molecules tend to have a strong scent, but the complex chemical structure of geosmin makes it especially noticeable to people even at extremely low levels. Our noses can detect just a few parts of geosmin per trillion of air molecules. Elisa Galceran Garcia/Shutterstock During a prolonged period of dryness when it has not rained for several days, the decomposition activity rate of the actinobacteria slows down. Just before a rain event, the air becomes more humid and the ground begins to moisten. This process helps to speed up the activity of the actinobacteria and more geosmin is formed. When raindrops fall on the ground, especially porous surfaces such as loose soil or rough concrete, they will splatter and eject tiny particles called aerosols. The geosmin and other petrichor compounds that may be present on the ground or dissolved within the raindrop are released in aerosol form and carried by the wind to surrounding areas. If the rainfall is heavy enough, the petrichor scent can travel rapidly downwind and alert people that rain is soon on the way. The scent eventually goes away after the storm has passed and the ground begins to dry. This leaves the actinobacteria lying in wait — ready to help us know when it might rain again.","Shutterstock/YuliiaKas Moments before a rain event, an ""earthy"" smell known as petrichor permeates the air — even though rain itself has no scent.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Six large new wildfires have erupted in the United States that pushed the number of major active blazes nationwide to over 100, with more expected to break out over the weekend sparked by lightning strikes on bone-dry terrain, authorities said on Saturday. More than 30,000 personnel, including firefighters from across the United States and nearly 140 from Australia and New Zealand, were battling the blazes that have consumed more than 1.6 million acres (648,000 hectares), according to the National Interagency Coordination Center. “We are expecting that there will be more fire-starts today,” Jeremy Grams, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, said in an interview on Saturday. He said dry thunderstorms, which produce lightning but little rain, are expected for parts of the Rocky Mountain region, while the U.S. northwest has critical fire weather conditions that include strong winds and low relative humidity. Firefighters were battling another day of extremely hot temperatures and strong winds on Saturday, the National Interagency Coordination Center said. The fires have scorched states from Washington to New Mexico, with California among the hardest hit. A mechanic helping to fight the Carr Fire near Redding in northern California was killed in a car crash on Thursday, the eighth person to die in that conflagration. The 181,000-acre (73,250-hectare) Carr Fire has destroyed nearly 1,100 homes. About 100 miles (160 km) southwest of the Carr Fire, about 3,500 firefighters are battling the Mendocino Complex Fire, which has burned 325,226 acres (131,614 hectares) as of Saturday and was the largest fire on record in California.

"https://www.facebook.com/luz.lazo.14, https://www.facebook.com/emily.wax.7, https://www.facebook.com/kevinsullivanpost","SPRINGFIELD, Fla. Entire oceanfront communities in the Florida Panhandle were virtually obliterated, an Air Force base suffered catastrophic damage and at least six people were killed by Hurricane Michael, a sucker-punch of a storm that intensified suddenly and now ranks as one of the four most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the United States. This one just looks like a bomb dropped, said Clyde Cain, who is with the Louisiana Cajun Navy, a group of volunteer search-and-rescue teams that went to Florida to help in Michaels wake, just as they did last month during Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas. Michael was downgraded to a tropical storm Thursday as it sped its way northeast through Georgia and the Carolinas on a path out into the Atlantic Ocean. But its relatively short assault on Floridas Gulf Coast was devastating. Tiny Mexico Beach, Fla., a town of about 1,000 residents, appeared to be have been almost destroyed by Michaels 155 mph impact just 1 mph short of a Category 5 storm. Aerial footage showed much of the seaside enclave reduced to kindling, trees sheared off just above the ground, tangles of power lines strewn in the streets and cars and boats piled up like rubbish. Entire blocks seemed essentially empty, with houses and everything else that had been on them smashed by storm surge and wind and presumably washed out to sea. This is not stuff that you just put back together overnight, said William Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Curtis Locus, a Florida Department of Transportation worker, said the damage he has seen across the Panhandle is unprecedented. This was a community in the middle of the forest. Now the forest is gone, and so is the community, Locus said. Its a beautiful place.... This is Party Town, USA. Now its Devastated Town, USA. Everything along the coastline was devastated like a war zone. Here in Springfield and nearby Panama City, apartment buildings are roofless, gas station awnings are twisted beyond recognition, businesses collapsed, metal posts as thick as tree trucks were folded in half, and billboards were blown onto homes or crushed cars. We didnt figure it was going to be this bad, said Mike Davis, 56, sitting on the sidewalk outside Oasis Liquor, a store on Panama Citys 15th Street, staring dully at the debris around him. This is devastating. Davis lives two blocks away and rode out the storm with his family. He decided to stay because he didnt think the storm would be very bad. When he woke Tuesday and heard that Michael had intensified, it was too late to leave. Michael was as powerful as it was unexpected, careening across the Gulf of Mexico and intensifying rapidly into a powerhouse. The night before the hurricane hit, police told Georgia Wells, 35, that she and her family were in a safe zone here in Springfield in a public housing complex. By Wednesday afternoon, shortly before landfall, it was clear they were in terrible danger. Her six children, mother and brother gathered in smallest bedroom of their apartment. As the winds howled and shrieked Wells said it sounded more like a tornado than a hurricane the drywall began to tear apart, the roof started to collapse and water flooded in. They ran for cover in a bathroom. The apartment was destroyed. We all thought we were going to die; thats how bad it was, she said. Wells, a single mother who works as a manager at a local McDonalds, lost most of her belongings. Families that live in the complex slept in cars and on benches Wednesday night and were planning to do the same Thursday. Everyone in this place has nowhere to go. Were stuck, Wells said. We dont have money to go anywhere. Just west of here, Panama City Beach, a resort area popular with retirees and spring-breakers, also was nearly wiped away by the wind and walls of water, with guardrails and roofs twisted into ribbons. The storm toppled 30-ton train cars. Michael also pummeled Tyndall Air Force base, set directly on the shoreline between Panama City and Mexico Beach, causing widespread roof damage to nearly every home and leaving the base closed until further notice, officials said in a statement. The bases 600 families had been evacuated Monday, and many were taken to shelters to ride out the storm. No injuries had been reported there as of late Thursday. Aerial footage showed buildings destroyed and a parking lot looking like a salvage yard filled with overturned RVs and trucks. A display of an F-15 fighter jet at the base entrance was torn from its base and flipped upside down. Rescuers continued to search for survivors and victims of the storm on Thursday as authorities warned that the death toll could rise. In Gadsden County in northwest Florida, not far from Tallahassee, which took a direct shot from Michael, the sheriffs office reported four deaths related to the storm. It released details of only one: a man who was killed when a tree crashed through the roof of his home. A 38-year-old man was killed Thursday afternoon in North Carolinas Iredell County, north of Charlotte, when a tree fell on the vehicle he was driving, according to David Souther, the countys fire marshal. Officials in Seminole County, Ga., north of the Florida border, said early Thursday that an 11-year-old girl in a mobile home was killed by a metal carport that was thrown into the air by Michaels gusting winds. Michaels immense devastation made it difficult for rescuers to reach some areas Thursday. Cain, of the Cajun Navy, said even his storm-hardened rescue crews were being especially cautious because Michael knocked down so many trees and utility poles. This one is so powerful that my guys are having to use chain saws to cut through downed trees to get into the neighborhoods, Cain said. This one is just real bad, and no one saw it coming. Meteorologists had seen Michael coming and had been warning for several days that it was a serious storm. But what they did not anticipate, many said, was Michaels furious intensification in the hours before it made landfall, and how far inland it managed to maintain that ferocity. Wow! This one we werent expecting, said Steve Bowen, director and meteorologist at the risk consultancy Aon, who works with insurance agencies to analyze natural disaster risk. He said Michael broke many rules because it maintained hurricane intensity nearly 200 miles inland. Bowen said Michael, the most intense hurricane on record to strike the Panhandle, is likely to lead to a rethinking of building codes in the area. The homes arent really built to withstand these sorts of winds in the Florida Panhandle, he said. He and other officials estimated that Michaels damage would run into the billions of dollars, even though the storm did not strike a major population center as Hurricane Harvey did when it made landfall in Texas and then hovered over Houston last year, dropping record amounts of rain. Michael blasted apart homes, businesses and landmarks across a part of Florida not accustomed to direct hits from monster hurricanes. Robin Ford, who co-owns 4C BBQ Family Restaurant in Defuniak Springs, was helping feed hundreds of first responders with a giant smoker on Thursday, handing out brisket, steaks and pulled pork. His restaurant is about 45 miles northwest of Panama City, and the area has become a staging ground for first responders. I hate to say this, but we are sending these first responders into a war zone, Ford said. I used to be a deputy sheriff in Texas, and we had a tornado come through, and this is what it looked like. It looked like a nuclear bomb went off. Ford, an Air Force veteran, is president of Healing Tools for Warriors, which works with veterans and first responders with PTSD to help out in natural disasters, and make them a part of society again let them know they are heroes. He said two veterans had decided to stay in Panama City during the storm. Some guys with PTSD dont want to go to shelters because its hard being in crowds, he said. Its hard for them to evacuate. Those two veterans were eventually rescued by the National Guard after the roof had blown off the building they were in. Penny Pinkham, founder of Healing Tools for Warriors, said she and others from her organization are seeing awful things. She said much of the Bay Medical Centers roof ws torn away. Theres just devastation everywhere, she said, adding that many people were still communicating by walkie-talkies on Thursday because cellphone service was still down. Ford said scores of other veterans were helping out, clearing debris and assisting emergency responders. We are loading up water and blankets, and we are taking stuff to anyone who has nothing, Ford said. And thats looking like a lot of people. On St. George Island, about 75 miles southeast of Panama City, Nick Cabrera, 39, and his wife Amy, 37, rode out the storm along with eight children, ages 2 to 16. Amy Cabrera is the innkeeper for the St. George Inn, where they sheltered. She said they considered leaving. We werent sure which way to go, so we just kinda decided to stay, Nick Cabrera said. The water coming up was pretty crazy. Picnic tables floating by. It didnt cover the street signs, but it was close. Kevin Begos in Apalachicola, Fla., Carmen K.

John Newsom,"GREENSBORO — A motorist was killed when a tree fell on his car and hundreds of homes and businesses in Greensboro were damaged Sunday afternoon as a suspected tornado raced from south to north along the city's east side. The tornado, not yet confirmed, was first spotted near U.S. 29 and East Gate City Boulevard about 5:15 p.m. on a rainy, cloudy afternoon. Roughly 15 minutes later, a second suspected tornado was reported in the Monroeton community southwest of Reidsville. City Manager Jim Westmoreland told reporters Sunday night that the National Weather Service has not yet confirmed that a tornado struck the city. Weather service officials will be here Monday to determine whether to blame the death and damage on straight-line winds or a tornado. Greensboro police said Anthony George, 48, of Greensboro was killed at 5:46 p.m. when a tree fell on his moving BMW at East Cone Boulevard and Ceasar Street. Two other people were injured in the same incident: Renee George, 49, a passenger in the BMW; and Becky Combs, 48, of Liberty, who was driving a Dodge Avenger that was hit by the same tree. Neither woman suffered life-threatening injuries. No other people were reported injured during or after the fast-moving storm. Emergency personnel are going door-to-door Sunday night in affected areas to make sure there are no other deaths or injuries. The weather service warned of tornadoes all Sunday afternoon, which turned cloudy and then rainy. And then the rain fell harder and the wind started to blow. ""It was real quiet and calm and then the wind picked up and it went downhill from there,"" said Kay Cassidy, whose backyard fence at her South English Street home was a casualty of the storm. Damage was extensive on Greensboro's east side and in pockets of Rockingham County. In Greensboro, the worst of the damage occurred in a four-mile line that stretches roughly from Barber Park to Phillips Avenue. Multiple city streets are closed because the storm knocked down numerous trees and power lines. Guilford County Schools will be closed Monday because of extensive damage and power outages at 15 schools and the Franklin Boulevard administrative offices. Three schools — Erwin, Hampton and Peeler Open elementaries — sustained severe damage. At Hampton Elementary, the storm destroyed the mobile units parked next to the Trade Street school. LaToy Kennedy, Hampton's principal, said she hoped her students and their families are OK. ""We're a family,"" she said. ""We'll get through this together."" Elsewhere in Greensboro, the storm tore off part of the roof of the McGirt-Horton Branch Library on Phillips Avenue. On Rankin Mill Road, a car wash lost its roof. On South English Street, an apartment complex also lost part of its room. The storm turned vehicles upside down on Phillips Avenue. Numerous homes were damaged, some badly, throughout the city's east side. On Sunnycrest Avenue, several men were preparing for a Masonic lodge initiation ceremony as the storm approached. They left the lodge before the winds kicked up. They watched from a distance as the storm toppled the cinderblock building. Mary Rogers was returning home from a neighborhood convenience store when she saw the tornado. She sought shelter in a neighbor's house. The neighbor is usually asleep in the afternoons, Rogers said. On this day, the neighbor was awake and let her in. ""I saw everything from the back door of my neighbor's house,"" Rogers said. At Rogers' home nearby, Andrew, her 10-year-old son, was watching TV. A piece of debris shattered the window in the room where he sat. Next door, a tree crashed through the roof above another neighbor's kitchen. Walter Jones, whose Avalon Road home backs up to Hampton Elementary, said he heard a loud rumbling noise and took shelter with his family in a hallway in the middle of the house. Then he heard a cracking sound. After the storm had passed, he found a large wooden beam sticking through the front wall of his house. T.J. Johnson was asleep when his mother called to warn him about the approaching storm. His home in the Briarwood neighborhood, where he has lived for 20 years, was spared. But several others nearby houses were damaged. ""I heard the rain,"" he said, ""but I didn't know (the tornado) was right here in my neighborhood."" On Rankin Mill Road, Coty Shelton, 24, inspected a car wash that lost its roof in the storm. Nearby, the car vacuums stood unmolested. Shelton lives on Hicone Road, not far from the damaged business. The tornado, he said, ""didn't come that far, luckily."" About 23,000 Greensboro homes and businesses were without power as of about 10 p.m. Sunday. Westmoreland said the city got about 1,000 calls for service from residents between 5 and 8 p.m. Sunday. Rail service was delayed by trees that fell on the tracks near Holts Chapel Road. The American Red Cross has set up an emergency shelter at Glenwood Recreation Center at 2010 Coliseum Boulevard. Pets are allowed. For people without cars, city buses will run to the shelter from Dudley High School and the intersection of East Market and English Street. City Councilwoman Sharon Hightower, whose district was hit hard by the storm, said it will take time to turn the power back on and clean up city streets. ""Tell each neighbor to be patient,"" she said. ""I know it can be frustrating."" In eastern Guilford County, the tornado’s touch on McLeansville Road was brief but brutal. A silo was lifted in the air and hurled from one side of the road to the other. A shed was toppled. Shingles were scattered. Trees were split almost down to their roots. In all, the storm cut a half-mile swath of destruction that residents say took them by surprise. And in the time it takes you to finish this sentence, it was gone. “It hammered us,” resident Steven Glass said. “No warning. We scattered to take cover. It was crazy. “We’re all lucky to be alive.” As night fell Sunday, and power was out on a portion of this rural road, residents gathered with flashlights in front yards a little shaken but grateful they survived. Comparing notes, they recalled the chill in the air moments before touchdown. Winds gusting. And then a torrential downpour. “It was so thick, you couldn’t see cars,” resident Josh Rumley remembered. Jeff Roberson, in from Las Vegas to visit his father, said there was just no time to react. “I didn’t hear it coming,” said Roberson, 48. “All of a sudden, the house started shaking. You saw trees flying. It went through pretty damn hard — and fast. “We were scared half to death.” In Rockingham County, county emergency officials said several people were hurt in the storm. None of their injuries are life-threatening. Two of the injured were driving on Grooms Road when their vehicle was struck by a mobile home blown across the street. County emergency officials also said the most severe damage was reported east of Reidsville. They said homes along Grooms Road, Frank Road and Rocky Ford Road were the hardest-hit. Several other homes along U.S. 158 West between Garrison and Chapmon roads, northeast of Reidsville, sustained severe damage. Elsewhere in North Carolina, severe storms caused the Charlotte airport to close briefly. Television stations in Charlotte posted images of large hail on Twitter, and the National Weather Service received reports of golf ball-sized hail in several counties.",Greensboro News & Record Suspected tornado kills 1 in Greensboro; damage extensive on city's east side Greensboro News & Record GREENSBORO — A motorist was killed and hundreds of homes and businesses in Greensboro were damaged Sunday afternoon as a suspected …,2018-04-15T22:18:57Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Greensboro.com'}",Suspected tornado kills 1 in Greensboro; damage extensive on city's east side - Greensboro News & Record,http://www.greensboro.com/news/local_news/suspected-tornado-kills-in-greensboro-damage-extensive-on-city-s/article_3fa1e99a-5bed-57d8-8f2f-010f944a75ec.html,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/greensboro.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/0e/30e1454b-c1f2-5568-b518-fac84ba5dee1/5ad414864a4e3.preview-100.jpg?crop=87%2C65%2C6%2C0&resize=267%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize,,Greensboro.com,storm complex,1
FRANCES ROBLES and SHERI FINK,"Following public debate over the Trump administration’s initial reluctance to deploy it, the Comfort arrived two weeks into the disaster, after some of the medical urgency had abated. Its mission and capabilities were opaque to many doctors on the island. It lacked the ability to treat some important areas of need, and the complex referral procedures made little sense on a battered island with scant power or telephone service. Photo Staffed with 800 medical personnel, the hospital ship admitted about 290 patients. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times The result, combined with the reluctance of some hospitals to lose their own patients, fell far short of what the Comfort could have provided, medical experts said. “They were prepared for anything other than the reality of Puerto Rico,” said José Vargas Vidot, a doctor and independent senator in the Puerto Rican Senate whose charitable organization, Iniciativa Comunitaria, supported the post-hurricane medical clinic directed by Dr. Rosado. “It was like a vision in the harbor. Everybody was looking at the Comfort, like trying to build hope. But in the reality it was very frustrating to get access.” Staffed with 800 personnel and costing $180,000 a day, the ship received an average of 36 people a day as outpatients or inpatients. (A New York Times reporter was one of them, given an X-ray and medicine for an asthmatic cough). And that number swelled only after a public furor erupted over the ship’s empty beds. “That’s not the right question,” said Capt. Kevin Buckley, the commander of the ship’s medical facility, when asked how many patients were admitted. The right question, he said, was: “What kind of patients do you have?” The patients who arrived in the early weeks “were as sick as the sickest patient in any I.C.U. where I’ve worked,” said Capt. José A. Acosta, the United States Third Fleet surgeon, a Puerto Rican-trained physician who served as a liaison with the Comfort. In all, 191 surgeries, including 25 major orthopedic cases, were performed aboard the ship. Doctors delivered two babies and diagnosed seven people with cancer. One woman had a double mastectomy, and the ship filled the oxygen tanks for dozens of patients who needed help breathing. It took in some patients from hospitals where generators had failed. It treated 98 critically ill patients, eleven of whom died. The Comfort’s deployment was not the only federal health care initiative after Maria hit. Federal field hospitals, clinics and medical shelters saw more than 30,000 patients, and more than 1,400 uninsured people filled their prescriptions at pharmacies for free thanks to a federal reimbursement program. Photo Medical staff took a blood sample from a patient in the emergency room aboard the Comfort. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times A mid-November visit to the ship found dozens of people waiting to see doctors in the tents set up outside, but inside most of the beds were empty. Only a handful of patients were on board, and most of the doctors were milling about. But those who were getting treatment appeared satisfied. Olga Quezada’s knee had swollen up as if someone had pumped air into it. She had been turned away by her local hospital, and she worried about the pain, the bill and finding care. Ship doctors stuck a frighteningly long needle into her knee to drain the fluid, for free. “At first, I went to hospital in Bayamón, and they told me to come back,” Ms. Quezada said. She added: “I really like the doctors here.” The Comfort is used on relief missions about every two years. It served off the coast of Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm in 1990 and 1991 and provided aid during the rescue of Cuban and Haitian migrants in 1994. The Comfort was deployed in Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, the Comfort provided much-needed surgical care, but communication with referring doctors and with family members was problematic. Some patients died during laborious, multistep transfers, and some doctors felt the ship left too soon. Doctors in Puerto Rico said the Comfort could have been of enormous help directly after the storm, because at first many hospitals were damaged or shuttered. Without air-conditioning, temperatures soared dangerously, and operating rooms were closed as generators failed. Emergency room staff sewed wounds, lanced boils and examined patients by the light of cellphones and flashlights. They lacked access to CT scans. In the 10 days after the Sept. 20 storm, the number of deaths in Puerto Rico jumped to an average of 118 a day, 36 more than usual. Photo A radiology specialist prepared a patient for an X-ray aboard the Comfort, which deployed to Puerto Rico for 53 days. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times But the ship did not leave Virginia until Sept. 29, arriving in Puerto Rico on Oct. 3. Problems quickly emerged. For starters, the Comfort lacked critical capacities, including the ability to treat premature babies and patients with common antibiotic-resistant infections, head trauma and strokes requiring neurosurgery, or heart conditions needing bypass surgery. One doctor was heard complaining about receiving so-called “social cases”— patients who would be difficult to discharge because they lost their homes or lacked caregivers. When the ship docked in San Juan, residents were thrilled. “People saw the big, white ship and came running,” said Murad Raheem, a regional emergency coordinator for the Department of Health and Human Services who oversaw the federal government’s health response to the disaster. The Comfort cared for 67 patients in its first two days, but wasn’t set up to receive unscreened patients, Mr. Raheem said. Soon after the ship’s arrival, Puerto Rican and federal officials and local medical professionals met on the Comfort. They decided the ship should move around the island to assist “wherever the needs were at the time,” Mr. Raheem said. But they agreed that doctors around the island would need to vet potential patient transfers through the Puerto Rico Medical Services Administration, the large and overburdened public hospital in San Juan that normally served as a referral center. Only if the hospital was full would a case be reviewed for possible referral to the Comfort. Patient flow slowed to a trickle. According to the Navy, only 137 patients were delivered over a period of three weeks. The first phone numbers provided by the public hospital did not work, and others had to be established. Callers overwhelmed the cellphone of the emergency department director after his number was posted on Facebook. Photo In all, 191 surgeries, including 25 major orthopedic cases, were performed aboard the Comfort. Doctors delivered two babies and diagnosed seven people with cancer. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times In areas without working cellphones, land lines or satellite phones, and with only ambulance radios to communicate, “referring patients to the Comfort was impossible,” said Dr. Rene Purcell-Jordan, an emergency room physician in Yauco, in southwest Puerto Rico. Dr. Purcell and other doctors said they also had little information about what type of patients the Comfort could or would treat. Some problems were beyond the Comfort’s control. Poor weather grounded helicopters. Some local hospital administrators were reluctant to give up their patients, and sometimes patients themselves wanted to stay near home, even when conditions at their hospitals appeared dangerous. Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló petitioned for changes. He said the ship’s roving mission was appropriate immediately after the storm when roads were impassable, but that as time passed it made more sense to allow seven hub hospitals to refer patients directly and ultimately for patients to refer themselves. The Comfort returned to the port in Old San Juan. This time, federal Disaster Medical Assistance Teams set up in tents outside the ship, and thousands of people went for prescriptions and care. Those who needed something the tents could not provide, like surgery or X-rays, were taken on to the ship. “No one who walked up to the ship has been denied care,” Captain Buckley said. Officials at the public hospital defended the Comfort’s operation. “The Comfort was not a party boat,” said Dr. Carlos A. Gómez, the head of the hospital’s emergency room. “You need criteria to go to a hospital, whether it’s at sea or on land.” Still, the mission to the end remained murky. On Nov. 15 the Comfort left the dock, with a spokesman saying the ship planned to restock at sea and then resume treating patients. On Nov. 17, the ship was ordered home, for good, without warning.

BLAKE NICHOLSON / AP,"Blizzard warnings were posted from Colorado to Minnesota on Wednesday and wildfires were a concern in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma as the second so-called “bomb cyclone” storm in less than a month hit the central U.S., raising the prospect of renewed flooding in the already drenched Midwest.Heavy snow disrupted ground and air travel Wednesday. Roads became impassable and visibility was down to a few feet in northeastern South Dakota due to heavy snowfall. About half of the daily flights at Denver International Airport were canceled.
Up to 2 ½ feet (0.61 meters) of snow was expected to fall in parts of eastern South Dakota and southwestern Minnesota, the National Weather Service said. Winds in excess of 50 mph (80.46 kph) also were expected, creating life-threatening conditions.
“We’re calling it historic because of the widespread heavy snow. We will set some records,” said Mike Connelly, a weather service meteorologist in Aberdeen, South Dakota.
Transportation officials closed Interstate 29 from east central South Dakota to the North Dakota border, as well as a 270-mile (434-kilometer) section of Interstate 90 between Rapid City and Mitchell, South Dakota.
Numerous traffic crashes were reported in northeastern South Dakota, and the storm knocked out power to thousands of homes and businesses in Sioux Falls.
Officials in Colorado closed a 150-mile (241-kilometer) stretch of Interstate 76 from just northeast of Denver to the Nebraska border, and Gov. Jared Polis activated the National Guard in case troops are needed to rescue stranded motorists.
Multiple crashes in Minnesota along a snowy stretch of Interstate 35 prompted officials to close about 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the highway about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Minneapolis .
In Nebraska, the State Patrol was sending additional troopers into the state’s panhandle, and officials closed Interstate 80 in that region.
“This storm is going to be dangerous,” Patrol Maj. Russ Stanczyk said.
An unusual but not rare weather phenomenon known as “thunder snow” — snow accompanied by thunder and lightning — was reported in central South Dakota.
“It’s essentially a thunderstorm, but it’s cold enough for snow,” Connelly said.
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem closed state government offices in 52 counties. Numerous schools around the state closed, along with several Black Hills National Forest offices in western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming.
Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts extended five weather-related executive orders until May 15 to help communities gain fast access to the state’s emergency resources. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said “the National Guard stands ready” to rescue any stranded motorists.
The weather service posted an ice storm warning into Friday morning for a portion of southern Minnesota, saying up to three-fourths of an inch of ice could accumulate on power lines, leading to outages.
To the west, the looming spring blizzard in the Rockies impacted flights, school classes, government functions and even baseball.
Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies postponed an afternoon game against the Atlanta Braves until August. Many school districts in Colorado and Wyoming canceled or shortened classes. Local governments, including in Denver and Cheyenne, Wyoming, and state government in the Denver area closed offices early.
Strong winds associated with the weather system were creating dangerous wildfire and travel conditions in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. The weather service issued a high wind warning for the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles.
Winds in excess of 50 mph (80.46 kph) were combining with low humidity and an unstable atmosphere to create critical fire conditions in the three states. Forecasters in New Mexico said the winds also would make travel difficult on north-south oriented roads such as Interstate 25. In southern New Mexico, the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range closed Wednesday because of the high winds.
The storm technically met the scientific definition of what’s commonly known as a “bomb cyclone,” said David Roth, a forecaster at the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.
The weather phenomenon with a complex scientific definition essentially entails a rapid drop in air pressure and a storm strengthening explosively. What is more important than the term is the storm’s impacts, which are likely to be similar to last month’s storm , Roth said.
That blast dropped heavy snow and led to massive flooding in the Midwest that caused billions of dollars in damage in Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa and South Dakota.
“Hopefully this time it will be a slow snowmelt,” Roth said.
Forecasters said this week’s storm will swell rivers again, though likely not to the levels seen last month due to the absence of a wet snowpack on frozen ground this time around.
Even moderate rises in the Missouri River will push more water into drenched Fremont County in southwestern Iowa, Emergency Manager Mike Crecelius said. Last month’s flooding swamped 455 houses and thousands of acres of farmland in his region.
“The problem is that we’re not getting any time for the water to recede and things to dry out, so the levees can’t be fixed; houses can’t be fixed; crops can’t be planted,” he said.

Matthew Jacobs,"On Saturday morning, Jane Fonda, Gloria Allred and Tessa Thompson led evangelizing cries in the name of women’s rights during Sundance ’s snow-drenched Respect Rally. About an hour later, “The Tale,” a provocative Laura Dern movie about sexual power dynamics, premiered to a standing ovation. Three days into the festival, it’s by far the standout jewel ― an absorbing, articulate capsule that underscores the dynamics unfolding in the days of #MeToo. Much will be said about the timeliness of “The Tale,” a dramatization of writer-director Jennifer Fox’s adolescent affair with two adult athletic trainers who provided an ostensible paradise away from her dispiriting home life. Just as much should be said of its craftsmanship. Fox mines her background as a documentarian (she helmed the acclaimed “Beirut: The Last Home Movie” and “An American Love Story,” among others) to forge a framing device that treats memories ― those relics we hold so dear ― as unreliable sources. Employed to depict decades-old sexual assault, the tactic interrogates the ways a survivor can convince herself that what she experienced was something she invited, or at least something she accepted as an authentic emotional buttress. Dern portrays Fox, better known as Jenny, a globetrotting journalist who’s comfortable camouflaging herself in unfamiliar environments to capture lives not often glorified. Her saga begins in earnest when her mother, played by Ellen Burstyn, discovers a short story Jenny wrote at 13. “I’d like to begin this story by telling you something so beautiful,” it reads. But what follows, in hindsight, is anything but. Jenny’s tale recounts what began as exuberant self-discovery: She found a haven in a horseback riding instructor named Mrs. G (Elizabeth Debicki) and a celebrated running coach named Bill (Jason Ritter). Together, Mrs. G and Bill mentored teenagers in the verdant Virginia countryside. But they oversaw far more than Jenny’s outdoor recreation; they made her their lover, taking her virginity and cajoling her with youthful sweet nothings. “I want to save you from all those stupid young boys out there,” Bill coos as Jenny’s wide, callow eyes stare back at him, at last finding the attention her aloof parents denied her. “The Tale” is a memoir in big-screen format, one that’s likely to spark debates about both its content and its stylistic choices. For my money, it’s stunning. The ways Jenny, at 48, romanticized her impressions of Bill and Mrs. G ― she’s always thought of him as her first boyfriend ― are revealed in shards, past and present, melding to demonstrate her warped memories. At the risk of hyperbole, I’ve never seen a movie like this. Fox pushes the limitations of narrative cinema, presenting Jenny’s undercooked remembrances as fact and then correcting them with delicate, psychologically deft subtlety. The adult Jenny and the 13-year-old Jenny (played by Isabelle Nélisse) sometimes break the fourth wall, addressing each other to exchange contradicting recollections. Was Bill raping Jenny? She doesn’t think so, until she investigates further, tracking down her old mentors to better understand what she went through. Scenes glide from one to the next, with Jenny’s short story ― recited in fragmented voice-over by Dern ― anchoring Fox’s exploration. A filmmaker introducing so many meta conceits is a gamble, and here it pays off in spades. Some may protest the depiction of Bill fornicating with young Jenny, but the film is never exploitative about its presentation. It’s shot mostly in closeup so as to telegraph emotions instead of sensuality. A title card at the end reveals that an adult body double stood in for Nélisse during sex scenes with Ritter, and at the Q&amp;A onstage after the premiere, Fox said she used verbal cues so Nélisse, 11 at the time of the shoot, wouldn’t need to feign copulation during her closeups. (“Pretend you’re being stung by a bee,” for example.) To wit, these scenes ― difficult to watch but vital ― underscore Fox’s wish to delineate the way the director “constructed a story to survive.” Jenny is no Lolita. Throughout the movie, the adult Jenny, attempting to justify her past, says, “But that was the ’70s.” Nobody talked about sexual assault or power conflicts with the import that today’s dialogue assumes. But one line in Jenny’s short story is the most searing of all, crystallizing the power of #MeToo, which seeks to correct what was commonplace in the ’70s: “I find that I trust him so much I never understand where he’s leading me. Once we’re that far, I never know how to say no.” Bill’s is textbook cult behavior, but Jenny’s naivety and appetite for affection cloud her judgment. We see that unfurl with a sophistication that stretches beyond a hashtag or a headline-friendly social movement. This is one woman’s personal history, divorced from the trappings of any cultural talking points. (Inevitably, prepare for a storm of think-pieces.) Fox said at the Q&amp;A that Dern signed on for “The Tale” a year and a half before the movie was financed ― a proactive move that signals her dedication to the story. It paid off. The film is cathartic and angry, but never preachy. It’s the work of an artist who has spent her life seeking the truth and learning from the past. It’s a meditation worthy of the highest praise. Most signficantly, it’s a salve.","Writer-director Jennifer Fox's autobiographical drama tells a complex story of rape, power and misremembering.",2018-01-21T18:45:10Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",This Stunning Film About Childhood Sexual Abuse Is 2018′s First #MeToo Movie,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-tale-laura-dern-review_us_5a63c335e4b0dc592a0966f3,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a60dda01e00003d005adb6e.jpeg?ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,storm complex,1
Alex Davies,"Dhananjay Motwani is thinking of an animal, and his 20 Questions opponent is, question by question, trying to figure out what it is.
Is it larger than a microwave oven?Yes.Can it do tricks?Maybe.Is it a predator?No.Is it soft?No.Is it a vegetarian?Yes.
Whats impressive here isnt that the questioner is a computer; thats old hat. Its that the machine and Motwani are chatting in his blue Hyundai Sonata, trundling along one of Silicon Valleys many freeways. The traffic, as it tends to be in this part of the country, is bad. The game is a good way not just to pass the time, but to show off what the Echo Auto can do as we creep toward the Sunnyvale lab where Amazon taught it to understand the human voice in the acoustic crucible that is the car.
Amazon introduced the road-going, Alexa-equipped device in September of last year, and started shipping to some customers in January. Amazon is working with some automakers to build Alexa into new cars, but the $50 Auto works with tens of millions of older vehicles already on the road: All you need is a power source (either a USB port or cigarette lighter) and a way to tap into the cars speakers (Bluetooth or an aux cable).
About the size and shape of a cassette, the Echo Auto sits on your dashboard and brings 70,000 Alexa skills into your car. Its eight built-in microphones let you make phone calls, set reminders, compile shopping lists, find nearby restaurants and coffee shops, and hear Jake Gyllenhaal narrate The Great Gatsby.
An Artificial Head Measurement System with the acoustically relevant structures of the human anatomy plays a key role in Amazon's development of the Echo Auto.
Adding the Auto to a growing collection of Echo products makes sense. Theres no better place for voice than in the car, says Miriam Daniel, Amazons head of Echo products. Your hands are supposed to be on the wheel, your eyes on the road. But when she and her team started developing the thing about 18 months ago, they discovered that theres no worse place than the car for making voice recognition actually work. We thought the kitchen was the most challenging acoustic environment, Daniel says. But family chatter and humming refrigerators proved easy to overcome compared to wind, air conditioning, rain, the radio, and road noise. The car was like a war zone.
To safely cross the aural minefield, Daniels team started by adapting the Echos hardware, software, and user interface to the car. That meant adjusting the device so it can handle being turned on and off frequently, and boot up in a few seconds instead of the minute and a half it took when they first tried it. The team adjusted its responses to be shorter. They added geolocation, so the device can point users to the nearest caffeine injection site. They disabled incoming Drop Ins, where approved friends and such can automatically connect to ones Echo device for a chat.
Daniels team created new audio cues and streamlined the potentially distracting activity of the Autos LED bar. They gave it one tiny speaker to play the occasional error message, but chose to rely on the cars audio system to do the heavy lifting, to reduce the Autos bulk and cost. They tested a variety of microphone arrays and settled on the dashboard as the best placement after eliminating the cupholder (far from the drivers mouth and prone to rattling about), clipped onto an air vent (too noisy), and ceiling (would leave wires dangling all over the place).
At Amazons reliability lab, the Echo Auto endured climatic chambers, heat and UV exposure, drop testsjust what they sound likeand yank tests, in which a specialized device yanks cords out of the thing with different levels of force. Standard stuff for all Echo devices.
But making sure the Echo can hear you properly in a moving car took a new kind of test. Thats why Motwani, an Alexa product manager, is pondering large, not-soft herbivores while driving me to Amazons testing complex in Sunnyvale. The complex contains mocked up kitchens and living rooms, but Im not allowed to see those. Instead Motwani leads me into a gray room the size of a one-car garage, most of it taken up by a black Honda Accord.
Amazon build a library of road noises by sending drivers into the wild in cars loaded up with microphones, then playing the sound recorded by each at the speaker in the same location.
For up to 18 hours on end, the dummy will talk to the Echo Auto sitting on the dash, calling out the same commands and queries over and over again.
In the drivers seat is what looks a bit like the upper bit of a crash test dummy, a head and shoulders mounted on a gray plastic box. The head features a black cross where a human has eyes and a nose, a pill-shaped opening for a mouth, and unsettlingly accurate, molded ears. Its maker, Head Acoustics, calls it an Artificial Head Measurement System with the acoustically relevant structures of the human anatomy, and Its a common tool in audio testing. Also in the Honda are six large speakers, placed throughout the cabin.
Standing by the computers on a table against one wall, Motwani and two of his fellow Amazon engineers decide to start their demonstration at 40 mph, in the rain. A few keystrokes later, the speakers come to life, and the inside of the unmoving, sheltered car becomes an auditory facsimile of what it sounds like to drive through a storm: the pelting rain, the swiping windshield wipers, the engine running, the tires humming against the wet asphalt. Theyve collected these sounds by sending drivers into the wild in cars loaded up with microphones, then playing the sound recorded by each at the speaker in the same location.
From the computer, the engineers show off the other conditions the car can mimic: different speeds, changing weather conditions, windows up or down, talk radio or music blaring. This is where the dummy goes to work, and when I learn why its sole facial feature is a mouth, which is really a speaker. For up to 18 hours on end, it will talk to the Echo Auto sitting on the dash, calling out the same commands and queries over and over again. The team records Alexas responses, looking for weak points and misunderstandings. This is how machine learning happens: You feed your system as much data as you can find. And the process works best when that data is carefully selected (or created) to simulate what Alexa will be listening for.
Now that the Echo Auto has shipped to some customers, the garage-lab is focused on improving its performance in extreme conditions like convertibles and rain (though probably not the combination of the two). Like other Alexa products, it will keep getting better, and keep adding skills. But today, at least, it hasnt bested the human mind: my ride with Motwani ended before it could figure out what animal he was thinking of. It was an elephant.

Sean Gallagher,"reader comments 5 On April 13, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom launched the largest barrage of cruise missiles since the opening of the Gulf War. One hundred and five cruise missiles launched from sea and air struck three alleged chemical weapons facilities in Syria. The majority of the US military's strike package—75 cruise missiles—targeted a cluster of three buildings in the outskirts of Damascus, in the midst of Syria's greatest concentration of air defenses. But while President Donald Trump was quick to tweet ""MISSION ACCOMPLISHED,"" US military officials have already acknowledged that the strikes did little to blunt Syria's capacity to manufacture and deliver chemical weapons. The mission was a compromise from the start, targeting facilities that would result in the lowest possible probability of loss of civilian life. And the US warned Russia in advance using the deconfliction line between the US and Russian militaries that there would be an operation over Syria, tipping off Russia and Syria of the strike Trump had already promised was coming. The strike did accomplish a few things besides blowing up (apparently empty) buildings. It demonstrated how the US, French, and British militaries are capable of orchestrating a joint strike operation on (relatively) short notice, as well as the effectiveness of two relatively new weapons systems. It also demonstrated how some of the oldest weapons systems in the US military's inventory can still serve a role in these sorts of operations. And the strike gave nearly everyone but the US Army and US Coast Guard an opportunity to take part. In other words, the attack was a very expensive, short lead time exercise that demonstrated to Syria and Russia what the US and its allies could do if they really meant business.

Before and after images of an alleged chemical weapons storage site at Him Shinsar. Before and after strike images of a purported chemical weapons bunker adjacent to the storage facility at Him Shinsar. The US Navy fired 66 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) as part of the strike. The TLAM, built by Raytheon, is the most battle-tested cruise missile in use by any military; so far the US Navy has fired more than 2,000 of them in anger since the opening of the Gulf War in 1990. From the Red Sea, the Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Monterey (CG-61) launched 30 TLAMs, and the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Laboon (DDG-58) launched seven TLAMs. In the Arabian Gulf, the Burke -class USS Higgins (DDG-76) launched 23 Tomahawks. And the remaining six were fired by the Virginia -class attack submarine USS John Warner (SSN-785) from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. But the Navy wasn't the only US participant in the strike. Two B-1B Lancer bombers launched 19 AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSMs). This was the first combat use of the JASSM, which initially entered service in 2009; an extended-range version (with a reach of 500 nautical miles) was brought into service in 2014. The JASSM is designed to be more stealthy than the Tomahawk, so, in theory, it has a higher probability of penetrating advanced air defenses like those Russia has deployed around its bases in Syria. Because the B-1Bs launched their weapons outside of Syrian airspace, they didn't require fighter cover. The only escort they had, according to the Pentagon, was a single Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft, which may have provided some radar-jamming cover for the launch of the JASSMs. The EA-6B, retired by the Navy, has been in service since the 1960s. In addition to the strike missions, there were F/A-18s on combat air patrol to be on guard for retributive strikes, and refueling tankers were ready to support the US and allied aircraft in the strike. The exact number of aircraft involved overall was not revealed by the Pentagon. The JASSM wasn't the only relatively new weapon brought to this one-sided shooting match. UK and French forces launched air and ship-based versions of a jointly developed cruise missile, which the British poetically call the Storm Shadow and French call the Système de Croisière Autonome à Longue Portée (Long Range Standoff Cruise Missile), or SCALP. Initially developed as an air-launched weapon by the European defense company MBDA Systems, SCALP/Storm Shadow has been deployed since 2002; it has since been modified into a Naval Cruise Missile ( Missile de Croisière Naval ) for the French, first deployed in 2015. Since the SCALP has a range of more than 300 nautical miles, British and French forces were able to launch their part of the attack well offshore from Syria. The Royal Air Force launched eight Storm Shadow missiles from Tornado and Typhoon fighters; nine SCALP missiles were fired from Rafale and Mirage fighters of the French Air Force. And the French Navy's FREMM frigate Languedoc (D-653) fired three Naval Cruise Missiles from the Eastern Mediterranean. This is the first time the British have fired the Storm Shadow in combat, though the British have provided the missile to the Saudis for use in Yemen. The French had previously only used the SCALP in combat against ISIS targets in December 2015 and January 2016, following ISIS terrorist attacks in Paris. What got hit The US attack focused heavily on the Barzah Research and Development Center in Damascus, a three-building complex that Department of Defense officials claimed was involved in chemical-weapons research. An Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons report from March found no evidence of chemical-weapons research, development, or production at the facility. But that did not deter the US from firing 75 missiles at the complex: 57 of the 66 TLAMs and all 19 JASSMs. The reason for the overwhelming attack on the site was that Damascus is among the most heavily defended bits of airspace in the world. With all of the missiles launched to strike with the same ""time on target,"" the number of incoming missiles was intended to overwhelm Syrian air defenses. None of the missiles was intercepted; in fact, Syrian defenders didn't launch any anti-aircraft missiles until after all 105 missiles had detonated on their targets, according to DOD officials. As a result, satellite photos showed that the Barzah facility was completely turned into rubble. British and French strikes, along with the nine remaining TLAMs, were focused on what the allies claim was a chemical weapons storage facility and a chemical warfare operations bunker at Him Shinshar, west of the Syrian city of Homs. A total of 22 missiles—the nine remaining TLAMs, the RAF's eight Storm Shadow missiles, three French Naval Cruise Missiles, and two SCALP missiles, struck the alleged weapons storage facility. The remaining seven SCALP missiles hit the bunker. Syria and Russia claimed after the attack that 71 of the missiles were intercepted by air defenses. But according to the Pentagon, Syria launched about 40 air-defense missiles after the strike had been completed without any guidance. And while Russian forces' S-400 Triumf anti-aircraft missile systems had their radars active, they failed to lock onto any targets or launch any missiles of their own, despite (or because of) US forewarnings of the attack. What’s the damage? President Trump hailed the strike as successfully meeting its objectives via Twitter. Pentagon officials were more circumspect in their analysis, saying that the strike achieved ""a long term degradation"" of Syria's capability to develop and deploy chemical weapons. Israeli intelligence officials, however, were quoted as saying the strikes did little if anything. According to Ynet News, one senior official said: If President Trump had ordered the strike only to show that the US responded to Assad's use of chemical weapons, then that goal has been achieved. But if there was another objective—such as paralyzing the ability to launch chemical weapons or deterring Assad from using [them] again—it's doubtful any of these objectives have been met. Which raises the question: if the strike really did meet Trump's metrics for ""Mission Accomplished,"" what exactly was the mission to begin with?

Annie Sneed,"When Hurricane Harvey’s record-busting rains drenched Texas in August 2017, they triggered a cascade of chaos. Widespread flooding turned roads into rivers, impeding evacuations and access to emergency services. Stormwater swept up pathogens from wastewater treatment plants and toxins from Superfund sites, posing health threats. Phone and internet services failed in some areas, and 300,000 people in Texas lost power. Harvey also temporarily shut down a quarter of U.S. oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, raising gas prices.
Such scenarios—climatic events causing impacts that can themselves trigger still more chains of effects, like intersecting rows of toppling dominoes—are a key focus of the fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA), released by the U.S. federal government at the end of November. For the first time, the 300 government, academic and nonprofit experts who contribute to the report devoted an entire chapter to the under-studied but critical interaction between climate change and what are called complex systems.
The report emphasizes that scientists need to look not only at how global warming is changing natural systems but also how those changes will set off their own ripple effects through other areas—for example, how the increasing threat of drought harms agriculture, which in turn affects the economy and food availability. “Reality is complex. In a changing climate, nothing is being affected all by itself,” says Katharine Mach, a senior research scientist at Stanford University and one of the NCA authors. The complexity of these cascading effects means they can often be hard—or even impossible—to understand or predict in a meaningful way.  But that is exactly what scientists are now trying to figure out how to do.
SCRATCHING THE SURFACE
Researchers typically study systems in relative isolation, deliberately overlooking convoluted interactions for the sake of scientific clarity. For instance, they might study what roads a heavy rain will flood—but not how a storm’s damage to communications or emergency services might interact with those road blockages, creating more knock-on effects. “You might ask what’s going on with, say, this one forest or this one agricultural crop. You draw boundaries around your system, and you’re just looking inside the box of your study,” Mach says.  That turns out to be a major weakness when scientists are trying to understand the potential risks and myriad impacts of climate change.
Here is a simple example: If researchers want to see how climate change will affect energy systems, they might simply model the effects of rising temperatures and heat waves on electricity demand. This could lead them to conclude that more power plants need to be built to keep up with higher energy demands for cooling. But a study with such a singular focus would overlook a critical pitfall: hotter temperatures also make drought conditions more likely in some areas, meaning there is less water to cool down power plants—and what water there is tends to be warmer, making it less effective for cooling. This complex interaction, which might typically be ignored, can significantly damage energy production. That is exactly what happened in Texas and the Southeast U.S. during recent droughts. Through such cases, “you realize that the problem you actually need to solve in the real world is more complex than the problem you thought you had,” says NCA co-author Anthony Janetos, director of the Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future at Boston University. “You could spend a lot of money fixing the wrong thing.”
It is easier to see the dynamics between all these environmental and human systems in hindsight, because scientists can follow the threads of various interactions that have already occurred. But it is much trickier to anticipate them, making the task of helping communities prepare for future climate impacts that much more difficult. Research in this arena is growing, but “we’ve just begun to scratch the surface of understanding these complexities,” says Leon Clarke, a senior scientist at the Joint Global Change Research Institute in Maryland and another NCA author.
Some new studies are looking at issues such as how climate-induced shocks to agriculture affect global markets, food prices and land use; the relationship between flood risk and what flood protection measures societies decide to take; how expanding reservoirs can actually worsen water shortages during drought; and the link between rising temperatures and violence.
One such study, still under review, looks at how Hurricane Harvey affected Houston’s road networks and, consequently, people’s access to emergency services during the storm. For this study researchers used flood data and modeling to analyze whether people living in two different neighborhoods had road access to fire stations and hospitals at various times during the storm. They also looked at how much longer it would take people to travel to those emergency services if their normal routes were blocked, and whether one neighborhood—with a lower average income—saw greater disruption to its road access. “That's the chain of events that we wanted to highlight,” says Avantika Gori, a researcher of flood risk management at Princeton University. She hopes such studies will give first responders better information about where to devote their limited resources and will help city planners be proactive about events like Hurricane Harvey. They could, for example, improve evacuation plans for specific neighborhoods and give better route information to emergency vehicles when a big storm hits.
MAKING CHOICES AMID COMPLEXITY
But experts note this type of research is incredibly challenging. It is hard enough to model one system on its own, let alone connect it with a series of others. Models needed to simulate various aspects of a problem (such as rainfall or how roads flood) may work at completely different time and spatial scales. Also, disparate data may need to be stitched together from different sources. And in general, the more complex a problem is, the more computer power and time it takes to run simulations. To complicate things further, a single research team may include social scientists, natural scientists, engineers and experts from other fields, all of whom use their own technical languages and methods for their work.
Constantly improving models, increasing computer power, and advances in techniques such as machine learning will help propel some progress, as will lessons learned from early studies now underway. Scientists may also need to combine simulations of future scenarios with expert interviews to help fill in forecasts with local, on-the-ground experience.
Beyond the research, scientists will also need to help decision-makers understand and make choices in light of all this complexity. For instance, since sea level rise predictions are uncertain, experts could assist a community in building an adjustable flood protection barrier. The good news is that some places, including New York City and Boston, have already begun considering complex systems as they prepare for climate change. “They’re doing a sophisticated job of modeling the interactions between sea level rise, storm surge, the particular geographies of their harbors and coastlines, and the infrastructure that is at risk,” Janetos says. “They’re considering lots of different dimensions as they think about how they’re going to respond in terms of adaptation.”
Still, experts acknowledge that ultimately they will never be able to put odds on every single possible set of interactions, Mach says. Rather it will be a matter of improving the available information to make better calls on what actions to take wherever possible. “We still need to make decisions,” she says. “We can’t let the complexity paralyze us.”","Motivated by events like Hurricane Harvey, researchers are trying to determine how climate change interacts with agriculture, energy, transportation and other human systems -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com",2018-12-27T11:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",The Next Climate Frontier: Predicting a Complex Domino Effect,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-next-climate-frontier-predicting-a-complex-domino-effect/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/CA7C67B2-BBB8-45D5-AF632C4E583F29CE.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,storm complex,1
Natalie Wolchover,"Half a century ago, the pioneers of chaos theory discovered that the “butterfly effect” makes long-term prediction impossible. Even the smallest perturbation to a complex system (like the weather, the economy or just about anything else) can touch off a concatenation of events that leads to a dramatically divergent future. Unable to pin down the state of these systems precisely enough to predict how they’ll play out, we live under a veil of uncertainty. Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences. But now the robots are here to help. In a series of results reported in the journals Physical Review Letters and Chaos, scientists have used machine learning —the same computational technique behind recent successes in artificial intelligence—to predict the future evolution of chaotic systems out to stunningly distant horizons. The approach is being lauded by outside experts as groundbreaking and likely to find wide application. “I find it really amazing how far into the future they predict” a system’s chaotic evolution, said Herbert Jaeger, a professor of computational science at Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany. The findings come from veteran chaos theorist Edward Ott and four collaborators at the University of Maryland. They employed a machine-learning algorithm called reservoir computing to “learn” the dynamics of an archetypal chaotic system called the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The evolving solution to this equation behaves like a flame front, flickering as it advances through a combustible medium. The equation also describes drift waves in plasmas and other phenomena, and serves as “a test bed for studying turbulence and spatiotemporal chaos,” said Jaideep Pathak, Ott’s graduate student and the lead author of the new papers. Jaideep Pathak, Michelle Girvan, Brian Hunt and Edward Ott of the University of Maryland, who (along with Zhixin Lu, now of the University of Pennsylvania) have shown that machine learning is a powerful tool for predicting chaos. After training itself on data from the past evolution of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the researchers’ reservoir computer could then closely predict how the flamelike system would continue to evolve out to eight “Lyapunov times” into the future, eight times further ahead than previous methods allowed, loosely speaking. The Lyapunov time represents how long it takes for two almost-identical states of a chaotic system to exponentially diverge. As such, it typically sets the horizon of predictability. “This is really very good,” Holger Kantz, a chaos theorist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany, said of the eight-Lyapunov-time prediction. “The machine-learning technique is almost as good as knowing the truth, so to say.” The algorithm knows nothing about the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation itself; it only sees data recorded about the evolving solution to the equation. This makes the machine-learning approach powerful; in many cases, the equations describing a chaotic system aren’t known, crippling dynamicists’ efforts to model and predict them. Ott and company’s results suggest you don’t need the equations—only data. “This paper suggests that one day we might be able perhaps to predict weather by machine-learning algorithms and not by sophisticated models of the atmosphere,” Kantz said. Besides weather forecasting, experts say the machine-learning technique could help with monitoring cardiac arrhythmias for signs of impending heart attacks and monitoring neuronal firing patterns in the brain for signs of neuron spikes. More speculatively, it might also help with predicting rogue waves, which endanger ships, and possibly even earthquakes. Ott particularly hopes the new tools will prove useful for giving advance warning of solar storms, like the one that erupted across 35,000 miles of the sun’s surface in 1859. That magnetic outburst created aurora borealis visible all around the Earth and blew out some telegraph systems, while generating enough voltage to allow other lines to operate with their power switched off. If such a solar storm lashed the planet unexpectedly today, experts say it would severely damage Earth’s electronic infrastructure. “If you knew the storm was coming, you could just turn off the power and turn it back on later,” Ott said. He, Pathak and their colleagues Brian Hunt, Michelle Girvan and Zhixin Lu (who is now at the University of Pennsylvania) achieved their results by synthesizing existing tools. Six or seven years ago, when the powerful algorithm known as “deep learning” was starting to master AI tasks like image and speech recognition, they started reading up on machine learning and thinking of clever ways to apply it to chaos. They learned of a handful of promising results predating the deep-learning revolution. Most importantly, in the early 2000s, Jaeger and fellow German chaos theorist Harald Haas made use of a network of randomly connected artificial neurons—which form the “reservoir” in reservoir computing—to learn the dynamics of three chaotically coevolving variables. After training on the three series of numbers, the network could predict the future values of the three variables out to an impressively distant horizon. However, when there were more than a few interacting variables, the computations became impossibly unwieldy. Ott and his colleagues needed a more efficient scheme to make reservoir computing relevant for large chaotic systems, which have huge numbers of interrelated variables. Every position along the front of an advancing flame, for example, has velocity components in three spatial directions to keep track of. It took years to strike upon the straightforward solution. “What we exploited was the locality of the interactions” in spatially extended chaotic systems, Pathak said. Locality means variables in one place are influenced by variables at nearby places but not by places far away. “By using that,” Pathak explained, “we can essentially break up the problem into chunks.” That is, you can parallelize the problem, using one reservoir of neurons to learn about one patch of a system, another reservoir to learn about the next patch, and so on, with slight overlaps of neighboring domains to account for their interactions. Parallelization allows the reservoir computing approach to handle chaotic systems of almost any size, as long as proportionate computer resources are dedicated to the task. If we have ignorance we should use the machine learning to fill in the gaps where the ignorance resides. Edward Ott Ott explained reservoir computing as a three-step procedure. Say you want to use it to predict the evolution of a spreading fire. First, you measure the height of the flame at five different points along the flame front, continuing to measure the height at these points on the front as the flickering flame advances over a period of time. You feed these data-streams in to randomly chosen artificial neurons in the reservoir. The input data triggers the neurons to fire, triggering connected neurons in turn and sending a cascade of signals throughout the network. The second step is to make the neural network learn the dynamics of the evolving flame front from the input data. To do this, as you feed data in, you also monitor the signal strengths of several randomly chosen neurons in the reservoir. Weighting and combining these signals in five different ways produces five numbers as outputs. The goal is to adjust the weights of the various signals that go into calculating the outputs until those outputs consistently match the next set of inputs—the five new heights measured a moment later along the flame front. “What you want is that the output should be the input at a slightly later time,” Ott explained. To learn the correct weights, the algorithm simply compares each set of outputs, or predicted flame heights at each of the five points, to the next set of inputs, or actual flame heights, increasing or decreasing the weights of the various signals each time in whichever way would have made their combinations give the correct values for the five outputs. From one time-step to the next, as the weights are tuned, the predictions gradually improve, until the algorithm is consistently able to predict the flame’s state one time-step later. “In the third step, you actually do the prediction,” Ott said. The reservoir, having learned the system’s dynamics, can reveal how it will evolve. The network essentially asks itself what will happen. Outputs are fed back in as the new inputs, whose outputs are fed back in as inputs, and so on, making a projection of how the heights at the five positions on the flame front will evolve. Other reservoirs working in parallel predict the evolution of height elsewhere in the flame. In a plot in their PRL paper, which appeared in January, the researchers show that their predicted flamelike solution to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation exactly matches the true solution out to eight Lyapunov times before chaos finally wins, and the actual and predicted states of the system diverge. The usual approach to predicting a chaotic system is to measure its conditions at one moment as accurately as possible, use these data to calibrate a physical model, and then evolve the model forward. As a ballpark estimate, you’d have to measure a typical system’s initial conditions 100,000,000 times more accurately to predict its future evolution eight times further ahead. The machine-learning technique is almost as good as knowing the truth. Holger Kantz That’s why machine learning is “a very useful and powerful approach,” said Ulrich Parlitz of the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in Göttingen, Germany, who, like Jaeger, also applied machine learning to low-dimensional chaotic systems in the early 2000s. “I think it’s not only working in the example they present but is universal in some sense and can be applied to many processes and systems.” In a paper soon to be published in Chaos, Parlitz and a collaborator applied reservoir computing to predict the dynamics of “excitable media,” such as cardiac tissue. Parlitz suspects that deep learning, while being more complicated and computationally intensive than reservoir computing, will also work well for tackling chaos, as will other machine-learning algorithms. Recently, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and ETH Zurich achieved similar results as the Maryland team using a “long short-term memory” neural network, which has recurrent loops that enable it to store temporary information for a long time. Since the work in their PRL paper, Ott, Pathak, Girvan, Lu and other collaborators have come closer to a practical implementation of their prediction technique. In new research accepted for publication in Chaos, they showed that improved predictions of chaotic systems like the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation become possible by hybridizing the data-driven, machine-learning approach and traditional model-based prediction. Ott sees this as a more likely avenue for improving weather prediction and similar efforts, since we don’t always have complete high-resolution data or perfect physical models. “What we should do is use the good knowledge that we have where we have it,” he said, “and if we have ignorance we should use the machine learning to fill in the gaps where the ignorance resides.” The reservoir’s predictions can essentially calibrate the models; in the case of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, accurate predictions are extended out to 12 Lyapunov times. The duration of a Lyapunov time varies for different systems, from milliseconds to millions of years. (It’s a few days in the case of the weather.) The shorter it is, the touchier or more prone to the butterfly effect a system is, with similar states departing more rapidly for disparate futures. Chaotic systems are everywhere in nature, going haywire more or less quickly. Yet strangely, chaos itself is hard to pin down. “It’s a term that most people in dynamical systems use, but they kind of hold their noses while using it,” said Amie Wilkinson, a professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago. “You feel a bit cheesy for saying something is chaotic,” she said, because it grabs people’s attention while having no agreed-upon mathematical definition or necessary and sufficient conditions. “There is no easy concept,” Kantz agreed. In some cases, tuning a single parameter of a system can make it go from chaotic to stable or vice versa. Wilkinson and Kantz both define chaos in terms of stretching and folding, much like the repeated stretching and folding of dough in the making of puff pastries. Each patch of dough stretches horizontally under the rolling pin, separating exponentially quickly in two spatial directions. Then the dough is folded and flattened, compressing nearby patches in the vertical direction. The weather, wildfires, the stormy surface of the sun and all other chaotic systems act just this way, Kantz said. “In order to have this exponential divergence of trajectories you need this stretching, and in order not to run away to infinity you need some folding,” where folding comes from nonlinear relationships between variables in the systems. The stretching and compressing in the different dimensions correspond to a system’s positive and negative “Lyapunov exponents,” respectively. In another recent paper in Chaos, the Maryland team reported that their reservoir computer could successfully learn the values of these characterizing exponents from data about a system’s evolution. Exactly why reservoir computing is so good at learning the dynamics of chaotic systems is not yet well understood, beyond the idea that the computer tunes its own formulas in response to data until the formulas replicate the system’s dynamics. The technique works so well, in fact, that Ott and some of the other Maryland researchers now intend to use chaos theory as a way to better understand the internal machinations of neural networks.

USA TODAY Police cars block a street leading to the Jacksonville Landing area in downtown Jacksonville on Aug. 26, 2018, in this image from TV station WJXT. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) JACKSONVILLE – Customers come to the Chicago Pizza and Sports Grille to sip beers, talk sports and indulge in deep-dish pies and other pub grub. On Sunday, the calm of a weekend afternoon at the riverfront hangout was shattered when gunfire ripped through the air and a stampede to escape ensued — many scrambling from a gaming parlor at the back of the restaurant. Witnesses described a harrowing scene before three people, including the gunman, were dead and 11 were injured in a storm of bullets. Braheem Johnson, a cook at the grill, caught a glimpse of the shooter, whom he described as a young male of average build who fired into the crowd using a large caliber handgun with a laser sight attachment. ""I just heard shots and I looked at the window and I see him,"" Johnson said. ""Dude came in there, basically like, to kill... He was just in his rampage mode."" Johnson barricaded himself and some customers in the restaurant and grabbed a pair of kitchen knives. ""If you come into this kitchen, you're bound to get stabbed,"" Johnson said he told the gunman. Sunday evening, Sheriff Mike Williams identified the shooter as David Katz, 24, of Baltimore. He said the FBI was searching the man’s home as part of the investigation.

Gamers sit in chairs in front of monitors with headsets to play popular games such as Fortnite or Madden NFL 19.

Kotaku Staff,"PC gamers have got a pretty great thing going. Interesting, experimental indie games? Yup. Complex strategy simulations? Totally. The shiniest, prettiest versions of big-budget console games? They get a lot of those, too. Let’s say you’ve recently joined the ranks of the PC elite. Which games should you install? Start with the ones in the video above, which we’ve listed below. There’s no shortage of ambition in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Geralt of Rivia’s latest adventure is massive, a world you can get lost in for hours and still have plenty to do. There’s a ton for die-hard Witcher fans to enjoy, but you don’t need to have played a Witcher game to enjoy the heck out of this one. While many games these days have sprawling landscapes, The Witcher 3 is utterly dense. Every nook and cranny is filled with memorable characters, clever writing, and rewards for curious players. The main story is as thrilling as it is emotionally draining, and the side quests are actually worth doing. Since its release in 2015, The Witcher 3 has gotten a ton of free updates and improvements along with two terrific paid expansions, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. The full experience is now even bigger, richer, and better than ever. A Good Match For: Open-world fans, especially those who enjoyed Skyrim but were disappointed by the combat. In The Witcher 3, fighting is nearly as enjoyable as exploration. Not a Good Match For: People who value their time and social life, anyone who wants a game they can finish in a handful of hours. Read our review. Watch it in action. Study our tips for the game, and catch up on The Witcher lore. Purchase From: Steam | GOG | Amazon | Wal-Mart | Best Buy | Gamestop In the six years since Civilization V came out, we managed to review it not once but twice. That’s how much these games lend themselves to playing and replaying, and Civ VI is no different. The latest entry adds a lot of new ideas to the Firaxis’s tried-and-true formula, and while some new ideas work better than others, the whole is as usual more than the sum of its parts. The mechanical tweaks and refinements are wrapped up in a subtle, board-game-like aesthetic that is as pleasing on your twentieth hour as it was on your tenth. We’ll be playing this game for years. A Good Match For: Civ fans, people who have never played a Civ game, basically anyone who doesn’t actively hate Civ. Not A Good Match For: Anyone who actively hates Civ. Read our review. Watch it in action. Study our tips for the game. Purchase From: Steam | Amazon | Wal-Mart | Best Buy | Gamestop In 2010, Square Enix launched Final Fantasy XIV Online, and it was just the worst—buggy, over-complicated, unfinished; a mess. The developers spent three years rebuilding the game from the ground up, and the end result is one of the finest massively multiplayer online role-playing games ever made. It’s everything fans love about Final Fantasy — lush artwork, strong story, gorgeous music — only bigger, all wrapped around a traditional MMO framework. It’s that Square Enix polish that sets it apart from its competitors, earning it a spot in this list. A Good Match For : Fans of fantasy role-playing video games looking to take the massively multiplayer plunge. The original Final Fantasy XIV was a tangled mess of conflicting ideas, when all players wanted was a standard MMO game with the familiar features of a Final Fantasy game. That’s exactly what A Realm Reborn is. Not a Good Match For: Folks afraid of monthly subscriptions. Despite the MMORPG genere as a whole moving towards free-to-play payment models, Final Fantasy XIV stands firm by its monthly subscription plan. Read our review. Watch it in action. Purchase From: Amazon | Steam In Hitman, a simple setup paves the way for an unusually complex game. You enter a level with a target. You can eliminate that target in any way you see fit. Maybe you’re in a Paris fashion show, maybe you’re in the market outside a Moroccan embassy. Maybe you’re in a sprawling Italian villa, maybe a posh Bangkok hotel. Wherever you are, you’ll likely be impressed by Hitman ’s painstakingly detailed clockwork communities as they tick along, inviting you to explore and exploit them. The main story assassinations are the tip of the iceberg here, as repeatable escalations, player-made challenges, and miss-and-you-fail elusive targets round out a supremely satisfying collection of sneaking, costumery, and espionage challenges. Yes, Blood Money was great, but this new Hitman represents a pinnacle for the series. A Good Match For: Fans of classic spy movies, people who like playing dress-up, meticulous folks who love hatching a plan. Not A Good Match For: People hoping for a good straight-up action or straight-up stealth game— Hitman has elements of both but is kind of its own thing. Read our review. Watch it in action. Purchase From: Steam, boxed game coming early 2017 You’re alone on an island, surrounded by puzzles. That’s The Witness, an extremely complicated game that is really very simple. Some of the puzzles are obvious: They’re on screens right in front of you, stacked in orderly rows. Other puzzles are much less easy to find. All of them will stymie and confound you, but over time you’ll gradually dismantle them until the game’s grand design is laid out in front of you like the workings of a finely crafted watch. Some games make you level up your character to access new areas; this one makes you level up yourself. There are few more satisfying feelings in gaming than when you finally realize the solution to a puzzle in The Witness. With a click, a new door opens. A Good Match For: Puzzle fiends, people who like a challenge, anyone who liked Myst and wants to see what a modern evolution would be like. Not A Good Match For: Anyone wanting action, the easily frustrated, people who don’t like puzzles in games and generally just go look up the answers. Read our review. Watch it in action. Study our tips for the game. Purchase From: Steam | Humble Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a supremely entertaining and consistently surprising role-playing game, one that expands and improves upon almost everything about its already fantastic predecessor. It may appear to be just another rote fantasy world at first blush, but the more you explore, the more interesting it becomes. Between the complex and rewarding turn-based combat and the branching, open-ended quests and side-stories, Original Sin 2 gives players an uncommon level of freedom to tell their own stories. And that’s not to mention the elaborate Game Master mode, which lets you write and build campaigns for your friends to work through together. Time and again you’ll find yourself trying outlandish things just to see if they’ll work. Most of the time, they will. A Good Match For: Anyone who liked the first game, fans of the Ultima series and other similar CRPGs from which Divinity draws inspiration. Not A Good Match For: Anyone hoping for a more action-packed RPG, those who don’t like complicated or challenging games. Read our review. Watch it in action. Purchase From: Steam | GOG It’s a fan-art generator. It’s pure cosplay fodder. It’s a meme machine, a water-cooler mainstay, and a cultural obsession. Overwatch is all of those things, but above all else it’s a finely tuned competitive video game that manages to encourage pitted competition and enthusiastic teamwork while ensuring everyone is having a good time. A Good Match For: Team Fortress 2 fans, people who liked banging action figures together as a kid, people who’ve wanted to try a competitive first-person shooter but haven’t yet found the right fit. Not A Good Match For: Anyone who wants to play offline, or who is hoping for a substantial single-player story campaign. Overwatch is strictly multiplayer-only. Watch it in action. Study our tips for the game. Read our review. Purchase From: Blizzard | Amazon | Best Buy | Wal-Mart | Gamestop Just a man and a dog, looking to make a delivery. That’s how it all begins, anyway. But Kentucky Route Zero quickly becomes a mystical adventure through a land left behind by time, an odyssey in magical realism that feels grand and mysterious in a way that very, very few modern video games can muster. It’s not like anything you’ve ever played, and for that alone, you should play it. A Good Match For: Anyone looking for something different. Those who still believe there’s magic hidden somewhere off the interstate. Not A Good Match For: Those looking for a bunch of complex game mechanics— Kentucky Route Zero is a point-and-click adventure game, and a fairly simple one at that. Also, not for those who want closure—the five-act series is only on act three, and there tends to be a long wait between chapters. Watch a video about why the game is great. Purchase From: Amazon | Steam | Humble The first Total War: Warhammer was a very good strategy game. The sequel is even better, with so many improvements it feels like an all-new game. The map is one of the best maps we’ve seen in a Total War game, with a focus on winning using interesting non-human races. It’s less about the tried-and-true Total War steamroller approach of conquering as much of the map as possible, and more about performing smart, surgical strikes to proceed. A thinking person’s RTS, and an unexpectedly grand introduction to the Warhammer universe. A Good Match For: Total War fans, Warhammer fans, people who aren’t into Warhammer but think they could be. Not A Good Match For: Those who’ve tried Total War games in the past and just can’t get into them. Read our review. Watch it in action. Purchase From: Amazon | Steam Crusader Kings II began, in 2012, as a very good game. It has become, following a seemingly endless run of expansions and updates, each one adding new challenges, scope and dimensions to an already exhaustive package, one of the most comprehensive and unique strategic experiences in all of video games. A Good Match For: History buffs, anyone who knows that kingdoms rise and fall on much more than the strength of their armies. Not A Good Match For: Anyone looking for a simple game; Crusader Kings 2 is notoriously opaque and it’ll take you a while to wrap your head around it. Watch it in action. Read our review. Purchase From: Paradox | Steam | GOG Undertale might look like a retro-style JRPG, but it’s unusually forward-thinking. As a human stuck in a world of monsters, you decide whether you want to win encounters with wanton violence or clever context-based interactions (talking, joking, petting, etc). Undertale keeps track of everything you do; it’s paying very close attention, and will often express that attention in surprising ways. Every life you take ultimately has consequences. Despite those grim trappings, Undertale can be an incredibly warm, fuzzy, and funny game. Whether you slaughter or befriend everyone (or walk a middle path), the writing in this game is top-tier, the soundtrack is second-to-none, and the plot hides a treasure trove of secrets that players still haven’t fully uncovered. A Good Match For: Lovers of smart video game stories, fans of games that subvert expectations, people who’ve ever felt even a single pang of loneliness. Not A Good Match For: People who hate shoot-’em-ups and tough boss battles (Undertale’s combat system has elements of both), those who aren’t fond of reading dialogue, haters of lo-fi pixel art. Read our review. Watch it in action. Purchase From: Steam | GOG | Developer’s Site XCOM 2 refines or overhauls almost every little thing about 2012’s XCOM: Enemy Unknown, a game that was already good enough to win Kotaku ’s 2012 Game of the Year award. The game is meaner and faster than its predecessor; most missions have timers that push you forward and force you to take risks, and the new alien types will break even your most time-tested strategies. You’ll get more attached to your team of customizable soldiers than ever, which makes it all the harder to watch them die horribly in the field. Watch out for the snakes, man. The snakes are the worst. A Good Match For: Strategy fans, people who liked the first game, anyone who’s ever wanted to understand just how difficult it is to fight off an occupying force from the inside out. Not A Good Match For: The easily frustrated, those looking for a simple game, anyone who rages at missing point-blank shots due to dice rolls.

Purchase From: Steam | Amazon | Wal-Mart | Best Buy | Gamestop The games on this list are all great PC games. But of all the platforms in our collection of The Bests, the PC has been around the longest and therefore has the largest back catalogue. There are decades of fantastic PC games to choose from, and if you own a PC you’d be remiss if you didn’t go through the classics and play the best ones. Thankfully, we’ve got two lists to help you out. In 2013 our readers helped us make an exhaustive megalist of the best classic PC games of all time. Then in 2015, we made our own list of the 24 best classic PC games. How has this list changed? Read back through our update history: Update 11/10/2017: Another update our trickiest list: we’ve added Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Total War: Warhammer II while removing Doom and Inside. Update 12/2/2016: Big changes come to the PC list! We’ve added DOOM, Inside, Hitman, and Civilization VI while removing MGSV, StarCraft 2, Divinity: Original Sin and Civilization V. Update 6/24/2016: Crusader Kings II and Overwatch make it onto the list, while Total War: Shogun 2 and Portal 2 exit. Rest easy, Wheatley. You had a good run. Update 2/22/2016: We’ve added XCOM 2 and The Witness and removed Heroes of the Storm and XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Update 10/29/2015: The list gets another shake-up. We’ve added Metal Gear Solid V, Undertale, and Divinity: Original Sin: Enhanced Edition in the place of Counter-Strike GO, Minecraft, and Pillars of Eternity. Update 7/22/2015: We’ve shaken the list up with three new entries: Pillars of Eternity, The Witcher 3 and Heroes of the Storm take the place of Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim and DOTA 2. Update 11/25/2014: Fall 2014 brings with it a single swap: Dragon Age: Inquisition knocks off its predecessor Dragon Age: Origins. (Though you should still probably play Origins if you haven’t, because it’s really good.) Update 8/6/2014: The list gets a shake-up: say goodbye to Half Life 2, Titanfall and Gone Home and hello to Dota 2, Counter-Strike: GO and Kentucky Route Zero. We’ve also reset the comments to allow for new debate and discussion. Update 4/10/14: We’ve called in an orbital drop and replaced Battlefield 3 with Titanfall. Update 12/9/13: At the end of the year comes a sizable update to the PC bests list. Gone are FTL, The Witcher 2, Team Fortress 2 and Far Cry 3 and in their place are Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Dragon Age: Origins, Gone Home and Portal 2. Update 07/24/13: It’s a long overdue update for the PC platform, with four games leaving and four coming onto the list. Skyrim —which was out when this list debuted—jumps onto the Bests because of the post-release addition of Steam Workshop, which lets you seamlessly access and install hundreds of the awesome mods available for the game. It’s joined by XCOM: Enemy Unknown, FTL and Far Cry 3. Wave good-bye to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Dirt 2, Mass Effect 2 and Bejeweled 3. Want more of the best games on each system?

Conrad Anker,"Editors note: This guest post comes from a rock climber and adventurer who used Google Earth to aid his quest to explore Antarctica's remote Queen Maud Land with other athletes from The North Face team. Nearly twenty-two years ago, my late friend Alex Lowe, Jon Krakauer and I huddled over a stack of tattered Norwegian maps from the International Geophysical Year, 1957 - 58. These were the first maps of Antarctica's remote Queen Maud Land, a stark glacial landscape dotted with impossibly jagged granite spires protruding from thousands of feet of ice. As we scanned the only detailed account of this faraway land, the complex and cryptic landscape made it blatantly obvious why these were some of the last unclimbed peaks on earth. Back in 98, our paper maps were a static window into this dynamic land. We peeked in with trepidation, knowing that once we arrived on the ice cap, our lives would depend on rough estimations and ballpark figures, which still left a lot to chance. How many days would it take to reach the towers from our base camp? What if a storm pinned us down? What if we were unable to cross a dangerously crevassed part of the glacier? Two decades later, the same thirst for pushing limits in the face of the unknown is calling me back to Queen Maud Land. This time the adventure began with my family in the comfort of our living room in Bozeman, Montanaour paper maps are replaced with smartphones and laptops. With Google Earth, my family was able to explore Queen Maud Land with me before my boots ever touched the ground.

We Are The Mighty,"A US sailor fires a shot line from amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard to the fleet replenishment oiler USNS Yukon for underway replenishment, July 1, 2013 Petty Officer 3rd Class MICHAEL ACHTERLINGS When the Navy announced plans to retire a system in August of 2018, not a lot of media outlets paid attention. Despite its failure to make headlines, the system that's on the way out is actually one of the most important in the Navy. We're talking, of course, about the Standard Automated Logistics Tool Set, or SALTS. Developed in the space of just three weeks during the run-up to Operation Desert Storm, this system has been with the Navy for 27 years — and it makes sure that the personnel in the fight have what they need by rapidly moving data on required parts and available inventory to and from the battlefield electronically. There is an old saying, ""amateurs discuss tactics and strategy, while professionals talk logistics."" Think of it this way: How can the pilot of a F/A-18E Super Hornet be expected to blow an enemy MiG out of the sky if his radar doesn't work? Yes, launching skilled pilots on the right mission at the right time is critically important, but nothing happens if the moving pieces aren't in order. The fighters on a carrier, for instance, need spare parts to work (just like your car). US Navy It's not just the super-complex fighters. Even the M16 rifles and M4 carbines used by SEALs will need spare parts or replacement magazines (which are often ejected and left behind in firefights) — not to mention ammo. Then there are the many other needs of the Navy: Food for the sailors, fuel to keep ships and planes running, the list goes on and on. SALTS enabled sailors on the front to handle Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) in minutes as opposed to weeks or days. It also could fix some mistakes in seconds. Not bad for a solution that was designed and implemented in three weeks. SALTS, though, was running up against advancing computer technology and new cyber-security threats. There is a new system known as One Touch Support, or OTS, that will take over for SALTS. And yes, just like its predecessor, OTS isn't likely to make headlines, but will play a crucial role for the Navy.","Petty Officer 3rd Class MICHAEL ACHTERLINGS When the Navy announced plans to retire a system in August of 2018, not a lot of media outlets paid attention.

Eliza Relman,"President Donald Trump at a rally in Tampa Bay, Florida on Tuesday. Evan Vucci/AP At a rally in Tampa Bay, Florida on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump was surrounded by cheering supporters, some of whom were decked out in T-shirts emblazoned with the letter ""Q"" and holding signs reading ""We are Q."" The paraphernalia refers to a set of pro-Trump, right-wing conspiracy theories known as ""QAnon,"" which hold that a cabal of elites, including celebrities, Democratic Party leaders, and the deep state, are the source of all evil and that Trump — with help from secret allies including special counsel Robert Mueller — will expose and defeat these forces. How 'QAnon' emerged In October 2017, an anonymous person who claims to have access to top-secret information (and a so-called Q-level government security clearance), began posting cryptic messages on an online message board known as 4Chan. The vague notes are written in poem-like verses, which ""QAnon"" followers call ""breadcrumbs,"" or clues to understanding Trump's secret counter-coup against evil. Followers believe there will be a ""Great Awakening"" before a ""storm"" — an idea derived from the president's unclear reference last year to "" the calm before the storm "" — during which Trump will conquer elites, globalists, and the deep state. And Democrats including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will ultimately find themselves locked up in Guantanamo. The complex set of interwoven theories revolve largely around promoting a positive interpretation of Trump's leadership, and they're infested with racism and anti-Semitism. 'QAnon' in the mainstream The conspiracy has in recent months worked its way from the radical fringes of the internet to mainstream platforms, including Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit. Celebrities with well-known right-wing beliefs, including comedian and disgraced actress Roseanne Barr and former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling, have appeared to endorse the group on Twitter. Barr used the ""QAnon"" slogan, ""Where we go one we go all,"" abbreviated to ""WWG1WGA,"" in her message. ""QAnon"" followers have begun to make public appearances. In April, hundreds marched in Washington to protest the Department of Justice. And in June, a Trump supporter at a rally in Duluth, Minnesota wearing a shirt emblazoned with the QAnon logo was given VIP access. During the rally, Trump approached the man in the ""Q"" shirt and gestured towards him. The group's supporters took the incident as evidence of the theory's validity. On Tuesday, ""QAnon"" followers made a strong showing at Trump's Florida rally, prompting reporters and others in attendence to document their presence. It is unclear whether the president knows about QAnon or is aware that some of his supporters subscribe to the group. When asked at a Wednesday press briefing whether the president ""encourages the support"" of QAnon members, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump ""condemns and denounces any group that would incite violence against anoter individual and certainly doesn't support groups that would promote that kind of behavior."" But the president has long promoted conspiracy theories, including the ""birther"" conspiracy about Obama's place of birth.","Believers in the ""QAnon"" conspiracy theories are increasingly making their presence known offline, including at President Donald Trump's campaign rallies.

At least six deaths have been confirmed from the hurricane, according to the Washington Post. Four were tallied in Gadsden County, west of Tallahassee, according to CNN. One of the victims included a man who died after a tree fell on his home. In Iredell County in North Carolina, a 38-year-old man was killed when a tree fell on a vehicle, according to the Post. In Seminole County, Georgia, an 11-year-old girl died when the winds ripped a carport off the ground and threw it into the house where she sat right next to her grandmother, striking her head. Elizabeth Hanson, right, and her daughter survey their damaged home on Oct. 11, 2018 in Mexico Beach, Florida. One major point of concern for officials had been the hospitals, which are particularly in need of electricity. They had reason to worry: Emergency officials have evacuated more than 300 patients from storm-damaged hospitals in Panama City, according to the New York Times. Five hospitals total have been closed in the region, along with 11 nursing facilities. After Hurricane Irma, which walloped Southern Florida last year, 11 people died from heat-related causes in a nursing home that lost power. Several nursing homes and hospitals in the region are currently operating on generator power. Hurricane Michael is one of the strongest storms to ever hit the United States, and it destroyed entire blocks of homes when it made landfall in Mexico Beach yesterday.

Mexico Beach, at the epicenter of the hurricanes destructive path, saw winds crush entire neighborhoods, and the storm surge swept away entire blocks of homes. Authorities said that 285 people in the city had refused or been unable to evacuate. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said 20 people were rescued from Mexico Beach overnight Wednesday, and he urged those who had evacuated from coastal areas not to try to return until search-and-rescue teams had completed their work. Tom Bailey walks his bike past a home that was carried across a road and slammed up against a condo complex on Oct. 11, 2018 in Mexico Beach, Florida. Michael, now a tropical storm, was the most powerful storm to hit Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, just shy of a Category 5 but still the third-most powerful hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. on record. It is expected to cross the Carolinas and leave the coast by early Friday. Virginia declared a state of emergency Thursday, joining Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, and North Carolina in having done so. Meanwhile, President Trump approved disaster requests for Georgia and Florida to allow federal authorities to coordinate response efforts. As rescuers move into more devastated areas along the coast and sort through more debris, the death toll is expected to rise.

Gwenael P,"Either to represent a workflow, configure an environment, or set up a visual programming tool; diagrams can be an important part of your toolbox. Today, I want to focus on a library to create complex, highly customizable diagrams for your React apps. [Todays random Sourcerer profile: https://sourcerer.io/pablordrrbl ] React-diagrams offers advanced diagram visualizations for your project. You will be able to display boxes with titles and properties, and links that are connecting those properties. Links can be drawn as curves, or you can specify anchor points to make the connection between the two properties a serie of segments. Diagrams can be controled by the user. You can move nodes, links, create links between nodes, move and scale the viewport. This library is really customizable, you can customize nearly every part of the rendered diagram, handle events to attach behaviours on clicking on elements or other user interactions. Repository: https://github.com/projectstorm/react-diagrams Demo: http://projectstorm.cloud/react-diagrams Docs: https://projectstorm.gitbooks.io/react-diagrams To install this library, you first need to install it into your React application Via yarn yarn install storm-react-diagrams Via npm npm install storm-react-diagrams Then, import it and use it in your React app, in the component that will encapsulate your diagram : import * as SRD from ""storm-react-diagrams"" require(""storm-react-diagrams/dist/style.min.css"") Once this step is done, you will be able to access all that you need to create a fully functionnal diagram, under the namespace SRD : You can then render it with the following JSX code : &lt;SRD.DiagramWidget diagramEngine={engine} /&gt; There you have a classy diagram! First, lets have a look at the factory pattern used to create new diagram nodes. This pattern allows the library to be built around design patterns such as factories, that make the system highly configurable. Lets see this more in details, and take one example from their Storybook as an introduction to these concepts. In this example we want to draw a diamond shaped node, as shown in this screenshot : Right after registering default factories from the diagram, we will declare two new factories. This will teach the diagram engine how to draw diamond shaped nodes, and register this new node in the diagram engine. You will then be able to declare nodes of type diamond. Event handling allows you to define custom behaviours when interacting with diagrams and execute them when interacting with it. This step is quite easy to reproduce : var node = new DefaultNodeModel(""Node 3"", ""rgb(128,99,255)""); node.addListener({ selectionChanged: () =&gt; { console.log(""selectionChanged"") } }); This example shows how to bind events to a node model, but you can also bind events to link models and to the main diagram model. Events for the diagram model nodesUpdated linksUpdated offsetUpdated zoomUpdated gridUpdated selectionChanged entityRemoved Events for Link models sourcePortChanged targetPortChanged selectionChanged entityRemoved Events for Node models and Point models selectionChanged entityRemoved By assigning smartRouting={true} to the main diagram component, you can display diagram links that are straight segments, automatically avoiding displayed nodes. At any time you can use a serialization method to export your dragram in JSON using the serializeDiagram method on your diagram model. You can then restore a previously saved diagram using the deSerializeDiagram method on the same diagram model. Full example available here. Dagre is a library used to reorder diagrams visually. It will reorganize your diagram to make it readable. This library can work with any diagram libraries and tools, as long as you can retreive positions of your elements and move them programmatically. A full example on how to bind it to storm-react-diagrams is available here. This library is really simple to use if you think about what is going on under the hood. Generate interactive diagrams is usually not an easy task, and adding customization abilities usually adds a burden to the API that can become really hard to understand. React-diagrams does really well in that sense, and expose whats necessary to the developer when it is necessary to him. The implementation work has been done in an elegant way and it is really pleasant to use it. However, one thing which is currently missing (from my point of view) is the ability to setup diagrams directly from the template, using components. This could be an optional, less complex and less customizable way to implement a diagram. Such ideas have already been seen on other components, so why not? Concerning under the hood remarks, the library uses div elements to render nodes, and groups all links rendering into a SVG element. This way of rendering diagrams can be questionable, but the developer already answered this question here, stating that he runned into several issues with SVG. The project is really active on Github. It received numerous pull request since its beginning, and both author and contributors are really active on issues. Lots of discussions are happening to propose new features or even to make it more simple to use. Versioning is also well maintained, as well as changelog and documentation (some more API documentation could be appreciated, but you can also have a look at examples ). If you want to achieve the same goals with vanilla Javascript, I would advise you to take a look at this post, comparing various libraries that would help you implement interactive diagrams in your project. Using Vue.js, I did not find any library that was doing the job correctly, so I started to create one on my own. It is far from complete though. If you have any alternative for other framework (I did not find anything for Angular yet), feel free to help me complete that list on the comments!","Either to represent a workflow, configure an environment, or set up a visual programming tool; diagrams can be an important part of your…",2018-10-08T00:49:58Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sourcerer.io'}",Build interactive diagrams with storm-react-diagrams,https://blog.sourcerer.io/build-interactive-diagrams-with-storm-react-diagrams-f172ae26af9d,https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*1XSFpnd0Gcocvj9SCm_P8w.jpeg,,Sourcerer.io,storm complex,1
Sidney Fussell,"A new browser tool lets Spotify Premium users fool around with the music streaming platform’s famous recommendation algorithm. Arielle Vaniderstine, an engineer at the company, posted a link to Glitch on Monday of a beta build of the tool. Called “Nelson,” the tool displays several sliders representing the “audio features” that inform the algorithm. From there, users can play around with the sliders, manually altering the inputs. You select a few genres, which features to change, and out comes a recommendation playlist. Here’s Spotify’s explanation of the various elements, as quoted by The Verge : Acousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic. Danceability: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. Energy: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal.” The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0. Liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live. Speechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. Tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. Valence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). It might seem complex, but just remember that musical taste is itself a sort of equation made up of similar variables. You might not think in terms of “valence” or “energy,” but, broadly speaking, when you’re getting a feel for a new song, you’re probably paying attention to whether you can dance to it, and whether it’s uptempo or slower. The browser tool just takes the way Spotify quantifies these elements, then lets you play around with them. For me, it seemed like a cool way to explore outside my own musical tastes. I listen to a lot of upbeat pop and I like singers with big voices. With Nelson, I can try a different genre, let’s say metal, then ask Spotify to recommend me metal songs that are both fast-paced and heavy on vocals. For those that want to go further into Spotify’s algorithm, the beta Developer site lets you look up the audio features for individual tracks. “ After the Storm ” from Kali Uchis is a great, throwback R&amp;B slow jam. Computers don’t know what any of those descriptors mean, so here’s how Spotify quantifies a throwback R&amp;B slow jam: ""danceability"": 0.589, ""energy"": 0.912, ""key"": 9, ""loudness"": -3.748, ""mode"": 0, ""speechiness"": 0.0472, ""acousticness"": 0.000245, ""instrumentalness"": 0.00167, ""liveness"": 0.571, ""valence"": 0.579, ""tempo"": 99.995, ""type"": ""audio_features"", I took the values, fooled around with sliders, and tried to become my own manual recommendation algorithm. Keeping the values the same while switching up the genre made for some surprising recommendations, like Ministry’s “ You Know What You Are ” and Liam Gallagher’s “ Wall of Glass.” We now live in a world full of algorithmic feeds and recommendation rabbit holes, making Nelson a fun time-waster that’s also a cool look behind the behind the scenes, showing how the digital sausage is made.

AFP,"Beira (Mozambique): More than a thousand people are feared to have died in a cyclone that smashed into Mozambique last week, while scores were killed and more than 200 are missing in neighbouring Zimbabwe.The city of Beira in central Mozambique bore Cyclone Idai's full wrath on Thursday before the storm barrelled on to neighbouring Zimbabwe, unleashing fierce winds and flash floods and washing away roads and houses.
""For the moment we have registered 84 deaths officially, but when we flew over the area... this morning to understand what's going on, everything indicates that we could register more than 1,000 deaths,"" Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said in a nationwide address. 
 ""This is a real humanitarian disaster,"" he said. 
""More than 100,000 people are in danger"".Survivors have taken refuge in trees while awaiting help, the president added.
Aerial photographs released by a Christian non-profit organisation, the Mission Aviation Fellowship, showed groups of people stuck on rooftops with flood waters up to window level.
""The scale of damage... (in) Beira is massive and horrifying"", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said.
Ninety per cent of the city of some 530,000 people and its surrounding area has been ""damaged or destroyed,"" it said in a statement.
""The situation is terrible. The scale of devastation is enormous,"" the IFRC's Jamie LeSueur said.
""Almost everything is destroyed. Communication lines have been completely cut and roads have been destroyed. Some affected communities are not accessible."" 
A large dam burst on Sunday and cut off the last road to Beira, he said.
Sofala province governor Alberto Mondlane warned that the ""biggest threat we have now, even bigger than the cyclone, is floods because it's raining more and more"".
Emma Beaty, coordinator of a grouping of NGOs known as Cosaco, said: ""We've never had something of this magnitude before in Mozambique"".
""Some dams have broken, and others have reached full capacity, they'll very soon open the flood gates. It's a convergence of flooding, cyclones, dams breaking and making a potential wave: everything's in place so we get a perfect storm."" 
Nyusi said the Pungwe and Buzi rivers in central Mozambique ""have burst their banks and engulfed entire villages."" 
""Communities are isolated and bodies are floating"" on the waters, he said.
Beira international airport was closed because of cyclone damage but later reopened.
In neighbouring Zimbabwe, Idai left 98 dead and at least 217 more missing, according to the information ministry.
Families started burying their dead on Monday in damp graves, according to an AFP photographer.
The storm swept away homes and ripped bridges to pieces, leaving destruction that acting defence minister Perrance Shiri said ""resembles the aftermath of a full-scale war"".
Some roads were swallowed up by massive sinkholes, while bridges were ripped to pieces by flash floods.
""This is the worst infrastructural damage we have ever had,"" Zimbabwe's Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Joel Biggie Matiza said.
The eastern district of Chimanimani was worst-hit, with houses and most of the region's bridges washed away by flash floods.
The most affected areas are not yet accessible, and high winds and dense clouds have hampered military rescue helicopter flights.
Two pupils and a worker at a secondary school in the area were among those killed after a landslide sent a boulder crashing into their dormitory.
Soldiers on Sunday helped rescue the surviving nearly 200 pupils, teachers and staff who had been trapped at the school in Chimanimani.Joshua Sacco, lawmaker for Chimanimani, told AFP that ""150 to 200 people"" are missing.
The majority of them are thought to be government workers, whose housing complex was completely engulfed by raging waters. Their fate was unknown because the area was still unreachable.
Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa cut short a visit to Abu Dhabi, returning home on Monday.
""With every hour and day that passes, our worst fears become increasingly real,"" he said in a statement. 
""Many drowned while others were killed in their sleep from swift and unexpected rockfalls which demolished their homes"".
His government has come under fire for failing to evacuate people in time.

Aarian Marshall,"Everyone working in the autonomous vehicle space said it was inevitable. In America—and in the rest of the world—cars kill people, around 40,000 in the US and 1.25 million in the globe each year. High speeds, metal boxes. Self-driving cars would be better. But no one promised perfection. Eventually, they’d hurt someone. Still, the death of Elaine Herzberg, struck by a self-driving Uber in Tempe, Arizona, two weeks ago, felt like a shock. Even more so after the Tempe Police Department released a video of the incident, showing both the exterior view—a low-quality dash cam captured the victim suddenly emerging from darkness on the side of the road—and the interior view displaying Uber’s safety driver, the woman hired to watch and then take control of the vehicle if the technology failed, looking away from the road. But the shock cut in different ways. Most of the world say the video and thought, gee, that crash looked inevitable. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Tempe’s police chief even suggested as much. “It’s very clear it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode (autonomous or human-driven) based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway,” Chief Sylvia Moir said. (The police department later said some of Moir’s comments were “taken out of context.”) But autonomous vehicle developers were disturbed. Many experts say the car should have picked up on a pedestrian in a wide-open roadway, after she had already crossed a wide-open lane. “I think the sensors on the vehicles should have seen the pedestrian well in advance,” Steven Shladover, a UC Berkeley research engineer, told WIRED. “This is one that should have been straightforward.” Something went wrong here. That divide—between a public used to the very particular foibles of human drivers, and the engineers building self-driving technology—is a really important one, because Uber’s self-driving crash will not be the last. As companies like General Motors, Ford, Aptiv, Zoox, and Waymo continue to test their vehicles on public roads, there will be more dust-ups, fender-benders, and yes, crashes that maim and kill. “The argument is that the rate of accidents is supposed to go down, when autonomy is matured to a certain level,” says Mike Wagner, co-founder and CEO of Edge Case Research, which helps robotics companies build more robust software. “But how we get from here to there is not always entirely clear, especially if it needs a lot of on-road testing.” As companies work out bugs and fiddle with their machine learning algorithms, expect these vehicles to mess up in peculiar ways. Crashes that look unavoidable will be the ones this tech is built to prevent. Maneuvers that seem easy to people will stump the robots. Someday soon, self-driving cars could be much, much safer than human drivers. But in the meantime, it’s helpful to understand how these vehicles work—and the strange ways in which they go wrong. Sensors Sensors are self-driving car's “eyes”—they help the vehicle understand what’s around them. Cameras are nice for picking up on lane lines and signs, but they capture data in 2-D. Radars are cheap, great over long distances, and can “see” around some barriers, but don't offer much detail. That’s where lidar comes in. The laser sensor uses pulses of light to paint a 3-D picture of the world around it. The lidar Uber used, from a company called Velodyne, is viewed by many as the best system on the market right now. (At around $80,000, it’s also one of the most expensive.) But even the best lidar works a bit like the game Battleship. The laser pulses have to land on enough parts of the object to provide a detailed understanding of its shape, and do it within a few seconds. Ideally, that gives the sensor an accurate reading of the world, the kind of well-informed, on target guess that might help one player sink (or in this case, avoid) another’s fleet. But it’s possible, especially if the vehicle is moving at high speed, that the lasers don’t land on the right things. This might be especially true, experts say, if an object is moving perpendicular to the vehicle, like Herzberg was. This will sound strange for human drivers, who are much more likely to see a person or a bicycle when their full forms are revealed in profile. But when there’s less consistent perspective—when an object is moving second by second—it’s harder for the system to interpret and classify what’s doing the moving. Classification And classification is key. These systems “learn” about the world via machine learning systems, which must be fed a gigantic dataset of road images—curbs, pedestrians, cyclists, lane lanes—before they can identify objects on their own. But the system can go wrong. It’s possible Uber engineers somehow flubbed the machine learning process, and that the self-driving car software interpreted a pedestrian and her bike as a plastic bag or piece of cardboard. Even little things have been observed to fool these systems, like a few patches of tape on a stop sign. Self-driving cars have also been known to see shimmering exhaust as solid objects. Wagner, who has studied this problem, discovered that one system that could not see through certain kinds of weather—even if objects were still totally visible to the human eye. “If there were the the tiniest amount of fog, the neural network lost them,” he says. If the classification is off, the system’s predictions might be off, too. These systems expect humans to move in specific ways, and plastic bags to move in another. Those sorts of predictions could have been botched, too. If classification is the problem, Uber might have to collect additional hundreds of thousands of images to retrain their system. The Software Or crashes like Uber's could be caused by bugs. Autonomous vehicles run off hundreds of thousands of lines of code. An engineer could have introduced some problem, somewhere. Or maybe the system erroneously discarded sensor data it should have used to ID and then evade the woman. Likely, this crash and future crashes will be combinations of many things. “My guess is this is the outcome of complex sequence of things that have never happened before,” says Raj Rajkumar, who studies autonomous systems at Carnegie Mellon University. In other words: a perfect storm. One system failed, then its backup failed, too. The final fail-safe, the system that’s supposed to kick in at the last moment to prevent any dangers, failed, too. That was the human safety driver. “One of the processes of building a robot that has to do real things is that real things are incredibly complicated and hard to understand,” says Wagner. Robots don’t understand eye contact or waves or nods. They might think random things are walls or bushes or paper bags. Their mistakes will seem mysterious to the human eye, and alarming. But those developing the tech persist—because getting drunk, sleepy, or distracted will seem mysterious to the robots.

From there, strapped into a rover, you rock and lurch over steep, bumpy terrain toward your base camp, marked on a display by a distant yellow circle whose coordinates you radio to teammates in Mission Control. Inside this new simulator at the Kennedy Space Visitor Complex, your training to become a Mars astronaut has begun. “We ran into some rocks, but that’s OK,” said 10-year-old Ali Natt of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., after completing a simulated drive on the Red Planet. “It was really fun.” More: Latest delay of tests on NASA Mars rocket draws congressional fire More: What we learned from Elon Musk's speech about Mars, moon base More: Psychology experiment kept six NASA subjects isolated on a Mars-like volcano for 8 months Natt, the rover pilot, and friend Gracy Fraysure, the commander, were among the first group of guests to tour the Visitor Complex’s revamped, Mars-focused Astronaut Training Experience, or ATX. After Monday’s “soft opening,” a grand opening is planned Feb. 6. The new ATX is located on the Visitor Complex’s main campus, where Early Space Exploration and the Angry Birds Space Encounter used to be. It will replace programs now hosted across the river at the former site of the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame. Those programs were based on the space shuttle. Given that NASA retired the shuttle in 2011, they were in need of an update. “We’re looking at training astronauts to go into deep space,” said Dee Maynard, education manager for the Visitor Complex. “Mars is definitely a goal that NASA is pursuing and it captures the imagination and the heart.” Two years in the making, the new ATX features three simulators and Mars Base Camp 1, activities that could take less than an hour or an entire day. The cost: a minimum of $30 or $40 for the two simulators open now to guests age 10 or older, on top of the Visitor Complex’s base ticket price. A pair of full-motion rover simulators are the closest thing to a theme park ride in the ATX portfolio, capable of spinning two passengers upside down on the most intense setting. They come with warnings to those prone to motion sickness. A preview of the new Astronaut Training Experience Center and Mars Base 1 at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.

(Photo: TIM SHORTT/ FLORIDA TODAY) Next to the simulators in the hangar-like Training Control Center is “Walk on Mars,” where participants don virtual reality headsets and use controllers to complete various tasks. “You want to go northeast … stop,” 12-year-old Titusville resident C’hi Stinnett radioed from a console to her virtual reality partner, 41-year-old Samantha Thorstensen of Melbourne. “Good. That’s a rock. Pick it up.” Obscured behind a black curtain, Thorstensen swiveled and stooped in response to Stinnett’s instructions. The virtual Mars walkers — up to four at a time in up to four different environments — blew dust off rocks and soil samples and collected them in test tubes. They took shelter in a rover when a dust storm approached, then had to repair the damaged rover. The partners’ combined skill and efficiency produced scores of up to five stars. Many guests found they’d only earned one or two on the first try. A third simulator mimics a spacewalk performing maintenance on an International Space Station girder. Spacewalkers buckle into a seat — “It looks like a dentist’s chair, but it’s not that bad,” a trainer joked — and clip on a helmet with a visor. With a whoosh, a hose pumps a cushion of air allowing the “friction-less” chair to glide over the floor, simulating reduced gravity. Instructions and tools are provided to tighten bolts, open and close valves or unplug a Common Electronics Module. 12 year old C'hi Stinnett of Titusville participates in a simulation where she had to guide a teammate during a virtual reality walk on Mars.

(Photo: TIM SHORTT/ FLORIDA TODAY) “I did a lot of (extra-vehicular) training for my crew members back in Houston, and that’s pretty realistic training,” said Jon McBride, who piloted the shuttle Challenger in 1984. On Monday, McBride joined Sam Durrance, a two-time shuttle flier and Florida Institute of Technology professor, training with the first ATX guests. Each simulator relies on teams whose members take turns working ""in space"" or as mission controllers supporting the space work. From the training hangar, guests may climb a ramp and ride an elevator for a launch to Mars Base Camp 1 for a day of work in operations, engineering and life sciences laboratories. Last Slide Next Slide The latter grows plants in partnership with NASA scientists performing experiments on the ISS and planning for deep space missions. During Monday’s soft opening, the Mars lander and rover simulators experienced a few audio glitches. But C’hi Stinnett, the Titusville seventh-grader, said the experience of virtually walking on Mars felt so real she accidentally bumped into the curtains dividing participants. She hopes professional astronauts have access to such training before they journey to Mars, a trip taking six to nine months each way that NASA hopes may be possible in the 2030s. “That’s a really good experience to learn before they go to Mars,” Stinnett said. “It was fun.

MIMI VU,"Photo The artist Francesca DiMattio in her studio in Hillsdale, N.Y., with two paintings, “The Octopus and the Fish” and “The Fox and the Hound,” that will debut at her latest solo show, “Boucherouite,” opening on March 6 at Salon 94 Bowery in New York City. Credit Matthew Novak The artist Francesca DiMattio is zigzagging across her vast, warehouselike studio in the rural town of Hillsdale, N.Y., simultaneously firing porcelain, hand-painting ceramic flowers and touching up pottery glazes for three different sculptures. Wearing a paint-splattered brown mechanic’s suit, crowned with her signature Frida Kahlo-esque braids and vibrant coral lips, she is a portrait of elegant incongruity. “I’m really interested in contrast,” she says, “and it’s something I always want in my life.” On this morning, there is just over a week until DiMattio’s latest show opens at Salon 94 Bowery in New York City, and her new paintings and sculptures are not yet finished. This is largely the result, she says, of her hectic reality in the two-plus years since her last solo show; she has been hopscotching between city and country living, juggling work and her two-year-old son, Bruno, with her husband, the artist Garth Weiser. “I left months to make this show, which should have taken a year and a half,” she says. Photo DiMattio puts the finishing touches on “Venus I.” Since she began making ceramic sculptures eight years ago, she has worked to test the limits of the medium. “Ceramic wants to be symmetrical and even and round — that’s what gives it its strength,” she says, “What I make with all these weird forms, it’s straining the material more and more.” Credit Matthew Novak So, on this wintry day, with a sleet storm looming over the Berkshire Mountains outside her expansive windows, she’s working briskly amid an indoor blizzard of paint pots, ladders and chicken wire. Dotting the space are classical torsos, animal figurines and cartoonishly large children’s shoes made of porcelain and stoneware — elements she will later combine in her complex, hybrid pieces. One of her new ceramic sculptures for the show, tentatively titled “She-Wolf,” still lies in parts around an armature of steel pipes. When it is finished, its form will resemble a kind of buffalo-llama chimera, with a bisonlike sculpted head, a Turkish Iznik-patterned leg, and breasts on its underside referencing the maternal wolf from the myth of Romulus and Remus. The theme of contrast has been a lifelong — and career-defining — preoccupation for DiMattio, who grew up in Manhattan in the 1980s and 1990s and spent summers at her parents’ country home in Saugerties, N.Y. (her mother is also a ceramist). Since earning her M.F.A. from Columbia in 2005, she’s steadily garnered acclaim for her large-scale paintings and sculptures, which interweave a dizzying array of art historical references, craft techniques and decorative styles. In her sculptures, DiMattio has spliced together elements as diverse as Delft pottery, Sèvres porcelain, Wedgwood china and spikes reminiscent of nail-studded Nkondi religious idols. Her paintings have toyed with unlikely intersections of architectural space, abstract patterns and textile prints. DiMattio’s new show, “Boucherouite,” which opens on March 6, takes its name from the colorful, tufted rag rugs woven from torn and recycled clothing by Berber women in Morocco. The works — two paintings and three sculptures — continue her fascination with cultural and aesthetic sampling, using the pieced-together patterns and textures of boucherouite as a leitmotif. Photo DiMattio, working beside her piece “Venus II,” applies glaze to sculpted ceramic flowers. The artist moves fluidly between a range of ceramic styles — from Iznik pottery to jasperware to Sèvres porcelain — producing them much as they were made historically. Credit Matthew Novak As DiMattio walks me around her studio, the sculptures tower over us in twisting configurations. At the far end of the studio stands “Venus I,” a bright-pink female figure in classical Greek style with a Louise Bourgeois-esque cluster of breasts on her backside. Her hand clasps a phallus adorned with Ming dynasty porcelain motifs. An aberrant arm juts out from one side, sporting a Mickey Mouse glove glazed with Viennese florals. All around the figure encroaches the colorful pile of sculpted boucherouite (made by extruding clay through a garlic press, DiMattio notes). On the other side of the studio, “Venus II,” anchored by a ceramic giant panda with a Venus of Willendorf on its posterior, sprouts a structure that calls to mind an otherworldly tree or magnified piece of coral. “It’s all about the way the different elements interact with one another,” DiMattio explains. “Every piece is interrupted or affected by something next to it. It has a kind of grafted surface.” Continue reading the main story","The artist Francesca DiMattio in her studio in Hillsdale, N.Y., with two paintings, “The Octopus and the Fish” and “The Fox and the Hound,” that will debut at her latest solo show, “Boucherouite,” opening on March 6 at Salon 94 Bowery in New York City.",2018-03-06T22:11:57Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Artist Testing the Limits of Ceramics,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/t-magazine/art/francesca-dimattio-ceramics.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/06/t-magazine/art/06tmag-dimattio-slide-TPOT/06tmag-dimattio-slide-TPOT-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,storm complex,1
Nick Summers,"Levels are themed around objects which, put together, reveal special memories. The time-shifting puzzles were inspired by the 2002 science fiction film Minority Report. Back in 2011, The Voxel Agents were thinking about a game centered around memories that you could subtly change. ""We made 30 different prototypes with really varying ideas,"" Matthew Clark, the director and programmer of The Gardens Between said. The studio was only two years old, though, and wasn't ready to take on a project that was so ambitious. ""The scale was huge, it was content heavy and just very expensive to make,"" Simon Joslin, the game's eventual level designer and executive producer said. ""We didn't have the funds, so we set it aside."" ""It's important to cherish and appreciate those special times."" The team worked on a smartphone game called Puzzle Retreat before returning to its time-bending prototypes in 2014. Much of the four-year development cycle was dedicated to the puzzles, which were extremely complex to design. Many started on paper as two simple timelines for Arina and Frendt. Though you push the characters forward simultaneously, they often diverge and encounter different objects. These points of interaction create forks, or divergences, that impact everything else in the level. The team had to map all of these out, as well as every possible permutation if players accidentally triggered them out of order. Testing and subsequently tweaking the island puzzles had massive ramifications. ""Moving a single object before or after another object can change every single possible permutation for what the player can do in that world,"" Joslin explained. ""[The game] was such a nightmare to design."" Rewinding time to enter a passcode. The puzzles needed to be thematic, too. Every garden is part of a cluster that, once completed, unlocks a complete memory shared by the two girls. The aforementioned computer puzzle, for example, is succeeded by a level about a giant set of dinosaur bones. Finish both and you'll see a vignette of a museum exhibit that contains both relics. All of the gardens, then, had to fit both the game's linear story and slowly escalating difficulty curve. The head-scratching puzzles and breadcrumb storytelling work in tandem. If you're stuck on a particular puzzle, your thumb will naturally leave the analog stick, causing time to freeze. I did this all the time both to contemplate a puzzle and admire the gorgeous art by illustrator Jonathan Swanson. On a subconscious level, I was also scrutinizing every detail that would eventually form the plot-critical vignettes. It meant the complete memories felt more vivid, and fully realized, than a traditional cutscene. You're only getting glimpses of Arina and Frendt's friendship -- but like our own fuzzy memories, it's enough to feel a nostalgic longing for the past. ""I barely have time for friends now,"" Clark said. ""And it's kind of a shame. But it's also important to cherish and appreciate those special times."" I won't spoil the ending (you really need to play it for yourself). If you're interested, the game is out now for $19.99 on PS4, PC and Nintendo Switch.","How much of your childhood do you remember?

Andrew Freedman,"The stage is set for a dramatic change in the weather pattern across the Northern Hemisphere during the next seven to 10 days. That change will likely bring a brutal Arctic blast across the Midwest and eastern U.S., put Western Europe into the deep freeze, and maintain an area of extreme cold in eastern Asia. The new weather pattern could give rise to snowstorms along the East Coast of the U.S., though it's too early to tell whether that will happen, forecasters say. What is clear is that winter is coming — ASAP. SEE ALSO: La Niña is officially here to shape U.S. winter weather, along with global climate Computer model projections show an Arctic air mass diving southeastward, into the U.S., by Dec. 10, and potentially setting up shop for one to two weeks. Daytime highs will be at least 15 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average for this time of year, with the heart of the cold projected to be centered somewhere near the Ohio Valley. The cold air blowing across the comparatively mild waters of the Great Lakes could yield prolific lake effect snows from Wisconsin to New York State. While the Arctic air won't be historically cold, it will cause a nasty outbreak of weather whiplash after the historically mild fall that much of the U.S. enjoyed. ""I think the locations that will see the most anomalous cold will be the Great Lakes down through the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys,"" said Michael Ventrice, a meteorologist with WSI Corp, which is part of The Weather Company. Ventrice added that he thinks northern Minnesota could see sub-zero temperatures for nighttime low temperatures, while even Nashville and Atlanta could have low temperatures that dip into the 20s Fahrenheit. Computer model projection for Dec. 9 through Dec. 14, showing areas of unusual warmth (red), and unusual cold (blue). Image: wsi via michael ventrice. The weather pattern that is going to take shape features a wavy jet stream, with big swings to the north and the south, like a snake slithering along a path. The jet stream consists of a corridor of high winds blowing near the top of the troposphere, or about 35,000 feet up, that separates air masses and both steers and helps fuel storm systems. A wavy jet stream can cause weather features to get stuck in place, with large ridges of high pressure acting as atmospheric traffic lights, preventing oncoming weather systems from passing by. In mid-December, strong areas of high pressure are forecast to develop and hold in position in high latitudes, forming what's known as a blocking pattern. Such blocks, particularly a high pressure area over Greenland, tend to be associated with cold air outbreaks and snowstorms in the eastern U.S. and Western Europe. The high latitude blocking will bring unusually mild air for this time of year to the Arctic, likely resulting in a sharp slowdown in the growth of winter sea ice across the region. ""The most unusual warmth is going to be across Alaska [on] through the Arctic Circle,"" Ventrice said. We are seeing temperature anomalies in excess of 30 degrees [Fahrenheit compared to average] in some locations around the North Pole, which will likely delay or reduce Arctic sea ice growth/extent,"" he added. As of late November, Arctic sea ice extent was at its second-lowest level on record in the satellite era, with virtually no ice cover in the Chuckchi Sea near Alaska.

Decent coverage and intensity of cold for early December. pic.twitter.com/dqHwuUWkDb — Ryan Maue | weather.us (@RyanMaue) November 29, 2017 Emerging research suggests that slow growth of Arctic sea ice during the fall and early winter can alter weather patterns in the northern midlatitudes, including by increasing fall snowfall in parts of Siberia. Such developments may help, through a series of complex interactions between the lower and upper atmosphere, disrupt the polar vortex encircling the Arctic region, and bring more frigid air into North America and Europe. The main polar vortex consists of a circulation of air enveloping a near-permanent area of low pressure that exists in the upper atmosphere, a layer known as the stratosphere, over the Arctic. When these winds weaken, which is forecast to occur by Dec. 11 to 15, pieces of the vortex can break off, and drift south into the U.S., Europe, and parts of Asia. Arctic sea ice extent, with 2017 in orange. Image: jaxa/nsidc/zack labe Such a polar vortex disruption is forecast to be part of the reason why the weather pattern will change so drastically across such a broad area during the next few weeks. A weakening of the polar vortex could even help keep the high latitude blocking in place longer than it otherwise would. ""I think the cold pattern does in fact have some legs to it,"" Ventrice said.

""The big question mark of winter 2017-2018 is whether we see more frequent Greenland Blocking episodes,"" he said. ""Last winter, we did not.

Kirsten Korosec,"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s vision of an “entirely new system of transport,” which he unveiled Wednesday night at a splashy event in Hawthorne, California, wasn’t a reusable rocket like the ones he’s building at his nearby SpaceX headquarters. Nor is it an electric vehicle, like the Teslas he is producing at a factory in Fremont, California.
Tonight, Musk showed off a 1.14-mile test tunnel that snakes its way underneath 120th Street in the city of Hawthorne that his other business, the Boring Company, dug for about $10 million using a modified boring machine called Godot. (That $10 million figures includes the cost of building the tunnel, all internal infrastructure, lighting, communication and video, safety systems, ventilation, and track, according to the company.) For Musk, this is merely a demonstration of what could be: a network of low-cost tunnels used for transportation, utilities or water and built for millions of dollars, or even billions less than those constructed for subways or trains.
These tunnels, which at about 12-feet in diameter are smaller than a subway, are cheaper to build thanks to the company’s boring machines, Musk and Boring Company president Steve Davis contend.
The tunnels could be stacked Musk calls it a 3D network and operate like a giant underground highway with vehicles entering and exiting at strategic points along the way via ramp, spiral or elevator depending on available space. The main tunnel would allow vehicles, which are stabilized via a retractable tracking wheels, to travel up to 150 miles per hour. Once a vehicle leaves the main artery, speeds would be reduced. (The retractable tracking wheels are important, new development; Musk said they originally were going to place the vehicles on a skate, which would travel at high speeds, but ditched the idea because it was too “complex.”
These entry points could take as little room as two parking spaces for an elevator, Musk said, which TechCrunch was able to attest to, at least with the demonstration tunnel.
“You can weave these stations throughout the fabric of the city without changing the character of the city, Musk said during a press briefing.
There are some important caveats to this system. This is a concept; it currently doesn’t exist at the scale Musk envisions, although there are numerous cities and utilities interested. (Davis noted they get between 5 and 20 requests or inquires a day from municipalities and utilities).
And only autonomous, electric vehicles would be allowed in the Loop, as The Boring Company is calling the concept. A Tesla Model X was used in the demo Wednesday night, although Musk insisted during a press briefing that “this is not some walled garden or something only for Teslas.”
The Loop would also have dedicated vehicles for pedestrians and bicyclists that Musk speculated could cost about $1 a ride, if shared. The vehicles designated for public transport would run in a loop and get priority.
TechCrunch’s ride through the Hawthorne test tunnel began near 120th street and Prairie Avenue, next to a nondescript building “The Brick Store” stenciled discreetly on one side  that only stood out because of all the security surrounding it. The Model X had been outfitted with the  retractable wheels, which Musk said would be an aftermarket product that might cost between $200 and $300.
Once the vehicle descended, the test driver slowly accelerated to about 44 mph through the tunnel, back towards Crenshaw and 120th Street. The tunnel, hazy with dust from the construction, and lit by neon-like lighting, delivered a bumpy-ish ride on occasion. Musk later explained that this was because they had some trouble with the paving. A system for the public would be much smoother, he said.
The entry point, near the Brick Store, provides an important link to the Boring Company story and vision. Earlier this year, TechCrunch reported that Musk has started a company called The Brick Store LLC to produce and sell bricks, according to public documents. The new company, which was founded in July, will be managed by Davis, the ex-SpaceX engineer who is also running The Boring Company (TBC).
The plan, is for the Boring Company to use the dirt extracted during the boring process to produce bricks, which will cost $0.10 a brick, Musk said.
The next step for the Boring Company is to develop its next generation boring machine, the Line Storm (refernce to a Robert Frost poem) and eventually Prufrock, which will deliver a 15-fold cost savings to current technologies, Musk said.
And that’s just the beginning.

Jeff Beer,"Well here we are, teetering on the precipice of another first day of April. It’s the calm before April Fool’s storm, when we’ll be inundated with completely pointless brand stunts. No one cares about Turkey Hill’s bovine dating site. Or T-Mobile’s ONEsie. Regardless, hundreds of brands unleash their, uh, wittiest little wonders onto the world–wonders that, after 24 hours, become the pop cultural equivalent of that plastic island floating in the middle of the ocean. And yet here we are. So if you are going to pull a branded April Fool’s Day prank (and let’s face it, you are, and you started working on it before Christmas), please, oh please make it good. What’s good? Let’s take a look at some past examples for a few general tips. Taco Bell “Taco Liberty Bell” In 1996, before the internet age had fully taken hold–and before Lil Yachty was even born–Taco Bell took out a full-page ad in the New York Times announcing it had purchased the rights to the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia and would be renaming it the Taco Liberty Bell. Tip: Be unexpected and be bold. Google Maps “Pokemon Challenge” In a move that reportedly inspired the actual Pokémon Go a few years later, back in 2014, Google invited users to catch pokémon inside of the Google Maps app. Tip: Get weird, but the more people can actually participate, the better. Google’s been following its own advice since, with subsequent years seeing Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man become playable within the Maps app. Amazon “Petlexa” In what is definitely a precursor to the brand’s hit Super Bowl ad this year, last April Amazon imagined if it had an Alexa for pets. Tip: Make it ridiculous, but juuuust this side of believably ridiculous. You know someone is deep in a lead-lined bunker under Amazon HQ tinkering on this idea. Also, people LOVE their pets. Netflix “Stamos: A Human, Being” I mean... right? Tip: John Stamos documentary. Hamburger Helper “Watch The Stove” This might just be the best branded April Fool’s in recent memory. A five-song mixtape featuring largely unknown producers that Complex called “ one of the hottest mixtapes of the year. ” Tip: As my colleague Dan Solomon wrote last year, “If you’re going to create an April Fools’ prank, you should probably take a lesson from Hamburger Helper: Dump the lies and just make something really good that people actually want instead.” Amen.","Five tips from some of the best branded April 1 stunts ever.

Megan Cassidy,"For more than a half-century, a select group of California prisoners has worked shoulder-to-shoulder with wildland firefighters battling the state’s deadliest blazes. More than 3,000 inmate volunteer firefighters are performing the back-straining labor, according to Cal Fire. They’re clearing brush and digging lines for the Ferguson, Carr and Mendocino Complex fires, which have torched a combined 577,000 acres of California land in another historic season. It’s a tough gig and the pay is paltry — an average of $2 per day and $1 per hour when they’re fighting an active fire. But officials say it’s a coveted position among low-level offenders, male and female. “It’s not something that they’re forced to do,” said Cal Fire spokeswoman Lynne Tolmachoff. The work cuts time off sentences, pays more than other inmate jobs, and provides many with a sense of purpose, officials say. “With a lot of the guys we’ve spoken to, they feel like they’re giving back to the state, helping in that way,” she said. The practice has been blasted by some progressives like former Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, who calls the work “tantamount to slave labor.” “At this point, they’re being paid $1 an hour for fighting these ferocious fires — that’s outrageous,” she said, adding that the inmates deserve a reasonable wage for risking their lives. But perhaps the most hotly disputed issue is the inmates’ narrow pathway to industry work after release. This year, a new parolee training program will help former inmates become more competitive in the field, but many advocates say the measure doesn’t go far enough. The problem lies with emergency medical technician licenses, said Katherine Katcher, founder and executive director of the re-entry advocacy group Root &amp; Rebound in Oakland. Most people leaving prison return to urban areas, Katcher said, and want to work for their local departments. But those agencies also require that people get an EMT certification — a condition that Katcher said blocks many ex-offenders. This year, the state budget includes $26.6 million to create a firefighter training and certification program for 80 ex-offenders annually. The 18-month program will take place at the Ventura Conservation Camp, and include life skills training and comprehensive firefighter courses and certification. To be eligible, participants must have served with Cal Fire while incarcerated. The center is expected to have its first cohort this fall. “Participants who successfully complete the program will be qualified to apply for entry-level firefighting jobs with local, state and federal firefighting agencies,” the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement. “It’s a very exciting program,” said Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman Vicky Waters. “We think it’s such an innovate thing, and we’re really looking forward to seeing what the impact is.” Cal Fire officials have said the volunteer crews save the state about $100 million annually and can account for up to 40 percent of the men and women battling the flames. The crews are chosen from a pool of applicants with “minimum custody” status, or those who have exhibited good behavior in prison. There are automatic disqualifiers. Inmates who have committed arson, murder or sex offenses, those with active warrants, a history of escape attempts or medical issues, or those with high-profile cases, among others, are ineligible. Waters said the inmates are treated no differently than Cal Fire firefighters. They receive the same training and perform the same duties, working on fire lines, clearing flood channels and storm drains and cutting brush to reduce fire danger. “They are wildland firefighters and they’re trained as such,” Waters said. Inmates have walked away from fire camps, but they’re always captured within 48 hours, Waters said. This mostly happens when it’s not active fire season, she said, and there’s a strong disincentive: Those caught escaping are sent back to the brick-and-mortar facility and are disqualified from the program. The work can be dangerous, too. An inmate firefighter died during a training hike in April, and by late 2017 there had been five inmate fatalities since the program began in the 1940s. Katcher said while she supports the parolee program, its impact is limited and does nothing to change the regulatory framework throughout the state. Root &amp; Rebound and other civil rights organizations pushed for a bill this year that would have mandated a framework for considering ex-offenders for the certifications, potentially opening the career path to more of them. “It was defining what was appropriate and fair consideration rather than blanket denials,” Katcher said. “Nowhere did the bill say that the (criminal) records would not be assessed.” AB2293 was turned into a study bill this year, but Katcher said she will be pushing for similar legislation in 2019. “This (parolee) program is going to impact 80 people in 18 months, compared to the 4,000 people who are actually fighting fires — those people will have no relief through this bill,” Katcher said. “I still don’t understand why it had to be an either-or situation.” Megan Cassidy is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

John Burnett,"Francisco Vasquez at work on the Prestige Oysters boat The Diplomat. Scott Dalton/for NPR Hurricane Harvey caused catastrophic damage in Houston, but the historic deluge also brought calamity to the Houston Ship Channel and Galveston Bay. The aftermath of the storm threatens two vital industries — one mammoth and ironclad, the other small and slimy: shipping and oysters. Fire Boat One cruises down the Houston Ship Channel — one of the hardest working waterways in America. On either side of the channel are grain silos, warehouses and storage tanks for products ranging from petroleum to molasses. Giant container ships refuel for their voyages back across the Atlantic Ocean. Tugboats are nudging rusty barges in every direction. ""You look out here today, it's a nice calm day, except that we're draft restricted,"" says Mark Vincent, director of channel development at the Port of Houston. The term means that the channel is too shallow for ship traffic in certain places. Houstonians were relieved when floodwaters drained from the city's bayous into the ship channel, then the bay, and finally into the Gulf. But that was just the beginning of Vincent's troubles. ""This storm event was absolutely extraordinary,"" he says, riding on the bow of the fire boat. ""We estimate millions of tons of sediment were carried into the ship channel, all of which need to be removed over time in order to enable safe navigation of our ships."" A boat dredges the ship channel on the Port of Houston. Due to the flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey, massive amounts of dredging are needed to get the ship channel back to a normal operating state. Scott Dalton/for NPR The Port of Houston ranks as the busiest port in the nation, and first in foreign waterborne tonnage. It serves the largest petrochemical complex in America. But these shoals created by Harvey mean that cargo-laden ships run the risk of running aground because they sit so low in the water. ""And we have many, many ships that might have to plan to bring less cargo and over time bring more ships to Houston simply because we're draft restricted. And that's inefficient, and ultimately it's going to cost consumers money,"" Vincent says. Enter the dredges. These ungainly workhorses suck mud from the murky floor of the channel 24/7. More than a century ago, dredge boats scooped out an underwater trench 52 miles long — down Buffalo Bayou and across shallow Galveston Bay — to create the Houston ship channel. Ever since, nature has been trying to fill it back in. The dredges have to maintain the channel at a depth of 45 feet for the deep-draft ships delivering Volkswagens, wind turbine blades and other heavy cargo to the seaport. ""We do this over and over again. Our district's been dredging for over a hundred years. This is what we do,"" says Tricia Campbell, operations manager with the Galveston District of the Army Corps of Engineers. A landfill used by The Port of Houston to dump material dredged from the ship channel after Hurricane Harvey. Scott Dalton/for NPR Every year for the past three years, huge floods in Houston have forced emergency dredging. In fact, the workboats were still scooping up silt from earlier storms when Harvey struck. With more monster storms hitting Houston, the port lobbies Congress to give the Corps additional funding to maintain the ship channel. Campbell concedes they could use more dredges. ""Well, we can definitely do more than what we're already doing,"" she says. ""If we had more funding we could put out more contracts, more dredging. But at this time we work with what we get."" After Harvey's 4 feet of rain fouled up the ship channel, it poured into Galveston Bay. ""It essentially turned Galveston Bay into a freshwater lake,"" says Bob Stokes, president of the Galveston Bay Foundation, ""and many of our species were impacted negatively by all that freshwater. The one that's going to have the longest term impact is our oysters."" Galveston Bay is one of the country's major oyster fisheries. Oystermen are reporting a massive kill-off of the delectable mollusk — which, here on the Gulf Coast, is dipped in red cocktail sauce mixed with horseradish and a dash of Tabasco, and eaten with a crisp saltine. Raz Halili — co-owner of Prestige Oysters — says when he came to his company's docks after the storm, the bay had so much muddy freshwater it looked like a melted chocolate bar. Not good for the oysters. ""They need brackish water, they need that mixture of freshwater and saltwater to really thrive. But when you get too much of one thing, it can be bad."" Captain Shpend Berisha, left, at the helm of the Prestige Oysters boat The Diplomat while Francisco Vasquez, center, and Ekrem Sahiti pull in oysters in Galveston Bay. Scott Dalton/for NPR It was supposed to be a banner year for Galveston Bay oysters. They'd come back strong from successive bad seasons brought on by earlier storms. Harvey has set back the harvest again. An oyster boat named the Hustler sidles up to the dock, as white pelicans dive for lunch out on the bay. Mexican deckhands heave 100-lb. sacks of the bivalves onto a conveyor belt. Arsem Hyseni — an immigrant from Kosovo, just like the owners of Prestige Oysters — steps off the boat after six hours on the water. ""They (oysters) are hurt pretty bad. In some places, 100 percent die. Some places we working now it's 40 to 50 percent die. Some places better. But hit pretty hard this time."" The oysters will eventually recover, but in the near term, prices on the half-shell will jump. The dredges will work to deepen the ship channel, but in the meantime it will make shipping more expensive. The costs from Hurricane Harvey keep piling up.",The sediment and muddy freshwater that spilled into these Texas bodies of water are causing problems for the shipping and oyster industries.,2017-12-10T11:36:24Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Houston Ship Channel And Galveston Bay Digging Out After Harvey,https://www.npr.org/2017/12/10/569463500/houston-ship-channel-and-galveston-bay-digging-out-after-harvey,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/12/08/hou_a_oysters_019_wide-092993d790c1aa9424e49d59337e792bfdcf6ef8.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,storm complex,1
The Conversation,"When those first fat drops of summer rain fall to the hot, dry ground, have you ever noticed a distinctive odor? I have childhood memories of family members who were farmers describing how they could always smell rain right before a storm.
Of course rain itself has no scent. But moments before a rain event, an earthy smell known as petrichor does permeate the air. People call it musky, fresh generally pleasant.
This smell actually comes from the moistening of the ground. Australian scientists first documented the process of petrichor formation in 1964 and scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology further studied the mechanics of the process in the 2010s.
Petrichor is a combination of fragrant chemical compounds. Some are from oils made by plants. The main contributor to petrichor are actinobacteria. These tiny microorganisms can be found in rural and urban areas as well as in marine environments. They decompose dead or decaying organic matter into simple chemical compounds which can then become nutrients for developing plants and other organisms.

Petrichors main ingredients are made by plants and bacteria that live in the ground.
A byproduct of their activity is an organic compound called geosmin which contributes to the petrichor scent. Geosmin is a type of alcohol, like rubbing alcohol. Alcohol molecules tend to have a strong scent, but the complex chemical structure of geosmin makes it especially noticeable to people even at extremely low levels. Our noses can detect just a few parts of geosmin per trillion of air molecules.
During a prolonged period of dryness when it has not rained for several days, the decomposition activity rate of the actinobacteria slows down. Just before a rain event, the air becomes more humid and the ground begins to moisten. This process helps to speed up the activity of the actinobacteria and more geosmin is formed.
When raindrops fall on the ground, especially porous surfaces such as loose soil or rough concrete, they will splatter and eject tiny particles called aerosols. The geosmin and other petrichor compounds that may be present on the ground or dissolved within the raindrop are released in aerosol form and carried by the wind to surrounding areas. If the rainfall is heavy enough, the petrichor scent can travel rapidly downwind and alert people that rain is soon on the way.
The scent eventually goes away after the storm has passed and the ground begins to dry. This leaves the actinobacteria lying in wait ready to help us know when it might rain again.

Andrea Thompson,"Hurricane Florence is bearing down on the U.S as a major hurricane that could inundate the coast with up to 13 feet of surging ocean water and more than two feet of rain. Each of those flood hazards can do devastating damage on their own. But the combination of the two—a situation called compound flooding—could make floodwaters even higher, last longer and reach farther inland than anticipated. Compound flooding is complex, so it has generally not been considered in flood forecasting and prevention planning. Now it is gaining attention among researchers and coastal emergency managers working to better understand who and what will be flooded during extreme weather events as well as how threats might change as coastal populations boom and the climate transforms. “We have ignored it in the past, we cannot ignore it in the future,” says Amir AghaKouchak, a civil engineer at the University of California, Irvine, who has studied the issue. As a tropical storm reaches land, its winds pile up ocean water in front of it, pushing a surge ashore. Meanwhile torrential rains can overwhelm the ground and rivers, causing floods even hundreds of miles inland. But compound flooding arises when both dynamics meet, exacerbating the overall impact. Compound flooding contributed to the unprecedented inundation of the Houston area during Hurricane Harvey. Although that storm’s record rains would have caused terrible flooding on their own, the moderate ocean surge that lingered in Galveston Bay as Harvey stalled meant floodwaters stayed high for days. Typically, a storm surge pushes in, then washes out; heavy rain falls on the coast and inland, draining via gravity to the sea, often via rivers and streams. But if a huge storm stalls along the coast, high seas can continue to push onto land after the initial surge. That high water can stop heavy rain from draining. Water rises everywhere and can stay that way for days. As a result, people can be trapped with no direction to escape, possibly without power or food—as they were during Harvey, necessitating widespread search and rescue operations. “That’s just a completely different impact than we’ve traditionally prepared for,” says Antonia Sebastian, an associate research scientist at Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston, who studied the event. The entire Southeast coast is a hotspot for this type of flooding, in part because it is prone to being hit by tropical systems, according to a 2015 study spearheaded by Thomas Wahl, a civil engineer at the University of Central Florida. A similar situation could play out with Florence, which is expected to stall once it makes landfall, sandwiched in by two atmospheric high-pressure systems, as happened with Harvey. As Florence lingers, it will continue to push surge ashore and rains will pile up. Forecasts indicate up to 30 inches of rain, with some isolated spots possibly reaching 40 inches. Areas at particular risk from compound flooding are those near some of the major river watersheds, including the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse basins, both of which empty into Pamlico Sound, says Jessica Whitehead, a hazards adaptation strategist with the North Carolina Sea Grant. Surge strength and local geography can change the likelihood and location of compound flooding. Higher surge pushes farther inland, increasing the area that could be subject to compound flooding. Topography that tends to drain water away quickly also increases the odds of rainwater flood and surge coinciding, Sebastian says. “When you start to zoom into the coastline, there are these really complex features.” When determining where compound flooding is likely to happen, “you begin to face these challenges of every coastline behaving differently.” Researchers like Sebastian, AghaKouchak and Wahl are working to make these risks clearer so they can be incorporated into coastal communities’ flood protection planning. Wahl is working with both the Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District to see if the flood levels they plan for would change when compound flooding is factored in. The level of a 100-year flood could be much higher, in which case “we may have to adjust our flood zones,” Wahl says. Where flood protection infrastructure is placed and how it is designed could change as well. Wahl is also resubmitting a proposal to study compound flooding in Jacksonville; it had been rejected two weeks before such flooding during Hurricane Irma damaged the Florida city. Prior to Irma, “people were saying, ‘that’s not really a research priority,’” he says. Sebastian is examining how warming might change the atmospheric patterns that contribute to storms stalling and “where and to what extent is that going to exacerbate compound flooding,” she says. AghaKouchak is studying how sea level rise might affect such flooding; a 2017 study he co-authored found that when compound flooding and sea level rise were factored in, the chances of floods that exceed what local infrastructure was built to accommodate went up considerably. Understanding compound flooding requires advanced computer models and complex statistics. It will take time for scientists to fully understand the evolving risks. The aim, though, is to one day have forecast maps like those that already exist separately for rainfall and storm surge, and which would show where compound flooding is likely to crop up during a storm. “That has to be the goal,” Wahl says.",Compound flooding can exacerbate the impacts from storm surge and rain -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2018-09-12T14:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}","Extreme Flooding from Florence Likely, Due to Convergence of Threats",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/extreme-flooding-from-florence-likely-due-to-convergence-of-threats/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/B1AE0627-280B-43D8-9D6F337FEFA3EA2E.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,storm complex,1

Backyard soil can lock in more planet-warming emissions than soils found in native grasslands or urban forests. So that patch of green that we think of as a source of personal enjoyment can help the community at large. Of course, bigger green spaces in cities are important, too.

By Friday night and into Saturday, it appears two systems will become one organized system, bringing rain to the southern Plains and some snow to the Midwest and parts of the Mississippi River Valley.
This same storm will slide off fairly quickly to the Ohio and Missouri River valleys on Saturday. A cold front approaching from the northwest will try to interact with this system, and, at the very least, the combination of systems should help draw more snow northward into the I-70 corridor.
The storm then will shift toward the East Coast over the weekend. It doesn't appear at this time that the two systems will completely phase together and create a blockbuster storm. The storm may intensify somewhat off the coast on Sunday.
Although the likelihood of snowfall in parts of the Midwest and East Coast is increasing, it remains unclear the potential magnitude of this weather event. As of this morning, two reliable weather models are indicating there's not enough support in forecasting a major storm this weekend.
Another storm is hitting the West Coast today.
The latest Pacific storm is delivering rain, gusty winds and snow to the West Coast.
Booneville, California, just north of San Francisco, already has seen 3 inches this morning. A wind gust of almost 80 mph was reported in Lagunitas Forest. This series of storms has over the last few days dumped at least 39 inches of snow at Donner Peak, at the Sugar Bowl Ski Resort.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"During bigger snowstorms, he added, temperatures tend to rise closer to freezing. So in New York, at least, “you don’t tend to see that big a snowstorm in the single digits.” (Case in point: During the blizzard in January 2016, one of the largest snowfalls ever recorded in New York City, temperatures were generally in the 20s.) So what ingredients are needed to cook up a perfect storm? “In order to get snow of significance,” Mr. Homenuk said, “the main things you need are cold enough temperatures, lift in the atmosphere and moisture.” Later this week, when temperatures are expected to climb closer to 30, we may see some flurries. We’re in the clear for snow today and tomorrow, but it may feel as bone-chilling as 0 degrees as you head out for the day. “I’m sure people will be asking when it’s going to end,” Mr. Homenuk said of this cold spell. “We can probably look at the second week of January when things will start to improve — when our confidence will go up that when you walk outside, it’s going to be much less unpleasant than it is right now.” Here’s what else is happening: In the News • Mayor Bill de Blasio was sworn in for his second and last term on Monday.

Beginning today, the entire loop-drive through the park — east and west sides — will become car-free. The decision was decades in the making. Most recently, when the park held a trial run last summer, the city’s Department of Transportation found that closing the roadways to cars caused little to no incremental delays, further making a case for the change to be permanent. “As Brooklyn’s backyard,” said Sue Donoghue, president of the Prospect Park Alliance, “it is important to do all we can to ensure the park is a safe and tranquil destination for the millions of visitors who depend upon it for recreation and relaxation.” Following implementation today, the department plans to monitor traffic patterns in the area and adjust traffic signals if necessary. Now all we need is some warmer weather so we can actually enjoy it.

BRAD PLUMER,"The Battery area of Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Companies are seeking better climate forecasts to assess the risks of operating in the area. Credit Sean Rayford for The New York Times In Charleston, S.C., where the ports have been expanding to accommodate larger ships sailing through the newly widened Panama Canal, a real-estate developer named Xebec Realty recently went looking for land to build new warehouses and logistics centers. But first, Xebec had a question: What were the odds that the sites it was considering might be underwater in 10 or 20 years? After all, Charleston has repeatedly suffered major floods that can paralyze cargo operations. And scientists warn that flooding will worsen as sea levels rise and storms strengthen with climate change. Yet detailed information about the city’s climate risks proved surprisingly hard to find. Federal flood maps are based on historical data, and won’t tell you how sea-level rise could exacerbate flooding in the years ahead. Scientific reports on global warming, such as the National Climate Assessment, can tell you that heavy rainstorms are expected to increase in the Southeast, but they won’t tell you whether specific roads leading to a given warehouse might be unusable during those storms. So Xebec turned to a Silicon Valley start-up called Jupiter, which offered to analyze local weather and hydrological data and combine it with climate model projections to assess the potential climate risks Xebec might face in Charleston over the next few decades from things like heavier rainfall, sea level rise or increased storm surge. Although Jupiter’s forecasting skill remains unproven, Xebec was eager to participate in a pilot project. “If we could have reliable predictive analytics in this area, that’s a huge impact for our business,” said Scott Hodgkins, an executive vice president at Xebec. As companies around the world grow concerned about the risks of climate change, they have started looking for clarity on how warming might disrupt their operations in the future. But governments in the United States and Europe have been slow to translate academic research on global warming into practical, timely advice for businesses or local city planners. Now some private companies, like Jupiter, are trying to fill the gap. This remains a young and untested field, and it’s unclear whether Jupiter or others can succeed as profitable enterprises. Scientists caution that predicting short-term climate effects in specific locations remains rife with uncertainty. Jupiter will have to persuade potential customers that its forecasts are reliable enough to give companies a competitive edge. “In economics, information has value if you would make a different decision based on that information,” said Matthew E. Kahn, an economist who studies climate adaptation at the University of Southern California. “Is that the case here?” Some insurance companies, such as FM Global, already study climate risks and consult with clients on how to make their buildings more resilient to hurricanes that may get stronger in the future. In 2014, a start-up called Coastal Risk Consulting opened in South Florida to offer flood assessments to homeowners nervous about rising seas. Jupiter, founded in 2017 by Rich Sorkin, a longtime tech entrepreneur, wants to go a step further. The start-up has received $10 million in venture capital so far and has been hiring climate scientists, weather modelers and data experts from places like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Its co-founders include Todd D. Stern, the lead climate envoy in the Obama administration, and Jeff Wecker, the chief data officer for Goldman Sachs. The company is developing a variety of predictive tools, some of which look much like Google Maps, that it hopes will allow paying customers to zoom down to the city block level to get a better sense of the potential risks they face from storms, heat waves, wildfires or other climate-change effects in the coming decades. A map of Charleston generated by Jupiter that forecasts flooding from storm surges that have a 1 percent probability of occurring annually by 2030 under a high-end emissions scenario. Credit Jupiter Intel “We know the planet’s getting warmer and sea levels are rising, but on a hyperlocal basis, the quality of those predictions can be much better than it is,” Mr. Sorkin said. To create its flood maps, for instance, Jupiter looks not just at public data like satellite-based observations of rainfall and ocean currents, but also how changes in the urban landscape affect how water flows through cities. It then aims to harness recent advances in cloud-based supercomputing to combine that data with the latest climate model projections. The company’s scientists plan to continually test their forecasts against observations — to see, for instance, how well they predict flooding from major storms — and publish their research in scientific journals. In theory, the United States government could cobble much of this information together and present it in a usable way. But federal agencies tend to focus their resources on shorter-term weather predictions, and Congress has generally underfunded initiatives such as those at the Federal Emergency Management Agency to incorporate climate change into its federal flood maps. “If you want a full picture of flooding risk, you need expertise in weather, but also climate and hydrology and engineering and running complex models on the latest computer hardware,” Mr. Sorkin said. “All of those specialized disciplines are usually heavily siloed within the public sector or the scientific community.” Jupiter’s scientists will have to grapple with a number of technical challenges. While current climate models can provide broad statistical projections of how average temperatures and rainfall patterns are likely to shift across large regions over the coming century, it remains difficult to predict such shifts precisely over shorter time scales — which is what companies are often most concerned about. “Forecasting at 10-20 year time periods is perhaps the most difficult period to forecast,” Simon Mason, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society who is not involved with Jupiter, wrote in an email. “If that is not enough, trying to predict severe weather events rather than long-term averages is even harder still!” Past efforts to provide what are known as “climate services” have struggled with this issue. In 2009, the German government established the Climate Service Center to provide information about global warming risks to cities and businesses. But Guy P. Brasseur, a climate scientist who helped start the center, said potential clients were often disappointed with the uncertainty in the resulting forecasts. “One airline wanted to know how often the airport in Frankfurt would be closed because of snowstorms next year,” Dr. Brasseur said. “We were unable to answer a question like that.” Jupiter, which acknowledges the uncertainties in climate forecasting, will have to prove that a market exists. But at least one firm in the insurance industry sees potential value in the company’s approach, particularly after flooding and other disasters caused $306 billion in damages last year in the United States and record losses by insurers. “That certainly raised the stakes in terms of trying to get the best possible science on your side when you’re pricing risk,” said John Drzik, president of global risk at Marsh, one of the world’s largest commercial insurance brokers, which is currently in talks with Jupiter to explore what types of data and risk analyses might be most useful to its clients. Mr. Drzik noted that many of the traditional catastrophic risk models used by the insurance industry are rooted largely in historical data and don’t always grapple fully with how climate change could shift those risks in the future. While his company is still evaluating whether Jupiter’s climate-oriented models are useful enough to be worth paying for, “it grabbed us as something that had a lot of promise.” As global warming advances, experts say that governments will ultimately have to invest more in their own local climate prediction tools to help cities and industries adapt. But they also see a role for private climate forecasters, much as weather companies have sprung up to supplement the work the National Weather Service does. “The federal government could be doing a lot more,” said James L. Buizer, who studies climate adaptation at the University of Arizona. “But there’s still an important role for the private sector. If companies are going to benefit from this information, they ought to be paying for it. After all, it’s their infrastructure that’s going to get trashed.”","The Battery area of Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016.

BLAKE NICHOLSON / AP,"Blizzard warnings were posted from Colorado to Minnesota on Wednesday and wildfires were a concern in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma as the second so-called “bomb cyclone” storm in less than a month hit the central U.S., raising the prospect of renewed flooding in the already drenched Midwest.
Up to 2 ½ feet (0.61 meters) of snow was expected to fall in parts of eastern South Dakota and southwestern Minnesota, the National Weather Service said. Winds in excess of 50 mph (80.46 kph) also were expected, creating life-threatening conditions.
“We’re calling it historic because of the widespread heavy snow. We will set some records,” said Mike Connelly, a weather service meteorologist in Aberdeen, South Dakota.
Snow was already falling at a rate of up to 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) per hour in northeastern South Dakota and southwestern Minnesota on Wednesday, with the brunt of the storm not expected until Thursday. Sheriff’s offices in the northeastern South Dakota counties of Hamlin and Deuel advised no travel through Thursday, saying visibility was down to a few feet, roads were becoming impassable and numerous traffic crashes had been reported. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.
An unusual but not rare weather phenomenon known as “thunder snow” — snow accompanied by thunder and lightning — was reported in central South Dakota.
“It’s essentially a thunderstorm, but it’s cold enough for snow,” Connelly said.
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem closed state government offices in 52 counties. Numerous schools around the state closed, along with several Black Hills National Forest offices in western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said “the National Guard stands ready” to rescue any stranded motorists.
The weather service posted an ice storm warning into Friday morning for a portion of southern Minnesota, saying up to three-fourths of an inch of ice could accumulate on power lines, leading to outages.
To the west, the looming spring blizzard in the Rockies was impacting everything from flights to school classes to baseball.
About 40 percent of Denver International Airport’s daily flights Wednesday were scratched. Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies postponed an afternoon game against the Atlanta Braves until August. A few school districts in Colorado and Wyoming canceled classes, while others opted for a shortened day and canceled evening activities.
Strong winds associated with the weather system were creating dangerous wildfire and travel conditions in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. The weather service issued a high wind warning for the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles.
Winds in excess of 50 mph (80.46 kph) were combining with low humidity and an unstable atmosphere to create critical fire conditions in the three states. Forecasters in New Mexico said the winds also would make travel difficult on north-south oriented roads such as Interstate 25. In southern New Mexico, the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range closed Wednesday because of the high winds.
The storm technically met the scientific definition of what’s commonly known as a “bomb cyclone,” said David Roth, a forecaster at the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.
The weather phenomenon with a complex scientific definition essentially entails a rapid drop in air pressure and a storm strengthening explosively. What is more important than the term is the storm’s impacts, which are likely to be similar to last month’s storm , Roth said.
That blast dropped heavy snow and led to massive flooding in the Midwest that caused billions of dollars in damage in Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa and South Dakota.
“Hopefully this time it will be a slow snowmelt,” Roth said.
Forecasters said this week’s storm will swell rivers again, though likely not to the levels seen last month due to the absence of a wet snowpack on frozen ground this time around.
“We’re not out of the woods,” Walz said.
Even moderate rises in the Missouri River will push more water into drenched Fremont County in southwestern Iowa, Emergency Manager Mike Crecelius said. Last month’s flooding swamped 455 houses and thousands of acres of farmland in his region.
“The problem is that we’re not getting any time for the water to recede and things to dry out, so the levees can’t be fixed; houses can’t be fixed; crops can’t be planted,” he said. “And the last spring forecast I saw does not look favorable for us at all. It looks to be a very wet spring.”

Map shows the projected path of Hurricane Florence as of 11am, Sept. 13, 2018. -- Around 11 p.m. local time, the storm was about 50 miles south of Morehead City, North Carolina, and 60 miles east-southeast of Wilmington. Florence was progressing northwest at about 6 mph. Earlier, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration observing site at Cape Lookout, North Carolina, reported sustained winds of 83 mph and a gust of 106 mph. -- Though the storm, once a Category 4, was downgraded Thursday night to a Category 1 from a Category 2, the danger is very real. Parts of North Carolina may see as much as 40 inches of rain and storm surges could be as high as 13 feet. ""Flooding and the storm surge -- those are the two main things that kill people, and this storm is not letting up,"" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Thursday.

Graham Rapier,"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as the market closes in New York, U.S., October 3, 2016. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson You've probably heard the term ETF by now, but may not be sure what it actually means. Short for exchange-traded fund, ETFs have taken financial markets by storm over the past decade by packaging multiple individual equities into a single, indexed security that can be traded just like a stock. In just one trade, an investor can buy equity in a whole basket of individual securities, and — hopefully — receive the same rate of return as if they had bought them individually. In most years, that works out better than giving your money to an active investment manager — because most managers, notoriously, underperform the market as a whole. Today, more funds are traded on the major exchanges than individual equities, allowing investors to bet on wide swaths of the market, specific sectors like tech and banks, or even cryptocurrencies. What's more, ETF indexes now represent 25% to 30% of trading volume on any given day, according to the Financial Times. Here's a look at how much money investors have poured into the space in the past 12 years: Deutsche Bank Business Insider spoke to two experts — Brian Kelly, a hedge fund manager and CNBC contributor, and Greg King, a 15-year veteran of the derivatives space and founder of REX Shares — about their new cryptocurrency ETF and how investors can add similar funds to their portfolios. For starters, buying an ETF is as simple as buying a stock, and can be an easier way to add diversity to your portfolio rather than buying a ton of individual securities, King explains. Most major brokerages, from fee-free ones like Robinhood to more sophisticated sites like TD Ameritrade, offer hundreds of ETFs. TD Ameritrade even offers a handful of them without commissions. ""ETFs used to be a tool that was primarily aimed at advisers,"" King said in a recent interview with Business Insider. ""They were wonky and appealed to people who were very fee conscious and believe that diversification is the only free lunch. That hasn't changed, but whats' been bolted on to that now is the migration to self-directed investors, people who are running their own portfolios."" An amateur investor, or someone trading without the backing of a full institutional trading floor, might have trouble accessing complex financial products, like those linked to the volatility index — or VIX — or products that are leveraged in a bid to amplify returns, sometimes up to three times. In this case, if the underlying securities rose 1% in a trading day, the funds return could be 3%. ""I can only handle so many clients in terms of the hedge fund,"" Kelly, who founded the BKCM hedge fund and manages REX Shares' cryptocurrency ETF which launched this year, said in a recent interview. ""So the ETF gives an opportunity to give everybody what I think is a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity. our ethos is about taking strategies that might be either difficult to access or overly complex for people to put on by themselves and package them into one ticker that people can access."" ETFs are also generally cheaper than a a mutual fund, and much cheaper than a hedge fund's traditional 2-and-20 fee structure, meaning the manager skims 2% of the managed assets along with 20% of profits. The average expense ratio for an ETF is 0.44%, according to data from Morningstar, meaning the index provider will collect $4.40 for every $100 you invest each year. That's likely a lot cheaper than buying a basket of equities individually — and is possible without a margin account or complex derivatives, according to King. ""With ETFs, you really remove the security selection decision,"" King said. ""You just say I want this sector and boom you get 50 names.""

Sheri Fink,"W ayne Dailey sat in a waiting area at a Houston hospital, anxious for word about his wife. He and his sister stared at the television to distract themselves. It was Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2017, and broadcasters described a large storm moving off the Yucatán Peninsula with Texas in its sights, potentially bringing historic flooding to Houston that weekend. Wayne, who as a child in Galveston County spent hours watching the cloudscapes drift over the Gulf of Mexico, kept multiple weather apps on his phone and had already been tracking the storm. “It’s going to get us,” he told his sister. But coastal storms were a part of life that he had prepared for, and they did not concern him. He was more worried about his wife. Casey Dills-Dailey was undergoing surgery to remove the adrenal gland above her left kidney. The surgeon predicted an uncomplicated operation, conducted through tiny incisions. Still, Wayne wondered, would the surgery do what it was supposed to do? Was the doctor as skilled as he said he was? It was hard to grasp that the life of his 38-year-old wife could be endangered. The operation came after years of mysterious symptoms that began when Casey was in her early 30s. She had hot flashes and eventually stopped menstruating. Her face became chubby, and her full-but-shapely figure ballooned to nearly 250 pounds, fattening in odd places, including the space between her shoulders. Ugly red marks appeared on her abdomen. The illness left her in pain, nauseated and unable to stand for more than 15 minutes at a time. Casey Dills-Dailey talking about her health issues on March 26, 2016. Casey would scour books and the internet to help others solve medical or legal problems — Wayne, 39, called her a doctor without a degree — but the cause of her own health issues had eluded her. She blamed herself, ascribing her weight gain to overeating. Finally, in late March, after an ambulance took her to the hospital for a bout of severe abdominal pain, doctors detected a mass on one of her adrenal glands. Weeks of tests produced a diagnosis: Cushing’s syndrome, a curable but potentially deadly disorder caused by an overabundance of cortisol, a steroid hormone. The mass appeared on a 2015 scan for kidney stones, doctors realized, but because it is a common and typically nonproblematic finding, its significance was missed. Casey was referred to Dr. Curtis Wray, a surgical oncologist, to remove what doctors suspected was a noncancerous tumor that was releasing extra cortisol, causing her Cushing’s syndrome. The diagnosis helped explain many of her problems, from high blood pressure to erratic moods. Casey could not wait to look and feel like herself again. That morning, a resident surgeon said Casey should expect to stay three or four days for recovery. He described the operation’s potential complications — bleeding, infection, damage to other organs — which frightened Wayne. Dr. Wray, the senior surgeon, came in and reassured them. His team had performed the operation many times. Surprising Wayne and Casey, he predicted she would be home in 24 hours. Wayne asked to see the tumor when it was out. After surgery, Dr. Wray called him from the waiting area and showed him an image on his phone. The tumor was the width of Wayne’s two thumbs put together. Most important, to the surgeon it appeared benign. After Casey was settled in her hospital room, Wayne drove home to spend the night with their two sons. The family lived outside the Houston city limits in northeast Harris County, in a trailer park where homes stretched along fancifully named streets — Drifting Winds, Island Song and theirs, Enchanted Path Drive. The Daileys were what Wayne called a “simple, simple family”: Casey, a housewife who home-schooled their oldest son, Luke, 14; their youngest son, Ronnie, 10; and Wayne himself, a “middle-class worker, a lower-class worker,” without a steady job. For more than a dozen years, he had operated heavy machinery at oil refineries, clawing trenches into the earth for foundations and pipe racks. The finances were in his wife’s name in case he did not make it home. He had survived explosions, survived co-workers. Lately, he had been working for a friend’s tree-service firm. Casey made their uncertain income stretch, scrapping junk metal and advertising homemade quilts for $50 on social media; it took her about a week to make each one. Their trailer-park community had its drugs and gangs and violence, the evening cracks of gunfire and whining sirens. But four generations of family members and friends filled the homes on their block. Casey’s parents lived across the street, next to her aunt. Three homes over, there was Casey’s grandma’s bowling partner. Next door was Erasmo Villa, from Mexico, who with his brother-in-law had drywalled the Daileys’ home free of charge just because they were neighbors, and neighbors help each other. Casey cultivated roses that bloomed from pale pink to vivid red, growing impossibly high. Casey grew up in the trailer. Her mother had many miscarriages before giving birth to her only child, and Casey quickly took a place at the center of the family, clinging like a bear to her grandpa’s neck. As an adult, she cared for him and other sick relatives until they died. Having little money did not mean the Daileys could not be generous. Casey joined the homeowners’ board, chaperoned school field trips and led a Cub Scout troop with Wayne because nobody else volunteered. An evicted family with three children had slept on pallets on the Daileys’ living-room floor. Wayne and Casey served as temporary guardians for one of Ronnie’s friends so he wouldn’t be sent to a foster home during his parents’ rough patch. Their Wi-Fi password evinced their Christian faith: 12loveGod. That night after Casey’s operation, Wayne picked up the boys from their grandparents’ trailer. He ate dinner, put the television on in the bedroom and fell asleep. At around 9:30 the next morning, Casey called him from the hospital. “Come up here,” she said. They were discharging her. Tropical Storm Harvey was rapidly strengthening in the gulf, and Wayne stopped to pick up necessities. When he walked into the imposing hospital in the early afternoon, though, nothing looked amiss. In truth, doctors at Casey’s hospital, Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center, were preparing for a possible hurricane, sending stable patients home. During Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, Memorial Hermann, with 540 patients inside, lost power and was evacuated, as medical workers manually squeezed air into the lungs of patients whose mechanical respirators had failed. Since then, billions of dollars had been spent to protect the hospital and other facilities at the Texas Medical Center campus. A surgical intern just weeks out of medical school examined Casey. He prepared discharge instructions and wrote two prescriptions: one for a stool softener and the other for 40 tablets of Tramadol, an opioid painkiller. He did not prescribe steroids, which would typically be needed when a steroid-producing tumor like Casey’s was removed. A nurse went over the bright-orange folder of information, explaining how to keep the incisions clean to avoid infection and emphasizing the importance of being as active as possible to help prevent a potentially deadly blood clot from forming in her legs or lungs. Casey was to follow up with Dr. Wray in a week. She arrived home that afternoon in pain and ready for a nap. Casey’s aunt from across the street texted to offer help and asked whether Casey and Wayne were ready for the hurricane. Casey responded that they would fill containers with water, hunker down and keep an eye on their outdoor dogs. “It’s all we can do.” Late the next night, Friday, Harvey barreled into the Texas coastline northeast of Corpus Christi as a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest to strike the United States in over a decade. It stalled, losing strength but absorbing more water from the gulf, before pinwheeling into Houston. The view of the storm from Wayne Dailey's porch on Saturday night, Aug. 26, 2017. On Saturday night, before 10 p.m., Wayne opened his screen door, stepping barefoot onto the stoop to look at what was coming. Wind chimes tinkled, and the roof dripped a steady beat of rain between crashes of thunder. Branches tipped with small red flowers swayed dizzily above the door. A shock of lightning brought the trees into sudden light. Less than an hour later, he opened the door again to a hiss of sheeting rain that obscured the rumble of thunder. Behind him in the house, an emergency alert blared from one of their mobile phones, a flash-flood warning: “Imminent Threat — Severe.” A s the storm strengthened, emergency officials appeared to have the situation well in hand. Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, had warned that Harvey would be a “major rainmaker” for the city and asked people to stay off the roads over the weekend, but he did not call for an evacuation — he later told reporters that sending millions of people fleeing onto the highways would be “asking for a major calamity.” In 2005, more than half of the county’s population drove out ahead of Hurricane Rita, just weeks after Hurricane Katrina. Traffic stalled, gas tanks ran dry and dozens of residents died on the freeways from the heat, vehicle-fire injuries, traffic accidents and delayed medical attention. Then Rita swerved and missed Houston. Harris County’s top elected official, Judge Ed Emmett, also decided that there should be no mass evacuations. With a population of more than 4.5 million — about equal numbers outside and inside Houston — Harris County’s roughly 1,700 square miles held more people than half of the states in the country. Texas law requires every jurisdiction to have plans for managing emergencies, and as the lead county official, Judge Emmett served as its emergency-management chief. On Sunday, he was based at the county’s emergency operations center, in the Houston TranStar building, which houses Harris County’s lead agency for disasters, the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. As the storm moved into the area, the activity in the vast headquarters picked up. Personnel from various agencies gathered at rows of desks, their partitions marked by edge-lit glass signs with the office logo glowing an eerie white. Just below the room’s high ceilings, giant video screens played the news and tracked weather. Webbed with rivers, creeks, lakes, bayous and reservoirs, Harris County had experienced a notable increase in severe, storm-induced floods in recent years. Storms in 2015 and 2016 killed more than a dozen people and swamped parts of the “500 year” floodplain — an area that according to previous models had only a 0.2 percent chance of flooding in a given year. Climate experts predicted that the trend would continue as the atmosphere warmed and extreme weather rose in frequency and intensity. The built environment worsened the problem: Concrete covered ever more miles of rainfall-absorbing prairieland, and sewers and ditches were designed by the local government to overflow into the streets, which were considered part of the drainage system. This helped protect homes and businesses from flooding, but it could trap their inhabitants when streets became canals. A dizzying array of agencies participated in emergency response, coordinating their activities using the National Incident Management System, a protocol that arose from efforts to jointly battle wildfires in the 1970s and that was adopted nationally after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The concept was simple: Disaster response, and the responsibility for it, started at the point of impact and moved out and up as resources were overwhelmed. Individual and local-community preparedness — stocking food, water and medicines and looking out for neighbors — was the initial safeguard. The 911 system was the next, connecting people with police, fire, rescue and emergency medical assistance. The circle expanded from there. If one of the county’s 54 independent fire departments, which were responsible for water rescues, found itself overwhelmed, it could reach out to the fire desk at the county emergency operations center in the TranStar building, which could request assistance from other local fire stations or from representatives of the Coast Guard or the Federal Emergency Management Agency sitting nearby. Health and medical services had a separate hierarchy of support agencies. When Harvey reached Harris County, beginning to release what became a once-in-a-thousand-years rainfall of more than 1 trillion gallons, officials were confident they could prioritize people in life-threatening situations. But as the water rose on Sunday, it overwhelmed those preparations. Many local fire departments lacked boats or trucks that could handle flooded streets, and those that had them could no longer share. A Houston police sergeant drowned in his vehicle trying to drive to work. The flooding was so widespread that it impeded the arrival of additional state and federal teams. At TranStar, officials felt agitated and helpless. They were getting personal emails appealing for rescues, sometimes with photographs of elderly relatives attached. There was no time to wait. “I got a crazy idea,” Rodney Reed, the assistant chief for operational support for the Harris County Fire Marshal’s Office, said as Judge Emmett walked into a snack-filled room. “I need you to support it.” Reed argued that they should invite unaffiliated volunteers into the rescue effort. According to conventional wisdom, they get in the way and often end up needing help themselves. But Reed assured the judge that taking the step would save lives. And so at noon on Sunday, Judge Emmett stepped to a lectern before news cameras to make an unusual statement. A large screen looped colorful radar images of the storm behind him. “Those of you who have boats and high-water vehicles that can be used in neighborhoods to help move people out of harm’s way, we need your help,” he said. “Government assets are fully utilized.” Judge Emmett asked the public to call the emergency operations center if they were willing to volunteer. County officials wrote each offer on a sticky note or scrap of paper, affixing it to a wall with blue tape in neat rows according to geographic quadrants, ready to be pulled whenever a fire department called requesting boats. The perhaps-even-greater challenge was connecting the volunteers to the people who needed rescuing. Callers had trouble getting through to 911 as the volume of calls for assistance more than quadrupled. Judge Emmett asked people to stop calling unless they faced immediate danger. “The phone lines are backed up,” he said. Like most other emergency agencies, the Coast Guard, which controlled many boats and helicopters, had not prepared to respond to distress signals posted on the public’s technologies of choice: Facebook and Twitter. Instead, it used social media to disseminate five emergency numbers for the local Coast Guard station, setting up a separate, parallel dispatch system for residents in need of rescue. In a sign of the ad hoc nature of the triage system, personnel tracked urgent medical cases with a pencil-and-paper checklist. In its postings, the Coast Guard instructed people to mark their roofs or “wave sheets, towels etc.” to get rescuers’ attention. Identifying who needed help the most was the crucial first step to responders saving lives. During the county’s news conference, authorities sent a wireless emergency alert to cellular customers, including Wayne and Casey: “Call 911 for LIFE THREATENING emergencies ONLY. STAY PUT IF SAFE.” The view from Wayne's porch on Sunday morning, Aug. 27. W ayne felt safe. He had renovated, moving electrical equipment from underneath the trailer into the attic. The yard angled down into the street. He had purchased plenty of food, and he filled the bathtub and washing machine with water. His family, like Texas, could stand on its own. If there had ever been a time to evacuate, this was not it. That morning, a man named Samuel Saldivar had driven into the neighborhood about a mile south of the Daileys’ home to rescue his parents, who had Alzheimer’s disease. He loaded them and four of their great-grandchildren into a large white van and crossed a small bridge over Greens Bayou after sunrise. The bayou had often swamped bridges along its path, and officials had recognized the need to improve it. As Saldivar came off the bridge, the rising waters swept the van from the road. Saldivar was able to escape, and clung to a tree for the better part of an hour. The local fire service, Sheldon Community Fire and Rescue, had no boats. The sheriff’s deputies arrived with one and, with a local firefighter, rescued Saldivar. But the van, with everyone else still trapped inside, was now submerged. The rescuers’ boat, not fit for swift water, could not reach it. Saldivar’s parents, two great-nieces and two great-nephews all drowned. Throughout Sunday, brown water continued to fill Enchanted Path Drive. By the afternoon, the floodwaters reached Wayne and Casey’s garden. Luke asked his father if the flooding was going to kill the grass, or the rose bush, or the plants in the yard. Wayne said no. He also cut off the boy’s restless entreaties to wade across the street, where Casey’s aunt’s car now stood parked in water to the top of its wheels. “Be smart,” Wayne snapped. “Not like these people over here.” He gestured at neighbors tracing a milky brown path toward the main road, submerged to their upper thighs and carrying umbrellas. “You don’t know what’s in that water,” Wayne said. As Wayne monitored the flooding, he also kept an eye on Casey. Her pain had quickly become far more severe than anticipated. The Tramadol was not helping, and a months-old injury to her hip and leg was making it even more difficult to get up and move. She grew queasy shortly after Wayne removed an anti-nausea medication patch from behind her ear as instructed, three days after it had been applied at the hospital. Having coped with bouts of vomiting for years, Casey had the drug Zofran at the ready, and it seemed to help for a few hours at a time. The view from Wayne's porch on Sunday evening, Aug. 27. On Sunday her temperature was slightly higher than normal. Wayne’s father, a former volunteer fire chief with some training in emergency care, explained by phone how to check her incisions for signs of infection like redness, swelling or pus. They looked fine. When she woke up, she even took a few phone calls, including robocalls with updates from Luke’s home-school academy and Ronnie’s elementary school. As the sky deepened into gray on Sunday evening, Wayne padded to the door in his bare feet and jeans. Rain dripped from the trees, drawing expanding circles in the dim water that now covered their lowest step. A man in a blue baseball cap, his shirt rolled up below his chest, waved as he waded by, water above his buttocks, pushing a small, round raft with a woman inside it. “You ought to go out,” he warned. Wayne chortled, unconvinced. “Y’all be careful,” he responded. On Facebook Live, Wayne repeated the message officials were spreading. “If you’re safe where you’re at, stay where you’re at. If you have to get out, get out.” He reassured his anxious mother on Facebook. “We are safe.” Wayne did not like to worry anyone. He had done enough of that when he was young, partying hard and spending time in jail for marijuana possession as a teenager. Marrying Casey and becoming a father had helped transform him. They went to high school together, but did not know each other well. When they met again a few years later, she electrified him. The young woman with the long brown hair had a radiance that drew him. He couldn’t not look at her. She was the girlfriend of his friend next door. He told himself he would marry her one day. As the waters rose Sunday night, Wayne stayed up with Casey, who could not stop vomiting. “Something ain’t right,” Casey said. On Monday morning, it continued raining, and the muddy water rose to their top step, just below the front door. Casey had finally fallen asleep, and when Wayne checked on her, he found it hard to keep her awake. Audio has been edited for brevity. Around 1:30 in the afternoon, Wayne called 911. In Harris County, 911 calls were routed based on geography to one of several primary “public safety answering points,” or PSAPs — independently managed call centers that were most typically housed in local police departments. He reached the answering point for calls outside Houston in unincorporated Harris County, at the Harris County sheriff’s office. He told the woman who answered that Casey had recently had surgery. “She has been very sick. She’s been vomiting for the past day and a half approximately, and she’s in severe pain. And I don’t want her to get in this water in her sutures. She needs to get airlifted to a hospital.” This was not a police emergency, so the communications officer transferred the call to a secondary PSAP, which would determine the next steps. The phone rang 10 times over the course of about a minute, much longer than usual. Another woman picked up, speaking quickly. “Fire and ambulance.” After giving his address and confirming that he needed a water rescue, Wayne said that Casey had recently had surgery and had been vomiting for a day and a half. The second call-taker interrupted him. There were over a thousand calls for help, she said. “As soon as the fire department is able to make it to this area then you will be evacuated.” T he second call-taker had made an important decision, based on incomplete information. She noted Casey’s vomiting and recent surgery, but she did not know that Casey was in severe pain, or barely conscious, or that Wayne thought she needed an airlift to a hospital. The first call-taker stayed on the phone after the second call-taker picked up, but — counter to national guidelines for 911 call-takers — she did not intervene to ensure that the second call-taker had the missing information on Casey’s medical condition. And so the second call-taker entered Wayne’s call into the computer system as one requiring water rescue from the local fire department, not urgent medical response from the local E.M.S. service, which was a separate agency. The job of a 911 call-taker is emotionally and technically demanding at the best of times. During Harvey, the stress was extraordinary. The overloaded call center where the second call-taker was working, Harris County Emergency Corps, served roughly a dozen independent fire and ambulance services in the county. The corps had doubled its staff to eight from four for the storm, but call volume had more than tripled. Every one of the six 911 lines and additional non-emergency lines was ringing nonstop. Personnel were working 12-hour shifts and sleeping in the building and a nearby hotel. Someone had posted the center’s direct-dial phone numbers on Twitter, and it was now receiving calls from other parts of the county, requiring phone transfers that took up to 20 minutes. The center did something it had never done before. Its leaders walked to the call floor and told call-takers to bypass the formal triaging system that it normally used to assign emergency-priority codes to callers. Instead, they would log the call for water rescue and read a script saying that there were many calls and that the fire department would respond as soon as it could. The sheriff’s communications division, which handled primary calls, also faced severe challenges. The basement had filled up with water from Buffalo Bayou, causing power failures. Its staff moved to a regional 911 training center, the only available backup location with a connection to the physical 911 network. After the move, key technical functions stopped working, including, for a time, the internal dispatch system.

Corps According to data provided by the sheriff’s office, the proportion of 911 calls answered within an industry target of 10 seconds plummeted. On Sunday, more than 40 percent of 911 callers to the sheriff’s office hung up during the long waits, according to internal email records from the regional 911 network provider. That further increased the load on communicators, who typically had to follow up on the so-called “abandoned” calls. In Houston the problem was even worse — of the nearly 40,000 calls, more than half ended in hang-ups. Why couldn’t the overburdened centers simply press a few buttons to redirect 911 calls to unaffected centers elsewhere? At the heart of the problem was an astonishing fact: A majority of 911 systems in the United States use primarily analog, rather than digital, technology. Until recently, even the ability to text 911 for help has been rare. Government and industry experts agree on the need to upgrade to so-called next-generation 911 systems that are Internet Protocol-based and can be designed to redistribute calls automatically in a crisis. While some entire countries have completed the upgrades, relatively few areas in the United States have. Vermont was among the first, and it seamlessly transferred calls after Hurricane Irene in 2011 from a flooded communications center to call-takers at centers outside the area of impact — who had maps, data and uniform training to help them handle calls from unfamiliar areas. Oversight of 911 is fragmented among states and localities, systems are often poorly funded and there is no national mandate to upgrade. By the time it is widely adopted, experts say, next-generation 911 technology itself may well be obsolete. Harris County had been in the process of updating its technology for 10 years when Harvey struck, but the new system would not be operational until February of this year. Wayne knew none of that, though. Nor did he know that Casey had not been tagged as an urgent medical case. W hile he waited for the fire department, Wayne spent Monday afternoon exploring every other option he could think of, including the list of emergency numbers the Coast Guard Sector Houston-Galveston command released the previous day. He kept the porch light on and, as some had advised online, hung a towel out a window and another over the screen door to alert potential rescuers. With his cellphone service cutting in and out, he managed to reach an area hospital to say that Casey would be on the way as soon as responders arrived. The person who answered assured him that the hospital was accepting patients. Wayne told his family he was thinking of pushing Casey through the water on an inflatable mattress. They thought it was a bad idea. That evening, as it continued to rain, Wayne heard an airboat passing by his house and tried to flag down its driver, who had earmuffs on to protect against the earsplitting engine noise. The man slowed down when he saw Wayne in the doorway standing next to Ronnie. “My wife and my kids and I need out!” Wayne shouted to the man. “My wife needs help. She has a medical condition.” The man said he was on the way to pick someone up and would get Wayne and his family on the way back. “Just stay right there.” Casey was in the bedroom with the television on, lethargic and in pain. Wayne gave her the news, and she nodded. Wayne stuffed clothing, dry towels and rain jackets into bags. He let family members know that an airboat was coming for them, and his sister posted the news on his Facebook page. “I’m glad he didn’t swim out,” one of his oldest friends wrote. Wayne told everyone he loved them. “We are going to be O.K.,” he wrote around 7 p.m., and then turned on Facebook Live. “As we wait for the airboat to come back for us, I’ll just show y’all what it looks like,” he said. It was raining, but the water level had stopped rising. “Airboats will be here any time now,” Wayne said. A droning sound in the background grew louder. “Matter of fact, I think I hear them now, so I’m going to go ahead and end the video,” he said. Wayne leaned out his front door to look at the main road, which was five trailer lots away at the end of their street. The airboat came into view. But instead of turning onto Enchanted Path Drive to pick them up, it continued on to wherever it was heading. Wayne felt a wave of panic, but he tried to keep his composure for his kids. He wanted them to feel sure that their father would get them out of there. Minutes later, their home lost power. The television news switched off along with the Wi-Fi, which the boys were using to watch videos. It would be night soon, and Wayne could see that the homes of their remaining neighbors were also dark. Wayne turned off Casey’s fully powered cellphone to conserve its battery. His own phone could last nearly a day, and he had an external battery to extend it for another. Late into the night, he called and texted every number that his family and friends sent him to reach volunteer rescuers. He placed calls to a number for the Cajun Navy, an ad hoc volunteer group. He called strangers and took calls from strangers. By midnight, he believed Casey had been added to about a half-dozen rescue lists. But most rescue operations, both official and unofficial, had shut down for the night for safety. Casey was still running a slight fever. Wayne checked her incisions again. They still looked good. He tried to reassure worried friends and family members. “It will be tomorrow,” he wrote on Facebook. “I have Casey stable for now. I have everyone sleeping. I am going to get some rest. I only had about an hour of sleep in about 28 hours. Love you guys and will keep y’all posted.” A few minutes before sunrise on Tuesday, Wayne called 911 for the second time. It had been a bad night. Casey’s movements were shaky, and when she tried to speak, her words were mostly gibberish. Just as with his first call, he was transferred to a call-taker at Harris County Emergency Corps. “Fire and ambulance,” she said quickly and sneezed. Wayne explained about Casey and her recent surgery. He said they needed a water rescue. The flooding in the street was six feet deep. The call-taker, sounding groggy, asked if his home was flooded. “I’ve been blessed, no water in it,” he said. She told Wayne that many neighborhoods in his area had to be evacuated. “As of right now they haven’t resumed water-rescue operations,” she said. The fire department would do so at daylight. She had Wayne’s phone number for them, and they would get to him as soon as possible. “O.K., thank you very much,” Wayne said. But the 911 center did not assign any personnel or resources, and the call-taker once again categorized the incident as a water-rescue call to be sent to the local fire department, not a medical emergency for the E.M.S. agency. The local fire service, Sheldon Community Fire and Rescue, was in charge of rescues. But Sheldon owned no boats or high-water vehicles and it had flooded out one of its fire engines. The day before the flooding began, Sheldon personnel responded to five incidents, a typical number. On Sunday the number of calls shot up to more than 170, nearly all of them requests for water rescues as opposed to reports of fires; roughly 40 more calls came in for addresses already in the system — people who had called for help and then called back after they did not get assistance. The fire desk at the emergency operations center had little it could offer. It gave the cellphone numbers of Sheldon Fire chiefs to civilian volunteers with boats, which was helpful but also added to the logistical burden. On Sunday night, Sheldon Fire and Rescue leaders called the 911 center to say that the service lacked resources to conduct water rescues, especially at night. Instead of dispatching calls one by one to the handful of Sheldon Fire and Rescue crews, the 911 center put those calls into a holding pattern. Fire captains could access the ever-lengthening list on a mobile data terminal in their cars. On Monday, new calls for rescue in the district arrived on average every minute to two minutes. By the time of Wayne’s 911 call that day, Sheldon Fire had already received more than 500 water-rescue calls, not counting duplicates. The triage method was haphazard. Sometimes if a call sounded urgent, a 911 dispatcher would text or phone District Capt. Isaac Pinson, saying, “Hey, man, can you get to this?” Pinson said later that whenever possible, he read the dispatchers’ notes and, by radio from his Tahoe truck, prioritized sending fire crews on fishermen’s boats to homes where lives were in danger, or to areas with the greatest concentration of flooding. Sometimes a personal contact helped identify someone needing rescue. One crew went to get family members of a Texas state trooper out of their house. The chaos created considerable wasted effort. Captain Pinson sent personnel to rescue people who became stuck on flooded streets after wading out of homes where they could have stayed safely. His crews lost precious time responding to false alarms, including a report that the roof of the local high school had collapsed with hundreds of people sheltering inside. For the most part, Captain Pinson concluded, people clamoring to get out of their homes were just scared, not at risk of drowning or dying of a medical emergency. Audio has been edited for brevity. At daylight on Tuesday, Wayne saw that the water level outside had dropped slightly. He could barely rouse Casey. He tried calling the Texas Department of Public Safety and, failing to reach someone who could help, called 911 a third time. “I need a medical-emergency rescue,” he said with an edge to his voice he did not have before. The call-taker at the sheriff’s office asked him if it was because of flooding. Wayne said no and explained about Casey’s surgery and the last two days of vomiting. “She’s kind of unresponsive,” he said. When the call-taker said she would get an ambulance there, he said, “There’s no way” and explained that five or six feet of water still lay outside. “I’ve been trying for two days to get her out of here,” Wayne said. Emergency workers later reported that 911 dispatchers in Harris County had limited knowledge of impassable roads, including routes to local hospitals. Although dispatchers were kept abreast of major road closures, some could not use their terminals to access potentially useful websites like the state transportation department’s web page showing blocked roads, or even Google Maps. A next-generation 911 system that incorporates layers of multimedia information might help solve that problem in future disasters, perhaps even incorporating information from drone overflights. The communications officer at the sheriff’s office told Wayne that she would get an ambulance to him and instructed him to let the paramedic know the situation when the call transferred. A Harris County Emergency Corps call-taker picked up the call and asked for Wayne’s address. “O.K., we do already have your two calls for service,” the woman said. “My wife, she’s getting worse,” Wayne said. “She’s unresponsive, she’s real lethargic, she’s been vomiting. She’s in a lot of pain. And I really, really, really, really need to get her to a hospital A.S.A.P.” She told Wayne brusquely that there were thousands of calls for service in the area. “The fire department is working as quickly and safely as they can to get everybody out, O.K.? It’s just going to take some time for them to be able to get everybody, O.K.?” It wasn’t O.K., but Wayne said, “O.K.” Nineteen seconds into the call, the communicator closed the incident as a “duplicate” without assigning any responders, since Wayne’s previous call was already in the queue. Wayne called family members, and his mother commented on Facebook at 10 a.m., asking for help from anyone who could provide it. “Casey’s condition has worsened. She is feverish and unresponsive.” Audio has been edited for brevity. Wayne tried 911 again. This time, his call ended up in Houston. About one call in seven was misrouted by cell towers during the storm, a higher than normal rate, according to data obtained through a public-records request from the regional 911 network, Greater Harris County 911. Communicators had to stay on the line trying to transfer these misrouted calls, adding to the gridlock. The Houston call-taker rerouted Wayne to the Harris County Emergency Corps. This was now the fourth time Wayne had spoken to this center, and he could not have been clearer with the call-taker on the line when she asked him what he was reporting. “My wife is in urgent need of medical, medical attention,” he said, “she’s almost unresponsive.” At last, the call-taker classified the problem as a “31,” an unconscious party, rather than as someone in need of water rescue. “We’re getting medical to you as soon as they can get there,” she said. A fter 21 hours, Wayne’s call had moved out of the queue for the local fire service, which was responsible for water rescues, and was now in the hands of the independent local medical-response agency, South Lake Houston E.M.S., which was in charge of medical emergencies. Both of South Lake Houston’s two stations, the newer of which was now itself surrounded by water, were normally about a 10-minute drive from Wayne and Casey’s trailer. South Lake Houston covered a territory of around 70 square miles, much of it rural or industrial. A rotating staff of five paramedics and emergency medical technicians typically worked two 24-hour shifts per week and supplemented their income with other jobs, including with other ambulance services. Normally, they answered five or six calls a day. On Sunday, they were dispatched to 17 calls. On Monday, it was 39, and because of flooding they only reached two of them. Tuesday was looking to be even worse. The ambulance service had not staffed up before the crisis, and the flooding prevented some personnel from making it in for their shifts. Two paramedics who had worked two days straight in a nearby district drove in on Monday morning to help. From the beginning, the disaster had been harrowing for the paramedics. One crew sped in an ambulance toward a hospital downtown in the midst of the violent storm, with a critically ill patient on a ventilator. Floodwaters stopped them on the roadway. They tried hitching a ride three separate times with three different trucks, but the water was too high. Ultimately the paramedics lifted the woman into a volunteer’s kayak and walked her the last mile. The crew had to be flown by helicopter back to the station. Several times, the paramedics waded through water only to arrive where someone did not really need help. Once, they were dispatched to respond to a reported death and spent an hour canvassing a flooded neighborhood on foot, unable to locate the person. Sometimes they worked with the fishermen and pleasure-craft operators who formed an impromptu rescue network but were not trained or equipped to save lives. In the broader region, volunteers sometimes overturned in rough floodwaters (at least four ultimately drowned). By midday Monday, the E.M.S. service’s leaders concluded that, in the case of callers who were inaccessible by ambulance, it was best to keep track of their conditions and try to reach them only if they became critical. Joe Fress, the director, asked his personnel at the station to write out a list of all the medical calls that were listed as “pending” in the computer system, with locations and phone numbers. On Monday, one of those pending patients was Randy De’Shun Belcher, a 38-year-old man with diabetes who did not have his insulin with him. His fiancée, De’Licia Thomas, called 911 after midnight to report he was having difficulty breathing. “I’m sending the paramedics to help you now,” the call-taker at Harris County Emergency Corps said, and South Lake Houston E.M.S. was dispatched. Thomas called back when the ambulances did not arrive as promised. The call-taker incorrectly assured her that units were en route. “You gotta understand we’re going through a hurricane,” she said. The apartment complex was just off the Texas State Route 8 Beltway, which was not flooded. But the entrance to the apartment complex was under water, about 100 feet from the beltway’s frontage road, and not navigable by ambulance. Nobody called Thomas to let her know. Just after noon on Monday, Thomas tried 911 again. “He’s not breathing properly,” she said. She called again 90 minutes later. The call-taker sighed loudly, sounding exasperated as she took down the address. Thomas repeated what was happening, now sounding tired and dejected. At 5 p.m., still waiting, she again called 911 in tears to report that her fiancé was barely breathing. “O.K., I’m sending the paramedics to help you now,” a communicator again told Thomas. The call was coded in a way that indicated Belcher was getting sicker, which led Fress, finally, to tell his paramedics, “Let’s just try to get there, let’s try to make it.” They parked on the Beltway and grabbed gear and medications from the ambulance. They crossed the feeder road and entered the complex, the floodwaters rising to their waists in the parking lot. Their rescue equipment was splashed even as they held it aloft on their shoulders. Their boots grew heavy with water, and their hips ached. As they made their way, another 911 call-taker, speaking quickly but patiently, was giving Thomas’s mother, also in the home, instructions on how to start CPR. At 5:50 p.m., the paramedics finally walked into the apartment. Belcher, a father of 12, had been without a pulse and not breathing for at least a half an hour. The paramedics knew they would not get him back, but they also knew, for the sake of the devastated women, they had to try. The medical interventions did not work. The paramedics felt horrible that they could not save him, and that the medical examiner’s staff would not be able to get there to pick up Belcher’s body. They needed to do something they had never done before Harvey — they left Belcher’s body on the living-room floor with a breathing tube in his mouth and an intravenous catheter in his right arm so the medical examiner would know what they had done. Before they left, they covered Belcher with a bedsheet, knowing that Thomas might be stuck in the apartment with him for days before his body was retrieved. W ayne raised Casey from their bed and shuffled her in his arms to a recliner in the living room so she would be closer to the front door when help arrived. Ronnie and Luke sat, hushed and frightened, on the adjacent sofa. Before noon on Tuesday, Wayne heard the thrum of helicopter rotors and saw a rescue line being lowered behind the trailers two streets over. He burst through the back door, where the grade was higher, sloshed through water that reached his thighs and lifted an extension ladder against the side of the trailer. He climbed to the roof, shouting and waving a flashlight. Luke stood on the front steps signaling with a bright yellow broom. Ronnie hollered for his father from the back door, not knowing where he had gone. The helicopter moved toward them. It hovered overhead. Then it flew away. Wayne swore. He made a decision: He did not want his children to watch their mother die. “I’m going to bring y’all over there,” he told his boys, gesturing to Casey’s parents’ trailer across the street. “And I’m going to get Mommy out of here.” He carried little Ronnie, with Luke sloshing along beside them. Wayne had no idea for whom the helicopter had come, or how it had been dispatched, but he learned months later. Norma Anderson, 75, had kidney failure and, having missed dialysis, was in bad condition. A 911 communicator told her daughter that ambulances could not reach the neighborhood, and she would have to await fire-rescue crews. Fortunately for Norma, the owner of her trailer had a friend who knew the district’s congressman, Gene Green, and thought to call him. An intern in the representative’s Washington office, Simon Handler, took the call and phoned a federal agency for a helicopter, which soon arrived. Wayne returned from Casey’s parents’ house soaking wet. He changed his clothes and went back to Casey’s side, telling her over and over that help was coming. Shortly before 1 p.m., nearly a day after Wayne’s first 911 call, a paramedic from South Lake Houston E.M.S. called Wayne back. It was the only call Wayne’s cellphone recorded having received from the station, although paramedics later recalled talking with Wayne more than once to keep track of Casey’s condition. Greg Perches, a paramedic who said he spoke with Wayne, arrived at South Lake Houston E.M.S. on Monday night, which allowed the ambulance service to assemble a second crew. Wayne impressed him by saying he thought Casey was becoming septic, using a medical term that indicated a potentially deadly consequence of a severe infection. The county’s systems were supposed to prioritize people like Casey, people who “have a medical situation, even if they’re not in an area where flooding is life-threatening,” Francisco Sánchez, a deputy emergency-management coordinator for Harris County Homeland Security and Emergency Management, later said. Perches says his director, Joe Fress, phoned the county fire desk to see whether the county had resources to send to Wayne and Casey’s street, but was told it did not. By the logic of the county’s emergency-management plan for health and medical services, the ambulance service should have been able to call for assistance from a regional catastrophic medical operations center, which was in charge of coordinating patient evacuation, transport and placement. But that center did not have its own air or boat resources, and additional ambulances would have been of no use in reaching flooded areas. The ambulance companies had to rely on fire services to help them. But in South Lake Houston’s district, unlike in some other parts of Harris County, including Houston, fire and ambulance services were completely independent agencies. Although they were responsible for largely overlapping districts, Sheldon Fire and South Lake Houston E.M.S. did not follow recommendations to set up a joint command in response to the disaster, in part because there were so few workers available. Also, while personnel were individually friendly and respected each other, there was “bad blood from a long time ago” between the agencies, Sheldon Fire’s Captain Pinson says. “They don’t work with us that well.” Workers from both agencies would later agree that communications between them during the disaster were poor. Their radios were on different channels, and their calls were dispatched separately by the 911 center. That meant that when someone having a medical emergency was also trapped by floodwaters, the fire department would not necessarily know about it. The paramedics were fatalistic. “We were fortunate to get what we could get” in terms of outside help, says Billy Slagle, a supervisor at the E.M.S. service. Theirs is a “very small community,” he says, “who’s nobody.” Perches told Wayne to flag down any boat he could, both men later recalled. Right after the call, Wayne turned his phone to record Casey as she lay, flushed and barely conscious, on the recliner chair by the front door. He had heard on the news that people were making false reports when they called 911. He wanted to document that this was a true medical emergency, and that Casey needed help, in case anyone ever questioned him. “Casey?” Wayne asked as he recorded her. The feverish eyes of his wife flickered and focused. She made a sound that might have been the beginnings of the word, “What?” “Someone’s coming to help us, O.K.? I love you.” She groaned softly and turned her head away from him. “Just keep breathing, O.K.?” he said. Pearl Jam’s “Just Breathe” was their special song. It was 12:54 p.m. There was still no power, and light from the open door threw shadows across her reddened face as she lay on the easy chair. Outside, the flooding continued receding, but slowly. After he finished the short recording, Wayne heard a sound that made him look outside. He saw a tiny aluminum boat motoring past the house with two men in it. Wayne stood up and kicked the door open, shouting: “My wife is dying, man. I got to get her out of here.” T he men said they were from the Cajun Navy. They tied the boat to the handrail, came into the trailer and looked stunned when they saw Casey. “We’ve got to get her out of here now,” one of them said. They carried Casey to the boat and motored 300 feet to the drainage ditch at the corner of Enchanted Path Drive and John Ralston Road, where the street was dry. One man took off running to try to flag an airboat, waving his arms and screaming: “We got a medical emergency! We got a medical emergency!” Stephanie Vincent, a 37-year-old respiratory therapist from Kinder, La., was with a group of boat volunteers about a half-mile up the road and saw the man running in their direction. “They got something over there,” she said, and started running toward the man with several friends. One of the airboats they were with flew ahead of them. About a half-dozen men picked up Casey by her arms and legs and loaded her into the airboat. “Be careful of her left side,” Wayne warned them. Vincent and a medical student whose name nobody could later recall tried to get a history of Casey’s problems, but a glance told them all they needed to know. “This woman needs critical care right now,” the medical student said. “She’s fighting for her life, and she looks like she’s losing.” They headed to a nearby field free of power lines where a helicopter could land. A volunteer from Pasadena, Tex., tried calling a number he had found for the Coast Guard on Facebook or Zello, a walkie-talkie app that citizen rescuers were using. Other volunteers stood on a bridge where the road crossed a swollen channel, waving their brightly colored life jackets to try to flag passing helicopters. Vincent stood beside Casey, holding her hand and trying to talk to her. Casey was able to open her eyes and squeeze Vincent’s hand, but she could not speak aside from moaning. Casey was trembling, and Vincent took off her jackets to make a pillow. For the volunteers, the day to that point had been filled with waiting. They had slept in a Baptist church overnight and followed a member of the Cajun Navy to try to evacuate 275 people from a flooded trailer park. But when they reached the neighborhood, residents did not want to leave. The volunteer boat fleet had not managed to find anyone willing to be rescued until Wayne and Casey. Now Vincent felt there was a reason they were supposed to be there. She wished she had brought a monitor to check Casey’s oxygen level. Wayne kept hold of Casey’s hand and murmured encouragement to her. He repeatedly thanked the volunteers. “I’m so sorry,” Vincent said. She and her friends had waited hours for something useful to do. If they had known about Casey, they would have gone right to her. The man from Pasadena called again to check on the helicopter. There were several operating in the area, but all were fully loaded with passengers and would not be back for the better part of an hour. A half-hour passed, then more, with Vincent growing irritated and panicked. Why were they just sitting there? Casey was going to stop breathing and die if they did not get her somewhere. “Put her on our boat,” she told the others. Her idea was to take Casey back to the meeting point where the boats had launched that morning, at the Houston Motorsports Park, about three miles north off a major parkway. Two Texas Department of Transportation high-water dump-truck crews had been parked there for hours, waiting to transport evacuees. Several volunteers lifted Casey onto a seat of the white bay boat, laying her head back on the bow, where Stephanie arranged life jackets to cushion it in anticipation of a fast, bumpy ride. Vincent and Wayne supported Casey’s head as they took off, speeding west along the swollen canal toward the flooded Greens Bayou. They began twisting along Greens Bayou, taking shortcuts where they could. Vincent sat on the bow facing backward, hair whipping in the wet wind, keeping a finger on Casey’s neck to monitor her carotid pulse. It was extremely fast and irregular, an indication that Casey’s heart was malfunctioning. The skin around Casey’s lips was blue. All of these signs were ominous, and Vincent later said she thought about the possibility she would need to start CPR. She had the sense that Wayne expected it, too. At one point, Vincent’s friend Rachelle McClellan jumped out of the boat to help push them over a sand-choked levee against a current — she had to be pulled back in on the other side, where the water was deeper. To McClellan, the way Casey’s hands and feet looked reminded her of how her mother’s did the day she died. The entire journey took about 15 minutes. When they arrived, a truck was already backed up deep into the water. McClellan held onto the truck bed to keep it steady, and several men lifted Casey into it, where the gravel normally goes. Wayne and a transportation employee hopped in behind her. They planned to drive to a hospital, but found the roads were closed, and a National Guardsman they passed recommended that they drive to a small shopping center off Beltway 8, about four miles north. There was supposed to be a medical station at a Kroger grocery store, and there was also a 24-hour emergency-care center run by Memorial Hermann, the hospital system where Casey had undergone her surgery. As the truck bumped and jerked along the road, Wayne could not recall a more uncomfortable ride. The motion was beating up Casey. He struggled to keep her covered as the rain started up again. She was wet and filthy and surely cold. They arrived to find no medical clinic outside the Kroger, and the emergency medical center was closed. The two transportation employees in their orange vests cussed and looked scared. “This woman is dying,” Wayne heard one of them say into a phone or radio. “She’s going to die right here if we don’t get her an ambulance.” A lthough the dump-truck crews were deployed as part of the official storm response, their radios allowed them to communicate only among themselves. So the driver, Calvin Milburn, a maintenance technician, called 911 on his cellphone. Harris County Emergency Corps received at the call at 2:49 p.m. Milburn told the call-taker that Casey was septic and in and out of consciousness, and the call-taker helped him determine her rate of breathing, which was very rapid. She said the paramedics would do their best to get there and asked whether he had access to a defibrillator. He did not. The call center dispatched a South Lake Houston E.M.S. ambulance to the far north of its territory. “You need to bring the patient to the freeway,” the paramedic who took the call, Tyler Cegielski, said. The paramedics were not willing to exit the freeway for fear of swamping their ambulance in high water. They would have to navigate around some areas of flooding and predicted they would be at that part of the freeway in 10 or 15 minutes. The dump truck bumped back out of the parking lot and onto the freeway to await the ambulance. Wayne leaned over Casey, cradling her head in his left arm, and caressing her with his right, her body half in his lap and half in the bed of the dump truck. “Just hang in there, sweetheart. Just breathe. Just breathe,” he said. “Help is on the way. The ambulance is coming.” It was taking much longer than 15 minutes. Wayne saw several ambulances pass by, but they seemed to be going other places. The rain picked up again, and the workers let out a tarp over the truck bed to protect them. Casey had been fading in and out of consciousness for hours now. Wayne felt her stir. Her left hand rose to clench his shirt, pulling his face down to her so they were nose to nose. Her eyes were open now, looking at him. “Let me go,” she said, the first clear words he’d heard her say in more than a day. “Let me go.” “What are you talking about?” he said. “Help is right here.” But Casey did not respond. She vomited something dark and foul-smelling. She stopped breathing. Wayne reached his hand out and beat on the driver’s side window. “My wife’s dying back here,” he yelled. Milburn climbed into the truck bed with them. Casey had no pulse. He began performing CPR. Wayne saw a constable on the other side of the Beltway and leapt out of the back of the dump truck to run to her, jumping over the central median. She called for help on her radio and, seeing another constable pulling up, she told Wayne, “Get that one.” Wayne ran over and told the second constable the situation. That constable, too, got on his radio. Wayne crossed back over the median and hailed a third constable, who turned on his emergency lights, cut off traffic and pulled up behind the dump truck. Another constable arrived along with passers-by who had been driving on the freeway. One went into the back of the dump truck to help work on Casey. About three minutes after Wayne returned to the dump truck, at 3:16 p.m., the ambulance finally arrived. Two of the paramedics who had tried to save Randy Belcher the previous day, Jeremy Fuentes and Jason Foster, took over and brought Casey out of the dump truck. They figured it had been about eight minutes since her heart had stopped. They inserted a breathing tube, started an intravenous line in the crook of her right elbow and placed a needle into the tibia of her right leg to deliver fluids. They attached a pistonlike Lucas device that uses a suction cup to compress and recoil the chest, providing automated CPR. The idea that the young woman had been breathing and even speaking just a few minutes earlier made Fuentes think they had a chance to revive her. They went through everything they had on their truck that might restart Casey’s heart — multiple doses of epinephrine and atropine — but nothing seemed to work. The monitor showed a flat line, no electrical signal that they could shock back to regular rhythm. To Fuentes, the hardest part was watching Wayne watch Casey. After about 20 minutes, one of the paramedics said, “Mr. Dailey, we got to go.” Wayne rode in Ambulance No. 25 with Casey. He supplied her medical history as the ambulance, slowed by the rain, headed to Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital in Humble, more than 11 miles away, the only working hospital they knew they could reach. They arrived at 3:54 p.m. Casey’s temperature was high, but her pulse, breathing rate and blood pressure were nonexistent. Her pupils did not react to light, a sign that her brain had not received enough oxygen. For eight minutes, the hospital team pumped Casey’s chest, filled her lungs with oxygen, and gave her additional doses of epinephrine. But at 4:04 p.m., Dr. Christopher Langan concluded nothing could revive her. It was 1 day 2 hours 30 minutes after Wayne’s first call to 911. Wayne reached Casey’s parents on the phone. “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry,” he said. “Casey’s gone.” F or days after Casey died, Wayne kept receiving calls, texts and Facebook messages from people across the nation. Someone had posted Wayne’s phone number on a Hurricane Harvey Google map, and his address was one of relatively few marked with a pink dot to signify a medical emergency. “Hello, this is Wesley Brown with the Cajun Navy, I’m calling to see if you have been rescued or not.” “Wayne, this is Monica from Houston Rescue. Please let me know immediately if you are still in need of a rescue.” “Hi, this is the Cajun Navy dispatch. I’m calling to see if you’ve been rescued or need to be rescued.” “You don’t know me, but I live in Georgia. I picked up your emergency signal on the Facebook account. I’ve tried to call FEMA and all them, and I can’t get nobody on the phone, but I’ll keep trying.” Wayne responded to the messages. “I’m sorry to say that my wife passed away on the way to the hospital,” he wrote in a text message to a stranger with a South Carolina area code. “I appreciate your efforts, thank you.” “I am so so sorry for your loss,” the stranger wrote back. “Sending prayers your way.” The next week, Wayne’s and Casey’s parents noticed that she was not named as a victim of the storm. Wayne called the Harris County Medical Examiner’s office, distraught. “How come my wife is not on the list of people who died as a direct impact of Harvey?” he asked. The investigator explained that “direct impact” primarily meant drowning. Wayne’s wife, on the other hand, had a medical problem. Wayne said he knew that, “but she wouldn’t have died in the back of a dump truck on Beltway 8 after going through three boat rides if there were no floodwaters in front of my house. Because E.M.S. is 10 minutes down my street. She’d be in a hospital right now.” The investigator apologized and offered to talk to her administrator to see if she could get Casey on the list. To this day, Casey’s death is not included in Hurricane Harvey’s official toll. Randy Belcher’s is not either. In interviews, personnel at South Lake Houston E.M.S. said they believed that at least four or five other people in the district who called 911 with medical emergencies died when they were not rescued in time. Local media highlighted deaths of people in other districts as well: Noah Delgado, an 8-year-old who died of an asthma attack in northwest Harris County and whose mother could not get through to 911; Bonnie Parsutt, 69, who died in Galveston County after her oxygen failed when the electricity went out; Mary Avila, 80, also in Galveston County, who died in a nursing home when she could not get dialysis; and a heart-attack victim who died at home in a flooded neighborhood of Montgomery County that emergency workers could not reach. The City of Houston reported to the F.C.C. that many people with disabilities who had entered themselves into the State of Texas Emergency Assistance Registry and had repeatedly called 911 and 211, the city’s non-emergency line, to request help when their homes flooded did not receive assistance. The number of acutely ill people who lost their lives because of delayed rescues has not been tallied. Preliminary data from the state health department’s Center for Health Statistics indicate that 2,498 people died in Harris County in August 2017, nearly 200 more people than died in July of that year. Over the period of 2008-16, deaths in July compared with August typically varied only slightly. August 2017 appears to be an outlier. The Harris County medical examiner lists only 36 deaths as storm-related, all of which were caused directly by drowning, falls in floodwaters and electrocutions. “We consider only deaths that are a direct consequence of environmental factors,” says Tricia Rudisill Bentley, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner’s office. By contrast, the Centers for Disease Control, in guidance issued last October, recommends that medical examiners “consider indirect causes of death that can be related to the disaster,” including disruption of health care and transportation. Calculating deaths in this way is much more likely to convey the true toll of a disaster. But the C.D.C.’s recommendation “hasn’t changed anything here,” says Jason Wiersema, a forensic anthropologist with the Harris County medical examiner’s office, which has instead provided public health agencies with access to data for further analysis. T he medical examiner ultimately determined that Casey died of pulmonary emboli, blood clots that had most likely formed in her legs and then traveled to block major blood vessels in her lungs. But experts who reviewed her case believe that her deteriorating state in the days leading up to her death was probably related to how her care was managed after surgery. The tumor in one of Casey’s adrenal glands had made too much of the hormone cortisol, which typically suppresses the other gland’s release of it. After her tumor was removed, it would have taken time, perhaps months, for her body to begin producing enough again, with steroid medication needed in the interim to avert life-threatening complications. The deficit of steroid hormones would explain Casey’s pain, vomiting and weakness. The resulting dehydration and her immobility would have raised her risk for developing the blood clots — as would her recent operation and her history of Cushing’s syndrome. When they discharged Casey before the storm, doctors at Memorial Hermann did not send her home with this medicine, which is routinely given after removal of a hormone-producing adrenal-gland tumor. Memorial Hermann referred questions about the case to the individual physicians. Dr. Curtis Wray, her surgeon, declined several requests to speak through UTHealth, where he is an associate professor of surgery. The intern who discharged Casey also did not respond to several email and phone inquiries. Wayne breaking down at the funeral home during preparations for his wife’s burial with, from left, his mother, Darlene Zavertnik; his sister, Michelle Dailey Garcia; and his aunt Ruby Dailey. Andrew Burton for The New York Times Dr. Geoffrey Thompson, the head of endocrine surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said Casey’s symptoms were consistent with insufficient cortisol. “Someone forgot to give her steroids,” says the surgeon, whose group has performed close to 3,000 operations of the type Casey had. That failure, and the delay in her transport to the hospital, was all the more tragic, Dr. Thompson added, because the condition she had “is highly curable.” Dr. Laurence Katznelson, medical director of the pituitary center at Stanford School of Medicine, agrees. “Everybody gets placed on steroids,” he says. Asked whether he could come up with reasons Casey’s doctors might not have prescribed steroid medication, Dr. Katznelson replied, “I can’t think of one.” After Harvey, Sheldon Fire acquired a high-water vehicle and boat and sent firefighters for swift-water rescue training; South Lake Houston E.M.S. received approval to purchase a high-water truck for transporting people with life-threatening medical emergencies. But a major problem identified by the county was the lack of a common platform for responders to share information on local, county, state and federal levels. The information-sharing problem is a national one, recognized after the Sept. 11 attacks and the deaths of emergency workers who could not communicate with one another. The establishment of an interoperable communications system, FirstNet, for public-safety personnel was stalled by years of political wrangling over the sale of a portion of the radio spectrum, but it is finally under construction, including in Harris County. Other local and national agencies have also been experimenting: During the storm in Harris County, the Coast Guard brought in a civilian programmer to map distress signals, and in Charleston County, S.C., people can now provide information to 911 online. For Wayne Dailey, who has struggled emotionally and financially in the wake of Casey’s death, improving systems for identifying people with medical emergencies in disasters and getting help to them in time is his most fervent wish. As the climate continues to change, Harvey is far from Houston’s most extreme hurricane possibility. Parts of Harris County prone to devastation from storm surges — windswept walls of water that slam onto land with great power — were spared that additional hazard this time. “As catastrophic as Harvey was,” Francisco Sánchez, the Harris County emergency-management coordinator, says, “it had the potential to be much worse.” O n the afternoon of Sept. 14 last year, in a small, packed sanctuary in a white-painted wooden church in High Island, Tex., Casey’s funeral service began to the strains of Pearl Jam’s “Just Breathe.” The pastor read a eulogy written by Casey’s father, Chuck Dills, who was too devastated to deliver it himself (Dills died of newly diagnosed bladder cancer less than six months later). “A gift from God, that’s what she was,” Chuck wrote. The crowd left the church wiping their eyes. Wayne and Luke, two of the pallbearers, followed behind them. “Your Mom would be proud of you,” Wayne said to Luke, touching his cheek. The family drove to the graveyard. As Casey’s coffin was lowered, all was silent except for the sound of grass being mowed in the distance. One by one, each guest departed, until only Ronnie remained, peering into the broken ground. Wayne came to get him, but for a long time the boy refused to leave.","Houston thought it was prepared for a major hurricane like Harvey.

"Arizona Republic, Lorraine Longhi, Arizona Republic","Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old pro-Trump Twitter personality, misled Arizona investors from 2015-2016 in an attempt to defraud them, according to a cease and desist order filed by the Arizona Corporation Commission last year. (Photo: Via Twitter) Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old pro-Trump Twitter personality whose recent efforts to smear Special Counsel Robert Mueller appear to have been exposed as a hoax, was accused by Arizona authorities of defrauding investors in 2015 and 2016. A 2017 Arizona Corporation Commission cease-and-desist order leveled the allegations against Wohl, finding he violated securities law by misleading investors about how much of their money would be at risk, and misrepresenting his company's size. The commission ordered him to pay $32,919 in restitution and penalties totaling $5,000. Wohl's attorney told the commission in 2017 that he was unable to make the first payment and asked for a four-week continuance. ""I'm wondering why we're going through this exercise, and why you think your client is going to make payment on a later date if he's not able to make payment today,"" Commissioner Boyd Dunn said. ""This is a relatively small amount,"" Wohl's attorney said. ""I know you guys have seen hundreds of thousands of dollars for these types of cases."" Dunn replied, ""It's not a small amount to the investor. So don't belittle it."" The commission voted to give Wohl a four-week continuance, with the remaining balance to be paid in monthly installments of $1,371.61 beginning Dec. 1, 2017. Wohl has not paid any of the money he owes the commission, according to a commission spokeswoman. The commission has referred the matter to the Attorney Generals Office collections unit. Wohl neither admitted to nor disputed the findings in the consent order. He also cannot make public statements denying any finding of the decision, according to the consent order. Neither Wohl nor his attorney immediately responded to a request for comment. Was Jacob Wohl trying to discredit the special counsel? Wohl became the focus of a social media firestorm this week when the liberal-leaning political website Hill Reporter accused him of being behind false claims of sexual assault against Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. NBC News reported that multiple reporters had been contacted by a woman who said she had been offered money to say Mueller had harassed her. Wohl denied involvement in any scheme to pay women to make false allegations against Mueller. NBC, however, discovered Wohl's email in the internet-domain records for a private company that was investigating the accusations against Mueller, Surefire Intelligence. Also, phone calls to a number listed on the Surefire Intelligence website went to a voicemail belonging to Wohl's mother, NBC reported.

He has been the subject of a viral Twitter meme mocking Wohl's repeated claims of visiting ""hipster coffee shops"" around Los Angeles and overhearing conversations in which anonymous customers are discussing their support of Trump or opposition to his enemies.

The Arizona residents invested in his hedge fund, according to the Corporation Commission. Wohl's investment company, Wohl Capital Investment Group LLC, traded with the investors' money in exchange for management fees. The commission found Wohl won the business of at least one of his investors by misrepresenting his company's size. The investor was also told that only 20 percent of invested capital would be at risk. However, in January 2016, Wohl ceased operations and returned approximately 60 percent of the investors' capital, the commission said. In 2015, Wohl began looking for investors for a new hedge fund, NeX Capital Management LLC. Wohl solicited investments in the fund from two Arizonans by misrepresenting the risk involved, the commission found. While the Arizona investors entered written agreements with NeX, both terminated the investment process before NeX engaged in trading on their behalf. Wohl also began posting advertisements on Craigslist Phoenix in 2016, looking for investors in a house-flipping business. The commission documents say the Craigslist advertisements misrepresented the size of Wohl's company, Montgomery Assets Inc., and the experience of its employees and risk associated with the investment. No Arizona residents invested in Montgomery Assets. In June, Wohl tweeted calling the Arizona Corporation Commission a ""racketeering organization full of Angry Democrats,"" citing an article detailing allegations that Corporation Commission head Gary Pierce, who is a Republican, was accepting money in exchange for favorable votes affecting a utilities company. When Pierce was tried on those allegations, jurors deadlocked and the judge declared a mistrial.

"Arizona Republic, Russ Wiles, Arizona Republic","By now, most Americans are pretty hip to the importance of saving for retirement. Buzz60's Natasha Abellard has the story. Buzz60 Don’t believe everything you hear. Falsehoods — and even following fact-checked 401(k) rules of thumb in every situation — can steer savers off course. Here are five 401(k) rules worth further scrutiny. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Individual Retirement Accounts have been attracting record amounts of assets, even though relatively few people actually contribute money to them. An oxymoron? Not really. The growth of IRAs results from their widespread use as tax-sheltered repositories for funds that have been building up in 401(k)-style plans. When leaving a job, workers and retirees must decide what to do with their 401(k) assets. Moving them to an IRA often is the best choice. ""Making these types of decisions sometimes comes at an unexpected time due to a layoff, career change, personal emergency or an unexpected retirement,"" said Alan Norris, a certified financial planner at Norris Wealth Management in Phoenix. The decision is complicated by differing investment options, variances in expenses, tax traps and more. ""Knowing your options ahead of time can save you time, money and a lot of stress,"" he said. Only about 1 in 8 households contributes money to an IRA, yet IRAs held $8.4 trillion as of a 2017 tally by the Investment Company Institute. ""Rollovers from employer-sponsored retirement plans have fueled the growth in IRAs,"" said the institute, the national mutual-fund trade organization. Here are some of the issues involved. Where to put it People with money in a 401(k) account or similar plan usually have three or four options when leaving their employer. If allowed, they might be able to keep the account intact with that company. They also might be able to transfer it into a 401(k) plan at the company where they're heading, assuming the person is taking a new job and that business or entity has a retirement program. A third option is to cash out the money, and a fourth is to shift the assets to a rollover IRA established at a bank, brokerage, mutual fund company or other financial institution – companies also known as IRA custodians or trustees. It's an perennial question in personal finance when it comes to retirement planning: should youcontribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA? Newslook Taxes influence the decision Cashing out usually is the worst choice, as the tax bite could be severe. Unless you kept your assets in a Roth 401(k), ordinary income taxes would apply on the amount withdrawn. (Taxes might apply if you've held the account fewer than five years.) You also could face a 10 percent penalty if you're under age 59½, and the distribution could be subject to 20 percent federal withholding. Plus, a permanent withdrawal would remove a big chunk of your retirement assets. ""Cashouts really work against a retirement savings discipline,"" Norris said. You can avoid these tax obstacles if you keep the money at your old employer or transfer it to the new one but, as noted, not all entities allow these options. Moving to an IRA is the fallback choice. More: Keys to better investing may be hiding in your tax return More: Low-cost investments are good choices that many don't always make More: Medical costs in retirement are projected to be average of $200K. Are you prepared? More on rollovers There are a couple of ways to establish a rollover IRA. You can do so by taking possession of the cash yourself, then reinvest it with a new financial custodian. Or you can have the money sent from your old employer to the custodian. Both are designed as tax-free moves, but there are some differences. With the former, you take the distribution, then reinvest the money into a new IRA at the financial firm of your choice within 60 days, meaning that this can become a short-term loan if needed. Failing to complete the process in time can trigger ordinary taxes and possibly that 10 percent penalty. Regardless, 20 percent withholding applies. With a transfer, the money is sent directly from your old employer to the financial institution, without your touching it. Tax pitfalls are avoided. ""The method that causes the fewest headaches is a trustee-to-trustee transfer,"" Norris said. With a rollover, by contrast, ""waiting for a check to arrive by mail on an unknown date, attaching the correct transmittal paperwork, forwarding it to the correct address within 60 days and then tracking the delivery can create unnecessary anxiety,"" he said. The nine-year stretch of rising stock prices won’t last forever. So now’s a good time for investors to bear-proof their 401(k)s before the next financial storm. USA TODAY Investment options and fees One advantage of moving the money into an IRA is that you would have wider choices in terms of investments. ""In an IRA, you can choose low-cost index funds; you also can choose options like CDs or individual bonds,"" said Dana Anspach, a certified financial planner at Sensible Money in Scottsdale, Arizona. ""In an employer plan, you are limited to the choices they have preselected for you."" Also, fund expenses and other investor-borne costs could be considerably lower in a rollover IRA compared to a 401(k) plan, especially smaller and less-efficient plans. Some small 401(k) programs might have reasonable costs in the range of 0.7 percent to 1.5 percent or so annually, but other plans charge much more, Norris cautioned. In general, index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which are widely available for IRAs, are among the least-costly choices. Fidelity Investments, for example, recently unveiled two new Zero mutual funds with no ongoing expenses at all. Desire to simplify Another factor affecting whether and where to move an account involves your own financial clutter and oversight abilities. In a survey, the Investment Company Institute found that people selecting a rollover did so for several reasons. Preserving the tax-deferred status of their assets obviously was important, but so, too, were desires to consolidate assets and not leave assets with a former employer. ""When you have accounts in numerous places, it becomes more cumbersome to accomplish basic tasks like rebalancing your portfolio, updating your address or changing your beneficiaries,"" Anspach said. It's even possible to lose track of a 401(k) account left with a former employer, especially if the dollar amount is fairly small, Norris said. Security considerations If you choose the IRA route, it's wise to lean toward a large, well-established financial company that offers competitive fees and wide investment choices. Anspach cites Fidelity, Charles Schwab, Vanguard and TD Ameritrade as examples. ""Big firms like these have safeguards in place to help protect your accounts from fraud,"" she said. ""They also invest (heavily) in technology so you'll be able to easily manage your accounts online."" While Anspach usually recommends IRA rollovers over leaving the money with your old employer, one exception involves people with serious debt problems or facing lawsuits. While both IRAs and 401(k)s offer considerable creditor protection should you file for bankruptcy, IRA protections for nonbankruptcy legal issues vary by state, she said. In many states, including Arizona, IRAs enjoy strong protection, but it might be limited elsewhere. If you are facing potential legal threats, ""Check your state laws to see how much protection your funds would have if they are rolled to an IRA,"" Anspach suggests.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Mario Aguilar to Gizmodo","California gets most of its rain during the winter, but this wet season has proven especially juicy so far. The moisture parade continued on Wednesday with a major atmospheric river descended on the Golden State, raising concerns of flooding and mudslides as it dumps heavy rain and snow across a wide region through Thursday evening.
Atmospheric rivers are exactly what they sound like: long, narrow, sky-high bands of moisture originating in the tropical Pacific that speed across the ocean toward the U.S. West Coast, unleashing rain at lower elevations and snow at higher elevations. According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, big atmospheric river events can carry roughly the same amount of water as the mouth of the Mississippi.
Just a few of these events can deliver half of the West Coasts annual rainfall, making them an important source of replenishment for ever-precarious water supplies. But when theyre as intense as the moisture plume that began to arrive this morning, they can also cause flooding, which parts of the the Bay Area are already starting to experience. As warm, moist air sweeps over snow-covered mountains further inland, its likely to melt snow thats been building up at mid-elevations, triggering even worse flooding for communities in the foothills.
At the highest elevations in the Sierra Nevada, the remaining moisture will be squeezed out as snow that the National Weather Service says could total up to a whopping seven feet in some places.
Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLAs Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, said the rain Californias poised to receive could really decimate the middle elevation snowpack thats been building in the inland mountains between about 3,000 and 5,000 feet of elevation. Tonight, the big flood risk looks like itll come in those regions, Swain told Earther.
Further south, Los Angeles is starting to pick up some light rain, with a lot more expected on Thursday. The National Weather Service Los Angeles is calling for 1-2.5 inches of rain along the coastline with 2.5-4 inches of rain and even higher totals locally across the foothills and mountains through Thursday night. That raises the risk of roadway flooding as water hits soils that have already received more than their average dose of wet season rainfall. And floods arent the only worry: as all this water hits barren landscapes recently torched by wildfires, it could destabilize the soil, triggering rock and mudslides similar to those seen near Santa Barbara last year.
You might be wondering if all this wild weather is in any way connected to Seattles recent run of epic snowfall. The short answer is, kind of! Swain explained that the same atmospheric setup thats caused volley after volley of precipitation to fall as snow over the Emerald Citynamely, a parade of storms marching down the West Coast and encountering Arctic air over Western Canada, possibly a remnant of the recent polar vortex disruptionhas also brought a substantial amount of powder further south into California.
Thats part of the reason snowpack levels are high right now and flooding from the incoming tropical moisture could get hairy. Swain also emphasized that the merging of the subtropical jet stream bearing this weeks atmospheric river with the cold air already in place will create a big complex storm system that could be difficult to predict.
As a final note, this weeks rain event will be the first atmospheric river scientists can classify according to a brand-new scale. Developed by researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and detailed last week in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, the scale takes into account the amount of time an atmospheric river lingers over an area and the amount of water vapor contained within it to give the event a 1-5 intensity ranking. In a sense, its not unlike the Saffir-Simpson scale used to rank hurricanes.
Swain reckons this weeks rainfall event is a pretty solid four out of five.
Thats where the impacts are expected to be high enough theres mostly hazardous rather than beneficial, he said.","California gets most of its rain during the winter, but this wet season has proven especially juicy so far. The moisture parade continued on Wednesday with a major atmospheric river descended on the Golden State, raising concerns of flooding and mudslides as …",2019-02-13T22:19:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}","A Giant Atmospheric River Is About to Dump Loads of Rain on California's Snowpack, Threatening Floods",https://earther.gizmodo.com/a-giant-atmospheric-river-is-about-to-dump-loads-of-rai-1832599837,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--k4DNFLCg--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/r4fcgfjrzer5loi3lhei.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,storm complex,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","In the world of weather forecasting, the battle for supremacy is generally being waged between the Euro and American weather models maintained by U.S. and European Union governmental agencies.But there are tons of other options to choose from, and a new one emerged on Tuesday at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
IBM and its subsidiary The Weather Company (TWC) have created a model that aims to offer a wildly detailed view of weather around the world. If proven accurate, the model could change forecasting, particularly in the developing world where a paucity of data makes good predictions hard. But it could also invite controversy by relying on cell phone data from the Weather Channel app, which the city of Los Angeles recently sued over for misleading users about how much data it collects. 
More than a couple weather apps have recently come under fire for their handling of user data,
Read more Read
The new model, dubbed the Global High-Resolution Atmospheric Forecasting System (or the oddly-acronymed GRAF), has a couple of things going for it, but the most impressive is its resolution. The model builds off of MPAS model framework that was created by the federally-funded National Center for Atmospheric Research. Using that framework and powerful supercomputers (more on that in a sec), GRAF spits out forecasts at 3-kilometer resolution in places like the U.S. with a plethora of data. In the developing world where data is less available, that resolution scales to 15 kilometers. GRAF also updates every hour.
 In comparison, the European model offers a flat 9-kilometer resolution while the American model runs at 13 kilometers. These models are only updated a few times a day.
One of the goals of... running at higher resolution is to bring standards for weather forecasting [in the developing world] up to other standards in the rest of the world, Todd Hutchinson, a computational meteorological analysis and prediction lead for TWC/IBM, told Earther.
The super-high resolution allows the model to resolve intimate details in the atmosphere, showing not just a big storm coming but singular thunderstorm cells embedded in it. Having that type of information could be useful for a host of people from emergency managers preparing for a tornado outbreak to air traffic controllers worried about turbulence. 
But higher resolution doesnt immediately guarantee a better forecast. The model has to, you know, actually get the weather right. Hutchinson said GRAF has run relatively smoothly on the whole, but that there are still challenges in forecasting storms where the model segues from 3-kilometer to 15-kilometer resolution. That happens gradually, and the shifting algorithms from one area to the next are complex conga line that will hopefully go smoother as Hutchinson and his team gather more model runs to compare to the actual weather happening in the real world. 
None of this would be possible without massive computing power. The system runs on a supercomputer setup similar to Department of Energys Summit and Sierra supercomputers, which are among the beefiest in the world (although its not necessarily as fast). To process all the data, the system has 3.5 petabytes of elastic storage, equivalent to roughly 55,000 64-gigabyte iPhones.
The reason all this computational power is needed is that in addition to traditional forms of weather data from balloons and weather station observations around the world, GRAF also draws on atmospheric data collected by planes and ground pressure data from millions of cell phones that have the Weather Channel app. 
Most smartphones have a barometer inside, which is used to help your phones fitness tracker figure out how many stairs you climbed. Its been a holy grail for meteorologists for years, because pressure provides clues about storms. But while accessing a network of tiny pressure sensors opens up a world of forecast improvements, it also raises privacy concerns, especially in this instance. Just last week, the Weather Channel app came under fire for allegedly deceiving users and collecting a ton of their data for TWC to profit off of. 
At CES, IBM said users can opt-in to provide this new type of data collection once the model gets ramped up later in 2019. But its yet another reminder of the tradeoffs users increasingly face as they weigh privacy versus whether they should grab that umbrella before running out the door.","In the world of weather forecasting, the battle for supremacy is generally being waged between the Euro and American weather models maintained by U.S. and European Union governmental agencies.

"USA TODAY, Ledyard King, USA TODAY","This time-lapsed video shows a NOAA airplane passing through Hurricane Florence near Bermuda. USA TODAY Brock Long, administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Photo: Deborah Barfield Berry/USA TODAY) WASHINGTON – A month after Brock Long was confirmed as FEMA's newest administrator, he told a group of governors last summer that he worried the nation suffered from ""hazard amnesia."" ""We've had some bad disasters,"" he told them. ""We've had Sandy (in 2012). We've had Matthew (in 2016). We've had flooding. ""But one of the things that keeps me up at night is this nation has not seen the devastation of a major landfall hurricane since 2005. So sometimes I think we forget the worst."" That was only a few weeks before Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria struck in succession, breaking the relative calm with a triple wallop that caused thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in losses. Now the North Carolina native is quarterbacking recovery efforts for the latest monster storm, a sprawling behemoth named Florence that's heading straight for his home state. The Category 4 hurricane, which is expected to make landfall late Thursday, is packing maximum sustained winds of almost 130 mph and threatening historic flooding. More than 1 million people have begun evacuating. ""Hurricane Florence is going to be a devastating storm to the Carolina Coast, Virginia and some of the Mid-Atlantic states due to damaging winds, storm surge and inland rainfall,"" Long said in a video tweeted Tuesday. ""Bottom line is, now's the time to be prepared."" Long is gearing up for what's expected to be a prolonged and difficult recovery over the coming weeks – and not only from Florence. Two more hurricanes, Isaac and Helene, have formed in the Atlantic, and the National Hurricane Center has identified tropical disturbances in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. FEMA, meanwhile, is trying to salvage its reputation after criticism that it was unprepared to respond to the devastation of Maria. That hurricane last September killed nearly 3,000 in Puerto Rico and caused $91 billion in losses. In a report issued in July, FEMA acknowledged staffing shortages and logistical challenges in responding to Puerto Rico, where aging infrastructure, damage to communication networks and the island terrain complicated relief efforts. Hurricane #Florence is forecast to cause life-threatening storm surge, inland flooding, and damaging winds along the Carolinas and Virginia. It's extremely important for everyone in the storm's path to heed warnings and listen to local officials. pic.twitter.com/kAAAX1kTDQ — FEMA (@fema) September 10, 2018 But Long also said the agency was facing an unprecedented workload, juggling responses to three catastrophic hurricanes, historic wildfires in California and dozens of other disasters. He said the agency has learned from last year and will be better prepared to confront disasters this year. ""It is always a question of when, not if, we will be called on again,"" Long wrote in a column last month for USA TODAY. ""FEMA began incorporating lessons in real time as they were identified and continues to do so to prepare for the 2018 hurricane season. We have substantially increased stockpiles of resources across the nation, focusing on remote, hard-to-reach locations."" Craig Fugate, the widely respected FEMA chief under President Barack Obama, said the criticism leveled against the agency after Maria was unfair. Fugate, who arrived at FEMA in 2009, helped restore the agency's reputation after Hurricane Katrina. Puerto Rico's power grid was in bad shape before Maria, he told USA TODAY. The logistics were challenging. And FEMA was responding to its third major hurricane within a month. ""They're going to be judged by things that sometimes are not even in their control,"" Fugate said. ""But this is not an agency in disarray. This is not an agency that needs to be fixed.

(AP Photo/Mic Smith) ORG XMIT: SCMS101 (Photo: Mic Smith, AP) ""This is an agency of hard-core, dedicated folks doing the best they can. And even when you're doing that, by the time you're on your third catastrophic event, you start running out of stuff, and it's going to impact response."" Long and Fugate got to know each other in the 2000s, when Long was a regional hurricane program manager at FEMA and Fugate was director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Long later directed Alabama’s Emergency Management Agency before joining Illinois-based Hagerty Consulting. He assisted governments and companies on projects ranging from complex attack exercises to evacuation scenarios for large urban areas. Those who have worked with Long say he won't treat Florence any differently simply because it has his beloved home state in its cross hairs. But it should make coordination easier, because North Carolina Emergency Management Director Mike Sprayberry and many of the local officials already know him. More: As Hurricane Florence intensifies, FEMA gears up for disaster response More: Marines retreat from famed Parris Island recruiting base as Hurricane Florence advances More: Hurricane Florence is days away, but Americans already trying to help Matt Hochstein is vice president of client services at Hagerty Consulting. ""All emergencies are local, and all responses are managed at the local level, so that will really enable what those emergency managers need as this event unfolds,"" he said. ""They'll already have that working relationship with Brock."" Fugate said he expects it will be easier to deal with a disaster on the mainland than one on an island where transportation and communication systems were demolished. Fugate's advice to the current FEMA administrator? Tune out the critics. ""Brock cannot go back change what happened in Maria,"" he said. ""The agency's got to focus on the disaster in front of them. ""We constantly learn and improve and get better and then get challenged in ways that we never expected. And if we fall down, we have to get up and go again.""

Jennifer M. Wood,"With both Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War Hulk-smashing box office records, the ability to draw large numbers of moviegoers into real, live cinemas might be the greatest super power today’s comic book heroes have in Hollywood—and they’re just getting started. Before the year is up, Deadpool and Ant-Man will both have sequels, Tom Hardy will get villainous in Venom, and Jason Momoa will get his Aquaman standalone. Fortunately, you won’t have to wait that long to plan your own comic book movie marathon. From The Crow to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, here are 11 of the best comic book movies you can currently find streaming on Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) Given the immense popularity of 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and the characters’ now exalted place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it’s easy to forget no one was really banking on this team of superhero misfits to storm the box office the way they did. Though Marvel had been teasing the idea as far back as 2009, it wasn’t until James Gunn was brought aboard in 2012 that Marvel’s powers-that-be—plus Joss Whedon, who was a consultant on the film—realized they had finally found the perfect match between moviemaker and material. That synergy continued with the film’s 2017 sequel, which offered more of the same type of space shenanigans, but dove deeper into the Guardians’ back stories, including the introduction of Ego (Kurt Russell), Peter Quill’s biological (and slightly unhinged) dad. Not to mention: Baby Groot. Where to stream it: Netflix Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008) Oscar winner Guillermo del Toro used his talent for terror—and passion for Mike Mignola’s Hellboy character—to create a comic book movie that ably mixes horror, action, comedy, and the paranormal into one visually stunning feature with 2004’s Hellboy. He took that fervor one step further for its sequel, which finds Hellboy and his colleagues at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense working to save humankind from Nuada Silverlance, an evil warrior elf who—in a fit of power-hungry madness—breaks an ancient pact to maintain harmony between humankind and their mystical counterparts. (Isn’t that the way it always goes?) As with the original film, it’s clear that Ron Perlman’s having a lot of fun playing the bright red demon, which makes it even more disappointing that a planned third outing was officially declared dead by del Toro in early 2017. Where to stream it: Netflix The Crow (1994) Though a reboot of The Crow starring Jason Momoa is set to arrive in theaters in 2019, no redux will be able to temper the morbid fascination that still surrounds the original film. In 1993, rising star Brandon Lee (son of Bruce Lee) was mortally wounded while filming a scene for the movie. One year later, audiences clamored to witness Lee’s on-screen resurrection—an experience that was made even more surreal by the fact that Eric Draven, his character in the film, is resurrected after being shot, stabbed, and thrown out of a window while attempting to fight off a gang of miscreants who were attacking his fiancée. But put all that real-life tragedy aside and The Crow remains a stellar vigilante story, with Alex Proyas’ dark and moody style proving a perfect fit for James O’Barr’s gritty comic book series. Where to stream it: Amazon, Hulu Sin City (2005) It’s probably the most faithful comic-to-film adaptation of all time—and it should be, as indie pioneer Robert Rodriguez enlisted Sin City creator Frank Miller as his co-director (with a little help from Quentin Tarantino for one scene). Rodriguez’s commitment to getting it right didn’t matter to the Directors Guild of America, which refused to sign off on Miller getting a directorial credit … so Rodriguez quit the DGA. The movie, which interweaves several plot lines—a thug attempting to figure out who murdered a beautiful prostitute, a cop with a heart condition trying to protect a stripper from becoming another victim—is all the better for it. The innovative film noir plays like a comic book panel come to life, with a one-of-a-kind style that literally changed the look of comic book movies. The technique is aided by a stellar cast that includes Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Jessica Alba. Come for the style, stay for the story. Where to stream it: Netflix Doctor Strange (2016) If there is such a thing as “prestige comic book movies,” Doctor Strange would be at the top of the list—not only for an amazing cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role plus Rachel McAdams, Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, and Michael Stuhlbarg, but also because it manages to fit perfectly within the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet float somewhere just outside of it simultaneously. Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) is an impeccable-but-cocky neurosurgeon who has never met a medical challenge he doesn’t think he can conquer. But when a car accident leaves him with permanent damage to his hand that will make it impossible for him to operate, he goes searching for an experimental procedure to help regain control over his livelihood. Wanting to run before he can crawl, Dr. Strange teaches himself how to bend time and opens a Pandora’s Box of problems for his superhero cohorts, and his flesh-and-blood friends, leaving him to use his newfound powers to manipulate time to save the world (at least until the sequel arrives… if it ever arrives ). Where to stream it: Netflix Watchmen (2009) Though it was largely panned when it was released in theaters, the negative campaign against the big-screen version of Watchmen began months before it was screened due to outcry from fans of the Alan Moore comic book series on which it is based. Moore, who is also the creative brain behind V for Vendetta and From Hell, has long made it known that his goal in creating groundbreaking works like Watchmen —which used a nine-panel grid layout and a nonlinear narrative that skipped through space and time to tell its story—was to illustrate the power of the comic book medium. Though director Zack Snyder remained faithful in his adaptation of Moore’s complex work, newcomers to the story ended up slightly confused, and many hardcore fans chose to ignore it altogether. But opinions on the film, which is smartly written, well acted, and impressively directed, have thankfully softened over time, with many moviegoers giving it a second chance, and discovering a whip-smart, visually stunning entry into the comic book genre. Where to stream it: Amazon (a with Cinemax subscription) Akira (1988) For many American moviegoers, Katsuhiro Ôtomo’s Akira was their introduction into the world of anime—and what a wild initiation it was. Based on Ôtomo’s own manga series, the film starts with a nuclear explosion that sets off World War III, and then fast-forwards 30 years into the future. In 2019, Tokyo (now known as Neo-Tokyo) has become a crime-ridden dystopia where gang violence, organ harvesting, terrorism, and the abuse of military power are everyday occurrences. But when teenage pals Kaneda and Tetsuo happen upon a secret government project, they might just be the city’s best bet for a brighter future. Where to stream it: Hulu V for Vendetta (2005) James McTeigue did the Wachowkis, his longtime mentors plus the writers and producers on this project, proud when he managed to successfully translate Alan Moore’s moody style to the big screen with V for Vendetta. Hugo Weaving plays V, an anarchist in a Guy Fawkes mask who is attempting to overthrow England’s new fascist-like regime with the help of Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman whose commitment to the cause eventually overpowers her personal feelings of right versus wrong. Though Moore and his fans aren’t often enthusiastic about adaptations of his work, V for Vendetta struck a powerful enough chord with real-life freedom fighters that V’s mask has become an easily recognized symbol of protest. Where to stream it: Netflix Captain America: Civil War (2016) Like Hellboy, the Captain America franchise’s tendency to politicize its entries is one of the things that helps it stand out from its fellow comic book adaptations. Its most recent installment sees Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) facing off over the role—if any—government should play in determining which causes superheroes should defend. The disagreement becomes so heated the rest of the Avengers feel forced to pick sides … and nothing good ever comes from dividing a team of people who kick ass for a living. Where to stream it: Netflix Ghost World (2001) Before she was an Avenger, Scarlett Johansson played second fiddle to Thora Birch in Ghost World, Terry Zwigoff’s offbeat movie about two social outcasts who, upon graduating from high school, begin making plans to rent an apartment together. But as the summer unfolds, the longtime best friends find their lives heading in two different directions as Rebecca (Johansson) leans more into the mainstream after getting a job at a coffee shop and Enid (Birch) befriends a lonely restaurant manager (Steve Buscemi) who she initially tried to prank by responding to his lonely hearts ad. Birch and Johansson’s practiced deadpan plays in stark contrast to Buscemi’s self-deprecating-but-still-hopeful take on the world, but together they tell a masterful story about alienation and self-loathing that is as painfully funny as it is heartbreaking. Where to stream it: Amazon (with a Starz subscription) The Dark Knight (2008) With all due respect to Christian Bale—who looks great in a Batsuit, but sounds oddly like one of Austin Powers’ enemies as he growls his way around Gotham City—the success of Christopher Nolan’s reboot of the Batman franchise has always seemed to rest with its villains. Nowhere is this point more clearly made than in The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger, who died six months before the film’s release, posthumously won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as The Joker—and deservedly so, his performance is mesmerizing. And while Ledger plays his role with a perfect mix of insanity, intensity, and dark humor, his performance is perfectly balanced with the kind of gorgeous action scenes that have kept Nolan’s Batman movies at the top of everyone’s list.

Sven Gregori,"Pointers — you either love them, or you haven’t fully understood them yet. But before you storm off to the comment section now, pointers are indeed a polarizing subject and are both C’s biggest strength, and its major source of problems. With great power comes great responsibility. The internet and libraries are full of tutorials and books telling about pointers, and you can randomly pick pretty much any one of them and you’ll be good to go. However, while the basic principles of pointers are rather simple in theory, it can be challenging to fully wrap your head around their purpose and exploit their true potential. So if you’ve always been a little fuzzy on pointers, read on for some real-world scenarios of where and how pointers are used. The first part starts with regular pointers, their basics and common pitfalls, and some general and microcontroller specific examples. The Basics Computer RAM, where your variable data gets stored, is a bit like the cubbyholes in a kindergarten, only each box has an address instead of a nametag. When you use variables in C, the compiler associates a particular location in memory (by address) with the variable name you give it. Pointers let you get in the middle of this association — and give you access to the memory address itself, rather than what’s stored there. To make sure we’re on the same page, we start with a recap of pointer syntax, how to assign and use them, and how not to use them. // regular int variable with initial value int value = 0x1000; // int pointer variable, pointing to the location of value int *pointer = &amp;value; printf(""value: 0x%x at address %p\n"", value, &amp;value); printf(""pointer: %p at address %p\n"", pointer, &amp;pointer); printf(""*pointer: 0x%x at address %p\n"", *pointer, pointer); For simplicity, we’ll assume some made-up addresses, and our first example will give us the following output: value: 0x1000 at address 0x2468 pointer: 0x2468 at address 0x246c *pointer: 0x1000 at address 0x2468 &amp; gets the address of the variable that it’s prepended to, and * “dereferences” a pointer — you can think of it requesting the value at the address that the pointer points to. We can see that value resides at address 0x2468 and pointer at address 0x246c, with pointer ‘s content being the address of value. That’s the whirlwind tour. Storing numbers in memory isn’t very useful without knowing what type of number they are — how many bytes long the number is, whether it’s signed, and so on. Based on the values alone, we couldn’t tell which one would represent a memory address, an integer, or any other data, they are all just numbers and it depends how we use and reference them. This is why pointers themselves have their own types — the type of a pointer to the type data that is stored at the address. This is especially the case for pointer as a regular variable, and *pointer as a reference to another memory location. The difference becomes even more evident when we assign new values to either one of them. // simple variable assignment value = 0x2000; // regular pointer dereference and assignment, same result as the statement before *pointer = 0x2000; // assigning to the pointer itself without dereferencing // technically okay, but compiler warns about assigning a regular integer to a pointer variable pointer = 0x2000; // explicit cast keeps the compiler happy, but.. pointer = (int *) 0x2000; //..dereferencing is where things get tricky now *pointer = 0x2000; On a system with a memory management unit, such as your average desktop computer, you will most certainly end up with a segmentation fault in the last line. What happened? In the third line, we wrote a new address ( 0x2000 ) into the pointer. The compiler complained because we wrote an integer into a variable that should be a pointer to an integer, and we should have listened. Instead, we just got rid of the error warning by explicitly telling the compiler to store 0x2000 as a pointer to an integer in the fourth line. When we tried to write a value into the address associated with this pointer, it was out of bounds. Who knows what lives in memory location 0x2000 ? On a big computer, the MMU prevents you from writing to addresses outside your program’s territory, which could otherwise have fatal consequences. Naturally, this gets a lot more interesting on systems without such protection, like the vast majority of 8-bit microcontrollers. Assigning a hard-coded memory address to a pointer will be perfectly fine in that case, as long as you know what you are doing. On the other hand, if you have programmed for a microcontroller before, you have most likely used hard-coded pointer locations already without even noticing. Microcontroller Registers Let’s have a look at this simple piece of code that could be used to turn on a LED attached to an AVR ATmega328: // file led.c #include &lt;avr/io.h&gt; DDRB = (1 &lt;&lt; DDB1); // set up PB1 as output PORTB = (1 &lt;&lt; PB1); // set output on PB1 high DDRB and PORTB are two of the ATmega’s GPIO registers and defined as preprocessor macro by avr-gcc. If we take a look at the preprocessor output, we can see what’s behind those two macros: $ avr-gcc -E -mmcu=atmega328 led.c... (*(volatile uint8_t *)((0x04) + 0x20)) = (1 &lt;&lt; 1); (*(volatile uint8_t *)((0x05) + 0x20)) = (1 &lt;&lt; 1); $ Yes, your microcontroller registers are in fact pointers to a hard-coded memory address. If you take a look at the Register summary section in the ATmega’s data sheet, you will find those two registers are mapped indeed to addresses 0x24 and 0x25 respectively. And being pointers, we can pretty much treat them like any other pointer. Passing Registers to Functions To a pointer, it doesn’t matter what kind of memory it is pointing to. Whether it references a local variable on the stack, or a register mapped into RAM, in the end, it’s all just data behind an address. And by that logic, if we can do something like some_function(&amp;regular_variable) in C, i.e. pass a pointer as parameter to a function, we should be able to do the same with registers. We all love LEDs, and toggling LEDs is always a good example, but let’s assume that we cannot commit to one specific I/O pin that should control our LED, and we rather keep our options open to easily change that later on, maybe even during runtime. // a simple struct that stores a GPIO port and pin number struct gpio { volatile uint8_t *port; uint8_t pin; }; // a variable for our LED GPIO pin struct gpio led; // assign the given port and pin to our led struct void led_setup(volatile uint8_t *port, uint8_t pin) { led.port = port; led.pin = pin; } // turn the LED on by setting its GPIO pin to 1 void led_on(void) { // PORTB |= (1 &lt;&lt; PB1) *led.port |= (1 &lt;&lt; led.pin); } // turn the LED off by clearing its GPIO pin void led_off(void) { // PORTB &amp;= ~(1 &lt;&lt; PB1) *led.port &amp;= ~(1 &lt;&lt; led.pin); } int main(void) { DDRB = (1 &lt;&lt; DDB1); // set PB1 as output led_setup(&amp;PORTB, PB1); // note the ampersand &amp; led_on(); } Instead of accessing the GPIO register directly, we now store a reference to that register in a global variable, and later dereference that variable, which will let us access the actual register again. By the time led_on() is executed, the function doesn’t care anymore which I/O pin the LED is actually connected to. Admittedly, this particular example won’t quite justify the added complexity, we can achieve more or less the same with preprocessor macros. However, say we wanted to control multiple LEDs connected arbitrarily, or have a generic handler for polling multiple inputs, we could now store the references in an array and loop through it. If we take another look at the preprocessor output, you may notice that there are now some redundant pointer operations going on, since &amp;PORTB is translated to &amp;(*(volatile uint8_t *)((0x05) + 0x20)), which is essentially the same as (volatile uint8_t *)((0x05) + 0x20). On the other hand, so is &amp;*&amp;*&amp;*&amp;(*(volatile uint8_t *)((0x05) + 0x20)), and they will all result in the exact same binary file. In other words, it makes no difference, but &amp;PORTB seems a lot clearer than (volatile uint8_t *) 0x25. You probably noticed the volatile keyword by now. If you want to read more about it, we dedicated a full article to it in the past. Pointers Need a Home The most important requirement to succeed with pointers and avoid segmentation faults is that they always have a large enough place inside memory that they can actually access. Again, on a system without MMU, any location in the memory is technically such a place, but it’s a lot stricter with memory protection, and we also need to avoid pointers that don’t point to anywhere specific. // uninitialized pointer variable int *pointer; // dereferencing might access any arbitrary location in memory *pointer = 123; Depending on some other factors, this may not necessarily cause a segmentation fault, but that doesn’t mean it’s without problems. To make your life easier, always ensure that a pointer has an actual location it is pointing to. However, once a pointer has a valid memory location associated to it, we can do pretty much anything we want with that space. // have one type of struct struct something foo = {... }; // make a different type of struct believe the first one is one of them struct something_else bar = *((struct something_else *) &amp;foo); This is a perfectly valid cast, and as long as accessing members of bar won’t go beyond the size of foo, we will be on the safe side. Whether such a type cast makes sense or not is of course a different story, and depends on the context, but pointers give us the freedom to cast as we please. Another way to use this freedom is assembling sequential data to one common buffer. Assembling Data with Pointers Say we need both of those struct s concatenated into a single buffer. We could use a char[] buffer and memcpy() both struct s into it, but then we use twice the memory. Instead, we can simply make that buffer believe that it’s actually two types of struct s: char buf[BIG_ENOUG_SIZE]; struct something *foo; struct something_else *bar; // point foo to the beginning of buf foo = (struct something *) buf; // point bar to the location after foo inside buf bar = (struct something_else *) (buf + sizeof(struct something)); Once again, pointers are simply memory addresses. The compiler will guide us to avoid the most obvious mistakes, but in the end, it’s up to us how we interpret what’s located at those addresses. And in case we don’t want to interpret that data at all, we can make use of C’s generic pointer type void *. The Void Pointer In some cases, we are only interested in the memory address itself, and we might just want to pass that address around, for example to a function that doesn’t care how the data itself is arranged. If we use the void pointer, we can simply assign to and from it without any explicit type cast necessary, which can help us keep the code a bit cleaner. // actual storage for the struct struct something s; // assign it to void pointer, no cast needed here void *foo = &amp;s; // assign it back to a specific pointer, no cast needed here either struct something *bar = foo; void pointers are commonly found in dynamic memory allocation functions, for example as return type for malloc() and as parameter type for free(), and any other generic memory accessing functions such as memcpy() or fwrite(). Keep in mind though, since it removes details of the data itself, dereferencing a void pointer will result in a compiler error, unless we first cast to an explicit pointer type. // regular struct member assignment s.some_member = value; // dereferencing void pointer, will result in compiler error foo-&gt;some_member = value; // cast before dereferencing void pointer, this is okay ((struct something *) foo)-&gt;some_member = value; // dereferencing explicit pointer type, no problems here bar-&gt;some_member = value; Note the arrow operator -&gt; when dereferencing a struct (or union ) to access its members. This is a shortcut C offers and is identical to (*variable).member. Beware though that (*variable).member is not the same as *variable.member. The first, enforced by the parentheses, dereferences the pointer before accessing member, while the second dereferences a pointer-type member inside the struct. This is naturally an easy source for errors, which the arrow operator helps us to prevent. To Be Continued This concludes our first part, and we merely scratched the surface of possibilities we have with pointers, which just shows how complex the seemingly simple concept of “it’s just a memory address” can really be. Next time, we continue with pointer arithmetic and some more complex pointer arrangements.","Pointers — you either love them, or you haven’t fully understood them yet.

Hilary Brueck,"If it feels like you're getting drenched every weekend, rest assured: the sky is not out to get you this summer. Ever since the industrial revolution in England, scientists have worried that we might be ruining our own weekends by creating weekday pollution that leads to more rain on Saturdays and Sundays. The idea is that as people pollute the air with exhaust from cars and factories, we send more solid, rain-fueling particles called aerosols into the atmosphere. Those tiny pieces of industrial trash become building blocks for clouds, since water can condense onto them. But when lots of aerosols are floating around in the atmosphere, they can crowd each other out and create much smaller cloud droplets, leading to less rainfall. ""They take longer to grow big enough to fall out as rain,"" Angeline Pendergrass, a project scientist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research who studies precipitation, told Business Insider. But she said any argument that this phenomenon makes weekend days rainier simply doesn't hold water. ""If there is an effect, it's really small,"" she said. Some of the most recent research-based myth-busting on this subject was done by weather expert David Schultz in 2007. After studying more than 200 weather stations across the US, Schultz and his colleagues ruled that there was no discernible pattern of particularly rainy days in a week. The processes through which aerosols form clouds are complex, and pollution is not the only thing determines when rain falls or how long clouds stay in the air. Aerosols can also build up from all sorts of natural solids like dirt and salt. Weather patterns also change based on other factors like the jet stream and whether clouds form over land or sea. MGM Pendergrass proposes a different reason why it can feel as though it's raining more on the weekends. ""I think it's more psychological than meteorological,"" she said. When we're out of the office and want to be spending our days at the beach or in the park, it can be very disappointing to see rain in the forecast. Those strong feelings can make weekend precipitation more memorable, even though there's no true increase on Saturday or Sunday. There may also be an additional reason why weekends seem extra-rainy this year in particular: portions of the US are much rainier than normal right now. It's been a wet spring across several areas of the country, especially on the East Coast and throughout the northern plains. Rainfall in areas around Washington DC has been 300% above usual in the last 30 days. Parts of Florida, Nebraska, and Montana have been equally soaked. Scientists like Pendergrass who study the global climate say people should get used to this: increased rainfall is part of a warming world. So are stronger, more damaging hurricanes. Think of it like the Earth's version of a feverish sweat. But if you want to know the best time of day to make plans based on the chances of rain, here's an evidence-based hack: stay inside in the afternoon. When the sun comes up in the morning and starts heating the surface of the Earth, warm air rises and clouds form. By afternoon, there's enough energy in the sky for a storm to form. So if it's pouring on you on a weekend afternoon, you can blame that hot ball in the sky, no matter what day it is.","The idea that it rains more on weekends because of weekday pollution is a myth. But it is true that pollution can have a small effect on rainfall in highly polluted or dense areas.

Colin Dwyer,"It was just after 7:30 p.m., on July 26, that dispatchers heard Jeremy Stoke's mayday call. The fire inspector had been in his pickup heading to evacuate a neighborhood in northwest Redding, Calif., when he was trapped by the blaze himself. Only silence answered the dispatchers' replies. They found Stoke's body the next day. Now, three weeks later, California officials have explained what happened the night Stoke died in the Carr Fire, which was then just days old. And they have identified his unsettling killer: a tornado of flame, the likes of which the state had never seen before. The behemoth that fire officials describe almost beggars the imagination — but they have video proof, from multiple angles. The footage below was shot from a helicopter. The videos were included in a report released earlier this week by California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. In the report, officials describe a ""large fire tornado"" that had formed on the strength of suddenly gusting winds. It had a base wider than three football fields end to end, according to the report, and winds that whipped as fast as 165 mph. Measured on the standard Enhanced Fujita scale, it had the strength of an EF3 tornado. According to National Weather Service data, few tornadoes in California history are known to have reached that high on the scale — and among those that did, none came close to the sheer width of what Cal Fire says ravaged Northern California. That's not to mention the heat: Inside the cyclone of fire, authorities believe temperatures surpassed 2,700 degrees F — in other words, hotter than volcanic magma. Video recorded from the dash of an emergency vehicle reveals the blinding orange phenomenon consuming the horizon. ""Regardless of the primary factors that caused the fire tornado, the resultant fire behavior was unpredictable and unusual,"" the report said. ""It surprised many highly experienced firefighters."" That includes firefighter Jeremy Stoke, 37, a longtime veteran of the fire service who reportedly cut his vacation short to volunteer for the efforts fighting the Carr Fire. ""It's not something that I have ever received training to look out for. It could've been any of us,"" Redding Fire Marshal Craig Wittner told local media. ""It was something out of this world, a perfect storm,"" Stoke's stepfather, Gary Parmely, told The Associated Press. ""It was incompatible with life, and he happened to drive into it."" Elsewhere that night, the Carr Fire claimed the life of another firefighter, a bulldozer operator who was caught in the blaze's rapid escalation. To date eight people have died in the wildfire or complications related to it, according to member station KQED. And it continues to burn. The Carr Fire has consumed more than 218,000 acres, making it the eighth-largest fire in state history — for now. With the blaze just 75 percent contained, it is likely to claim a higher position in the state's record books before long. As NPR's Camila Domonoske pointed out, four of the largest fires have occurred in the past six years, an accelerating pace that experts link with climate change. The state's largest-ever wildfire, the Mendocino Complex Fire, continues to burn in its own right. At more than 375,000 acres, the blaze has ravaged an area larger than Los Angeles — and its largest branch stands roughly 25 percent from full containment.","California authorities say the behemoth killed a firefighter battling the Carr Fire last month.

Vanessa Romo,"A fire helicopter takes off through smoke rising to make a drop on active fires in Yosemite National Park last week after the park reopened following a three-week closure. Gary Kazanjian/AP Firefighters continue to battle the largest fire in California history even as another large blaze has been contained. The Ranch Fire, one of the two wildfires that make up the Mendocino Complex, has burned through 341,047 acres — or 533 square miles — and is at 76 percent containment, Cal Fires reported on Sunday. Daron Wyatt, a public information officer, said challenging weather conditions and ""steep, inaccessible terrain,"" have made progress against the fire especially difficult, according to The Press Democrat. The newspaper reported, ""Wyatt said he has seen recent photos of some of the 3,500 firefighters assigned to the fire scrambling along hillsides with 60 percent slopes, so steep they needed to pull themselves up by their fire hoses."" By late Sunday the fire had gained another 6,000 acres. After raging for 17 days, the River Fire was contained on Aug. 13., but not before flames tore through 48,920 acres. The total acreage consumed by the twin fires is 389,967 since they first broke out on July 27, with a combined containment of 79 percent. In all, 157 homes and some 120 structures have been destroyed. Matt Burchett, a veteran firefighter and battalion chief with the Draper Fire Department in Utah, was killed in the intense fight against the fire Ranch fire on Aug. 13. The Deseret News reported his body was returned home with a ""solemn escort, without lights or sirens"" on Friday. He was accompanied by the Utah firefighters who also helped combat the fire. Despite the difficulties, officials say full containment is still expected by Sept. 1. Crews continue making progress on the devastating Carr Fire that is raging further north in the Redding area. Cal Fire reported that the Shasta County fire, set off by sparks from the rim of a flat tire scraping along Highway 299, is now 83 percent contained. So far, it has charred more than 227,098 acres and is by far the most destructive of the state's fires. It has decimated 1,079 residences, 22 commercial structures and 503 other buildings. At least seven people have been killed in the fire, started July 23, including three firefighting personnel and a great-grandmother and two children. It took firefighters a few days longer than they had hoped, but the Ferguson Fire, which shut down swaths of Yosemite National Park and scorched more than 96,000 acres, was fully contained on Saturday night. Achieving 100 percent containment means officials have stopped it from spreading but it does not mean it is completely out. As Ferguson Fire Information Officer Brendan Halle told Ryan Levi of the public radio show The California Report, ""It's not controlled."" ""Controlled would be after there are no more hot spots or smoking areas, and there are still interior pockets of unburned fuel in that containment line that are probably going to smoke for a while until they have the first really good storm or wetting rain up in this region, and that will probably lead to the whole thing being controlled,"" Halle said. The Ferguson Fire burned for more than a month — 36 days — killed two firefighters, and has had a calamitous impact on what is traditionally the peak tourist season in and round Yosemite National Park. Levi says that park closures have resulted in about $50 million in lost revenue. According to Levi, ""Park officials closed the popular Yosemite Valley to the public on July 25, and the following week, the fire burned into the park for the first time, leading the National Park Service to close a large portion of the park indefinitely on August 5. Yosemite Valley reopened on August 14. Mariposa Grove and Wawona have also reopened, while Glacier Point remains closed."" The cause of the fire remains under investigation.","Steep, rugged terrain has slowed progress on most of the fires raging throughout the state, including the Ranch Fire.

Mark Kaufman,"Weve entered some profoundly unfamiliar planetary territory. Amid a backdrop of U.S. politicians still questioning whether the changing climate is attributable to humans (it is), it's quite likely that weve actually boosted Earth's carbon dioxide a potent greenhouse gas to the highest levels theyve been in some 15 million years. The number 15 million is dramatically higher than a statistic frequently cited by geologists and climate scientists: That today's carbon levels are the highest they've been on Earth in at least 800,000 years as there's irrefutable proof trapped in the planet's ancient ice. Though scientists emphasize that air bubbles preserved in ice are the gold carbon standard, there are less direct, though still quite reliable means to gauge Earth's long-ago carbon dioxide levels. These measurements, broadly called proxies, include the chemical make-up of long-dead plankton and the evidence stored in the breathing cells, or stomata, of ancient plants. Scientists have identified this 15 million number by measuring and re-measuring proxies all over the world. Ancient air stored in ice core bubbles. Image: nasa Its a good scientific documentation, but its an indirect measure, Michael Prather, a professor of earth system science at the University of California Irvine, said in an interview. And theres several lines of evidence, Prather, a lead author on UN climate reports, added, citing the carbon dioxide evidence in fossilized marine life. Its not just one persons crazy number. Direct measures of the air show carbon dioxide levels have recently hit 410 parts per million, or ppm, the highest-recorded number in human history. For the most part, carbon dioxide was below 400 ppm for the last 14 million years or so, Matthew Lachniet, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said in an interview. SEE ALSO: This scientist keeps winning money from people who bet against climate change There may have been a time, roughly 3 million years ago during an extremely warm period called the Pliocene Epoch when sea levels were between 16 and 131 feet higher than today when carbon concentrations could have approximated present levels. However, the concentration of CO2 currently in Earths atmosphere is higher or is nearly as high as it has been over any time period during the past 15 million years, Daniel Breecker, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Texas at Austin Jackson School of Geosciences, said over email. The critical difference today, however, is that carbon emissions are expected to continue rising. With the unprecedented burning of fossil fuels, carbon accumulations will simply keep going up. Different proxies, like phytoplankton (red), give scientists a good range (blue background) of past atmospheric carbon dioxide estimates. Image: United Nations/Ipcc Of course, C02 concentrations arent stopping today, said Lachniet. Were probably going to blow through 550 to 600 ppm. Those sorts of high carbon concentrations haven't been experienced on Earth in well over 20 million years, noted Lachniet. That makes this conversation even more stark, he said. Some folks in the climate community, though, have even argued that todays climate has the highest concentration of total greenhouse gases when gases like methane (natural gas) and nitrous oxide are added to the mix in 20 million years. This idea, called the carbon dioxide equivalent has some support in the climate community, though a variety of climate scientists we reached out to werent aware of research supporting this 20 million-year claim. In the end, its not just the actual concentration of carbon dioxide that matters its how sensitive the planet ends up being to this dramatically rising carbon accumulation, noted Breecker. Already, Earth has proven quite sensitive Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 degree Celsius. Major consequences have already been regularly observed in Earths water cycle bringing greater odds of extremes in deluges and drought. The most easily-predicted results, record-breaking heat waves and historic wildfires, are manifesting globally, as well as more complex atmospheric changes. It [global warming] raises sea levels and makes storm surges worse, it makes the atmosphere wetter, leading to flooding from extreme rainfall, and warming ocean temperatures provide extra energy to tropical storms, climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, head of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in September. ""The polar ice is melting, in the ocean the Gulf Stream System is weakening, and in the atmosphere the jet stream is getting weird, Rahmstorf added. Unlike previous geologic epochs, the defining circumstance today isnt just notably high carbon in the air its how fast its all accumulating. The natural world both loads and removes carbon from the atmosphere over long periods of thousands to tens of thousands of years. For example, a warm period called the Eemian, which ended around 120,000 years ago, slowly melted a significant portion of Greenlands ice sheets even with profoundly lower carbon concentrations of around 280 ppm. But these days, the climate hasnt yet caught up. Were warming so fast that we havent even begun to let Greenland melt, noted UC Irvines Prather. Where civilization ultimately ends up, carbon-wise, is contingent upon how quickly global societies transition to clean energy, and generate electricity without a deep reliance on fossil fuels. I would argue what's really relevant is where we stabilize out, said Lachniet. Over the next hundred years we really set the next 10,000 years of climate history.","We’ve entered some profoundly unfamiliar planetary territory.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Stefan Thissen Eighty years ago the Nazis' persecution of the Jews suddenly turned violent in a night of mayhem. This and the next day are known as Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass - and there are still some who remember it vividly. ""Our father took me and my little sister in his arms that night, and said: this is the beginning of a very difficult time, and we'll try to live through it."" Ruth Winkelmann is now 90, but looks far younger than her years. Her eyes are a bright hazel as she looks up at the sky above the roof terrace of her old Jewish primary school in the heart of eastern Berlin. ""When I stand here and look up at the clouds, I think that my father is watching over me, and it's a good feeling,"" she says. Then, Ruth points across the rooftops, towards the domes of Berlin's New Synagogue, now restored and gleaming in the sunlight, remembering the smoke she saw billowing out when the Nazis set fire to it exactly 80 years ago. She was just 10 years old on 10 November 1938. The day began normally, but as her father drove her to school, they witnessed troubling scenes. ""On our way in, we saw broken shop windows and shards of glass lying in the streets. And then we saw a shop where someone had painted the word 'Jew', and smeared on a star of David."" Image copyright Getty Images They drove on, and saw a Jewish man in a black coat. Some Nazi storm troopers had grabbed him, and were daubing a star of David on to the back of his coat. And then they beat him, too. ""I thought, 'My Dad is with me and nothing bad can happen to me,' but it was a very disturbing sight, and I was shaking."" Ruth had every reason to be afraid. When she got to school, the head teacher took the girls straight into assembly. Image copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption Ruth (right) with her younger sister, Eddi ""That's where we heard what had been going on in Berlin during the night - that Jewish shops had been smashed up and people brutally killed. Shop windows had been broken everywhere, and the words 'Jew' or 'Jewish pig' written in many places. ""We were all very frightened. And on that day, for the first time since I'd started attending that school in 1934, there were prayers. It was a Jewish school, but not an Orthodox, religious one."" The little girls tried to peer out of the school windows at what was happening on the street below. ""You couldn't actually see the storm troopers from where we watched, just their flags - and they were shouting and making a terrible racket. They'd barricaded the entrance, and daubed stuff all over the school too - stars of David and 'Jew' and 'Jews out' and things like that."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A burning synagogue on Fasanenstrasse, Berlin The Nazi government had steadily been passing legislation discriminating against Jews, including children like Ruth, who was born to a Jewish father, Hermann Jacks, and a mother, Elly, a Protestant who'd converted to Judaism in order to marry him. In 1935 the Nuremberg laws had become the legal basis for the expulsion of Jews from public life in Germany. The Nazis codified exactly who was Jewish and to what degree: definitions that for many came to mean the difference between life and death. On Kristallnacht, the creeping persecution burst into overt and bloody violence. Find out more Watch Caroline Wyatt's report for the News at Ten, at 22:00 on Saturday 10 November Listen to Caroline's radio documentary for Heart and Soul on the BBC World Service - The girl who witnessed Crystal Night That day, Ruth and the other girls had to escape via the school loft, walking two by two through the attics until they found their way down some stairs and into a back courtyard behind the main street. ""Our teachers told us to go straight home because the storm troopers were still able to see us from where they were standing. We were terribly scared."" When she finally got home, Ruth realised that it was not just the children who were afraid, but her parents and grandparents too. They had also seen the smoke coming from the New Synagogue after Nazi storm troopers broke in, desecrating the Torah scrolls and setting fire to whatever they could find. It was one of several hundred Jewish places of worship attacked in Germany that night, as well as Jewish homes, schools, hospitals and more than 7,500 businesses. Close to 100 Jews were killed, and some 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and taken to concentration camps. Ruth only realised this was happening when she returned to school and discovered that several of the fathers had gone missing - arrested or deported: first the Polish Jews, and then the German Jews. Image copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption Ruth and her mother, Elly As I sit with Ruth over a cup of tea at her cosy house near the woods in northern Berlin, she shows me black and white photos of her family and the home she grew up in, on a similarly tree-lined street a little further north. Thanks to the Nuremberg laws, her father's parents were forced to sell their scrap-metal business, which left her father without a job. Then they were forced to sell their home. And later, her grandparents and Ruth's other Jewish relatives were deported. Fifteen of them died; only one survived. Her paternal grandparents starved to death in the concentration camp at Terezin, also known as Theresienstadt, in what is now the Czech Republic. The sudden violence of Kristallnacht is seared into Ruth's memory. ""In retrospect, I became a grown up on that day,"" she tells me. ""The pogrom night took away my childhood."" She shows me a water-stained copy of her Nazi-era ID card, stamped with J for Jew. Image copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption Ruth's family - her mother and younger sister (left), her father, Ruth and an aunt The complex Nazi race laws had declared children such as Ruth and her younger sister Eddi ""first degree mixed-race"", because while their father Hermann was Jewish, their mother had been born Protestant. For the Nazis she still counted as ""Aryan"", despite her conversion, because of her German blood. But because the two girls were registered as members of the Jewish community, they were deemed to be Jewish, Geltungsjuden. Later they were made to wear a yellow star on their coats and had to add the name ""Sara"" to their real names. Image copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption The name ""Sara"" was added to Ruth's name In an attempt to save the children, Ruth's parents agreed to divorce. However, this left Ruth's beloved father even more vulnerable. He was deported to Auschwitz in 1943. Ruth received four postcards from her father, sent from the death camp. She still has them. Now barely legible, they make clear that her father's final act of love to his children was to protect them from the horrors of the camp. She reads me one of them: ""My dear ones, I am well. How are you? Your parcel with bread and cake and tobacco has arrived. Thank you so much, that was very nice. Otherwise, nothing new. Best wishes to your Mum on her birthday too. Love and kisses from your Dad."" Image copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption One of the postcards Ruth's father sent from Auschwitz Ruth's father was a captive at Monowitz, a sub-camp of Auschwitz where prisoners were forced to work for the chemical industry. He was working on some scaffolding, when someone pushed him off. Ruth found out that her father was taken away unconscious, in a van equipped with deadly gas, camouflaged as an ambulance. ""Everyone thought he would never have woken up again, but he must have done,"" she says. ""Because I learnt from the Auschwitz archives much later that he wasn't killed until January 1944."" In Berlin, food for Ruth, her mother and her sister became increasingly scarce. At 14, Ruth was called up to do forced labour. All three received a summons from the Gestapo, and only narrowly escaped deportation. Ruth's mother, Elly, decided it was time to go into hiding. She selected a wooden shed on an allotment in southern Berlin, which belonged to a member of the Nazi party called Leo Lindenberg, who had taken a shine to her. ""We didn't feel safe there in the shed, but it was better than any alternative, because we could live there as non-Jews,"" remembers Ruth. ""I never wore the yellow star on my coat there, otherwise Leo Lindenberg would have been in huge trouble. We told the neighbours that our flat in Berlin had been destroyed by the bombing. That was common enough, so nobody asked too many questions."" Image copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption Ruth on holiday as a young child Life in the shed was harsh - there was no water, electricity or heating. ""When the temperature outside fell to minus 10, it was minus 10 inside too. And in the last four months we lived on nothing but red turnips and oatmeal,"" Ruth remembers. They had to grind the oatmeal from whole grains, putting them through a coffee grinder three times and then sifting it. It took half an hour to produce three spoonfuls. Just before the end of the war, Ruth's sister Eddi died of diphtheria. But Ruth and her mother survived. Later, Elly married Leo Lindenberg, who asked his step-daughter to convert to Christianity, and Ruth complied. But she still wears the star of David around her neck. ""I converted out of gratitude because Leo risked his life for us,"" Ruth explains. ""But my faith always remained mixed. I cannot say that I'm Jewish, and nor can I say that I'm Protestant. If you think about it, Judaism is the faith that Christianity sprang from, the root of it. I think that if I follow the 10 commandments, I'm not such a bad person. My father definitely wouldn't have condemned it, and his opinion was always the most important to me. My mother would have nothing against it either. More than anything else, she wanted me to live well and be happy."" Ruth says that even in the darkest times, she always kept her faith in God. Image caption Ruth at home, wearing the star of David ""That doesn't mean I go to church a lot,"" she says, ""but when I'm out in nature, I have everything I wish for and I thank him for the beautiful time I'm still having today. Not many people live to 90, and in reasonably good health too. I'm very grateful to my God."" However, she no longer wears her star of David in public, having seen a passenger on the underground rip a crescent moon necklace from the neck of a Turkish girl. She puts it on for family occasions, though, and when she is giving a talk - as she frequently does, despite her age. For Ruth, connecting with the young and telling her story to new generations remains vital. ""The most important thing for me is that they take on board how difficult it is to live in a democracy. Everyone has a different opinion, and picking out the best requires care and attention,"" she says. ""But democracy is the only way to live. Living under a dictatorship is impossible."" Ruth takes me to the house where she grew up. Set into the pavement outside is a small polished brass square, the size of a cobblestone. It's called a Stolperstein - a stumbling stone - and it bears the name of her father and the date he was killed in Auschwitz. She bends down to show me. ""To me this is a way of honouring my father. Because of course we don't have a headstone for him, there's no grave. And whenever I come past here, I pause for a moment - it's like a short visit to him. Whenever I come here, I feel as though my father is still standing there in the courtyard and polishing our bicycles, or all the family's shoes. That's what he liked to do on a Sunday morning."" Ruth has lived her life so remarkably free from bitterness. But is she alarmed by the rise of the far right in Europe, I ask. ""Of course I worry about that,"" she admits. ""But I'm hopeful that mankind learnt something from the Nazi era. I do worry about the rise of those parties, but I don't think we will ever see a systematic mass extermination like the Holocaust again. "" I meet Ruth again by the New Synagogue, just behind the school where she witnessed the events of Kristallnacht. By the entrance, beside the armed guards who are now permanently present, is a black plaque with golden lettering. It reminds passers-by that the synagogue was set alight by the Nazis during the night of 9 November 1938, and largely destroyed in a bomb attack by the Allies in 1943 before being restored. In capital letters beneath, it urges: ""Never forget.""

Ethan Gach,"Anthems most dedicated players spend almost as much time complaining about the lack of loot as they do grinding for it, so why are they now avoiding so many of the games shiny objects? Because most of them are useless junk that isnt worth dealing with.
The game limits the amount of loot players can collect while out on a Freeplay or Stronghold mission to 50 items. Once youre capped, you wont be able to pick up new stuffand you wont be able to drop any of those items youve already snagged until you go back to the Forge and see what they are. For high level players searching for only the rarest stuff, its important to keep those slots open in case that Legendary theyve been desperate to find turns out to be the 51st item. As a result, its not uncommon to see players trying to weave between piles of loot in order to only pick up the stuff thats actually worthwhile, which are indicated on the ground as orange pyramids rather than purple or blue ones.
Ive done it a couple times just on instinct because my overall inventory is almost full and breaking down new items is always a chore. On a few missions more recently, I started noticing that other people were getting really into it, and players have now started sharing some of these moments on the games subreddit.
The new loot ritual is a testament to how a games systems can interact in complex ways to produce unexpected results. While less rare gear can be broken down into the ingredients required to craft Sigils, consumables that give players special buffs for the duration of a mission, it doesnt take long to stock up on those resources. The games 250 slot vault, meanwhile, fills up quickly since players are encouraged to shift between different Javelins builds, each of which has dozens of unique Masterwork items associated with it. Players dont have the time or patience to mess around with lower-power stuff.
For that reason its not uncommon to see players lash out at piles of loot that dont have anything good in them before flying away. In another clip recently shared on the games subreddit, one player tried to do just that, but a lightning storm had other ideas.

"Jason Bergman, Harry Cheadle","A child at Bernie Sanders's rally at Brooklyn college. All photos by the author.In 2016, Bernie Sanders and his campaign made an indelible mark on the Democratic Party. Even though his run ended in a flameout at the Democratic National Convention, his ideals and campaign tactics have influenced a wave of newer and younger politicians who are now somewhat ironically competing with him for the chance to challenge Donald Trump in 2020. But despite the more crowded field, Sanders clearly has a strong base of supporthe scored over $6 million in individual donations in the first 24 hours of his official campaign, more than any other candidates initial haul.
On Saturday, Sanders held his first campaign rally in southern Brooklyn, where he grew up, to make his case for a second go-round. Despite an overnight snowstorm and a muddy field filled with slush, thousands of people rallied at the quad of Brooklyn College to hear the Vermont senator explain why he should be the one to lead the Democrats to victory. Sanders played the hits from his previous campaign by calling out billionaires, Amazon, the military industrial complex, and more. But he also struck a more personal chord, presenting his background as the antithesis of Trump: He was raised in public housing by a father who fled the Nazis, educated in public schools, and active in the Civil Rights movement of the 60s. 
I did not have a father who gave me millions of dollars to build luxury skyscrapers, casinos, and country clubs, Sanders said toward the end of his speech. I did not come from a family that gave me a $200,000 allowance every year beginning at the age of three. As I recall, my allowance was 25 cents a week.
The rally demonstrated a couple things. First that Sanders, who has attracted attention throughout his career because of his unabashedly leftist views, is going to lean more on his backstory this time around. But also showed that many of his fans from 2016 havent lost their enthusiasm for him. VICE talked to attendees about why they are feeling the Bern again, or for the first time, and what they expect from him.
Robert Segel, 55, from Brooklyn
 VICE: Obviously, its not your first time around. What brought you around to Bernie in general?Robert: In general... the idea that were actually going to get some representation for working people. I was with Occupy in 2011, before that I worked on Wall Street. I see how these bastards behave. Having worked in the system, I really have grown allergic to it. I want someone who is going to come from outside and bring some real change.
 What do you think is going to differentiate 2020 from 2016?God I hope nothing! Bernies been saying the same thing for 37 years. If he changes his message just to try and just work an angle this time, then I dont know, hes letting me down. His angle was right the last time. Now, how they run the campaign... We wont have some politics-as-usual lizard person manhandling the Democrat Party to get her in, so with a flatter, fairer playing field thats what we need.
 Do you see anything from the other candidates that is intriguing you?There are intriguing things to look out for. Im seeing a lot of likable corporate Dems that Im trying to raise a red flag about. Clinton was a problem, but the Democratic Party, the Republicrats, the System, are the big problem. Joe Biden is part of that system. Cory Booker badly wants into that system. Kamala Harris is a very likable cop who wants into that system. These people are not progressives! They are bank-fellating business-as-usual corporate Dems. Im more worried about them.
 Alan Briones (left), 26, and Christopher Elie, 26, from Hopewell Junction, New York
 What brought you both out today?Alan: I go to school here and I live close, Im here every day. I was like, This is the best opportunity to be here anyway and support Bernie. I supported him last time too.Christopher: He told me about this event. Im all for it. I supported Bernie last election and Im optimistic this time.
 Is there anything youre expecting to be different this time around from the campaign?Alan: I feel like hes starting already from a place of strength. People gradually got to know him over the course of the whole thing last time. Hes standing for the same things his entire life basically and now more people are openly doing the same thing. He's the emblem for that. Hes continuing with that energy. Its more favorably seen in a way that makes me optimistic. Go Bernie.Christopher: I imagine just based on what hes been saying in the last couple of days hell be saying the same kind of stuff, which is what Im expecting and what Im hoping for.Alan: I feel like his big strength is that hes been so consistent over a long period of time. Its hard to see somebody who has so much integrity, not compromising on what he believes in and what he stands for, literally forever.
 What are some policies you like about him or are looking for in a candidate?Alan: Medicare for all, college not being so expensive and putting us all into student debt that were never going to pay off. All the things hes been talking about forever.Christopher: I think Bernie is the most equipped to kind of seize the political moment. Theres this whole conversation going on about whether now is the time we submit a moderate candidate to sweep up disenfranchised Trump people, or now is the time to strike back. I think Bernie represents this option to really seize the ability to make some real change when people are willing to try something new.
 Aeshah (left), 17, and Iqra, 18, both from Brooklyn
 What brought you out today?Aeshah: Ive heard of Bernie since 2016 from his first campaign. Seeing him now, hes trying to make a change again. I mean Donald Trump, come on
 What are some of his policies that you like?Aeshah: Healthcare. Healthcare I feel like is a big thing. Not many people can afford healthcare healthcare is really expensive, so him trying to reduce it and make it affordable for everyone is a good thing.
 Are there any other Democratic candidates youre interested in?Aeshah: Not really.Iqra: No. (laughs) Just Bernie, I love Bernie.
 A Noah Harrison (left), 25, from Bushwick by way of Atlanta and Kathryn Fuller, 23, from New York City
 What brought you here today?A Noah: For me, pure passion brought me here. I have never felt so strongly about a political figure in our country. Seeing Bernie in the last election cycle was just both really heartwarming and eventually heartbreaking. I feel like I learned so much. Bernies presence and his ideology has made me into the politically active person I am today. Its just such a dream to be here and this historic event, his first rally.
 Are you expecting him to stay the course or expecting him to change it up?Kathryn: I dont expect him to deviate from the points that he has been attempting to complete for his entire career as a civil servant. Which is a part of his campaign that I like. Ill also say that what makes him a strong candidate is that he is willing to listen to his constituents, and obviously now his larger audience of America.
 What differentiates him from the other candidates out now?Kathryn: I think obviously his length of tenure as a senator really does set him apart. We have actual hard evidence to believe hes consistent on the issues that he purports to be consistent on.A Noah: I think Bernie is incredibly unique. Hes such a genuine holdover from the Civil Rights era and a time when peoplefar less than todayreally had to fight if they werent of a very particular status.Kathryn: I think he hasnt compromised during his career, which for some is a detractor. For a lot of young people that are interested in having a candidate that doesnt compromise their beliefs, thats a highly attractive quality.
 Ramon Mendez, 26, from Astoria, New York
 Is there anything you expect that will different for Bernie this time around?Ramon: Yeah, I mean hes going to have to defend a lot against the fact that hes a white old man. But thats just a distractionJoe Bidens a white old man and people are acting like he can be president. The difference is that a bunch of Bernies campaignsMedicare for all, Green New Deal, things like thatare already being coopted by other candidates.
 What do you think he needs to do differently this time to clinch the nomination?Honestly, he has to appear even more to the left.
 You dont think going to the center is the best?No, not at all. Thats what lost Hillary the election and honestly if we try that again, were gonna lose. Its not pragmatic. We have to realize the country is leaning a lot to the left and that is the natural progression of things.
 If he doesnt get the nomination would you go Dem no matter what or sit it out?I live in New York so I have the advantage of maybe voting for a third-party candidate. So its either a Green Party candidate. If its someone like Warren Id vote for her. If its someone like Joe Biden no interest.
Gabriel Sanchez (right), 23, from Oklahoma but lives in New York now and Geoffrey Mcgee, 21, from North Carolina but lives in Bed-Stuy
 What brought you guys out today?Geoffrey: We were both really involved in the primary in 2016. We were both college students. We just thought, this is the moment. This is the time for us to really show our energy, show our passion. We care about climate change. We care about prison reform. We care about a decent living wage. We care about healthcare. No one is talking about it in this administration, we have to show politicians in charge that we mean business. Were out here today in the freezing cold for one reason, to show the power of the people. Thats why were out today.Gabriel: We care about the people and everybody else. Were teachers and we are fighting for equality every day.Geoffrey: We have students on the line. This is not just our future, this is not just their future. Its the future of their children, their childrens children. It goes and goes.

,"I can remember where I was when news of the great CO2 shortage broke; I was still in the birthing centre a little while after welcoming our second daughter into the world. I had been informed that there were supply issues a couple of weeks beforehand – mainly in mainland Europe but as yet, unsubstantiated. However, the team at gasworld continued to investigate the situation and soon discovered that CO2 had gone ‘critical’. One week later, and a storm in a pint glass was brewing as gas world broke the story and the world at large began to realise how important carbon dioxide (CO2) is to everyday life as the whirlwind of the world’s mainstream press reported on beer gas shortages and commodity production squeezes. CO2 supply crisis hits Europe Having been on paternity leave for the duration of the story unfolding, and the aftershocks rippling through end-user markets, it’s been interesting to observe the story ‘from afar’ and the mild panic that ensued. It’s still remarkable how little appears to be known about this gas, as one of the key aspects of the ‘Invisible Industry’ that the industrial gases business is – but I guess I should not be surprised after all these years reporting on it. CO2: Finally some recognition for a much maligned gas Personally, I’m certainly not surprised by the shortage itself or how it has arisen. We’re well aware of the balance that CO2 generators and CO2 suppliers have to strike in the period of March through to May, when a number of plants associated with the fertiliser industry close down for maintenance. That’s not to say that I or others had any inkling a shortage would occur, as the situation of fertiliser plants going down in the spring is a common occurrence. There are usually a number of other plants operating and also plenty of storage as suppliers ‘stock-up’ for the peak season. However, the supply chain is more complex as suppliers are reliant on the source of carbon dioxide (the generators) being available and it stands to reason that any product that is dependent upon another feedstock or process is susceptible to outages beyond its control. It reminds me of the global Helium Shortage 2.0 a few years ago now. Unlike production of the air gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon) which are produced almost ‘independently’ by air separation units (ASUs), helium is a commodity delivered though a complex supply chain. It is largely a by-product of natural gas exploration projects and that natural gas feedstock. Carbon dioxide is very similar, reliant as it is upon ammonia and to a lesser extent bio-ethanol and other chemical production processes. In the case of ammonia, this is also a feedstock that is renowned to be very seasonal in nature. Planned – and sometimes unplanned – maintenance downtime is common for ammonia or chemicals production facilities, just as it is for the natural gas plants that drive helium production. What we experienced with the CO2 shortage is a perfect storm of supply chain conditions that were largely beyond the control of the CO2 business itself. The maintenance procedures across key ammonia plants, bio-ethanol and chemical production facilities, as well as some CO2 plants themselves, coincided to create a lack of raw gas sourcing for CO2. This was compounded by the extreme heatwave that hit Northern Europe in May – creating an unprecedented demand for CO2 from the food &amp; beverage sector – and the major sporting event that is the FIFA World Cup. The harsh reality is that once a shortage unfolds, of the product that is available, if any of those suppliers have moved into Force Majeure conditions then volumes cannot be just moved around to meet demand hubs. CO2 shortage: Who’s afected so far? Lessons So what lessons have been learned? What this shortage does suggest is a lack of a Plan B for a market inherently dependent upon other factors. If this shortage has told us anything, it’s that we clearly need a diversification of the supply chain for the industry itself and those end-users that so rely upon CO2. Once a shortage has occurred, it’s always plausible that it could happen again – and we have seen CO2 shortages before in the past, just not at this scale. This is the fourth CO2 shortage in the last 10+ years, all with the same background of coinciding plant outages across the region. With the pricing of ammonia and natural gas as further determining factors in the supply chain (ammonia is currently down while natural gas is up, squeezing margins), there exists a certain level of sourcing fragility. Continuing to look at this on a commercial level, a lesson to be learned outside of the industry would be that this is not a simplistic market to better plan or control. A lot of talk swirled to the effect that someone in the gases sector should have been taking command of the situation and better planning or coordinating plant outages, without realising that this would in fact be illegal; competition law requires that competing suppliers must think, plan and act independently, however frustrating that may seem in the event of a shortage like we have just seen. Last week’s shortage also highlights a glaring need for greater CO2 recovery efforts, in my view. I’ve heard countless comments over the last couple of weeks such as, “you’d think they can just suck it out of the sky” and to an extent there’s some truth in that. They can and they do, I countered, and a relatively nascent CO2 capture/recovery market already exists. CO2 recovery – A utopian ideology But as I’ve pondered over the last couple of weeks away from the office, are we really doing it enough? Does this shortage tell us that we need even more deployment in CO2 recovery technology – and could that be part of the supply chain diversification in the future? The caveat to this point, of course, is that this is also not as simplistic or straightforward as it might seem – despite the widespread perception, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is actually very minimal. In fact, it can be pegged at around 500 parts-per-million (ppm), which is less than 0.05%. Not only is this in our own personal interests as levels anywhere near 1-2% would present both a global warming and intoxication hazard, it also underlines the common confusion between the levels of CO2 as a greenhouse gas and its actual concentration in the atmosphere – two very different things. Finally, it’s been concerning to hear questions raised over the need for food-grade CO2 in the beverages business and whether that can be circumvented, as a result of the media storm surrounding this shortage. This is another lesson in perception, panic and misunderstanding. Food-grade CO2 should never be in question, it is an ingredient and it’s law – besides which, food-grade and industrial grade CO2 are from one and the same capacity. There is no difference in where the product comes from, it is simply a further level of (necessary) purification that takes place post-production – and safety should never be compromised in the maelstrom of commercial alarm. “…the spot market is a less than safe bet if that product is clearly so important to your operations” Likewise, this one and the same capacity is exactly that – there was and is no supply being squirrelled off that could otherwise be released to the market. The product simply hasn’t been there, contrary to any of the largely uninformed lobbying that may have been taking place over the last fortnight, at both a commercial and government level. If it can’t be produced, then it isn’t there to be sold or re-allocated – and the spot market is a less than safe bet if that product is clearly so important to your operations. In the here and now, we understand that the shortage both in Europe and the UK will be relieved as the main culprits in the shortage – the fertiliser plants – start up again as market conditions change. The beer gas storm will, if you pardon the pun, soon fizzle out. But clearly there are long-term lessons to be learned from this particular market frenzy.",I can remember where I was when news of the great CO2 shortage broke; I was still in the birthing centre a little while after welcoming our second daughter into the world.,2018-07-06T20:24:54Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gasworld.com'}",CO2 shortage: Lessons learned from a storm in a pint glass?,https://www.gasworld.com/co2-shortage-lessons-learned/2015003.article,https://daykfmoc67thr.cloudfront.net/Pictures/2000x2000fit/0/3/7/1028037_Rob-Cockerill.jpg,,Gasworld.com,storm complex,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Roger Sinek Image caption Ken Simons (left) carrying a Magritte Ken Simons has had his hands on Picasso paintings, moved Tracey Emin's bed and manoeuvred an Antony Gormley sculpture though a third-floor window. For him, a famous painting or sculpture isn't just a precious creation to be admired - it's a practical puzzle. Will it fit through the door? How can it be carried? Which trolley is best to wheel it through the gallery? And, in the case of some outlandish modern sculptures - how does it fit together? As the long-serving art handling manager at Tate Liverpool, these have been Simons' first thoughts when faced with works by the likes of Dali, Rodin, Hockney and Freud. ""I never think of them in terms of value,"" Simons says. Yet he must have moved and installed art worth billions of pounds over the years. Image copyright Roger Sinek Image caption Simons with the wooden crates that contain the art He worked at Tate Liverpool from its opening in 1988 until his retirement last summer. Before that, he worked for a decade at the Tate in London. Now, to mark the Liverpool branch's 30th anniversary, Simons has been allowed to curate his own exhibition - titled Ken's Show - featuring 30 of his favourite works from the Tate collection. He says his chosen pieces - by JMW Turner, Phillip King, Barbara Hepworth, Mark Rothko, Graham Sutherland and more - ""explore the unseen elements of our world"". While his exhibition is on, Simons will also let visitors explore the unseen workings of the gallery itself in a series of tours and talks. His domain, until he retired, was the loading bay and workshop - the functional, industrial areas that are normally out of sight of visitors to the gentrified former warehouse. The job of the art handler begins at the heavy metal grille in the loading bay - the gallery's back door - where trucks carrying artworks pull up and disgorge the big wooden crates that contain the art. Image copyright Roger Sinek Image caption Ken Simons (right) handling a Mark Rothko painting Simons and his colleagues unpack them - wearing the obligatory latex gloves - and the works are checked for damage. ""Then we're placing them in the galleries with the curators - hanging pictures, setting up sculptures,"" he explains. ""In contemporary art there are many complicated installation pieces which can take a lot of work, often working with the artists or couriers from abroad. ""So it can be a complex task. And then we go through that process again to take the whole thing out."" The art doesn't always come in and out through the loading bay. ""A few years ago we had Rodin's Kiss in our foyer, which is about three tonnes of marble,"" Simons says. ""We had to have some special struts put underneath the floor to support it. ""We had to take out windows to get it in, and I had to talk to consulting engineers about the buildings because it's an old warehouse and a listed building."" Image copyright Roger Sinek Image caption Antony Gormley's Glider was brought in by crane in 1993 The challenges an art handler comes up against can vary radically. ""In the early days, we had an exhibition by Antony Gormley and most of his pieces are made of lead,"" he says. ""In the exhibition, we had a full-size glider made out of wood then covered in lead sheet. Of course, we had to bring that in in parts - the wings and fuselage - and had to crane it from the outside of the building to get it in. ""Then you get entirely different challenges. We had an exhibition a few years ago by an artist called Nam June Paik. He was one of the first artists to use videos in his pieces. ""His installation involved hundreds of potted plants and in among them were little TV sets. All the cabling and wiring had to be amongst all the plants, and every day we had to water all the plants. ""Another piece of his was a huge aquarium full of fish, so I had to get my team to do training on how to look after fish."" Image copyright PA Image caption Tracey Emin came to the gallery to arrange her famous My Bed Complicated sculpture installations usually come with instructions and photos to show how their parts should fit together, like a hideous self-assembly project. Two years ago, Tate Liverpool hosted Tracey Emin's My Bed: a famously messy, unmade bed accompanied by a floor strewn with used condoms, vodka bottles, cigarette packets and other flotsam from her life. That work arrived in one piece in a crate, Simons says. ""It's part of the deal that Tracey does come and install it itself. She will come and rearrange the bedding as she sees fit. ""We're there helping her unpack it out of the crate, as were our conservators, and they liaise directly with Tracey about exactly how to handle it and position it."" Does the bed comes with a box of used condoms that have to be strewn around once it's in situ? ""No, no, no,"" he replies. Image copyright Phillip King Image caption Phillip King's Within (1978-9) has been assembled on site for Simons' exhibition Working closely with artists is, Simons says, ""one of the glories of the job"" - normally. ""There's one or two in the past that have been awkward,"" he admits. ""But I'm not going to name names."" Has he ever dropped an artwork? ""There have been near occasions - but never, no.""

On Jan. 17, dozens of regional and state emergency managers were scheduled to convene in Miami for a weeklong course preparing them for the upcoming extreme weather season. The annual Emergency Management Institute, as it is formally called, is the main way federal authorities train their state and local counterparts on the basics of navigating deadly natural disasters, including when to begin evacuations and how to prepare for the effect of a storm surge.
But the course has been canceled this year and is unlikely to be rescheduledanother casualty of the current partial government shutdown, which is the longest in history. The Federal Emergency Management Authority, which conducts the training with specialists from the National Hurricane Center, may only provide services that directly apply to the protection of human life or the protection of property, a spokesperson tells Mother Jones. Day-to-day operations are close to fully staffed, but research, development, and training exercisesall key aspects of the outreach work these agencies do before hurricane season starts in Mayhave been suspended. Winter normally offers government staffers a reprieve from hurricane and tornado season, giving them time to update and test forecasting models in addition to training first responders in the event of future natural disasters. But none of that work can be completed during the shutdown.
Weve already lost three weeks. Were likely to lose a fourth week, says Eric Blake, union steward at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. You cant recreate this time.
This is also peak season for prep for severe weather season - storm spotter training, preparedness events and talks, EM meetings, etc - and none of that happens during the shutdown.

The timing could hardly be worse. The past few years have produced three of the five costliest hurricanes to hit the United States on record, including Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico and left roughly 3,000 people dead. This past years hurricane season was relatively mild by historical standards but still included two major storms and a series of horrific wildfires in California. This is an administration that thinks nothing of the future, says David Titley, a retired naval officer who formerly served as chief operating officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Even though many employees at NOAA, which includes the National Hurricane Center, have not been furloughed, their work is limited in scope and virtually impossible to do without the assistance of partner agencies. The Environmental Modeling Center in Maryland has been all but shuttered. More than 95 percent of NASA employees have been sent home, removing an important resource for scientists in need of satellite imagery for research.
This is an administration that thinks nothing of the future.
 David Titley
Ahead of severe weather season, these few weeks would normally be when government employees update and test existing forecasting models, but at the Environmental Modeling Center, which runs the current weather-forecasting model, only one staffer is working, according to the Washington Post. And that person is not tasked with fixing the model when it runs poorly, as it was reported to have done last month. The U.S. model is basically standing still. Nothings happening right now, Blake says. (Neil Jacobs, deputy administrator of NOAA, disputed this finding in an op-ed published in the Post and Courier, writing, Model accuracy ebbs and flows as a function of complex weather patterns.)
The National Weather Service had actually planned to use this winter to unveil a new global forecasting model as part of an ongoing effort to catch the United States up with better-performing models overseas. Its the best generation of hurricane models, Blake says. But the testing and research that are necessary before the models rollout are impossible to accomplish during the shutdown, which means it might not even be ready in time for hurricane season.
That lack of forward focus might blunt the accuracy of future forecasting models come hurricane season, but it already has eliminated a crucial opportunity to train emergency managers. Former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate told NPR that none of the emergency training sessions can be rescheduled this year. And that means those people are not getting the training they were trying to get to get better at what theyre doing, he said. Perennial staff shortages, which FEMA has acknowledged as a factor contributing to its scattershot response to Hurricane Maria, will not be addressed either. The agency cannot onboard new staffers during a shutdown.
A FEMA spokesperson noted in an email that emergency work as well as public infrastructure and mitigation projects are considered essential and not impacted by the shutdown. That designation does not include management training, despite sessions having essential-sounding names like Determining Which Critical Decisions Need to Be Made Based on Hazards, Vulnerability, Risk, and Impacts, according to a schedule reviewed by Mother Jones.
The FEMA spokesperson would only say, Training and exercises are suspended during a lapse in appropriations.","On Jan. 17, dozens of regional and state emergency managers were scheduled to convene in Miami for a weeklong course preparing them for the upcoming extreme weather season.

Germain Lussier,"The one person you dont expect to call you after a funeral is the person whose funeral you were just attending. But thats what happens to Los Angeles detective Jack Radcliff (SelmasDavid Oyelowo) after his niece Ashley (A Wrinkle In Times Storm Reid) is murdered. Somehow shes calling him, very much alive, even though shes dead. And things are off to the races.
Relive, which had its world premiere Sunday at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, was written and directed by Jacob Aaron Estes, who previously made the underrated festival films Mean Creek and The Details. And while those films are creepy and weird in their own ways, Relive feels much more familiar. Its basically a murder mystery whodunit, with an equally mysterious, time-travel sci-fi element. Think the Dennis Quaid-starring Frequency meets Christopher Nolans Memento.
That level of familiarity doesnt hurt the film, though, because its all blended together so well. Estes methodically structures the story, slowly doling out answers and posing more complex questions. For example, Jack doesnt immediately answer these impossible phone calls, and once he does, he doesnt instantly believe theyre real. It all unfolds rather logically. Early sections of the film are largely from Jacks perspective and have a distinct visual palette. Eventually, that changes too, and we get Ashleys side of the story with its own, slightly different look. Finally, once those two stories are up and running, Estes starts weaving them together and the whole movie just takes off.
Those are the best parts of Relive, when both Jack and Ashley are trying to figure out what the hell is going on simultaneously and Estes integrates both stories. It leads to tense, uncomfortable, and emotional scenes between this uncle and niece who are somehow connected, and disconnected, from reality. As we slowly see things from one storyline match up with things in the other story (or, better yet, contradict each other) theres a propulsive engagement to the film, eventually ending in some big revelations.
Within this weird murder mystery, both Oyelowo and Reid ground their characters in reality. Theres real pain and fear in both of their performances, which makes the more fantastic elements that much more believable. Estes then rounds out his cast with welcome familiar faces like Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump) and Alfred Molina (Spider-Man 2), both playing cops, as well as Brian Tyree Henry (Atlanta, Into the Spider-Verse), as Ashleys dad/Jacks brother, who all elevate the already interesting material.
Simply put, Relive is a watchable, engaging movie. However, the biggest problem is it sets up such a curious, cool story that when you get to the end, theres really no wholly satisfying way for it to pay off. Estes does as good a job as possible, but his conclusion pushes most of the sci-fi elements to the wayside, focusing more on the strong bond between family members. It works, and probably makes more sense for a bunch of reasons but, personally, without a better payoff for the weird stuff, I couldnt help but leave Relive a tiny bit disappointed. As entertaining as the film was, it doesnt stick the landing.
Relive was produced by Blumhouse and and will be released later this year, though it doesnt have a date yet.

Danica Coto / AP,"(CAROLINA, Puerto Rico) — Before the sun rose on the first day of 2018, someone called 911 to report the charred, bullet-riddled body of a man with a snake-like tattoo on his left hand, lying beside a road in the Puerto Rican town of Vega Baja. The next day, two men were found dead with their feet and hands bound in Bayamon, a working-class city southwest of the capital. Another man was shot to death before dawn in nearby Vega Baja while trying to stop thieves from stealing his generator. Thirty-two people have been slain in Puerto Rico in the first 11 days of the year, double the number killed over the same period in 2017. If the surge proves to be more than just a temporary blip, January could be the most homicidal month on the island in at least two years, adding a dangerous new element to the island’s recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst disaster in decades. While the number of homicides did not immediately spike in the weeks after the hurricane struck on Sept. 20, police and independent experts say many killings appear at least partly related to its aftereffects. The storm has plunged much of the island into darkness, increased economic hardship and contributed to a sickout by police, all fueling lawlessness. What’s more, officials say a turf war has broken out among drug gangs looking to grab territory after the storm’s disruption. “Hurricanes affect everyone, including criminals,” said criminologist Jose Raul Cepeda. Already bankrupt, the island’s overwhelmed government has fallen behind with millions of dollars in overtime payments owed to police officers, who have begun calling in sick in big numbers to protest. The sickout has taken about 2,000 police off the street each day in a territory that has 13,600 officers. It has forced more than a dozen police stations to close for several hours to a couple of days during the holiday period because of a lack of officers. No arrests have been made in the 32 killings this year. Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm, destroyed much of the island’s electrical grid. For those police on duty, the streets are darker and more dangerous because power has been restored to only 60 percent of customers in the U.S. territory. Drug gangs are fighting to re-establish territory they lost in the disruption from Maria, which pushed thousands from their homes and left entire neighborhoods uninhabitable for weeks. Police Chief Michelle Hernandez resigned Monday after only a year on the job, and local and federal authorities are rushing from meeting to meeting to debate how to best protect 3.3 million Puerto Ricans, especially those still living in the dark. “This has been devastating,” said Ramon Santiago, a retiree who lives less than a block from where three bodies were discovered Sunday near a basketball court. “You can’t sleep peacefully in so much darkness.” Puerto Rico’s homicide rate is roughly 20 killings per 100,000 residents, compared with 3.7 per 100,000 residents on the U.S. mainland. In the last two years, Puerto Rico has seen an average of 56 homicides a month, a rate that held through December. Then after New Year’s, the killings started accelerating. A man was shot Jan. 3 by a security guard while trying to rob a bakery. Two double homicides were reported Jan. 8 — two men found shot to death in a car near an upscale resort on the north coast and two other men discovered sprawled on the street near a public housing complex on the west coast. Five killings alone were reported Monday, in addition to three people wounded by gunfire during a shootout that night in the parking lot of a strip mall in Bayamon. This week, police say, the son of a former judge was killed after trying to write down the license plate number of a car whose occupants were firing a gun. “The lack of police is increasing Puerto Rico’s safety issues,” said legislator Denis Marquez, who was mugged at gunpoint last month. “Everybody is feeling that insecurity.” Besides policing and getting the lights back on, he said, the government needs to address long-standing issues such as social inequality on an island with a 10 percent unemployment rate, where nearly 45 percent of its inhabitants lived in poverty before the hurricane. More immediately, the post-storm conditions have fueled a deadly struggle over drug gang territory, said Fernando Soler, vice president of a police officers’ advocacy group. “There’s a war over the control for drugs,” he told The Associated Press. “They are taking advantage of all the situations occurring in Puerto Rico. There’s no power and they believe there’s a lack of police officers. … Criminals are taking care of business that was pending before the hurricane.” Inspector Elexis Torres heads a unit that is investigating eight homicides in a jurisdiction that includes the working-class city of Carolina near Puerto Rico’s north coast, bordering the island’s main airport. One of Puerto Rico’s largest cities with nearly 160,000 people, Carolina had the triple homicide reported Sunday; a motel employee and a friend were found slain Tuesday in neighboring Trujillo Alto. Like nearly all the killings this year, they involve men in their 20s who were shot to death. Torres said he suspects both cases are drug related. He worries the number of killings will only increase as criminal gangs enter into cycles of revenge. “Those victims likely belonged to some organization,” Torres said of the triple homicide. “This can have consequences.” Cepeda, the criminologist, said drug traffickers have been entering rival territories to increase sales and recover losses after the storm disrupted their business. Hurricane Maria caused an estimated $95 billion in damage, with 30,000-plus jobs lost in an economy that was already struggling from an 11-year-old recession. The last time Puerto Rico saw a spike in violent crime was in 2011, when a record 1,136 killings were reported on an island of nearly 4 million people. Puerto Rico had seen a drop in killings, to 700 in 2016 and 679 last year. Hector Pesquera, secretary of the newly created Department of Public Safety, met this week with top police officials and federal authorities. “We’re in a process of analysis and of committed work to fight criminality in Puerto Rico,” he said.",32 people have been killed in the first 11 days of the year,2018-01-11T20:57:36Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Murders in Puerto Rico Surge as Hurricane Maria Recovery Continues,http://time.com/5099781/puerto-rico-murder-rate-hurricane-maria/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/puerto-rico-murder-rate-hurricane-maria.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,storm complex,1
Samantha Mathewson,"New data from the European Southern Observatory shows raging storm clouds of iron and silicates swirling above a distant exoplanet. 
The exoplanet, formally known as HR 8799e
, orbits a young star called HR 8799, which is about 1.5 times the size of the sun and located about 129 light-years from Earth in the constellation Pegasus. 
HR 8799e was first discovered in 2010 and is the innermost star of the HR 8799 system. An estimated 30 million years old, this exoplanet is believed to be about nine times the mass of Jupiter
 and takes approximately 45 Earth years to orbit its parent star.

Artist's impression of the exoplanet HR 8799e, which orbits a young star called HR 8799, located roughly 129 light-years from Earth.
Using the GRAVITY instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), astronomers uncovered the complex atmosphere of this storm-wracked exoplanet. 
The GRAVITY instrument employs a technique called optical interferometry, which uses the light of four telescopes to see features that are 10 times more detailed than was previously possible, according to a statement from the ESO
. 
""Our analysis showed that HR8799e
 has an atmosphere containing far more carbon monoxide than methane — something not expected from equilibrium chemistry,"" Sylvestre Lacour, lead author on the new work and a researcher from the French space agency CNRS, said in the statement. ""We can best explain this surprising result with high vertical winds within the atmosphere preventing the carbon monoxide from reacting with hydrogen to form methane.""
The new data also revealed that the exoplanet's atmosphere contains clouds of iron and silicate dust, which, combined with an excess of carbon monoxide, suggests there is a violent planetwide storm.
""Our observations suggest a ball of gas illuminated from the interior, with rays of warm light swirling through stormy patches of dark clouds,"" Lacour said. ""Convection moves around the clouds of silicate and iron particles, which disaggregate and rain down into the interior. This paints a picture of a dynamic atmosphere
 of a giant exoplanet at birth, undergoing complex physical and chemical processes.""
Their findings, published March 27
 in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, may reveal new clues about the formation of planets and planetary systems, ESO officials said in the statement.

Engadget,"James Trew Managing Editor Weltenschlächter At the ripe old age of 28, the Atari Lynx doesn't get a lot of new games. While other retro consoles have thriving communities keeping them alive, the Lynx has a handful of dedicated fans. And, in turn, perhaps almost a single-digit number of people still making games for it. In that context, it's been a bumper year for the Lynx, with a bevy of boxed releases, thanks to Atari-Age forum member Der-luchs, whose Luch-soft imprint has released (or re-released) five titles for the Lynx over the past year. Best of all: Weltenschlächter. Weltenschlächter is a straight-up, no-nonsense arcade shooter. As with many games of the arcade era, the objective is simple: achieve the highest score. You play a budding intergalactic hero, fighting off an endless army of evolving evil aliens. The trick is that they hide behind protective walls, which you need to shoot down first. It's basically Space Invaders at 90 degrees, with more complex enemies. A bonus round every few levels sees you switch to avoiding oncoming adversaries, presumably as you fly to the next galaxy full of angry pixelated extraterrestrials. It's fast, fun and addictive, and the music's pretty good too. Runner-up: Alpine Games Alpine Games (2004) was re-released this year, putting it in many middle-aged hands for the first time. If you imagine Epyx's California Games in the snow, then you've just imagined Winter Games (also by Epyx). But you could also be imagining Alpine Games. Pick from among sports like snowboarding, slalom and bobsleigh for instant pick-up-and-play fun. 2018: Wyvern Tales The Atari Lynx doesn't have any real RPG games (although, weirdly, Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure is pretty close). Wyvern Tales -- an homage to early Zelda/Final Fantasy–style games -- will rectify that. The usual ingredients of weapons, level-up battles, puzzles and magic are here, with towns to explore and shopkeepers full of wisdom. Wyvern Tales has been in production for seven years, but it finally looks like it will get released in 2018. The cartridges should be able to save progress (unheard of in original Lynx games), which, if nothing else, means there should be plenty of hours of gameplay. David Lumb Contributing Editor Wolfenstein: The New Colossus Single-player shooters that tell a compelling, nuanced story are few and far between. But those that also confront a serious cultural anxiety while leading players into gleeful carnage are even rarer. Wolfenstein: The New Colossus may have stumbled into the zeitgeist, but its alt-history tale of vengeful resistance fighters prying the world from Nazi rule is delivered with solid writing and fantastic voicework. The sequel to 2014's The New Order one-ups its predecessor in many (but not all) ways: The upgrade system fades into irrelevance, and the levels aren't nearly as friendly to stealthy playstyles, but the game soars with its characters and set pieces. That alone isn't GOTY material. What's crucial, and what games usually fail to pull off, is showcasing very uncomfortable realities In The New Colossus ' case, it's a hideously evil regime supported by a complicit America. Nazis are easy to hate, but what about the people in our country -- our fellow Americans -- who, today, permit and enable bigotry-fueled power? Who willingly vote for it? Genre stories mask truth in exaggeration. Wolfenstein: The New Colossus might be one of the pulpiest games out there, but it isn't afraid to pummel our misplaced assumptions about who we think we are. Runner-up: PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Since my colleagues have named all the best titles of the year, I'll pick a game that gets more notice than praise: PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. It wasn't the first battle royale–type game, but it's single-handedly brought the subgenre into the mainstream and (for better or worse) turned it into eSports material. PUBG deserves recognition for widening a niche mode into a bona fide game category and maintaining around 2.5 million players a day -- even though it only left Early Access on December 20th. 2018: The Last of Us: Part 2 The last zombie game to grace anyone's most-anticipated list might have been Valve's 2009 classic Left 4 Dead 2. And while The Last of Us: Part 2 technically fits that subgenre, if it lives up to its predecessor, TLOU 2 will be so much more. The original told a heartbreaking story about fatherhood and sacrifice amid the ashes of civilization, with a chilling ending that cemented its place in the gaming canon. The sequel has a lot to live up to. But assuming Naughty Dog gives it the same treatment as Uncharted 4, TLOU 2 could be another iconic title to pull off your shelf when you need an emotional sucker punch.","It had just turned April when we declared that 2017 was a great year for video games.

The Conversation,"Coastal counties in North and South Carolina are still assessing damage from Hurricane Florence, which dropped up to three feet of rain in some areas in September. Now, along with southern Georgia, they face new forecasts of dangerous flooding from Hurricane Michael. Since the 1950s, coastal communities have ordered evacuations to move people out of the paths of dangerous storms. Coastal residents also prepare by building homes elevated above anticipated high water levels, and building codes commonly call for reinforced construction to endure high wind speeds. Today, however, risk from hurricanes is extending inland. Some of the worst damage from Eastern Seaboard hurricanes in the past several decades has come from inland flooding along rivers after storms move ashore. Hurricane evacuations typically direct coastal residents to retreat inland, but river flooding can put them at risk if there are not enough shelters and accommodations in safe locations. And inland communities may not take adequate measures to ensure the safety of their residents. Much of my research, including my book, "" Southern Waters: The Limits to Abundance,"" has focused on the complex historical geography of water in the American South. What I have seen is that inland river flooding linked to hurricanes and heavy storms is a huge risk in the Southeast, but receives far less attention in emergency plans than coastal areas. Warm, rainy watersheds The US Gulf coast and eastern seaboard are particularly susceptible to river flooding due to tropical weather that moves onshore. From New England to Georgia, a dense network of rivers flows down from the eastern Appalachians across the Piedmont — a broad, rolling plateau extending from the mountains to the coastal plain — and drains into the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Steep gradients move water quickly down the mountain slopes. On the Piedmont, many small streams merge and then become meandering rivers on the low-lying coastal plain. When tropical weather systems lumber onshore and move inland, they rise up the steep face of the Blue Ridge Mountains. As the saturated air moves upward, it cools and releases huge quantities of rain — a process known as orographic precipitation. This phenomenon, coupled with heavy rainfall dumped on lower elevations by these tropical systems, unleashes dramatic downpours that funnel into river networks and rush toward the sea, often spilling over the banks of overwhelmed channels. This map shows the rivers draining to the southeast US Atlantic coast. García, Ana María, Anne B. Hoos, and Silvia Terziotti/Journal of the American Water Resources Association/CC BY Planning centers on coastal communities A series of storms in the 1950s prompted federal agencies to start planning for extreme tropical weather events. In August 1954, Hurricane Carol grazed the Outer Banks of North Carolina before battering Long Island and Rhode Island and causing extensive flood damage in New England. Hurricane Edna followed a similar path two weeks later, but remained offshore. And an October storm dumped up to 10 inches of rain across the Appalachians as it moved inland, causing serious flooding, damage and fatalities in Maryland and Pennsylvania. In 1955 Hurricane Connie unleashed huge amounts of rain over upstate New York. Days later, Hurricane Diane produced modest damage along the coast, but caused extensive river flooding as it continued across New England. Although both of these storms made landfall in North Carolina, their impacts in the more heavily populated northeast spurred federal action.

Although both of these storms made landfall in North Carolina, their impacts in the more heavily populated northeast spurred federal action. The growing inland threat Hurricane Floyd in 1999 showed that tropical weather events could wreak havoc inland, mainly through river flooding. Floyd moved onshore near Cape Fear, North Carolina, in mid-September with wind speeds of about 105 miles per hour and traveled northward, dumping up to 20 inches of rain along a path stretching into New England and Canada. Copious rainfall pushed inland ahead of the storm's eye overwhelmed most of the rivers in eastern North Carolina. Emergency responders conducted hundreds of inland freshwater rescues. Some river flood crests did not occur until over a week after the storm had passed. Millions of hogs, chickens and other farm animals drowned, and dozens of animal waste lagoons overflowed, contaminating water supplies. Floyd's impact was compounded by the fact that it followed Hurricane Dennis by about 10 days, so soils were already saturated. And rivers were still at higher-than-normal stages when Hurricane Irene arrived a month later. Total damage from Floyd alone was estimated at US$6.5 billion, much of it from inland flooding. Massive floods in Columbia, South Carolina, in 2015 and southeast Louisiana in 2016, caused by rare heavy rainfall events, soaked major urban areas and triggered evacuations — again, mainly through river flooding. And in 2017, Hurricane Harvey dropped at least 52 inches of rain on Houston in six days, an amount NASA described as ""unfathomable."" Prepare inland As the record shows, places adjacent to the sea are not the only danger zones during hurricanes. Inland river flooding from hurricanes is a major risk, particularly in areas with dense populations. Urban expansion and suburban sprawl have placed more people in areas where no one lived in 1955. The Florida panhandle and Georgia Piedmont have seen extensive development. As warmer ocean temperatures contribute to heavier rainfalls and slower moving hurricanes, inland flooding is likely to increase. Until hurricane planning fully incorporates this threat, coastal communities will risk evacuating people straight into harm's way and inland residents will share a false sense of security.","The southeast of the US is at risk for more flooding from Hurricane Michael because they are still recovering from Hurricane Florence.

Kissimmee, Florida (CNN) With no running water, no power and no school for her kids, Carmen ""Millie"" Santiago fled Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit the Caribbean last fall. Like thousands of evacuees, she landed here in central Florida. And, like hundreds, she's still stuck in a motel. Seven months after the storm, the quick-witted 50-year-old with chestnut hair and a warm smile has become the de facto mayor of ""El Super Ocho,"" or Super 8, the beige motel in the shadow of Disney World where she lives with her husband and two children. She keeps business cards of apartment managers, case workers and potential employers spread out on a table by the motel room door -- anything that might help her neighbors figure out how to survive the complex and increasingly eternal limbo they find themselves in. This week, hundreds of evacuees were told they would be booted from the motels where they've lived rent-free on assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. On Friday at 1 p.m., after mounting pressure from members of Congress, Puerto Rico's governor and evacuees like Millie, as well as multiple inquiries from CNN, FEMA announced it would extend the motel assistance for Maria survivors until May 14. Millie and others didn't know where they would have gone without the extension. And after what one advocate described as a week of panic, they still don't know what will happen next month. She does know what happens to evacuees who lose the motel vouchers, though: There's the mother of two who says she slept several nights in a car after FEMA's motel-room assistance ran out in March. There's the family of eight -- four children, their parents and grandparents -- who slept together in a motel room with only two beds. In that room on a recent day, a 7-year-old girl ate spaghetti for lunch using the end of a plastic coat hanger as a utensil. Some families say they've relocated four, five and six times to avoid sleeping on the streets. Meanwhile, shelters near Kissimmee, the southern suburb of Orlando that's come to be known as ""Puerto Rico north,"" are full. Low-income housing is unavailable. Rents are out of reach. Non-profits have been sapped of resources. And federal aid for the evacuees either is running out or was never offered. At issue are two FEMA housing programs. One, called the Transitional Shelter Assistance program, pays motel bills for people whose homes were damaged in Puerto Rico, even if the disaster victims left the island. That program, according to FEMA documents, was designed to be used for about two weeks. It has been extended repeatedly. More than 1,200 cases in the 50 states had been determined by FEMA to be ineligible for continued assistance after this week, according to documents provided to CNN, with about half of those cases in Florida. In a letter to FEMA on Wednesday, Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, requested an ""unconditional extension"" of the motel program. ""It is vital that FEMA approve this request immediately so that countless Puerto Rican families, who have lost everything as a result of this catastrophic disaster, are not once again uprooted in a chaotic fashion,"" he wrote. ""If FEMA does not approve the (Puerto Rico) government's request, students currently finishing the school year in the mainland will be deprived of their education, as well as their housing."" It's not clear whether FEMA will decide to extend the program beyond May 14. The federal agency contests the assertion that it would put people out on the street by ending their assistance. The Transition Shelter Assistance program is meant to provide emergency housing in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. It is ""tragic"" so many families have had to continue to live in motels for months without other viable housing options, said Mike Byrne, FEMA's federal coordinating officer for Puerto Rico, in an interview with CNN last week. ""There comes a point when these problems are no longer really disaster problems but are social problems,"" Byrne said. ""The idea that we're throwing people on the street -- there's no accuracy, there's no truth to that type of thing. ""We are doing everything we can to help these people,"" Byrne said, ""but if their home is fixed, or they have the ability to stay with family or friends... and they choose that they don't want to go back (to Puerto Rico), then, quite frankly, they fall out of this program"" offering motel rental assistance. ""They've made a decision not to use the assistance that we've provided,"" he said. ""That's their decision. And this is a free country."" Applicants can lose the FEMA motel vouchers if their homes in Puerto Rico are found to be livable, after inspection; or if FEMA finds they have other viable housing options, such as friends they could live with, among other requirements, said Byrne. Those restrictions were at least temporarily lifted to allow disaster victims to keep getting assistance until next month. Evacuees should contact FEMA if they believe their case was handled unfairly, Byrne said, and individual aid may be extended beyond May 14 if warranted. Transitional Shelter Assistance isn't the only FEMA program stirring controversy, however. Another FEMA program, called Direct Lease, could pay for longer-term rentals, which advocates say would be more humane and prevent homelessness among evacuees. That FEMA housing program, however, has not been made available to Hurricane Maria evacuees living in Florida or other US states. FEMA is offering that assistance only to evacuees who return to Puerto Rico, or to people who never left the island. FEMA will go so far as to pay for a person's flight back to the Caribbean island, Byrne said. No one has taken the agency up on that offer yet, he said. Asked why the Direct Lease program is not offered in Florida, Byrne at first said that he believed Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló had not requested it. CNN, however, obtained a January 31 letter to FEMA from a member of the Rosselló administration requesting Direct Lease assistance for ""eligible evacuees from Puerto Rico not only here on the island, but also for those located across the United States."" In response, Byrne said it would not be prudent to provide long-term lease payments for people living in Florida rather than in the territory directly hit by the disaster. In his lengthy career, which has included working on the response to Superstorm Sandy and other emergencies, FEMA had never provided long-term housing in that way, he said. ""The reason they are eligible (for FEMA assistance) is because they had a home in Puerto Rico. And so we're going to provide the option of a home in Puerto Rico,"" he said. In the void, at least in part, there's Millie. She receives many of the evacuees' tearful phone calls. They knock on her motel door late at night. She tries to counsel her neighbors and new friends as they are evicted and struggle to find affordable housing -- a process some evacuees described as so stressful it had induced panic attacks. And she coordinates with community advocates and aid organizations. In short: She's trying to help others before herself. ""The captain is always the last to leave the ship,"" she said. Researchers fear an 'exodus' from Puerto Rico Central Florida long has been a destination for Puerto Ricans. The island is a US commonwealth home to 3.3 million American citizens, and residents can move freely to the 50 states without visas or other documentation. New York once was seen as the mecca for Puerto Rico outmigration. It's been eclipsed more recently by Florida, in part because of the warm climate that's more similar to Puerto Rico and also because of what community advocates call the ""Disney Dream"" -- a fairy-tale vision of Orlando and its theme parks. Puerto Rico was suffering a massive and unprecedented population loss before Hurricane Maria hit, largely because of a debt crisis that bankrupted the island's government and crippled the economy. After Maria, some demographers told CNN they feared an ""exodus"" lasting many years, with repercussions for Puerto Rico and for host communities on the mainland. As CNN reported in February, Florida -- particularly the Orlando-Kissimmee area -- appears to be the top destination for Maria evacuees. That assessment is based on a review of FEMA disaster assistance data and US Postal Service change-of-address requests from Puerto Rico. While it's impossible to say exactly how many people fled the island after the storm, estimates range from thousands to more than 100,000. In Florida alone, the state's department of education told CNN this week that nearly 12,000 new students from Puerto Rico have enrolled in public schools in the months since Hurricane Maria. The two top school districts for enrollees in Florida were Orange County, which includes Orlando, and Osceola County, which is home to Kissimmee. Evacuees are arriving to find that Orlando and Kissimmee offer anything but the ""Disney Dream"" they imagined -- or that they saw on vacations and heard about from relatives. Like many cities in the United States, Orlando and Kissimmee suffer from a crippling affordable-housing shortage, making it difficult if not impossible for evacuees to find stable housing outside of motels. A March report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition named Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford the third-worst large metro area in the nation in terms of affordable housing availability. For every 100 renters needing low-income housing, the report said, only 17 units are available. Government housing programs are not meeting needs, either. The Orlando Housing Authority told CNN it had 18 units -- total -- available when the storm hit. Neither that housing authority nor Osceola County, which includes Kissimmee, had any new and available Section 8 vouchers that could be used by evacuees. Those vouchers let recipients search for subsidized housing. Only evacuees who brought Section 8 vouchers from Puerto Rico could qualify to transfer those vouchers, according to Vivian Bryant, president and CEO of the Orlando Housing Authority. ""We haven't received a new allocation of Section 8 vouchers,"" Bryant said. ""We are 101% leased up. We don't even have anything we can offer anybody."" Non-profits and churches are strained, too. There are currently no open shelter beds for homeless people in the Orlando metro area, said Martha Are, executive director of the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida. Additionally, the one shelter that serves homeless people in Osceola County, where many evacuees live along US Highway 192, takes only domestic-violence victims, she said. So if evacuees came to a shelter after getting kicked off the FEMA motel program, would they be turned away? CNN asked. ""That's right,"" she said. With federal help lacking, the financial burden of helping Maria evacuees in Florida is falling -- and falling hard -- on churches and non-profits, said Rev. Jose Rodriguez, from Iglesia Episcopal Jesús de Nazaret in Orlando. His congregation had been helping pay the rent of some Puerto Rico evacuees who lost or were not granted FEMA motel assistance, he said. But in mid-April the church had run out of grant money and donations, he said, and would have to stop assisting evacuees at least temporarily. In his view, FEMA is leaning too much on goodwill. ""They're homeless. They're couch surfing,"" he said of evacuees. Programs that should be helping them transition to a stable life in Florida are ""failing them,"" he said. Sociologists have documented what they call ""disaster fatigue"" that sets in months after an event like Hurricane Maria. People who may have been inclined to donate to Puerto Rico immediately after the September storm may not realize, or care, that needs continue so many months later, both on and off the island. Advocates in Florida worry that this fatigue may be without remedy. Meanwhile, the influx of Puerto Rican evacuees is expected to continue. Thousands of homes on the island have not had power in seven months. Just this week, the entire island was temporarily without electricity in a major blackout. Eight people, two beds, one motel room At dawn, the kids walk out of motels to bus stops on a highway. Some are the children of Maria. Their homes were damaged or destroyed when the September hurricane smashed into Puerto Rico; they were left without power or running water, often both, for months; their parents were left jobless, or without clear job prospects on the island; and many of their schools were closed. In short: They fled for a safer, better life. Florida said they were welcome. ""As Puerto Rico rebuilds, Florida remains committed to doing everything we can to help the families impacted by Hurricane Maria and aid in the recovery process,"" Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement issued October 2, the same day Florida declared a state of emergency in reference to the arrival of Puerto Rican migrants. Millie, the ""mayor"" of the Super 8 in Kissimmee, said she heard via social media that Florida planned to welcome evacuees and help them enroll in schools. She ran a day care -- named ""El Palacio de los Niños,"" or The Children's Palace -- in Carolina, a town not far from San Juan. She needed to find a personal generator to keep it operational. She came to Florida, she said, to enroll her kids in school and to sort out how to reopen her business. Later, however, inspectors closed the daycare because of her absence and because the facility lacked power and running water, she said. That's when she decided to stay here. Perhaps it's her experience with that daycare -- the parents of her students still send her photos from Puerto Rico; she misses the kids dearly -- that prepared her for the role of caring for evacuees. With so many people in need, she felt like she had to help. She does so joyfully, laughing as often as she cries. Asked if there were some evacuees she hadn't been able to help adequately, she responded: CNN interviewed more than a dozen evacuees in the Orlando and Tampa metro areas. Few expressed any desire to return to Puerto Rico. And despite the difficulties they've had adjusting to motel life, many were grateful to FEMA, charitable organizations and family members who had given them places to stay. Dacny L. Quintero Segarra talked about the situation on the walkway outside her motel room in the Baymont Inn and Suites on US Highway 192 in Kissimmee -- a stretch of road, also known as Vine Street, that's home to at least 10 motels listed by FEMA as accepting motel vouchers. She had a Walmart bag tied over her hair. Beneath it, she had applied an ointment, she said, to stop the rest of her hair from falling out. She attributes the problem to stress. ""I feel like this is Narnia,"" she said -- like everything is turned around. ""The housing situation is very, very, very bad,"" she said. ""Everything is a 'no.' They say they're going to help you but we've only helped each other -- Puerto Ricans banding together. I'm not interested in material things. All I want is shelter for my kids."" Quintero told CNN that FEMA offered her a free flight back to Puerto Rico. ""If I tell them I want to go back to Puerto Rico, they would say, 'Here's the money, buy your tickets.' But it's not just that. I want to live here,"" she said, primarily because there are jobs and schools. Downstairs, her parents, Alfredo Quintero and Dacny Segarra, who goes by the same name as her daughter, live in a room with wide doors to accommodate Alfredo's wheelchair. The elder Dacny said she had stopped taking medicine she needs to prevent blood clots because she has no health insurance in Florida and can't afford the pills without it. She said she was hospitalized in Florida because of blood clots in her legs. The older couple was told this week that they would lose FEMA assistance after April 20. That was before FEMA announced the extension into May -- an announcement that came the day before their scheduled eviction. Carlos Lara Santos, who is raising a baby girl, Valentina, born on April 2, already knew he'd get to stay until May 14, he told CNN. The family is living in the Super 8 with seven children, including the newborn. ""If you have a home, it's comfortable, the conditions are better,"" he said. ""If you have to raise a child in a hotel room, it's not the same."" Without FEMA assistance, some families end up in a cycle of motel eviction and debt. Liza Hernandez had been living in a two-bedroom unit at the Super 8 in Kissimmee with seven of her relatives. Initially, the family got help with hotel fees from FEMA, she said, but that ran out. They were able to start paying for the Super 8 on their own because three of the eight family members work. Then the hotel rate went up to $113.40 per night. The family fled to the Unno Boutique Hotel -- $50.22 per night. There, all eight were crammed into one room with two beds. They haven't been able to find an apartment, she said. At the other end of the highway, near a gift shop shaped like a massive orange -- ""Welcome to Florida: Take Some Home"" -- and another shop shaped like a wizard, Yamil Rodriguez was staying in a Holiday Inn. He said he had been putting the room on a credit card, and the hotel staff had been nice enough not to run the charge. He knew it wouldn't last, though. ""I'm waiting for a miracle,"" he said. On April 9, he sent a panicked message to a reporter. ""I'm on the street right now."" Rodriguez landed in another motel later that night. He and several other evacuees expressed gratitude toward the hotels that have housed them these past months. Many know the names of their housekeepers and greet them with hugs. Rodriguez said the Holiday Inn was kind to let the family stay as long as it did. Some Maria migrants know friends or family members in Florida and stay with them -- at least for a time. ""There's a saying in Spanish: 'After three days, the dead start to smell,"" said Julio, 53, who had been living, along with his wife and five of his six children, with a niece near Tampa. ""The house is getting small."" The landlord threatened to evict all of them on April 15, including the niece, if Julio and his family didn't move elsewhere, he said. By April 19, he'd moved to Jacksonville to live with his adult son and to look for work. The place is too small for all of them, he said, so his wife and five kids are still living with the niece in secret. ""It's like they're hiding out,"" he said. (CNN is not using Julio's last name in order to protect the family.) Julio expected to start work through a job placement service later this week. He hopes to save up enough money so they might get their own place -- eventually. ""Thank God we're alive, you know, so we can continue on this journey,"" Julio said. Still, this sort of uncertainty can be exhausting -- and potentially dangerous. Melissa, a young mother of three, said her home in Puerto Rico was so damaged that she initially slept on the floor of her mother-in-law's house on the island. That situation became untenable so she decided to come to Florida. She didn't know anyone here well enough to ask for a place to stay, she said, so she slept in the airport in Orlando. ( The Florida governor ordered welcome centers be established in major airports in the state; Melissa, whose full name CNN is withholding to protect the privacy of her children, said she did not see the welcome center in Orlando). In total, her family has lived in six locations since Hurricane Maria, she said. In March, when she lost FEMA motel assistance, she and her husband slept in their cars with their children, ages 4 and 9, for three nights. ""FEMA just told me, 'Call the Red Cross or look for a shelter,'"" she said. FEMA declined to comment on individual circumstances, citing privacy laws. Melissa posted a praying-hands emoji and a cryptic plea for help on her Facebook page. A friend responded with a temporary place to stay. She wore out her welcome before ending up back in motels. Now the family is paying $500 per month, she said, to rent a single bedroom in a house. She's not sure how long that will last, but it's better than paying weekly motel fees. ""I'm really thankful for the help we've gotten,"" said Melissa. ""They gave me jackets and blankets and supplies. The school treated us well. ""But FEMA? When there are children, you can't let people sleep on the street. It's not the same for an adult to be on the street as for kids to be."" 'This could have been done far more humanely' Disaster experts, community advocates and Democratic politicians are similarly critical. The longer children live in motels the more likely they are to be exposed to ""toxic stress"" that can contribute to long-term problems in school and mental health issues, said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University in New York. ""It is an extremely urgent matter to get these families with their children into a stable situation that is predictable and reestablish a sense of routine,"" he said. Redlener said motels don't do that. ""It's an extremely makeshift, temporary answer to a very complex problem,"" he said. ""It doesn't work for long, living in a motel, especially a crowded motel. It is a terrible situation for a young child."" People who flee disasters often think they will be able to escape trauma by relocating, he said, but that rarely proves to be the case. The hurricane follows them. The best way to help disaster survivors recover, he said, is to provide longer-term apartment housing. FEMA does offer a ""Rental Assistance"" program for hurricane victims, both in Puerto Rico and in the 50 states. The agency has allocated $121 million to that effort, but officials told CNN they were unable to say how many recipients of that assistance were living in the states versus Puerto Rico. The program provides disaster survivors with a monthly rental payment for up to 18 months, depending on eligibility. That payment, however, according to a FEMA spokesperson, is based on the rental market in the community where the person lived at the time of the disaster, not where they are currently living. That means a person who fled Puerto Rico for Florida would get paid a rental stipend based on the rental market in Puerto Rico, the spokesperson said, not that of Florida, which is far more expensive. The fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is $530 per month, according to a US Department of Housing and Urban Development index. In Osceola County, Florida, it's $1,096 -- more than double. Those amounts can be adjusted depending on family circumstances and other factors. As for the Transitional Shelter Assistance program, more than 7,000 applicants have gotten motel vouchers as part of the Hurricane Maria recovery, according to FEMA. About 2,700 applicants still were staying in motels as of mid-April, nearly seven months later, according to Byrne, the FEMA official in Puerto Rico. Nearly 40% of those current residents are in Florida. In all, FEMA has spent $64.4 million on the motel program for Maria victims. ""Just like a shelter is not intended to be a long-term solution for somebody, a hotel room... was never intended to be a long-term solution,"" said Byrne, the FEMA official. ""What we work hard at is to provide overarching case management to these families... to help them find a way back into their home (in Puerto Rico)."" He added, ""I don't think anybody wants to stay in a hotel.... It gets old fast. Imagine if you had your whole family with you in a one-room hotel. We want to try to find another solution for those people (who are still living in hotels) as quickly as possible."" Without more transitional help, however, hurricane victims ""fall off a cliff"" when they're booted from motels, said Rodriguez, the Episcopal priest in Orlando. ""Stop kicking this can down the road and just give them permanent housing,"" he said. ""There needs to be a game plan. It's a waste of taxpayer money to be dumping money into hotel stays."" The whiplash of the threatened voucher cutoffs and last-minute extensions causes unnecessary turmoil for disaster survivors, he said. ""We have three weeks for people to find homes,"" he said, referring to the May 14 FEMA cutoff. ""They lost a week in panic, now we have three weeks to find them homes. How are we going to house over 1,000 people?"" ""We still have these families who are going to have to vacate before the end of the school year,"" he added. The fact that the Direct Lease program -- which can provide housing for 18 months or sometimes longer -- is offered in Puerto Rico, but not in Florida, has been criticized by US Rep. Darren Soto, a Democrat who represents Kissimmee and central Florida. ""This could have been done far more humanely if the Trump administration would have approved long-term lease vouchers,"" Soto told CNN. ""It would have allowed these people to save up enough money for a deposit and live in a far more humane environment.

FEMA officials have said repeatedly that they're handling Hurricane Maria's recovery as they would any other storm of this magnitude, regardless of the fact that Puerto Rico is not a US state, does not have voting members in the US Congress -- and that its residents can't vote for president.

"Dennis Mersereau, Dennis Mersereau","One of the scariest things you can hear before a hurricane hits is that someone wont evacuate because the storm hasnt hit a certain category yet. Coastal residents over reliance on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a dangerous prospect when a storm makes landfall. Hurricane Florence is the latest example of a storm that vastly over-performed its category on the scale. It made landfall as a category one, but that bottom-of-the-scale ranking doesnt come close to describing the destructive storm surge or historic rainfall left in its wake. How do we fix the disconnect between a storms perceived strength and its actual hazards? Its a tough call, and, unfortunately, it may not be possible to ditch the wind scale and start over. The inevitable post-Florence debate among meteorologists and emergency managers included talk of scrapping the Saffir-Simpson Scale. As a weather reporter whos spent years trying to talk about threatening hurricanes, I dont think thats entirely possible. The categories we use to describe wind strength in hurricanes is too deeply ingrained in the weather education of the United States to be able to completely remove it from the discussion. We have to work with the scale so that people in harms way pay proper attention to the winds, but also focus on the hazards posed by heavy rain and storm surge. Developed by engineer Herbert Saffir and former Director of the National Hurricane Center Robert Simpson, the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale came about in the early 1970s to help meteorologists convey the destructive potential of a hurricane. Each category from one to five describes a new degree of potential damage in the areas that experience a storms highest sustained winds. A category one hurricane would produce superficial damage to a well-built homebreaking windows, gutters, and shingleswhile the strongest winds of a category five hurricane would make rubble of even a sturdy structure. This scale doesnt always accurately describe the threat posed by storms. The majority of people who die in landfalling storms drown as a result of a storm surge or freshwater flooding from heavy rain. Hurricane Florence was only a category one when it made landfall in North Carolina on September 14, 2018, but the hurricanes large wind field brought a magnitude of storm surge flooding to the coast typically seen in a storm with much higher winds. Even worse, interior sections of North Carolina saw devastating flooding after the slow-moving storm produced up to three feet of rain in the days after landfall. There are countless examples of storms that had effects much greater than their maximum sustained winds would suggest. Hurricane Ike, which devastated southeastern Texas in 2008, made landfall with the winds of a category two storm, but its size drove a storm surge greater than 20 feet deep into parts of the coast. Hurricane Katrina was a category three hurricane at landfall in Louisiana and Mississippi, but its size and former strength produced a storm surge youd expect to see in a scale-topping storm. Hurricane Harvey made landfall as a category four near Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017, leaving behind extensive wind damage where the eye came ashore. But Harvey drenched southeastern Texas and Louisiana for days after it weakened to a tropical storm, bringing about unprecedented rains and flooding, including an astounding five-foot rainfall total near Beaumont, Texas. Still, while the greatest threat to life in a landfalling hurricane is from drowning, we cannot discount the effects of winds. Entire neighborhoods saw total devastation after the 165 MPH winds of Hurricane Andrew made landfall in southeastern Florida in August 1992. Flying debris, falling trees, and building damage can seriously injure or kill people if theyre not properly protected. Strong winds over soggy soil can lead to extensive power outages along the path of a landfalling storm, even far inland from the coast. More than a million people across the Carolinas lost power at one point during Hurricane Florence. The lingering effects of wind damage can prolong suffering for many days and weeks. So how do we effectively broadcast a storms true threat level? Theories pop up after every big storm. Some meteorologists think we should scrap the system entirely and try to wean people off of thinking of storms in terms of categories at all. Others think its worth exploring a way to replace the existing scale with a complex formula that accounts for winds, storm surge, and expected rainfall totals, indexing all those factors into a standardized value. Another (likely-confusing) possibility is creating separate scales to characterize each individual hazard. Meanwhile, the growing intensity of storms in general has some arguing that, should we continue to use the wind scale, we should add a sixth category to reflect higher maximum wind speeds. But the best course of action is likely to downplay the scale while talking-up the non-wind threats of a storm. Meteorologists did a fantastic job getting the word out that the biggest threat in Florence was the flooding. Even so, some coastal residents opted to stayor even went back homeafter hearing that the storms winds had weakened a bit while Florence made its final approach. Many of those people found themselves stranded for days without power as most of the roads in and out of the area were later severed by flooding. It would take generations to train ourselves not to think of hurricanes in terms of category strength. That leaves it up to us to recognize the strength of a storms winds while also paying attention to its other hazards when they may pose the greatest threat to life and property. Meteorologists have to recognize the limitations of using categories to characterize storms and, just as they did during Florence, drive home the message that flooding can be even more dangerous. Improving weather forecasts is a team effort. A forecast is only successful when the people who need them can use them effectively.","Environment The Saffir-Simpson Scale isn't working, but we can't abandon it.

"Aisha Harris, Aisha Harris","Oprah Winfrey as Mrs. Which and Storm Reid as Meg Murry in Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time. Ava DuVernay excels at making her characters feel utterly, wholly human, even when the fully realized worlds around them threaten to swallow them. She’s made audiences care deeply about a woman who puts her career on hold to provide emotional support for her incarcerated husband, and she’s deftly re-emphasized and recontextualized the devastating emotional toll of the country’s incarceration complex. In Selma, she grounded a historical movement that’s been glossed over and bowdlerized by time and memory, reminding us that there were real people at its center, and in Queen Sugar, which she created, a black farming family in contemporary Louisiana is filled out with an array of characters, all of them with rich backgrounds, clear desires, and distinct personalities. Understanding all of this about the prolific filmmaker, I take no pleasure in reporting that her latest feature, A Wrinkle in Time, stumbles in its world building and can’t quite find its groove. With DuVernay working on her largest canvas yet—the Disney film’s $100 million budget dwarfs Selma ’s $20 million—this adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s beloved and controversial sci-fi fantasy novel features a (mostly) outstanding cast and a refreshingly bizarre story that it seems unsure how to deal with. The film opens somewhere much more down to Earth, as we see a young Meg Murry bond giddily with her NASA scientist parents, Alex (Chris Pine) and Kate (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), in their home laboratory. After she’s given a handmade fortune teller with a heart drawn upon it, which when opened, causes the heart to disappear (“Our love is not gone,” they tell her, “it’s just enfolded”),we cut to the present day, where a teenage Meg (Storm Reid) and her doting, precocious younger brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), confront the fourth anniversary of Alex’s mysterious disappearance. Meg is now a sullen loner, described as “hostile” by her school principal (André Holland, in an all-too-small role). All of which, of course, is only prelude to her Call to Adventure. At home later that night, a witch (Reese Witherspoon) in a billowing gown with a truly otherworldly amount of ruffles suddenly appears in their living room. Her name, she explains, is Mrs. Whatsit, and she and Charles Wallace are already well-acquainted. She tells a bewildered Kate that she and her husband had been correct, that “There really is such a thing as a tesseract” (a fifth dimension that folds in space and time) before vanishing into the night as abruptly as she arrived. A Wrinkle in Time milks Oprah’s life-coach persona for all it’s got. All of this occurs within the first 15 minutes, which may leave the audience with a bit of whiplash, as they’ve barely had a chance to become attached to Alex and begin grieving before we’re on our way to rescue him. No sooner has Mrs. Whatsit come and gone than a classmate named Calvin (Levi Miller, who previously starred as Peter Pan in Pan ) is introducing himself the next day, instantly smitten with Meg after seeing her stand up to a bully, and tagging along as Charles Wallace introduces them both to another mysterious friend, Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), and finally, the ethereal Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey). The three “Misses” have been contacted by Alex, who is trapped somewhere far out in the universe (or is he in another dimension?), and it’s up to Meg to find him and destroy the evil thing—known as the It—that’s keeping him there. As Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin embark on their mission, the plot zips along, with our protagonist repeatedly establishing herself as a girl plagued with insecurities about her looks and capabilities as everyone around her insists she’s an extraordinary human. It’s standard storybook stuff, but it’s made new again by the fact that this character is a girl, and a girl of color at that. When the recognition of this is subtle, such as when Calvin compliments Meg’s curly hair, and she hardly believes him, it’s effective. More often than not, however, her talents are remarked upon in overwrought, clumsily spoken dialogue, such as when, after Meg has put her physics expertise to use in order to save them both from a tornadolike phenomenon, Calvin stares at her googly eyed and coos, “You have no idea how incredible you are, do you?” Perhaps this kind of repeated underlining will help kids catch on, but adults are likely to be left thinking, We get it already. In casting Winfrey as the sage leader of the Misses, A Wrinkle in Time milks her life-coach persona for all it’s got, and comments about Mrs. Which’s size (she can make herself appear as small as a human or loom as large as Lady Liberty) resonate with Winfrey’s many years coming to terms with her dimensions in public. Up to this point, Oprah’s occasional forays into acting have always been imbued with not just dignity but also complexity—think Sofia in The Color Purple or Gloria in The Butler —but here the anointments of deity so many have conferred upon her for years now are rendered literally. Meanwhile, Witherspoon’s Mrs. Whatsit, who exudes the spunk and sass of Mrs. Frizzle, and Kaling’s Mrs. Who, whose human vocabulary is limited to famous quotes from Buddha to OutKast to Lin-Manuel Miranda, provide a welcome balance of levity. Watching A Wrinkle in Time unfold, I had to keep checking myself, wondering if perhaps the reason the film wasn’t working for me was because I’m not its target audience—a young adult. Indeed, the film leans heavily into the perspectives of its youthful protagonists, to the point where at times it feels like it were actually the fantasy of a 14-year-old kid. The generically beautiful Calvin is Ansel Elgort lite, and his flirtations with Meg fall flat and feel shoehorned in. Later, the narrative takes a turn into demonic child territory, and Charles Wallace essentially channels an infamous Twilight Zone episode. Depending upon how you feel about demonic children in general, your mileage may vary here, though DuVernay’s camera succeeds in balancing the creepiness (which could prove too much for some small children) with some dark humor. A Wrinkle in Time shouldn’t be viewed as the final word on DuVernay’s capabilities in taking on a $100 million movie (the first woman of color to do so, ever) or as proof that she’s better working in “reality” as opposed to fantasy. Even a filmmaker as talented as this year’s Best Director winner, Guillermo del Toro, took a couple of movies before he found his footing in the Hollywood system, and arguably some filmmakers given as many chances as Zack Snyder still haven’t. Indeed, DuVernay isn’t credited as a screenwriter—Jennifer Lee ( Frozen ) and Jeff Stockwell ( Bridge to Terabithia ) are—and so we’re left to determine who is responsible for the script’s lack of subtlety and nuance. Still, for all of Wrinkle ’s unevenness, DuVernay still manages to draw out some glimpses of more intimate beauty, the kind that one expects from the filmmaker. The most notable one comes toward the end, in an encounter between Meg and Alex that’s set against a new Sade song, written for the film. Reid’s performance is never so grounded as it is here, and DuVernay allows the scene to breathe and your tear ducts to well up. Amid the Oz-meets-Wonderland worlds we visit, I yearned for more scenes like this. They remind viewers that DuVernay’s talents aren’t gone, as the clunky screenplay might put it. They’re just enfolded.","Ava DuVernay excels at making her characters feel utterly, wholly human, even when the fully realized worlds around them threaten to swallow them.

CHRISTOPHER WEBER / AP,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The second in a string of powerful storms battered California on Saturday, bringing down trees, flooding roadways and prompting evacuations in wildfire burn areas where intense downpours could loosen bare hillsides and cause mudslides.
The system could bring 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain in some areas, 10-foot waves in the Pacific and several feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges.
A wind gust in Santa Barbara County topped 80 mph (128 kph) as the storm moved south. Wind and flash flood warnings were issued for the southern part of the state after being lifted in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Evacuations were ordered or recommended for many areas that were hit by wildfires in recent months. Authorities fear that an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain an hour could send fire debris, mud and boulders sluicing down denuded hillsides.
In Malibu, where the Woolsey fire last year destroyed many homes, residents barricaded their properties with sandbags.
In the Holy Jim fire area southeast of Los Angeles, where an August blaze scoured tens of thousands of acres in the Cleveland National Forest, volunteers using heavy equipment removed debris and deepened a creek bed to help prevent flooding.
“In the last two days we’ve been able to move 19 dump trucks worth of debris from the creek bed and reinforce some of the walls here,” Keith Kothlow of Team Rubicon, a veteran-led disaster response organization, told KABC-TV.
Santa Barbara County ordered evacuations of residents in designated debris-flow risk areas near the Thomas, Whittier and Sherpa fire scars. Nearby residents were urged to also consider leaving.
It has only been a little over a year since a downpour on the huge Thomas Fire burn scar unleashed a massive debris flow that destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes in the seaside community of Montecito. The disaster killed 21 people, and two others have never been found.
The National Park Service warned visitors to Yosemite of possible road closures and strongly advised drivers to bring tire chains in the event of snow or icy conditions.
Winter storm warnings were in place for the Sierra Nevada along with avalanche warnings on the Nevada side of the range. The Sierra is already loaded with snow from a series of storms in January. The weather service said areas could see accumulations of up to 10 feet (3 meters) over the next few days as a series of storms blew through.
Numerous areas of the state were under warnings for high winds.
The weather service lifted flash-flood watches for areas burned by the Mendocino Complex, Camp and Carr wildfires in Northern California.
Two cold weather systems will follow on Sunday and Monday, bringing additional widespread showers and snow, forecasters said.

The opening sequence has us storming an apartment complex. This demo includes copious use of the C-word. We got to this apartment a little too late for some victims. We connect to this victim to learn more about her status. She's worth a lot of money, so a private medical team airlifts her out. Your character kicks this dude out of bed the morning after the demo's opening mission. Time to get the day started. Let's open the blinds......to reveal our hometown. Different stats for different duties. Walking out of our own apartment. Convenient gym/battling center just downstairs from our pad. We'll run a job for this gentleman. He asks us to put a chip in our head to preview our upcoming mission. Getting high on his own implant-fueled supply. Shop using a UI inside of your optic nerve. New UI thanks to this dude's upgrade. Driving occurs in both first- and third-person views. The demo takes a non-combat path through this encounter. Deal's starting to go south. The virus you put into this compound fried this poor computer-attached man. Put points into various skills to hack, engineer, and otherwise get through non-combat sequences. Guide these bullets' ricochets to take out foes around corners. Another peek at the impressive ricochet UI. Your many-barreled shotgun did this to a foe's legs. New smart weapon found near the end of the compound. Aim at weak point for massive damage. At the end of the day, the Corp wins. Or does it? The upcoming video game Cyberpunk 2077 took this summer's E3 by storm with a behind-closed-doors reveal that set tongues wagging. Now, two months later, the game's developers at CD Projekt RED have deemed this hour-long gameplay slice worthy of public consumption. We've reviewed the footage, which the developer posted on Monday on its own Twitch feed and then encouraged other users to re-stream, and we can confirm both its similarities and differences to what we saw back in June. In short: differences in combat, movement, and tempo appear to indicate this is a real-time rendered demo—albeit one that adheres to a strict path. Because the demo follows an identical path, our original June report still offers a solid summary of what CDPR wants us to expect: a first-person action-RPG in which conversations and decisions drive the plot as much as sheer guns-and-gadgets combat (with a pinch of stealth and behind-corners tactics, for good measure). Electronic implants fuel a litany of on-screen UI icons, as if your character has next-gen Google Glass devices installed in their brain and eyes. Surprisingly, this reveal video mutes some of the cooler visual moments we saw in June. During our private sequence, we got a much better behind-closed-doors look at how the demo's opening gunfight destroyed an apartment's walls, while Cyberpunk 's opening town and its massive crowd of denizens are breezed through a little more quickly than what we saw. Even so, other moments in the demo take their time demonstrating how robust and interactive the city's crowds may turn out to be in the final game. The video's best quality is that it takes some mystery out of the equation and delivers what we reported earlier this summer: a demo that looks feasibly current-gen in many respects. When a given sequence features only a few non-player characters (NPCs), the level of detail, animation, and reflective neon lighting look quite attractive, though certainly doable on a standard PlayStation 4. The question is whether the game's streets, littered with apparently detailed NPCs who can be interacted with at a moment's notice, will scale in terms of memory demands on aging current-gen consoles. In the meantime, CDPR's vision of violence, choices, nudity, cursing, and faces crammed full of LEDs is now finally available for you to scrutinize and question—and we've posted a gallery above in case you want a taste before you can sit down with the full video.

Beth Mole,"reader comments 11 Plumbing the depths of women’s bladders may shower researchers with viral gold. In a wee survey, Loyola University researchers found a sac-like organ brimming with never-before-seen viruses that can kill and manipulate bacteria. Their findings, published this week in the Journal of Bacteriology, offer a first-pass catalogue of the rich diversity of bacteria-infecting viruses—aka “phages” or “bacteriophages”—in the bladder microbiome. The researchers suggest that further studies into the streaming viruses could one day lead to phage-based methods to void bacterial infections and identify disorders. “The thought that there’s not bacteria in urine is false,” Catherine Putonti told Ars straight away. Putonti, a bioinformatics researcher and microbiologist at Loyola, is the leading author of the study. “The big picture is that there are a lot of viruses that are part of these bacterial communities as well.” With an early hold on what viruses are present in the bladder, the researchers are excited for more urinary deep dives to see if there’s a core “bladder phageome” and what those viruses might be doing—or be able to do. “Now we can start asking questions,” Putonti said. Data drip Phages have long been considered potentially valuable tools for manipulating and killing bacterial populations. The viruses exclusively infect bacteria, and individual phage species typically infect and kill a narrow range of types of bacteria. Doctors in some former Soviet republics, namely Georgia, use phage to treat infections, Putonti notes. But, on the whole, researchers still don’t know enough about the viruses to use them safely and effectively, and any current treatments are considered experimental. In fact, researchers are still trying to get a handle on inventorying phage in various microbial communities—like that of the bladder. Additionally, phages can cause different types of infections, typically either lytic or lysogenic. In lytic infections, the viruses invade bacterial cells, usurp their cellular machinery to make copies of itself, then bust the cell open (lyse) so that the viruses can go forth and storm more cells. These types of phage are considered potentially useful for therapies. For instance, if a phage species invades a particular pathogen—say, a toxic E. coli species — that’s causing an infection in a patient, unleashing legions of that phage could blast the pathogen’s population and help clear the infection. In lysogenic infections, phages invade bacterial cells but then sneak their genetic code into that of the bacterium’s, sometimes disrupting genes. The bacteria then pass on their dormant, genetic stowaways to subsequent generations. In this stage, the quiet phage genes are called “prophages.” In the right conditions—say, if the bacteria are damaged, stressed, or exposed to certain conditions—prophages can awaken. When they do, they cut themselves free from the bacterial genome, start making viral clones, and burst from the cell. In other words, they switch to a lytic infection. Lysogenic phages aren’t always bad for their bacterial hosts, though. They can also be incredibly helpful because they can move around genetic code. When they break themselves free of a bacteria’s genome, they may also swipe useful code. They can then tote that code into the genome of their next host. For instance, bacteria that cause cholera, botulism, and dysentery all do so with the help of toxins encoded by prophage. Viral leak For the new bladder phage study, Putonti and colleagues at Layola focused on the more complex lysogenic phages in urine. They surveyed about 170 urine samples from women with or without urinary tract issues. The samples were collected by colleagues studying those issues in women. They collected the urine using catheters so that skin or vaginal bacteria didn’t sneak in. From the tinkle, the researchers fished out 181 bacteria spanning the diversity of microbes in the bladder and sequenced their genomes. The researchers then analyzed those bacterial genomes using a pre-existing automated tool called VirSorter. This uses probabilistic modeling and viral genetic data to scan for known and likely prophage sequences. The researchers found 457 potential phage sequences hiding in the bacterial genomes. About 86 percent of the bacterial genomes had one or more phage, and some had as many as 10 phage sequences. Of the 457 sequences, 226 were considered high-confidence sequences, and the remaining 231 were low confidence. A closer look found that most of the low-confidence hits were partial sequences or defunct prophage remnants. For the 226 high-confidence viruses, 97 were similar to prophages found before and 129 were never-before-seen virus sequences. Though it’s early to understand health implications, the researchers noted that certain Actinomycetaceae phages were only found in women with overactive bladders. Such tidbits hint that phages are playing a role in health, the authors said. Overall, just seeing things that have never been seen before is exciting, Putonti told Ars. But there’s also “a lot of exciting work that has to be done to look into the efficacy of phage as a replacement of antibiotics.” Currently, Putonti and her team are going through the individual phage to see what they do and which bacteria they can kill. Ultimately, she said, we’ll ask “can we use these phage to shape microbial communities?” Journal of Bacteriology, 2018.

Sarah Gray,"Those impacted by the California fires may face a new danger: mudslides and/or debris flows. Areas hit by the Camp Fire in Butte County and the Woolsey Fire north of Los Angeles are expecting rainfall starting on Wednesday. While that rain and could help prevent further fires — and will provide much-needed relief for the poor air quality in Northern California — it could also mean flash floods and/or mudslides. The Camp Fire The Camp Fire, which has become the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, has burned more than 151,000 acres, destroyed 17,148 structures, and left 81 dead. As of Tuesday, it was 70% contained. Now Butte County, where the fire has all but decimated the city of Paradise, is preparing for two storm systems that are predicted to hit later this week. ""Flash floods and debris flows will be a particular threat in the wildfire burn areas mentioned above,"" the National Weather Service of Sacramento reported, referring to burn areas from the Camp Fire, the Carr, Delta and Hirz wildfires in Shasta County and the Mendocino Complex Fire in Lake County. ""Heavy rainfall at times is possible over the burn areas."" ""Rainfall that would normally be absorbed will run off extremely quickly after a wildfire, as burned soil can be as water-repellent as pavement,"" according to the National Weather Service. ""The Camp Fire will likely see ash flows,"" according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen, ""and it's possible the rain could fall hard enough to create more dangerous debris flows."" The National Weather Service warned residents and emergency responders to be on the alert, as it could ""quickly become a dangerous situation."" The rain may also complicate matters for law enforcement teams searching for remains of those who may have died in the fire. There are still nearly 870 people reported missing, as of Tuesday evening. ""What we're looking at here is potentially remains, or cremains — it's kind of a cremated remains state,"" Brian Ferreira, a rescue squad officer, told CNN. ""It's going to consolidate the material and make it more dense,"" Ferreira said of the rain. ""And it's going to present much more like soil. So anything we find or hope to find that's still there, it's going to make a difficult task... that much more difficult."" Impact on the Woolsey Fire For those in Southern California impacted by the Woolsey Fire, rain is also expected. However, ""outside of any convection, peak rain rates should be well below critical thresholds for debris flows in and around burn areas,"" according to the National Weather Service. The Woolsey Fire, which is nearly contained, destroyed 1,500 structures and killed three. ""Residents near burn areas should remain vigilant but at this time the probability for any significant debris flows is very small,"" the National Weather Service said on Tuesday. Emergency officials were preparing residents for possible flooding.

Aria Bendix,"Brad Pitt's nonprofit foundation, Make It Right, started with the goal of helping New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. As the city's Lower Ninth Ward recovered from the deadly Category 5 storm in 2005, the foundation sought to satisfy its most pressing need: housing. 
 ""We went into it incredibly naive,"" Pitt told the New Orleans Times-Picayune in 2015. ""Just thinking we can build homes — how hard is that?"" 
 The project's lofty goals, like equipping the homes with sustainable building materials and energy-saving appliances, were difficult to pull off. 
 Twelve years after the start of Make It Right, residents have reported that units are rotting, collapsing, and caving in. One resident told NBC News that mold and improper ventilation in her home caused her family to come down with a slew of health issues, including respiratory infections, tremors, and memory problems.

 In September, attorney Ron Austin filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of two residents, claiming that Pitt and the foundation failed to alert homeowners of issues with the design and materials. That same month, Make It Right filed a lawsuit of its own against the project's executive architect, John Williams, and his firm. 
 The saga doesn't stop there.

The homeowners' lawsuit is now headed to federal court, with the defendants arguing that repairs could cost them $20 million. About a month after this news was announced, Pitt's lawyers petitioned to have him removed from the suit. 
 Although Pitt has reportedly left the board of Make It Right, a spokesperson for the actor said he was still coordinating with the foundation to repair homes as of September. 
 In addition to filing a lawsuit, Make It Right has undertaken its own efforts to distance itself from the damage. 
 NBC News reported that Make It Right asked some residents to sign nondisclosure agreements in exchange for repairs or settlements. The foundation has also stopped updating its website and posting to its social media accounts. 
 The foundation also hasn't filed a tax form or built a home in years, according to NBC. 
Homes in the 'Make it Right' complex showed promise when they were first constructed.

Make It Right did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment. 
 Residents have told multiple news outlets that the foundation won't return their calls. 
 Austin's lawsuit claims that Make It Right inspected homes in 2016, 2017, and 2018, but did not disclose findings to homeowners. The suit also alleges that the foundation held off on making repairs until residents signed NDAs. 
 ""Make It Right was very good at pacifying people and putting them off, and pacifying people and putting them off,"" Austin told Architectural Digest. ""They might come back and fix one thing, but not everything."" 
 In over a decade of existence, Make It Right has built more than 100 homes in New Orleans. Many of the homes are now abandoned, and at least one has been demolished due to rotting and rain damage. Other residents remain trapped in 30-year mortgages that they cannot afford to break.","Brad Pitt's ambitious housing project tried to rebuild a New Orleans neighborhood after Hurricane Katrina, but residents are now complaining that their homes are rotting, collapsing, and caving in.

John Seabrook,"The Storm Wont Come, the first track from Richard Thompsons new album, 13 Rivers, also happened to be the weather forecast for New York Harbor. Another East Coast storm would stay well south that day, making for a misty morning in the city and a low, gray sky that cast a flat light over the water. In short, it was a good day to ride the Staten Island Ferry. Larking about in the city has not been an option for Thompson until recently. He lived in Los Angeles for three decades, before moving to Montclair, New Jersey, earlier this year. At sixty-nine, he has the aquiline features and facial hair of an aging knight of King Arthurs court. Thompson underscored his West-to-East transition by driving cross-country in five days this past January. He passed through many of the places he has long known only from songs. As a songwriter, he said, while waiting for the next ferry in the terminal, its frustrating, if youre British, to look over and see how much subject matter is built into America. He added, Drove my Chevy to the levyyouve already written half a song! In composing his best-known tune, 1952, Vincent Black Lightninga kind of biker Child Balladhe said, I was thinking, What place and brand names have the same mythology to the British? His neighbor had a Vincent, a now defunct British bikemaker. Thompson had not ridden the ferry since 1970, when he was still in Fairport Convention, a seminal band in British folk rock. Les Paul, among others, taught him how to combine the drone of Scottish pipes with the complex harmonic moves on his fathers jazz records. Did you know that, according to Duke Ellington, jazz and Scottish music are the only two kinds of music with natural swing? he asked. The harbor was full of droning sounds that would feel right on Thompsons new recordmournful foghorns emerging from the mist that hid the banks and the stanchions of the Brooklyn Bridge. On Staten Island, Thompson found a diner up the hill and got some breakfast. 13 Rivers was recorded in L.A., before Thompson left the city, but it sounds as if hes ready for a change. The opening lines of The Storm Wont Come are: Im longing for a storm to blow through town And blow these sad old buildings down Fire to burn what fire may And rain to wash it all away The lyrics have the menace and the mystery of the Scottish Border poets who were on the shelf in Thompsons family home. After the third verse, which declares, There is no storm, so Ill make my own, theres a guitar solo, in which Thompsons right hand follows the Celtic patterns of traditional music, while the left hand does harmonic escape tricks. When I was growing up, my father had these great records from Earl Hinesthe jazz pianistwho was the master of skating on the edge, Thompson said. He would create inescapable musical knots for himself. How the hell is he getting out of this one? But hed always escape. Thompson gets a deep twang from his Stratocaster by grabbing hold of the strings with two fingers while keeping the pick between his thumb and the base of his index finger. It covers a lot of emotion, a deep twang, he said. Audiovisually, it can take you out to the moors of Scottish songs or up to the high lonesome of country-and-Western, as heard on Thompsons improvised soundtrack for Werner Herzogs Grizzly Man. A military-history buff, Thompson scored The Cold Blue, a new HBO film made from restored footage shot by William Wyler for a 1943 documentary about the men of the Eighth Air Force. But why Montclair? The move was prompted by a sequence of events that Thompson calls family troubles, involving the end of his marriage and the start of a new relationship on this coast. Fans know something of earlier Thompson family troubles involving Linda, his wife and partner onstage in the seventies. They continued as an act while their marriage fell apart, getting some of their best songs out of the breakup, which can be heard on their 1982 album Shoot Out the Lights. After breakfast, Thompson caught the ferry back. In terms of monuments per minute, the Staten Island Ferry may be the best twenty-five-minute boat ride in the world, but Thompson was lukewarm on the sights. He perked up, though, when a fellow-passenger mentioned that Spalding Gray is believed to have killed himself by jumping from the boat. Not to add a darker note, the passenger said. As if one were needed! Thompson declared, looking happy for the first time.",John Seabrook on the British folk-rock star’s arrival on the East Coast after three decades in Los Angeles.,2018-10-22T09:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Newyorker.com'}",Richard Thompson Rides Out a Storm on the Staten Island Ferry,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/richard-thompson-rides-out-a-storm-on-the-staten-island-ferry,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5bca65acf4dc8b77a81564f7/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/TALK-Seabrook-RichardThompson-FACEBOOK.jpg",,Newyorker.com,storm complex,1
Chris Wilson,"The 2018 hurricane season in the Atlantic, which officially kicks off June 1, is expected to be of average to above-average in intensity, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization’s annual hurricane forecast released Thursday. The NOAA scientists’ complex model predicts there will be 10 to 16 storms this year that reach wind speeds of at least 39 mph, earning them a climatological name. Of those storms, five to nine are predicted to mature into hurricanes, with winds reaching 74 mph, while one to four of those will graduate to “major” status of at least category 3 on the five-point severity scale, with wind speeds of at least 111 mph. And there’s reason to believe this is a likely possibility. A TIME examination of the past 15 years of NOAA’s forecasts found that the agency’s predictions of the number of significant storms, which are provided as high and low estimates, are usually correct or close to correct, with some major exceptions. In May of 2017, for example, NOAA predicted 11-17 named storms and 5-9 hurricanes, of which 2-4 would become major hurricanes. According to our analysis of the National Hurricane Center’s detailed database of all Atlantic storms, there were in fact 17 cyclones that reached tropical storm status, 10 of which became hurricanes and six of which were major hurricanes, including Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria. That puts the estimates off by only a small margin, breaking a three-year streak in which NOAA’s estimates in all three categories had been correct. The following visualization shows the estimates as bars from low to high predictions, mapped against dots representing the actual number of storms. Any line of dots that ends inside the bar means NOAA’s estimate was correct. Note that the green dots include all storms, while the orange dots above are the subset that became hurricanes, and the red are the subset that were major hurricanes. NOAA’s climate scientists release these estimates every May and update them later in the hurricane season. They using a cascade of data from many sources — satellite data, historical patterns, aircraft observations, ocean buoys and many others — to feed a model of ever-growing complexity. “We use all the data we can get,” says Dr. Gerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. The estimates that NOAA’s model produces are accurate about 70 percent of the time, its developers say, and are often only off by one or two storms outside the projected range. In the mythically tricky world of predicting the weather even a day in advance, this is not a bad track record. The estimates from TIME’s analysis found that 28 of the NOAA’s 45 estimates, or 62 percent, were correct, while the average error was about 3 years high or low — a figure driven up by dramatic underestimates in 2005, the year of Hurricane Katrina, and dramatic overestimates in a comparatively quiet 2006. An average hurricane season in recent years is defined as 12 named storms, six of which are hurricanes and three of which are major hurricanes. “We’ve gone a long ways to improving confidence in these seasonal outlooks,” Bell says. But he acknowledged that even 100% accuracy in predicting the number of storms and their windspeed would not obviate the need for precautions in hurricane-prone areas. “We cannot predict how many of these storms will actually make landfall,” he cautions.",A TIME analysis found that the agency's hurricane predictions are often correct,2018-05-24T19:17:28Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",The NOAA’s 2018 Hurricane Forecast Is Out.

Dominic Tarason,"My Hero One’s Justice does not have a very good name, I’ll be the first to admit, but neither did My Hero Academia, the excellent manga/anime series that this now-PC-bound superhero fighting game is based on. That shouldn’t put you off checking either out though, because superheroes knocking seven bells out of each other (and the surrounding environment) will always be fun. If you’ve somehow managed to avoid all nerd media this past year, a crash course: My Hero Academia is a massively successful teen superhero manga/anime series about a New Mutants style class of crime-fighters in training. Despite its Japanese origins, it’s a huge love-letter to the entire American superhero genre, packed with references both subtle and overt. The series mostly follows the rise of Izuku ‘Deku’ Midoriya, a non-powered kid with dreams of becoming a hero. He’s taken under the wing of All Might (a hulking great American-flag-themed celebrity superhero who’s a bit like a blend of Superman and The Tick) and quickly ends up enrolled in a prestigious hero academy. While the gameplay footage thusfar doesn’t contain much in the way of story, it seems safe to assume that it’ll roughly follow the first two seasons of the anime series, given the characters shown. What is clear is that this isn’t your usual fighting game, ala Street Fighter or the more recently relevant Dragon Ball FighterZ. Instead, My Hero One’s Justice looks a lot like the (surprisingly solid) Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm series, which put a focus on full 3D movement, positioning and the timing of a handful of easily-activated moves over learning complex combo strings. It fits the nature of the characters well, given their limited and slowly-expanding repertoire of moves. Also as in the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, you can pick two sidekick characters to back you up each fight. While not directly playable, tag-team style, you can call on them to run in and fire off a shot or combo as required. It’s probably never going to be serious esports material, but the days of TV and cartoon-licensed games being almost universally rubbish are thankfully long past, and while truly great ones are still few and far between, this one looks like a fun little romp. No date has been pinned down for My Hero One’s Justice outside of the promise of a 2018 release across all major platforms, PC included. As for the series (which is essential watching for any fan of spandex and capes), you can find it on Crunchyroll, where its third season has just started.","My Hero One’s Justice does not have a very good name, I’ll be the first to admit, but neither did My Hero Academia, the excellent manga/anime series that this now-PC-bound superhero fighting game is based on.

Jennifer Earl,"It's the moment warm weather fans have been waiting for: the first day of spring has officially arrived in the Northern Hemisphere, though some states may not believe it. A winter weather storm system is expected to creep up the Middle Atlantic and Northeast coasts Tuesday night and Wednesday, and it's bringing a lot of snow. ""Expect mixed precipitation for the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday, switching to snow on Wednesday from the Mid-Atlantic to New England,"" the National Weather Service (NWS) warned on Tuesday. The powerful storm could dump up to 18 inches of snow in some locations, marking the fourth nor'easter to smack the region in three weeks. Winter weather may still be lingering, but that hasn't stopped people across the country from celebrating what's known as the vernal equinox. Here are 5 things you should know about the annual March event. What is the vernal equinox, and why do we have it? Equinoxes occur twice a year, in March and September, to mark the onset of spring and autumn. During an equinox, which in Latin translates to ""equal night,"" both day and night are equal. ""Today the length of night and day are nearly equal,"" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said early Tuesday. ""The days will now become longer at the higher latitudes because it takes the sun longer to rise and set."" On this day, the sun crosses the celestial equator – ""the imaginary line in the sky above the Earth’s equator – from south to north,"" the National Weather Service in Jackson, Mississippi explained in a tweet. When does the equinox officially occur? The sun will be directly overhead at approximately 12:15 p.m. ET on Tuesday, according to Time and Date. Does the vernal equinox fall on the same day each year? No. The first day of spring can arrive anywhere from March 19 to March 21, depending on the year. ""Due to time zone differences, the equinox may occur a day earlier at locations that are behind UTC,"" Time and Date adds. Why? Our calendar year doesn't always have an even number of days. Every four years, an extra day, known as Leap Day, is added in the month of February. ""The March equinox would occur on the same day every year if the Earth took exactly 365 days to make a complete revolution around the Sun. But this is not the case,"" Time and Date explains. ""It takes the Earth about 365.25 days on average to go around the Sun once."" Why do people try to balance eggs on this day? An ancient myth claims an egg can balance on its end only during a vernal equinox. And every year, people gather together to attempt the challenge. ""The myth was popularized in the United States following a LIFE article in 1945, which explained the old spring adage,"" AccuWeather reports. But that myth has proven to be false. ""The vernal equinox brings no special egg-balancing properties with it,"" fact-checking website Snopes.com confirmed in a post online. ""Standing an egg on its end is something just about anyone can do any day of the year; the feat simply takes the right egg and a little trial and practice."" Why do people flock to Chichén Itzá on this day? During the equinox, people often turn to Chichén Itzá, an ancient complex constructed by Mayans located in central Mexico, to watch the sunset. They're hoping to witness a very special shadow that's cast on the structure. ""Incredibly, twice a year on the spring and autumn equinoxes, a shadow falls on the pyramid in the shape of a serpent,"" National Geographic states. ""As the sun sets, this shadowy snake descends the steps to eventually join a stone serpent head at the base of the great staircase up the pyramid’s side.""

"Matthew Warren, Nature magazine","6.6 million —that’s how many spots on the human genome Sekar Kathiresan looks at to calculate a person’s risk of developing coronary artery disease. Kathiresan has found that combinations of single DNA-letter differences from person to person in these select locations could help to predict whether someone will succumb to one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It’s anyone’s guess what the majority of those As, Cs, Ts and Gs are doing. Nevertheless, Kathiresan says, “you can stratify people into clear trajectories for heart attack, based on something you have fixed from birth”. Kathiresan, a geneticist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, isn’t alone in counting outrageously high numbers of variants. The polygenic risk scores he has developed are part of a cutting-edge approach in the hunt for the genetic contributors to common diseases. Over the past two decades, researchers have struggled to account for the heritability of conditions including heart disease, diabetes and schizophrenia. Polygenic scores add together the small—sometimes infinitesimal—contributions of tens to millions of spots on the genome, to create some of the most powerful genetic diagnostics to date. This approach has taken off thanks to a number of well-resourced cohort studies and large data repositories, such as the UK Biobank (see pages 194, 203 and 210 ), which collect vast quantities of health information alongside DNA data from hundreds of thousands of people. And some studies published in the past year or so have been able to analyse more than a million participants by combining information from such sources, increasing scientists’ ability to detect tiny effects. Supporters say that polygenic scores could be the next great stride in genomic medicine, but the approach has generated considerable debate. Some research presents ethical quandaries as to how the scores might be used: for example, in predicting academic performance. Critics also worry about how people will interpret the complex and sometimes equivocal information that emerges from the tests. And because leading biobanks lack ethnic and geographic diversity, the current crop of genetic screening tools might have predictive power only for the populations represented in the databases. “Most people are keen to have a decent debate about this, because it raises all sorts of logistical and social and ethical issues,” says Mark McCarthy, a geneticist at the University of Oxford, UK. Even so, polygenic scores are racing to the clinic and are already being offered to consumers by at least one US company. Peter Visscher, a geneticist at the University of Queensland, Australia, who pioneered the methods that underlie the trend, is broadly optimistic about the approach, but is still surprised by the speed of progress. “I’m absolutely convinced this is going to come sooner than we think,” he says. Risk calculation When researchers completed the first drafts of the human genome in the early 2000s, many expected that it would mark the start of a medical revolution. Geneticists started searching for the differences that might explain why one person develops diabetes or heart disease whereas another does not. The idea was simple: compare a group of people with the condition to a group without and look for differences in their DNA. The variations generally came in the form of DNA-letter swaps, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs. If people with a condition tended to have a T at a certain location whereas others had a C, that suggested that the SNP was associated in some way with the disease. These genome-wide association studies—or GWASs, as they came to be known—became very popular. But after years of searching, scientists could still only explain a small bit of the inherited risk for common diseases. It turned out that most of these conditions were related to many more SNPs than scientists had first expected, says Ali Torkamani, a geneticist at the Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California. Worse still, a majority of the variants conferred a very small risk—detectable only when surveying huge groups of people.“We didn’t have the sample size to really drive prediction as well as some people naively thought,” says Ewan Birney, director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK. By 2007, geneticists were fretting about something they called “ missing heritability ”. It was clear that many of these conditions had a genetic component, but GWASs clearly weren’t catching much of it. Today, things are changing. With access to massive data sets, as well as advances in how data are analysed, scientists are getting better at measuring those very small risks, says Kathiresan. A prime example is the technique Kathiresan used to generate his 6.6-million SNP score, which was published in August. He and his team took data from a 2015 meta-analysis that combined 48 GWASs, consisting of 61,000 people with coronary artery disease and 120,000 controls. They then tested their polygenic predictor on 290,000 people in the UK Biobank, finding that those scoring in the highest few percentiles had on average several times higher risk of developing the disease than did the rest of the population (see ‘The multi-gene prediction tools’). Of the 23,000 people who received the highest scores, for example, 7% had coronary artery disease, compared with 2.7% of the remaining population. The group conducted similar analyses for four other disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease and breast cancer, each time identifying a group who scored in the top few percentiles and were at particularly high risk. The paper has drawn praise from some researchers as a demonstration that polygenic risk scores could, in theory, be used in the clinic. The ability of the scores to identify high-risk groups, Kathiresan says, parallels existing measures of risk used in medicine. “Essentially what you have is a new risk factor for coronary artery disease.” Kathiresan’s work made headlines and triggered some controversy—owing to the sheer number of variants included in the risk score. Only a fraction of those 6.6 million SNPs actually contribute to the prediction, says biostatistician Nilanjan Chatterjee from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, who was not involved in the study. This is because of how these kinds of scores are calculated: data for all the variants are stuck into an algorithm, which assigns a weight to each one according to how strongly it is related to the disease, and most will in fact pose little or negligible risk. Many researchers, including Chatterjee, say that it doesn’t matter if many variants with minimal effect are included. But others worry that including millions of variants that don’t do anything could undermine public trust in the scores. Cecile Janssens, an epidemiologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, says she is not impressed by the study. One of her concerns is that the millions of variants used to calculate the final score didn’t improve performance by much compared with a score made from just 74 SNPs with the strongest links to disease. If these sorts of scores are going to be used clinically, she says, “the credibility of the score is also important.” Course of action Whereas Kathiresan’s study focused mainly on genetic risk, others are looking at how the polygenic scores might complement existing measures of risk. In 2013, Samuli Ripatti, a statistical geneticist at the University of Helsinki, found that combining a polygenic risk score with conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as high body-mass index and elevated blood pressure, improved predictions of who would develop the disease. He was also able to identify a group of people with high genetic risk scores who would otherwise have only been considered to be at intermediate risk, and Ripatti says that this ability to pick out individuals who fly under the radar is the biggest benefit of polygenic risk scores. Genetic risk scores could also improve screening regimes for diseases such as breast cancer. In the United States, women are currently advised to start getting mammograms from the age of 50, but if younger at-risk women could be identified, they might benefit from earlier screening. In 2016, Chatterjee developed a model for breast cancer that incorporated both conventional risk factors and a polygenic score calculated from around 90 SNPs. On the basis of these scores, he predicted that 16% of women aged 40 have a risk equivalent to the average 50-year-old—suggesting that they could benefit from screenings starting at 40. The team is now testing its model in other data sets and with a larger number of SNPs, to see whether the predictions hold up. Meanwhile, personalized-medicine company Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City, Utah, has already begun to include a polygenic risk score for breast cancer in the results it provides to some women. Only about 10% of women with a family history of breast cancer have one of the harmful single-gene mutations associated with the disease, so the company is now returning a score to the remaining 90% that tells them their likelihood of developing breast cancer according to a combination of polygenic risk and factors such as history and lifestyle. One of the strengths of these scores is that they provide a result for everyone, says Jerry Lanchbury, Myriad’s chief scientific officer. Although the current focus is on identifying women who are at high risk, in the future he could see the scores being used to find those who are at lower-than-average risk, who might potentially benefit from having less-frequent mammograms. “We start to enter a world where you can provide a precision-medicine result for everyone,” Lanchbury says. All in the statistics One complaint about polygenic scores is that they throw out biology in favour of statistics. Polygenic scores alone won’t provide much insight for drug development, but the studies can provide a starting point for delving into the individual variants and working out which genes they affect and the mechanisms that might lead to disease. Part of that insight will come from disentangling which variants actually produce a given trait or disease, and which are just along for the ride. A SNP that is associated with a disease isn’t necessarily its cause: it could simply be that the variant tends to be inherited alongside another part of the genome that is directly involved. For example, Kathiresan estimates that only about 6,000 of his 6.6 million SNPs are causally related to coronary artery disease. As sample sizes get larger, it becomes easier to tease these variants apart, says McCarthy. There is also still a significant portion of genetic risk that current studies can’t account for. Ripatti estimates that 30–50% of the risk for many common diseases is genetic—much of the rest is determined by environmental factors. But the problem of missing heritability remains: as a rule of thumb, GWASs can currently account for about one- to two-thirds of the inherited risk of disease, says Visscher. As sample sizes get larger, researchers will probably find more variants that contribute to the risk, says Torkamani, although the returns diminish. “At some point, you’re just going to stop getting too much utility from additional genetic risk factors,” he says. More of the genetic risk might also be picked up by whole-genome sequencing, adds Visscher. Currently, GWAS research is conducted mainly using arrays that sequence only a portion of the genome, but as whole-genome sequencing becomes cheaper and more widespread, less-common variants that contribute to disease might become easier to find. From lab to clinic Kathiresan says he hopes to have a score for coronary artery disease on the market in the next year. But most researchers acknowledge that there are obstacles to overcome before these scores can be used widely. The number one hurdle, says McCarthy, is applying them to different populations. The risk scores are generated and validated in data sets made up mainly of people with European ancestry, such as the UK Biobank, limiting the extent to which they can be applied to people of other ethnicities. Myriad’s score, for example, is currently available only to individuals with a European background, although Lanchbury says that the company is in the process of developing a similar score for African American women. McCarthy says that the ultimate aim is to generate risk scores that are specific to ethnicity. Ethnicity isn’t the only complicating factor, Birney adds. The populations analysed in the studies come from specific health-care systems, and their experiences don’t necessarily translate across countries. The chance of having a heart attack could vary between the United Kingdom and United States, for example, as could the standards of care. So scores might not be translatable. Even the simple act of communicating these scores to people brings with it a number of concerns. Doctors are not necessarily trained in genetics, says McCarthy, and “there aren’t enough genetic counsellors on the planet” to conduct the nuanced discussions that genetic risk scores will entail. There is a popular misconception that because our genetics doesn’t change, “it’s somehow a destiny that will be fulfilled”, says Birney. Janssens worries that if people think that the chance of getting a disease is hard-wired into their DNA, they won’t be motivated to do anything about it. The concern becomes even more acute for non-disease traits that might be predicted by such score s. A study on more than 1 million people published earlier this year developed a polygenic score that essentially correlates with how long people stay in education. The authors of that study went to great lengths to clarify they were not suggesting any kind of intervention for people who have extremely low scores. “Any practical response—individual or policy-level—to this or similar research would be extremely premature,” they write. Michelle Meyer, a bioethicist at Geisinger Health System and a co-author on the study says that the score simply isn’t actionable. Without understanding the biological differences represented by the score—or the environmental and social factors bound to interact with those differences—it’s impossible to know how to intervene. Talking genetics Understanding how people will react to polygenic scores is a high priority for researchers. Ripatti and his colleagues have given more than 7,000 individuals in Finland information about their likelihood of developing heart disease, based on both polygenic scores and conventional risk factors such as high blood pressure. Most of the respondents say that getting this information motivates them to make positive changes, says Ripatti. Preliminary results suggest that those with high genetic risk are the most likely to take actions such as losing weight or stopping smoking. In nearby Estonia, researchers are in the process of genotyping 100,000 individuals, adding to the 50,000 the country has already sampled. And unlike many other biobanks, participants in the Estonian project can sign up to receive feedback. Among the results being returned to them are polygenic risk scores for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, says Lili Milani, a geneticist at the Estonian Genome Center at the University of Tartu, Estonia. Similar to the Finnish work, participants are shown graphs of how lifestyle changes could reduce or increase their risk. And, says Milani, initial indications are that people are glad for the advice. For now, people are receiving their scores from genetic counsellors. But Milani is working with the Estonian government to work out how to integrate genomic data into the health-care system, so that it can be used every day by doctors. The country ultimately aims to genotype anyone who’s interested, right up to its entire population of 1.3 million, Milani says. “The goal is to build something so great that all doctors will want to recommend it and all of the population will want it.” This article is reproduced with permission and was first published on October 10, 2018.","This new approach to predictive medicine takes genomics research by storm, but still generates controversy -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com",2018-10-11T17:15:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}","Giant Leap for Gene-Based Testing Estimates Risk of Heart Disease, Breast Cancer and Others",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/giant-leap-for-gene-based-testing-estimates-risk-of-heart-disease-breast-cancer-and-others/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/FF32B102-CD6B-4D24-9DBDD3D194B56CE4.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,storm complex,1
https://business.facebook.com/NetNewsledger/,"HOUSTON – TECH – One of the most successful and enduring feats of interplanetary exploration, NASA’s Opportunity rover mission is at an end after almost 15 years exploring the surface of Mars and helping lay the groundwork for NASAs return to the Red Planet.
The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in June 2018. After more than a thousand commands to restore contact, engineers in the Space Flight Operations Facility at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made their last attempt to revive Opportunity Tuesday, to no avail. The solar-powered rover’s final communication was received June 10.
One of the most successful and enduring feats of interplanetary exploration, our @MarsRovers Opportunity is at an end after almost 15 years exploring the surface of Mars. Designed to last just 90 Martian days, here’s a look at this record-setting mission: https://t.co/erVYRlyIOmpic.twitter.com/VEY0KbLxyz
 NASA (@NASA) February 13, 2019
“It is because of trailblazing missions such as Opportunity that there will come a day when our brave astronauts walk on the surface of Mars,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “And when that day arrives, some portion of that first footprint will be owned by the men and women of Opportunity, and a little rover that defied the odds and did so much in the name of exploration.”
Designed to last just 90 Martian days and travel 1,100 yards (1,000 meters), Opportunity vastly surpassed all expectations in its endurance, scientific value and longevity. In addition to exceeding its life expectancy by 60 times, the rover traveled more than 28 miles (45 kilometers) by the time it reached its most appropriate final resting spot on Mars Perseverance Valley.
“For more than a decade, Opportunity has been an icon in the field of planetary exploration, teaching us about Mars’ ancient past as a wet, potentially habitable planet, and revealing uncharted Martian landscapes,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “Whatever loss we feel now must be tempered with the knowledge that the legacy of Opportunity continues both on the surface of Mars with the Curiosity rover and InSight lander and in the clean rooms of JPL, where the upcoming Mars 2020 rover is taking shape.”
The final transmission, sent via the 70-meter Mars Station antenna at NASA’s Goldstone Deep Space Complex in California, ended a multifaceted, eight-month recovery strategy in an attempt to compel the rover to communicate.
We have made every reasonable engineering effort to try to recover Opportunity and have determined that the likelihood of receiving a signal is far too low to continue recovery efforts,” said John Callas, manager of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project at JPL.
Opportunity landed in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars on Jan. 24, 2004, seven months after its launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Its twin rover, Spirit, landed 20 days earlier in the 103-mile-wide (166-kilometer-wide) Gusev Crater on the other side of Mars. Spirit logged almost 5 miles (8 kilometers) before its mission wrapped up in May 2011.
From the day Opportunity landed, a team of mission engineers, rover drivers and scientists on Earth collaborated to overcome challenges and get the rover from one geologic site on Mars to the next. They plotted workable avenues over rugged terrain so that the 384-pound (174-kilogram) Martian explorer could maneuver around and, at times, over rocks and boulders, climb gravel-strewn slopes as steep as 32-degrees (an off-Earth record), probe crater floors, summit hills and traverse possible dry riverbeds. Its final venture brought it to the western limb of Perseverance Valley.
“I cannot think of a more appropriate place for Opportunity to endure on the surface of Mars than one called Perseverance Valley,” said Michael Watkins, director of JPL. “The records, discoveries and sheer tenacity of this intrepid little rover is testament to the ingenuity, dedication, and perseverance of the people who built and guided her.”
More Opportunity Achievements
Set a one-day Mars driving record March 20, 2005, when it traveled 721 feet (220 meters).
Returned more than 217,000 images, including 15 360-degree color panoramas.
Exposed the surfaces of 52 rocks to reveal fresh mineral surfaces for analysis and cleared 72 additional targets with a brush to prepare them for inspection with spectrometers and a microscopic imager.
Found hematite, a mineral that forms in water, at its landing site.
Discovered strong indications at Endeavour Crater of the action of ancient water similar to the drinkable water of a pond or lake on Earth.
All of the off-roading and on-location scientific analyses were in service of the Mars Exploration Rovers primary objective: To seek out historical evidence of the Red Planet’s climate and water at sites where conditions may once have been favorable for life. Because liquid water is required for life, as we know it, Opportunity’s discoveries implied that conditions at Meridiani Planum may have been habitable for some period of time in Martian history.
“From the get-go, Opportunity delivered on our search for evidence regarding water,” said Steve Squyres, principal investigator of the rovers’ science payload at Cornell University. “And when you combine the discoveries of Opportunity and Spirit, they showed us that ancient Mars was a very different place from Mars today, which is a cold, dry, desolate world. But if you look to its ancient past, you find compelling evidence for liquid water below the surface and liquid water at the surface.”
All those accomplishments were not without the occasional extraterrestrial impediment. In 2005 alone, Opportunity lost steering to one of its front wheels, a stuck heater threatened to severely limit the rover’s available power, and a Martian sand ripple almost trapped it for good. Two years later, a two-month dust storm imperiled the rover before relenting. In 2015, Opportunity lost use of its 256-megabyte flash memory and, in 2017, it lost steering to its other front wheel.
Each time the rover faced an obstacle, Opportunity’s team on Earth found and implemented a solution that enabled the rover to bounce back. However, the massive dust storm that took shape in the summer of 2018 proved too much for history’s most senior Mars explorer.
“When I think of Opportunity, I will recall that place on Mars where our intrepid rover far exceeded everyone’s expectations,” Callas said. “But what I suppose I’ll cherish most is the impact Opportunity had on us here on Earth. It’s the accomplished exploration and phenomenal discoveries. Its the generation of young scientists and engineers who became space explorers with this mission. It’s the public that followed along with our every step. And it’s the technical legacy of the Mars Exploration Rovers, which is carried aboard Curiosity and the upcoming Mars 2020 mission. Farewell, Opportunity, and well done.”
Mars exploration continues unabated. NASA’s InSight lander, which touched down on Nov. 26, is just beginning its scientific investigations. The Curiosity rover has been exploring Gale Crater for more than six years. And, NASA’s Mars 2020 rover and the European Space Agencys ExoMars rover both will launch in July 2020, becoming the first rover missions designed to seek signs of past microbial life on the Red Planet.

Joe Ray,"Occasionally, when shredding cabbage to make sauerkraut, I wonder, of all vegetables, why this one? Don't get me wronglittle makes me happier than a late-night snack of beer, cheddar, crackers, and kraut, but the popularity of the lowly cabbage for fermenting always felt weirdly limiting. It wasn't for lack of great teachers. For the last few years, I've enjoyed working with the genius cheerleader Sandor Katz's Wild Fermentation in one hand and the bulletproof straight shooting of America's Test Kitchen's Foolproof Preserving in the other. Somehow, though, the two left me tradition bound, and I never ventured beyond sauerkraut and kimchi. I needed some uncharted territory. Flipping through The Noma Guide to Fermentation, which hits shelves this week, I came across a photo of corn on the cob being painted with a paste of fermented blueberries. It sounded like a crazy combination but Copenhagen's Noma is often ranked as the top restaurant in the world and I felt confident that it would be good. I made several ferments equipped with little more than a bunch of large Ball jars and some inexpensive specialized equipment. Once residing mostly in the domain of hippies and health-food stores, fermentation is quietly becoming the obsession of many high-end chefs. The Noma Guide is a deep dive that makes that infatuation official, describing what fermentation is, why it tastes good, and how we can learn from some incredibly capable pros about how to make our home kitchens hospitable for the good bacteria and fungi that transform our food, lending it more complex flavors. In 2014, chef René Redzepi and his team at Noma went all in and built a fermentation lab out of shipping containers, later hiring the Guide 's co-author David Zilber to run it. Now, Redzepi says, ""Fermentation isn't responsible for one specific taste at Nomait's responsible for improving everything."" He's not kidding. When Noma opened in a new location in Copenhagen earlier this year, symbolically integrating the fermentation lab, every dish on the menu featured a fermented element. Following an informative and deftly written primer to start the bookthe authors got editing and recipe testing help from food pros Chris Ying and Martha Holmbergthe Guide then divides and conquers, splitting Noma-style fermentation into several sections: lacto fermentation (salting fruits and vegetables to make the magic happen), kombucha, vinegar, koji (rice or barley inoculated with Aspergillus oryzae fungi), misos, new kinds of shoyu (soy sauce), various garums (fish sauce and friends), and non-fermented black fruits and vegetables like black garlic. Each of those sections gets its own detailed description and a raft of recipes. Redzepi and Zilber's interest in fermentation may sound simply like a good excuse for a new book, yet stretching the possible is a near necessity at Noma. Finding interesting ingredients in Denmark's winter is challenging, but transform something that's abundant in the summer into a wholly different food in the winter and you've got enough excitement to get you through the cold months. Funk House In their guide, Redzepi and Zilber encourage readers to build a fermentation chamber out of a speed rack (translation: make a temperature-controlled tent from a restaurants rolling sheet-pan rack, a little heater and humidifier, and a PID temperature controller), or make one out of a styrofoam cooler. I did none of this in my test kitchen and still made several ferments equipped with little more than a bunch of large Ball jars, and some inexpensive specialized equipment. I even did some book-sanctioned cheating, buying some rice koji, then riffing on the book's roasted koji mole recipe, which has nothing to do with a traditional mole, but it has an intense range of deep flavors similar to its namesake. It also makes a swell glaze for roasted potatoes or a lovely stand-in for hot chocolate. My partner in crime was Brian ""I belong to several fermentation groups on Facebook"" Gojdics. He's a buddy, a world-class pizza chef, andfull disclosureI've done a bit of consulting in the past for the restaurant where he is the executive chef. Together, we plowed through the prep for multiple ferments: vats of lacto-fermented blueberries, pluots, mushrooms and honey; vinegar made with pluotsthe recipe called for plums, but the pluots looked better; and coffee and mango kombuchas. ""This book's rad, it gives the why,"" Brian said. Initially, I lost Brian to the book since he was seeing it for the first time. But once he set it down, all went quickly. We had our first few jars filled in half an hour, largely because it was easy. Fermenting with salt, aka lacto fermentation, where the salt lets the good, flavor-making microorganisms do their work while inhibiting any that might be harmful, simply requires the ingredient itself, plus about two percent of its weight in salt. A kilogram of cabbage, for example, gets 20 grams of salt. Or, as Brian put it, ""You're just adding salt to a thing and putting it into a jar."" We started a pair of kombuchas, and this was where I was particularly happy to have a fermentation buddyI'd never before deployed the Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast known more commonly as a scoby. This is the rubbery disk you set floating atop a jar of sweetened black or green tea, so the microbes housed within can transform the sugars in the brew into alcohol and acetic acid. Scobys can live for months or years, and are often handed down or shared amongst kombucheers. Brian even keeps a collection of them in a big jar known as a scoby hotel, a term that makes me chuckle every time I read it. That pluot vinegar required nothing more than the fruits themselves, a little bit of liquid yeast, and some already-made unpasteurized vinegar that's added late in the game, a process dignified by another great term: backslopping. What's particularly nice about the book is that it takes the time to go into in-depth explanations. Many of its recipes have photos that illustrate what your ferment should look like over days, weeks, and even months, which is really helpful if you're worried that what you're making is going sideways. It also gives Redzepi and Zilber room to talk about their more unique creations. When they make vinegar out of celery, or miso out of peas (usually it's soybeans), they understand that we're going to need some suggestions on what to do with them. Celery vinegar, it turns out, makes an intriguing topping for fresh cheese when combined with herbs and olive oil. Miso made with with peas, or ""peaso,"" as they call it, can be folded into butter to adorn mashed potatoes, or it can be combined with garlic oil and used as a beef marinade. One particularly helpful pairing note is to simply use the fermented product with the same foods you'd pair their unfermented versions with. The ferments we made became a bit of a running project (they all are, really), and they fared better when I gave them a quick, daily once-over. Brian stopped by after about a week and made sure everything was looking good, and discovered that the lacto pluots had developed a thin layer of harmless kahm yeast. ""It won't hurt you, but the yeast itself might taste like vomit,"" he said before walking it back a little. ""OK, how about 'it can have unpleasurable flavor profiles?'"" He skimmed off the offending yeast and it was good as new. Deep Mushroom Over the course of a week or two, the flavors of each ferment developed in interesting ways. The blueberry brine went from intense sweet-salty, to a bit tart, to very pleasingly sour while their flesh became intriguingly meaty. The Noma Guide calls the brine created by lacto-fermented mushrooms a Swiss Army knife that they use to season ""everything from fennel tea to monkfish liver."" Lacking either of those, I dribbled a spoonful on a sandwich with cheddar and fresh tomatoes, which gave the whole thing a lovely, deep mushroom-y flavor. Swiss Army knife, indeed, I thought, getting similarly pleasing results when I drizzled some over a slice of reheated pizza with pesto and goat cheese. We did have one significant flop. That pluot vinegar bubbled up a storm for a couple of days, eventually giving off a pleasant banana smell with boozy notes and bubbly fruitearly-stage booze!but after about 10 days, it developed a layer of what looked like near-black fruit leather on top. I tried scraping it off, then stirring it up, but that didn't work so well, and a new layer of darkness appeared on the top in mere moments. I checked in with Brian and decided to dump it. Ya know what, though? I'd never made vinegar before, and everything else worked out pretty well. The Noma Guide preps you for the idea that not every experiment will work out every time. Besides, my wife Elisabeth, who jokingly referred to herself as a kombucha professional as she really enjoys the drink, gave my mango kombucha two thumbs up. Suddenly, taking another stab at vinegar sounded like fun! One of the things that I like most about the book is the combination of getting nerdy in the lab and handing that work off to Redzepi and his chefs who, with expert technique and refined palates, tell you what to do with what you've made. Sparkling citric koji amazake practically has amazing in its name, but I'd have no idea what to do with it. Made from rice koji, rice, and water, amazake is a sweet Japanese drink. The Noma Guide 's riff on the recipe uses barley in place of the rice, and fermenting with A. luchuensis fungi. Redzepi and Zilber suggest combining it with olive oil, garlic and shallots, then steaming clams in that mixture, reducing the liquid, and pouring it over the finished clams. Sounds good, doesn't it? Prepare to be amazed.","A new cookbook from the chefs at the famed Copenhagen restaurant explores all things pickled, cured, brined, and fermented.",2018-10-19T16:56:09Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",The Noma Guide to Fermentation: A Cure for Kitchen Boredom,https://www.wired.com/story/noma-guide-to-fermentation-book-review/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5bc8f78c91b99b2d21c6f8e0/191:100/pass/nomacookbook.jpg,wired,Wired,storm complex,1
"Cassandra Moseley, The Conversation US","The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research. Hopes for fewer large wildfires in 2018, after last year’s disastrous fire season, are rapidly disappearing across the West. Six deaths have been reported in Northern California’s Carr Fire, including two firefighters. Fires have scorched Yosemite, Yellowstone, Crater Lake, Sequoia and Grand Canyon national parks. A blaze in June forced Colorado to shut down the San Juan National Forest. So far this year, 4.6 million acres have burned nationwide – less than last year, but well above the 10-year average of 3.7 million acres at this date. These active wildfire years also mean higher firefighting costs. For my research on natural resource management and rural economic development, I work frequently with the U.S. Forest Service, which does most federal firefighting. Rising fire suppression costs over the past three decades have nearly destroyed the agency’s budget. Its overall funding has been flat for decades, while fire suppression costs have grown dramatically. Earlier this year Congress passed a “ fire funding fix ” that changes the way in which the federal government will pay for large fires during expensive fire seasons. But it doesn’t affect the factors that are making fire suppression more costly, such as climate trends and more people living in fire prone landscapes. More burn days, more fuel What is driving this trend? Many factors have come together to create a perfect storm. They include climate change, past forest and fire management practices, housing development, increased focus on community protection and the professionalization of wildfire management. Fire seasons are growing longer in the United States and worldwide. According to the Forest Service, climate change has expanded the wildfire season by an average of 78 days per year since 1970. This means agencies need to keep seasonal employees on their payrolls longer and have contractors standing by earlier and available to work later in the year. All of this adds to costs, even in low fire years. In many parts of the wildfire-prone West, decades of fire suppression combined with historic logging patterns have created small, dense forest stands that are more vulnerable to large wildfires. In fact, many areas have fire deficits – significantly less fire than we would expect given current climatic and forest conditions. Fire suppression in these areas only delays the inevitable. When fires do get away from firefighters, they are more severe because of the accumulation of small trees and brush. Protecting communities and forests In recent decades, development has pushed into areas with fire-prone ecosystems – the wildland-urban interface. In response, the Forest Service has shifted its priorities from protecting timber resources to trying to keep fire from reaching houses and other physical infrastructure. Fires near communities are fraught with political pressure and complex interactions with state and local fire and public safety agencies. They put enormous pressure on the Forest Service to do whatever is possible to suppress fires. There is considerable impetus to use air tankers and helicopters, although these resources are expensive and only effective in a limited number of circumstances. As it started to prioritize protecting communities in the late 1980s, the Forest Service also ended its policy of fully suppressing all wildfires. Now fires are managed using a multiplicity of objectives and tactics, ranging from full suppression to allowing fires to grow larger so long as they stay within desired ranges. This shift requires more and better-trained personnel and more interagency coordination. It also means letting some fires grow bigger, which requires personnel to monitor the blazes even when they stay within acceptable limits. Moving away from full suppression and increasing prescribed fire is controversial, but many scientists believe it will produce long-term ecological, public safety and financial benefits. Professionalizing wildfire response As fire seasons lengthened and staffing for the national forest system declined, the Forest Service was less and less able to use national forest employees as a militia whose regular jobs could be set aside for brief periods for firefighting. Instead, it started to hire staff dedicated exclusively to wildfire management and use private-sector contractors for fire suppression. There is little research on the costs of this transition, but hiring more dedicated professional fire staffers and a large contractor pool is probably more expensive than the Forest Service’s earlier model. However, as the agency’s workforce shrank by 20,000 between 1980 and the early 2010s and fire seasons expanded, it had little choice but to transform its fire organization. Baked-in fire risks Many of these drivers are beyond the Forest Service’s control. Climate change, the fire deficit on many western lands and development in the wildland-urban interface ensure that the potential for major fires is baked into the system for decades to come. There are some options for reducing risks and managing costs. Public land managers and forest landowners may be able to influence fire behavior in certain settings with techniques such as hazardous fuels reduction and prescribed fire. But these strategies will further increase costs in the short and medium term. Another cost-saving strategy would be to rethink how firefighters use expensive resources such as airplanes and helicopters. But it will require political courage for the Forest Service to not use expensive resources on high-profile wildfires when they may not be effective. Even if these approaches work, they will likely only slow the rate of increase in costs. Wildfire fighting costs now consume more than half of the agency’s budget. This is a problem because it reduces funds for national forest management, research and development, and support for state and private forestry. Over the long term, these are the very activities that are needed to address the growing problem of wildfire. This is an updated version of an article originally published July 25, 2018.

PTI,"WASHINGTON: The record-breaking 15-year-long Mars mission of NASA's Opportunity rover was declared over after the US space agency failed to contact the robotic explorer for over eight months.
The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in June last year.
After more than a thousand commands to restore contact, engineers in the Space Flight Operations Facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made their last attempt to revive Opportunity Tuesday, to no avail.

Eleanor Gibson,"New York architecture studio DFA has imagined a series of latticed apartment towers for Manhattan's Pier 40, which would be able to remain above water in the event of rising sea levels. DFA 's conceptual proposal involves constructing a complex of housing, recreational and commercial facilities on the square-shaped Pier 40. The structure extends 250 metres over the Hudson River and currently houses car parking facilities and a popular football field. By adapting the existing pier – which was built in 1962 and fallen into disrepair – the architecture studio is offering several responses to current issues in New York City, including a lack of affordable housing and resiliency to flooding due to climate change. ""We see so many projects going up in New York that are quick, chart-driven responses to serious problems,"" said DFA founding principle Laith Sayigh. ""These short-term resolutions will not safeguard the city from rapid changes in the environment or protect future generations of people."" The concept envisions 19 cylindrical high-rises, wrapped in golden net-shaped window frames and planting. These would house a total of 450 living units, which would be sold at price points from affordable to luxury. Ranging from 96 to 455 feet (29 to 138 metres) tall, the towers would be set in 11 clusters that the architecture firm based on analysis of the pier's structural base – comprising thousands of steel H-pile girders reinforced with concrete and sunk into the river. The residences in the towers would be elevated 60 inches (1.5 metres) above expected storm surge levels as one of a series of ways to protect the complex from flooding caused by sea-level rise. An elevated undulating pathway would wrap around the bases of the clusters, over a series of public pavilions. These would remain open until 2050, when water levels are expected to increase between 11 and 30 inches (30 and 76 centimetres).

Whether you’re a solo freelancer or leading a startup with several employees, there’s one thing you’ll definitely need to protect your business and yourself at some point: an enforceable contract.
Many beginning business owners (and more than a few experienced ones, too) view the contract as a hassle and a waste of time. Some might even think that a written agreement is the equivalent of “anticipating trouble.”
When properly drafted though, contracts do not create problems -- they solve them. And while many entrepreneurs believe their clients would react negatively to it, contracts are commonly encountered in most industries because written agreements are essential for a good working relationship with providers, vendors, partners and clients or customers.
Let’s look at how they help your business succeed and protect the interests of both parties.
Related: 3 Easy Ways to Royally Muck Up Your Freelance Contracts
1. They remove doubt and provide certainty. 
A well-drafted contract will specify each party’s expectations. It helps both parties focus on their business relationship instead of anticipating problems or trying to sort out open-ended questions.
To understand this, think about your biggest client or customer, preferably one that does regular business with your company. How many different aspects of your transactions with this person or business could you identify?
Let’s say you sell paper, and this client is a law firm. What size paper do they need? How much of it per month are you required to deliver? What price are they obligated to pay, and when?
The paper transaction is a pretty simple one example. Most business deals are more complicated, and as a result, present many more opportunities for uncertainty. Written contracts help remove the uncertainty inherent in those complex transactions and help both parties make more effective and reliable plans.
2. Contracts outline obligations and remedies. 
In a related vein, uncertainty can cost you quite a bit of time, effort and money if you or your client are unclear about your obligations in any way. Quantities, prices per unit, delivery costs and who pays them are just a few examples of some terms you should take care to spell out in writing.
In addition, it’s important to outline remedies in case one party breaches the agreement. In some jurisdictions, even if you win a case for breach of contract, you can’t recoup the costs of that case (for example, attorney’s fees) unless you specify them in a written contract.

3. They provide procedures for thorny disputes. 
What happens if there is a disagreement between you and your client?
You don’t have to proceed directly to court. Certainly, litigation is prudent (possibly even required) in some situations. However, a lawsuit isn’t a very effective way of resolving business disputes. Business litigation can be very expensive and take a long time to reach a final conclusion, thanks to appellate procedures.
A contract can specify an alternative means of resolving your dispute, such as mediation or arbitration. Many parties in business disputes find these methods preferable to filing a lawsuit. However, unless you both agree to pursue these methods first, there’s usually no obligation for the other party to participate. (Some states do require parties to some cases to pursue alternative dispute resolution methods before being able to file a lawsuit.)
4. Contracts help you end relationships cleanly. 
Without some means and provisions for canceling or terminating a contract, the end of a business relationship can create obstacles that can’t be resolved through clear communication.
When the buyer for your goods or services suddenly cancels the deal, it can cause many problems. Chief among those problems is the interruption in anticipated cash flow. A termination clause can help you by requiring the buyer to give you advance notice of some amount of time (a month is common). That notice gives you time to find additional buyers or clients to replace the lost revenue.

5. They address the unforeseen.
A commonly included clause in business contracts is called “force majeure” or the “act of God” provision. This clause or section of a contract essentially sets out the parties’ obligations and rights in the event of an unforeseeable event, such as a natural disaster, or any other circumstances beyond their control that make it unreasonably difficult to perform under the contract.
Let’s say you’re obligated to provide 20 crates of imported tea, but the shipping container gets blown overboard during a storm. With a force majeure clause, you won’t be deemed in breach of the contract, even though technically you failed to perform your obligations.
If you’re new to contracts, it’s best to hire an attorney with transactional experience in your industry to create a contract for your company. You can present this contract to future partners and clients, although they may request changes to the document. Be careful in reviewing and accepting those requested changes, as contract law can be quite complex and outcomes may depend on even slight changes in wording.","Contracts are not a substitute for trust, they are the basis for trust.",2019-01-22T12:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",5 Ways Contracts Are an Entrepreneur's Best Friend,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/326645,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20190121195742-GettyImages-912978286.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,storm complex,1
Zoë Schlanger,"Houston is home to the largest petrochemical complex in the US. Often nestled within residential neighborhoods, chemical plants, oil refineries, and the myriad businesses that support them often operate with little oversight. Now one, Wright Containers—a company that deals in used industrial plastic containers meant to hold 330 gallons of hazardous liquid at a time—is facing felony charges that could land its managers in prison for 10 years. Prosecutors say they hope the case will spark a new era of making companies accountable for environmental crimes in a city where that’s unusual, the Houston Chronicle reports. Wright Containers is accused of instructing employees to dump the residual toxic chemicals they routinely handled down a storm drain. The company stacked their large plastic containers, known as “totes,” around the storm drain to conceal it from public view, prosecutors said. It went unnoticed for months. But employees who were injured by exposure to the chemicals became whistleblowers, alerting authorities. The site is a half-mile from an elementary school, three-quarters of a mile from a second elementary school, and a mile from a junior high. The Chronicle notes that it is also in close proximity to hundreds of homes. When police showed up, they smelled noxious fumes and “felt more nauseous the closer they got to the drain,” Alex Forrest, chief of the environmental crimes division of the Harris County District Attorney’s Office, told the Chronicle. “Some of the chemicals would burn the skin off your bones,” he said. On Feb. 2, the company was indicted on felony charges in a county court. The Chronicle called the indictment “rare” in a city in which “materials facilities have been allowed to flourish in the city’s unzoned sprawl,” where “catching chemical waste dumpers — or merely getting an inventory of all the haz-mat sites around town — has proven difficult for the Houston Fire Department.” The chemicals dumped included benzene—which causes cancer in humans—along with dichloromethane, ethylbenzene and toluene, which are all either respiratory irritants, hormone disruptors, or probable carcinogens. The storm drain was connected to Simms Bayou, which flows into Galveston Bay. Houston is notorious for its many toxic, federal Superfund sites, oil refineries, and industrial complexes, many of which are clustered near Latino or low-income neighborhoods. Those neighborhoods were in the spotlight when Hurricane Harvey hit, flooding waste sites and causing refineries to far exceed their permitted air pollution limits, releasing millions of pounds of pollutants into the air and water. And those communities have long faced “more exposure to air toxics than almost anywhere in the country,” according to Daniel Cohan, associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University, who specializes in air pollution. “We know that we have elevated levels of cancers all along these areas. There have been many reports to show increased rates of childhood leukemia if you live within two miles of the Houston ship channel, for example,” Juan Parras, the director of the grassroots environmental justice group TEJAS, said in an interview with Democracy Now. In a 2016 investigation, the Chronicle found significant gaps in regulation of polluting industries: It reported that “less than a quarter of hazardous materials facilities with permits had been inspected, and little effort was being made to find ones skirting the rules.”","Houston is home to the largest petrochemical complex in the US.

Celu Ramasamy,"October 12, 2018 5 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. In 2017, Toyota offered us a glimpse into their version of the future where surprisingly, driving is still fun. Concept-i is the star in the autonomous future where people are still driving. And in the case of Toyota, it's so much fun because they're cruising along with their buddy Yui, an AI personality that helps them navigate, communicate and even contributes in their discussions. Yui is all over the car, controlling every function and even taking the wheel when required to. It's definitely an exciting future where the machine sounds and “feels” like a human, even exhibiting empathetic behavior. Related: Preparing for the Future of AI That's the kind of future I'd imagine awaits user experience (UX) in the world of AI. A time when the human-AI connection is so deep that some experts say there will be “no interface.” But currently, UX does depend on an interface. It requires screens, for instance, and they don't do much justice to it. Integrating AI into the process will mean better experience all around. From websites to homes and cars, here's how AI could help patch the holes and bring UX closer to maximum potential. 1. Complex data analysis. Until now, to improve user engagement in their products, UX teams have turned to tools and metrics such as usability tests, A/B tests, heat maps and usage data. However, these methods are soon to be eclipsed by AI. It's not so much because AI can collect more data -- it's how much you can do with it. Using AI, an ecommerce store can track user behavior across various platforms to provide the owner with tips on how they can improve their purchasing experience, eventually leading to more sales. AI can be used to tailor the design to each user’s specifications, based on the analysis of the collected data. All this is achieved through the application of deep learning that combines large data sets to make inferences. Additionally, these systems can learn from the data and adjust their behavior accordingly, in real time. Thus, designers applying AI in their work are likely to create better UIs at a faster rate. Related: Using Artificial Intelligence in Sales Saves Time and Reveals New Opportunities 2. Deeper human connection. By analyzing the vast amount of data collected, AI systems can create a deeper connection with humans, enhancing their relationship. This is already happening in a couple of industries. When you think of Siri, you see a friendly-voiced (digital) personal assistant. When Amazon first introduced Alexa, it took the market by storm. But its usefulness could only be proven over time. And it was. Smart-home owners are using it to do a million things, including scouring the internet for recipes, schedule meetings and shop. It's also being used in ambulances. Even Netflix’s highly predictive algorithm is a case example of AI in use. Toyota says Concept-i isn't just a car, but a partner. From the simulation video, you can see that Yui connects with the family on a level that current UX doesn't reach. By using the function over and over, consumers end up establishing an interdependent relationship with the system. That's exactly how AI is designed to work. You use the system; it collects data; it uses it to learn; it becomes more useful; gives better user experience; you use it more as it collects data, learns and becomes more useful; and the cycle continues. You don't even see it coming -- and before you know it, you're deeply connected. 3. More control by the user. A common concern about the adoption of AI to everyday life is whether the machines might eventually rise and take over the world. In other words, users are concerned about losing control over the systems. It's a legitimate concern with the autonomous cars, robots guards and smart homes expected to become commonplace. This lack of control is mirrored in the skepticism for the future, but it can also be seen in commerce and other areas where user experience is of great importance. For instance, a user will be more likely to enter their card information into a system if they feel they have control over when money is transferred, to whom it goes and that they can retrieve it in case something goes wrong. As AI develops, users will gain more control over the system, gradually improving trust which will lead to more usage. Related: 3 Ways in Which AI Could Enhance Your Company's UX UX design is about a designer trying to communicate a machine's model to the user. Meaning, the designer is trying to show the user how the machine works and the kind of benefits they can get from it, from the former's point of view. Traditionally, this involved following certain rules, and designers understood them very well. A designer knows how to create a web page by following certain rules that they can probably manipulate. With AI, however, the design is dependent on a complex analysis of data instead of following sets of rules. To be able to design using AI, designers will have to really understand the technology behind it.","Designers using AI create better user interfaces, faster.",2018-10-12T13:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",How Artificial Intelligence Could Help You Design a Better User Experience,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/320675,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20181010195904-GettyImages-968680670.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,storm complex,1
Beth Elderkin,"The Incredibles 2 sees the return of iconic “supers” like Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, along with some new ones. But let’s not forget that Disney Pixar’s first venture into the superhero genre resulted in one of Pixar’s highest body counts. Twenty supers died to make this movie. But even though they were barely onscreen—at least not alive—many of them had surprisingly complex stories. And we’re going to tell you all about them. In The Incredibles, everything we know about supers (and life before the Superhero Relocation Program) is secondhand information, stories shared by Bob Parr and Lucius as they wait near a police scanner, or words of caution from a fashion designer who hates capes. But Disney gave the world of Incredibles ’ supers a surprising amount of development. Not only were there comic books, but The Incredibles DVD featured a number of biographies about the never-seen characters. Some of the bios included audio interviews, but after reading about them, you may wonder how some were considered superheroes in the first place. Before supers went into hiding, there were three main superhero groups registered through the National Supers Agency, or NSA, along with some other temporary alliances and team-ups. The most controversial group was the Thrilling Three, led by the famous Gazerbeam. They disbanded after tons of infighting, mostly caused by Gazerbeam being an egotistical douchebag. However, not every superhero was part of a team—as Mr. Incredible lovingly put it during the first film, he worked alone. Among the other “freelancers” included an alcoholic, a woman who used her powers to steal boyfriends, and a potential supervillain who said supers were the “superior race.” Yikes. Killed by Syndrome’s Omnidroid Robot These are the heroes who Syndrome lured to his island in order to have them test out his Omnidroid robot, much like he did with Mr. Incredible. It’s really sad to think that he brought them all there under false pretenses solely so he could kill them. All they wanted was to be supers again, dammit! Apogee A former (and very disgruntled) member of the Thrilling Three, Apogee had solar powers. She could control gravity when the sun was out, with her powers growing around high noon, and she could fly thanks to solar-powered levitation. But her powers only worked in the daytime. “It makes me look like an idiot if something happens at night,” she said during an NSA recording. “Unless evil breaks out at a tanning salon, I’m done for.” Blazestone Blazestone was pyrokinetic. She could shoot fire from her hands and control heat, giving her the ability to fly. But her hot-headedness wasn’t limited to her powers. She spoke incredibly fast sometimes (based on which dimension she was in), and had a nasty temper. And she really didn’t like having to work with a team—though the NSA put her in Beta Force anyway. “They always have to keep an eye on me. I don’t know why. I only light a couple things on fire that I shouldn’t light on fire,” Blazestone said. “I mean, when I think about things that anger me just a little bit, then, you know, boom! The building lights on fire. And next thing you know the hills light on fire.” Blazestone had a temporary partnership with Frozone, and it’s implied that they were in a relationship at some point. Even though she didn’t seem to like him much, this tidbit adds an extra tragedy to The Incredibles ; as worded by the Disney Wiki, Mr. Incredible would’ve had to tell Frozone that his former partner (and possibly lover) had died. Blitzerman He wasn’t given an NSA file, sadly, so the only thing we have to go on is the brief flash we see during the death montage. According to the Disney Wiki, his character description may read “super powered locomotion,” meaning he could speed up really quickly. Downburst This guy was kind of a sad sack. Downburst had the ability to manipulate matter—but only to heal “a cut or a boo-boo,” as he liked to put it. He started out at a doctor’s office but then got bored, so he moved to superhero work... where the NSA had him practice making bicycles. Downburst had a crush on Blazestone, and seemingly resented Frozone because of their possible relationship. According to his interview, supers had their own fan conventions. Everseer Everseer was the telepathic leader of Phatasmics with a separate power he called “magnoscopic vision,” meaning both microscopic and telescopic. As a result, he could basically see everything down to its cells and was a major germophobe. In his private life, he was a therapist and author of books like Shut Up! Quieting Your Inner Voice. He also claimed to be able to see the future, something other supers didn’t take seriously. But the joke was on them. According to a Boom Studios comic book series, Everseer foresaw his death and left instructions to have a packet delivered to Bob Parr 10 years after he died. And that wasn’t the end of his story. Apparently, his brain had been lobotomized and preserved so that supervillain Xerek (the original villain from The Incredibles movie) could use his clairvoyance as a weapon. The comic was canceled shortly after, so we never found out what happened to his brain. Gamma Jack If this guy hadn’t been killed before the events of the first movie, he probably would’ve become the NSA’s first hero-turned-supervillain. Previously known as “Handsome Jack,” Gamma Jack produced controlled radiation bursts and did not give a shit how much collateral damage he caused as a result. He tended to pick and choose which mission he took on based on which ones had beautiful women that needed to be saved. Then, there was his whole obsession with female villains. It’s kinda creepy. “The real kicker is I get these dames, man, these dame villains and they’ve got the curves and the hair and the big eyes. And boy, those ones are really hard to kill,” Gamma Jack said. “You’ve really got to take a jog around the block real quick to get your concentration back.” There’s also a note in his NSA file about how he believes supers are “a superior race,” which goes right up there with “pureblood” as a totally evil thing to say or think. Gross. Gazerbeam This is the only super whose body we actually see in the film. He was found by Mr. Incredible after fleeing Syndrome and had scrawled the password “KRONOS” into the cave wall with his laser vision. In the “real world,” Simon Paladino was a pro bono lawyer who also attended Bob and Helen’s wedding. He also spent years trying to get the supers ban repealed before his death. Gazerbeam he was also a total asshole and his colleagues in the Thrilling Three hated him. Case in point: Their official team vehicle was a motorcycle with two side cars. Guess who rode the motorcycle. Hypershock All we know about this super was that he was an angry alcoholic who created earthquakes with his fists. Macroburst They had the power to generate “high-velocity wind,” which gave them the ability to fly. They had served as Everseer’s sidekick before becoming a full-fledged member of Phantasmics (mostly serving as group transportation). The NSA was uncertain of the super’s gender identity, saying the constant wind on their hair made them look “oddly androgynous.” Phylange This guy could create sonic waves with his voice—well, except when he had laryngitis, which seemed to happen a lot. He was a member of the Thrilling Three but quit because Gazerbeam was a jerk, though he later swears the two of them were totally cool. According to the NSA, he “demands respect he doesn’t earn” and was never embraced by the public. At least he had a side gig as an opera singer... when he didn’t have laryngitis. Psycwave She was a former therapist with Everseer, but quit because she got pissed that people couldn’t solve their own problems. This was likely related to her superpower, which was the ability to psychically possess other people and make them do anything she wanted. In an NSA recording, she admitted that she mostly used it to steal boyfriends. “I had a crush on the quarterback of the [high school] football team, who was also my best friend’s boyfriend. I psych-waved him into asking me to the homecoming dance and breaking up with Shelly,” she said. “I never really used it to harm people—except for all those girls I made the guys break up with because I wanted to date them.” Stormicide A brilliant graduate student in chemistry who had the ability to absorb and emit different gases and vapors, like oxygen or carbon monoxide. “Because I’m all about gas emissions—yes, I have been the butt of many jokes,” she said. Tradewind Nothing is known about him other than he could control the elements. Universal Man This guy was kind of hilarious. He had a unique view of himself and his gifts of being able to change molecular density and make black holes. While many of the other superheroes strove to separate their normal and superhero lives, Universal Man had no alter ego. He saw himself as only a super. In an NSA recording, he described going on dates with women, getting to the point where they’d be in a private situation with her wanting to take off his mask. He’d refuse: “There’s no one underneath! They would be horrified if I asked them to take off their face!” Vectress She could make sub-sonic bursts. No other information is available. Killed by ‘Suit Malfunction,’ aka Capes My coworker James Whitbrook may call Edna Mode’s “no capes” claims blasphemy, but in The Incredibles a lot of superhero deaths are blamed on them. Those deaths may carry a different weight than the ones set up by a little boy in order to make his fake killer robot a better killer, but they’re still pretty gnarly. Especially because we actually see these deaths happen—at least in Edna’s flashbacks. “No capes!” Dynaguy Dynaguy was one of the first supers to get sued for public endangerment after Mr. Incredible. He had a disintegration ray and could fly thanks to some ion-powered gauntlets, so naturally, he caused a lot of collateral damage. He attended Bob and Helen’s wedding, only to later die after his cape snagged on the ground during one of his takeoffs. Gazerbeam took over as leader of the Thrilling Three after his death. I do want to give a shout-out to his NSA interview—it only reveals how he came up with his name, but it’s really funny. One day, I’m having lunch in the local diner and I’m really desperate. I haven’t thought of a name yet. So i’m just looking around. Fork Man, didn’t work. How about Spoon Dude? Banana Cream Pie Throwing Man....I saw the placemat, it’s Ralph’s Diner. Maybe Diner Guy? No. If my name’s Diner Guy, I’m only protecting the diner. When people come in, I defend the diner. I didn’t want to restrict myself to that. I keep thinking diner, diner, Dynaguy. That kind of fit together. Meta Man Not a lot is known about this guy, since his NSA audio file was “confiscated during surprise attack by Baron Von Ruthless” (aka the “monologue guy” Bob and Lucius make fun of during the movie). But he was basically their version of Superman. He had the powers of, like, five gods. Flight, super strength, X-ray vision, sonic scream, teleportation, magnetic manipulation, partial invisible, and the ability to talk with marine animals. He was being considered to oversee all the NSA’s superhero teams, before getting his cape caught in an elevator. Splashdown Like Meta Man, Splashdown could communicate with marine creatures, along with being able to swim really fast and breathe underwater. By day, he was an oceanographer who was obsessed with finding the Lost City of Atlantis. He too was at Bob and Helen’s wedding and died when his cape was caught in a storm vortex. Stratogale A teenager the NSA didn’t seem to like very much. She could fly, was super strong, and could communicate with birds. She was also at Bob and Helen’s wedding. Her death was by far the nastiest, as we see her get caught in a jet turbine. Thunderhead Thunderhead also went to Bob and Helen’s wedding and was great with kids. He was the single father of five adopted children and, according to the NSA file, he raised them with his “roommate” Scott (come on, guys). Thunderhead had storm powers and could control the weather, but wasn’t the smartest tool in the shed. He died when his cape caught on a rocket. There were a couple of other supers mentioned in the film who didn’t die at the hands of Syndrome or their own capes, but for the most part, The Incredibles is a graveyard of heroic corpses. It’s unclear whether the next film will continue or even increase the predecessor’s high body count, but I can’t imagine it’ll be as bad as Finding Nemo. That’s right: 350 fishies died during that one.","The Incredibles 2 sees the return of iconic “supers” like Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, along with some new ones.

Gathering Storm will also add eight more civs and nine more leaders, along with seven new wonders, and lots of buildings, districts, and so on. Environmental effects include volcanoes, storms like blizzards and hurricanes, climate change, floods, and droughts. Your strategic resources will be consumed in power plants to produce electricity, but as time passes you can turn from a coal- and oil-based energy to renewable energy sources. Your choices regarding renewable energy can also have an effect on world temperature, melting ice caps, and rising sea levels. You'll have new tools to deal with these global threats, with developments like canals, dams, tunnels, and railroads to overcome obstacles in your land. As your civilization evolves you can start to develop cities that are more protected thanks to flood barriers, expanding your build areas. You can also form alliances, influence city states, and compete in world games with the world congress. You'll be able to call a special session to address emergencies, vote on resolutions, and use diplomatic favor to negotiate promises from world leaders. A new era will also be added to the Technology and Civics trees to deal directly with the environmental effects. The nine new leaders will each bring their own bonuses and nine new units, four new buildings, three improvements, two districts, and one unique governor. Those join the seven new world wonders and seven natural wonders, 18 new units, 15 improvements, 9 new buildings, 5 new districts, 2 new city sets, 9 new techs, and 10 new civics. Finally, Gathering Storm will add two more scenarios. The Black Death will put you in the middle of the pandemic that ravaged Europe and western Asia and task you with keeping your people alive. The other, War Machine, is a multiplayer scenario putting you in the role of Germany or France at the outset of World War 1, in the midst of the invasion of Belgium. These will come alongside several new changes to the Espionage system, updates to Culture and Science victories, and new Historic Moments. These all appear primed to add several new layers of strategy to an already complex and enrapturing game. ""Civ 6 has a few rough edges, but theyre pushed far into the periphery by spectacular strategic depth and intricate interlocking nuances,"" said critic Scott Butterworth in GameSpot's Civilization 6 review.

Nick Carey,"WYOMING, Mich. (Reuters) - Bob Roth makes no bones about his feelings towards U.S. manufacturing. 
The co-owner and chief executive of RoMan Manufacturing Inc, which makes transformers and glass-molding equipment for automakers and other industries, asks callers on his voicemail: “What have you done today to support U.S. manufacturing?” 
His procurement team has been under long-standing orders to source all parts and materials as near as possible to his western Michigan factory, even with President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum. 
But with those tariffs dragging into a new year and steel comprising a quarter of RoMan’s fixed costs, Roth says his company has now begun the lengthy process of switching from its U.S. suppliers to an Israeli company for a key component for its products. 
It is a strategic decision that RoMan and other auto suppliers have put off since the tariffs kicked in last spring. With tariffs firmly part of the landscape, some are now starting to shift their own supply chain to keep costs in check, according to more than a dozen interviews with U.S. auto suppliers and industry consultants. (U.S. jobs impact of metal tariffs: tmsnrt.rs/2RKvA83) 
The choice is stark for most suppliers: absorb the extra cost, pass them on to customers or find ways to slash material costs. 
The transformers Roth’s 150 workers at RoMan produce require a magnetized steel core that is now more expensive as tariffs have allowed U.S. steel producers to raise prices. The Israeli supplier has access to cheaper steel and its cores qualify as finished products, so they are not subject to tariffs - making them a cheaper alternative. 
“We don’t have the money to buy our way out problems like this,” Roth said of RoMan, which has annual revenue of around $35 million. “In the long run we can’t afford to absorb the extra cost of tariffs.” 
Roth says he appreciates the sentiment behind Trump’s push to bring back American manufacturers jobs, but adds tariffs are “the wrong tool” because they hurt U.S. firms. 
Trade consulting firm Trade Partnership Worldwide LLC estimated last summer metals tariffs could cost 5,000 jobs in the U.S. auto industry and 400,000 jobs overall - 16 jobs lost for every steel or aluminum worker hired. But so far there is little data available on how tariffs affect businesses such as RoMan because the process of switching suppliers is a long one and many manufacturers have muddled through so far. 
For agraphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2RKvA83
Steven Wybo, a managing director at consultancy Conway MacKenzie, said “every single auto supplier we are working with has concerns around tariffs,” and he worries they come at an already challenging time for the sector. 
Suppliers are gearing up for a large number of vehicle launches over the next three years, an expensive business, while also bracing for an expected decline in U.S. new vehicle sales. And some in the sector will bear the brunt of restructuring at Ford Motor Co (F.N) General Motors Co (GM.N), which are dropping less-popular sedan models. 
Adding tariffs to the mix can require a creative approach.   
RoMan, for instance, splits half of a 10 percent tariff with a Chinese customer on transformers subject to retaliatory measures against U.S. manufacturers. RoMan will raise some prices 2 percent this month to partially offset rising copper prices. 
Warren, Michigan-based Eckhart Inc - which books about $100 million in annual sales by building robots and automated tools for GM, Volvo and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and other automakers - must absorb the tariffs or run the risk of losing out in competitive bids. 
So Eckhart has focused on cutting costs, including rolling out a new U.S. purchasing system for raw materials, CEO Andrew Storm said. 
“We have to fight for every single dollar of revenue that comes in the door,” Storm said. “So we find ways to eat the extra cost.” 
That is why RoMan is seeking alternative suppliers to cut costs - and it takes a long time to ensure a new supplier is financially sound and can consistently hit industry standards. Months into that process, RoMan is only now validating test parts produced by its potential new Israeli supplier. 
“You can’t turn your supply chain on a dime,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research (CAR). 
Dziczek said she gets calls “all the time” from suppliers wondering whether to overhaul their supply chain, and yet worrying that if they do, Trump may reverse policy overnight. 
LOSING BUSINESS 
The issue stretches up and down the supply chain for cars. Ford and GM have already warned metals tariffs will cost them $1 billion each in profits, setting in motion a complex dance over who foots the bill. 
If automakers have to cover the cost, they typically raise vehicle prices to pass it onto consumers. Just this week, a Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) executive said industry wide tariffs have increased the average U.S. vehicle price by around $600. 
Peter Bible, chief risk officer at tax advisory firm EisnerAmper and former chief accounting officer at GM, said suppliers making parts for less-popular vehicles will have trouble passing on higher costs. Automakers will resist price increases, but will be also be wary of pushing suppliers too hard, Bible said. 
Problems at a single supplier can be disastrous, as Ford discovered last May when a fire at a supplier halted production of some highly-profitable pickup trucks. 
Some suppliers have adapted quickly to cut costs. 
They have cost Gentherm Inc (THRM.O), which makes climate control systems for vehicles and had revenue of close to $1 billion in 2017, a “few million” dollars, according to CEO Phil Eyler. 
“We’ve worked really fast to change supplier locations in a couple cases,” he said. 
Mark Wakefield, a managing director at consultancy AlixPartners, said suppliers providing more commoditized parts will find adjusting harder. 
That’s the case for Grand Rapids, Michigan-based Pridgeon &amp; Clay, which supplies stamped steel and stainless steel parts to automakers, with annual revenue of more than $350 million. 
Third-generation owner Kevin Clay has lost business to low-cost overseas competitors in India who use cheaper tariff-free steel, and whose finished products are not subject to Trump’s U.S. tariffs. 
Metal tariffs have shaved 25 percent off Clay’s pre-tax profit. Banks still wary of his sector following the Great Recession are growing reluctant to issue loans, and his company has mothballed some spending plans and cut staff more than usual for this time of year, according to Clay. 
“These tariffs have cost me business,” said Clay, who describes himself as a moderate conservative who fervently believes in free trade. “If the aim is to get to a tariff-free world, this is a crappy way to get there.”

KEVIN ROOSE and CECILIA KANG,"Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, zeroed in on the central issue of the hearing, asking Mr. Zuckerberg whether he would be comfortable sharing aloud the name of the hotel he stayed in on Monday night, or whether he would be comfortable sharing the names of the people he has messaged this week. Photo Cardboard cutouts of Mr. Zuckerberg were set up outside the Capitol on Tuesday by Avaaz, a global advocacy group. “We have made a lot of mistakes in running the company,” Mr. Zuckerberg testified. Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times “No. I would probably not choose to do that publicly here,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “I think that may be what this is all about,” Mr. Durbin said. “Your right to privacy. The limits of your right to privacy. And how much you give away in modern America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.” Mr. Zuckerberg was the only technology chief in the room, but many members of Congress treated him as a stand-in for the whole of the industry. He was summoned to Capitol Hill in the wake of revelations that sensitive data of as many as 87 million Facebook users were harvested without explicit permission by a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, which was connected to the Trump campaign. Facebook has come under a storm of criticism for the breach and for its initial response, which set off a #DeleteFacebook campaign online and sent the stock plunging more than 15 percent. But the hearing was about more than Facebook; it exposed a critical inflection point as the power, sophistication and potential exploitation of technology outpaces what users, regulators or even its creators expected or seem prepared to handle. The moment is creating a tense showdown between two national power centers — Washington and Silicon Valley — as they jockey in a technology-centric world. Although Washington has long served as a check on the power of Wall Street and other profitable sectors, lawmakers have tended to act as proud cheerleaders for technology companies, rather than watchdogs. Light-touch regulation enabled a culture of freewheeling innovation, and the beloved products that Silicon Valley companies created made them politically convenient allies. Today, five of the eight largest companies in the world are West Coast technology companies. Only a single East Coast institution, JPMorgan Chase, cracks the top 10. And lawmakers on both sides of the aisle suggested that Facebook and other companies may simply have grown too powerful to police themselves. “Have you gotten too big?” Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, asked Mr. Zuckerberg, before suggesting that Facebook might need to be reined in to protect it from itself. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook had become a monopoly, asking why Congress “should let you self-regulate?” Mr. Zuckerberg said he welcomed some form of regulation, as long as it was the “right regulation.” He also expressed support for the Honest Ads Act, a bill in Congress that would require more disclosures for online political ads. His answers did not mollify lawmakers, including Mr. Graham, who said in a statement after the hearing that “continued self-regulation is not the right answer when it comes to dealing with the abuses we have seen on Facebook.” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview that he was “unsatisfied” and that it was clear Facebook could not and would not fully regulate itself and that Congress needed to provide a solution. “The old saying: There ought to be a law,” he said. “There has to be a law. Unless there’s a law, their business model is going to continue to maximize profit over privacy.” Mr. Zuckerberg’s appearance before more than 40 senators came after weeks of preparation, and it appeared to pay off, as the executive seemed calm, deferential and prepared. Mr. Zuckerberg offered humor about the company’s onetime mantra: “move fast and break things.” (It has since been edited to “move fast with stable infrastructure.”) He insisted on continuing questions when offered a break, eliciting smiles and laughter from staff sitting behind him. However, when Mr. Zuckerberg did take a break, he left behind his notes, which were quickly photographed and contained talking points for various topics including “Defend Facebook,” “Disturbing Content” and “Election integrity (Russia).” His performance won accolades on Wall Street. “This is a different Mark Zuckerberg than the Street was fearing,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights in New York. “It’s a defining 48 hours that will determine the future of Facebook, and so far he has passed with flying colors, and the Street is relieved.” But Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that his idealistic view of humanity, and those of his fellow executives, had exposed Facebook’s roughly 2.2 billion users to danger. Among them: Facebook failed to detect and stop Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, an oversight that Mr. Zuckerberg called “one of my greatest regrets.” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Facebook and its role in society “extraordinary” and began the hearing by explaining that Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg were being singled out because of the company’s power. Mr. Thune said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how Facebook could be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared “to be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users’ information.” In an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, “In the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies’ efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.” Mr. Zuckerberg was careful when pressed on how he defined the company, wary of opening the company up to new legal liability. He said that Facebook was responsible for the content on the social network, but he argued that it was a technology company, rather than a publisher. Photo Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat from California, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg with some of the hardest questions about the Cambridge Analytica data leak. Credit Lawrence Jackson for The New York Times “I agree that we’re responsible for the content,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “But we don’t produce the content.” The primary thing that Facebook does, he added, is employ engineers and build products. Some of the hardest questions came from Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, whose name is being floated for a presidential bid. Ms. Harris pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook executives made a decision not to inform users about the Cambridge Analytica data leak when they learned in 2015 that data was sold by a researcher to the political consulting firm. The question was crucial to the Federal Trade Commission’s investigation of Facebook’s violation of a 2011 agreement to protect users’s privacy. If the company withheld information, which violates its agreement, the company could face record fines. Mr. Zuckerberg did not admit that the company explicitly decided to withhold that information from consumers, but he said the company had made a mistake in not informing users. There were glimmers of a partisan divide during the hearing. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, asked about Facebook’s handling of conservative media, including content related to Glenn Beck and a Fox News personality; Democrats questioned Mr. Zuckerberg on how quickly Facebook responded to Russian meddling in the election. But the dominant theme of the day was uncertainty about how to deal with Facebook, a complex, multifaceted giant that even technologists have struggled to define. Lawmakers — many of whom grew up in an era without social media — labored at times to understand the fine-grain nuances of Facebook’s business model, such as the difference between selling user data to advertisers and allowing advertisers to target ads to an aggregated slice of Facebook users. At one point, Mr. Zuckerberg was forced to shoot down a conspiracy theory floated by Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, that Facebook listens to users through their microphones in order to serve them ads. Mr. Zuckerberg, who spent weeks being coached for the hearing by a team of outside experts, remained cool and collected while fielding question after question. But the lawmakers’ technical sophistication was mostly irrelevant — by the end of the session, the warning had been sent: In order to avoid a much harsher regulatory glare that could include major punitive measures, Facebook needs to stop apologizing, get its act together, and show that it is capable of changing. “This episode has clearly hurt us,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “We have to do a lot of work about building trust back.” Continue reading the main story","Cardboard cutouts of Mr. Zuckerberg were set up outside the Capitol on Tuesday by Avaaz, a global advocacy group. “We have made a lot of mistakes in running the company,” Mr. Zuckerberg testified.",2018-04-11T00:37:14Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Zuckerberg Testifies Before Skeptical Lawmakers Wary of Facebook’s Power,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/zuckerberg-facebook-senate-hearing.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/11/us/politics/11zuck-highlights/11zuck-highlights-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,storm complex,1
AP,"PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) A small village of the forgotten has popped up in Diahnn Shelly Summers backyard outside Panama City. Where there once was empty grass abutting almost 5 acres of woods, 10 tents now encircle a fir tree with Christmas lights.
The tents shelter those still homeless more than four months after Hurricane Michael screamed ashore with 155-mph winds, flattening, blowing away or rendering uninhabitable thousands of houses.
There is nowhere for them to go, Summers said. When you dont have a home, you have no sense of safety, no sense of belonging, no security. You dont even know where youre going to sleep without getting into trouble. Its the worst feeling.
Of all the Florida Panhandle areas affected by Michael, Bay County was hardest hit: Officials said almost three-quarters of its 68,000 households were affected. Former Florida House Speaker Allan Bense, who is leading a hurricane recovery initiative, estimated about 20,000 people were homeless in the weeks after the October storm.
Some have been able to make their homes livable again with cosmetic repairs. Others left town: The countys student population is down 14 percent. And 7,800 residents are still considered homeless, county officials said.
Many unable to move in with relatives or find a coveted hotel room with the help of federal vouchers have turned to living in tents.
Several obstacles prevent their return to normalcy. Trailers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency have been slow to arrive, and its hard to find an apartment where the rent hasnt been jacked up in a suddenly tight market. Almost three-quarters of the damaged properties were rental units, which are difficult to replace with temporary shelter, Bay County Manager Robert Majka said.
If you have 100 units in an apartment complex, you cant put 100 FEMA trailers into that apartment complex and accommodate these folks, he said.
Sue Laurel Shaw was able to stay in her apartment after the storm and said her landlord even agreed to deduct the cost of repairs she made from the rent. But now she faces eviction for back rent after she says the landlord reneged on their agreement.
She is looking for another place to live, but everything is tripling, said Shaw, who was fighting to stay in her Panama City apartment.
Mystie Gregory said she, her fiance and 2-year-old daughter left their apartment for several days to take a break from living without electricity. When they returned, she said, it had been rented to another family.
Gregory found refuge with more than a dozen others living in tents behind Summers ranch-style house.
Gregory said she is trying to make the most of living in a tent, but it makes you feel like a failure as a parent, even though its out of your control.
Among the countys homeless are 4,700 students, said Bay District Schools Superintendent Bill Husfelt. Some schools lost more than 40 percent of their students and the school board is closing at least three schools for now.
Its all about housing, Husfelt said. Everything were dealing with, its about housing.
In December, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio wrote a letter chastising FEMA for not finding enough sites for trailers or mobile homes. Rubio said families have not seen an appropriate response to their housing needs and FEMA must immediately act to address this concern.
At the time, more than 1,200 Bay County families were waiting for trailers or mobile homes. By the end of February, that number had fallen to more than 200, partially because more than 500 families had found other options on their own, county officials said.
The velocity of FEMAs temporary housing improved after the first of the year, although trailers ... never came in consistently at stated goals, said Joel Schubert, Bay Countys assistant manager.
FEMA officials said the large numbers of renters and the enormous amount of debris that needed to be cleared before trailers could be installed slowed the process.
In addition, 26,000 Florida households received grants for home repairs, 21,000 residents received temporary rental assistance and 2,000 households were approved for hotel rooms or short-term condo rentals, FEMA spokesman Samuel Carr McKay said in a statement.
Even that help took a while to reach some residents. Dennis Myrick, who has no home insurance, said he lived in a tent in the front yard of his decimated Panama City home until mid-January, when he was finally able to get a FEMA hotel voucher.
Its pure hell, man, Myrick said. The wind blows, and you get wet. I had to hold the tent down with my hands. It was about to blow away.
Before she landed in Summers backyard, Jacinta Wheeler, whose apartment was damaged by the hurricane, joined other residents in an encampment dubbed Tent City in a different part of town. Officials forced them to leave over safety and hygiene concerns. Lori and Gene Hogan had settled in a tent on the beach after Michael destroyed their home, but police officers threatened to arrest them if they didnt move, so they came here as well.
Wheeler has been working construction jobs and helping repair neighbors properties while she stays in her tent.
Everybody wants the American dream, the Trinidad native said. If this is the dream, I dont want it.
Summers and her husband, Sam, want to build more permanent housing on the property for their guests but said they have run into regulatory roadblocks. In the meantime, they try to make them feel at home, inviting them to their dinner table and leaving the Christmas lights on the backyard tree to retain some cheer.
Summers said she has always welcomed people in need to her home.
They need help and we were blessed enough that our house was untouched, she said. We seem to be the outcasts by trying to help people and it shouldnt be that way. This should be a normal thing.

Adam Mann,"Early in Earth’s history, roughly half a billion years after the planet formed, all hell broke loose in the inner Solar System. A barrage of asteroids — some the size of Hong Kong — pummelled the globe intensely enough to melt large parts of its surface. This incendiary spree around 4 billion years ago vaporized most of Earth’s water and perhaps even sterilized its exterior, killing off any life that might have started to emerge. Only after this storm of impacts passed did the planet become safe enough for hardy organisms to take firm root and eventually give rise to all later life. That horrific episode, known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), has been an integral part of Earth’s origin story for decades, ever since geologists did a systematic study of samples brought back from the Moon by NASA Apollo missions. But now, the once-popular theory has come under attack, and mounting evidence is causing many researchers to abandon it. A growing community of planetary scientists thinks that things quietened down relatively quickly, with a steadily decreasing rain of asteroids that ended a few hundred million years after Earth and the Moon formed. Settling the debate could have major ramifications for some of the biggest questions in geoscience: when did life emerge and what were conditions like on early Earth? But some researchers think that fresh samples will be needed to finally put this conundrum to rest. They are looking with hope at the United States’ recent pledge to send astronauts back to the Moon — although no timeline has yet been set. In the meantime, the community is grappling with the fact that a key chapter of Solar System history might be vanishing before their eyes. “The Late Heavy Bombardment was seen as one of the great triumphs of the Apollo era,” says geochemist Mark Harrison of the University of California, Los Angeles. “There’s no question that something has happened in the past few years that has profoundly upset the apple cart.” The Solar System formed some 4.6 billion years ago, after the centre of a massive cloud of gas and dust collapsed into a dense sphere that became our Sun. Pebbles in a dusty disk orbiting the star continuously collided and sometimes stuck together. After tens of millions of years, these agglomerations had built up into planetesimals — the beginnings of the planets. Other rocky fragments remained, crashing into their larger kin and leaving deep craters. Over time, the Solar System thinned out, leaving something like the configuration we see today. A researcher works on rocks brought back from the Moon by NASA’s 1971 Apollo 14 mission. Credit: NASA Most of the evidence of this violent history has been erased on Earth by the churning of tectonic plates. But the scarred surface of the Moon, long inert, retains a lengthy record of impacts. Some of that record — roughly 382 kilograms of lunar rock and soil — was collected by Apollo astronauts and carried back to scientists eager to see what the samples might reveal about the Moon’s history. In 1973, the year after the last Apollo landing, a group at Sheffield University, UK, reported a curious pattern in samples from four separate Apollo missions as well as a Soviet Luna mission. Radiometric dating of each one returned the same age: 3.95 billion years 1. A team at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena corroborated the findings the same year 2. Curious chronology The confluence of ages suggested that a flurry of objects struck the Moon in a narrow 50-million-year window, leaving behind countless impact craters — including as many as a dozen of the Texas-sized basins that scar the surface. Because it seemed to represent a final surge of pandemonium after the Solar System’s chaotic genesis, the Caltech team named the event the terminal lunar cataclysm, although it later became more popularly known as the LHB. The idea was immediately divisive, in large part because of ambiguity in the rock dating. This was done primarily by measuring the rocks’ ratio of argon-40 atoms to radioactive potassium-40. 40 K decays into 40 Ar with a half-life of 1.25 billion years. At high temperatures, that 40 Ar can leak out of minerals. That makes the ratio of these two isotopes a kind of clock: the more time that has elapsed since a rock was hot, the more 40 Ar should be present. But making sense of the argon and potassium concentrations can be difficult because the same ratio could have been caused by a concentrated barrage that heated the rocks and released 40 Ar some 3.95 billion years ago, or by a long, dwindling asteroid torrent that released it in fits and starts before fizzling out at about the same time. The first really new data arrived in 2000. Planetary scientist David Kring, cosmochemist Timothy Swindle and planetary scientist Barbara Cohen, all then at the University of Arizona in Tucson, collected lunar meteorites that had fallen to Earth after being blasted from the Moon’s surface by asteroid strikes. They hoped such rocks would provide a more random sample of the Moon’s crust than those from Apollo, which represent at most 4% of the lunar surface. But when the results came back, they showed a curious, and familiar, pattern. “Frankly, I thought we’d measure a bunch of these and have ages running back to 4.3 and 4.4 [billion years] and prove once and for all that this whole idea was wrong,” says Swindle. Instead, they found no evidence of impacts before the hypothesized time of the LHB 3. “That kind of pushed me to a different side of the fence,” he says. But researchers still wondered how a bombardment could come so long after the Solar System formed. By the half-billion-year mark, most of the leftover debris should either have been cast out or have settled into stable zones such as the main asteroid belt, which sits between Mars and Jupiter, or the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune. Nobody could come up with a physical reason for the unexpected drama at such a late date. “Where did you have the bodies in the Solar System that could hang around for 600 million years and then come screaming in and hit the Moon?” asks Cohen, who is now at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. A potential answer arrived in 2005, with the emergence of what came to be known as the Nice model, after the French city where it was conceived. Originally proposed to explain odd orbital behaviour by distant icy objects in the Kuiper belt, the conjecture asserted that the Solar System’s outer planets had formed much closer to one another than they are now. Computer simulations showed 4 how the massive gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn could have created an instability that ultimately bumped Uranus and Neptune into more distant orbits, knocked comets out of remote reservoirs and kicked asteroids out of the main belt. The Nice model offered huge support for the LHB. “I think this helped cement this idea,” says physicist Nicolle Zellner of Albion College in Michigan. Geologist Marc Norman of the Australian National University in Canberra agrees. “That was the next real turning point,” he says. Cataclysmic confusion Yet just when the idea of the LHB finally seemed unimpeachable, holes began to appear. Apollo data and ‘crater counting’, which estimates the order in which craters were laid down on the basis of how they overlap, had indicated that three of the largest crater basins on the Moon’s near side — Imbrium, Nectaris and Serenitatis — might all be about 3.95 billion years old (see ‘Sampling the Moon’). But high-resolution maps from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which started circling the Moon in 2009, spotted rays of debris extending from Imbrium 5. This suggested that the impact that formed the crater might have knocked rocks into nearby Serenitatis, contaminating the Apollo samples picked up there. In 2010, a reanalysis of rocks thought to have been ejected from Nectaris indicated that they were also chemically and geologically similar to Imbrium material 6. “We started realizing that maybe we were sampling Imbrium over and over,” says Zellner. The data from lunar meteorites didn’t necessarily help. Although none of the samples seemed to be older than 4 billion years, some were billions of years younger than that 3, with no obvious spike around 3.95 billion years. And the Apollo samples held other surprises. Since 2012, detailed study 7 of microscopic regions in the rocks has turned up ages of as much as 4.2 billion years, much older than any seen before, suggesting that there had been significant impacts earlier than the proposed spike. Prodded in part by these revelations, some researchers proposed 8 a longer-lasting LHB that began around 4.1 billion or 4.2 billion years ago. But that idea had one major strike against it: some of the most ancient crystals on Earth, from the Jack Hills range in Australia, suggest 9 that the planet was a fairly clement place then, with relatively low temperatures and ample water. Hot topic Others are still scrutinizing the original Apollo evidence. To determine the samples’ ages, researchers heated the rocks to release argon, slowly ramping up the temperature. But as far back as 1991, Harrison had pointed out that the process won’t work well for rocks containing multiple minerals. Different minerals will release their argon at different temperatures. A sample heated to 400 °C might provide an age of 2 billion years; to 500 °C, an age of 2.5 billion. Researchers have tried to extrapolate from this behaviour, but Harrison says the complex patterns often lead them to pick essentially arbitrary ages. “This is quackery,” he says. “There’s no physical basis for it.” Swindle says the argon heating situation is not necessarily as bad as Harrison makes it out to be; Apollo samples can be found whose ages don’t change significantly with temperature, and their dates — whether they refer to one or multiple impacts — still cluster around 3.95 billion years. Cohen says that other chronometers, such as those using radioactive isotopes of rubidium and uranium, corroborate the argon ages (although Harrison counters that the dates can differ by as much as 600 million years). Such back and forth underscores how difficult it can be to tease small clues out of extremely ancient rocks. “Sherlock Holmes was good at resolving mysteries that happened last year,” says David Nesvorný, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. “This all happened 4 billion years ago.” Meanwhile, the Nice model has proved less helpful to the idea of an LHB than it once seemed. More-advanced simulations of the early Solar System’s gravitational interactions indicate that the planetary reshuffling probably happened shortly after formation, not with a delay of hundreds of millions of years 10. Nesvorný likens delaying the reshuffling — and so keeping the Solar System hovering on the edge of instability — to trying to balance a pencil on its tip. “It’s really hard to put the pencil there in such a way that it falls in an hour,” he says. One of the original architects of the Nice model, astronomer Alessandro Morbidelli of the Cote d’Azur Observatory in Nice, admits that the first versions took fine-tuning to get the reshuffling to occur so late. He no longer believes in the LHB, and sees many others in the field trading in the idea of a sudden asteroid deluge for that of a long, declining tail of bombardment. “My prediction is people will abandon the cataclysm,” he says. Even those who remain tied to the LHB have had to modify their ideas. Planetary scientist William Bottke of the Southwest Research Institute agrees that there is no longer much support for a single, short spike. He says the best reading of the evidence, including samples from ancient Earth and radiometric dates in meteorite rocks, is a more drawn-out surge of bombardment that began around 4.1 billion or 4 billion years ago, with a relative lull before that, consistent with the existence of surface water in that period. Astronomer William Hartmann, a visiting scientist at the International Space Science Institute in Bern, thinks the current situation proves that the idea of a cataclysm was never particularly robust. Various research communities “kind of had the impression that the other community had really solved this”, he says. “A paradigm structure was built up from supporting evidence, none of which was actually conclusive in itself.” If an LHB did not happen, that could make it easier to explain how life emerged. Evidence of microbial life has been found in rocks that are around 3.5 billion years old. But those fossils seem quite complex, suggesting that they had been evolving from earlier forms for at least a few hundred million years, during the originally hypothesized time of the LHB. Without the cataclysm, such an ancient genesis might make more sense. Then again, some evidence suggests that the microbes at the base of the tree of life were hyperthermophiles — that is, organisms that thrived in extreme heat. The intense conditions created by a rain of asteroids could have resulted in a number of pockets where life might have emerged. So far, efforts to clinch the LHB debate with evidence from other likely victims — Mercury, Venus, Mars and objects from the asteroid belt — have proved inconclusive. Each camp accuses the other of cherry-picking favourable data and not looking at the total picture. “It’s a Rorschach test,” says Norman. “People see what they want to see and disregard the rest.” The only thing that researchers say will substantially move the needle is new samples from the Moon. Kring, now at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, has developed some concepts for sample-return missions, including one that would see astronauts collecting rocks from the South Pole–Aitken basin, the largest and oldest impact crater on the Moon. However, the next human mission to the Moon is still a long way off. The first new lunar rocks to be carried back to Earth may come from China’s Chang’e-5, a robotic mission currently planned for 2019. It aims to collect samples from the volcanic Mons Rümker formation, an area younger than those explored by Apollo astronauts. Although no single exploration effort is likely to end the dispute, researchers’ improved understanding of the Moon and how to determine the ages of samples should provide greater confidence in the results. However things eventually shake out, the new evidence will shift careers and rewrite textbooks. Yet, perhaps because of the long-lived nature of this debate, those trying to make sense of the LHB remain flexible, sceptical and surprisingly lighthearted. “We are close friends and therefore we disagree all the time and then go drink a beer together,” says Bottke. “One should carry models lightly and be prepared to drop them if something better comes along, because it happens all the time.”",New analyses undermine a popular theory about an intense asteroid storm 4 billion years ago.,2018-01-24T00:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Nature.com'}",Bashing holes in the tale of Earth’s troubled youth,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01074-6?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nature%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Nature+-+Issue%29,https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-01074-6/d41586-018-01074-6_15404728.jpg,,Nature.com,storm complex,1
Emily Stewart,"The tragedy has reignited the debate about about weather safety and heeding meteorological warnings. The Missouri duck boat accident that left 17 people dead has reignited the debate about weather preparedness and the importance of heeding meteorological alerts. On Thursday evening, a Ride the Ducks tourist boat carrying 31 people capsized on Table Rock Lake in Branson, Missouri, after a strong storm hit the lake. Seventeen people, including nine from the same family, were killed in the accident, and multiple others were injured. Jim Pattinson Jr., who owns the duck boat company’s parent company, Ripley Entertainment, told CBS This Morning on Friday that the boat “shouldn’t have been in the water” but at the same time suggested the storm came on as a surprise. The strong winds “came basically out of nowhere,” he said. But weather experts have pointed out that’s not the case: The line of storms was fast-moving, yes, but there were plenty of warnings a storm was coming that should have kept the boat from going out. “The radar clearly showed a very large complex of storms approaching the lake,” Marshall Shepherd, former president of the American Meteorological Society, told the Springfield News-Leader. “If I had been at the lake under that situation, I would not have gone out.” The National Weather Service released a timeline of its weather warnings, watches, and reports in the hours before the tragedy. The Storm Prediction Center issued a severe thunderstorm watch at 11:20 am on Thursday, and the NWS issued multiple warnings for neighboring areas that evening as the storm approached the lake. The severe thunderstorm warning for Table Rock Lake came at 6:32 pm, about half an hour before authorities received their first call about the capsizing boat. Those warnings included the potential for dangerously high winds. At the nearby Branson Airport, a 63 mile-per-hour wind gust was detected at about 7:30 pm. The winds were likely stronger on the lake. “This is a reminder that you should always take severe thunderstorm warnings as seriously as you take tornado warnings,” Jonathan Erdman, a senior meteorologist at weather.com, wrote.

The AMS’s recommendations include proactive weather monitoring, risk communication planning, and developing a hierarchy for decision-making regarding dealing with the weather. It also points out that many venues have inadequate plans, if they have one at all. It cited multiple examples of weather-related tragedies that might have been preventable had more attention been paid to meteorological warnings. Shepherd, the former AMS president, in a recent piece for Forbes invoked the example of a 2011 incident at the Indiana State Fair in which a wind gust caused a stage to collapse during an outdoor concert by the band Sugarland. Seven people were killed, and 58 were injured. The AMS statement notes that the same day, an Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra performance nearby was evacuated, with thousands of attendees exiting safely from an outdoor theater. “Organizations that operate these kinds of venues have to plan for weather events, and not just hope it misses them,” Shepherd told the Springfield News-Leader. those saying the cliche ""weather was not predictable"" or that ""it came without warning"", NO NO NO, plenty of warning to make a decision on whether the #duckboat should have been in the water.. @ametsoc just provided guidance on these types of things https://t.co/pnhGQiCXUd https://t.co/Gnfh05wedA — Marshall Shepherd (@DrShepherd2013) July 20, 2018",The Missouri duck boat storm didn’t come out of nowhere — there were warnings about it for hours.,2018-07-21T16:45:19Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Vox.com'}",The Missouri duck boat storm didn’t come out of nowhere — there were warnings about it for hours,https://www.vox.com/2018/7/21/17598094/branson-missouri-duck-boat-sinking-weather,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5AteOXXyEd6zCrQIBYnIlNSPD_c=/0x214:3000x1785/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11724301/1002924956.jpg.jpg,,Vox.com,storm complex,1
Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya,"There’s a fine line between being a lot of different things at once and simply doing too much. Outlander has long blended genres and woven a narratively complex, centuries-spanning drama. But this season has been an unfocused and overloaded mess. So much has happened and yet nothing at all. The finale tears through story with little regard for the show’s past, intent on laying the groundwork for its future no doubt. It climaxes too early and then just keeps on going. In what is increasingly becoming their thing, Jamie and Claire start the episode separated, but that gets resolved pretty quickly and easily with the help of Lord John Grey, Jamie fanboy and conveniently powerful British Royal Army officer. But until they reunite for the umpteenth time this season, Claire finds herself in the evil lair of Geillis Duncan, whose characterization last episode was nothing short of a campy cartoon villain, which contradicted a lot of previous character development. The early scenes between Geillis and Claire in the finale, however, are much more in line with what their relationship used to be, and her characterization is much more nuanced and consistent. Lotte Verbeek is a damn good actor, and last episode sold her short. This one allows Verbeek and Caitriona Balfe to play off each other brilliantly. Geillis talks about how she and Claire share a special connection as time travelers, a bond that not even Jamie can understand. Suddenly, their relationship is more complicated than last episode allowed, and it works much better. Geillis suspicious of Claire and the way she keeps dropping back into her life, convinced that Claire is trying to undo the work she has devoted herself to since learning about her ability to travel through time. The difference between Geillis and Claire ultimately boils down to the way they view their time-travel abilities. Geillis thinks they are chosen ones, that they have an obligation to change history. Claire doesn’t seem to really think she has a destiny or even view her ability to time-travel as something like a superpower. For her, it’s more about Jamie, about allowing her to find and be with the love of her life. Geillis has a zealous compulsion to alter history, to ensure that a Scottish king rises, and she’s willing to do whatever it takes to get it done. That includes killing young boys, because she’s for some reason convinced that a sacrifice is required to travel through time, even though Claire has never had to do one. And the show just sort of throws that out there without any real clarification. Does the sacrifice really mean something? Or is Geillis mistaken? Outlander has been intentionally ambiguous about a lot of its mythology, because it’s not really a part of the story. Or, at least, it didn’t used to be. Even when Jamie and Claire were working to change history, the show didn’t delve too deeply into the logistics of time-travel, and it worked, because time-travel logistics quickly become tedious and headache-inducing. Geillis and Claire talking about a special connection that she share because of their gifts is, indeed, much more compelling than either of them talking about what’s required or not required in order to pass through time and why. But at a certain point, it just starts to feel lazy, as if the mythology hasn’t been thought out at all. Margaret, the fortune-telling woman who Yi Tien Cho intends to marry, is a very poorly written character, and the scene of her reading Jamie and Claire is tedious and unnecessary. What does it really add to the story? The moments that immediately follow Claire killing Geillis are especially elusive. Claire’s forced to kill her in order to save Brianna, who Geillis becomes convinced is the 200-year-old baby that Margaret’s prophecy foretold would have to die for a Scottish king to rise. Traumatized by the fact that she just nearly beheaded her old friend, Claire flashes back to the time she intuitively identified bones with Joe Abernathy. There’s no doubt that those bones belonged to Geillis, that she was the person who tried to cut her head clean off, as Joe puts it. The implications are huge. Claire knew subconsciously about something that happened in the past before she even lived through it (in the past-present), suggesting that there’s some complicated time loop at play. It’s a lot to wrap your mind around, but Outlander breezes through it swiftly, doesn’t land on any real conclusions about it and what it could mean for Claire and her actions. Seconds after the very climatic and intense scene of Geillis’ death, we’re suddenly on a ship back to Scotland, Claire and Jamie wasting no time before getting down to business (fucking). And look, it’s a great sex scene, mostly for the reason that we don’t even get to the sex. It’s an entire scene of dirty talk and playful kissing and touching, as Jamie details exactly how he wants to fuck Claire. Television usually skips over foreplay, and here Outlander delivers an entire scene of just foreplay. It’s intoxicating. And it’s almost captivating enough to make you forget that we literally just watched Claire murder Geillis mere seconds ago. But alas, “Eye Of The Storm” induces a whiplash not unlike the suddenly storm that strikes their ship. It’s dizzying, and it’s hard to find anything to really latch onto. “Eye Of The Storm” also continues some of the worst aspects of last episode when Claire and Jamie stumble upon some sort of ceremony being performed around a fire in the jungle. The ceremony and the people participating in it are unspecific and exoticized, Claire and Jamie looking on as white spectators to something they don’t understand and don’t really care to. The ceremony turns violent when Yi Tien Cho kills Margaret’s brother, and the whole thing just reeks of racism and stereotype. Outlander has zero interest in exploring these people or what they’re doing—only in establishing a certain mood. It’s gross and completely unnecessary. “Eye Of The Storm” packs in too much and spends way too long on scenes that offer little. It rips through the story without letting the full impact of any new development land. Its mythology expands (hey, there’s another portal through time!), and yet that has no real implications for the larger story. The seasons that precede it have all had clear throughlines and an overarching story. What was season three’s? At first, it’s Claire and Jamie finding each other again, but after that, the show has wobbled, struggling to tell any one story coherently or convincingly, continuously relying on splitting Jamie and Claire apart physically for any real sense of stakes. The final scenes of the episode bestow Claire and Jamie with perhaps the most luck they’ve ever had. After a very lengthy storm sequence, Claire is knocked overboard, and we return to the finale’s opening scene, a swirling underwater shot of Claire as she muses in voiceover about how she felt at peace in those minutes when she was pretty much dead. That’s some dark shit that goes relatively unacknowledged the second she’s back to life again. And exactly how does she survive? Jamie jumps in the water and pulls her to the surface, but not before pausing to kiss her under water as she dies slowly? I’m a sucker for a gorgeously shot underwater scene, but Jamie kissing Claire is so stupid that I actually laughed in disbelief. He at last brings her above water, grabs onto a piece of the wrecked ship, and begs her not to die. Claire probably should have taught him CPR at some point. But it doesn’t matter really. Even though they’re only in the calm eye of the storm and not actually in the clear, they somehow wash up on the shores of America alive and in love. I can suspend my disbelief a lot with this show, but this ending pushes it and for very little payoff. Despite a lot of action in the episode, it’s surprisingly stagnant—not the wild ride it thinks it is. Stray observations Well, folks, we made it to the end of another season of Outlander. Even though I’ve been very critical of this season, I really do love the show and want it to get back on course. I’m devastated that Geillis is gone once and for all but am even more upset about the way the character was handled in these last two episodes. I’m excited to see what happens to Claire and Jamie next on their new adventure in America. Season four is slated for 2018. That being said, Geillis saying that she and Claire share a special connection that not even Jamie can share with her made my little Geillis/Claire shipper heart sing. Controversial perhaps, but I love Jamie’s bangs. This is my favorite hairdo of his. As flawed as this episode is, Balfe still turns in a killer performance.","There’s a fine line between being a lot of different things at once and simply doing too much.

Andrea Thompson,"It was not the news residents of the Florida Panhandle wanted to wake up to: Hurricane Michael had strengthened overnight into a category 4 storm, sporting winds of 140 miles per hour. And it didn’t stop there. The hurricane remarkably continued to intensify until it slammed into land Wednesday afternoon with devastating 155 mph winds at its core—just shy of a category 5 designation. Michael’s jump from category 2 to 4 in just 24 hours was far from the first time a hurricane has made such a major leap in strength: Hurricane Harvey ramped up quickly before it hit Texas last year, and in 2004 Charley made the same jump as Michael in just three hours before battering southwest Florida. In the 14 years since Charley meteorologists have made significant strides in understanding why storms undergo such rapid intensification—generally defined as a storm strengthening by 30 knots (34.5 mph) within 24 hours—and in predicting when and where they will do so. Even within the last two years some new forecast methods are showing promise for a problem that had long seemed intractable. “I think we’re seeing a huge leap forward,” says Chris Rozoff, a project scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. #HurricaneMichael intensified as the storm made landfall near Mexico Beach, Florida, at around 1:30 p.m. ET. @NOAA 's #GOESEast satellite captured this view of the Cat. 4 hurricane moving ashore. Latest updates from @NHC_Atlantic : https://t.co/gcFrOMm2RR pic.twitter.com/ZIqmQslbYP — NOAA Satellites (@NOAASatellites) October 10, 2018 3 Ingredients For a tropical storm or hurricane to rapidly intensify, it needs three key ingredients: low wind shear, warm ocean water and high humidity. The first refers to winds blowing at various speeds and in different directions in the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere. Strong wind shear knocks a hurricane off-kilter and disrupts its development. Warm ocean water increases the temperature contrast between Earth’s surface and cooler layers higher in the atmosphere, which increases air instability and fuels the convection that drives the storm. Reduced humidity would also rob the convection process of fuel. All three of these ingredients were present with Michael—an unusual situation for this time of year, this far north in the Gulf of Mexico. Generally, by October cold fronts have started to press southward across the U.S., bringing relatively high wind shear and dry air with them. But Michael has been embedded in a fairly humid air current, says Brian Tang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Albany, S.U.N.Y. Ocean waters have also typically begun to cool off from their end-of-summer peak, but this year stagnant air patterns have kept the waters in the Gulf unusually warm, he adds. But even with all those ingredients, “it’s not always a guarantee” rapid intensification will occur, says Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. It will not happen without the processes in the core of the hurricane “coming together to complete the job,” Rozoff says. Accurately modeling those processes—even just a day in advance—is extremely difficult because they happen on such a small scale. But researchers are starting to understand what to signals to look for, and models are continually improving. “We’re definitely understanding more and more of the details of how that occurs,” Tang says. A more compact storm with higher winds and thunderstorms concentrated near its center seems to have an easier time undergoing rapid intensification than a bigger one does. Its smaller size means it can more efficiently pull air toward its center, concentrating angular momentum; the classic analogy is how figure skaters pull in their arms to spin faster. Hurricane Charley was a prime example of a small storm that was able to do this. In addition to the favorable environment it was in, Michael was also showing some of these signs on Tuesday, including lightning that indicated strong thunderstorms close to its core. Improving Predictions Computer models have become far more detailed over the last decade, and some are used specifically to look for the potential for rapid intensification. With Michael, “they saw the conditions would all be primed for this to happen,” McNoldy says. Rozoff is working on another method to help predict rapid strengthening: He uses machine learning to have computers take the hurricane model predictions and look for historic examples that are close matches. Whether or not those matches involved rapid intensification can help predict whether it might happen with the current storm. This method captured what would happen with Michael better than some other models did, Rozoff says. He hopes the National Hurricane Center might eventually use it as one of its forecasting tools. There is still room to improve predictions of rapid intensification, as models become more complex and as observations provide more examples for scientists to dissect in order to understand the underlying physics. But there may be a limit to just how far in advance such strength jumps can be predicted, because of the small scale of the key processes involved; any tiny errors present at beginning of the forecast are increasingly magnified the farther out the forecast looks. Such errors matter less when predicting the path a hurricane will take, by contrast, because that path is determined by larger patterns in the atmosphere. Hurricane Michael will surely be one of the case studies that scientists dig into to improve their models and forecasts. The potential for such last-minute strengthening before landfall is one of the reasons Rozoff and others have cited to study rapid intensification and improve storm warnings. But although this kind of situation is “stuff we talked about in theory,” he says, no meteorologist actually wants to see it happen in real life.",Scientists have made major strides in recent years in understanding why storms rapidly intensify -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2018-10-11T11:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Why Did Hurricane Michael Rev Up to Category 4 So Quickly?,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-did-hurricane-michael-rev-up-to-category-4-so-quickly/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/5B541764-FD0F-43B8-A31987DCDF144DB4.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,storm complex,1
Heather Wilde,"Recently, you may have heard of something called "" blockchain."" Over the past year, this nascent technology has left the fringes of early-adopters and taken the world by storm. Mainly, this has been through crypto-currencies built upon it, such as Bitcoin, Etherium, and even Dogecoin. These crypto-currencies have in turn spawned their own field called or ""Initial Coin Offerings"" or ICOs. These ICOs can either be designed to be currency, tied to the value of the crypto-currency they're built upon, and then trade at a dollar value, or they can be a ""token."" If they're a token, they aren't worth money -- but rather future credits toward product for the company who is selling them. In other words, many of the ICOs out there essentially act as a new type of Kickstarter to get a product off the ground. And, like Kickstarter, some of these products have a long lead time before they will come to fruition. Chris Plance, CEO of Veris Foundation, is issuing one such ICO. Veris is set up as a nonprofit, which forces them to have a higher level of transparency in their bookkeeping and reporting than a regular company, which he feels is important. ""There are too many scams out there -- people need to be able to see where their money is being used."" What Veris aims to do is change the way healthcare claims are processed, utilizing the blockchain to both simplify and secure it end-to-end. Plance admits that this is a complex problem and ""a lot of things still need to be figured out."" He was adamant that ""we will make this process easy for everyone involved."" As current blockchain solutions in the space are not user-friendly, he mentioned: ""that's exactly what we want to avoid."" While the Veris ICO begins in March 2018, they likely won't have a pilot version of their product until 2019. In the meantime, people who decide to purchase it will have no guarantees of a release date or even validity. These are issues Plance has hoped to mitigate with their nonprofit filing, but what of the many other ICOs out there? Recently, Facebook and Google have attempted to address this by disallowing all ICOs from advertising on their platform, regardless of their purported legitimacy. As there are governing bodies overseeing ICOs, crypto-currencies or the blockchain as of yet, they're banning ad purchases for the time being. In the meantime, how can you protect yourself from purchasing vaporware? 1. Use Caution Have you ever heard the phrase ""If it seems too good to be true, it probably is?"" In the case of ICOs, there are people who appear to be creating tokens with the sole intent to take other people's money. What's worse, others (including some pretty famous and credible people) are latching on to these junk coins, buying them in bulk and artificially inflating their prices, advertising them then dumping them for a profit. 2. Do Your Research Rather than blindly ""Buy Buy Buy!"" whenever someone else urges you to, instead you should look into the company behind that coin. If they seem legitimate, then it may be something to consider. Otherwise, steer clear. 3. Be Patient If you're purchasing into a company like Veris, remember that it is a company with a real product that takes time to create. Like those Kickstarters that (sometimes laughably) could take 2-3 years to produce a product, these blockchain startups need time to get their ambitious projects off the ground. If you believe in what they're trying to do, offer them support and encouragement instead of complaints for the delays. Like any investment, buying into an ICO should not be chosen without a proper understanding of what you're getting. If you need help figuring any of this out, go ahead and contact me or drop a line in the comments.",Google and Facebook are cracking down on ICOs because of get-rich-quick schemes.

Jacob Shamsian,"Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba in ""Molly's Game."" STXFilms Few screenwriters have writing as recognizable as Aaron Sorkin's. Known for his snappy dialogue and abrasive male characters, he's responsible for some of the most acclaimed dramas of the past 25 years, like ""A Few Good Men,"" ""The West Wing,"" and ""The Social Network."" With ""Molly's Game,"" he takes up directing duties for the first time, too. The movie is based on the life of Molly Bloom, who grabbed headlines in 2013 when, in her 20s, she was charged with running high-stakes poker games that drew celebrities like Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Ben Affleck, sports stars like Alex Rodriguez, finance titans, and a network of mobsters. Tabloids named her the ""poker princess."" Bloom wrote a memoir about her experience, and Sorkin's movie — starring Jessica Chastain — draws from the book as well as the court cases that followed. Sorkin can never resist a good courtroom scene. Why should you care: Aaron Sorkin moves up the Hollywood ladder — and he gives Jessica Chastain a great role. Every movie Aaron Sorkin writes is worth looking at, so it's exciting that he brought his talents to directing as well. For the movie, he assembled an excellent cast, with Jessica Chastain, Idris Elba, and Michael Cera as the main characters. Michael Cera plays ""Player X,"" a stand-in for Tobey Maguire. STXFilms Fun fact: ""Molly's Game"" is also the second movie of the year to have a mini-speech about how it's terrible to place fourth in the Olympics, after ""I, Tonya."" What's hot: It's a fun, rollicking story. Simply put, it's fun to watch Bloom go from wide-eyed college graduate to running secret high-stakes poker games for the 1%, crash back down, and then try to redeem herself. It's a compelling, gossipy story, and Sorkin has fun with it. The casting is great. Chastain breathes life into Sorkin's witty dialogue instead of spitting it out like an angry robot. She's the perfect person to play Molly Bloom, an ethically-conflicted woman who takes the world by storm and cracks down on men. Cera's Tobey Maguire (referred to as ""Player X"" in the movie) is funny, but he also manages to depict him as a sneaky operator, like he comes across in Bloom's memoir. And Elba, always welcome in a movie, is a solid presence as Bloom's lawyer. Idris Elba plays Bloom's lawyer, Charlie Jaffey. STXFilms One of Sorkin's favorite subjects is the justice system, and it's interesting to see Bloom grapple with hard questions. She has a respect for the law — she planned to go to law school before getting involved in gambling — and she struggles to balance that with her own ethical decisions. What's not: Sorkin's weakness as a director highlights his script's flaws. Sorkin isn't much of a visual stylist. ""Molly's Game"" looks like it could have been directed by anyone, and especially suffers in comparison to movies like ""The Social Network,"" which director David Fincher deepened with visual parallels to movies like ""Citizen Kane."" The sluggish style also lays bare some flaws. Sorkin thinks he can get away with his shaky understanding of technology with fast dialogue, but it doesn't work — a few lines about hard drives and texting records, for example, don't quite make sense. Jessica Chastain as Molly Bloom. STXFilms Some of Sorkin's screenwriting cliches and weaknesses are also on full display. It's great that he's written a strong woman as the main character for one of his movies. But he also makes her less complex than she was in her own memoir, where Bloom has a misogynistic streak. At one point in the book, a man remarks that she ""should be barefoot and pregnant, doing yoga or shopping,"" and Bloom writes that ""it was the first time in a while that a man had spoken to me like I was a woman."" Bloom never coherently makes up her mind over whether she likes chauvinism or not. Sorkin never gets around to analyzing that. But he does do plenty of psychoanalyzing about Bloom and her father, which was so silly I blushed. In one scene, Bloom's father finds her in Central Park and gives a whole sermon about how she does everything to win her father's approval. It's like the ending of ""Psycho"" except she ran a series of gambling rings instead of murdering and pretending to be her mom. Freud works in mysterious ways. Kevin Costner plays Molly Bloom's father in ""Molly's Game."" STXFilms The movie also has this whole conceit about Arthur Miller's play ""The Crucible,"" and leads up to Bloom quoting John Proctor's ""Because it is my name"" monologue. It's kind of weird, and if you want to see a better version of it, watch Daniel Day-Lewis in the 1989 movie adaptation of the play. The bottom-line: Jessica Chastain leads a great story with the usual Sorkin problems. ""Molly's Game"" is fun, satisfying entertainment. It's a good story, a solid script, and has great actors. I only wish it went a little further. The movie admirably takes the plot further than Bloom's book — and actually turns her decision to write the book into a whole plot point — but also doesn't analyze her character beyond the obvious points. The movie also has problems you'll often find in Sorkin's scripts. He's always trying to tell the viewer that he's really smart, but he says a lot of dumb things in the process.

Richard Baguley,"As computer networks get bigger, it becomes increasingly hard to keep track of the flow of data over this network. How do you route data, making sure that the data is spread to all parts of the network? You use an algorithm called the spanning tree protocol — just one of the contributions to computer science of a remarkable engineer, Dr. Radia Perlman. But before she created this fundamental Internet protocol, she also worked on LOGO, the first programming language for children, creating a dialect for toddlers. Born in 1952, Perlman was a prodigy who excelled in math and science, and in her own words, “Every time there was a new subject or a quiz I would be very excited at the opportunity to solve all sorts of puzzles”. She graduated from MIT in 1973 and got her Masters degree in 1976. While she was working on her Master’s degree, she worked with Seymour Papert at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, which was working on LOGO, the first programming language for children. In the simplest version of this language, kids could learn the fundamentals of programming by writing programs that controlled the motion of an on-screen or motorized turtle. Perlman created Turtles Own Recursive Turtle Interpreter System (TORTIS), a simplified version of LOGO that could be used by pre-school children. This was controlled by buttons that allowed the toddler to experiment with a Logo turtle with a less intimidating interface than existing systems. “Most important of all,” the abstract for her paper describing the project says, “it should teach that learning is fun.” After getting her masters and leaving MIT, Perlman joined BBN, a defense contractor, then moved to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1980. At DEC, she was tasked with looking into ways to deal with the increasing complexity of the local area networks (LANs) that the company was creating. Specifically, how do you stop data from getting trapped in a loop? Imagine a small network of two computers connected to a router. When one device sends out a data packet, the switch (a router that includes the ability to switch data between multiple ports) passes it onto the other device. But LANs are seldom that simple, and with more computers being connected to the nascent Internet, it was getting harder to figure out how to effectively and efficiently route data between multiple switches. To create networks that could survive the loss of a connection, a switch would be connected to multiple other switches. That way, if one connection failed, you had a backup. You also have multiple possible ways to route data, which creates the possibility of loops. A loop is where one switch passes a packet of data to another, which then sends it back to the first. The first switch then resends it to the second, and so on. That can create a broadcast storm, where the links between switches become filled with these echoing packets. So how do you avoid this? Perlman’s solution was deceptively simple. She created the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which allows each switch in the network to figure out its place in the scheme of things. This innovative standard was codified in the IEEE standard 802.1D, last revised in 2004. Each switch is assigned a number by the network designer, called the Bridge ID (BID) which indicates its prominence in the network. The switch with the lowest BID is designated as the root bridge. If you think of it as the root system of a tree, the root bridge is the base of the trunk, the point where the root system begins. Below this, each switch is a branch of the root system, branching off and reaching the devices at the root tips. It’s more complex than a tree root, though: there are multiple links between root branches, and sometimes these links get cut. To negotiate this, each of the switches periodically sends out special data packets called Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) that contain the BID and another number called the path cost for each connection it has available. This number is calculated from the bandwidth that the connection offers: the lower the path cost, the higher the bandwidth the connection offers. As each switch receives the BPDU from its neighbors, it uses the path cost to decide which connection to use: the lower the cost, the more favorable the connection is. It then sends out its own BPDUs to neighbors, which use this information to calculate which connections to use. This then propagates through the network until every switch knows its place, and which routes are most efficient to use. If a connection fails, the switch sends out a specially flagged BPDU that contained the details of the remaining connections, which the other switches use to recalculate. In effect, the network would route around the damage and just keep working. It is such a simple solution that it now appears obvious, but Dr Perlman struggled to get her fellow engineers to accept it, because it was so simple. Many engineers struggled to accept that the answer to the problem could be that simple. “My designs were so deceptively simple that it was easy for people to assume I just had easy problems,” she told the Atlantic, “whereas others, who made super-complicated designs (that were technically unsound and never worked) and were able to talk about them in ways that nobody understood, were considered geniuses.” The beauty of the STP is that none of the routers need to know the details of the entire network to work: all it needs to know is its own BID and the route cost of the connection to its immediate neighbors. The inverted tree of the network is automatically created by each of the switches using the information it has to decide how to route data. It’s perhaps best described by a poem that Perlman herself wrote in the patent application for the standard and the academic paper describing the protocol (PDF link): Algorhyme I think that I shall never see a graph more lovely than a tree. A tree whose crucial property is loop-free connectivity. A tree that must be sure to span so packet can reach every LAN. First, the root must be selected. By ID, it is elected. Least-cost paths from root are traced. In the tree, these paths are placed. A mesh is made by folks like me, then bridges find a spanning tree. Although the original STP has since been replaced by enhanced and updated versions such as the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RTSP), the fundamental idea of a self-organizing, adaptive network remains one of the underpinnings of networking and the Internet. Many of these replacement protocols have been created with the input of Perlman, who continues to work on networking standards such as and TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links ( TRILL ). Although the networks of the Internet are now far more complex than those she first thought about in the 1970’s, the survival of these networks owes much to her innovative, and we would say creative, thinking.","As computer networks get bigger, it becomes increasingly hard to keep track of the flow of data over this network.

Micah Peters,"The most tattooable image of Huey P. Newton was taken in 1967, when the cofounder of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was about 25 years old. The photo, shot by Blair Stapp, finds Newton sitting on a round wicker chair, a beret on his head, a black leather duster on his back, a spear and a rifle in either hand. It is an image that projects strength and elicits feelings of pride. And when the first official poster for Marvel’s Black Panther was released, the resemblance was tough to miss : io9 This only makes sense for a movie titled Black Panther, with a majorly black cast and a black director, arriving during Black History Month. The last leg of the promotional tour brought Michael B. Jordan to the cover of British GQ, glowering in pensive black and white styled in … a beret and a leather duster. The cover was lauded as a celebration of the legacy of the Black Panther party as an organization that inspired the black community to dignify and protect itself. The less sexy way to read Jordan’s look for the GQ cover was as an advertisement. Like the dubious GQ cover, the story of the Marvel property itself has often been one of its capital-I Importance clashing with the fact of its profitability. The same could be said of almost every other piece of politicized culture we consume, from Moonlight to Star Wars to Kendrick Lamar. But the relationship between Black Panther, as a franchise, and the cachet of the real-world imagery on which it trades, is a complicated one. It’s also one that’s changed a lot since the character was introduced to the reading public 52 years ago. At times like this, it’s worth tracing the character’s origins. His alter ego was almost the Coal Tiger, and his story began clumsily. In July 1966, an African chieftan gave Reed Richards a flying craft. The rest of the Fantastic Four, and indeed the world, had never heard of the man who would become the first black superhero of mainstream American comics. With the glossy cover of Fantastic Four no. 52, Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, legends of the medium, introduced “The Sensational Black Panther!” To note, the inception and early stewardship of the character is very much the work of white guys. This is the first panel of the comic that introduced him: Fantastic Four no. 52 It’s cringey to read in 2018, but it makes a kind of sense. The team is suspicious of someone from Africa having nice things, just like many white Americans would be in the 1960s. Africa was still represented as the big, primitive monolith that it was depicted as in the 1932 Tarzan movie cited by the Thing. Kirby and Lee worked against the notion with T’Challa, a warrior king with a genius intellect and deeper pockets than J. Paul Getty. His native Wakanda was a sovereign kingdom of impossibly futuristic circuitry and tribal customs, yet to be seen by the likes of the outside world, much less colonized. A little more than three months after the debut of the Black Panther character, the Black Panther Party was officially founded in Oakland, in 1966. Which came first is kind of a chicken-or-the-egg thing. In 1972, with Fantastic Four no. 119, Marvel unveiled a new name for the character. I reached out to writer Roy Thomas, who penned the comic in which T’Challa pulled on his costume and explained why he’d suddenly started calling himself “the Black Leopard.” “Since the debut of Marvel’s Black Panther had coincided, roughly, with the rise of the Black Panther Party, that had made Stan [Lee] and Marvel concerned that we’d become identified with that group,” Thomas said. “And we weren’t for or against it.” Fantastic Four no. 119 “I wound up being the guy who wrote that story, in my first-ever Fantastic Four story (ironically set in Rudyarda, a fictitious stand-in for South Africa under apartheid), and I worked in an explanation of sorts,” he continued. “But Stan soon thought better of it, and I don’t think the Black Leopard ever appeared as such in many stories.” Neither for nor against neatly explained the Black Panther’s politics at the time. Making the character be from a futuristic country in Africa was groundbreaking. But it also allowed the Black Panther character a certain distance from the civil rights movement that—wittingly or not—the series capitalized on. “The Black Leopard” didn’t stick, but the creators’ reticence toward directly commenting on the world in which Black Panther existed did. The Panther got his own series in 1973, written by a different white guy, named Don McGregor. Three years later, he took the Black Panther to the American South to fight the Ku Klux Klan, although that doesn’t totally make up for the fact the Black Panther’s first solo series was titled Jungle Action (yes, for real). McGregor’s run was more considered than its name; McGregor explored the world Kirby and Lee created, and rendered Wakanda more human and alive by asking more questions about it: About how monarchical rule would be received in a modern era, about what citizens of an African isolationist country might think of a king who spends a lot of his time abroad with white people. In what ways would being a superhero be at odds with being a king? Jungle Action no. 5 McGregor made T’Challa and Wakanda more complex, and he introduced villains who spoke like dissidents. In Panther’s Rage, McGregor’s first big story arc, the king returned home from kicking ass with the Avengers to find the legitimacy of his claim to the throne challenged. First by M’Baku the Man-Ape, a remnant from a bygone era, and then by Erik Killmonger, a radical new threat. In the film, Winston Duke plays M’Baku and Michael B. Jordan stars as Killmonger. People say that the collected edition of McGregor’s Panther’s Rage arc is required pre-film reading. I, on the other hand, would never tell you to read a book. That is unless it’s one of the volumes from Black Panther by Christopher Priest: The Complete Collection. The next truly exciting thing to happen to the character didn’t occur until the late ’90s. Priest was the first black writer to touch the character, and he spent 62 issues, the first of which was published in 1998, explaining—to Marvel, to readers, to the world—everything that the Black Panther was capable of, all the things he could mean. “It seems, after Fantastic Four no. 52 and no. 53, everybody kind of forgot who Panther was and treated him like Joe Blow,” Priest told Newsarama in 2015. “King T’Challa is not Joe Blow.” Black Panther no. 8 Priest’s run wasn’t fully appreciated in its own time, but he did revolutionize the character, creating the cool, dignified, master strategist we know today. New York Times best-selling author Ta-Nehisi Coates, whom you may have heard has his own Black Panther series now, considers Priest to have “ the classic run on Black Panther, period, and that’s gonna be true for a long time.” Though he’s perhaps America’s foremost thinker about race, or the writer whom a lot of Americans look to for sharp thinking about race, Coates doesn’t spend much time on race in his own run. In early January, he told Deadspin : “The question about race is ultimately just a question about power, it really is. It’s how human beings organize themselves around power, how they exploit, how they use it. That is at the heart of the comic book. … The dude’s in this mythical country Wakanda where everybody’s black. So obviously you don’t have the same context of race. But certainly the issues of power, of organizing power, are still there.” That’s an incredible theme that immediately sounds important and promises broader commentary. This is the same person who wrote Between the World and Me —a book about the sobering reality of “progress” in the United States being achieved over mounds of black bodies—writing a comic about a black superhero called Black Panther. But it’s important to remember that it’s still a comic, based in a world that isn’t this one. Much like how the film version of Black Panther, while a watershed moment, is one part of a multiphase, multiyear plan laid out by Marvel and paid for by Disney. Matching Coates’s expertise with the Black Panther was a no-brainer for Marvel’s recent push toward diversity and inclusion; Iron Man was black in the ’80s, but now Iron Man is also a woman. The Hulk is Korean American. Marjorie Liu penned the first gay marriage in comics for Astonishing X-Men in 2012; in 2014, Thor became the eighth Marvel title to feature a female lead protagonist. Coates wrote for The Atlantic in February 2015 about how comics can just do these things, for the simple reason that the cost of printing a 20-page issue isn’t as prohibitive as the cost of making a movie. He cites Alexandra Shipp’s role in 2016’s X-Men: Apocalypse as Storm, a superheroine descended from a line of African priestesses who could wield magic, as an example of almost representative, but not quite. (Still, like Halle Berry before her, Shipp didn’t look like the dark-skinned Kenyan woman that was in the comics.) Two years later we have Black Panther, and it’s fine if some elements of the rollout have been cynical, or downright awkward. We have a blockbuster movie with a black lead, and a black director, premiering during Black History Month. The Black Panther exists ( if you ask Stan Lee ) because Stan Lee noticed that there weren’t enough black superheroes and thought hey, let’s make some. But now the story has been carried to the silver screen in the hands of the people who are best equipped to tell the truest and most interesting version of it. It’s still a movie, and it won’t save us, so to speak. But it is, like I said before, a gigantically big deal. Started as a refugee from a Tarzan movie, now we’re here.","In July 1966, an African chieftain gave Reed Richards a flying craft.

Anna Johansson,"April 19, 2018 4 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. Financial emergencies have the potential to ruin your business if you aren’t careful. Though the failure rate for startups is often exaggerated, it’s still relatively high: 20 percent of businesses fail within the first year, and about half of U.S. businesses fail within five years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Related: Re­inventing Yourself: Life After a Business Failure Most of these failures are the result of a complex sequence of factors, as startup entrepreneurs explained in their business post-mortems. Those factors include a lack of market need, an inappropriate team or heavy competition. Then there's running out of cash, the second-most-cited factor in these post-mortems -- with 29 percent of companies having claimed to experience it before failing. An unexpected expense or sudden cost increase is often responsible for the shortfall, and it may well be the final breaking point for a business that’s already struggling. So, what’s the right way to deal with a financial emergency as an entrepreneur? Consider these past examples of well-known startups that almost failed due to financial emergencies -- but ended up recovering: 1. FedEx Within the first two years of starting FedEx, founder Frederick Smith found his company so many millions of dollars in debt, because of sharply rising fuel costs, that he was nearly ready to declare bankruptcy. When FedEx's cash reserves had been depleted to just $5,000, the company started asking pilots to use their personal credit cards and uncashed paychecks to fuel their planes. It was at this point that Smith gambled the last of the company’s savings on blackjack -- which is true. But the real saving grace was an additional $11 million in funding and a brand-new advertising campaign. 2. Tesla and SpaceX Two of the most curious and innovative tech companies in the country, both started by Elon Musk, almost faced collapse in the wake of the 2008 economic recession. Musk himself told Bloomberg that he had the money to keep one company afloat, but certainly not both. Then a combination of factors allowed him to keep both businesses in operation; for starters, he sold off some of his investments and asked Tesla investors for more funds. But the biggest path forward? A new $1.6 billion contract from NASA, which kept SpaceX not only alive but thriving. Related: The 9 Biggest Financial Warning Signs 3. Apple Apple was a company founded on innovation. But that innovation disappeared as Apple began to age without the leadership of visionary Steve Jobs. After a series of failed products, tough financial circumstances and apparently no ideas of how to become a dominant tech force again, the company reinstated Jobs and made it his mission to restore the innovation that had made the company succeed in its earliest stages. A few years later, Apple introduced the iPod, the iTunes store and, eventually, the iPhone, all of which helped to take Apple from a barely stable, once-successful company to a new kind of tech giant. 4. Kodak Kodak never relived its truest glory days as a photography giant, but after filing for bankruptcy in 2012 (in the wake of the digital photography revolution), it saw a decent recovery. A thorough corporate reorganization and a renewed focus on business-imaging needs kept the company from repeating its mistakes and gave it a fighting chance for success in the modern digital era. Profits and growth remain thin, but the company has weathered a storm that could have financially destroyed it. The takeaways These entrepreneurs and brands took drastic measures to save money, even asking employees for sacrifices, pushing hard for new funding and radically reinventing their companies. You, too, can prepare for a financial emergency in advance by maintaining an emergency fund for your business, just as you would for your personal finances. If you have enough cash, you can set it aside; and, if not, you can open a business line of credit so you always have funds to tap into. Related: 6 Tips For Avoiding Financial Disaster When Starting a Business Of course, if you find yourself in a difficult situation that your emergency savings and credit line can’t bail you out of, you still have the option to make cuts, seek a new injection of capital or reinvent yourself, all in the service of survival.","Take heart, knowing that Tesla, Apple and FedEx have also been there -- and survived.",2018-04-19T17:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",The Best Ways to Deal with a Financial Emergency As an Entrepreneur,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/312147,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20180418193246-GettyImages-145061984.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,storm complex,1
James Whitbrook,"There was a lot—a lot —that went wrong in the culmination of the original X-Men movie trilogy. For starters, it tried to go all-in with its own version of the iconic Phoenix saga from the comics, but did so while shunting aside Famke Janssen’s Jean Grey to supporting-role status. Now that the next generation of X-films has gotten around to the saga (because of course they have), it wants to do a better job. That starts, according to cast and crew speaking with Entertainment Weekly, by making sure that the film’s primary roster of female characters—including Sophie Turner’s Jean Grey, Jennifer Lawrence’s Mystique, Alexandra Shipp’s Storm, and Jessica Chastain’s mysterious new alien character —actually interact with each other in meaningful ways. Turner said: It’s really exciting. I think there’s such a revolution in superhero movies. I feel like this movie is a revelation because of it being like a drama but the hero is a female and she’s also the villain. It really is about her relationships with the females in the film, especially Jessica Chastain’s character. It’s really interesting to have those two characters be kind of the two biggest characters in the movie and both be female and so layered and so complex. It also means invoking the famous Bechdel-Wallace Test, which measures if two female characters in a story speak to each other about something that isn’t related to a male character. Considering what a low bar that is, it’s depressing we still have to bring it up in 2017. The good news is, according to Jessica Chastain, Dark Phoenix passes with flying colors: I’ve always wanted to do a big comic book franchise-y film but I had some issues with the female characters in the films I was being offered. I was really pleased with this script because I think it’s a departure from the norm. This definitely passes the Bechdel test and I don’t know how many comic book films can say that. Thankfully, some can. Dark Phoenix apparently even acknowledges the X-Men’s female core at one point, with EW confirming there’s a scene in which Mystique comments to Professor X that perhaps the team should think about renaming themselves to the “X-Women,” considering the female heroes save the men’s mutant butts all the time.

Dominique Mosbergen,"Hours after Puerto Rico officials announced that power had finally been restored to almost all of the island’s residents — almost a year after Hurricane Maria devastated the U.S. territory — a new problem with the power grid reportedly plunged thousands of people into the dark once more. Puerto Rico’s electric provider tweeted Monday that just 0.002 percent of its nearly 1.4 million customers (some 25 people) remained without electricity, marking a significant milestone in what’s been a long and challenging post-Maria recovery journey. Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, told The Hill that he expected the remaining 25 customers to “receive electricity within the coming weeks.” On Monday afternoon, however, hours after the utility’s tweet, another large power outage was reported on the island. Local newspaper Caribbean Business reported that some 130,000 residents were left without electricity following the failure of a transmission line originating in the Costa Sur power complex in Guayanilla. CBS News reporter David Begnaud said Tuesday that power had been restored to the affected areas. Customers had been without power for under two hours, he said.

The cause: a tree, that had not been trimmed, made contact with a power line — David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) August 7, 2018 In an earlier tweet, however, Begnaud had pointed out the continuing problems of the island’s faltering grid. “As of now, [the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA)] says only 25 customers still don’t have [power]. On a side note, blackouts happen almost daily,” he wrote on Monday. Intermittent power has been a huge problem for Puerto Rico residents since Maria. In April, the entire island lost power in what’s been described as the second-largest blackout in history.

The utility faced intense backlash last year when it signed a $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings ― a small, Montana-based firm with just two employees ― to help with the island’s power restoration efforts. PREPA eventually backed away from the controversial contract. The sluggish pace of power restoration in Puerto Rico has been blamed for many post-Maria deaths. One example was the January death of Natalio Rodriguez Lebron, whose family told CNN that the 77-year-old died because they couldn’t afford to power a breathing machine that had kept him alive. Harvard researchers estimated earlier this year that almost 5,000 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria ― a number more than 70 times larger than the government’s official death toll of 64. More than 30 percent of households surveyed for the study said they’d struggled with interruptions to medical care after Maria. Ten percent of those impacted households said they’d been unable to use respiratory equipment because of a lack of electricity.

ABC News,"Interested in Hurricanes? Add Hurricanes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricanes news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Before the sun rose on the first day of 2018, someone called 911 to report the charred, bullet-riddled body of a man with a snake-like tattoo on his left hand, lying beside a road in the Puerto Rican town of Vega Baja. The next day, two men were found dead with their feet and hands bound in Bayamon, a working-class city southwest of the capital. Another man was shot to death before dawn in nearby Vega Baja while trying to stop thieves from stealing his generator. Thirty-two people have been slain in Puerto Rico in the first 11 days of the year, double the number killed over the same period in 2017. If the surge proves to be more than just a temporary blip, January could be the most homicidal month on the island in at least two years, adding a dangerous new element to the island's recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst disaster in decades. While the number of homicides did not immediately spike in the weeks after the hurricane struck on Sept. 20, police and independent experts say many killings appear at least partly related to its aftereffects. The storm has plunged much of the island into darkness, increased economic hardship and contributed to a sickout by police, all fueling lawlessness. What's more, officials say a turf war has broken out among drug gangs looking to grab territory after the storm's disruption. ""Hurricanes affect everyone, including criminals,"" said criminologist Jose Raul Cepeda. Already bankrupt, the island's overwhelmed government has fallen behind with millions of dollars in overtime payments owed to police officers, who have begun calling in sick in big numbers to protest. The sickout has taken about 2,000 police off the street each day in a territory that has 13,600 officers. It has forced more than a dozen police stations to close for several hours to a couple of days during the holiday period because of a lack of officers. No arrests have been made in the 32 killings this year. Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm, destroyed much of the island's electrical grid. For those police on duty, the streets are darker and more dangerous because power has been restored to only 60 percent of customers in the U.S. territory. Drug gangs are fighting to re-establish territory they lost in the disruption from Maria, which pushed thousands from their homes and left entire neighborhoods uninhabitable for weeks. Police Chief Michelle Hernandez resigned Monday after only a year on the job, and local and federal authorities are rushing from meeting to meeting to debate how to best protect 3.3 million Puerto Ricans, especially those still living in the dark. ""This has been devastating,"" said Ramon Santiago, a retiree who lives less than a block from where three bodies were discovered Sunday near a basketball court. ""You can't sleep peacefully in so much darkness."" Puerto Rico's homicide rate is roughly 20 killings per 100,000 residents, compared with 3.7 per 100,000 residents on the U.S. mainland. In the last two years, Puerto Rico has seen an average of 56 homicides a month, a rate that held through December. Then after New Year's, the killings started accelerating. A man was shot Jan. 3 by a security guard while trying to rob a bakery. Two double homicides were reported Jan. 8 — two men found shot to death in a car near an upscale resort on the north coast and two other men discovered sprawled on the street near a public housing complex on the west coast. Five killings alone were reported Monday, in addition to three people wounded by gunfire during a shootout that night in the parking lot of a strip mall in Bayamon. This week, police say, the son of a former judge was killed after trying to write down the license plate number of a car whose occupants were firing a gun. ""The lack of police is increasing Puerto Rico's safety issues,"" said legislator Denis Marquez, who was mugged at gunpoint last month. ""Everybody is feeling that insecurity."" Besides policing and getting the lights back on, he said, the government needs to address long-standing issues such as social inequality on an island with a 10 percent unemployment rate, where nearly 45 percent of its inhabitants lived in poverty before the hurricane. More immediately, the post-storm conditions have fueled a deadly struggle over drug gang territory, said Fernando Soler, vice president of a police officers' advocacy group. ""There's a war over the control for drugs,"" he told The Associated Press. ""They are taking advantage of all the situations occurring in Puerto Rico. There's no power and they believe there's a lack of police officers.... Criminals are taking care of business that was pending before the hurricane."" Inspector Elexis Torres heads a unit that is investigating eight homicides in a jurisdiction that includes the working-class city of Carolina near Puerto Rico's north coast, bordering the island's main airport. One of Puerto Rico's largest cities with nearly 160,000 people, Carolina had the triple homicide reported Sunday; a motel employee and a friend were found slain Tuesday in neighboring Trujillo Alto. Like nearly all the killings this year, they involve men in their 20s who were shot to death. Torres said he suspects both cases are drug related. He worries the number of killings will only increase as criminal gangs enter into cycles of revenge. ""Those victims likely belonged to some organization,"" Torres said of the triple homicide. ""This can have consequences."" Cepeda, the criminologist, said drug traffickers have been entering rival territories to increase sales and recover losses after the storm disrupted their business. Hurricane Maria caused an estimated $95 billion in damage, with 30,000-plus jobs lost in an economy that was already struggling from an 11-year-old recession. The last time Puerto Rico saw a spike in violent crime was in 2011, when a record 1,136 killings were reported on an island of nearly 4 million people. Puerto Rico had seen a drop in killings, to 700 in 2016 and 679 last year. Hector Pesquera, secretary of the newly created Department of Public Safety, met this week with top police officials and federal authorities. ""We're in a process of analysis and of committed work to fight criminality in Puerto Rico,"" he said. ——— Danica Coto on Twitter: https://twitter.com/danicacoto","Before the sun rose on the first day of 2018, someone called 911 to report the charred, bullet-riddled body of a man with a snake-like tattoo on his left hand, lying beside a road in the Puerto Rican town of Vega Baja.

Maria Popova,"Chance doesn’t deal happiness with an even hand — some lives are more weighed down by sorrow than others. It can be easy, and misguided, to romanticize suffering — despite Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s superb admonition against it, we have a long cultural history of perpetuating the “tortured genius” myth, the reality behind which is far more complex. What would it mean, instead, to orient ourselves toward sorrow neither with indulgence nor with self-pity, to regard it not as a malignancy of life but as part of its elemental richness? That is what Vincent van Gogh (March 30, 1853–July 29, 1890) addressed in a remarkable letter to his brother Theo, found in Ever Yours: The Essential Letters ( public library ) — the treasure trove that gave us Van Gogh on talking vs. doing and how inspired mistakes move us forward. ‘Self-Portrait with Straw Hat’ by Vincent van Gogh Despite his lifelong poverty, despite his debilitating mental illness, Van Gogh managed to transmute his various hardships into some of the most visionary art humanity has produced. During one particularly harrowing period of struggle, he writes to his brother in a letter from the Hague penned in mid-September 1883: You write about your walk to Ville-d’Avray that Sunday, at the same time on that same day I was also walking alone, and I want to tell you something about that walk, since then our thoughts probably crossed again in some degree. Van Gogh had set out on this particular walk in order to clear his head and his heart after finally splitting up with Sien — the alcoholic prostitute with whom he had fallen in love a year and a half earlier, just after recovering from the heartbreak that taught him how to turn unrequited love into fuel for art. It was a deeply ambivalent breakup — Van Gogh recognized that they couldn’t make each other happy in the long run, but he was deeply attached to Sien and her children, as was she to him. Seeking to quiet his mind, Van Gogh headed out “to talk to nature for a while.” From this turbulent inner state, he witnessed a violent storm which, paradoxically, reconciled him to his sorrow and helped him rediscover in it the elemental beauty of life. Vincent van Gogh: Pine Trees against an Evening Sky, 1889. (Van Gogh Museum) He recounts this transcendent encounter with nature to his brother: You know the landscape there, superb trees full of majesty and serenity beside green, dreadful, toy-box summer-houses, and every absurdity the lumbering imagination of Hollanders with private incomes can come up with in the way of flower-beds, arbours, verandas. Most of the houses very ugly, but some old and elegant. Well, at that moment, high above the meadows as endless as the desert, came one driven mass of cloud after the other, and the wind first struck the row of country houses with their trees on the opposite side of the waterway, where the black cinder road runs. Those trees, they were superb, there was a drama in each figure I’m tempted to say, but I mean in each tree. Then, the whole was almost finer than those windblown trees seen on their own, because the moment was such that even those absurd summer houses took on a singular character, rain-soaked and dishevelled. In it I saw an image of how even a person of absurd forms and conventions, or another full of eccentricity and caprice, can become a dramatic figure of special character if he’s gripped by true sorrow, moved by a calamity. It made me think for a moment of society today, how as it founders it now often appears like a large, sombre silhouette viewed against the light of reform. Writing half a century before before Rilke contemplated how great sadnesses bring us closer to ourselves, Van Gogh adds: Yes, for me the drama of a storm in nature, the drama of sorrow in life, is the best… Oh, there must be a little bit of air, a little bit of happiness, but chiefly to let the form be felt, to make the lines of the silhouette speak. But let the whole be sombre. Vincent Van Gogh: Landscape in Stormy Weather, 1885. (Van Gogh Museum) Seven years later, the drama of sorrow disfigured the silhouette of Van Gogh’s life. Complement this fragment of Van Gogh’s deeply alive Essential Letters with French philosopher Simone Weil — one of the most luminous and underappreciated minds of the twentieth century — on how to make use of our suffering, then revisit Nicole Krauss’s beautiful letter to Van Gogh across space and time about fear, courage, and how to break our destructive patterns.","""Oh, there must be a little bit of air, a little bit of happiness, but chiefly to let the form be felt, to make the lines of the silhouette speak. But let the whole be sombre.""",2018-08-22T06:00:03Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Brainpickings.org'}","Van Gogh on the Beauty of Sorrow and the Enchantment of Storms, in Nature and in Life",https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/08/22/van-gogh-sorrow/,https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/vangogh_pinetree0.jpg?fit=600%2C315&ssl=1,,Brainpickings.org,storm complex,1
Alice Bonasio,"The holidays bring that familiar mixture of anticipation and dread that comes with traveling at the busiest time of the year. And this year passengers have even more reason to feel trepidation as they head out to the airport, even if they’re not flying with United. Hundreds of American Airlines passengers recently discovered that a computer glitch had jeopardized their holiday plans. In September, Ryanair also experienced a similar failure that led to a much larger scheduling meltdown, affecting over 700,000 passengers and causing no fewer than 20,000 flight cancellations. Ryanair has since gone on to hire more than 200 pilots, capitalizing in part on the collapse of some of its competitors – such as Monarch Airlines – but critics point to the fact that more staff won’t solve the flaws that led to the fiasco in the first place. So why don’t the airlines simply implement new solutions to optimize their operations? Tom LaJoie, the president of airline crew and flight schedule management firm eTT Aviation, says that the aviation industry is notoriously conservative and generally loathe to make changes to its mission-critical structures. “Their operational systems have many tentacles into other systems, and those interfaces must be updated with a new system,” he explains. “Some airlines get caught in a situation of waiting too long to upgrade their systems due to costs and complexities of the implementation phase.” Watching all those scenes of miserable passengers stranded at airports, and given the industry’s resistance to change, you’d be forgiven for thinking that airlines are in crisis. And yet, profits are actually expected to hit record levels in 2018, and global passenger numbers are up by 6 percent on average. So the more immediate crisis facing the airline industry is keeping up with demand among rising concerns about crewing shortages. According to a Boeing report, at current rates of growth airlines would need to recruit and train around 600,000 new pilots over the next 20 years – over 253,000 in the Asia Pacific region alone. Expansion in China and elsewhere is indeed putting pressure on established markets like Europe, and aviation groups broadly agree that recruitment is going to become increasingly challenging as the prospect of pilot shortages looms. Add to this the fact that 42% of current US pilots will retire over the next decade, and that new regulations brought in by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have limited pilot flight time in an effort to reduce fatigue-induced errors, and you have something of a perfect storm brewing which could be bad news for passengers. So it doesn’t come as much of a surprise that research conducted by investment bank UBS found growing momentum to develop technologies which would allow aircraft to be flown remotely. At this rate, the study claims, pilotless planes could be possible by 2025 Autonomous flight is already being tested and conceptualized, in fact. Lilium Aviation recently tested its all-electric, two-seater, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) prototype, while Airbus recently completed a successful test of Sagitta, an uncrewed aerial vehicle, which flew autonomously for seven minutes on a pre-programmed course in Overberg, South Africa. “In the not-too-distant future, we would expect to see a situation where flights are pilotless or the number of pilots shrinks to one, with a remote pilot based on the ground and highly secure ground-to-air communications,” the UBS study claimed, saying the changes would eventually make flying safer by minimizing human cockpit errors, as well as bringing peripheral efficiencies in terms of fuel gains through optimized operations, for instance. Paul Eremenko, Chief Technology Officer at Airbus, recently said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that the company is already pursuing single-pilot operation as a potential option, but doesn’t rule out going even further: “A lot of the technologies needed to make that happen have also put us on the path towards unpiloted operation.” These companies are spurred by the promise that such technology could potentially save the industry an estimated $30 billion over the next two decades. Yet on the other hand, unmanned cockpits pose obvious security concerns around hacking and glitches, not to mention removing the ability of a human pilot to deal with unexpected emergency situations on board. So even though such a move could save passengers as much as 10 per cent on the cost of their fares, 54 per cent of the 8,000 respondents surveyed by UBS said they would be unlikely to board a pilotless flight. “While it is true fully automated flight will be possible in commercial passenger operations, the public’s willingness to travel on such aircraft will likely be a bigger obstacle to its full implementation than mastering the technology itself,” notes eTT’s LaJoie. In his view, the investment in autonomous passenger travel is a “a very long play,” and might even prove something of a distraction for airlines that should be focusing on upgrading their existing systems to make them more intelligent and dynamic. “Automated tools are particularly important now, not just for regulatory reasons, but because the shortage of pilots – particularly at regional airlines – necessitates scheduling each pilot for maximum utilizations and efficiency within regulatory boundaries,” he says. LaJoie’s company specializes in flight schedule management, taking into account a complex set of variables including crew readiness and vessel location to maximize pilot availability. Their complex data solution, powered by the Sisense business intelligence platform, helps schedulers on the ground to work with crewmembers to solve problems before they become large enough to cause delays or cancellations. Much like the broader debate around driverless cars, automation is not a silver bullet that will solve the industry’s problems. And although greater use of big data analytics and AI will inevitably play a large part in building the future mobility mix, it is not necessarily about replacing humans, but about empowering them to be more efficient and productive in their jobs. Even though overhauling logistics and improving business intelligence may not sound as sexy as autonomous flying cars, there is a case for addressing the improvement and integration of existing systems infrastructure, as these can potentially yield the greatest returns for both industry and passengers.","The airline industry is investing heavily in pilotless planes, but should it be fixing existing systems first?

Levi King,"Tell me if you've ever been here before. You've just put in a 15-hour day at the office and now you're home among familiar comforts like your flat-screen TV and fully stocked refrigerator. It's finally time to take time for yourself. But then you think: ""Shoot, it's almost midnight and I have to be up at 5 a.m. to [fill in the blank with some small, simple, soul-destroying task necessary to keep a small business operating ]."" So, you go to straight to bed. You hurry to dreamland for five hours of stress-free rest. But instead, you dream about work. Those emails you haven't answered. That little tiff between two of your best employees which might end up with both of them leaving your employ. This isn't healthful, to put it bluntly. The problem isn't that you're obsessive about your job--entrepreneurs are obsessive by definition. But you've got to find methods of escaping those demands, even if only for a few minutes now and then. You owe it to yourself, your company and your loved ones to do so. A few humble suggestions: 1. Read a book. No, an actual book. This advice is hypocritical, because I've given away most of my old-fashioned books over the years as I've moved from place to place. The beauty of having a traditional library isn't worth the back pain. These days, I do most of my reading from my Kindle or my phone--but my point holds true regardless. Reading takes you out of yourself in a manner that few other activities can. What you read matters. Scanning some article from the Drudge Report or CNN is probably going to leave you depressed, scared, and wishing that the internet had never been invented. Instead, dig into a longform essay or book that demands steadfast attention and commitment. Ashlee Vance's biography of Elon Musk, for example. Think you know all there is to know about the guy whose ambitions include colonizing Mars and building an underground freeway system? Think again. You just can't capture someone that complex in a headline. Hell, Vance hardly scratches the surface in 400-plus pages. But I was mesmerized for every single page, and my blood pressure was grateful for the break. 2. Love the people you love with your whole self. I have six daughters, all of whom live at home. They're all energetic, too--picture a lightning storm at an outdoor monster truck rally and you'll get the idea. When I walk through the front door, I get mobbed. I get mobbed by six little people, each of whose needs, goals and crises are--to them--every bit as complex as Elon Musk's. You'd think, in a sane world, that this wouldn't exactly count as a de-stressor, but it does. It isn't answering emails. It isn't solving spats between talented colleagues. It's connecting emotionally with human beings for whom I'd die in a heartbeat. They take me out of myself. They make me laugh. Hell, even if they make me cry, it's different from the sort of tears an unsuccessful fundraise might inspire. It's the difference between turning on a light bulb and watching a sunrise. Both provide light, but one lights a room, and the other the world. Decide who lights up your world, and pay attention to them. You'll not just survive, but thrive. 3. Take care of yours truly, truly. Again, I have to preface this suggestion with a hypocrisy warning: I work too many hours, travel too many miles, and drink too many glasses of wine to qualify for healthiest man of the year. I do hit the gym on a daily basis, even if it's just for 20 minutes. I visit my doctor and heed his advice. I stopped eating sugary treats when I realized they were killing me. In short, I make enough tiny sacrifices on behalf of my body and mind to sustain my existence without too much discomfort for either. Excessive physical or mental distress will eventually lead to failure--failure in business, failure at home, failure at everything that matters. Babying yourself every once in a while doesn't make you a baby. Limited suffering on a treadmill will save you unlimited suffering down the road. I'm a devotee of massages--I found an affordable establishment and establish my presence there at least once a week. None of these suggestions are revolutionary or original. They're bedrock stuff, basic stuff, but they've saved me a lot of grief. So try it. Open a book at page one and keep going until there are no more pages to turn. Open your heart to someone your heart belongs to, and let them do the same. And pick up a dumbbell, for God's sake. No, not for God's, for yours.","Entrepreneurship demands a lot of its practitioners. But ""a lot"" doesn't have to mean ""everything.""

Matt Cox,"If you’ve ever looked at your pet in Diablo III and thought “it’s a shame that’s not a miniature version of a high-tech flying battleship”, then I’ve got some good news. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of StarCraft ‘s release, Blizzard are giving out some free bits and bobs for StarCraft: Remastered, StarCraft II, Diablo, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone. You play at least one of those games, right? I find something undeniably icky about the phrase “cross-franchise celebration”, despite having no real objections to what it entails. Maybe it’s just that in whatever context it crops up, I can’t help but recoil at the f-word. Ok, I’ve un-recoiled – let’s see what we have here. Stacraft: Remastered and StarCraft II are receiving retro UI skins, along with some new player profile portraits for the latter. Those will both become available tomorrow, as will a Sarah Kerrigan Ghost skin for Overwatch’s Widowmaker and a delightfully incongruous Battlecruiser pet for Diablo III. On March 21st you can get three Kobold and Catacombs card packs for Hearthstone. Then on March 27th, if your insatiable appetite for classic StarCraft player profile portraits hasn’t been appeased, you can get some of those for Heroes of the Storm. Finally from March 31st, if you can track down one of the StarCraft pets that already exist in WoW and salute it, you’ll get one of those fancy “Feat of Strength” achievements. You can get all of the other rewards just by booting up the relevant game. You’ll also have to wait until March 31st for a documentury called “StarCraft is Life: A Celebration”, in which “some of StarCraft’s biggest fans look back on their favorite memories from the past 20 years.” Perhaps of more interest than the freebies is the flurry of articles that Blizzard have featured as part of their anniversary celebrations. There are interviews with esports types and developers, but the headline that caught my eye was “ Checking in with the DeepMind StarCraft II team “. DeepMind is Google’s ongoing attempt to build an artificial general intelligence – an AI that can teach itself to accomplish almost any complex task. DeepMind made headlines last year when their “Alpha Go” AI beat renowned Go champion Lee Sedol, though researcher Oriol Vinyals is less confident about DeepMind’s chances against top StarCraft players. “What I like about our approach is that, if it all works out, the agent has learned a very large variety of tactics and counters that couldn’t possibly be programmed, in the same way you couldn’t program a very good Go player. In terms of beating the very best — I don’t know. That’s to be seen. I cannot predict whether we will be able to beat them or not.” I reckon he’s just being modest.","If you’ve ever looked at your pet in Diablo III and thought “it’s a shame that’s not a miniature version of a high-tech flying battleship”, then I’ve got some good news.

Tim Stone,"When it comes to modelling courage and its wholly logical antithesis, cowardice, wargame devs are a conservative bunch. A morale test here, a leadership bonus there… why innovate or illuminate when you can follow and fudge. Very few delve into the complex psychology of the warrior as deeply as Green Tree Games, the makers of Burden of Command, or shun the subject with such baffling determination as Creative Storm Entertainment, the folk behind Age of Gladiators II: Rome. Having found the original Age of Gladiators (pictured above) too dry for my taste and Domina (pictured below) too hectic, I had high hopes for AoG2. A history-steeped gladiator management sim with turnbased strategic and tactical layers, Creative Storm’s latest looked, from the hard seats in the maenianum secundum in legneis, like a perfect companion for dear old Qvadriga. After a day’s play I knew better, but wasn’t so disenchanted that I instantly abandoned Terry, Barry, Colin and the rest of my bescabbed sword swingers. It’s hard to fault the game’s lanista component. Hiring fighters and buying slaves, equipping them, training them, improving your ludus… inter-aggro activities are varied and absorbing if visually underwhelming (there’s no graphical representation of your facilities, for example). In addition to your arena artistes you also employ scouts, doctors, trainers and equipment technicians, all of whom come with their own modest sets of influential stats. Gladiators positively bristle with numbers and traits. The majority determine how likely they are to land blows (or parry or dodge them) and inflict damage, but there are also attributes that bestow character and impact popularity, financial decisions, and extra-curricular activities. The morale of a greedy glad will decrease rapidly unless you’re generous when splitting fight purses. A school full of virtuous duelists will seriously restrict your options when it comes to optional side missions, many of which involve skullduggery. In AoG2’s management portion, turns represent single days. As building projects take months to complete and employees don’t need constant babysitting, often its possible to hurry through fightless days the next without altering anything. Although a lanista has no control over bout timing, format or foes, they do get to select warriors and forfeit scraps – a useful option when opponents look formidable or key fighters are sick or recuperating. Developing duelists without exhausting, exasperating or extinguishing them is, of course, the name of the game. Chances are, a few hours into your first career you’ll find your morgue and hospital overflowing, and your barracks half empty because of escapes and resignations. Whether you restart or soldier with help from a local moneylender is up to you. Fame is the primary spur in the long game. Victories and purchased assets like vineyards and seaside villas generate it, eventually allowing you to move to roomier premises in a larger, more fashionable city. As in Football: Tactics and Glory, careers have natural momentum, the promise of success in the next five-minute contest helping to expunge memories of defeat in the last. What a pity the two games are worlds apart when it comes to tactical layer appeal. Far too often the IGOUGO clashes in AoG2 boil down to fighters standing in adjacent hexagons doggedly slashing the sherbet out of each other. In terms of melee orders there are basically just three, and two of those simply reduce or raise the hit chance in return for increased/reduced damage. If suitably equipped or qualified, gladiators can also use action points to toss blinding handfuls of sand, bolt healing or performance-enhancing herbs, and execute a few other buffs, but once within sword range it’s essentially hit and hope, hit and hope, hit and hope, until one party crumples into the dust. Busier arenas make for slightly more interesting skirmishes. When there are four or more fighters in the mix you need to prioritise and focus, and there are reasons to manoeuvre. It’s not nearly enough though. Right now Age of Gladiators 2: Rome is a rich, interesting management sim manacled to an impoverished, dull tactical wargame. Special moves and attacks, courage simulation, dropped weapons, reasons to study an opponent before launching an attack… it’s not hard to picture improvements that could, if implemented intelligently, make Age of Gladiators III the game its predecessor really should have been. Age of Gladiators 2: Rome is available now, priced £14 (£15.50 from August 28th) * * * “The dark world of the battlefield is hard to analyze even for those who have been on it. We don’t claim to have the experience right, but we do hope we’re at least interesting about it”. No-one could accuse Luke Hughes, the driving force behind upcoming “tactical leadership RPG” Burden of Command, of overclaiming. Listening to him qualify and downplay, you might not guess that Green Tree’s debut title, thanks to a strong reality-rooted narrative and heavy emphasis on psychology, relationships, and characterisation, promises to be one of the most human and thought-provoking tactical wargames yet made. Burden of Command will bend the truth from the time, but the manipulation will be done reluctantly and carefully. Luke talked of the game’s occasional white lies while walking me through the WIP combat mechanisms at the heart of this recent ‘tactical teaser’ video: – – – – Shock Attacks – – – – Luke: Did you notice that when the StuG appears the GIs immediately show some suppression (Reduction of their morale attribute reducing their effectiveness as their heads go down. It may lead to either panic or ignored orders) despite that fact that no shots were fired. We call this a “shock attack”. Brains and Bullets (also titled War Games: The Psychology of Combat) calls it “weapon push”. The idea is that it is demoralizing to know the other side has weapons you can’t currently match. Here your GIs don’t have armor and the Germans do. Result: suppression. I’ve been told something similar happens when a dragon shows up in Total War: Warhammer! Except for GIs it was for real. Sobering. There’s a nice example of how the Brits got wise to explicitly using shock attacks in WWII in Brains and Bullets. Trooper Brooks, a British soldier, describing the advance into Germany in 1945: “Before anybody got in range, the Crocodiles would fire off a few jets of flame to let Jerry know what was coming and then they’d walk with the infantry up to the edge of town. Meantime Jerry was having a quick chat about their prospects, and ten-to-one they’d be waving bed sheets before the Crocs got in range. … Didn’t matter who they were: SS, paratroops, it didn’t matter. Once they’d had the carrot and the stick waved at them, they packed it in. Then we’d all have a brew and a fag before heading off to round up the next lot.” This kind of morale shock from a mismatch in weaponry has been going on a long time. A quote from the fine WWI treatise Battle Leadership by Captain Adolf Von Schell (later a Panzer Division commander in WWII) who gave talks to the USMC between the wars: “[WWI: 1916] The Russians had been firing for hours, but our artillery didn’t reply. I went constantly from dugout to dugout to see and speak to my men. They should at least see that they were not alone. Repeatedly they asked me: “Are we really entirely alone here; haven’t we any artillery?” It continued this way for hours. Our telephone wires had been shot to pieces. Finally a tremendous noise came from our rear. Our own artillery was firing. At once high spirits returned.” But wait, don’t get too hopeful! We’re not going to hand you a lot of flame tanks or you’ll just wipe the floor with our scenarios. The Cottonbalers mostly didn’t have armor support. – – – – Press and Stress – – – – Lieutenant Wilson’s squad is “spent”, that is, they have already been ordered for the turn and can’t be given further actions. But now Wilson has a crisis on his hands with a larger German assault heading his way. He responds by “pressing” a squad of his company to give them another action so they can get to cover. But the side effect is long term stress. To be frank, this is a bit Hollywood. Stress psychologically and neurophysiologically comes from continued exposure to threats, especially threats you can do little about). Also from traumatic events like casualties of friends. In the military world we recognize it in its advanced form as shell shock (WWI), combat fatigue (WWII), or PTSD (today). Whether “pressing” stresses… who knows, but it is thematic and puts the player in the position of trading off short term benefit (get the hell out of there) vs long term (stressing troops). We always prioritize a good gameplay experience (otherwise just go read a book!) but we also try not to break history. So stress will be an important part of managing your men. They will accumulate stress mostly from simply being under fire or seeing casualties, but “press” will also generate it directly. In WWII the US army realized that given enough exposure to combat everyone eventually broke. Unfortunately, for manpower shortage reasons they felt they could typically not rotate infantrymen out of the line (Germans did manage this more BTW). Though they would try to put them on quieter fronts to recover (Ardennes 1944 anyone?). The take away for you in Burden of Command is given enough time and enough exposure of your best officers and squads to combat you will find you have to manage their stress across the campaign (Darkest Dungeon led the way here as well as Dan Verssen’s leadership board games ). You didn’t think using the best and brightest all the time would come free did you? The gameplay effect of stress will be that stressed leaders and squads are brittle. They will overreact to threats. Incoming fire that might suppress only two points out of an average 10 morale unit might suppress a stressed unit four points. So experienced but stressed squads and officers become glass cannons requiring careful management. Do it enough and your Lts may ultimately break within the narrative. You have been warned! – – – – Bolster and Assault – – – – Lt Thompson is going to lead an assault. He needs to do a short-term pump of their morale (“Follow me!”) to increase the odds that they’ll follow. In gameplay terms “bolster” pumps morale but only for one action. Contrast a “rally” (remember Lt Dearborn facing the German armor?) which achieves a long-term morale boost at the cost of using up the rallied squad for the turn. Leaders like Dearborn add human drama to combat but really were they that important? The short answer is “very.” One statistical analysis suggests that of their own volition a squad will perhaps assault 20% of the time. After all, who wants to fight hand to hand? In WWI they called it “fear of the bayonet.” A highly trusted leader, whether NCO or officer, can raise this chance to as much as 70%. In game terms, if you order a squad to assault without a “bolster” there’s a fair chance that the men “won’t quite hear you”. But should you lead by example they’ll likely follow. Why are Lts doing all the key bolstering when truly it was the NCOs (Corporals, Sergeants etc) who were the Morale backbone? Here we have to plead Hollywood (i.e. game design) again. We focus on key officers to reduce the number of dials you have to turn. We do this not only for simplicity but to increase the chances you’ll empathize with the small band of NPCs who are your “direct reports”. Some beautiful examples of leadership courage can be found in John McManus’s account of the fighting at Omaha Beach ( The Dead and Those About to Die ). Beautiful at a distance, but in practice the casualty rates among US junior officers in WWII were shockingly high. “Follow me” comes at a high personal price, a fact reflected in Burden of Command with permadeath. – – Heroic but Green (or Failing to Obey the Four Fs) – – There’s a lot to admire in the personal courage of Lt Thompson leading the direct assault on the unsuppressed German MG. Less admirable is the standard of tactical leadership on show. There’s a reason Thompson dies at the end. Assaulting unsuppressed MGs, or even an unsuppressed enemy infantry squad, is an excellent way to perish quickly. In Burden of Command if you lead your men across open ground against an unsuppressed MG you will probably have a short career, your men will likely take very high casualties, and the assault will probably fail. Maybe to get this across in the teaser we should have had exactly that happen. But perhaps that would have been a little too much of a downer for a teaser. Ah hindsight, who can say? So what should Lt Thompson have done? We couldn’t really give a primer on the “4Fs” in a two-minute video but, for future refrence, it’s: Find, Fix, Flank, and Finish. Specifically, Thompson should have first suppressed (“Fixed”) the German MG with both rifle fire and, assuming they were available, friendly MGs and mortar. After fixing he should then have flanked. Anyone interested in military history knows how important flanking is. Brains and Bullets views it as the single most powerful factor besides leadership and firepower. In Burden of Command terms if you are out of the front arc of the enemy unit when you arrive adjacent, not only will the foe not return fire, but they will suffer a morale check which will likely lead to them surrendering. As an aside, actual hand to hand melees in WWII were relatively rare. That’s why the teaser showed a surrender. It’s so often about morale and not brute force. Fear of the bayonet. – – – – What’s Missing? – – – – Of course there are many critical elements of Burden of Command not shown in the teaser. Command Points, “Push Your Luck”, battlefield friction, combined arms tactics, the importance of cover and stance, how troops “habituate” to repeated fire… Perhaps the most important omission is Fog of War. We all know how unpleasant it is in any military game to stumble into a undetected unit. Burden of Command will be no different. FOW was very intense in WWII. GIs were often shocked by the absence of any visible enemy on the battlefield (while still being shot at). Still on the drawing board is whether there will be explicit scouting actions for squads or leaders. We definitely plan for more experienced units to develop a sixth sense (better spotting). Several of the combat experienced vets amongst our team and testers have emphasized that certain individuals really do develop this. Thanks for letting me prattle on about a subject I am deeply fascinated by – namely, how people react under the deep stress of combat (go listen to some Hardcore History podcasts to hear some amazing real world combat stories). In closing, I want to re-emphasize that first and foremost we want Burden of Command to be an engaging game. We will bend realism and history where we must to achieve that. But we’ll try hard not to break it! * * *","When it comes to modelling courage and its wholly logical antithesis, cowardice, wargame devs are a conservative bunch.

"USA TODAY, Kristin Lam, USA TODAY","Whipping Santa Ana winds are playing a huge role in how quickly the Thomas Fire is spreading across Ventura County, California. Fire officials say it's a ""very bad scenario."" USA TODAY Charred remains of the Thomas Fire (Photo: Lauren Keskinel) The winds notorious for fueling Southern California wildfires were expected to kick up for the first time this year on Sunday night, putting the region on alert, according to the National Weather Service. The season's first major Santa Ana winds may reach gusts of up to 75 mph in the region's mountains, creating critical fire weather conditions through Tuesday night. Last year, the winds drove the Thomas Fire, which destroyed more than 280,000 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. and took more than a month to contain. Before the Mendocino Complex Fire in Northern California surpassed it this summer, the Thomas Fire was the largest wildfire in the state's modern history. The fire warnings cover parts of Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Strong winds, low relative humidity and warm temperatures can combine to fuel life and property-threatening fires. In Los Angeles and Ventura counties especially, gusts of 45 to 65 mph will dry out fuel made wet by recent rainfall, according to the advisory. Minimum humidities between 4 and 12 percent Monday and Tuesday and temperatures reaching 81 to 91 degrees will also create dry, hot air that could rapidly spread fires. Any fires could start spot fires far ahead of the main body of flames and behave erratically, reported the Ventura County Star, part of the USA TODAY Network. Related: 'Beyond a perfect storm': Wind-driven California fire nears record Related: After the fire comes the bill: The rising cost of fighting California blazes The weather service advised the public to use caution near fire-ignition sources, noting the potential for rapid fire growth and extreme fire behavior. Sudden gusty cross winds may also make driving difficult and cause power outages. People should stay away from downed trees and power lines, the Los Angeles forecast office tweeted. The Santa Ana winds, which are most common from September through May, drive dry air from over the inland deserts of California and the Southwest. They blow over mountains between the state's coast and desert areas, compressing and warming up. The relative humidity of the warming air then drops, drying out vegetation and making prime fuel for wildfires.

Verge Staff,"We saw a lot of wild stuff this year, from the future of electric cars, holograms, and our planet, to the future of... banana phones. As we take a (short) break before January’s Consumer Electronics Show, here’s a look back on Verge Video’s favorite projects of 2017. - Tom Connors April 9th: The sound of movie monsters This video all started with a heated convo at lunch between me, audio engineer Andru Marino, and science editor Ale Potenza: two Jurassic Park fanatics versus me. We really leaned into sound. Andru, our sound engineer, would edit first, as if it were a podcast, and then I would drop footage. We also watched Jurassic Park movies on the weekend... for research. - Alix Diaconis April 18th: Galaxy S8 Review The wallpaper we made for our Samsung Galaxy S8 Review has gone on to become one of our most memorable graphics. During a pre-production conversation with James Bareham, our Creative Director, we agreed it would be great to have a wallpaper that helps show off the curved edges of the S8. With the broad idea of “lines”, I sat down, created the design, and after seeing it we suddenly realized: why haven’t we been doing this all along? We make custom wallpapers for for a majority of our reviews, which are available to download here. Bonus: a tutorial on how I made the wallpaper can be found here. - William Joel June 5th: Walt Mossberg’s gadget museum This was a series we always wanted to do at some point, and there was no better time than around Walt Mossberg’s retirement. I was lucky to get to work with Walt every week on our podcast Ctrl-Walt-Delete, so they let me edit some of these videos. As a fan of retro tech, this was a really cool way to show how some of the more recognized gadgets in his collection were inspiration for the phones, laptops, and tablets we use today; as well as shine a light on how a cultural status symbol was developing around consumer technology. The StarTAC made you look cool, the Kindle made Amazon a hardware company, the TRS-80 refined word processing, the IBM Thinkpad 701 refined that even further, and the iPhone, of course, changed the way we live in more ways than one. - Andru Marino June 19th: Making the OnePlus 5 As a longtime nerd and fan of The Verge, technology runs in my blood. When asked if I would go to Shenzhen, China to shoot a feature with OnePlus, I had my bag packed by the first planning meeting. We spent a week in China’s tech capital, where my inner geek shined from the OnePlus factory floor to Shenzhen’s insane electronics market, Huaqiangbei. It was without a doubt a trip to remember, and I can’t wait to make it back to China for another video. - Phil Esposito (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.11'; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); Microsoft's Calibri font is at the center of a political scandal A Microsoft font may have exposed corruption in Pakistan. Posted by The Verge on Friday, July 14, 2017 July 15th: A Microsoft font gets the last laugh My favorite videos were joyful to work on because they were all inherently editorial, rather that keeping up with a Facebook Views rat race of virality. A video that sticks out as cementing a news format was, “A Microsoft font may have exposed corruption in Pakistan.” It builds off the work we’d been doing with Russell Brandom in videos such as the Petrya Ransomware news hit, and gave us the room to focus on more editorial stories such as AI Fake News and one of my favorites from Circuit Breaker, Gadget Myth-busting: Should you cover your webcam? - Sarah Bishop Woods August 3rd: Moto Z2 Force Review The Moto Z2 Force is one of the most unimpressive, wildly boring phones I have had the pleasure of shooting this year, but even a donkey can look like a stallion in the summer months when the content lakes are dry and companies are putting the final touches on more impressive tech. We shot the hell out of this phone, but ultimately just wanted an excuse to buy glitter. Enjoy! - Becca Farsace August 15th: Space Craft, Episode 1 Most of my time is spent keeping The Verge’s video machine running (aka operations aka meetings) and that means I don't often get to be hands on with videos. Space Craft, however, was an exception, and this episode in particular was a lot of fun to pull together. We had a last minute opportunity to send the crew to North Dakota to run around in spacesuits, and how do you say ‘no’ to that? A lot of different people on the video team worked on this series in one way or another — and more than once I found myself sitting in the edit suite marveling at how lucky I am to work with this team and all the work we do. - Sophie Erickson August 29th: Microgravity One of my favorite things about creating videos for The Verge is getting the chance to experience the lives of some of the world's most interesting people. Every shoot is like a walk in someone else's shoes. On Space Craft, these shoes were moon boots, and they did not disappoint. Just being at NASA was incredible, and I can now check the box next to the childhood dream of going to space camp. We got to see a spaceship. We toured the astronaut training facilities, and Loren learned how to exercise on space. We met and filmed with two astronauts as they completed an underwater simulation in a giant pool with replica space crafts. I mean, what is life? - Tyler Pina (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.11'; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); All the ways you're wearing contact lenses wrong | Bad Habits Your bad contact lens habits could make you go blind. Posted by Verge Science on Wednesday, November 1, 2017 November 1st: Bad habits As low-key as this video is, everyone sacrificed something for it. Our very patient coworkers gave up an office bathroom so that we’d have a place to film. Reporter Angela Chen spent the better part of the afternoon repeatedly poking at her own eyes. And the authentic bloodshot eye in the opening shot? That’s director Alex Parkin, who grabbed the wrong prop bottle of contact solution and ended up with some mild hydrogen peroxide burns. Buy hey, we got a good shot, and after a couple hours Alex got his sight back too. In conclusion: watch the video. Treat your eyes well.

Robots might start mining gold from the seafloor — but will it destroy rare species? Posted by Verge Science on Tuesday, November 7, 2017 November 7th: Deep sea vents Deep Sea Vents was the first video the Science team produced using a miniature. Some topics that we cover are hard to visualize or find original footage of, but we took that as a challenge to create our own underwater vent. Using a 12”x12” aquarium, cement, a 200ml cooking syringe, plastic tubing, an air pump, white tempera paint, and glitter, we shot slow motion macro shots as the paint was injected through the vent column and into the water, creating a beautiful white plume. Each shot took approximately thirty minutes to set up, so we only were able to capture a few shots before it was time to wrap up and move on — but the process was extremely fun and we hope to continue building miniatures and dioramas as we explore other video topics. - Cory Zapatka November 8th: Hurricane homes Hurricane Harvey devastated coastal towns in Texas and the aftermath was surreal. I met folks that rode out the storm and lived to tell about it thanks to the design of their Deltec home. The timing to tell this story felt right. We had just seen most of the south get pummeled by hurricanes and climate change discussions were front and center. As a Director, my goal is to find the “human element” in stories and form connections between the subject and the audience. My hope is to spark conversations, inform, and entertain. - Christian Mazza November 14th: Next Level drone detection I’ve been tasked with the Next Level graphics for two seasons now and this one stands out more than any other. The series has many strong animations throughout it but what stood out here is the drones, I’ve always found them to be intriguing. Being able to recreate one and how they move in a 2d environment was a welcoming challenge. - Garret Beard (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.11'; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); The psychology of self-driving cars Why don't we trust self-driving cars? Posted by Verge Science on Tuesday, November 28, 2017 November 28th: Self driving cars, how do they work? My 8-year-old self would be thrilled to know that one day he’d get paid to play with toy cars. I locked myself in the studio, threw on some tunes, and set up scenarios for the little cars to act out. The only thing missing were the Squeezits. And I think that sense of nostalgia found its way into the visual style of the video, my inspirations included Carl Sagan’s Flatland and a Blockbuster training video. William Poor’s script was a fun, introductory look at a very complex topic, and it was fun trying to reflect it visually. - Alex Parkin November 22nd: Microsoft’s weird hardware It was my first week on the job and I was asked to hop on a plane and help out. Dieter had a hands on with the new Surface Book, but we were also offered access to design and engineering leads who could show us around their in house hardware lab. It was a hectic few hours, but in the best possible way. We knew there was a story, but we walked in listening letting ourselves to hear where that story was hiding. Working with Vjeran to capture the visuals and Dieter to craft a thoughtful and original story proved to me that this is the place that I want to be. So this piece is pretty special to me. - Felicia Shivakumar December 5th: Exosuits The easiest part of my job is making Lauren Goode look like a rockstar, and it was especially easy when she was testing out exoskeletons in the season two finale of Next Level. Aside from experiencing the tech, myself included, filming this episode was a blast -- slow motion footage, dramatic lighting, Movi shots, sound effects, trip to Detroit... you name it! And another point of pride was the amount of research and journalism that went into telling this story. We talked to industry leaders, pioneers and beta testers for both medical and industrial uses. It serves as a great evergreen piece about the current state and future of exos. Besides, you don't get an opportunity to shoot on the floor of Ford's assembly plant, or operate the gimbal wearing an exoskeleton. - Vjeran Pavic","From movie monsters, to deep sea vents and outer space, we visited the outer limits",2017-12-29T14:36:42Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",2017: The year in Verge video,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/29/16829350/2017-the-year-in-verge-video,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_RmATETQR95KzBfyr-RJTGr-Fsw=/0x0:4032x2111/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9944747/img_20171218_200518.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,storm complex,1
Megan Geuss,"reader comments 0 One Strange Rock trailer, National Geographic. If you work or live in a city, it’s easy to forget how powerful and delicate nature is. Even if you do get quality outdoor time on a regular basis, it’s hard to hold in your mind how this dichotomy of strength and vulnerability expands across the globe, connected by systems of air, water, and sunlight that tie the whole planet into a single complex system. But the National Geographic Channel has just the antidote to our collective myopia. A 10-episode series called One Strange Rock debuts tonight at 10ET/9CT, and if you get that channel, it’s worth checking out. The series is a detailed look at some of the Earth’s macro- and micro-scale bio-systems that keep our tiny planet alive. It's a lot like Neil DeGrasse Tyson's Cosmos, but strictly with an Earth focus. One of One Strange Rock 's interesting twists is that a lot of this ecology lesson comes from former astronauts, including Chris Hadfield, Mae Jemison, Peggy Whitson, Jerry Linenger, and more. Though it may not seem like an obvious choice to everyone, telling the story of life on Earth through the voices of the only people who have left Earth works perfectly. The astronaut narration was a bit of serendipity, according to Executive Producer Jane Root. (Root, for context, is the former president of the Discovery Channel and has since founded her own studio, Nutopia, which specializes in TV-documentaries.) As the team was working on how to build this series, someone asked if there would be a narrator. “It was a huge breakthrough to use astronauts,"" she said. “[During pre-production], someone we were working with had the idea of astronauts, and she said, 'I had this idea, it might be mad but…’” Everyone behind the scenes of One Strange Rock loved the suggestion, however. And as a viewer, it really does skillfully change the show's trajectory. ""The poisonous tentacles of a Man of War jellyfish wait patiently for a small fish to swim by for it to prey on and kill quickly with its venom."" ""Macro shot of excreting leaves."" ""Diatom Bloom in Arctic waters."" ""The Hawaii Space Exploration Analogue and Simulation (HISEAs) research project sits on the slopes of Mauna Loa, a volcano in Hawaii. The NASA-funded Mars analog study researches how people can live and work in isolation for long periods of time. Crew members must live as they would on Mars and can't go outside without wearing protective suits. ""Bacteria can be found everywhere, but corrosion science professor Ian MacLeod is specifically interested in the bacteria breaking down the shipwrecks in the Chuuk lagoon in Micronesia. The economy of Chuuk Lagoon is based on its wreck diving tourism, so Prof MacLeod hopes his work will one day save lives by predicting when the wrecks will collapse. ""Scientists walking through an acidic landscape."" ""Scientists walking through an acidic landscape from above."" ""Scientists from Ocean Alliance successfully collect a sample of snot from a blue whale. The research team is developing drone technology to obtain biological samples from whales in a non-invasive manner. This expedition was to the Sea of Cortez, one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. More than 6,000 species of animals can be found there, 39 percent of the world’s total number of species of marine mammals and a third of the world’s marine cetacean species. The first episode, called ""Gasp,"" goes in depth on how massive dust storms from Africa fertilize the Amazon, and how that fertilization helps trees produce oxygen and pull water up into the atmosphere. Subsequent episodes—""Storm"" and ""Shield""—address how the Earth was made and how Earth's magnetic field protects life, respectively. The topics are interesting themselves, but I can not stress enough how perhaps the biggest strength of this series is its visual style. Darren Aronofsky and his longtime collaborator Ari Handel were executive producers on this project, and the visual style that you see in movies they've worked on together (like The Fountain, Black Swan, and The Wrestler ) is just as present in One Strange Rock. Combined with National Geographic’s reputation for high-quality photojournalism, the first three episodes of One Strange Rock are stunning and worth your time even on mute (although don't do that: again, you want to hear the astronauts speak). Each episode takes you around the world, viewing parts of the Earth through biology, chemistry, astronomy, and human culture. The series does a great job of interviewing local researchers in the field, not just relying on staged interviews from a musty office at UC Berkeley. One Strange Rock also keeps its episodes moving: you never quite feel like you're ""done"" with a topic, because every new scene unfolds with a new perspective. Among my critiques, I would say that the main narrator, Will Smith (notable defender of Earth from Independence Day ), had a jokey delivery that sometimes grated. By episode three, I felt like he started hitting the tone of the show a bit better, so perhaps the later episodes are more fluid. But in episodes one and two, his quips and jokes were jarring compared to the rest of the show, which tends to come off more deliberate and even a bit more serious (though it's by no means overly dense). Most likely, Smith's delivery does well with kids, and this is a family-friendly show, so maybe my mildly annoyed reaction wouldn't be shared by parents who want to watch something from Aronofsky without scarring their child for life (I saw Requiem for a Dream as an adult and it still scarred me for life). Enlarge / Earth view from the International Space Station with aurora visible. Whether you have kids or not, this show will probably teach you something about how the Earth works, or at least it will show you beautiful images of what you already know. I asked Root about how Nutopia fact-checks these kinds of TV documentaries, and she said that they have a ""huge number"" of people who fact-check each show. ""We write very detailed annotations... we try to always go to several sources not just one source,"" Root explained. One thing you may notice in the first three episodes if you're a reader of Ars is that, for as much as One Strange Rock focuses on the science of Earth systems, there's not a lot of focus on climate change. In episode three it's mentioned, but the topic doesn't get a lot of playtime, at least in the first three episodes Ars has viewed. Root says that for the purposes of this show, that's deliberate. Root said that approach stems from when she worked with David Attenborough on Planet Earth, where they took the position that before you can address the problems we've created on Earth, ""you have to fall in love with it."" ""What you want to do is have something that has… joy, and levity and excitement,"" Root added. ""We wanted it [One Strange Rock ] to be about the astoundingness and beauty of the Earth."" Nitpicks aside, if falling in love with Earth again is what the producers of One Strange Rock wanted from me, mission accomplished. To those of you who have been stunned in the past by a series like Planet Earth yet finished that wanting even more focused environmental info, set your DVR. One Strange Rock debuts tonight on the National Geographic Channel with episodes two and three scheduled to air on the following Mondays.

"Rebecca Onion, Rebecca Onion","Here’s a doozy of a birth story: In an 1830 issue of the Western Journal of Medical and Physical Sciences, Dr. John L. Richmond describes an impromptu surgery he performed in rural Ohio. Richmond had made his way through a storm to a “bleak home, with its dirt floor and gaping crevices in the logs that constituted walls.” He found a woman who had been in labor for hours, but each contraction was followed by “general convulsions” and “alarming faintings.” He dosed her with laudanum and sulphuric ether, which helped with the “fits,” but he could not figure out why her labor wasn’t progressing. Richmond told the woman, the midwives who had been attending her prior to his arrival, and the friends and family watching and worrying that only a cesarean section would give the patient and the baby any chance to survive. “Feeling a deep and solemn sense of my responsibility, with only a case of common pocket instruments,” Richmond made the incision. “The woman’s friends,” Jacqueline Wolf writes in her absorbing new book, Cesarean Section: An American History of Risk, Technology, and Consequence, “helped by holding blankets in front of candles to prevent the howling wind from leaving the surgical scene in total darkness.” Richmond couldn’t pull the baby out through his incision and ended up fishing around in the woman’s uterus, looking for the feet. “The mother begged him to stop,” Wolf writes. “She couldn’t endure the pain.” The doctor referred to the medical ethics of that time and place, and made a horrifying decision. “Reminding himself that ‘a childless mother is better [off] than a motherless child,’ ” Wolf writes, “Richmond altered course and proceeded to remove the fetus, in pieces, from the wound in the mother’s abdomen.” The mother survived and went back to work 24 days after the surgery. “After she healed, Richmond examined her thoroughly and discovered an abnormally shallow vagina with no discernable cervical opening,” Wolf reports. Richmond’s story is the first published account of a C-section performed in the United States. It was a last resort, only after drastic interventions that could include the use of forceps or the execution of a craniotomy, in which the doctor would collapse a baby’s skull in order to extract it from the woman and save her life. C-sections remained extremely rare throughout the 19 th century. Even after the mid-20 th -century advent of antibiotics and blood transfusions, which rendered the surgery much safer, the national rate of C-sections remained low. Then, the procedure exploded. Between 1965 and 1987, it rose 455 percent. Today, despite the work of the birth-reform movement of the ’70s and ’80s, 1 in 3 babies are still delivered by C-section. That’s twice the recommendation set by the World Health Organization, which states that a 10–15 percent rate is the ideal, since a rate higher than that has been assessed to have no effect on mortality rates, even as it pushes up medical costs and increases other risks for both mother and baby. Wolf’s book explains how we got here, taking a long, historically informed view of a modern problem. It’s an activist text, committed to the proposition that our C-section rate is dangerously high, but it’s also plainly excellent in its account of how medical and cultural factors combined to get us to this point. Nineteenth-century medical texts “counseled physicians to refrain from interfering with the birth process.” Births were mostly attended by midwives. When a doctor had to come in, like Richmond, they worked under the assumption that it was more important to save the woman’s life than the baby’s. As a pregnant woman is prone to hemorrhage, the surgery was perceived as far too dangerous to undertake lightly. It was a last resort, only after drastic interventions that could include the use of forceps or the execution of a craniotomy, in which the doctor would collapse a baby’s skull in order to extract it from the woman and save her life. The section of Wolf’s book that covers craniotomy is very difficult to read, but as an illustration of how medical priorities around women and babies have changed over the past two centuries, its vividness is unrivaled. Given that many doctors shied from C-sections because of the value they placed on the mother’s life, it makes a terrible kind of sense that many 19 th -century cesarean patients were enslaved women, whose owners, performing their own calculations as to the relative value of woman and baby, gave consent to the surgery. Wolf cites an 1863 case in Arkansas in which the slave owner asked the doctor to remove the patient’s ovaries after a second cesarean, to prevent her from getting pregnant again: “The child survived the birth; the mother died 10 days later of peritonitis.” Another slaveholder celebrated a successful cesarean by setting the baby, named “Cesarinne,” free. Wolf’s chapter on the 19 th -century record draws from the data left behind by Robert P. Harris, a Philadelphia physician who became a medical statistician. Harris took an interest in the C-section surgery and solicited accounts from doctors who had performed them. “His accounts appear to be inviolable,” Wolf writes. “After receiving the initial description of a surgery, he followed up by contacting witnesses and the patient, if she had survived, for corroboration.” A majority of the cases Harris documented were black patients; 20 percent of surgeries occurred in cases where the women were (in his description) “dwarfs.” Though curious about the surgery’s possibilities, Harris was no cesarean booster. He found a 52 percent death rate in his records. He also collected stories of situations in which women had been “gored by cattle and forced to deliver their babies through the gaping wound,” as Wolf memorably explains. He found nine, and noted that of those situations, the rate of survival of the women and children involved actually exceeded that of the C-sections performed in New York state before the late 1880s. “There is a far better showing for the cow-horn than the knife,” he observed. Doctors became increasingly concerned about infants in the early 20 th century, when progressive activists took on the cause of reducing infant mortality rates and pressed the federal government to take an interest in children’s health. Two (male) obstetricians helmed opposing sides in the debate over several years, as the surgery’s rate rose slightly but not dramatically. J. Whitridge Williams, head of the department of obstetrics at Johns Hopkins and head of the “non-operators,” made his case against the procedure in 1926, arguing, “Any one with two hands and a few instruments can do a cesarean section … It frequently requires great intelligence not to do it.” (Williams generally advocated that doctors should do as little as possible while attending a birth.) Joseph DeLee, an influential Chicago obstetrician and a prominent “operator,” argued for more intervention in birth, famously writing in a 1920 article, “So frequent are these bad effects [of labor] that I often wonder whether nature did not deliberately intend women to be used up in the process of reproduction, in a manner analogous to that of salmon, which dies after spawning.” In his actual practice, Wolf points out, DeLee was more likely to let poor women labor naturally and to apply “complex, prophylactic techniques to service the wealthy.” Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a 40-year-old first-time mother, traveled to Chicago to consult with him and asked him for an elective cesarean. DeLee told Williams in a letter that he was thinking of doing it, because he had begun to practice a new European-style incision for the operation—the low transverse incision that’s still standard in 2018 and that makes uterine rupture less likely in subsequent births. Eventually, Longworth had a vaginal birth, though not without medical intervention; DeLee administered ether, performed an episiotomy, used forceps, and removed her placenta manually. You can’t find a clean assignment of blame for the high C-section rate in Wolf’s argument, but the advent of electronic fetal monitoring is a watershed in this narrative. In the midcentury period, public opinion on the surgery shifted, albeit slowly. There was a 25-year gap between the simultaneous advent of widely available antibiotics and safe blood transfusions, and the ’70s-era increase in the C-section rate. Wolf uses the two births of John F. Kennedy Jr. and his brother Patrick, in 1960 and 1963, to show how mixed public opinion was on the surgery during this transitional time. Jackie Kennedy already had a fraught reproductive history: a miscarriage in 1955, a C-section to deliver a stillborn daughter (Arabella) in 1956, and a daughter, Caroline, born by C-section in 1957. After John-John was born by C-section in 1960, Americans celebrated, “ignorant of the risks for an infant born more than four weeks prematurely.” John-John survived. But when Patrick, also born via cesarean, died in 1963 after just 39 hours of life, newspaper coverage associated the death with his C-section, not his prematurity. ( Hyaline membrane disease, the cause of his death, was not yet well understood.) To some people, Wolf writes, “the cesarean was a heroic effort that preserved life and health”—for others, “a cesarean was a macabre surgery associated more with death than life.” For Wolf, the story of John-John and Patrick shows how cultural factors may have upped the rate of C-sections in the ’60s and especially the ’70s. In the ’50s and ’60s, diagnostic tools to help physicians assess the health of fetuses and neonates, including the Friedman curve, the Bishop score, and the Apgar score, “heightened obstetricians’ perception of the risks of childbirth,” Wolf writes. In her eyes, these tools were widely misused. Emanuel Friedman acknowledged that his curve, which he first described in a 1954 article as a means of assessing whether the length and pace of a woman’s labor were “normal,” was not the final word on the subject, since many of the labors he observed were of women who had been sedated, treated with synthetic oxytocin (Pitocin), or anesthetized. But even though Friedman himself realized that labors varied, by the early 1960s, Wolf writes, “American physicians had adopted the Friedman curve for use at every birth.” Edward Bishop’s 1964 Bishop score, assessing five cervical and pelvic characteristics in late pregnancy, was meant to help physicians decide when to induce labor with Pitocin, which was first made available in the 1950s. Later, obstetricians Wolf interviewed believed that the score had normalized induction, and “with the increasing number of induced labors, cesarean surgery not only became more likely, it became more acceptable.” The Apgar score (1952), developed by Virginia Apgar, an anesthesiologist who was concerned about the effects of analgesics and anesthetics on neonates and intended to measure a newborn’s physical condition, prompted “a focus on perfection” that, Wolf argues, “contributed to medical and public complacency toward the burgeoning cesarean rate.” You can’t find a clean assignment of blame for the high C-section rate in Wolf’s argument, but the advent of electronic fetal monitoring, or EFM, is a watershed in this narrative. “The rush to perform a cesarean based on doctors’ interpretations of monitor strips profoundly altered the birth experience,” Wolf writes. She interviews Carol (a pseudonym), who, at 20 years old in 1976, came to the hospital in spontaneous labor. There, medical personnel reviewed a fetal monitor strip and found its offering dire. “They said I had to make a decision because they said either that I would die, or my baby would die, or both of us would die, if I didn’t have a cesarean … They said her heart was in distress,” Carol tells Wolf. She consented to the C-section, despite having serious misgivings. The baby survived, but when interviewed 28 years later, Carol was not convinced the surgery had been necessary. Even after the first randomized, controlled trial of EFM, published in 1976, showed that outcomes for labor in high-risk women monitored by an EFM and similar women screened with a fetal stethoscope differed only in that the first group experienced a higher rate of C-sections, doctors continued to use them; indeed, Wolf writes, “most doctors had become uneasy attending a birth without the information the device provided.” And in the 1980s, lawyers began to use evidence from EFM readings in seeking malpractice settlements for birth injury, which further encouraged doctors to go for the “just in case” C-section. The birth-reform movement of the ’70s and ’80s was an offshoot of second-wave feminism that fought for women to be allowed power over their own birth experiences—to have the right to give birth at home, to refuse interventions like induction, anesthesia, and episiotomy at hospitals, and to have access to nurse midwives and amenities like birthing tubs. (This set of commitments will sound familiar to anyone who’s read Ina May Gaskin’s Spiritual Midwifery, a document of the natural-birth movement first published in 1975.) In an accident of history, Wolf argues, the jump in the C-section rate happened at just the wrong time for the surgery to be one of the targets of these reformers. “The most precipitous increase in the surgery, between 1970 and 1985, paralleled a portion of the peak militancy, and greatest successes, of birth reformers,” Wolf writes. But the movement didn’t focus on C-sections initially, and its core momentum dissipated just as the C-section rate became an object of public concern. By the mid-1980s, Wolf explains, “the changes wrought by the birth reform movement proved to be more cosmetic than systemic.” This would be why we are now allowed to have loved ones in the room with us while giving birth, but the C-section rate remains too high. If I have any fault to find with Wolf’s excellent book, it’s this: I think some women may feel no trepidation or qualms at all about the surgery. So, here we are, living with our 1 in 3 rate. C-sections are so common as to be unremarkable now. Of course, they are often necessary, but even in our modern age, they still have consequences. Some women recover easily from the surgery; others find the first weeks of their new baby’s life to be difficult and painful. Mothers who have C-sections may react poorly to the necessary anesthesia, are more prone to develop postpartum blood clots and infections, and may experience placenta accreta in future pregnancies. As for the baby, studies have found that children born by C-section have higher rates of obesity, asthma, and diabetes—though what’s causing these correlations is not yet understood. Birth is, of course, a deeply personal experience, the sort that you don’t quite understand until it happens to you. And indeed, you might not even know that this country has a high rate of C-sections until you have one. When I had an unplanned C-section in 2017, I had no misgivings about it whatsoever. (I had also been in labor for a day and a half, which influenced my perspective.) If I have any fault to find with Wolf’s excellent book, it’s this: I think some women may feel no trepidation or qualms at all about the surgery. Some may find the prospect of a scheduled C-section downright preferable, even considering the risks—like writer Meaghan O’Connell, who recently wrote about the relief of scheduling a second C-section after a very stressful first birth experience, for the Cut. And then, for some women who are in labor already, an unplanned C-section might look like a clean, medical way to guarantee an outcome that seems likely to be good. Many women fill out birth plans detailing all of the choices they want to make in labor, then are faced with deciding whether to stick to them as their doctors’ advice changes, often while they’re having an experience that tests limits of their endurance. For some of those women, the C-section offers the right solution, and they don’t regret it. Not every C-section of borderline necessity turns out to be bad for the woman who has it—and we should take those experiences into consideration here as well. But given the increasing awareness that we may be overusing the surgery, the question is—what’s the average woman who’s trying to avoid an unnecessary C do? How can pregnant people approach the prospect in 2018? Chavi Eve Karkowsky, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist based in New York City (and sometime writer for Slate ), told me that patients should evaluate whatever data they can find about their hospitals’ C-section rates. “A lot of people don’t realize, they’ll pick their doctor, but you’re committing to a hospital,” she said. “And the hospital has all sorts of baggage and protocols and culture you really might not know about. We’re coming to understand that institutional culture and institutional numbers do vary.” (Wolf would agree; the “call to action” at the end of her book recommends that hospitals should be required to make their C-section rates public as well as information about the kinds of diagnoses that have led to surgeries in the past.) Make your priorities for vaginal birth known to your provider, Karkowsky said, and look for some clue as to whether the doctor you’ve chosen has an evidence-based practice. How to ask this question, without being rude or confrontational? “The discussion of any decisions should come with at least some mention of scientific literature, studies, experiments, what we know, and what we don’t know,” she said. “It should always be modified to fit the individual experience, but a doctor who is evidence-based will bring you that evidence.” Evidence, data, word-of-mouth. Of course, pregnant people have enough research to do without adding another book to the pile, so instead of pushing Wolf’s history on them, I’ll recommend that everyone read it. The more we know about how we got here, the better.","Here’s a doozy of a birth story: In an 1830 issue of the Western Journal of Medical and Physical Sciences, Dr. John L.

Rifat Fareed,"Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir - At least one soldier has been killed and several people have been wounded in a fierce gun battle as fighters stormed an army base in Jammu city of Indian-administered Kashmir, according to local officials. The attack on Sunjuwan army camp took place in the early hours of Saturday and was still ongoing many hours later, SD Singh Jamwal, local police chief, told Al Jazeera. Officials said an unknown number of attackers is cornered inside the residential complex of the camp, where they are locked in a fierce standoff. Hundreds of police, army and paramilitary soldiers were called in to dislodge the fighters, who have barricaded themselves inside multi-storey buildings. The vast army installation located in the city of Jammu is located closed to several shopping centres and schools. Speaking to Al Jazeera, an official from the civil administration said the nearby schools had been closed as a precautionary measure and security was beefed up across the area. ""The situation continues to be tense. The attack has taken place in the main city. The exchange of fire is still on,"" the official said. Earlier, the army said in a statement that one junior commissioner officer had been killed in the gun battle during ""operations to evacuate families"". ""Six persons including three women and children have suffered injuries,"" the army said, adding, that due to the presence of women and children in the housing colony, ""the operations are being progressed cautiously to minimise the causalities"". Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh said he was closely monitoring the situation. The attackers are suspected to be affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Pakistan-based group which has launched similar raids in recent years against the army and paramilitary installations across the region. Jammu is the main city in the southern part of the disputed state, claimed by both India and Pakistan in full. The archrivals control parts of the Muslim-majority Himalayan region. Cross-border firing in violation of a 2003 ceasefire agreement has gone up in the past months leading to causalities, with more than a dozen people killed on the Indian side since the beginning of this year. The two nuclear-armed neighbours have been at loggerheads since an attack on an army camp in Kashmir's Uri left 18 Indian soldiers dead in 2016. New Delhi regularly accuses Islamabad of aiding fighters in crossing the de factor border (Line of Control) to attack targets inside India. Pakistan denies the allegations and stresses that it only lends moral and diplomatic support to Kashmiris.","Fighters have attacked an Indian army camp in Jammu, killing at least one soldier as fighting continues.",2018-02-10T15:01:50Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Gun battle as fighters storm Kashmir army camp,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/gun-battle-fighters-storm-kashmir-army-camp-180210122847478.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/2/10/42238a890f044354b34b06ff7f9f45d9_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,storm complex,1
"Dean Visser, Mark Fischetti","Several times a year an atmospheric river—a long, narrow conveyor belt of storms that stream in relentlessly from the Pacific Ocean—drops inches of rain or feet of snow on the U.S. west coast. Such a system triggered floods and mudslides in central and southern California this past weekend. Yet only in the past few years have weather forecasters been able to predict roughly how strong the imminent storms may be.
Now they have a new rating system to help them—and the public—understand what an incoming atmospheric river might unleash; on Tuesday researchers unveiled the “atmospheric river scale.” It ranks severity and impacts, from category 1 (weak) to category 5 (exceptional). “Without a scale, we really had no way to objectively communicate what would be a strong storm or a weak one,” says Martin Ralph, director of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who led the work.
Atmospheric rivers flow through the sky about a mile above the ocean surface, and may extend across a thousand miles of ocean to the coast. Some bring routine rain but the more intense systems can carry as much water as 15 Mississippi Rivers. The series of storms striking land can arrive for days or, occasionally, weeks on end. They hit west-facing coastlines worldwide, although the U.S. experiences more than most other national coasts.
Satellites can see atmospheric rivers growing over an ocean, but the resulting data is not detailed enough for an accurate forecast. Since 2012 scientist and engineers have been gradually building a system of ground-based sensors, including radars that look skyward as the first storm comes ashore, to add moisture and wind data to weather models. Combining all that information can improve forecasts of how much precipitation may fall, and for how long. Still, weather forecasters and emergency planners did not have a solid way to assess how serious potential flooding might be—or, at times, if the rain or snow would actually be advantageous. “Scientists, the media and the public viewed atmospheric rivers as primarily a hazard,” Ralph says, “but the weaker ARs are quite beneficial.” If farm soils are dry or if snowpack or water reservoirs are low, an atmospheric river can revive withering crops and fortify municipal water supplies. “Water managers made it clear to us that a rating scale would be helpful,” he adds. For example, if reservoirs are high and heavy rain is coming, managers might release water from behind dams so they are not stressed or overtopped later.
The scale, published Tuesday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, ranks atmospheric rivers on five levels:
Category 1: Weak—primarily beneficial
Category 2: Moderate—mostly beneficial, but also somewhat hazardous
Category 3: Strong—balance of beneficial and hazardous
Category 4: Extreme—mostly hazardous, but also beneficial (if persistent drought
Category 5—Exceptional—primarily hazardous

Working together, Ralph’s center at Scripps, the National Weather Service and other agencies will determine into which category a storm fits. Having such a straightforward scale to assess a complex weather pattern like an atmospheric river is valuable, according to James Doyle, a senior scientist at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory who was not involved with the work. “Lots of terms in meteorology are hard for the public to understand—or easy for them to misunderstand,” he says, such as atmospheric river or polar vortex. “The scale gives a clear picture of the types of conditions that may be coming.”
The scale does not have a formal name such as the Enhanced Fujita scale for tornadoes or the Saffir–Simpson scale for hurricanes. And it differs in a key way: Those scales focus on hazards but not potential benefits—although it is unclear if a hurricane or tornado could have any constructive effect. Also, unlike the others the new scale considers storm duration a fundamental factor. After Hurricane Harvey stalled over Houston and Hurricane Florence got stuck over the Carolinas—both creating much more flooding and damage than anticipated—the Saffir–Simpson scale was criticized for not adequately conveying the risk of hurricanes that are very slow moving upon landfall.
Researchers are considering whether they could possibly predict if an upcoming year will have many atmospheric rivers, which Ralph says can make the difference between states such as California having a year of drought or flood. A seasonal or annual forecast could help farmers decide what kind of crops to plant and help municipal planners decide whether to curtail water use to safeguard reservoir levels.
Seasonal predictions would be invaluable, but “that’s a major challenge,” Doyle says. Scientists would have to better understand how atmospheric rivers fit within the larger weather systems around them. And models would have to improve how they integrate major processes involved, such as the always-changing state of clouds as well as heat and moisture exchange between air and ocean, he notes. “But,” he adds, “it’s a great goal.”
In the shorter term Ralph hopes local meteorologists might include an atmospheric river symbol in their television and online graphics. Several years ago he was having breakfast at a restaurant in San Francisco when he saw a TV weather forecast displaying little sun and cloud icons across the bottom of the screen. They indicated rain would develop. “I knew that a strong atmospheric river was coming,” he says. But “that little shower icon did nothing to convey what was about to happen. Maybe there could be an atmospheric river symbol showing the category—how good or bad an approaching storm might be.”","Strings of ocean storms called atmospheric rivers flood California and other western coastlines, although sometimes they can be beneficial -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com",2019-02-05T17:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Warning Scale Unveiled for Dangerous Rivers in the Sky,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/warning-scale-unveiled-for-dangerous-rivers-in-the-sky/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/C76966C7-5C9B-49D9-A2E8E8883548BA77.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,storm complex,1
DANIEL MANZO,"A strong cold front brought snow squalls, gusty winds and some hail to parts of the Midwest on Saturday. Wind gusts close to 60 mph were reported from Iowa to Michigan, including parts of Chicago and Indianapolis. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Several waterspouts were also reported on Lake Erie and a confirmed EF-0 tornado with winds up to 75 mph hit West Seneca, New York. The tornado did damage to a condo complex in the town. Behind the front, it is quite cold by October standards. Wind chills are in the 20s across the Midwest on Sunday morning, and wind chills in the 30s extend all the way into the southern U.S. from Arkansas to Georgia. The wind chill is only in the 20s and 30s across most of the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday morning. In the Northeast, wind chills in the 30s are expected from Washington, D.C., to Boston. Also, winds are still gusty in the wake of the front across the Carolinas and into portions of the mid-Atlantic. Wind gusts over 30 mph are possible through the morning hours Sunday. Colder air moving over the Great Lakes is causing some isolated snow squalls to move into parts of the Northeast. While little to no accumulation is likely, these snow squalls could briefly cause low visibility and gusty winds. Wind chills will be even colder on Monday morning in the Northeast. The core of this cold blast will settle into the Northeast for Monday morning, with wind chills in the 20s and low 30s in some areas. The Midwest will recover somewhat Monday morning, but another cold blast is quickly sneaking in. There will be another wave of cold air that will move into the Midwest on Tuesday and Wednesday, and eventually reach the Northeast by Thursday morning. Temperatures will dip back into the 30s on Thursday in the Northeast after a brief respite on Tuesday and Wednesday. More rain coming to Texas Drier weather on Saturday allowed Lake Travis, near Austin, Texas, to begin decreasing in water level. This is the first time the water level is decreasing since near-record flooding earlier this week in the region. Most of Texas will be dry Sunday, with heavy rain confined to the extreme southern Texas coastline near Brownsville. Some rain will move back into parts of south-central Texas on Monday, but a more widespread shot of rain appears to be in the forecast again for later in the week. Part of the threat for rain comes from Hurricane Willa in the eastern Pacific. Tropical moisture will move into Mexico and later the U.S. Southwest from Willa during the middle of the week. Willa formed into a hurricane in the eastern Pacific early Sunday. Satellite imagery shows a rapidly organizing and strengthening tropical system approximately 240 miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Hurricane Willa has maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and the storm is moving northwest at 7 mph. It is relatively small, with hurricane-force winds extending only 10 miles from the center. Hurricane Willa is rapidly intensifying and will become a major hurricane by Monday morning and likely a Category 4 hurricane within the next 48 hours. Willa will come very close to the Mexican coastline as a major Category 4 hurricane. Some wind shear will interact with the storm as it approaches the coast, which could cause the storm to weaken in intensity right before -- or at -- landfall late Tuesday or early Wednesday. At this point it is unclear the magnitude of the impact in Mexico, however, strong winds and very heavy rain remain likely. Willa will rapidly weaken over the mountains of Mexico. However, some tropical moisture from Willa will move into much of northern Mexico and begin to interact with a different system in the Southwest. Rainfall will be heaviest in south-central Texas over the next few days. As a result of this interaction, some tropical moisture could spread into parts of Texas by Wednesday, with locally heavy rain and flash flooding possible. Rainfall totals could exceed 4 inches in spots. However, at this time it is too early to determine the specific location of the heaviest rain.",It is winter jacket weather across the Northeast and Midwest.,2018-10-21T13:00:43Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Powerful cold front brings snow squalls, gusty winds to Midwest and Northeast",https://abcnews.go.com/US/powerful-cold-front-brings-snow-squalls-gusty-winds/story?id=58644645,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/wisc-snow-ugc-mo-20181021_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,storm complex,1
Dave Irwin,"Fortnite is now in its eighth season! Yes, it took them this long to push the “insert Pirates” button. The map has seen a substantial changes, including a volcano that’s erupted from out of nowhere. With each week comes some brand new challenges, some more fiendishly complex than others, so this guide hub aims to have all the details for both free and Battle Pass challenges for season 8.
With the game being the global sensation that it is, there’s a lot to learn about not only getting that all-important “Victory Royale”, but also the changes to the map as the seasons progress, and the challenges you can seek to complete. Head over to our main Fortnite guide hub for every single thing you need to get started.
Fortnite Season 8
Season 8 began on 28th February 2019 and introduces a Pirate theme. In a huge shakeup to the northern part of the map, it seems that Wailing Woods, Tomato Temple, and Lazy Links have been jettisoned out of existence thanks to the rise of a volcano and flooding of the golf course. The Block has also moved to the north-western side of the island. In place of all of these regions are two new named areas: Lazy Lagoon is directly replacing Lazy Links, and Sunny Steps which is north-east of the massive volcano over the top of Wailing Woods. For more on the changes themselves and how they affect the map itself, you can head to Ollie’s Fortnite locations guide.
You can also now get the help of your friends to complete challenges, both daily and weekly. All you need to do is go into the challenge page, click onto the challenge you’d like assistance with, and click the “Party Assist” button. This is particularly useful if you’re struggling with some of the combat challenges and you’re playing alongside more experienced players.

Tips for Fortnite challenges
A lot of the challenges in Fortnite revolve around getting kills and damage with certain weapons, possibly in certain locations, or just merely landing in locations on the map. Here are a couple of tips aimed to help you in completing those challenges.
Season 8 introduces “Party Assist”. Before a match, select a daily or weekly challenge for you to be able to complete it.
For the various weapon challenges, your best bet is to compete in a Limited Time Mode (LTM) that features respawns. Since all damage is cumulative during a match, even those that say “in a Single Match”, you should be able to at least have a good attempt to complete that challenge.
In challenges that require eliminations in specific locations, some areas are better than others. Tilted Towers and Pleasant Park are very popular locations to drop into, so if you’re looking for a less popular area to descend into, try for the second area.
Make sure that you have completed matches rather than quitting as soon as you finish you have done your task. Some challenges require the match to be finished before it will count.
What you get with the Season 8 Battle Pass
You should probably know a bit more about the Battle Pass itself. Fortnite’s Battle Royale mode is free to play, with a fair number of challenges being free to complete, giving you a taste of what the Battle Pass challenges have to offer. If you were lucky to complete enough of the challenges in the Overtime challenge set, you got this season for free, but the Battle Pass for each season is usually priced at 950 V-Bucks. This now means forking out £7.99, 9.99, and $9.99 respectively to purchase 1000 V-Bucks, leaving you with 50 V-Bucks left over, but they usually come with a few unlocks to begin with.
You’ll also unlock more stuff as you play matches, either through levels or completing each of the individual challenges. Challenges are unlocked as the season progresses, though once the season is over, the challenges are gone forever, so you’ll need to get in quick. You can also throw some more money (150 V-Bucks per Tier level) to unlock the next rank, but it’s not advisable to do so unless there is a particular skin coming up that you really, really, really want. The exception to this are the style challenges which stay unlocked and able to be completed after the season finishes.
However, some of you are probably wanting to know how to spend the least amount of money on Fortnite. If you’d like one tip, try not to spend V-Bucks if you want to maximise your investment. It’s entirely possible to save up V-Bucks as you progress through the ranks until you can afford the next season.
What were the previous Challenges?
Please note that these challenge guides are for challenges no longer available to complete in the game.
Season 7 challenges
Season 7 began late last year on 6th December 2018. The theme is a holiday themed one, and saw a few big changes. Flush Factory and Greasy Grove are now gone, along with the addition of ziplines, new icy terrain, and a new vehicle that dominated the meta in the form of the X-4 Stormwing. It also introduced some free challenges in the form of the 14 Days Of Fortnite challenges and the current Ice Storm event, as well as some new cosmetic items such as wraps for weapons.

"Rosa Inocencio Smith, Shan Wang","What We’re Following Manafort Flips: Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, has agreed to cooperate “fully, truthfully, and completely” with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Franklin Foer outlines the several big mysteries of the Russia investigation that Manafort’s cooperation could help untangle. Earth, Wind, and Fire: Hurricane Florence made landfall in North Carolina on Friday as a Category 1 storm, but it is estimated to bring with it 18 trillion gallons of rain over the next few days. North of the storm, explosions erupted in dozens of homes across three towns in Massachusetts late Thursday night, with as many as 70 fires, explosions, and suspected gas leaks reported to state police—a scale “unprecedented in recent years.” The Emmys: New shows like Atlanta, Killing Eve, Barry, and Succession defy classification. Looking ahead to the 2018 Emmy Awards on Monday, Sophie Gilbert writes that the Emmys are still trying to shove these complex shows into the square boxes of “comedy” or “drama.” Earlier this week, the singer John Legend got his EGOT—an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony—after winning a Creative Arts Emmy, making him the second black person ever to reach EGOT status. But don’t take Legend’s achievement as definitive evidence of racial progress in the American entertainment industry, John Vilanova warns. — Shan Wang Snapshot Matthew Baker photographed these sunbathers on a beach in Vis, Croatia, on September 2, 2016.

Evening Read Bianca Bosker on how the dinosaurs died: According to this well-established fire-and-brimstone scenario, the dinosaurs were exterminated when a six-mile-wide asteroid, larger than Mount Everest is tall, slammed into our planet with the force of 10 billion atomic bombs. The impact unleashed giant fireballs, crushing tsunamis, continent-shaking earthquakes, and suffocating darkness that transformed the Earth into what one poetic scientist described as “an Old Testament version of hell” … But [the paleontologist Gerta] Keller doesn’t buy any of it. “It’s like a fairy tale: ‘Big rock from sky hits the dinosaurs, and boom they go.’ And it has all the aspects of a really nice story,” she said. “It’s just not true.” Keep reading, as Bosker describes how Keller has reopened the debate over the dinosaurs’ extinction—and become the center of the nastiest feud in science.

Chris Snyder,"Stories are not always sunshine and rainbows. Oftentimes you need to recreate heavy snowstorms, rain showers and other extreme weather to make a production feel more realistic. That's where people like Jeremy Chernick of J&amp;M Special Effects come in. We spoke with Jeremy to find out how various weather is recreated on Broadway, live shows, and film to look like the real thing. Following is a transcript of the video. Narrator: Whether you need a snow storm, a huge gust of wind, or a fake rain shower, this man's got you covered. Some TV shows and movies film scenes in extreme weather to make the story feel more realistic. But there's one big problem with that approach. Jeremy Chernick: You can never count on the weather to work for you. Narrator: Jeremy Chernick is a designer at J&amp;M Special Effects in Brooklyn. Chernick: You can't schedule the entire crew around waiting for snow. Narrator: So you often have to make it yourself. Jeremy's company creates practical special effects for a variety of live shows, music videos, and other productions. Chernick: All the Disney Broadway shows, ""Aladdin,"" ""Frozen."" Narrator: He made it rain on Shawn Mendes at the 2018 MTV VMAs. J&amp;M also rents out equipment for TV shows like ""Gotham,"" and ""Elementary."" Basically, any conditions you can imagine, he can whip up. But the trick to creating fake weather is that it just needs to look real in the camera frame. Chernick: You don't need all the weather in the world to know it's raining in a shot this big. You just need rain in the background or rain on top. Narrator : So what exactly does it take to create the illusion of weather on camera or on stage? Chernick: There are a lot of different ways that rain is done. And it depends on whether you're interior or exterior. Narrator: Outside, you can get a permit to hook up a hose to a fire hydrant or a water truck. Chernick: You can split that water out to a variety of locations, and usually high big towers go up that can spray water from unbelievably high. Narrator: Indoors you need a self-contained system attached to water supply. Chernick: Right above me is a rain bar. So we have rain that is pouring down in sort of a five-inch channel, so if you're looking dead at it, it looks pretty three-dimensional because you have rain here and here, and plus we can add a level of sort of mist into that that will just give it an even larger depth of field. And you can rows and rows and rows of them. The systems in place to keep that rain from never ever dripping unless you wanted it to rain is actually more complex than the moments when it's actually raining. It's mostly fairly low tech. Narrator : There are a number of different products that are used to replicate snowflakes. Chernick: You can get pretty large paper flakes that are squares and they fall in a very beautiful and specific way, you can get shredded paper that falls sort of organically. You can get it shredded plastic, which has a different feel to it, and the way that you deliver that is through blowers that are blowing it far overhead and a long distance. Narrator: They also have special soap-based products that won't stain clothes or make the ground slippery. Chernick: Essentially, it's like tiny bits of foam and that is a machine that is pushing that soap through a filter that makes it into snowflakes. Environmentally, there's all sorts of stuff that ends up in the air to fill a picture in terms of haze, fog, smoke. Narrator: These effects are usually produced with a fog machine. Chernick: The most commonly used interior fog is glycol based, which is a type of alcohol. Narrator : Sometimes you want the fog to fill the screen, and other times you want low-lying fog, which requires a few special tricks. Chernick: That is most often done now using liquid CO2, or liquid nitrogen to chill the glycol fog to a very cold level. And that coldness is what heats it low to the ground. The thing that's funny about wind, to me, is that you don't see wind unless it's either moving clothing or hair, or if it has some fog or some level of fog in it. Narrator: J&amp;M has fans of all sizes. We have incredibly quiet fans designed specifically for live television.

Emily Gera,"An upcoming patch for Blizzard’s MOBA effort “Heroes of the Storm” will remove pay-for loot boxes, the company announced in a blog post.
Loot chests, as they’re called in the game, have been available to purchase through the game’s official shop using gems, the premium currency in “Heroes of the Storm.” Loot chests contain random rewards like alternate skins, banners, emojis, voice lines, sprays, and other exclusive items. With the release of the next patch, these items can only be bought using gold earned in-game.
The patch will also bring changes to hero roles, splitting characters into tanks, bruisers, supports, healers, melee assassins, and ranged assassins. These changes were first detailed by Blizzard on Monday.
“As the roster and breadth of mechanics for ‘Heroes of the Storm’ has continued to expand, the existing roles have grown limited in accurately describing each individual hero. To give both new and existing players a clearer idea of what kind of kit to expect during hero select, we are expanding hero roles to include new descriptions and replace those that were less clear in the past.”
These changes will coincide with a new event called Caldeum Complex, which is cyberpunk-themed and filled with dragons and an anti-capitalist hacker called Chromie. Players will need to help Chromie in preventing a cataclysm and take on the megacorps by completing certain objectives.
The patch is currently live in the “Heroes” Public Test Realm, where it will be available to playtest until Mar. 25.","An upcoming patch for Blizzard’s MOBA effort “Heroes of the Storm” will remove pay-for loot boxes, the company announced in a blog post.

Ashley Fetters,"Alton Davis’s parents didn’t tell him much about the coming hurricane before they took shelter. All he knew was that the storm “might be dangerous,” so the family drove from their little house in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie uptown to Davis’s grandparents’ house near Audubon Park. It was a sturdy old building made of brick and stucco, Davis, now an architect, recalls. He’d been ordered to stay in the middle of the house and away from the windows. It was 1965, and Davis’s parents didn’t know much about the coming storm themselves: No one did. “We didn't have storm trackers or any of that stuff,” he says. “We just knew there was a hurricane coming. I don't think people had any idea what the damage could be.” On September 10, Davis, then 10 years old, rode out Hurricane Betsy while wrapped in a blanket and huddled together with his family in the center hallway of the house. Gallon jugs of drinking water were stationed nearby as they all listened to the wind whistle through the double doors. His little brother cried in his parents’ arms. “They hunkered down and just held us, kept us warm,” he remembers. Then, suddenly, the whistling stopped, and Davis’ father announced they were going outside. “It was beautiful. Blue, sunny skies,” Davis tells me. “There were trees uprooted and branch limbs everywhere. It was a mess. But we stood out on the front porch, and then the next thing you know, he says, ‘We need to go back in now.’” Davis didn’t understand at the time, but the eye of the storm, a brief period of calm weather, was passing over their house. The winds started up again as soon as they got inside and the “back end” of the hurricane resumed. Hurricane Betsy, which hit the Gulf Coast nearly a decade before the current standard for classifying storms was widely adopted, is believed today to have been equivalent to a Category 3 or even Category 4 hurricane when it made landfall in Louisiana. Today, most parents of hurricane-prone areas like Louisiana know better than to let their kids go outside during a major storm, even when the eye of the storm is passing over. Davis, now 63, has lived in the New Orleans area for most of his life, and he’s seen first-hand how families in the area are taking hurricane preparation increasingly seriously. When Hurricane Katrina hammered the city in 2005, Davis was again “hunkered down” with his brother, this time with their own kids under strict orders to stay inside until the storm had completely passed. Even though storm-tracking technology has grown more sophisticated and residents are better informed about the specific risks of each storm, Davis has noticed that his neighbors no longer tailor their preparations to individual hurricanes—rather, they start early and prepare for hurricane season. They prepare for the worst before it even materializes. To many Americans, it certainly feels like devastating hurricanes are happening more often than they used to. Indeed, four of the five costliest hurricanes in recorded U.S. history have made landfall in the last decade. And the fifth, Hurricane Katrina, was still in this century, killing more than 1,800 people and causing more than $125 billion in property damage after it hit in August 2005. One major factor in the rise of overall destruction is increased development along the hurricane-prone coastal regions of the U.S.—which means that more people are at risk of having their homes, schools, workplaces, and churches destroyed in a storm. But, for families, preventing physical damage is only half the battle. “One of the things we're finally recognizing is that disasters are social phenomena. That they have these complex social dynamics, and that we can't just think about it in terms of technological fixes,” explains Alice Fothergill, a sociologist at the University of Vermont and co-author of the book Children of Katrina. Which is largely why the social-science research on hurricanes has exploded in the past decade. Researchers now understand more about the personal toll that these devastating storms inflict on survivors, and especially very young survivors, than they did decades ago. And as a result, the way families prepare for, endure, and recover from hurricanes together looks altogether different even from when Alton Davis was a child in the ’60s. Part of the reason families have gotten better at responding to hurricanes is that federal agencies—including FEMA (which is part of the Department of Homeland Security) and the Department of Health and Human Services—have started to work with states to encourage families to develop safety plans well before a hurricane hits. FEMA, for example, has a printable “hurricane preparedness” checklist on its website that includes an inventory of what households should have on hand before a hurricane (categories include “medical needs,” “critical documents,” “tools and safety items,” and “food/supplies”) and what numbers, names, and meeting places family members should memorize should they get separated during the storm. For families, stocking up on food and water and boarding up windows aren’t the only things to consider. Agencies also recommend that parents take an active role in helping kids cope emotionally before, during, and after hurricanes and other disasters. Ready.gov, a website created by the DHS as a resource for families looking to plan ahead in case of a disaster, has an educational guide for parents about children’s typical reactions to disaster based on their age. Babies who have experienced trauma, it says, will cry more; teenagers may become more withdrawn or more prone to dangerous or risky behaviors. Preschool kids often get separation anxiety and later “reenact the incident or the disaster over and over again.” School-age kids may want to talk about the event continually and become intensely preoccupied with its minor details. How kids make sense of hurricanes Nicole Johnson, a 35-year-old community college instructor who lives in Durham, North Carolina, is one of the many parents figured out how to help her kids through Hurricane Florence. When I spoke to her on Wednesday evening, just a day and a half before the storm made landfall in the state, she was implementing some of the same strategies proffered by the DHS. Two days before, Johnson’s eight-year-old son had come to her, worried, and told her, “Mom, I don’t want to go to school on Thursday, even if they have school.” “I was like, ‘Well, let’s just wait and see,’” Johnson says. “I kept reminding him, ‘I won’t send you to school if I don’t think it’s safe for you to be at school.’ I think that was kind of relieving to him.” By Wednesday night, Johnson had moved from all-hands-on-deck preparation mode to waiting mode—she and her husband had spent the last three days filling their home with groceries, securing away furniture and toys from their yard, and using the delivery service Amazon Prime Now to stock up on supplies. Now, their biggest concern was how to maintain the sanity of three little kids—their son and two four-year-old twin girls—who were about to be confined to their home for what might be days on end. For the younger two of the three Johnson children, the most pressing concern about the coming storm was that their iPads might run out of battery. “We have more fully charged battery packs than people in our house right now,” Johnson says. In prepping their children for the hurricane, Johnson and her husband did, however, leave out a few details as to why her parents were in town for the week. They live on the coast in Wilmington, North Carolina, an area where residents were encouraged—though not required—to evacuate. “We didn't really explain how bad it's supposed to hit at their house,” Johnson says. (Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm on Friday evening, but not before it deluged the Carolinas with rain. Two hurricane-related fatalities were reported in Wilmington.) [ Why Hurricane Florence is so dangerous ] For families dealing with hurricanes, communication can be a game changer. When Fothergill, the sociologist, spent time with kids who had been through Hurricane Katrina, she found that what often upset those who were most affected was not knowing where their loved ones were. “This was true for a lot of kids whose parents don't live together, or who are very close to extended family members—maybe those who evacuate separately,” Fothergill says. “Having communication, knowing where they are and knowing that they're safe, is important.” Fothergill also found kids “felt really stressed and felt tremendous anxiety” when they couldn’t locate their friends. Of course, the desire to keep loved ones close is what often puts families at a disadvantage, too. “What we saw in Katrina was that people wanted to be with their whole families,"" she adds. “So, if someone couldn't evacuate, or wouldn't evacuate, families would say, ‘Well, let's just stick this out together.’ That happens quite a bit with elderly family members.” Kids whose families stayed behind to weather Hurricane Katrina in their homes, she said, were often traumatized by having been directly involved in scary situations. Fothergill also spoke to several parents who had tried to keep their families together through Katrina at all costs, “but still ended up in situations that were really difficult for their kids.” For example, some hospitals in New Orleans allowed employees to keep their children with them as they worked shifts during the storm, but as the basement flooded and the building lost power, it wasn’t the safest place for kids to be. So perhaps the most important precautions parents can take for their children are to reassure them that they’re out of harm’s way and to actually get them out of harm’s way. “In a lot of studies we find that kids who experience the intensity of the event do have a harder time coping,” Fothergill says. “It really is important to evacuate and not be in it. Being with family is important,” she adds, but so is “not feeling like they're in a life-threatening situation.” Families are also increasingly realizing that letting kids, if they’re able, be able part of the preparation of relief efforts can help them feel less powerless over the situation. “Let them be part of preparedness,” says Fothergill. “Let them be part of deciding what gets put in the car. Let them help a friend, or a grandparent. And afterwards, in the immediate aftermath, parents should figure out ways that kids can contribute, because it will help them heal.” That was the case for Cody Ward, who lived in Boca Raton, Florida with his mom and brother when Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne all hit in quick succession. After boarding up the windows in their house while their mother worked at Home Depot outfitting last-minute hurricane preppers with supplies, Ward and his brother proceeded down their street helping their neighbors fortify their homes. It’s probably not a coincidence that Ward, now 32, remembers that time not as a scary or trauma-inducing event, but as a time of community and goodwill. “It was fun,” Ward says of the day that he and his brother helped all their neighbors prepare for the worst. “We were all friends. We all grew up together.” If there’s one silver lining to the increased frequency of deadly hurricanes, it’s that the protocols for family survival are being assessed and improved with a new sense of urgency. “We’re having so many big storms,” says Fothergill, “that we're learning about where we've had weaknesses in our systems.” For example, after Hurricane Katrina, biological parents of kids in foster families who had evacuated the city had little idea how to reach them, as phone service often goes out during hurricanes. To complicate matters, some of the records linking kids to their birth parents in the state system were destroyed in the storm. “But the thing is,” she adds, “we're learning. I know the Department of Children and Families in New Jersey [where Hurricane Sandy hit in 2011] learned a lot from the Louisiana department about that.” There are, however, still some persistent weaknesses. The question of what to do with family pets in the event of a hurricane, for example, still often causes anguish for families. Leaving a pet behind can be life-threatening and traumatic for the animal, of course, but also, “it’s incredibly distressing to some children if the pets become lost or if they die, even if the separation isn’t long,” says Fothergill. There’s a similar dearth of good options for families with members who can’t evacuate or be with their families because of their age. Cody Ward now lives in Deerfield, Florida, where he works as a respiratory therapist in the neonatal intensive care unit of a children’s hospital. Immediately after a storm hits, some hospitals are still closed for visitation. In some cases, Ward says, new parents “may have just given birth two days before, and now they can’t see their kids.” When Hurricane Irma hit last year, Ward knew exactly how to talk to his own son about the hurricane—because his primary concern was why he was stuck inside the house. “He was two and half and had never really experienced anything,” Ward says. He’s already thinking of ways to change his approach as his son gets older. “I'm gonna have to look into it,” he says. And soon, before the next one—the inevitable next one—hits.","For many parents, ensuring that the kids are out of harm’s way is only half the battle.",2018-09-15T12:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Families Are Getting Better at Preparing for Hurricanes,https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/09/family-hurricane-preparation/570385/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/09/GettyImages_1032890856/facebook.jpg?1536964172,,Theatlantic.com,storm complex,1
Evan Minsker,"Laurie Anderson has teamed up with the Kronos Quartet for a new album. Landfall is out February 16 via Nonesuch. The piece, inspired by Anderson’s experience during Hurricane Sandy, has been performed multiple times at festivals. It’s 30 tracks long and features song titles like “CNN Predicts a Monster Storm” and “The Wind Lifted the Boats and Left Them on the Highway.” Listen to “We Learn to Speak Yet Another Language” below. Anderson said in a statement: “These are stories with tempos. I’ve always been fascinated by the complex relationship of words and music whether in song lyrics, supertitles or voice over. In Landfall, instruments initiate language through our new text software, erst. The blend of electronic and acoustic strings is the dominant sound of Landfall. Much of the music in this work is generated from the harmonies and delays of unique software designed for the solo viola and reinterpreted for the quartet. In addition, there were elements of the optigan, a keyboard that uses information stored on optical discs.” Anderson has also announced a new book. All the Things I Lost in the Flood is out February 6 via Rizzoli. The new book is a look through Anderson’s four decades of archives.

Neil Patel,"How do you get a new customer? It may seem like a simple question, but the answer may be more complex than you think. Sure, you’ve got various advertising campaigns, and you’re generating sales. A reasonable assumption would be that your marketing promotions are creating sales. While this may be partially true, it’s not a full answer. One of the keys to running a successful business is to understand the customer buying process. Just because you’re selling something a consumer wants or needs doesn’t mean you are automatically in a position to make a sale. But leveraging the basic concepts of the customer conversion funnel will make it easier for you to guide the consumer through the buying process. This puts you in a position to maximize your conversion rates and ultimately generate more profits for your company. There is a ton of information on the Internet about the customer conversion funnel. The funnel may look a little bit different, depending on whom you ask. While the terminology may vary slightly, here is a basic visualization of what this funnel looks like: These are the steps a buyer goes through before they finalize a purchase. I’ll refer to this image as we continue through this post. Throughout this guide, we’ll look at different versions of the funnel and discuss each stage in greater detail. I’ll also show you some great marketing examples you can incorporate into your own funnel as a way to get more customers and drive sales. If you are not familiar with the customer conversion funnel, this guide will cover all the basic concepts. Here’s what you need to know. Create brand awareness As you can see from the funnel I just showed you, the first stage of the process is the awareness phase. The idea here is for you to come up with marketing strategies that can promote your company to a new audience. As of now, these consumers don’t know your brand exists. You need to change that. Obviously, this is much easier said than done. But there are plenty of ways for you to make this happen. It all depends on the goals of your company. You’ll also have to decide how much money you want to spend when it comes to creating brand awareness. If you’re low on funds, you’ll want to take a look at my top tactics for marketing your company on a budget. One of the most effective ways to create awareness is to improve your SEO strategy. Remember, at this point, the consumers don’t know you exist yet. All they know is they have a want or need for something. Chances are they will start with a search engine. A higher search engine ranking increases the chances of you getting more organic traffic to your website. In fact, 33% of clicks go to the top search result on Google. Furthermore, the first page of an Internet search controls 75% of all clicks. That’s why businesses are investing time and money into optimizing all their marketing channels for SEO in 2018. As you can see from the data, your website isn’t the only way for you to generate new leads and create brand awareness with SEO. Social media is another cost-effective way to promote your business. In fact, 55% of consumers have made purchases directly through social media platforms. That’s why I believe one of the best ways for ecommerce brands to grow is to leverage social commerce. But I’m getting ahead of myself here. Right now, we’re still focusing on brand awareness. I just wanted to explain why these marketing channels are so important. While not all consumers are looking to buy things on social media, it’s still a great place for you to introduce yourself to prospective buyers. Start by creating a profile on as many social media channels as possible. Stay active on these profiles, and post new content daily. Do your best to get more followers. Interact with these followers to increase your engagement rates. As a result, more people will get exposed to your brand. If you want to take this strategy to the next level, you can generate leads with targeted ads. Facebook and Instagram are two of my favorite platforms to use this strategy for. That’s because the ads are set up through the same system, so it’s easy for you to run paid ads through both. While Facebook will always be a top marketing option, it doesn’t mean you should overlook Instagram. Marketers agree that this platform has become a top choice for creating brand awareness. In fact, last year Instagram surpassed Twitter in terms of marketing usage by brands in the United States. As I said earlier, there are tons of ways for you to make consumers aware that your company exists. But some tactics are more effective than others. For example, I’m sure you got flyers in the mail when a new pizza shop opened in your neighborhood. That’s an example of the awareness stage in the conversion funnel. But those types of methods aren’t scalable and applicable to all businesses in today’s day and age. You also want to get quality traffic. Yes, you want as many people as possible to know about your brand. But that’s not helpful if they’ll never actually become customers. It’s important for you to emphasize quality over quantity if you want to create a funnel that yields high conversions. That’s why focusing your efforts on SEO and social media is much more effective. Generate interest Now that people are familiar with your brand, it’s time to take them through the next step of your conversion funnel. You’ve got to come up with ways to create interest in your products and services. Your content strategy is going to be your best friend during this stage of the funnel. You’ll also need to use your website to your advantage. Learn how to design a homepage that converts. Your website needs to provide visitors with as much information as possible about your business so that you can answer any questions they might have. Here’s an example from the SERVPRO website: SERVPRO is a cleanup and restoration company. If someone had a problem at their home, such as mold, they may type phrases like “mold remediation” into a Google search. Due to their SEO efforts, SERVPRO would be a top search result. That’s part of the awareness stage, which I just discussed. But now that a visitor has landed on the homepage, you need them to become interested in this service to get them through the tunnel. Based on this homepage, it’s clear that this company provides a wide range of services that includes restoration from: water damage fire damage mold remediation storm damage commercial services It makes sense that someone who has mold in their home would click on mold remediation to find out more information. SERVPRO provides detailed information about mold restoration: But that’s not all. As you can see from what I’ve highlighted on this screen, their website includes lots of other resources for visitors to click on. There is something for everyone here. They’ve got a guide about mold damage tips, odor removal, and detailed guide about black mold. This is a great example of how you can generate interest in your products or services with your website. High-quality and accurate content will make these prospective customers trust your brand. If you’re the one educating them on a topic, they’ll be more likely to buy from you over the competition. That’s why your brand needs to have a blog. It gives you an opportunity to always post fresh content on various topics related to your industry. You can publish informative guides through this distribution channel as well. While the content of each post may be different, they all need to be written with the same intention. You’re trying to guide consumers through the conversion funnel. That’s why companies that have a blog generate more leads: Your blog ends up killing two birds with one stone. Earlier I mentioned that improving your SEO efforts will help you create more brand awareness. Well, blogging is a top SEO tool. More visitors will get drawn to your website because of your blog, and ultimately that content will keep them interested as they continue through the funnel. If you want to take your content strategy to the next level, you’ll need to create as many types of content as possible. Give these visitors a reason to stay engaged. Enhance your content by building infographics and create downloadable ebooks as well. Ultimately, you can use the interest stage of your conversion funnel to collect email addresses too. Once people subscribe to receive your emails, you can use this to your advantage as they continue through the buying process. Consideration The consideration stage is very similar to the interest stage of the conversion funnel. You’ll need to provide these prospective buyers with an incentive to complete the purchase. Here’s what I mean. When they were interested, they may have done things like read your blogs, signed up for your promotional emails, or downloaded an ebook. But none of those actions generated a profit. Remember earlier I said that different people have alternative terminology for their conversion funnels? Well, I’ve seen ones that have the consideration phase labeled as “desire” instead. This makes sense, based on what you’re trying to accomplish here. You have to make your brand look even more appealing to the consumer. Here is your chance to show them why they need whatever you’re selling. The customer will weigh lots of options at this time before they decide to buy. They’ll compare things like the cost, quality, and convenience of your product or service compared to alternative solutions. This falls under the evaluation stage of the buying process: Refer to the above resource for ways to entice buyers during this stage. Lots of these suggestions relate back to what I previously discussed about generating interest. Implementing these tactics will help increase the chances that consumers will make it all the way through the conversion funnel. Finalize the sale Let’s quickly recap. First, a consumer was made aware of your brand. Then, they learned more information about what your company offers. Next, they weighed their options and considered buying from you as opposed to not buying at all or going to one of your competitors. Now, they’ve decided they wanted to buy. But that doesn’t mean they’ll do it. Sure, they may say to themselves they want what you’re selling. They might even start the checkout process. But again, the sale isn’t complete until it’s finalized. Here’s an example to illustrate my point. Let’s say a customer decides they want to buy something from your ecommerce shop. They add the item to their shopping cart. That’s great! You’re on the right track. But they never end up buying the item. What happened? For starters, you need to get familiar with the top reasons for shopping cart abandonment: Take a look at the first few results from this research. These are all things that wouldn’t have been discovered during the initial stages of the conversion funnel. You need to recognize why customers aren’t finalizing the sale and set up your checkout process accordingly to prevent this from happening in the future. Ultimately, you need to optimize every element of your checkout process for conversions. Focus on things such as: the design on each page images CTA buttons color schemes the number of steps value proposition The list goes on and on, but these are reasonable places to start. You can use tools to help you. Run A/B tests to determine the most ideal elements of your website to maximize conversions and drive more sales. Tools like this can tell you whether certain CTA phrases are more effective than others. Retain your customers Most images of conversion funnels come to an end. As we’ve seen with the funnels we looked at so far, they tend to have an upside down pyramid shape or look like a funnel (hence the name). They start wide because that’s when the prospective customer pool is the largest. But the funnel slowly narrows because you’ll lose sales along the way. Don’t worry, this is inevitable. Nobody has a 100% conversion rate. However, the idea that your funnel will continue to get smaller and smaller even after the purchase stage is a bit alarming. That would mean you’re losing customers. Obviously, you don’t want this to happen. That’s why I prefer looking at this image of the funnel to illustrate why the conversion process never ends: The process isn’t over after a new customer converts. You’ll need to come up with additional marketing campaigns to get them to continue converting in the future. It’s a constant cycle. Yes, I understand that the visual representation of the conversion funnel doesn’t actually translate to how it works. But with that said, I want to make sure you realize it’s not as simple as just a four-step process. The model of the customer conversion funnel is one of the most iconic images in marketing. As you’ve seen from everything I showed you in this guide, there are lots of different variations of this funnel and the way it works. While the terms of each stage may vary, the concepts of each one are the virtually the same. You can generate more profits by understanding the basics of each phase. Start by creating brand awareness. Then, get prospective buyers interested in your brand. Come up with a unique value proposition that makes you stand out from the crowd as the consumer enters the consideration stage. This is your chance to tell them why they need to buy. Optimize your buying process to maximize conversion rates. The funnel isn’t over after a sale is finalized. You need to nurture your customers even after they convert to ensure they continue buying in the future. These are just the basic concepts of the customer conversion funnel. We’ve barely scratched the surface here. But as a beginner, you need to familiarize yourself with the above methods and implement these strategies before you dig deeper into the funnel.

Andrew O'Reilly,"Two former CIA agents have purportedly discovered the whereabouts a sunken submarine used by late drug kingpin Pablo Escobar’s Medellín Cartel to smuggle cocaine from Colombia to Puerto Rico. In footage shot for Discovery UK, the two ex-CIA agents - Doug Laux and Ben Smith – are exploring the waters off Colombia’s Caribbean coast after receiving a tip that one of Escobar’s cocaine-filled submarines went down there. While the clip of the divers shows them digging up nothing more than a metal box, the two former agents believe that the shifting seabed and frequent hurricanes that wrack the region could have moved or obscured the wreckage. (Discovery Communications) “There are historical reports that suggest that narcos when confronted by the Navy or the Coast Guard dumped all the money and drugs overboard and fled,” Smith said in a clip posted on YouTube. “Maybe it isn’t a submarine but I can’t overlook the possibility that it could be one of those things.” Smith added: “I think it’s worth the time to go check it out.” While he started as a smalltime criminal stealing cars and selling contraband cigarettes, Escobar moved into the cocaine trade in the 1970s and by the middle of the 1980s had become the richest – and most notorious – drug capo in the world, with his Medellín Cartel bringing in a purported $22 billion a year and Forbes Magazine listing him as the world’s seventh richest person in 1989. EXPERTS DISCOVER 'CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS' ANCHOR AT CARIBBEAN SHIPWRECK SITE Deep political divides, a weak central government, rampant corruption and a decades-long civil uprising by left-wing guerrillas, all stretched Colombia’s lawmakers and military forces thin. Paired with the advent of the transnational drug trade, it was like a perfect storm to empower Escobar’s Medellín cartel to flourish. Escobar was also a Robin Hood figure is his hometown of Medellín as he built housing projects for the poor, soccer fields and other infrastructure projects. Escobar was so popular in the country that he was even elected to the Colombian Congress – a move that helped him avoid extradition to the United States. (Paul Ross for Fox News) The law eventually caught up with Escobar when he was gunned down on a Medellín rooftop in 1993 during a joint U.S.-Colombian operation. While the death El Patrón saw his drug trafficking organization go into a tailspin as turf wars broke out for control over the organization and its splinter groups with high levels of violence not abating until at least the early 2000s, what happened to Escobar’s fortune still remains a mystery. In 2009, $8 million was discovered in a hidden complex deep in the Colombian jungle, but that is only a small amount of Escobar’s purported $70 billion fortune that still remains at large.",Two former CIA agents have purportedly discovered the whereabouts a sunken submarine used by late drug kingpin Pablo Escobar’s Medellín Cartel to smuggle cocaine from Colombia to Puerto Rico.,2018-01-23T18:47:00Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}",Ex-CIA agents search for sunken cocaine submarine used by Pablo Escobar's cartel,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2018/01/23/ex-cia-agents-search-for-sunken-cocaine-submarine-used-by-pablo-escobars-cartel.html,http://www.foxnews.com//a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/science/2018/01/23/ex-cia-agents-search-for-sunken-cocaine-submarine-used-by-pablo-escobars-cartel/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1516733807709.jpg?ve=1,fox-news,Fox News,storm complex,1

Tess Wilson,"This backyard is a great size and appears to have excellent views, but it must be admitted: There's a bit more rubble than one might hope. And a few more rats than is ideal, too, apparently. That's right, rats: Our yard was a high-maintenance relic of an avid gardener. Looking for a way to hide an ugly garden shed, the previous owner thought it wise to build a six-foot concrete wall directly down the middle of the small yard. The area behind the wall had become a real-live rat's nest! We also had a small, oddly shaped nook in our side yard with no real purpose. Let's be real—simply removing the rubble and the rats will be an enormous improvement, but let's see what reader Lisa Corolla came up with. (Image credit: Lisa Carolla) This is vacation-worthy splendor! I can't believe this is Lisa's new backyard, able to be enjoyed on a regular basis. The combination of the old fences and new pergola means that there are still great views of all the surrounding trees, but there's also plenty of shade and a real feeling of privacy. (Image credit: Lisa Carolla) After a big storm took out the fence between us and our neighbors, we decided to take the opportunity to make a yard that would work for two young surfers and working professionals who like to entertain and hang out with their dog and chickens. (Image credit: Lisa Carolla) Seriously, this is fantastic. It's not over-the-top fancy, just extremely high-quality, inviting, and appealing. The many potted plants add to the vacation feel, and the pops of orange, red, and blue add a feeling of warmth and fun to the sophisticated space. And those string lights are an instant party. It's everyone's favorite place to hang out and it really does feel like we added a room to our house. All of the plants we added are in pots or large troughs, which gives us a lush look without frequent maintenance—and helps keep our chickens from destroying them all. It totally is an outdoor living room, perfect for everything from quiet reading time to tropical parties. (Image credit: Lisa Carolla) This is that odd nook that Lisa mentioned earlier, and that wheelbarrow is not just a prop: We did most of the grunt work ourselves, including making over 300 wheelbarrow trips from the front yard to the backyard to distribute granite fines. We ended up bring in a contractor to help us with the gazebo once we ran into issues with retaining walls, but are now confident in the fact that it won't be sliding into our neighbor's yard anytime soon! (Image credit: Lisa Carolla) This seemingly pointless nook has now found its purpose—it looks like it was designed specifically for this ultra-cool surf shack. That lovely wood and the colorful surfboards look amazing against the black wall. We've never had proper surfboard storage, so our surf shack and wetsuit washing station feels like such a luxury! Plus we got to use a cool hammer drill to attach it to our concrete exterior wall. The backyard was the least complex project we took on in our house renovation. If you have the physical ability, highly recommend DIY outside! The stakes are low and there are generally fewer moving parts. That is a good point: Indoor renovations usually dramatically affect your living space—hello, living without a bathroom for a month—whereas most outdoor projects wouldn't, and they generally don't involve intimidating, expensive aspects such as plumbing, electricity, and flooring.

Katherine Cross,"The 4X genre has always been held back by the logic of its imperial fantasy. You enjoy a world where decisions carry precious little weight in all but the most raw strategic terms. If you put your troops on the wrong square/hex, you may well suffer a certain kind of consequence if you’re in the midst of a war. 
Beyond that, though, the world is your silent ally, mute and immobile as you strip mine it to fund those wars. It was always a slightly aggravating thing, too neat and too pat; too flip and obvious in being a colonial fantasy. The terra is always nullius and eagerly invites your exploitation; indeed, it’s required.
There’s still a long way to go before the genre really takes its next big leap forward and meaningfully addresses that problem, but a significant step was made by Civ VI's latest expansion 'Gathering Storm.' Here, at last, the world fights back and your actions have far-reaching, unintended consequences down the ages and across the whole of the map.
A whole new world
The expansion finally introduces climate change, along with geology and weather effects (the latter actively actively exacerbated by climate change).
Now you must contend with floods, and the facts you learned in high school history about the fertile Nile River valley have finally been integrated into the game that owes so much to those heroic stories of Ancient Egypt. Rising flood waters devastate the surrounding terrain, but also fertilize it. Volcanoes erupt across the landscape. Blizzards, hurricanes, and sandstorms pummel their respective biomes. 
Gaia is back in a big way. But more than that, the world stops yielding to your will and runs out of control. 
Now the Industrial Age and all that coal you mine has a cost that will claim your low lying cities if you’re not careful. Pump enough CO2 into the air, and the ice caps will melt causing sea levels to rise incrementally until whole shorelines disappear.
From Civ's god’s eye view, you can see the sweep of climate change at a stroke -- worldwide weather, the state of your coastlines, the (often eye-popping) cost in carbon exacted by your power plants and your units. In Civ you always see its world through a spectrum of data; inputs, outputs, figures, rankings, and infrastructure. Firaxis has brilliantly turned that to its advantage by creating a credible simulation of one of our world’s most complex problems. 
In most things, Civ is an intentionally silly caricature of humanity and our history; not here.
The History of Civilization's Future
This isn’t the first time a Civ game has played with climate change, although the last time it did it was complex and unofficial. The 1999Civilization: Call to Power spinoff game, which was not owned by Firaxis and not made with Sid Meier’s blessing, has occupied a vexatious and uneasy place in Civ canon. For Civ purists, it was not Meier’s brainchild and thus verboten. For others, it had a bounty of good ideas that--it’s hard not to notice--have been integrated into later official Civ games: clearly defined national borders, advanced trade networks, specialist non-combat units, and now: sci-fi speculation and climate change.
Call to Power’s system was innovative for its day. Pollution could effectively destroy tiles if it got bad enough, and cause sea levels to rise by the mid game (CTP ran all the way into the very distant future, so the Modern Age was hardly its final act). It was, however, very simple and opaque at the same time. Civilization VI has built a whole system around climate change that clarifies a lot, while also adding many more moving parts, and illustrating the difficulty of tackling real world climate change.
Dreaming of Infrastructure
This is all to the good. Gathering Storm adds much to the game. Little things like naming rivers so they gain a bit of personality, and big things like bringing back the Giant Death Robot; more importantly, however, the latter is tied to Civ having a new Future Era that looks quite cyberpunk. Instead of the game ending in something like the present, we now embrace a sci-fi future as part of the endgame, replete with exotic technologies, futuristic governments (yet another Call to Power idea that it was time to revisit), and Blade Runner-esque skyscrapers in your cities.
""Instruct the children not to dream of toys or sweets,"" a leader in Civilization: Beyond Earth is quoted as saying. ""Instruct them to dream of infrastructure!"" He was in the wrong game. The Gathering Storm expansion adds all manner of infrastructure to the game, bringing railroads back, and adding a bevy of structures that have never before existed in Civ.
Canals have been formalized at last--the old trick of plopping a city on a narrow isthmus to create a de facto canal has finally been embraced by Firaxis and expanded upon. Canal districts let you dig further across the terrain; the Panama Canal world wonder allows you to go further still. You can connect islands with a Golden Gate Bridge, you can tunnel through mountains, you can dam up flooding rivers. And you can build tidal walls to save your sea-level cities.
Infrastructure becomes a theme in this expansion, grand projects that both shatter and save the world. This is a fantasy as well, but at least a refreshingly different one from what we’ve seen in past Civs. It at least admits that the world is destructible. The game’s resources, once static, are now consumable. You develop and consume stockpiles of, say, coal or oil, and these fuel the power plants that dramatically boost your late game production. Infrastructure binds you.
It’s a motif that reaches its highest expression in the late game when climate change really rolls in.
In Gathering Storm, climate change barrels towards you with all the mercy of a freight train. It gathers pace and then becomes all but unstoppable. Almost. But curbing your carbon output alone isn’t the solution to your problems. You also have to build. Solar farms, wind farms on and offshore, hydroelectric dams, tidal walls, sea habitats, and nuclear power stations (as well as projects to recommission them and keep them safe), a futuristic carbon recapture project. 
A massive investment in totally retooling your economy, in other words. In a strange way, it’s empowering to be able to just do that, even as real world politicians bicker over getting started in confronting our own “late game” challenges.
The right medium for the job
It’s rare for so complex an issue to lend itself so well to a video game. Often, games twist themselves into knots by mathematically simulating everything from love to survival. The end result is almost always far less than the sum of its carefully calibrated parts. But climate change is nothing if not an exponential equation. And so, suddenly, there’s a happy symmetry between medium and message.
Thee game tracks every extraction in the form of CO2 output. Everything I did, even when I thought I was being parsimonious, whether it was building that lumber mill or coal mine, was building my game up to a climactic final confrontation. Not with another civ, but with the planet itself.
There was actual stress, even on easier difficulty modes, as I raced against the clock time and again to heal the planet or at least save my own civilization. The problem was global. Isolationism wouldn’t help, military solutions would only make the problem worse (a huge navy powered by oil certainly won’t do you any favors). But the newly frenetic endgame has its seeds planted very early.
Deforesting to build your districts or build lumber mills, even in the Medieval Age, will have consequences for climate change later on. The game still bids you to follow its extractive logic, but now it makes you pay dearly.
The end result is one of the best, most accessible simulations of climate change available. Climate change is the sort of thing that, precisely because it’s so well-modelled, lends itself to interactive representation in a computer game.
Your inputs alter the world’s climate by degrees and you can see the consequences of it over the sweep of history, in a way few of us would otherwise have access to.
We often have to justify the medium’s existence -- why do such-and-such with a game when a movie or book might do? -- and while such objections are wrongheaded as a matter of principle, they wither in the face of experiments like Gathering Storm, which could only exist as a game.
***
Of course, as I said, there’s still a fantasy at work here (our tech will save us!) and a certain dark side to the ruthlessness of Civ's climate change. It’s nearly impossible to fix, short of destroying every other civ. It scales up and then it just runs and runs. Even with several of my cities running carbon recapture projects, it felt like using a bucket to bail a rapidly sinking ship. 
All you can do is hunker down and build all the infrastructure you’ll need to weather the rising seas. Eventually... they stop. The game’s algorithm runs out of sea level increments, and you are, hopefully, safe behind your sea walls. Looked at one way, it sends a painfully mixed message; optimistic in one sense, deeply fatalist in another. With each passing day it feels grimly apposite, and yet too hopeful by far.
Firaxis ended up creating a deeper text than they might have imagined.","In  Civilization VI's  latest expansion  Gathering Storm , the world fights back and your actions have far-reaching, unintended consequences down the ages and across the whole of the map.",2019-02-26T17:39:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gamasutra.com'}",Opinion: Civilization VI's (Green) New Deal,http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/336951/Opinion_Civilization_VIs_Green_New_Deal.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GamasutraFeatureArticles+%28Gamasutra+Feature+Articles%29,http://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/news/2019/Feb/336951/civ thumb.jpg,,Gamasutra.com,storm complex,1
Abby Vesoulis,"The bizarre pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory has burst from fringe websites into the real world this week, as dozens of attendees at two recent Trump rallies in Florida and Pennsylvania promoted it. “It’s a movement, man. It’s the shift. I can feel it coming,” one Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania rally-goer told CNN on Thursday. “Some call it the great awakening,” he added. The theory, which originated from anonymous messages posted online, purports to explain everything from the sinking of the Titanic to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, weaving them into a grand narrative where President Donald Trump is a secret mastermind – and hero. QAnon’s online clues — called “breadcrumbs” — are so vague, they can be hard to follow. But there has been no evidence to prove them. At a press conference on Wednesday White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders denied that Trump supports the group, “The President condemns and denounces any group that would incite violence against another individual, and certainly doesn’t support groups that would promote that type of behavior,” she said. Footage from Trump’s rally in Tampa on Tuesday and a rally in Pennsylvania on Thursday shows attendees wearing T-shirts and carrying posters with the letter “Q” — a shorthand to identify followers of the conspiracy theory. Here’s what experts say you need to know about QAnon and why the conspiracy theory has spread. How did QAnon’s theories spread? Conspiracies take off because the world is complex and people like things to make sense, according to Brooke Binkowski, former managing editor at the fact-checking website Snopes.com, which frequently debunks online theories. “Conspiracy theories offer a neat package that wrap up all these events,” she says. Sometimes, conspiracy theories can be debunked before they draw national attention. This is especially true when the source of the false information is identifiable and can be approached and corrected, Binkowski says. But when theories explode on platforms with anonymous posters — like 4chan, one of the sites where QAnon started — Binkowski says they can be much harder to stop. “You don’t know who is spreading [the conspiracies] and why, or who is picking them up and why,” she says. “You can’t really confront the people who are responsible for these to their face or on social media, because you don’t know who is doing it.” Is the QAnon conspiracy theory dangerous? Before their recent appearance at Trump rallies, QAnon conspiracy theorists have mostly stayed online – at the fringes of most mainstream message boards and social media platforms. Though an armed man with an armored truck did block a highway near the Hoover Dam in June with a sign reading “Release the OIG report,” a demand that was prominent among QAnon followers. But experts warn that conspiracy theories can lead followers to more dangerous behavior. That happened in December 2016, when a 28-year-old North Carolina man, who believed a conspiracy theory — one that is still spread by QAnon followers — showed up at a Washington, D.C. pizzeria where he believed children were being harbored because of baseless claims relating to Hillary Clinton’s, John Podesta. The “Pizzagate” believer fired several shots from an AR-15 rifle, though nobody was injured. More recently, an Arizona man used an armored vehicle to block traffic on the bridge near the Hoover Dam has used QAnon phrases in letters he wrote from jail to Trump and other elected officials. Binkowski says she thinks the QAnon conspiracy theory could lead followers to commit acts of violence if they became convinced it was the only way to stop some imminent harm. How can this kind of conspiracy theory be stopped? The best way to stop the spread of misinformation is through the pursuit of actual information, according to psychologist Michael Wood, who specializes in the psychology of conspiracies and is a lecturer at the University of Winchester. “If you hear a claim, even if it fits with the rest of what you believe or it sounds appealing, really think hard about whether it makes sense,” Wood says. “It’s very easy to think critically about things you already disagree with — the trick is to think critically about things that flatter what you believe.” What role has President Trump played in QAnon? The QAnon conspiracy may have gotten started when Trump made an off-hand remark about the “calm before the storm,” but the President appears to have no personal ties to the people behind it. However, some say Trump’s repeated endorsements of other conspiracy theories – for example those about Barack Obama’s birth certificate, Ted Cruz’s citizenship and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s death – have helped lay the ground for more dangerous conspiracy theories like QAnon. “Trump hasn’t talked about Q specifically, but the popularity of Q probably owes something to Trump’s general usage of conspiracy theories — on the campaign trail, in speeches, in tweets and so on,” Wood says. “People’s idea of what are acceptable political beliefs depends, to some extent, on what kind of cues they get from political elites. Trump is, by usual standards of U.S. politics, quite a conspiracy theorist. So it makes sense that his base has followed suit.” But Binkowski noted that people of any political persuasion can fall victim to conspiracy theories. “Authoritarian conspiracy theories can prey on anyone across the political spectrum,” she says, adding that she doesn’t think “who is doing it really cares about politics so much as they care about control of power, and division and separation.”",Followers made themselves known at two recent rallies for President Trump,2018-08-03T19:21:01Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Here’s Why Experts Worry About the Popularity of QAnon’s Conspiracy Theory,http://time.com/5356851/what-is-qanon/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/trump-rally-qanon.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,storm complex,1

"Feliz Solomon / Tham Luang Cave, Thailand","Stakes were raised Friday in the desperate effort to rescue 13 people trapped in a cave in northern Thailand as news that a former Thai Navy SEAL died on the mission was delivered under approaching storm clouds. Thai authorities said the retired diver, 38-year-old Petty Officer Samarn Kunan, was volunteering to help distribute oxygen tanks throughout the flooded tunnels when he ran out of air for himself. The first casualty of a mission that has gone on for almost two weeks has underscored the dangers of a plan to extract the group by teaching them to dive. But heavy rains are expected to resume in the coming days, while oxygen inside the cave has dropped to concerning levels. Authorities said Friday that a tube is being laced through the flooded passages to allow more oxygen in, but expressed for the first time that a back-up plan to keep them inside for months if necessary may not be viable. “This mission is very tough,” Navy SEAL Commander Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yukongkaew told reporters under the thick clouds that gathered after two crucial days of sunshine that allowed some water to be pumped out. “We thought they would be able to stay there for a while, but conditions have changed and we have limited time.” Read more: Grandfather of Trapped Thai Boy Says He’ll ‘Never Let Them Near a Cave Again’ Twelve boys between the ages of 11 and 16, members of the Wild Boars soccer team, and their 25-year-old coach were trapped inside Tham Luang cave, one of Thailand’s longest and most complex, on June 23 when sudden rains flooded their exit. The team was planning to have a birthday picnic for one of the players after practice. None of them know how to swim. A monumental search effort involving more than 1,000 people and aided by at least seven foreign governments ended in a burst of jubilation late Monday when a pair of British divers found all 13 alive and in stable health. But the days since have been a rollercoaster of hope and anxiety as authorities weigh extraction plans, each uniquely perilous. Rescuers are now in a race against time to get them all out before further complications. Weather conditions will be the determining factor in which method of escape is pursued — authorities are weighing three far-from-perfect options of either giving the boys a crash course in cave diving; widening existing holes in the cave’s ceiling and pulling them out from above; or resupplying them with food and other essentials for as long as it takes for waters to recede. Even delivering provisions is difficult and could be further complicated by more rains. It takes expert divers roughly six hours to reach the trapped group from a Navy command center that has been set up about a mile deep inside the cave. They take another five hours to return in the fast-moving currents through pitch-black tunnels studded with stalactites and loaded with sharp turns. Divers have to remove equipment to squeeze through some narrow openings, while a few have already been widened to allow easier passage. “The visibility in the water is still very bad,” Ivan Karadzic, a Danish diver volunteering on the mission, tells TIME. Expert cave divers who have spent thousands of hours underwater find the trip arduous. “Teaching the kids to dive is simple, but keeping them submerged for hours is going to be very complicated.” It may still be the best option. Karadzic says local children from nearby villages have volunteered for test dives in lakes and rivers near the site, where rescuers are experimenting with options. They could try to push and pull the boys through the tunnels, with two or three SEALs helping each one navigate. At this desperate stage, all options are on the table. It’s too early to attempt a dive as the boys are malnourished after surviving on only a few snacks made to last the nine days it took rescuers to find them. Video released by the Royal Thai Navy showed them gaunt and wrapped in heat-retaining blankets. The Governor of Chiang Rai province, Narongsak Osottanakorn, said Thursday that three of them are still very weak but in stable condition. Helicopters circled overhead as light rain fell in the early afternoon, still searching for alternative entries. Police and soldiers patrol the jungle overhead for chimneys and fissures that could be widened enough to drop supplies and climbers down into the chamber as reality sets in that the boys and their coach cannot stay where they are indefinitely. “These conditions are unprecedented,” Karadzic said. “To my knowledge, there has never been a situation like this before.”","Heavy rains are expected to resume in the coming days, while oxygen levels inside the cave have dropped to concerning levels",2018-07-06T07:42:25Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",‘We Have Limited Time.’ Thai Authorities Race Against the Rains to Free Soccer Team Trapped in a Cave,http://time.com/5331594/thailand-cave-rescue-seal-death-rains/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/rts1v7fz.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,storm complex,1
"Mira Brancu, Ph.D.","Here I am in North Carolina, closely tracking the progress of Hurricane Florence. Her name sounds so calm, harkening the well-known founder of nursing. Though, I must say that while we like to think of Florence Nightingale as the nurturer of soldiers, she was quite a force to be reckoned with. So, I suppose the namesake is not lost on me right now. During times of impending crisis - whether it be economic, natural disaster, or a major company decline - the media likes to focus most heavily on how leaders perform under pressure to shore up hope, get people focused on one mission, or lead a group through the crisis. You rarely hear anything about the difficult decisions these leaders had to make to manage their personal and other obligations outside of that specific role. We often think of leadership as a role you have in one setting. In fact, it’s often the case that if you are leadership material, you serve in multiple leadership roles, both officially (at work) and unofficially (in your community, at home). We also often think of leadership under crisis as requiring one specific type of leadership style or response. In fact, different situations require different responses and styles: transactional vs. transformational, communal vs agentic... I’ll leave the definitions for another post, but needless to say, there are many leadership styles that work well under different conditions. For women leaders, it may be even more complicated given how we often feel a deep sense of responsibility to our children, employees, bosses, and our community. Women are constantly juggling multiple leadership identities. Further compounding it is that the cultural revolution of women working full-time and in leadership roles in the workplace has not been matched by a cultural revolution of rebalancing the gender role expectations at home (first described in Hochschild, 1989). We’re expected to be leaders everywhere or otherwise, let go of our profession. We have it all! We can be it all! Nice one, society. In my case, for example, yesterday: In my VA role, (1) I was working with my boss and administrative staff to decide what our emergency and management plan was going to be for our employees in the face of the incoming storm and (2) (supposedly at the same time) traveling to Washington, DC for a project. In my non-profit board member role, (3) I was (supposed to) help the group finalize a grant submission. In my family role my husband and I were trying to decide (4) whether to evacuate the state, (5) whether to take my parents with us (kicking and screaming and against their stubborn will), (6) when to feed the kids, (7) who would pick up one child and bring them to their gymnastics lesson (and whether that would happen or we would pack up and go), (8) whether we had all the emergency things we needed one way or another, (9) was there enough gas in the car (No, there wasn’t and all the gas stations had been emptied)…. and on and on. Some of the above are the normal work-life juggling we all seem to struggle with on a daily basis. But added to that are necessary questions of how leaders make decisions in different aspects of their lives that are affected by multiple competing priorities, and in the face of an impending crisis that will affect each one. In my case: Do I go to DC, but then be separated from the family for a potentially extended period of time with an unknown outcome about their safety and mine? Do I prioritize my own family evacuation plans over the need to be present and available at work to ensure smooth management of emergency plans at work for all the employees? Who gets my attention first? Does anyone NOT get my attention? There are many models of the work-life balance, including the spillover (one part spills over into the other), compensation (what you lack in one part of life you can find in another part of life) and instrumental (each part of life can help you be successful in another) models. In a crisis situation, the conflict model seems to fit best : when all aspects of life simultaneously present high levels of demand and force leaders to make difficult choices in the face of emotional and cognitive overload. How do women leaders make these decisions? There is almost no research on this. One of the few articles touching on this topic was by Loder (2005), who conducted a qualitative study of 31 Black and White women educational administrators of different generations. Loder found that how women administrators managed these conflicts of competing roles (administrator, wife, mother, caretaker ) was informed by their unique generational and racial/ethnic identities. For example, women from older generations more often prioritized family above professional pursuits than their younger counterparts, and Black administrators relied more on extended family and friendship support to manage competing demands, whereas White administrators leaned more heavily on spousal/partner support. While we wait for more research, as a leader here are some questions to ask yourself to plan ahead of a crisis. You may want to discuss and share these ideas with all the people in your life to whom you are responsible and in a leadership role (officially and unofficially): Consider your own values and beliefs as a guide. For example, does family always come first? Are there times when it can wait? Who or what would you need to prioritize in different kinds of crisis? Which commitments would be okay to break? Think about this in terms of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. While you are more than capable of addressing higher order needs for yourself and others when things are going well (i.e., nurturing yours and others’ need for self-esteem, love, and belonging), times of crisis often require a heavier emphasis on re-establishing basic lower order priorities of safety, shelter, food, and sleep. Once you have a sense of the priority of needs, communicate these clearly to those whom you feel most obligated and share your reasoning. (E.g., “Mommy needs to go to the hospital because right now there are sick people who still need care and I need to make sure they get help. Grandma is here to take care of you until I return.”) Can you rely on someone else to make certain decisions for you (delegate) or withyou ( collaborate /partner)? You don’t have to shoulder all burdens on your own, nor would that be very effective leadership. Make a list of who you can delegate to and who you can lean on for support and communicate with each what you need to make sure everything gets taken care of. Be okay with NOT being everything to everyone. Women especially have a tendency to fall into this trap even in non-crisis times. During a crisis, this belief of doing it all is the least helpful and is likely to create more unnecessary conflict (internally and externally) and less effective leadership. Remember that while you will always be judged by one group or another for not doing enough in their eyes, you ultimately still have to live with yourself at the end of the day and you must feel good about the difficult decisions you had to make. Knowing what your own values, beliefs, and priorities are ahead of time – and then making decisions that are in line with those - can help you better execute the plan, ensure success, or make peace with the outcome.

"Feliz Solomon / Tham Luang Cave, Thailand","It was supposed to be a special day for Night. On June 23, his 16th birthday, family members came over to cook while he went off to soccer practice with his best friends, Tle, Nick and Note. After practice, they and the rest of their team, the Wild Boars, hopped on their bicycles and rode off for what was meant to be a half-day adventure. “He’s a good boy, the only thing he cares about is soccer,” his grandfather, Sriward Sompiengjai, tells TIME at the compound in the northern Thai village of Vieng Hom, where the four boys live. A birthday cake still waits in the refrigerator for the young athlete, whose given name is Pheeraphat Sompiengjai. It may be waiting for a long time. Twelve days after the team of boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old assistant coach wandered into the nearby Tham Luang cave, Thai authorities are pooling all available resources to try to get them out. They were already more than a mile deep into the complex when heavy rains swept through the tunnels and trapped them inside, setting off a monumental search and rescue effort involving more than a thousand people aided by at least seven foreign governments, including the U.S. A small tent city has since sprung up in a muddy field near the mouth of the cave, where 13 ambulances are standing by to rush them to the Chiang Rai regional hospital. Volunteers camp out at the site, cooking, keeping the grounds clean, giving haircuts and massages to the rescuers. “I’m very proud, and I was surprised,” Sriward says of the sudden support. “It shows that Thai people do not abandon each other.” The dramatic search at times felt hopeless; drones and helicopters scoured the mountain for alternative entries, while divers delved day and night through dark, dirty water for nine days with no sign of the group since their disappearance. But on Monday night, Sriward and his family jumped up from their seats in disbelief as news broke on TV that the 12 boys and their coach had all been found alive. For a few short hours the nation rejoiced that the search had ended. But the rescue is just beginning. It could take days, weeks, even months to extract the boys, who cannot swim, and their coach, Ekkapol Chantawong. The governor of Chiang Rai province, Narongsak Osottanakorn, told reporters Wednesday that his preferred plan is to wait until water levels drop enough for the group to simply walk out the way they came. But with the monsoon rains approaching and tunnels still flooded, that day could be a long way off. “I think it’s impossible,” says Captain Wuttichai, who commands a unit of Thai Navy SEALs on the frontline of the rescue effort. “They need to learn how to dive.” Read more: What It Was Like in Thailand When Rescuers Found the Soccer Team Trapped in a Cave Following a medical assessment, SEALs began giving the boys basic lessons Wednesday. They have already tried on diving masks but have yet to jump into the muddy water that corralled them on a dry rock 12 days ago. Videos released by the Royal Thai Navy show the boys in good spirits but in weak condition; they had only a few snacks to last them the nine days it took rescuers to find them and are visibly frail. Wuttichai says it would likely take at least another day before they will be ready to begin training in earnest, but once they begin they’ll learn fast. They may have to — if water levels don’t recede and they cannot swim their way out, they could be trapped inside until the monsoon season ends in September. Skies were blue Thursday for the second day in a row, presenting a brief window to pump out as much water as possible. Giant pipes spilling out of the cave’s mouth and plugged into holes drilled through the hillside kept gushing water out into the farmlands below. Levels crept slightly downward, but a single storm could set back the rescue for weeks. Alternative exits are being considered through chimneys above, which could be widened to allow climbers in and out. But entire new roads would likely have to be built to bring the equipment to the precise fissures in the jungle that drop down into the complex. Suggesting a long wait ahead, divers are being trained to install fiber-optic cable from a Navy command station inside the tunnels to allow the boys to talk to their parents. “All options are being explored,” says Captain Jessica Tait, a spokesperson for the U.S. Air Force, who arrived on June 28 with a survival specialist and a team of pararescuemen — an elite special operations unit trained for search, rescue and medical response in almost any environment. The pararscuers, whose training is so rigorous it’s known as “Superman School,” will remain on the ground to advise and assist Thai authorities in their uniquely difficult mission. “These children had been in a cave for nine days, so you have to consider the physiological and psychological things that the kids are going through,” Capt. Tait tells TIME. “Nothing is off the table.” The 12-day whirlwind of blind hope and anxiety has gripped the nation and much of the wider world. Hundreds of journalists rushed to the scene to broadcast the slightest developments. Hill tribe shamans trekked from nearby villages, sacrificing live animals to a mountain spirit in exchange for the boys’ safety. At their school, in the district of Mae Sai bordering Myanmar, classmates pray to see them again. When they were finally found by a pair of British divers setting guide ropes Monday, parents burst into tears. Details began to emerge this week about how the team survived. Ekkapol, the coach, is said to be in the weakest condition after forgoing food for the kids. Citing a Thai SEAL who made contact with the team, local news site Khaosod reported that he rationed their food, collected clean water and advised them to lie still. A translator for a team of six Chinese divers on the mission told TIME that Ekkapol, who like most Thais is a devout Buddhist, is believed to have led them in long meditation. Sriward, Night’s grandfather, says he will become a monk when the boy is safely home. And the Wild Boars? “I’ll never let any of them near a cave again,” he says.",The 12-day whirlwind of blind hope and anxiety has gripped the nation and much of the wider world,2018-07-05T05:30:07Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Grandfather of Trapped Thai Boy Says He’ll ‘Never Let Them Near a Cave Again’,http://time.com/5330668/thailand-cave-rescue-diving/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/rts1v587.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,storm complex,1
Jen Schwartz,"The National Flood Insurance Program, which covers some 5.2 million property holders in the U.S., was slated to get a badly needed overhaul today. The Senate’s task—which includes hammering out reforms that address the changing math of flood risk—has already been pushed back three times since November. Yet lawmakers still have not compromised on how to fix a broken system, so a reauthorization of the NFIP will almost certainly be punted again, to July 31. The NFIP, which is run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is struggling because it is trapped in a downward spiral of ballooning claims without the resources to cover them. The program has been unable to sustain itself since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, but last fall, after a hurricane season that was unprecedented in both severity and frequency, administrators announced the program had maxed out the $30.4 billion it had been authorized to borrow from the U.S. Treasury. Although Pres. Donald Trump signed a disaster relief bill that forgave $16 billion of its debt, the NFIP continues to be steamrolled by extreme weather events, including the recent series of back-to-back nor’easters that have clobbered the Northeast. In its current form, the NFIP is “ill-suited to deal with the challenges we face today and the flood risks we face five, 10, 50 years from now,” says Robert Moore, a senior policy analyst at the National Resources Defense Council. Pretty much everyone agrees this is true, regardless of party politics. In fact, SmarterSafer, a collation made up of insurance companies, progressive environmental organizations and right-leaning think tanks, is one group advocating for sweeping change ( pdf ). Among the major reasons why the NFIP cannot keep up with the growing number of claims is that it assesses risk based on outdated science. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy it became widely known FEMA was demarcating flood zones using data from the 1980s, which failed to predict the inundations brought by the 2012 storm. Meanwhile development continues to bloom in increasingly vulnerable floodplains, creating more properties that the NFIP pays to repair—sometimes over and over again. Since the chaos of Sandy, a growing number of researchers have analyzed flood risk on a more comprehensive and granular level. Their results have exposed an even more troubling gap between FEMA guidelines and recent estimations of risk. One study, published in Environmental Research Letters last month ( pdf ), found the number of Americans exposed to serious flooding is about three times higher than previous estimates. That is partly because inland flooding is not as well considered as coastal flooding. According to the paper, maps delineating riverine and rainfall-driven flooding “are only partially complete nationwide, and no comprehensive estimate of U.S. population exposure currently exists. Where they are available, FEMA flood maps are of varying age and levels of quality.” They also have “notably poor coverage” of streams and creeks. According to FEMA’s calculations, only 13 million people live within a 100-year-flood zone (that is, a place that has a one-in-100 chance in a given year of being hit with the worst flood in a century). But by doing a comprehensive evaluation of floods driven by rivers and rainfall and creating higher-resolution maps, the authors reported nearly 41 million people in the U.S. live within a 100-year-flood zone. In another example of glaring discrepancies, a 2016 study by Robert Criss of Washington University in Saint Louis found current estimates of 100-year-flood elevations could be off by as much as 6.6 feetin parts of the Upper Mississippi River. Numbers like these imply that many more Americans should be buying flood insurance, which would bring in more premium dollars to the program. Sea-level rise, coupled with other factors such as shifts in wave action and storm surges, is changing those numbers, too. By 2050, according to a recent article in Nature, “some places can expect to see what is currently considered a 100-year-flood event recur as often as every one or five years on average.” FEMA mostly uses models based on historical storm data, which, of course, do not account for these predicted effects of climate change. “One of the biggest problems is that no flood map produced by FEMA contemplates a future that looks any different from the past,” Moore says. FEMA, for its part, is self-aware about its woeful maps; the NFIP’s chief, Roy Wright, recently told the Miami Herald that all Floridians should have flood insurance and “quit focusing just on the lines.” For a while some legislators suggested they were wary of changing flood-insurance standards because there was not enough data to draw on. Now, “the science is already much, much further ahead than what FEMA is working with,” says Thomas Wahl, a coastal engineer and oceanographer at the University of Central Florida. Wahl published a paper in Nature Communications in 2015 on the effects of compound flooding, which is when increased river discharge, precipitation and storm surges happen at the same time. This helped drown communities near Houston during Hurricane Harvey. From Wahl’s perspective, “the biggest gap is the fact that FEMA’s maps do not connect inland flooding and coastal flooding,” he says. “FEMA creates a flat map from the river side of things and a flat map from the storm surge side of things, and they just overlay them, which assumes that these two things are completely independent. But most tropical storms bring a lot of rain and storm surges. We understand why these events happen simultaneously, but what we haven’t done is include that information into risk assessments,” Wahl notes. Some of that backlog is bureaucratic: FEMA only uses officially approved models, he says, and the processes of approval can slow down the inclusion of newer, better data. Without a better understanding of the true risks, it is trickier for lawmakers to agree on solutions for how to make the NFIP financially stable. As a growing body of research illuminates the current and future scope of flooding, adaptation strategies are beginning to look more attractive than the traditional (and bankrupting) cycle of rebuilding. In addition to making building codes stronger, installing hard flood barriers and funding projects such as raising homes on pilings, the once-disparaged concept of “buyouts” is slowly being embraced. Instead of repairing certain homes that flood over and over again, the government “buys out” your property at its pre-storm value using NFIP money, then permanently returns the land to nature. This more radical option gets people out of harm’s way and can be cheaper than repeatedly paying to repair the same property. The NRDC, for one, is advocating for a better pathway to buyouts as part of NFIP reform. Uprooting from home is an emotionally and financially complex decision, but people who are repeatedly flooded seem to be growing more open-minded to relocation strategies. Take Harris County, Texas, for example. Prior to Hurricane Harvey, “the county had purchased 3,000 flood-prone homes over 20 years” in buyout programs, Moore says. “After Harvey hit they had 3,800 new application requests for home buyouts in just eight weeks.” The governor of Texas requested $1.5 billion from the federal government for buyouts alone. But FEMA’s buyout process can take years to complete. In the aftermath of a disaster, homeowners often face an onerous choice: Hold off on repairs and live in limbo while awaiting a verdict on whether they qualify for a buyout or start investing in reconstruction so they have a place to live in the interim. The slowness and opacity of the buyout process disincentivizes many eligible homeowners from participating. Streamlining the buyout option could make those decisions easier while improving the long-term financial viability of the NFIP. According to data the NRDC obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, FEMA has identified about 30,000 “severe repetitive loss properties” that get routinely flooded and repaired. Of those properties, more than 60 percent are worth less than $250,000, with the average price being $110,000. “These severe repetitive-loss properties have already incurred an average of $145,000 in damages” that the NFIP has paid out, Moore says. So in many cases, “we’ve already bought their properties.” Incorporating recent research into the NFIP could help establish a framework for identifying which properties and communities are most vulnerable to repetitive flooding and create more efficient standards to determine buyout eligibility. Armed with more knowledge about how often their houses might flood over the life of a mortgage, homeowners could make informed decisions. Communities, too, might preemptively plan how to relocate families, mitigating psychological and financial stress while also maintaining their tax bases. That way, when catastrophic damage occurs the response is not purely reactive. While the particulars of insurance reform are still being determined, one thing that is for certain is that flood risk is going up. “I believe we have the science now that we can inform policy makers much better than we could several years ago,” Wahl says. “It’s very site-specific and there is still uncertainty, but we are seeing disasters strike all the time, so I think we are at the point where we can make some decisions.” If, in July, reform gets kicked down the road yet again, it might only take one expensive hurricane to force Congress to decide whether they must increase the NFIP’s borrowing limit beyond $30.4 billion or forgive even more debt, Moore says. Alternatively, Congress could try to force the Senate’s hand to pass a bill on July 31 by allowing the NFIP to lapse. In that case, the NFIP’s ability to borrow money would plummet to a cap of $1 billion and homeowners would not be able to renew their policies—a precarious scenario at the start of hurricane season.",The FEMA program will continue to be financially unviable until it uses the latest research to help fix its broken system -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2018-03-23T13:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",National Flood Insurance Is Underwater Because of Outdated Science,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/national-flood-insurance-is-underwater-because-of-outdated-science/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/635053A8-7D6C-46FE-9CEFE1516CA08E75_agenda.jpg?w=600&h=335,,Scientificamerican.com,storm complex,1
"USA TODAY, Rick Hampson, USA TODAY","An explosive wildfire closed down dozens of miles of a major California freeway. The Delta Fire erupted Wednesday afternoon and within hours devoured nearly 8 square miles on both sides of Interstate 5 near the Oregon state line. (Sept. 6) AP Firefighters tried to control a back burn late last month as the Carr fire continued to consume acre after acre in northern California. The fire is one of many natural disasters that have riveted Americans this summer. The Carr fire was notable for what was described as a ""fire volcano'' in the city of Redding with a diameter the size of three football fields. (Photo: MARK RALSTON, AFP/Getty Images) Will repeated exposure to vivid scenes of natural disaster — Western wildfires, a global heat wave, Hawaiian volcano eruptions, the 2017 hurricanes’ anniversary and a suddenly active 2018 season — finally turn America into a go-bag nation, prepared for calamity and ready to flee it? Experience counsels skepticism. So does human nature. The sight of a 30-story-high wave of fire consuming a Colorado subdivision, or a California “fire tornado” as long as three football fields, may rivet a national audience. But it probably won’t change national attitudes about how to prepare for an emergency or when to evacuate. Experts say people aren’t really motivated by disaster until it comes to, or through, their door. “I don’t know what it’ll take,’’ says Jay Baker, a retired Florida State University geographer who has studied evacuation behavior, “but disaster scenes are not enough.’’ More: Tropical Storm Florence creeps closer to US, to head toward East Coast as major hurricane Take the case of Lauren Sand. When she was a kid her family built a house on the west side of Los Angeles. This was shortly after the Bel Air Fire of 1961, one of worst wildfires in California history. When she moved into the neighborhood, the hillsides were still charred. On the next ridge, a row of chimneys marked where houses had stood before the fire. As an adult, Sand created Grabbit the rabbit, a cartoon mascot for emergency preparedness. She marketed Grabbit-themed products, such as a kids’ backpack stuffed with necessities for a quick escape. But last December, when a pre-dawn wildfire came roaring toward the same home where she grew up, Sand was taken by surprise. She learned of the fire only when a friend saw it from the freeway and called to warn her. Sand grabbed her laptop, purse, phone and some papers, and hopped into her car. When she looked in the mirror, she saw a wall of black smoke rolling down the street. She gunned her Prius like it was a Maserati. She escaped, but without a coat, toothbrush, cherished family records and photos, and the architectural plans for her house (which, unlike several on the street, was spared). She left the pool uncovered and found it, when she was able to return three days later, filled with ashes. Grabbit would not be impressed. One of several homes destroyed by a wildfire on Lauren Sand's street in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles last December. The pre-dawn blaze raced up a hillside before most residents realized they were in danger. No one was killed, but few were prepared. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) A land of natural hazards America is riddled with fault lines and bordered by storm-tossed oceans, with two great north-south mountain ranges but none running east-west to keep Arctic air from flowing south and tropical air from going north. There are hurricanes in the Southeast and nor'easters in the Northeast; tornadoes on the lower Plains and blizzards on the upper Plains; earthquakes and volcanoes along the Pacific Coast, which also is vulnerable to tsunamis; sinkholes and lightning in Florida; avalanches in the Rockies and flash floods in the Appalachians; hail from Minnesota to Texas and ice storms from Wyoming to Maine; lake-effect snow from the Great Lakes and the Great Salt Lake; and monsoons in Arizona. In the first half of this year, six natural disasters each caused at least $1 billion damage and killed a total of 36 people. This came after 2017, the costliest year on record. It included California’s Wine Country fires, which killed 44 and destroyed 10,000 homes; Washington State blazes that dumped ash on Seattle like snow and pushed the air quality index in Spokane to “hazardous;’’ and three hurricanes — Harvey, Irma and Marie — so bad their names were retired. Global warming makes wildfires hotter and probably will make hurricanes bigger. And the number of people living in harm’s way, including active earthquake and volcano zones, is increasing. Yet, as FEMA administrator Brock Long observed this year, America lacks a ""culture of preparedness.’’ We mostly don’t stock up on batteries, candles and water; we don’t prepare a family emergency plan or buy a hand-cranked radio; we don’t listen carefully to warnings and often don’t understand them when we do. Or obey them. A survey in Florida after Hurricane Irma by Mason-Dixon polling found that only 43% of those under mandatory evacuation orders actually evacuated. Plumes rise where lava pours into the sea from Kilauea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii last month. The eruption has destroyed more than 700 homes. It's just one of many natural disasters grabbing Americans' attention this summer. (Photo: USGS via AFP/Getty Images) A 2015 study by the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University found that two-thirds of Americans said they were not prepared to evacuate in an emergency. But Irwin Redlener, the center’s director, believes the situation is actually worse. Sometimes, when he’s speaking to groups of emergency preparedness specialists, he’ll ask how many have a personal or family evacuation plan. Only a few hands go up, and most of their plans turn out to be half-basked. Redlener thinks he knows why: It’s hard. A plan sounds like a good idea until, say, you face the question of what to do about your kids at school in case of a disaster. Do you go get them? Does your spouse? Traveling could be risky, so what are the school’s plans in an emergency? And how do you find out? Suddenly, you notice the lawn needs mowing. Last year two Wharton business school professors, Howard Kunreuther and Robert Meyer, published The Ostrich Paradox: Why We Underprepare for Disasters. They identify six unconscious biases that undercut our ability and willingness to prepare. 1. Myopia: We focus on the short term and have difficulty understanding long-term consequences, such as the 100-year flood. 2. Amnesia : We forget the past. We buy a condo in complex built where a storm once blew away a shopping center. 3. Inertia: We do what we’re doing until something drastic happens, when it’s too late. See New Orleans and Katrina in 2005. 4. Selectivity : We don’t look at all the information, or simplify to the point of inaccuracy. If we have an emergency check list, we lose interest after covering a few items, without making sure they were the most important. 5. Herding : We make choices based on what the other person is doing. And so we both wind up treading water. 6. Optimism : This most American of traits leads us to underestimate risk, ignore worst-case scenarios and think bad things will only happen to others. It’s a great attitude for someone starting a business, not so much for someone living in a flood zone. There are others factors, such as cost. Some people living in disaster-prone areas don’t move because they can’t afford to. Even assembling a comprehensive go-bag can be prohibitively expensive for some families. And there’s always sheer ignorance. Many people living along the New Jersey coast during Superstorm Sandy in 2012 had no idea what hurricanes do to barrier islands until they found their roads clogged with four feet of sand. A hard habit to change Viral internet images and nonstop TV news coverage of this year’s disasters and disaster anniversaries have inspired some hope that Americans will begin to focus more on preparing for emergencies, rather than just reacting to them. But Baker, the evacuation expert, says there’s little evidence that evacuation behavior is influenced by such things. In 2005 he was conducting a survey of public evacuation attitudes on Long Island when Katrina struck New Orleans. He assumed that news of the disaster would ruin his study, skewing Long Islanders’ attitudes artificially and temporarily. Instead, he got the same kinds of responses after the storm as before it. He says most people won’t change unless they’ve experienced something like a living room with six feet of water. But many Americans never face anything more perilous than a thunderstorm or a blizzard. A New York Times analysis this year of Small Business Administration data concluded that a relatively small part of the country has sustained most of the damage from major natural disasters; about 90% of the losses occurred in ZIP codes with less than 20% of the population. The Wharton professors called their book The Ostrich Paradox because of a common misimpression. The bird reacts to danger not by sticking its head in the sand — the way many humans deal figuratively with the prospect of natural disaster — but by running at speeds of up to 43 mph. That was about how fast Lauren Sand was driving when she fled the wildfire last December. Now, despite the expert pessimism, she thinks attitudes can change. “Everyone feels vulnerable,’’ she says, “not invincible anymore.’’ More: Rare volcanic 'fire tornado' caught on camera Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2N2mQIM",Americans are being blanketed by scenes of natural mayhem this summer.

Scott Davis,"After the Golden State Warriors self-financed the $1.4 billion Chase Center, their new home in San Francisco starting next season, team president Rick Welts says he believes sports arenas should receive public funding. 
 ""Personal opinion: I actually think these are amazing cultural institutions that allow the city to have a better quality of life and a certainly more varied cultural offering by having this,"" Welts told Business Insider. 
 ""I think there's every justification for cities investing or states or counties or whatever entity investing in these facilities because I think they actually enhance the quality of life."" 
 San Francisco does not allow sports teams to use public money to fund arenas, according to Welts. He said the Warriors were aware of this before their move. 
Read more: Take a look at the Warriors' new $1.4 billion San Francisco arena — what's said to be the nicest arena in sports
 The debate over public funding for sports arenas and stadiums has been a heated one for years. Supporters often argue that pro sports teams and arenas can be good for cities, creating jobs, encouraging spending from locals and tourists alike, and creating an intangible sense of community. 
 Opponents argue that the economic benefits are over-stated — the jobs created are part-time, seasonal, and low-paying. Previous studies found that arenas didn't really add much to local economies. 
 Could that change with more teams building arenas in city centers? The Milwaukee Bucks built their new, $500 million arena Fiserv Forum — which received $250 million in public funds — in downtown Milwaukee, with their president Peter Feigin saying it became a ""catalyst"" in reviving the area. 
 Chase Center is situated in the neighborhood of Mission Bay, an industrial, growing area. Welts said he believes arenas belong in urban centers and can increase the quality of life in those places. 
 ""These are meant to be urban things,"" Welts said of arenas. ""That's where they add most to the quality of life to the city. I think the most successful ones are located in really dense urban areas. We love that ... I think they're part of the fabric of a city."" 
Chase Center will feature office space, retail stores and restaurants, a public park, and more.
 via Chase Center 
Like Fiserv Forum, Chase Center features an outdoor complex with retail stores and restaurants and a public park the Warriors hope will attract visitors year-round, not just for games. 
 Opponents of using public money to fund arenas also point to the rising value of sports franchises. Forbes found the average NBA franchise to be worth $1.9 billion, up 13% from last year, and three times as valuable as they were five years ago. 
 Despite this, Welts said it would be unwise for other teams to self-finance their arenas, arguing the Warriors had a confluence of events that made it possible. 
 ""We really have such a unique intersection of circumstances on this project that you could never, as a business planner, with a straight face, replicate,"" Welts said. 
Rick Welts has overseen the construction of Chase Center.

Welts said between the Warriors competing for championships and the booming tech economy and wealth in the Bay Area, the Warriors were able to afford a $1.4 billion project, knowing the cost was worth it, and they could make the money back. 
 ""We have like a perfect storm. We have this roaring economy, we have the companies that are changing the world are part of our backyard, we have a championship-caliber team, and we have a great city, great global city that never in its history has had one of these [arenas]. 
 ""So, I wouldn't recommend anybody else trying to recreate that formula because I think it'd be impossible.""

Gaia Vince,"On the evening of February, 17, Professor Mary Beard posted on Twitter a photograph of herself crying. The eminent University of Cambridge classicist, who has almost 200,000 Twitter followers, was distraught after receiving a storm of abuse online. This was the reaction to a comment she had made about Haiti. She also tweeted: “I speak from the heart (and of course I may be wrong). But the crap I get in response just isn’t on; really it isn’t.” In the days that followed, Beard received support from several high-profile people. Greg Jenner, a fellow celebrity historian, tweeted about his own experience of a Twitterstorm: “I’ll always remember how traumatic it was to suddenly be hated by strangers. Regardless of morality–I may have been wrong or right in my opinion–I was amazed (later, when I recovered) at how psychologically destabilising it was to me.” Those tweeting support for Beard–irrespective of whether they agreed with her initial tweet that had triggered the abusive responses–were themselves then targeted. And when one of Beard’s critics, fellow Cambridge academic Priyamvada Gopal, a woman of Asian heritage, set out her response to Beard’s original tweet in an online article, she received her own torrent of abuse. [Photos: Annie Spratt / Unsplash, Andrey Grinkevich / Unsplash ] There is overwhelming evidence that women and members of ethnic minority groups are disproportionately the target of Twitter abuse. Where these identity markers intersect, the bullying can become particularly intense, as experienced by black female MP Diane Abbott, who alone received nearly half of all the abusive tweets sent to female MPs during the run-up to the 2017 U.K. general election. Black and Asian female MPs received on average 35% more abusive tweets than their white female colleagues even when Abbott was excluded from the total. The constant barrage of abuse, including death threats and threats of sexual violence, is silencing people, pushing them off online platforms, and further reducing the diversity of online voices and opinion. And it shows no sign of abating. A survey last year found that 40% of American adults had personally experienced online abuse, with almost half of them receiving severe forms of harassment, including physical threats and stalking. Seventy percent of women described online harassment as a “major problem.” The business models of social media platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook, promote content that is more likely to get a response from other users because more engagement means better opportunities for advertising. But this has a consequence of favoring divisive and strongly emotive or extreme content, which can in turn nurture online “bubbles” of groups who reflect and reinforce each other’s opinions, helping propel the spread of more extreme content and providing a niche for “fake news.” In recent months, researchers have revealed many ways that various vested interests, including Russian operatives, have sought to manipulate public opinion by infiltrating social media bubbles. Our human ability to communicate ideas across networks of people enabled us to build the modern world. The internet offers unparalleled promise of cooperation and communication between all of humanity. But instead of embracing a massive extension of our social circles online, we seem to be reverting to tribalism and conflict, and belief in the potential of the internet to bring humanity together in a glorious collaborating network now begins to seem naive. While we generally conduct our real-life interactions with strangers politely and respectfully, online we can be horrible. How can we relearn the collaborative techniques that enabled us to find common ground and thrive as a species? [Photos: Annie Spratt / Unsplash, Andrey Grinkevich / Unsplash ] *** “Don’t overthink it, just press the button!” I click an amount, impoverishing myself in an instant, and quickly move on to the next question, aware that we’re all playing against the clock. My teammates are far away and unknown to me. I have no idea if we’re all in it together or whether I’m being played for a fool, but I press on, knowing that the others are depending on me. I’m playing in a so-called public goods game at Yale University’s Human Cooperation Lab. The researchers here use it as a tool to help understand how and why we cooperate, and whether we can enhance our prosocial behavior. Over the years, scientists have proposed various theories about why humans cooperate so well that we form strong societies. The evolutionary roots of our general niceness, most researchers now believe, can be found in the individual survival advantage humans experience when we cooperate as a group. I’ve come to New Haven, Connecticut, in a snowy February, to visit a cluster of labs where researchers are using experiments to explore further our extraordinary impulse to be nice to others even at our own expense. The game I’m playing, on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk online platform, is one of the lab’s ongoing experiments. I’m in a team of four people in different locations, and each of us is given the same amount of money to play with. We are asked to choose how much money we will contribute to a group pot, on the understanding that this pot will then be doubled and split equally among us. [Photos: Annie Spratt / Unsplash, Andrey Grinkevich / Unsplash ] This sort of social dilemma, like all cooperation, relies on a certain level of trust that the others in your group will be nice. If everybody in the group contributes all of their money, all the money gets doubled, redistributed four ways, and everyone doubles their money. Win–win! “But if you think about it from the perspective of an individual,” says lab director David Rand, “for each dollar that you contribute, it gets doubled to two dollars and then split four ways–which means each person only gets 50 cents back for the dollar they contributed.” Even though everyone is better off collectively by contributing to a group project that no one could manage alone–in real life, this could be paying toward a hospital building, or digging a community irrigation ditch–there is a cost at the individual level. Financially, you make more money by being more selfish. Rand’s team has run this game with thousands of players. Half of them are asked, as I was, to decide their contribution rapidly–within 10 seconds–whereas the other half are asked to take their time and carefully consider their decision. It turns out that when people go with their gut, they are much more generous than when they spend time deliberating. “There is a lot of evidence that cooperation is a central feature of human evolution,” says Rand. Individuals benefit, and are more likely to survive, by cooperating with the group. And being allowed to stay in the group and benefit from it is reliant on our reputation for behaving cooperatively. [Photos: Annie Spratt / Unsplash, Andrey Grinkevich / Unsplash ] “In the small-scale societies that our ancestors were living in, all our interactions were with people that you were going to see again and interact with in the immediate future,” Rand says. That kept in check any temptation to act aggressively or take advantage and free ride off other people’s contributions. “It makes sense, in a self-interested way, to be cooperative.” Cooperation breeds more cooperation in a mutually beneficial cycle. Rather than work out every time whether it’s in our long-term interests to be nice, it’s more efficient and less effort to have the basic rule: Be nice to other people. That’s why our unthinking response in the experiment is a generous one. Throughout our lives, we learn from the society around us how cooperative to be. But our learned behaviors can also change quickly. Those in Rand’s experiment who play the quickfire round are mostly generous and receive generous dividends, reinforcing their generous outlook. Whereas those who consider their decisions are more selfish, resulting in a meager group pot, reinforcing an idea that it doesn’t pay to rely on the group. So, in a further experiment, Rand gave some money to people who had played a round of the game. They were then asked how much they wanted to give to an anonymous stranger. This time, there was no incentive to give; they would be acting entirely charitably. It turned out there were big differences. The people who had got used to cooperating in the first stage gave twice as much money in the second stage as the people who had got used to being selfish did. “So we’re affecting people’s internal lives and behavior,” Rand says. “The way they behave even when no one’s watching and when there’s no institution in place to punish or reward them.” Rand’s team have tested how people in different countries play the game, to see how the strength of social institutions–such as government, family, education and legal systems–influences behavior. In Kenya, where public sector corruption is high, players initially gave less generously to the stranger than players in the U.S., which has less corruption. This suggests that people who can rely on relatively fair social institutions behave in a more public-spirited way; those whose institutions are less reliable are more protectionist. However, after playing just one round of the cooperation-promoting version of the public goods game, the Kenyans’ generosity equalled the Americans.’ And it cut both ways: Americans who were trained to be selfish gave a lot less. So is there something about online social media culture that makes some people behave meanly? Unlike ancient hunter-gatherer societies, which rely on cooperation and sharing to survive and often have rules for when to offer food to whom across their social network, social media have weak institutions. They offer physical distance, relative anonymity and little reputational or punitive risk for bad behavior: if you’re mean, no one you know is going to see. [Photos: Annie Spratt / Unsplash, Andrey Grinkevich / Unsplash ] *** I trudge a couple of blocks through driving snow to find Molly Crockett’s Psychology Lab, where researchers are investigating moral decision-making in society. One area they focus on is how social emotions are transformed online, in particular moral outrage. Brain-imaging studies show that when people act on their moral outrage, their brain’s reward center is activated–they feel good about it. This reinforces their behavior, so they are more likely to intervene in a similar way again. So, if they see somebody acting in a way that violates a social norm, by allowing their dog to foul a playground, for instance, and they publicly confront the perpetrator about it, they feel good afterward. And while challenging a violator of your community’s social norms has its risks–you may get attacked–it also boosts your reputation. In our relatively peaceful lives, we are rarely faced with outrageous behavior, so we rarely see moral outrage expressed. Open up Twitter or Facebook and you get a very different picture. Recent research shows that messages with both moral and emotional words are more likely to spread on social media–each moral or emotional word in a tweet increases the likelihood of it being retweeted by 20%. “Content that triggers outrage and that expresses outrage is much more likely to be shared,” Crockett says. What we’ve created online is “an ecosystem that selects for the most outrageous content, paired with a platform where it’s easier than ever before to express outrage.” Unlike in the offline world, there is no personal risk in confronting and exposing someone. It only takes a few clicks of a button, and you don’t have to be physically nearby, so there is a lot more outrage expressed online. And it feeds itself. “If you punish somebody for violating a norm, that makes you seem more trustworthy to others, so you can broadcast your moral character by expressing outrage and punishing social norm violations,” Crockett says. “And people believe that they are spreading good by expressing outrage–that it comes from a place of morality and righteousness. “When you go from offline–where you might boost your reputation for whoever happens to be standing around at the moment–to online, where you broadcast it to your entire social network, then that dramatically amplifies the personal rewards of expressing outrage.” This is compounded by the feedback people get on social media, in the form of likes and retweets and so on. “Our hypothesis is that the design of these platforms could make expressing outrage into a habit, and a habit is something that’s done without regard to its consequences–it’s insensitive to what happens next, it’s just a blind response to a stimulus,” Crockett explains. “I think it’s worth having a conversation as a society as to whether we want our morality to be under the control of algorithms whose purpose is to make money for giant tech companies,” she adds. “I think we would all like to believe and feel that our moral emotions, thoughts and behaviors are intentional and not knee-jerk reactions to whatever is placed in front of us that our smartphone designer thinks will bring them the most profit.” On the upside, the lower costs of expressing outrage online have allowed marginalized, less-empowered groups to promote causes that have traditionally been harder to advance. Moral outrage on social media played an important role in focusing attention on the sexual abuse of women by high-status men. And in February 2018, Florida teens railing on social media against yet another high-school shooting in their state helped to shift public opinion, as well as shaming a number of big corporations into dropping their discount schemes for National Rifle Association members. “I think that there must be ways to maintain the benefits of the online world,” says Crockett, “while thinking more carefully about redesigning these interactions to do away with some of the more costly bits.” Someone who’s thought a great deal about the design of our interactions in social networks is Nicholas Christakis, director of Yale’s Human Nature Lab, located just a few more snowy blocks away. His team studies how our position in a social network influences our behavior, and even how certain influential individuals can dramatically alter the culture of a whole network. The team is exploring ways to identify these individuals and enlist them in public health programs that could benefit the community. In Honduras, they are using this approach to influence vaccination enrollment and maternal care, for example. Online, such people have the potential to turn a bullying culture into a supportive one. Corporations already use a crude system of identifying so-called Instagram influencers to advertise their brands for them. But Christakis is looking not just at how popular an individual is, but also their position in the network and the shape of that network. In some networks, like a small isolated village, everyone is closely connected, and you’re likely to know everyone at a party; in a city, by contrast, people may be living more closely by as a whole, but you are less likely to know everyone at a party there. How thoroughly interconnected a network is affects how behaviors and information spread around it, he explains. “If you take carbon atoms and you assemble them one way, they become graphite, which is soft and dark. Take the same carbon atoms and assemble them a different way, and it becomes diamond, which is hard and clear. These properties of hardness and clearness aren’t properties of the carbon atoms–they’re properties of the collection of carbon atoms and depend on how you connect the carbon atoms to each other,” he says. “And it’s the same with human groups.” Christakis has designed software to explore this by creating temporary artificial societies online. “We drop people in and then we let them interact with each other and see how they play a public goods game, for example, to assess how kind they are to other people.” Then he manipulates the network. “By engineering their interactions one way, I can make them really sweet to each other, work well together, and they are healthy and happy and they cooperate. Or you take the same people and connect them a different way and they’re mean jerks to each other and they don’t cooperate and they don’t share information and they are not kind to each other.” In one experiment, he randomly assigned strangers to play the public goods game with each other. In the beginning, he says, about two-thirds of people were cooperative. “But some of the people they interact with will take advantage of them and, because their only option is either to be kind and cooperative or to be a defector, they choose to defect because they’re stuck with these people taking advantage of them. And by the end of the experiment everyone is a jerk to everyone else.” Christakis turned this around simply by giving each person a little bit of control over who they were connected to after each round. “They had to make two decisions: am I kind to my neighbors or am I not; and do I stick with this neighbor or do I not.” The only thing each player knew about their neighbors was whether each had cooperated or defected in the round before. “What we were able to show is that people cut ties to defectors and form ties to cooperators, and the network rewired itself and converted itself into a diamond-like structure instead of a graphite-like structure.” In other words, a cooperative prosocial structure instead of an uncooperative structure. [Photos: Annie Spratt / Unsplash, Andrey Grinkevich / Unsplash ] In an attempt to generate more cooperative online communities, Christakis’s team have started adding bots to their temporary societies. He takes me over to a laptop and sets me up on a different game. In this game, anonymous players have to work together as a team to solve a dilemma that tilers will be familiar with: each of us has to pick from one of three colors, but the colors of players directly connected to each other must be different. If we solve the puzzle within a time limit, we all get a share of the prize money; if we fail, no one gets anything. I’m playing with at least 30 other people. None of us can see the whole network of connections, only the people we are directly connected to–nevertheless, we have to cooperate to win. I’m connected to two neighbors, whose colors are green and blue, so I pick red. My left neighbor then changes to red so I quickly change to blue. The game continues and I become increasingly tense, cursing my slow reaction times. I frequently have to switch my color, responding to unseen changes elsewhere in the network, which send a cascade of changes along the connections. Time’s up before we solve the puzzle, prompting irate responses in the game’s comments box from remote players condemning everyone else’s stupidity. Personally, I’m relieved it’s over and there’s no longer anyone depending on my cack-handed gaming skills to earn money. Christakis tells me that some of the networks are so complex that the puzzle is impossible to solve in the timeframe. My relief is short-lived, however: the one I played was solvable. He rewinds the game, revealing for the first time the whole network to me. I see now that I was on a lower branch off the main hub of the network. Some of the players were connected to just one other person, but most were connected to three or more. Thousands of people from around the world play these games on Amazon Mechanical Turk, drawn by the small fee they earn per round. But as I’m watching the game I just played unfold, Christakis reveals that three of these players are actually planted bots. “We call them ‘dumb AI’,” he says. His team is not interested in inventing super-smart AI to replace human cognition. Instead, the plan is to infiltrate a population of smart humans with dumb-bots to help the humans help themselves. “We wanted to see if we could use the dumb-bots to get the people unstuck so they can cooperate and coordinate a little bit more – so that their native capacity to perform well can be revealed by a little assistance,” Christakis says. He found that if the bots played perfectly, that didn’t help the humans. But if the bots made some mistakes, they unlocked the potential of the group to find a solution. “Some of these bots made counter-intuitive choices. Even though their neighbors all had green and they should have picked orange, instead they also picked green.” When they did that, it allowed one of the green neighbors to pick orange, “which unlocks the next guy over, he can pick a different color and, wow, now we solve the problem”. Without the bot, those human players would probably all have stuck with green, not realizing that was the problem. “Increasing the conflicts temporarily allows their neighbors to make better choices.” By adding a little noise into the system, the bots helped the network to function more efficiently. Perhaps a version of this model could involve infiltrating the newsfeeds of partisan people with occasional items offering a different perspective, helping to shift people out of their social media comfort-bubbles and allow society as a whole to cooperate more. Much antisocial behavior online stems from the anonymity of internet interactions – the reputational costs of being mean are much lower than offline. Here, bots may also offer a solution. One experiment found that the level of racist abuse tweeted at black users could be dramatically slashed by using bot accounts with white profile images to respond to racist tweeters. A typical bot response to a racist tweet would be: “Hey man, just remember that there are real people who are hurt when you harass them with that kind of language.” Simply cultivating a little empathy in such tweeters reduced their racist tweets almost to zero for weeks afterwards. Another way of addressing the low reputational cost for bad behavior online is to engineer in some form of social punishment. One game company, League of Legends, did that by introducing a “Tribunal” feature, in which negative play is punished by other players. The company reported that 280,000 players were “reformed” in one year, meaning that after being punished by the Tribunal they had changed their behavior and then achieved a positive standing in the community. Developers could also build in social rewards for good behavior, encouraging more cooperative elements that help build relationships. Researchers are already starting to learn how to predict when an exchange is about to turn bad–the moment at which it could benefit from pre-emptive intervention. “You might think that there is a minority of sociopaths online, which we call trolls, who are doing all this harm,” says Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, at Cornell University’s Department of Information Science. “What we actually find in our work is that ordinary people, just like you and me, can engage in such antisocial behavior. For a specific period of time, you can actually become a troll. And that’s surprising.” It’s also alarming. I mentally flick back through my own recent tweets, hoping I haven’t veered into bullying in some awkward attempt to appear funny or cool to my online followers. After all, it can be very tempting to be abusive to someone far away, who you don’t know, if you think it will impress your social group. Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil has been investigating the comments sections below online articles. He identifies two main triggers for trolling: the context of the exchange–how other users are behaving–and your mood. “If you’re having a bad day, or if it happens to be Monday, for example, you’re much more likely to troll in the same situation,” he says. “You’re nicer on a Saturday morning.” After collecting data, including from people who had engaged in trolling behavior in the past, Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil built an algorithm that predicts with 80% accuracy when someone is about to become abusive online. This provides an opportunity to, for example, introduce a delay in how fast they can post their response. If people have to think twice before they write something, that improves the context of the exchange for everyone: you’re less likely to witness people misbehaving, and so less likely to misbehave yourself. The good news is that, in spite of the horrible behavior many of us have experienced online, the majority of interactions are nice and cooperative. Justified moral outrage is usefully employed in challenging hateful tweets. A recent British study looking at anti-Semitism on Twitter found that posts challenging anti-Semitic tweets are shared far more widely than the anti-Semitic tweets themselves. Most hateful posts were ignored or only shared within a small echo chamber of similar accounts. Perhaps we’re already starting to do the work of the bots ourselves. As Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil points out, we’ve had thousands of years to hone our person-to-person interactions, but only 20 years of social media. “Offline, we have all these cues from facial expressions to body language to pitch… whereas online we discuss things only through text. I think we shouldn’t be surprised that we’re having so much difficulty in finding the right way to discuss and cooperate online.” As our online behavior develops, we may well introduce subtle signals, digital equivalents of facial cues, to help smooth online discussions. In the meantime, the advice for dealing with online abuse is to stay calm, it’s not your fault. Don’t retaliate but block and ignore bullies, or if you feel up to it, tell them to stop. Talk to family or friends about what’s happening and ask them to help you. Take screenshots and report online harassment to the social media service where it’s happening, and if it includes physical threats, report it to the police. If social media as we know it is going to survive, the companies running these platforms are going to have to keep steering their algorithms, perhaps informed by behavioral science, to encourage cooperation rather than division, positive online experiences rather than abuse. As users, we too may well learn to adapt to this new communication environment so that civil and productive interaction remains the norm online as it is offline. “I’m optimistic,” Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil says. “This is just a different game and we have to evolve.” This article was adapted from Mosaic Science.

Laura Fagan,"It's a well-known fact that amongst Kingdom Hearts fans that the series is notoriously complex. It rivals games like Metal Gear Solid in its narrative and parody mocking how complicated it is. Kingdom Hearts lore has been subject to extensive wikis being written on the topics, and fans for years (including myself!) trying to piece all the jigsaw pieces Tetsuya Nomura created into something sane. There is plenty of this franchise that remains a mystery, which has kept people talking about it during the 12 year gulf between Kingdom Hearts 2 and the soon to be released Kingdom Hearts 3.
You don't need a crash course in Kingdom Hearts lore to understand what is going to happen in this new game, but a lot of smaller elements of the game will make a lot more sense if you have some idea of what happened up to this point. But it's not as simple as ""just play the first and second game"" this time. Kingdom Hearts spans multiple platforms, multiple console generations within those platforms, and a long-running mobile game that has itself been entirely rebranded along the way. It suffers from complications in telling a cohesive story, first of which is that the games were not released in chronological order. In this article, I will be explaining the lore of Kingdom Hearts in the games chronological order as it is the easiest way for newcomers to understand the plot.
It's important to keep in mind that this guide is not going to be an effort to explain every single thing that happens in all of the games, but more the abridged version containing key elements and themes throughout.
The final chapter?
The culmination of more than a decade of waiting impatiently.
Sora, Riku, Kairi, and half a dozen others are back and ready to travel through all of the threads connecting Kingdom Hearts to defeat the Heartless and their masters.
Before we do anything else, here's a visual guide for how all of the Kingdom Hearts games fit in the overall timeline leading up to Kingdom Hearts 3.
Kingdom Hearts Unchained Chi (key) / Kingdom Hearts Union Cross
Kingdom Hearts Union Cross tells us the story of the Master of Masters, the Fortellers, and the first Keyblade War. It starts with the Master of Masters telling his apprentices known as the Fortellers that the end of their world is coming soon. He wrote a Book of Prophecy and gave them all unique roles. The Master is tremendously powerful, as all people in Daybreak Town can use keyblades in order to gain lux but he has also created beings called Chirithy who protect players against Nightmares and guide them throughout their journeys.
There are three things of note in this; the Master of Masters reveals to his apprentices that there is a traitor in their mix that ends up causing the end of the world. One of the Foretellers is tasked with creating a group called the Dandelions, and finally that there is the last apprentice called Luxu who is tasked with taking the Masters Keyblade No Name and passing it down to Luxu's next apprentice along with a Box that he is tasked to never opening or revealing its contents. However, being heavily quizzed by Luxu the Master whispers the contents to Luxu and all we know is that Luxu looks shocked and perplexed.
The rest of the game goes about as the Master intended. The worlds get consumed by darkness due to the first keyblade war, and the Dandelions succeed in escaping to a new world where they can start again. This is in a digital world in order to forget the trauma of the first keyblade war.
The player awakes in a digital version Enchanted Dominion where Maleficent is present. She is actively trying to undo the actions of her first defeat here (see Sleeping Beauty, and it is heavily implied that she has acquired a Book of Prophecy. However, she is informed by an unknown figure in black that she is unable to undo her first defeat as she is in a Data Simulation. We are told this is due to the lack of power that the Book of Prophecy has due to the lack of a Master or Foretellers. In order to stop her doing more damage in this timeline, the mysterious figure teaches her how to move forward through time.
This game is an ongoing mobile game, and at the time of writing these are the key points that Union Cross has to offer.
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep
$30 at Amazon
We move forward significantly in time when we come to three Keyblade wielders: Aqua, Terra, and Ventus. Aqua &amp; Terra are in the process of completing their Mark of Mastery exam, which is overseen by their Master, Eraqus and joined by Master Xehanort. Aqua passes her Mark of Mastery and Terra does not due to Xehanort manipulating the darkness and Terra momentarily loses control to the darkness.
Aqua, now a keyblade master, is tasked with keeping an eye on Terra as well as dealing with the situation of the unversed who are terrorizing other worlds.
Terra after acknowledging that there is some darkness in him, does not accept this fact and goes to tackle the Unversed in an attempt to prove himself to Master Eraqus. Xehanort spends time talking to Terra about the darkness and that Master Eraqus fears the darkness so much that he would go to extreme lengths to make sure the darkness doesn't surface. Little does Terra realize that Xehanort is making him lean into the darkness so that he could eventually use Terra as a vessel.
Meanwhile, Ventus is taunted by a boy in a mask called Vanitas that Terra will outgrow him and leave him behind. Ventus, spurred by this, flees Land of Departure in search of Terra even though Master Eraqus forbid him from leaving.
The three friends continue to go around the worlds dealing with the Unversed but some shocking developments transpire. Aqua meets a young girl called Kairi on her adventures and accidentally performs a bequeathing ceremony when Kairi grabs Aqua's keyblade in fear. Terra, when visiting a world called Destiny Islands, meets a boy called Riku and performs the bequeathing ceremony on him so that when the time comes he'll have the strength to protect his friends. Ventus learns that he is a part of something known as the X blade a keyblade that has the ability to unlock Kingdom Hearts. It's when he is united with Vanitas that the X blade can be forged.
In desperation, an inconsolable Master Eraqus attempts to kill Ventus in order for the X blade to never be forged. Terra sees the attempt on Ventus life and is so enraged by their Masters actions that he unleashes the darkness and kills Master Eraqus. In his last moments, Master Eraqus laments how blind he has been to Xehanort's plans to turn Terra against him and how he failed to see that everywhere there was unversed there was also Xehanort.
Xehanort, after seeing what Terra has done, taunts him into coming to the Keyblade Graveyard where the first keyblade war took place, and Terra goes and meets with Aqua &amp; Ventus. Aqua has been to other worlds seeing what the unversed has done, and attributes the damage to Terra. Upon hearing the word that Terra had killed their master and had headed towards the Keyblade Graveyard, she goes to join him to hear it first hand herself. Ventus after being told by Master Eraqus that he is apart of the X blade journeys to the keyblade graveyard to confront Vanitas and to put an end to Xehanort's schemes.
The three friends reunite together briefly to confirm what they've all realized, which is they were all being manipulated into continuing this plan of Xehanort's to forge the X blade and open Kingdom Hearts. The three of them fight against Xehanort and Vanitas; Terra fighting against Xehanort and Aqua &amp; Ventus fighting against Vanitas.
Terra loses to Xehanort, and ends up becoming Terra-Xehanort. However, Xehanort doesn't completely succeed, as Terra causes Terra-Xehanort to lose his memory of what has transpired. Terra-Xehanort lands in Radiant Garden, where a man called Ansem the Wise, finds him and becomes his apprentice in a research lab learning about the heart.
It is said that when Terra returns to the Realm of Light he goes on to repossess his own armor and takes the name of Lingering Will.
Ventus and Vanitas manage to forge the X blade, only to be defeated by Aqua &amp; King Mickey (who is Yen Sid's apprentice, and came sensing something was amiss) but the shattering of the X blade caused Ventus' heart to shatter also. This leaves Ventus in a comatose state, and there is no sign of Terra or Xehanort. Aqua awakes in Yen Sid's tower after King Mickey saves Aqua &amp; Ventus from the battlefield and brings them to Yen Sid.
Aqua then travels from Yen Sid's Tower to the Land of Departure where she places Ventus on an empty throne. Using Master Eraqus Keyblade, she locks the world of Land of Departure and it turns into Castle Oblivion. She manages to track down Terra-Xehanort to Radiant Garden and confronts him about everything that's transpired.
Aqua is unable to bring Terra back to his senses and after defeating Xehanort who possesses him, Xehanort stabs himself with his own Keyblade in an attempt to lock Terra out of his body entirely, much to the horror of Aqua. As Terra falls through a portal to the Realm of Darkness and Aqua dives straight after him.
Realizing she is unable to save them both, she uses her armor that protects her from the darkness and uses it to bring Terra back to the Realm of Light. Even though it dooms Aqua to roam through the Realm of Darkness for many years to come. It is said that when Terra returns to the Realm of Light he goes on to repossess his own armor and takes the name of Lingering Will.
Kingdom Hearts 1
$26 on Amazon
Approximately 10 years later, we meet three friends in a world called Destiny Islands Sora, Riku, and Kairi. The three friends are preparing a raft to sail to other worlds, but while gathering materials Sora meets a mysterious figure telling him that the door will open soon and that he understands nothing. The night before they're due to leave, a tremendous storm hits Destiny Islands and the three friends brave the storm to rescue their raft.
Sora finds Riku on an isolated part of the beach where he nonsensically tells Sora that the door is open and that they have to go now if they want to go at all. Riku tells Sora he is not afraid of the dark, and the two friends are surrounded by darkness and the two friends attempted to grab each other's hands. They fail, and a sharp light surrounds Sora and in his hands, he holds a Keyblade. With this, he fights his way through the Island and finds a nearly unconscious Kairi that reaches out for him before she disappears and Sora is swept away by a great breeze to another world.
Sora awakes in Traverse Town, a world where people without a world gather. Riku wakes up in Hollow Bastion. Kairi's whereabouts remain unknown. Sora eventually meets with Donald and Goofy, King Mickey's Captain and head mage as they are tasked with finding a key. The three decide to work together to find Sora's missing friends and King Mickey, and travel around closing the hearts to all the worlds to stop the invading of the heartless that are swarming.
Maleficent resides in Hollow Bastion where she manipulates Riku into thinking that Sora has forgotten all about him and Kairi and cannot be trusted to protect either of them. This causes a rift between Sora and Riku for the rest of the game. As they both want to restore Kairi's heart back to her body when they separated after she disappeared from Sora at Destiny Islands.
Sora travels through all the worlds sealing the keyholes and learns that there is a plot to open the door to darkness by using the seven princesses of heart. His journey takes him to Hollow Bastion where he is confronted by Riku who takes the power of the Keyblade away from Sora due to the bequeathing ceremony that Terra gave Riku all those years ago.
Riku's last words to Sora is that he is to take care of Kairi.
Undeterred by this, Sora ventures into the Hollow Bastion to find his friends even though he has no means to defend himself. He is accompanied by Beast (from Beauty &amp; the Beast) as he is searching for Belle who turns out to be a princess of heart. The pair venture further and further until Sora is again challenged by Riku for continuing on unarmed and powerless.
Riku then attacks Sora only to protected by Goofy who refuses to betray Sora and Sora realizes that his true strength was never in the Keyblade but in the strength of his heart. With the Keyblade acknowledging this, it returns to Sora and with the help of Donald and Goofy they defeat Riku. He then flees further into the castle and Beast remarks that it was ultimately Sora's heart that won that battle.
Riku seeps further into the darkness and as Sora and the gang catch up with him and Maleficent. Riku stabs Maleficent releasing the darkness in her heart causing her to turn into a fearful dragon. Sora and his friends defeat Maleficent and pursue Riku to where Sora finds Kairi's lifeless body on the ground. A now twisted Riku, under the possession of darkness (Ansem the Seeker of Darkness), tells Sora that Kairi is also a Princess of Heart and that Kairi's heart is within Sora. After a struggle between the pair Sora emerges victorious, and in order to return Kairi's heart to her Sora uses the keyblade on himself in order to release Kairi's heart.
This action briefly turns Sora into a Heartless but he is saved by Kairi's power of being a princess of heart and this reverts Sora back to his normal self.
The group return back to Traverse Town, where Sora, Donald and Goofy decide they must pursue Ansem the Seeker of Darkness in order to rescue Riku and restore the world's order. The trio journey to the End of the World in order to confront Ansem the Seeker of Darkness and ultimately succeed in defeating him at the door to Kingdom Hearts. His defeat means that Riku was able to return to his normal form. With the help of King Mickey, Riku is able to close the door from the realm of darkness while Sora, Donald and Goofy are able to lock it from their side.
The closing of the doors means that all of the worlds will be restored to how they were before. Riku's last words to Sora is that he is to take care of Kairi, and in the restoration of the world Sora meets Kairi before she is sent back to Destiny Islands and Sora promises her that he will return to Destiny Islands.
The game ends with Sora, Donald, and Goofy in search of Riku and King Mickey.
Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep a Fragmentary Passage (Aqua Gameplay)
This isn't a standalone game, but additional content first seen in the Kingdom Hearts 2 re-release on PlayStation 4, called HD 2.8 Final Prologue.
$33 on Amazon
The easiest way to tell the story of 0.2 Birth by Sleep a Fragmentary Passage is to break it down into the bits that happen in the right chronological order. Which means all of Aqua's journey in Fragmentary Passage is first on the list.
We find an increasingly weary Aqua musing on how much time has passed as she has roamed the realm of Darkness. She finds distorted versions of worlds that she has been to previously and sets about trying to figure out how these bits of the worlds have managed to get into the realm of darkness. Her worry increases as she continues further on.
Aqua is having to grapple with her own darkness and regularly has to battle apparitions of herself in darkness. She also sees apparitions of Ventus and Terra whom she thinks are guiding her towards something. Terra's apparition, that is really Xehanort in Terra's guise, nearly tricks Aqua into revealing to him Ventus' hiding place in Castle Oblivion. The real Terra manages to fight Xehanort again for possession. As Aqua looks on she is caught off guard by a darksider (boss level heartless) and passes out. As Aqua floats deeper into the darkness she is rescued by King Mickey who explains that it's been some time since they last met at the keyblade graveyard.
The two journey forward to find Riku trying to close the Door to Darkness but unbeknownst to him is about to get swarmed by Darksiders. Aqua buys the pair time for King Mickey to grab a special keyblade that closes the door to darkness from their side and for Riku to help pull the door shut.
Aqua succeeds in this and as she drifts into the darkness once more she sees a droplet of light falling confirming that Kingdom Hearts was secured once more.
Kingdom Hearts 358/2 days
$22 at Amazon
It's important to keep in mind that 358/2 days starts from the end of Kingdom Hearts 1, through Chain of Memories and finishes at Kingdom Hearts 2.
A boy named Roxas awakens outside a large mansion in a world called Twilight Town. Unable to remember his name, he is gifted the name Roxas by a man in a black coat who calls himself Xemnas. With nothing else to do and in hopes of finding answers, he joins Xemnas and his group called Organization 13 and is given the number 13.
Roxas is trained by number 8 Axel and the two of them become fast friends, even taking time together to go to the clock tower and eat some sea salt ice cream. Roxas is then trained by other members of the organization to gain more experience with his keyblade so he can best serve the organization. Meanwhile, Axel is sent to Castle Oblivion to help with overthrowing Marluxia's plans to overthrow Organization 13 and ensnare Sora.
Meanwhile, another member joins the organization by the name of Xion, and Roxas is tasked with teaching her the ropes. While initially, their relationship is cold, Xion opens up to Roxas sharing that she too can use a Keyblade. Soon enough, the three friends become inseparable.
However, tragedy strikes the group of friends when Roxas suddenly becomes comatose after the events of Chain of Memories. When Roxas awakens the events causes Xion and Roxas to question the reasons why they are in Organization 13 and what their purpose is. Overwhelmed by the questions that she cannot find answers to, Xion becomes the first member to defect from Organization 13.
Roxas attempts to defect later on to find more answers for himself but Axel attempts to stop him, telling him that the Organization will hunt him down and destroy him. Roxas replies to this with ""Nobody would miss me."" Axel screams at him that this isn't true, he would.
It's a short time later when Roxas stumbles across Xion who has since discovered the truth about her origins. That she is apart of Sora and is a replica of Xenmas' creation. Xion understands that herself and Roxas cannot co-exist and that she needs to return to Sora in order for him to wake up from the sleep that Naminé puts him in in Chain of Memories.
Xion tricks Roxas into killing her, and tells him the truth about their origins. That they are Nobodies and that Roxas cannot allow Xemnas to complete Kingdom Hearts. This solidifies Roxas' resolve to find Sora and returns to The World that Never Was to ensure Xion's dying wishes are fulfilled. However, upon returning to Memory Skyscraper in The World that Never Was Roxas is ambushed by Neo-Shadows, and after defeating several of them understands that he is outmatched.
Thankfully, Riku watches from the top of the skyscraper and aids Roxas in defeating the Neo-Shadows. After they defeat them, the pair immediately turns on each other. It is only after Riku releases the darkness in his heart and takes the physical form of Ansem, Seeker of Darkness, that he can subdue Roxas and take him to see DiZ (whose true identity is revealed in Kingdom Hearts 2) who places Roxas in a digital world of Twilight Town.
This Roxas knows nothing of previous events or his connections to Organization 13 and wakes up the last week of his summer holidays, which is where Kingdom Hearts 2 begins.
Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories
This game was originally released on the GameBoy Advance in 2006, was re-released to the PlayStation 2 in 2008, and the cut scenes to this game are now available in the Kingdom Hearts Final Mix compilation.
The beginning of Chain of Memories starts at the very end of Kingdom Hearts 1 where Sora, Donald, and Goofy are searching for Riku, and King Mickey. Pluto has a note with the King's Seal on a letter and leads them towards a cross road which is very similar to the keyblade graveyard. There, a hooded figure in black tells that to continue he must be willing to lose what he has gained so far.
The trio continue on until they find a bizarre looking castle. Upon entry into the castle they are greeted again by a hooded figure who tells them that this castle is called Castle Oblivion. In Castle Oblivion to lose is to find, so if they are going to continue looking for their friends they must be willing to give up what they already know. In the pursuit of answers the trio venture forward.
On their journey the group start to forget key things. Sora forgets the existence of Kairi and meets a version of Riku now known as Riku-Replica who was created by Vexen, one of the other members of Organization 13. Riku-Replica and Sora fight over Naminé both becoming obsessed with her. So much so that Sora becomes antagonistic to his friends and anything else that threatens to come between himself and Naminé.
Sora's journey in Chain of Memories ends when he defeats Marluxia (a member of the Organization who is trying to overthrow Xemnas by taking Sora hostage). Naminé reveals to Sora that she has been manipulating his memories and that she can put them back together given time. Sora agrees to this, and is placed in a pod to restore his memories.
Following Sora's story we continue Chain of Memories with Riku who finds himself transported from the Realm of Darkness after Kingdom Hearts 1 to the basement of Castle Oblivion. He is tasked to do battle with Ansem, the Seeker of Darkness who is still trying to possess Riku's body, his own personal battles with the darkness, and three Organization 13 members. Vexen fights Riku where he manages to get a sample of his heart in order to create Riku-Replica. There are plenty of attempts of disposing of Riku at this stage. Ansem, seeker of Darkness regularly challenges Riku for his body only to be held back by the power of King Mickey.
DiZ grants Riku this opportunity and Riku ultimately defeats Ansem, Seeker of Darkness.
As they progress through the castle Riku defeats Lexaeus and he is dragged to the Realm of Darkness only to be saved by King Mickey. Zexion, another minion of the organization, attempts to defeat Riku by showering him in a brilliant light. Once again, Riku is miraculously saved by Naminé who is in the guise of Kairi helping him to control his darkness once more. This allows Riku to defeat Zexion, after this a figure calling himself DiZ appears to Riku who has seemingly been watching Riku's adventures in Castle Oblivion tells Riku to go find Naminé.
As Riku searches for Naminé, he is confronted by Riku-Replica as he is convinced that the only way he can have a purpose and a reason to exist is to eliminate Riku. Riku with his renewed strength in finding the balance between the darkness and light easily defeats Riku-Replica. Upon finding Naminé she informs him that Ansem, Seeker of Darkness lives inside of his heart still and she offers to use her powers to lock Ansem, Seeker of Darkness away for good. Riku declines, wanting to defeat him himself in order to completely master the rest of the darkness that lurks in his heart. DiZ grants Riku this opportunity and Riku ultimately defeats Ansem, Seeker of Darkness.
Riku and King Mickey leave together after Mickey says he would like to see where this road takes Riku. When DiZ questions him about what way he wants to walk towards the Light or the Darkness. Riku simply states that he walks his own road. The Road to Dawn.
Kingdom Hearts 2
$35 at Amazon
At the start of Kingdom Hearts 2 we join Roxas back in a Digital Version of Twilight Town where he is spending his last week of summer vacation with his friends Hayner, Pence, and Olette. Instead of sitting around eating sea salt ice cream all day, Olette reminds them they have an assignment to do before the end of summer vacation. In the meantime a lot of odd things start happening in Twilight Town in relation to Roxas. Every night Roxas dreams of an event that has happened in previous Kingdom Hearts games and they always centre around Sora. He also sees glimpses of a mysterious blonde girl who calls out to him, but who is always out of reach.
Photos start to go missing that have Roxas picture in them, as well as people's ability to say the word 'photo'. This is because Organization 13 are trying to track Roxas down and the nobodies that are hunting them, called Husks, cannot tell the difference between real Roxas and the ones that are photos.
In this time Roxas is able to use a Keyblade to get rid of the husks and return the photos. However, during the annual fighting competition that happens in town that Roxas and his friends take part in, Axel appears to freeze time and challenge Roxas. He has no recollection of Axel and fighting him does not cause Roxas to remember him. DiZ appears to Roxas and tells him not to believe what Axel is saying. Roxas becomes so distressed he shouts for his friends.
The last day of Roxas' summer holidays arrives, and once again Axel attempts to challenge Roxas to make him remember. DiZ freezes time and orders Roxas to come to a mansion where he will find answers. While fighting his way through Twilight Town, the city is overrun with Husks until Roxas appears at the mansion and uses the Keyblade to open the gate and ventures inside.
There is a new threat to the worlds in the form of Organization 13, but what their aims are at this stage is still unclear.
After making his way through the mansion, Roxas stumbles upon the white room where Naminé resides. She begins to tell him the truth about how Roxas is a Nobody, that he is Axel's best friend from Organization 13, and is the other half of Sora. Before she reveals too much DiZ, and someone in a black hooded coat, swoops in to take Naminé away but before she does, she promises that they will see each other again they may just not recognize each other immediately.
Roxas begins to get angry at this point and ventures further into the mansion where he gets to a computer that proves his existence has been a lie, and everything has been synthesized. He remembers everything that's gone before about Organization 13 and in his last confrontation with Axel he acknowledges him but has to defeat him in other to move forward.
At the very basement of the mansion, Roxas stumbles upon Sora's pod and as the pod opens Roxas laments about how his summer vacation is over, and with that, he joins with Sora.
Sora awakens to the voices of Donald, and Goofy and they recall what they'd completed in Kingdom Hearts 1, but strangely there is a note in Jiminy's Journal that simply says, ""thank Naminé"". The trio venture through Twilight Town and after briefly meeting Hayner, Pence, and Olette they get attacked by some Husks. Still tired from waking the trio are quickly overwhelmed, only to be saved by King Mickey. He simply hands them a pouch with money, and tells them there is a train waiting for them in the station and that it knows the way.
The train takes them to Yen Sid's tower where Sora is introduced to King Mickey's Master. Yen Sid tells them the state of the world that they are now returning too after being asleep. That Heartless still exist, but that Nobodies are now present. There is a new threat to the worlds in the form of Organization 13, but what their aims are at this stage is still unclear.
So the trio venture out to continue doing what they do best, helping out worlds in trouble along with their friends, and searching for Riku and King Mickey. This takes them to a great war that breaks out in Hollow Bastion where there is a massive Heartless and Nobody wave that threatens to destroy the world. The trio fight valiantly until they reach the end of a great ravine where Xemnas reveals his great plan. To force Sora to defeat Heartless in order for him to create a version of Kingdom Hearts, so that all Nobodies can regain hearts.
This puts Sora in a quandary where if he continues to use the Keyblade it will feed this fake Kingdom Hearts but if he doesn't use it, the world's will become overrun with darkness. Sora and co. have this moral crisis at an inconvenient time, as Maleficent comes to their aid sending them to the realm of darkness for them to escape unscathed.
Trapped in the Realm of Darkness Sora and co. wander aimlessly for a while until a person in a black coat appears and leaves a box for them. Sora and co open the box they see a photo of Roxas, Hayner, Pence and Olette and a stick of sea salt ice cream. This gives them light that enables them to escape the Realm of Darkness and returns them back to the gummi ship.
Meanwhile, Kairi has sent a message in a bottle out to the ocean to someone who's name she can't entirely remember. A few weeks later, while remembering Sora's name she gets approached by Axel about how he can take her to see Sora. Kairi, who is obviously hesitant about going with someone who appeared out of a dark portal, resists him. At that very moment Pluto appears out of a portal and barks at Axel putting some space between him and Kairi. Kairi rushes towards the portal and ends up in Twilight Town where she briefly meets Hayner, Pence, and Olette. Shortly afterwards Axel reappears and completes his kidnapping of Kairi. When Hayner, Pence and Olette try to fight Axel they are quickly outmatched. Axel successfully takes Kairi to Organization 13 stronghold which resides in the World that Never Was.
Our trio return to Twilight Town to look for Hayner, Pence, and Olette only for them to tell Sora and co. that Kairi had been kidnapped. However, they are convinced that there is an alternative twilight town that centers around this mansion. So they all explore the mansion along with King Mickey who is checking in to see why they're all at the mansion. It's at this stage that King Mickey reveals that he knows where Ansem the Wise has gone and that he has gone to the invade the enemy's territory.
Riku simply tells Sora that he didn't want to be found.
Our crew manages to find a portal that brings them to the World that Never Was and they proceed to storm the castle. King Mickey goes on ahead to find his friend Ansem the Wise, who is revealed to be DiZ and that he has a machine that encodes the data of worlds to destroy the fake Kingdom Hearts. Meanwhile, Sora, Donald and Goofy get ambushed by a load of heartless but get rescued by Kairi (who was able to escape with the help of Naminé) and a hooded figure in black.
When the battle ceases the hooded figure attempts to flee, but Kairi calls out to the figure and asks Riku to stay. Not understanding this, Kairi asks Sora to trust her and to join her hands with the hooded figure and to close his eyes. By Sora closing his eyes, he sees that the person in the hood is actually Riku. Sora falls to his knees and cries in relief at being reunited with his friend once more. Riku explains that he took the physical appearance of Ansem, Seeker of Darkness when he had to release his darkness when fighting Roxas and it never reverted. Riku simply tells Sora that he didn't want to be found.
Our heroes venture through the castle only to find King Mickey and Ansem the Wise being confronted by Xemnas who has challenged them about the use of the machine. The machine then self destructs sending blinding light throughout the world. The fake Kingdom Hearts is destroyed, leaking the hearts that were gathered for it, and attracting the attention of the Heartless and Nobodies. Riku manages to revert back to his normal self after being restored by the light and our heroes go to challenge Xemnas to finish this once and for all.
The world now completely overrun by Heartless and Nobodies and help arrived in its most unusual form by way of Maleficent. She is confident in her ability to wield the darkness and either control or destroy the Heartless and Nobodies that approach, giving our hero's time to escape to pursue a fleeing Xemnas.
Our heroes eventually meet up with Xemnas and after a brief altercation seemingly succeed in subduing him. A portal opens thanks to Naminé and Roxas and Naminé reunite once more, fulfilling their promise of meeting again. Everyone makes it through the portal bar Riku and Sora who are forced to face Xemnas one last time.
The pair successfully defeat Xemnas and afterwards the pair are left roaming the Realm of Darkness. After sitting at the edge of the sea, Riku notices a floating bottle with a message in it for Sora. It's a note from Kairi that opens a Door to Light that lets the boys finally return home, victorious, to Destiny Island. They are warmly greeted by King Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Kairi who welcomes them home.
Sometime later, after their adventures, Kairi rushes over to Sora and Riku as she has found a bottle with the King's Seal, this bottle details the adventure of the next game and summons them to Yen Sid's Tower in order for them to take their Mark of Mastery.
Kingdom Hearts RE: Coded
We'll be talking about the story of Kingdom Hearts RE:Coded that is in The Story So Far bundle rather than Kingdom Hearts Coded. (Kingdom Hearts Coded came out exclusively on Japanese Mobiles &amp; never came out in the rest of the world.) Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded is the most accessible version of this game and there are only minor changes to the plot.
A short time after King Mickey returns home to Disney Castle, Jiminy and co. go through his journals and notices there is a line that he does not remember writing ""The hurting will be mended when you return to end it."" King Mickey digitizes the journal with the events of Kingdom Hearts 1 in hope to figure out what's going on. He sends a digital versions of Sora now called Data-Sora and guides him through the datascape that he now finds himself in. Data-Sora sees large blocks in the worlds he finds himself in and King Mickey tells him these are bugs that he needs to destroy them in order to debug the journal.
While all this is going on, our heroes don't realize that they have been transported into a digital world by a digital version of Riku at this point called Data-Riku (as opposed to Riku-Replica from Chain of Memories). Our heroes find out that Maleficent and her lackeys are also in the datascape in her latest attempt to conquer any worlds she lays her hand on.
Just as Data-Sora and Data-Riku are making good progress debugging the journal. Maleficent manages to destroy Data-Sora's keyblade and kidnaps Data-Riku. Data-Sora manage to continue through with the help of Donald and Goofy until he is able to regain the ability to use a Keyblade.
With the assistance of King Mickey, Data-Sora meets Data-Naminé who reveals that the real Naminé was the one who left the messages in the journal as she found some memories tied to Sora's heart.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Data-Riku who gets infected by one of Maleficent's lackeys who is forced to fight Data-Sora. Data-Sora only really has two options at this stage, let the datascape get completely corrupted, or attempt to debug Data-Riku. Data-Sora chooses to debug Data-Riku in an attempt to save both him and the datascape.
This debugging however causes everything to reset but King Mickey and co. manage to get back to their world before the reset happens. This reset would cause Data-Sora and Data-Riku's memories to be erased. But in the process reveals the culprit of the corrupting data which is Sora's heartless. Data-Sora manages to defeat the heartless and the journals are finally debugged for good.
With the journals fully debugged, Data-Riku manages to find an extra bit of data, and with King Mickey's guidance, sends Data-Sora to investigate. This takes Data-Sora to Castle Oblivion where he is challenged by Data-Roxas who wants to make Data-Sora suffer the pain of forgetting his friends. Data-Sora ultimately defeats Data-Roxas, and unlocks the deepest part of the data.
With the assistance of King Mickey, Data-Sora meets Data-Naminé who reveals that the real Naminé was the one who left the messages in the journal as she found some memories tied to Sora's heart. These people are Naminé, Terra, Aqua, Ventus, Roxas, Axel, and Xion.
Before Data-Naminé disappears she explains that Sora is the one who needs to save these people, and afterwards when King Mickey goes to Yen Sid's tower Yen Sid explains that all of the pieces are now in place for Xehanort's revival and it is time for Sora, and Riku to take the Mark of Mastery in order to be prepared for the upcoming threat. It is this story that King Mickey relays in the message in a bottle that Sora, Riku and Kairi read at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2.

Sora and Riku arrive at Yen Sid's tower where he tasks the boys with the Mark of Mastery exam. This exam is to bestow the pair with the abilities necessary to save their missing friends and oppose Xehanort. For the exam they are to unlock seven keyholes in order to restore sleeping worlds back to the Realm of Light. Yen Sid advises Sora and Riku to make Dream Eaters which are benevolent spirits to help defeat the Nightmares that threatens the worlds.
Sora and Riku are separated for their exam and while they complete their exam they regularly meet a grey-haired youth who accompanies Xemnas and Ansem. When the boys complete their exam they're transported to The World that Never Was instead of back home to Yen Sid's tower. Ansem and co. reveal to Sora that he had fallen into their trap, and he youth puts Sora into a deep sleep where Sora is forced to defeat Xemnas in his own dreams. Even though Sora defeats Xemnas in his own dreams, Sora loses his heart to the darkness but is protected by Ventus' armour.
Meanwhile Ansem reveals to Riku that he has spent his test traveling through Sora's dreams as a Dream Eater. Riku defeats Ansem but the youth confronts him after. The grey-haired youth reveals himself to be a younger version of Xehanort who is recruiting thirteen vessels across different times to resurrect the real Xehanort.
A revived Xehanort reveals that he intends to use Sora as his thirteenth vessel. This is so there is thirteen seekers of darkness to fight against the seven seekers of light that is meant to fulfill the prophecy of creating the X Blade. Xehanort is foiled in this attempt by being rescued by Riku, King Mickey, and Lea who is the restored version of Axel. Xehanort and his other counterparts fade back to their original timelines, with Xehanort promising that this is just a minor setback and that the two sides will ultimately clash.
Riku appears with Kairi, as she is to be trained to be a keyblade master.
With everyone returning to Yen Sid's Tower, Riku dives once more into Sora's dreams to rescue a sleeping Sora from the corrupted armor of Ventus. Riku successfully saves Sora but somehow winds up back at Destiny Island instead of Yen Sid's Tower. It's there he meets a digital version of Ansem the Wise who tells Riku he left some data in Sora's heart and that it will help him in restoring his connections to the others.
With this Riku, can return to Yen Sid's Tower where Sora and co are celebrating the end of the exam. Yen Sid commends the two's bravery in taking the exam, but since Sora fell to the darkness only Riku can be considered a Master.
Sora congratulates Riku and leaves Yen Sid's tower to go to Traverse Town where he goes to thank all of the Dream Eaters who helped him on his journey so far!
King Mickey and Yen Sid sit and discuss the next steps in Xehanort's plan and how they must gather seven seekers of light for Xehanort to not go after the seven princesses to open Kingdom Hearts. Riku appears in with Kairi as she is to be trained to be a keyblade master.
Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep a Fragmentary Passage (Yen Sid Cutscenes)
When King Mickey finishes telling Aqua's story in the gameplay of 0.2 Birth by Sleep a Fragmentary Passage Riku lashes out at him for not telling him about Aqua and all the sacrifices she made to save him at the end of Kingdom Hearts 1. Riku berates King Mickey for leaving her there for so long for all of these years.
Yen Sid interrupts Riku's rant, explaining that there was never a safe way to get that far into the Realm of Darkness to save Aqua and even if there were a safe way to do so neither King Mickey or Riku would have had the power to save her. However, now that Riku and King Mickey are both Keyblade Masters they now have the power to go save her.
Kairi asks what she can do to assist the pair and Yen Sid tells her she has her own role to play, she will embark on training with Lea who is also going to be trained to use a Keyblade. The two leave to go and be trained by the three good fairies and a wizard named Merlin who will help speed up their training.
King Mickey invites Riku to assist him in rescuing Aqua and with the two being given protective garments by Yen Sid the pair venture to the Realm of Darkness.
Yen Sid then summon Sora, Donald, and Goofy to talk them through Sora's next steps to regain the power he's lost in the events of Dream Drop Distance. Yen Sid reminds the group that their heart is their guiding key, and the group is reminded of a hero who lost his power and that reminds them of their friend Hercules who is in Olympus.

"Caroline Siede on TV Club, shared by Caroline Siede to The A.V. Club","The tricky thing about reviewing a show like Supergirl in its third season is that it can be hard to come up with new things to say about episodes that are fun but lacking in depth. To be completely honest, some weeks it feels like there’s not much to do beyond recap plot details and comment on the performances. Thankfully, “Shelter From The Storm” is not such an episode. I came away from this one absolutely brimming with stuff to talk about. Though it suffers from some of the mid-season reworking issues that plagued the previous episode, for the most part “Shelter From The Storm” weaves together a whole bunch of this season’s ongoing storylines in a purposeful, engaging way. And it introduces some fascinating wrinkles to its character dynamics too. “Shelter From The Storm” The most intriguing part of this episode is the Kara/Lena dynamic. Though Kara’s harsh anti-Kryptonite stance still feels like it’s come out of nowhere (remember when she and Alex used low levels of Kryptonite to help them train?), the episode at least has Lena directly call out Supergirl’s god complex. After all, humans are constantly surrounded by things that can kill them yet still manage to carry on their daily lives. Why does Supergirl get to be so self-righteous about her one and only weakness? Especially when that weakness could be invaluable to stopping Reign. “Shelter From The Storm” might as well be titled “Lena Was Right About Everything.” She was right to create Kryptonite to take down Reign. She was right that telling Alex about Ruby’s location would only put Ruby in harm’s way. And she was right to spend so much time studying Sam in a secret lab—after all, that’s where the DEO takes Reign after they manage to subdue her. Even better, Lena gets to prove her faultlessness directly (although unknowingly) to Supergirl’s face in that great elevator scene. One of my biggest frustrations with the CW era of Supergirl is how much it’s downplayed the idea of Kara leading a double life, which has always been one of my favorite aspects of the Supes mythos. If you’re willing to suspend your disbelief about Lena’s inability to tell that Supergirl and Kara are the same person, that elevator scene demonstrates the storytelling potential of the secret identity concept. Kara spends the episode arrogantly assuming that the trust issues in the Supergirl/Lena dynamic are a one-way street. Kara is so concerned about whether she can trust Lena, she doesn’t ever stop to think about whether Lena feels she can trust her. In the elevator scene, Lena gets to openly acknowledge how manipulative it was for Supergirl to send James to spy on her. And Kara can’t argue back because she’s literally in the middle of perpetuating a huge lie towards her supposed best friend. In other words, Kara fucked up and she knows it, which is a far more interesting idea than her single-minded hatred of Kryptonite. Less engaging is the way the episode clumsy maneuvers itself so that Mon-El can return to Earth even as Brainy and Imra journey “back to the future.” It’s equal parts predictable and inelegant, with Imra channeling Bill Pullman in Sleepless In Seattle as she magnanimously encourages her partner to follow his heart. At this point, I’d prefer it if Supergirl just had Kara and Mon-El immediately get back together rather than stretching out their painfully inevitable romantic reunion any longer. The main thrust of the episode, however, is about Reign, and “Shelter From The Storm” starts to provide payoff for how much time the first half of the season took to establish Sam and her backstory. Betty Buckley returns as Sam’s estranged mother Patricia and provides the episode with a much-needed emotional human element. From the beginning, Supergirl has loved a complicated mother/daughter dynamic and this episode takes full advantage of that. Realizing just how badly she failed as a mother, Patricia makes one final attempt to appeal to her possessed daughter—not for Patricia’s sake but for Ruby’s. Yet she still winds up dead for her efforts. It’s a dark moment and one that allows Melissa Benoist to put her empathetic crying skills to good use. Across the board, it’s in its willingness to go dark that “Shelter From The Storm” succeeds. Ruby survives Reign’s attack, but Patrica is killed; Kara and Lena’s tension is left unresolved; and M’yrnn’s heartbreaking memory issues remain even after he helps Supergirl figure out a way to appeal to Reign’s sense of justice. “Shelter From The Storm” resists the urge to tie everything up in a neat bow or even to give any real indication of where the season goes from here. With Reign at least temporarily captured, it’s anyone’s guess as to how the final five episodes of the season will play out. Stray observations I’d love to read an oral history about the way this season changed during production. The idea that Brainy, Imra, and Mon-El didn’t wake up the other Legionnaires because they were infected with the Blight really feels like a retcon. Equally inelegant is Brainy’s quick explanation that there’s absolutely no way that Reign evolves into Blight even though she absorbed Pestilence’s powers. There are a lot of really cool action concepts in “Shelter From The Storm,” especially in the final fight in Lex’s booby trapped mansion. It’s just a shame that the episode doesn’t quite have the CGI budget to pull them off. I love that Brainy’s seemingly kind gesture of giving Winn a jar of 31st century dirt was actually just a way to bug the DEO. Kara and J’onn get a couple lovely scenes together in this episode. More of that please! God bless Melissa Benoist’s ability to keep a straight face while delivering the line, “You have gall!” The episode ends with a mysterious scene of a young woman stealing a book that belongs to Thomas Coville’s Cult of Rao.","The tricky thing about reviewing a show like Supergirl in its third season is that it can be hard to come up with new things to say about  episodes that are fun but lacking in depth.

Mark Kaufman,"In the early hours of December 16, 2017, hot embers began raining down on the Southern California town of Montecito. Ominous, orange flames soon appeared on hills above the wooded community as the infamous Thomas Fire, burning for nearly two weeks at that point, lunged over the ridge and pushed into the enclave below. The odds weighed in the fire's favor: The winds picked up overnight, blowing 65 mph gusts in the direction of hundreds and hundreds of homes. But when the smoke and ash finally settled, the fire had lost for the most part, anyhow. ""They thought for sure that they were going to lose 400 or 500 homes instead they only lost seven,"" Crystal Kolden, a fire scientist at the University of Idaho and former wildland firefighter, said in an interview. ""It was a tremendous success story."" Fire danger in Montecito, Calif., on Nov. 20, 2018. Image: Mark Kaufman While there's no such thing as a fire-proof town in notorious fire country, Montecito is perhaps as close as it gets. Now, as fire experts and emergency crews still grapple with the horrors of the Camp Fire, by far the deadliest and most destructive in California history, Montecito's defensive efforts show that today's megafires exacerbated by climate change can be resisted. It won't ever be pretty, nor perfect, but homes can be defended, and at worst, people can have time to flee. ""Its the difference between living in a matchbox and a place thats more resistant,"" Kolden said. Becoming fire resistant Montecito's defensive fire efforts, developed over nearly two decades, haven't required technological breakthroughs nor big infusions of cash. Since 1999, Montecito has spent a little over $1.6 million on becoming fire resistant. ""That's so small,"" said Kolden. The defensive campaign adopted an almost battle-like strategy. Montecito set out to defend the higher road system that cuts across the top of town, largely separating the sprawling Los Padres National Forest from Montecito. The intent was simple: Thin about 70 percent of vegetation along the high road system, and effectively create a line of resistance. Montecito's location, about a 2 hour drive north of Los Angeles. Image: google Not all the vegetation can be removed, of course. That would doom the unstable land during rains, enabling deadly landslides, and debris flows. ""If you go back 20 years, people wanted to run bulldozers behind the whole community,"" said Kerry Kellogg, a Montecito city wildland fire specialist. ""But that wasn't acceptable."" The intent isn't to keep all the fire out. But to hold wildfires in the hills by choking off their fuel supply. That makes defending the town manageable. ""Its the difference between living in a matchbox and a place thats more resistant"" ""The fire is going to come through, but it won't be a big, tall, fire front,"" Kellogg, who previously fought fires for 35 years, said. These changes are subtle, perhaps even imperceptible to the casual observer. Nearly all the flammable vegetation below a field of oak trees may be removed along the road but the trees remain amid the naked ground. Or, lines of cactus replace fire-prone trees. Cleared out ground vegetation along the high road. Image: Mark Kaufman These focused lines of defense proved valuable for firefighters during the approaching December 16 firestorm. ""The firemen said when they were in Montecito there was a comfort level,"" noted Kellogg. ""You feel like you could safely let the fire come to you."" The same cleared routes also allow people an improved means of escape if necessary. In rapidly-moving fires over the past year, both law enforcement and the public found themselves in ""tunnels of fire"" as flames incinerated the vegetation around them. Cleared vegetation on the right, with sparse vegetation on the hill above the road (distance). Image: Mark Kaufman ""If we remove vegetation on both sides of the road, that allows people to not have that tunnel of fire,"" said Kolden. The ability to safely flee on short notice is also critical because staying put simply isn't an option in the U.S. Folks in fire country don't have anywhere to seek refuge, like underground bunkers to hide away from the (fire)storm. SEE ALSO: This scientist keeps winning money from people who bet against climate change Sure, some homes may be fire resistant, but can't necessarily withstand an indomitable urban conflagration, like that in Paradise. ""I would say that unless somebody has an asphalt donut around their house and their house is made of concrete, that's [staying] not a great option,"" Alison Green, program coordinator for Project Wildfire, a government disaster organization in Deschutes County, Oregon, said in an interview. ""As much as we can, we like to move people out of the way,"" added Green. Raining embers Even before a large wildfire hits town, its embers will start raining down upon roofs and vegetation. It's how a fire effectively spreads, sometimes well in advance of the flames. It's what happened in Paradise. ""All it takes is one house,"" said Kolden. ""Once they start burning it's really tough to stop them."" But Montecito urges its residents to clear out their yards, put mesh screening over vents (to block embers), and harden their homes in other ways, such as non-flammable roofs. In fact, it's state law that homeowners in fire country maintain 100 feet of cleared out ""defensible space"" around their houses. That Montecito has professionals ensuring or promoting these defensive measures is critical to its fire resistance. ""What makes Montecito different is there's always been a wildfire specialist thats always been their job,"" said Kellogg, who watched the flames burning above town in December 2017. Falling embers are inevitable. So if all the houses in the neighborhood are resistant to catching fire, a big conflagration will have a difficult time igniting amid an unsuspecting, or still evacuating neighborhood. ""You need to have all the houses hardened against fire, so there's a herd immunity against fire,"" said Kolden. Montecito vs Paradise Paradise and Montecito are both situated in fire country, but they're quite different. Paradise is a working-class community surrounded by pine forest, whereas Montecito is one of the nation's wealthiest enclaves, settled amid Southern California's shrublands, gnarled oak trees, and the state's towering, ubiquitous weed, eucalyptus. The circumstances around the respective extreme fires were different, too. Montecito had been acutely aware of the Thomas Fire for weeks, and firefighters were prepared to make a stand. ""Fires never will be the same,"" noted Kellogg. But robust defensive fire lines and intelligent clearing of flammable brush a method of fire prevention Montecito takes seriously would almost certainly have helped the now-gutted town of Paradise. After sparking, the Camp Fire reached the mountain community of Paradise in just 3.5 hours. Once there, it raged right through, consuming wooden homes. It's velocity shocked fire scientists. People burned alive in their cars. ""It gives people the time they need to escape,"" said Kolden of Montecito's defensive efforts. ""I have to believe that would have made a huge difference in Paradise."" Because future megafires are inevitable, ever spurred on by a warming world and drying land, developing a Montecito-like fire-resistance may no longer be a choice. These modern infernos will undoubtedly come for other towns, like they did for Paradise. ""There are hundreds of Paradise communities out there,"" John Bailey, a fire ecologist at Oregon State University, said in an interview. Crippling the megafires Wildfires are complex beasts. Today's disastrous blazes are the confluence of weather, a warming climate, mismanaged forests, and development in fire country. Hazy-smoke skies, with wooded Montecito on left and a cleared out high road driveway on right. Image: Mark Kaufman Yet just as the potent role of climate change can't be ignored in parching the land and helping to produce record dryness, either can the role of long-suppressed wildfires in the U.S. Wildfires will always come to town, but they can arrive in less mighty forms. ""Part of the solution is not to suppress fires,"" said Oregon State's Bailey. For well over half a century, the U.S. government has quashed forest fires, which naturally thin out the forests. ""There are hundreds of Paradise communities out there"" ""Post World War ll we not only had a culture to suppress fires, but we had new technology for it,"" said Bailey, noting that the Interior Department established a well-organized system of lookout towers, air tankers, and trucks. There was also a slight cooling trend in the 1950s, 1960s, and into the 1970s, owing to large-scale shifts in the dominant Pacific Ocean (though this certainly didn't stop nor diminish today's longer-term warming trend). ""It was pretty easy to put fires out,"" said Bailey. ""I did it for three years Im guilty."" But today, on top of overgrown forests, is the reality of accelerated global warming. ""Now were in a climatic period where the fire seasons are getting longer and deeper, hotter and drier, and maybe even windier,"" he emphasized. Thinning out these forests, however, requires federal funding and commitment. And that commitment isn't there. Cleared land along Montecito's high road system. Image: Mark Kaufman Bailey cites the 400,000-some acres of ponderosa pine (a common, fire-vulnerable tree) areas in Oregon's greater Deschutes National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service only burns, or treats, around 2,000 acres a year, he said. ""Do the math on that,"" said Bailey. ""In a big fire event, it doesn't even slow it down."" But thinning forests won't slow every fire. The recent Woolsey Fire, south of Montecito, largely burned scrublands and grasslands. There were no overgrown forests to eliminate. It was just a bad fire, helped along by seasonal winds and increasingly dried-out land. This makes Montecito's defenses all the more relevant. The fires will continue coming, and these wild woodlands, which sustain life, water, and tranquility, are more susceptible to flame. ""Its a watershed, it's a walk in the woods, but its also fuel,"" said Bailey. ""And its going to burn.""","In the early hours of December 16, 2017, hot embers began raining down on the Southern California town of Montecito.

Russ Frushtick,"Sea of Thieves is a role-playing game in the truest sense of the phrase, and the exchange below exemplifies its highs and lows. You are a pirate. You’re not a stealthy merchant with a silver tongue or a dwarven archer. There is only one choice in this world: pirate. Do. Not. Fucking. Stop. He’s right behind us. I know, I know! Just keep going. Turn sails to starboard! Which is that? Right! Fine, just say “ right ” from now on. Shit, they’re gaining on us. How is that possible? It’s only a little ship ! We can’t lose all this treasure — it took us, like, an hour. We can make it. It’ll be — WAIT, holy shit, he’s on our boat ! WHAT?! He’s here! And his buddy is shooting at us! Repair! Repair? Where are the planks? Wait, why the hell are we stopped? Oh shit. He dropped our anchor. I’ll try lifting it a g— nope, I’m dead. Me too. We’re sinking. He’s doing a dance. Cool. You drink, you sail, you dig up treasure, you attack other pirates and steal their treasure. You know, pirate-y stuff. Diving into something so all-encompassingly pirate is pretty overwhelming at the start. Sea of Thieves gives you next to no direction on what you should be doing, apart from some brief tutorial pop-ups. Unless you’re willing to go online and hunt for it, you’ll basically spend the first few hours figuring out how to sail, how to do quests, and how to catch chickens in cages and sell them for a tidy profit. If you’ve got the patience, these first few hours are thrilling. Managing to coordinate your crew well enough to get multiple sails full of wind as you bound off massive breakers is a rush rarely felt in games. It rewards player coordination in a natural way, not one that requires you piece together some arcane riddle as you might in a Destiny raid. One person’s on sails, one person’s steering, one person’s giving directions and another is acting as lookout. When everyone’s doing their job, it’s finely tuned majesty. That journey across the waves is also visually astounding. No game has ever come close to simulating the terrible ocean better than Sea of Thieves. The first storm you sail through is a sky full of fury, with lighting cracking on the deck, bursting holes into your hull and filling your hold with briny deep. The helmsman fights the wheel as he attempts to steer through a trio of rock formations as every crewmate is below deck trying to fix the wreckage. And then suddenly the sky clears, the sea calms and a gorgeous sunset is laid before you. Relief fills you, just as the last bailing bucketfuls are tossed overboard. It’s incredible. After those first few hours, though, the redundancy begins to set in. In seafaring terms, it’s called the doldrums. And I’m sad to say that the doldrums extend into the foreseeable future of Sea of Thieves, at least until the game is dramatically updated. The first time you do a mission, whether it’s finding buried treasure or fighting a horde of skeletons, it’s just as thrilling as that storm you survived. And then you begin to realize that all subsequent quests are basically randomly generated copies of that first mission. Go to island X instead of island Y. Dig here instead of there. Deliver two white chickens instead of one red chicken. People bemoan Bethesda’s algorithmically generated missions in games like Fallout 4 and Skyrim, but at least they have a ton of handcrafted stuff as well. The vast majority of Sea of Thieves is made up of random, dreary missions. I’m sad to say that the doldrums extend into the foreseeable future of Sea of Thieves It’s then that Sea of Thieves starts to feel routine. Sailing across the open ocean becomes less of a thrilling embodiment of cooperation and more of a chore. Role-playing games typically solve this stagnation by giving the player increased powers to cut through the monotony faster. Missions that used to take you an hour might take you a fifth of that, thanks to a faster ship or better guns. The idea of expanding the arsenal aboard your ship until it’s something truly dreadful to behold is exciting. But that idea is simply not in Sea of Thieves. Rare/Microsoft Studios All you can work for in the game are cosmetic upgrades. Your gold, earned from quests, goes into a new eye patch, a new pistol skin (that works exactly the same as your old one), a cooler-looking tankard of ale. I get the rationale. It sucks to be fully outgunned by kids who have been playing for hundreds of hours when all you have is a Sunday morning’s worth of time. It also means you’ll never be left behind by friends who are more advanced than you are. And honestly, if the minute-to-minute gameplay of Sea of Thieves were more interesting and complex, limiting things to cosmetics would be fine. Other games work with that model. But those games also succeed on the strength of their combat or the variety of their content, whereas Sea of Thieves never seems to offer very much to keep you engaged. Even the unique aspect of Sea of Thieves, the player-versus-player combat, has limits. I’ve seen players come up with amazing tactical strategies to broadside ships, board them and make off with the treasure, but since everyone is generally equipped with the same tools, there are only so many ways that ship-to-ship combat can currently play out. Rare/Microsoft Studios That’s not to mention that those who wish to just sail around peacefully with their friends — simply completing missions and chatting with each other — can be out of luck. The folks who like the feeling of earning more gold and buying different hats for their characters are liable to get steamrolled by well-coordinated, aggressive PvP players who crush their puny boats into splinter. Unlike in games such as The Division, which has discrete PvP areas, there’s nowhere in Sea of Thieves that’s safe from torment. You just have to hope your luck holds out. As for those dedicated PvP players, there’s no real upside to marauding. There’s no faction that rewards you for PvP, and the odds of getting really high-end loot from another player’s ship are totally arbitrary. You’d make way more money just going around doing missions yourself than you would chasing silhouettes on the horizon that may have an incredible fortune onboard. Sea of Thieves has the foundation of an incredible experience. It is a true pirate game that simulates the experience of piracy perfectly. And yet, after those first few jaw-dropping hours, you’re going to start feeling less like Blackbeard and more like Blackbeard’s accountant.

Doris Elin Salazar,"Communication systems are an integral part of daily life, but the sun can disrupt them by triggering powerful geomagnetic storms. To forecast these disturbances — which could affect GPS systems, air travel, national security and life-saving communications — scientists recently modeled the Earth data in 3D, an upgrade from one-dimensional predecessors. The sun releases radiation, some of which helps support life on Earth. This includes heat and visible light. But the sun also emits more-dangerous rays, and the blue planet's magnetosphere protects Earthlings from this radiation. Occasionally, however, intense solar events like flares send high levels of radiation toward Earth. When that radiation arrives and interacts with the magnetosphere, a geomagnetic storm can form. The planet feels its impact in many ways: Sometimes, the northern and southern lights manifest at Earth's poles, but the radiation can also cause communication systems to fail. This artist illustration depicts events on the sun that can change the conditions in near-Earth space. Space weather begins with an eruption such as a huge burst of light and radiation called a solar flare or a gigantic cloud of solar material called a coronal mass ejection.

""Our study suggests that 3D data of the Earth should be used whenever they are available,"" Greg Lucas, research physicist at the USGS and lead author of the study, said in a recent statement about the new findings, which were published Feb. 26 in the journal Space Weather. Using 3D modeling to gain a better understanding of the complex structures below the measurement sites, scientists can better determine which U.S. sites are most vulnerable to blackouts when powerful geomagnetic storms strike. The Earth's magnetosphere deflects some of the solar wind.

By modeling this scenario in 3D, the USGS scientists found 62 vulnerable sites that the 1D model did not catch. ""This discrepancy between 1D- and 3D-based calculations of the 1989 storm demonstrates the importance of realistic data, rather than relying on previous 1D models, to determine the impact that a geomagnetic storm has on power grids,"" Lucas said in the statement.

The Houston Ship Channel was shut on Sunday as violent storms wracked the site of one of the worst Gulf Coast 
industrial disasters in 14 years.
All outbound vessels emerging from the northwest end of the waterway were halted and inbound traffic was limited to ships and barges already en route to final destinations, 
Intercontinental Terminals Co LLC said in a statement.
Decontamination stations used by the U.S. Coast Guard to make sure ships don’t drag any toxic residue into Galveston Bay or the Gulf of Mexico also were closed, according to the statement.
The channel, Houston’s lifeline to the Gulf and to foreign markets, has been shut or under strict limitations since ITC’s complex 
erupted into flames three weeks ago and spewed dangerous oil byproducts into the air and water.
ITC crews were in the process of draining tanks holding xylene and naphtha -- highly volatile gasoline ingredients -- when severe thunderstorms rolled through Houston’s eastern suburbs on Sunday, spawning a tornado warning. A company spokesman said he didn’t know if the 
layers of foam used to secure the chemicals in damaged tanks had been disrupted.
The disaster site will be inspected on Monday, according to the statement. As of early April 6 there had been 39 cases of wildlife deaths attributed to the incident, including red-eared slider turtles, opossums and various types of birds and fish, ITC said.

Elizabeth Howell,"Giant donut-shaped swaths of magnetically trapped, highly energetic charged particles surround Earth. James Van Allen, a physicist at the University of Iowa, discovered these radiation belts in 1958 after the launch of Explorer 1, the first U.S. satellite. The radiation belts were eventually named after him. Van Allen's experiment on Explorer 1, which launched Jan. 31, 1958, had a simple cosmic ray experiment consisting of a Geiger counter (a device that detects radiation) and a tape recorder. Follow-up experiments on three other missions in 1958 — Explorer 3, Explorer 4 and Pioneer 3 — established that there were two belts of radiation circling the Earth. While observations have continued for decades, our knowledge of the belts became more enhanced when the Van Allen Probes launched in 2012. They found that the belts were more complex than previously imagined. The probes showed that the shape of the belts depends on what particle is being studied. They also uncovered information hinting there is less radiation than imagined in certain parts of the Van Allen belts, which means spacecraft and humans would not need as much radiation protection if they are voyaging in that region. On the 60th anniversary of Explorer 1, NASA said that studies of the Van Allen belts are even more important today. ""Our current technology is ever more susceptible to these accelerated particles because even a single hit from a particle can upset our ever smaller instruments and electronics,"" said David Sibeck, Van Allen Probes mission scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, in a 2018 statement. ""As technology advances, it's actually becoming even more pressing to understand and predict our space environment."" Part of the interest in the Van Allen belts comes from where they are located. It is known that the belts can swell when the sun becomes more active. Before the probes launched, scientists thought the inner belt was relatively stable, but when it did expand, its influence extended over the orbit of the International Space Station and several satellites. The outer belt fluctuated more often. The ISS has been permanently inhabited since 2000, with typical astronauts staying there for six months at a time. In 2015-16, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko remained there for almost a year. As astronauts stay in orbit for longer, their radiation exposure may also increase, leading to concerns about long-term habitation for astronauts in space. So scientists are interested in close study of this region. In 2012, a new set of probes launched. The Van Allen Probes (formerly known as the Radiation Belt Storm probes) have several scientific goals, including discovering how the particles — ions and electrons — in the belts are accelerated and transported, how electrons are lost and how the belts change during geomagnetic storms. The mission was planned to last two years, but as of May 2018 the probes were still operating at more than double the expected mission lifetime. However, fuel reserves are running low and the probes will likely retire in the next couple of years. Usually, scientists take a few months after launch to calibrate their instruments, but a team with the Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope asked that their instrument be turned on almost immediately (three days after launch); they wanted to compare observations before another mission, SAMPEX (Solar, Anomalous, and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer), de-orbited and entered Earth's atmosphere. ""It was a lucky decision,"" NASA said in February 2013, noting that a solar storm had already caused the radiation belts to swell as soon as the instrument was turned on. ""Then something happened no one had ever seen before: the particles settled into a new configuration, showing an extra, third belt extending out into space,"" the agency added. ""Within mere days of launch, the Van Allen Probes showed scientists something that would require rewriting textbooks."" An artist's depiction of the two Van Allen probes orbiting Earth. Credit: JHU/APL Data gathered by the probes also showed that the radiation belts shield Earth from high-energy particles. ""The barrier for the ultrafast electrons is a remarkable feature of the belts,"" study lead author Dan Baker, of the University of Colorado in Boulder, said in a statement. ""We're able to study it for the first time, because we never had such accurate measurements of these high-energy electrons before."" [ Gallery: NASA's Van Allen Probes ] This new information helped scientists model the belts' changes. But there was more information to come. In January 2016, scientists revealed that the shape of the belts depends on what type of electron is being studied. This means the two belts are much more complex; depending on what is being observed, they can be a single belt, two separate belts or just an outer belt (with no inner belt at all.) ""The researchers found that the inner belt — the smaller belt in the classic picture of the belts — is much larger than the outer belt when observing electrons with low energies, while the outer belt is larger when observing electrons at higher energies,"" NASA wrote at the time. ""At the very highest energies, the inner belt structure is missing completely. So, depending on what one focuses on, the radiation belts can appear to have very different structures simultaneously."" What is still poorly understood, however, is what happens when particles from the sun hit the belts during a geomagnetic storm. It is known that the number of electrons in the belts changes, either decreasing or increasing depending on the situation. Also, the belts eventually return to their normal shape after the storm passes. NASA said it isn't clear what kind of storm will cause a specific type of belt configuration. Also, the agency noted, any previous observations were done only with electrons at a few energy levels. More work needs to be done. Luckily, scientists got the chance to observe a storm up close in March 2015, when one of the Van Allen Probes happened to be situated inside the ""right"" spot in Earth's magnetic field to see an interplanetary shock. NASA describes such shocks as similar to when a tsunami is triggered by an earthquake; in this case, a coronal mass ejection of charged particles from the sun creates a shock in specific areas of the belts. ""The spacecraft measured a sudden pulse of electrons energized to extreme speeds — nearly as fast as the speed of light — as the shock slammed the outer radiation belt,"" NASA wrote at the time. ""This population of electrons was short-lived, and their energy dissipated within minutes. But five days later, long after other processes from the storm had died down, the Van Allen Probes detected an increased number of even higher energy electrons. Such an increase so much later is a testament to the unique energization processes following the storm."" In 2017, the Washington Post published an article with some of the sounds of space recorded from an instrument on the Van Allen Probes, called Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science (EMFISIS). Although humans cannot hear these sounds — because there is no medium in which the waves can carry the sound — translating this data was fairly straightforward, the Post wrote. ""The electromagnetic waves are in the same frequency range as the part of the sound spectrum that is audible to humans. It was a simple matter to translate those radio waves as MP3s — turning EMFISIS data into a radio broadcast from the heavens."" The Van Allen Probes are specially hardened to withstand the intense radioactive environment of the belts. Some spacecraft, however, are more vulnerable — especially when a solar storm hits. At worst, spacecraft can short out due to an electrical overload. Communications can also be disrupted. Fortunately, sometimes instruments can be turned on or off on a spacecraft during a solar storm. The shape of the Van Allen belts can vary widely depending on how energetic the individual electrons are, and general conditions in the Earth’s magnetic environment. During geomagnetic storms (4), all three regions in the belts can balloon. Credit: NASA GODDARD/DUBERSTEIN Radiation, of course, also poses a human risk. Astronauts are subject to lifetime radiation limits from their time in space, to reduce any risk of cancer. Since only a few dozen people have spent six months or longer in space, however, it will take decades to understand the long-term effects of radiation on humans. The astronauts on the ISS do not regularly spend time inside the belts, but from time to time solar storms expand the belts to the orbit of the space station. In the 1960s, several Apollo crews went through the Van Allen belts on their way to and from the moon. Their time in that radiation-intensive region, however, was very short, in part because the trajectory was designed to pass through the thinnest known parts. With more study, astronauts can be better protected for long-term stays in Earth orbit. ""We study radiation belts because they pose a hazard to spacecraft and astronauts,"" said David Sibeck, the Van Allen Probes mission scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, in an August 2016 NASA statement. ""If you knew how bad the radiation could get, you would build a better spacecraft to accommodate that."" Newer findings from the probes show that radiation in certain zones may be less harsh than scientists thought. In March 2017, the Van Allen Probes made a finding showing there is less radiation in the inner belts that previously theorized, which means less shielding is required for spacecraft and satellites in that region. The most energetic electrons residing in the inner radiation belt are there for less time than scientists thought beforehand. The following year, the probes discovered that some communications wavelengths (called very low frequency communications) emanating from Earth are sometimes a sort of a shield against high-energy particle radiation in space. This means that human activity has effects even in the near-space environment around Earth. As of 2018, the Van Allen Probes are running low on fuel and are expected to finish their mission around 2020. Goddard is working on a CubeSat (small spacecraft) mission called GTOSat that will continue studying the Van Allen belts. ""This mission of firsts will serve as a pathfinder for new radiation-tolerant technologies that could help scientists realize a long-sought dream: deploying a constellation of small satellites beyond low-Earth orbit to gather simultaneous, multi-point measurements of Earth's ever-changing magnetosphere, which protects the planet from the constant assault of charged particles streaming off the sun,"" NASA said in May 2018.","The Van Allen radiation belts are giant swaths of magnetically trapped, highly energetic charged particles that surround Earth.",2018-05-11T10:40:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Space.com'}",Van Allen Radiation Belts: Facts & Findings,https://www.space.com/33948-van-allen-radiation-belts.html,https://img.purch.com/h/1000/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzAyNi82MzYvb3JpZ2luYWwvbmFzYS1lYXJ0aC1yYWRpYXRpb24tYmVsdC1kaXNjb3ZlcnkuanBn,,Space.com,storm complex,1
